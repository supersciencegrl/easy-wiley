      <title>A Bis&#8208;Acridinium Macrocycle as Multi&#8208;Responsive Receptor and Selective Phase Transfer Agent of Perylene</title>
      <dc:description>A bis&#8208;acridinium cyclophane incorporating switchable acridinium moieties linked by a 3,5&#8208;dipyridylanisole spacer was studied as a multi&#8208;responsive host for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon guests. Complexation of perylene was proven to be the most effective and was characterized in particular by a charge transfer band as signal output. Effective catch and release of the guest was triggered by both chemical (proton/hydroxide) and redox stimuli. Moreover, the dicationic host was also easily switched between organic and perfluorocarbon phases for application related to the enrichment of perylene from a mixture of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.</dc:description>

      <title>Pushing the limits of precious metal atom economy for three&#8208;way&#8208;catalysts (TWC): thermally stable and highly active single Rh atom catalysts (Rh1/ceria) for NO abatement</title>
      <dc:description>We show for the first time that atomically dispersed Rh cations on ceria, prepared via high&#8208;temperature atom trapping synthesis, are the active species for (CO+NO) reaction. This provides a direct link with the organometallic homogeneous Rh(I) complexes capable of catalyzing dry (CO+NO) reaction but without the stability concern. In particular, thermally stable Rh cations in 0.1wt% Rh1/CeO2 achieve full NO conversion with a TOF of ~ 330 hr&#8208;1 per Rh atom at 120 &#8304;C.&#160; Under dry conditions, the main product above 100 &#8304;C is N2 with N2O being the minor product. The presence of water promotes low&#8208;temperature activity of 0.1wt% Rh1/CeO2 starting at 50 &#8304;C with full NO conversion at ~120 &#8304;C. In the case with the wet stream, however, ammonia and nitrogen are the main products with only minor N2O amounts. NH3 formation at such low temperatures is attractive because of the potential to use this as a passive SCR system. Because of the uniformity of Rh ions on the support, we are able to observe the intermediates of (CO+NO) reaction via infrared measurements on Rh cations on zeolite and ceria. Furthermore, we show that ammonia formation correlates with the WGS activity of the material and thus, rhodium hydride Rh&#8208;H species are involved in this reaction: we detect Rh(CO)Hx species on ceria using isotopic IR measurements. These findings provide new mechanistic understanding for the catalytically active species in TWC catalysis and open up a new avenue for the synthesis of novel emissions control catalysts with 100% atom economy of ultra&#8208;expensive precious metals such as Rh.</dc:description>

      <title>Designing Atomic Active Centers for Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalysts</title>
      <dc:description>
Center of attention: This Review gives an overview of methods to investigate HER&#8208;active atomic centers and discusses active sites with different coordination configurations. Active centers with one metal atom, two different metal atoms, as well as nonmetal atoms are analyzed at the atomic scale. Future research perspectives are also proposed. HER=hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
The evolution of hydrogen from water using renewable electrical energy is a topic of current interest. Pt/C exhibits the highest catalytic activity for the H2 evolution reaction (HER), but scarce supplies and high cost limit its large&#8208;scale application. Atomic active centers in single&#8208;atom catalysts, single&#8208;atom alloys, and catalysts with two atom sorts exhibit maximum atomic efficiency, unique structure, and exceptional activity for the HER. Interactions between well&#8208;defined active sites and supports are known to affect electron transfer and dramatically accelerate the reaction. This Review first highlights methods for studying atomic active centers for the HER. Then, active sites with different coordination configurations are described. Active centers with one metal atom, two different metal atoms as well as nonmetal atoms are analyzed at the atomic scale. Finally, future research perspectives are proposed.

      <title>Conductive and Elastic TiO2 Nanofibrous Aerogels: A New Concept toward Self&#8208;Supported Electrocatalysts with Superior Activity and Durability</title>
      <dc:description>Recently, various titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanostructures have received increasing attention in the fields of energy conversion and storage due to extraordinary electrochemical properties. However, these particulate nanomaterials exclusively exist in the powder form, which may cause health risks and environmental hazards. Here we report a novel, highly elastic bulk form of TiO2  for safe use and easy recycling. Specifically, TiO2  nanofibrous aerogels (NAs) consisting of resiliently bonded, flexible TiO2  nanofibers are constructed, which are featured by ultralow bulk density, ultrahigh porosity, and excellent elasticity. To further promote the charge transfer, they are subjected to the lithium reduction to generate abundant oxygen vacancies, which can modulate the electronic structures of TiO2, resulting in a conductivity up to 38.2 mS cm&#8211;1. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, the conductive and elastic TiO2  NAs serve as a new type of self&#8208;supported electrocatalysts for ambient nitrogen fixation, achieving an ammonia yield of 4.19&#215;10&#8211;10  mol s&#8211;1  cm&#8211;2  and a Faradaic efficiency of 20.3% as determined by the indophenol blue method. The origin of the superior electrocatalytic activity is revealed by DFT calculations.</dc:description>

      <title>Renal Secretion Pathway&#8208;dependent Efflux Transport Enabled Hyperfluorescence Imaging of Kidney Cancer</title>
      <dc:description>Renal tubular secretion is an active efflux pathway for the kidneys to remove molecules but has never been used to enhance kidney cancer targeting. Herein, we report the first renal tubule&#8208;secretable near infrared&#8208;emitting fluorophore, indocyanine green (ICG) conjugated with a 2100 Da PEG molecule (ICG&#8208;PEG45) and its advantages in hyperfluorescence imaging of kidney cancers, which cannot be achieved with hepatobiliary&#8208; and glomerular&#8208;clearable ICG. This pathway&#8208;dependent targeting of kidney cancer fundamentally arises from the fact that the secretion pathway enabled ICG&#8208;PEG45 to be effectively effluxed out of normal proximal tubules through P&#8208;glycoprotein transporter while being retained in the kidney cancerous tissues with low P&#8208;glycoprotein expression. Tuning elimination pathways and utilizing different efflux kinetics of medical agents in normal and diseased tissues could be a new strategy, in addition to well&#8208;known vasculature&#8208;based passive and ligand&#8208;receptor mediated active targeting, for tackling challenges in disease diagnosis and treatments.</dc:description>

      <title>Tuning gate&#8208;opening of a flexible metal&#8208;organic framework for ternary gas sieving separation</title>
      <dc:description>In comparison with the fast development of binary mixture separations, ternary mixture separations are significantly more difficult and have rarely been realized by a single material. Herein, a new strategy of tuning the gate&#8208;opening pressure of flexible MOFs is developed to tackle such a challenge.

Therefore, efficient sieving separation of this ternary mixture was realized. Under optimized temperature, NTU&#8208;65 adsorbed a large amount of C2H2 and CO2 through gate&#8208;opening and only negligible amount of C2H4. Breakthrough experiments demonstrated that this material can simultaneously capture C2H2 and CO2, yielding polymer grade (&gt;99.99%) C2H4 from single breakthrough separation.</dc:description>

      <title>Metal halide regulated photophysical turning of zero&#8208;dimensional organic metal halide hybrids: from efficient phosphorescence to ultralong afterglow.</title>
      <dc:description>Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic metal halide hybrids have emerged as a new class of luminescent materials with exceptional structural and photophysical tunability, thanks to the rich choices of organic cations and metal halides for the formation of ionically bonded systems. Here we report photophysical tuning of a series of tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP) metal halide hybrids containing distinct metal halides, TPP  2  MX  n  (MX  n  = SbCl  5  , MnCl  4  , ZnCl  4  , ZnCl  2  Br  2  , ZnBr  4  ), from efficient phosphorescence to ultralong afterglow. It is found that the afterglow properties of TPP  +  cations could be suspended for the hybrids containing low bandgap emissive metal halide species, such as SbCl  5  2&#8208;  and MnCl  4  2&#8208;  , but significantly enhanced for the hybrids containing wide bandgap non&#8208;emissive ZnCl  4  2&#8208;  . Structural and photophysical studies reveal that the enhanced afterglow is attributed to stronger &#960; &#8208; &#960; stacking and intermolecular electronic coupling between TPP  +  cations in TPP  2  ZnCl  4  than in the pristine organic ionic compound TPPCl. Moreover, the afterglow in TPP  2  ZnX  4  can be tuned by controlling the halide composition, with the change from Cl to Br resulting in a shorter afterglow due to heavy atom effect.</dc:description>

      <title>A Polymorphic Azobenzene Cage for Energy Efficient and Highly Selective p&#8208;Xylene Separation</title>
      <dc:description>Developing the competency of molecular sorbents for energy&#8208;saving applications, such as C8 separations, requires efficient, stable, scalable and easily recyclable materials that can readily transition to commercial implementation. Here, we report an azobenzene&#8208;based cage for the selective separation of&#160;  p  &#8208;xylene isomer across a range of C8 isomers in both vapor and liquid states with selectivity that is higher than the reported all&#8208;organic sorbents.

This cage is stable in solution and can be regenerated directly under vacuum to be used in multiple cycles. We envisage that this work will promote the investigation of the azo bond as well as guest induced crystal to crystal phase transition in non&#8208;porous organic solids for pivotal energy intensive separations.</dc:description>

      <title>Photo&#8208;effect on ion transport in mixed cation and halide perovskites and implications for photo demixing</title>
      <dc:description>Lead halide perovskites are considered to be most promising photovoltaic materials. Highest efficiency and improved stability of perovskite solar cells have been achieved by using cation and anion mixtures. Experimental information on electronic and ionic charge carriers is key to evaluate device performance, as well as processes of photo&#8208;decomposition and photo&#8208;demixing which are observed in these materials. Here, we measure ionic and electronic transport properties and investigate various cation and anion substitutions with a special eye on their photo&#8208;ionic effect, following our previous study on CH 3  NH 3  PbI 3  , where we found that light enhances not only electronic but also ionic conductivities. We find that this phenomenon is very sensitive to the nature of the halide, while the cationic substitutions are less relevant. Based on the observation that the ionic conductivity enhancement found for iodide perovskites is significantly weakened by bromide substitution, we provide a chemical rationale for the photo&#8208;demixing in mixed halide compositions.</dc:description>

      <title>Metal Nanozyme with Ester Hydrolysis Activity in the Presence of Ammonia&#8211;Borane and Its Use in a Sensitive Immunosensor</title>
      <dc:description>Metal nanoparticle surfaces are used for peroxidase&#8208; and oxidase&#8208;like nanozymes but not for esterase&#8208;like nanozymes. It is challenging to obtain rapid catalytic hydrolysis on a metal surface and even more so without a catalytically labile substrate. Here, we report that metal nanoparticle surfaces rapidly catalyze non&#8208;redox ester hydrolysis in the presence of redox H 3  N&#8211;BH 3  (AB). Metal hydrides are readily generated on a Pt nanoparticle (PtNP) from AB, and as a result the PtNP becomes electron&#8208;rich, which might assist nucleophilic attack of H 2  O on the carbonyl group of an ester. The nanozyme system based on PtNP, AB, and 4&#8208;aminonaphthalene&#8208;1&#8208;yl acetate provides an electrochemical signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio much higher than natural enzymes, due to the rapid ester hydrolysis and redox cycling involving the hydrolysis product. The nanozyme system is applied in a sensitive electrochemical immunosensor for thyroid&#8208;stimulating hormone detection. The calculated detection limit is approximately 0.3 pg/mL, which indicates the high sensitivity of the immunosensor using the PtNP nanozyme.</dc:description>

      <title>&#8220;To jump or not&#8221;: manipulating light&#8208;induced dynamic macro&#8208;movement and static photonic properties within 1D isostructural hydrogen&#8208;bonded molecular crystals</title>
      <dc:description>Smart molecular crystals with light&#8208;driven mechanical responses have received intense interest owing to their potential uses in developing novel molecular machines, artificial muscles, and biomimetics. However, challenges remain in control over both the dynamic photo&#8208;mechanical behaviors and static photonic properties of molecular crystals that are based on the same molecule. Herein, we illustrate that the construction of isostructural co&#8208;crystals is an effective approach to tune on/off their light&#8208;induced cracking and jumping behaviors (photosalient effect). The hydrogen&#8208;bonded co&#8208;crystals organized from 4&#8208;(1&#8208;naphthylvinyl)pyridine (  NVP  ) along with co&#8208;formers (tetrafluoro&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid (  THA  ) and tetrafluorobenzoic acid (  TA  )) crystallize as isostructural crystals, but have notably different static and dynamic photo&#8208;mechanical behaviors. These differences are due to alternations in the relative orientation of  NVP  and hydrogen&#8208;bonding modes of the included co&#8208;formers. After light activation, the 1D  NVP&#8208;TA  crystal splits and shears off within 1 second, as a result from [2+2] cycloaddition of the olefin pair in  NVP  . For  NVP&#8208;THA  , its photostability and high quantum yield endow the 1D microstructure with novel photonic properties, including low optical waveguide loss (0.066 dB &#181;m  &#8722;1  ), highly polarized anisotropy (  r  =0.72) and efficient up&#8208;conversion fluorescence. Therefore, this work not only provides an isostructural hydrogen&#8208;bonded co&#8208;crystal strategy to manipulate light&#8208;induced dynamic movement and static photonic properties within 1D crystalline microstructures, but also affords a deep understanding regarding the role of hydrogen bonding in the construction of microscopic optical&#8211;mechanical responses in molecular systems.</dc:description>

      <title>Asymmetric Transformation Driven by Confinement and Self&#8208;Release in Single&#8208;Layered Porous Nanosheet</title>
      <dc:description>Asymmetric transformation requires the use of chiral catalysts which is hampered by energy intensive processes such as high cost, inefficient recycle, and tedious separation. Here we report the use of single&#8208;layered, chiral porous sheets with induced pore chirality for repeatable asymmetric transformation and self&#8208;separation without the need of chiral catalysts or chiral auxiliaries. The asymmetric induction is driven by chiral fixation of absorbed achiral substrates inside the chiral pores to transform into enantiopure products with enantioselectivity of greater than 99%  ee  . When the conversion is completed, the products are spontaneously separated out of the pores, enabling the porous sheets to perform repeated cycles of converting achiral substrates to release as chiral products without compromising pore performance, thereby confining achiral substrates into 2&#8208;D chiral porous materials provides access to a highly efficient alternative to current asymmetric synthesis methodologies.</dc:description>

      <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of the Anti&#8208;COVID&#8208;19 Drug Remdesivir</title>
      <dc:description>The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of the anti&#8208;COVID&#8208;19 drug remdesivir has been realized via the coupling of the P&#8208;racemic phosphoryl chloride with protected nucleoside GS441524. The chiral bicyclic imidazole catalyst is crucial for the dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DyKAT) to proceed smoothly with high reactivity and excellent stereoselectivity [96% conv., 22:1 P(S):P(R)]. Mechanistic studies showed that this DyKAT is a first&#8208;order visual kinetic reaction dependent on catalyst concentration. The unique chiral bicyclic imidazole skeleton and carbamate substituent of the catalyst are both required for the racemization process involving the phosphoryl chloride and subsequent stereodiscriminating step. A 10&#8208;gram scale reaction was also conducted with comparably excellent results, showing its potential for industrial application.</dc:description>

      <title>Sequential Solid&#8208;State Transformations Involving Consecutive Rearrangements of Secondary Building Units in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
      <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state transformations in metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) systems are important phenomena and have led to the creation of new MOF structures. Solid&#8208;state transformations from interpenetrated to non&#8208;interpenetrated networks involving rearrangement of secondary building units (SBUs) in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) fashion have not been explored to date. Herein, we report the sequential, thermally stimulated solid&#8208;state transformations in a barium&#8208;organic framework (  UPC&#8208;600  ). The two&#8208;fold interpenetrated framework of&#160;  UPC&#8208;600  &#160;is converted at 373 K to  UPC&#8208;601  , a&#160;non&#8208;interpenetrated framework. This proceeds in a SCSC fashion and involves the rearrangement of two proximate rod&#8208;shaped SBUs in different nets to generate a new rod&#8208;shaped SBU. At 473 K,&#160;a&#160;continuous solid&#8208;state transformation involving a second rearrangement&#160;occurred,&#160;  UPC&#8208;601  &#160;converted to  UPC&#8208;602  &#160;by the rearrangement of the 1D rod&#8208;shaped SBU to a 2D layer SBU. This is the first example of such a thermally&#8208;driven stepwise transformation involving simultaneous cleavage and regeneration of multiple bonds.&#160;This result will enable detailed studies of solid&#8208;state transformations, and encourages a deep understanding of the role of solid&#8208;state transformations in the synthesis of MOF materials.</dc:description>

      <title>In&#8208;syringe electrokinetic protein removal from biological samples prior to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry</title>
      <dc:description>Matrix effects can compromise ionization and hence reliability of electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS), making sample clean&#8208;up including protein removal critical in bioanalysis. Automation of protein removal protocols is challenging. Here, an electrokinetic extraction (EkE) syringe is presented allowing for on&#8208;line electrokinetic removal of serum proteins before ESI&#8208;MS. The method relies on the electrophoretic migration of charged serum proteins away from neutral target analytes in an electric field, applied across the syringe barrel utilizing the metallic syringe needle and plunger as electrodes. Under acidic conditions, most proteins are cationic facilitating their accumulation at an cathodic plunger. Similarly, under basic conditions, the anionic proteins aggregate near the anodic plunger. Actuation of the plunger enables infusion of the deproteinated sample remaining in the barrel into the ESI&#8208;MS for detection of acidic or basic molecules. The proposed concept is demonstrated by the determination of pharmaceuticals from human serum within minutes, with sample preparation limited to a 5x dilution of the sample in the background electrolyte (BGE) and application of voltage, both of which can be performed in&#8208;syringe. Signal enhancements of 3.6&#8208;32 fold relative to direct infusion of diluted serum and up to 10.8 fold enhancement, were obtained for basic and acidic pharmaceuticals, respectively. Linear correlations for the basic drugs by EkE&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS/MS were achieved, covering the necessary clinical range with LOQs of 5.3, 7.8, 6.1, and 17.8 ng/mL for clomipramine, chlorphenamine, pindolol, and atenolol, respectively. For the acidic drugs analysis, EkE&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS, the LOQs were 3.1 &#181;g/mL and 2.9 &#181;g/mL for naproxen and paracetamol, respectively. The EkE&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS and EkE&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS/MS methods showed good accuracy (%found of 81% to 120%), precision (&lt; 20%), and linearity (r &gt; 0.997) for all the studied drugs in spiked serum samples.</dc:description>

The EkE&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS and EkE&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS/MS methods showed good accuracy (%found of 81% to 120%), precision (&amp;lt; 20%), and linearity (r &amp;gt; 0.997) for all the studied drugs in spiked serum samples.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Single Carbon Fiber&#8208;Powered Microsensor for In Vivo Neurochemical Sensing with High Neuronal Compatibility</title>
      <dc:description>Developing new principles and techniques with high neuronal compatibility for quantitatively monitoring dynamics of neurochemicals is essential for deciphering brain chemistry and function. However, this pursuit remains a great challenge. We herein report a neuron&#8208;compatible method for  in vivo  neurochemical sensing by powering single carbon fiber based on spontaneous bipolar electrochemistry as a new sensing platform. By using ascorbic acid (AA) as a model target to prove the concept, we find that the single carbon fiber&#8208;powered microsensor exhibits a good response, high stability and, more importantly, excellent neuronal compatibility. In addition, the microsensor is also well compatible with electrophysiological recording, enabling synchronous recordings of both chemical and electrical signals. The sensing principle can be developed to be versatile for  in vivo  monitoring of various neurochemicals by rationally designing and tuning the electrochemical reactions at the two poles of carbon fiber.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of 2D germanane (GeH): a new, fast and facile approach</title>
      <dc:description>Germanane (GeH), a germanium analogue of graphane, has recently attracted considerable interest because its remarkable combination of properties makes it an extremely suitable candidate as 2D material for field effect devices, photovoltaics, and photocatalysis. Up to now, the synthesis of GeH has been conducted by substituting Ca by H in a  &#946;  &#8208;CaGe  2  layered Zintl phase through topochemical deintercalation in aqueous HCl. This reaction is generally slow and takes place over 6 to 14 days. The new and facile protocol presented here allows to synthesize GeH at room temperature in a significantly shorter time (a few minutes), which renders this method highly attractive for technological applications. The GeH produced with this method is highly pure and has a band gap (E  g  ) close to 1.4 eV, a lower value than that reported for germanane synthesized using HCl, which is promising for incorporation of GeH in solar cells.</dc:description>

      <title>How big is the pinacol boronic ester as a substituent?</title>
      <dc:description>The synthetically versatile pinacol boronic ester group (Bpin) is generally thought of as a bulky moiety due to the two adjacent quaternary sp  3  &#8208;hydribized carbon atoms in its diol backbone. However, recent diastereoselective reactions reported in the literature have cast doubt on this perception. Herein, we report a detailed experimental and computational analysis of Bpin and structurally related boronic esters which allows us to determine three different steric parameters for the Bpin group: the A&#8208;value, ligand cone angle, and percent buried volume. All three parameters suggest that the Bpin moiety is remarkably small, with the planarity of the oxygen&#8211;boron&#8211;oxygen motif playing an important role in minimising steric interactions. Of the three steric parameters, percent buried volume provides the best correlation between steric size and diastereoselectivity in a Diels&#8208;Alder reaction.</dc:description>

      <title>A De Novo Design of Fully Non&#8208;fused Ring Acceptor with Planar Backbone and Near&#8208;IR Absorption for High Performance Polymer Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>Fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors have made significant progress in recent years, while the development of fully non&#8208;fused ring acceptors has been unsatisfactory. Here, two fully non&#8208;fused ring acceptors, o  &#8208;4TBC&#8208;2F  and m  &#8208;4TBC&#8208;2F  , were designed and synthesized. By regulating the location of the hexyloxy chains, o  &#8208;4TBC&#8208;2F  formed planar backbones, while m  &#8208;4TBC&#8208;2F  displayed a twisted backbone. Additionally, the o  &#8208;4TBC&#8208;2F  film showed a markedly red&#8208;shifted absorption after thermal annealing, which indicated the formation of J  &#8208;aggregates. For fabrication of organic solar cells (OSCs), PBDB&#8208;T was used as a donor and blended with the two acceptors. The o  &#8208;4TBC&#8208;2F  &#8208;based blend films displayed high charge mobilities, lower energy loss and a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE). The optimized devices based on o  &#8208;4TBC&#8208;2F  gave a PCE of 10.26%, which was much higher than those based on m  &#8208;4TBC&#8208;2F  at 2.63%, and it is one of the highest reported PCE values for fully non&#8208;fused ring electron acceptors.</dc:description>

      <title>Zwitterionic peptide cloak mimics protein surfaces for protein protection</title>
      <dc:description>Inspired by the amino acid composition of natural protein surfaces, we developed a zwitterionic cloak containing multi&#8208;layers of short alternating glutamic acid and lysine (EK) peptides as a facile, highly effective and low&#8208;immunogenicity approach for the protection and delivery of biotherapeutics. Each EK layer grafted to proteins provides multiple times of new lysine reaction sites for the growth of subsequent EK layers. This unique design allows EK peptides to achieve high coating density on proteins, overcoming the limitation of traditional conjugation strategies that rely on the number of innate lysine groups. A triple&#8208;layer EK cloak manifests to successfully eliminate the specific and non&#8208;specific interactions of protected asparaginase, a highly immunogenic protein drug, with biological media while prolong the drug circulation time and significantly mitigate its&#160;immunogenicity in vivo, suggesting an EK peptide cloak as a promising approach to improve the safety and efficacy of biotherapeutics.</dc:description>

      <title>Interaction of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein with Phospholipids and the Associated Restructuring of Interfacial Lipid Water: An Interface&#8208;Selective Vibrational Spectroscopic Study</title>
      <dc:description>Interaction of a&#8208;Synuclein (aS) with biological lipid is crucial for the onset of its fibrillation at the cell membrane&#8208;water interface. Here, we probe the interaction of aS with membrane mimicking lipid monolayer&#8208;water interfaces using surface&#8208;selective heterodyne&#8208;detected vibrational sum frequency generation (HD&#8208;VSFG) spectroscopy. Our results depict that aS interacts negligibly with zwitterionic lipid, but strongly affects the pristine air&#8208;water and charged lipid&#8208;water interfaces by perturbing the structure and orientation of the interfacial water. Specifically, the net negative aS (&#8208;9 in bulk water; pH 7.4) reorients the water as hydrogen&#8208;up (H&#8208;up) at the air&#8208;water interface; electrostatically interacts&#160;with positively charged lipids, making the interface nearly net neutral. Strangely, aS also interacts with negatively charged lipids: the net H&#8208;up orientation of the interfacial water decreases at anionic lipid&#8208;water interface, revealing a domain&#8208;specific (positively charged N&#8208;terminal) interaction of net negative aS with the negatively charged lipids at membrane surface.</dc:description>

      <title>Cross&#8208;module Enoylreduction in the Azalomycin F Polyketide Synthase</title>
      <dc:description>The colinearity of canonical modular polyketide synthases, which creates a direct link between multienzyme structure and the chemical structure of the biosynthetic end&#8208;product, has become a cornerstone of knowledge&#8208;based genome mining.

      <title>Construction of Highly Active Metal&#8208;Containing Nanoparticles &amp; FeCo&#8208;N4 Composite Sites for Acid Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;containing nanoparticles (M&#8208;NPs) in metal/nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (M&#8208;N&#8208;C) catalysts have been considered hostile to acid oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Some works have confirmed that M&#8208;NPs can synergistically increase ORR activity in alkaline media. However, the relation between M&#8208;NPs and the active sites of metal coordinated with nitrogen (MNx) is hard to be established in acid medium due to the poor stability of M&#8208;NPs. Herein, we develop a strategy to successfully construct a new FeCo&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst containing the highly active M&#8208;NPs and MN4  composite sites (marked as M/FeCo&#8208;SAs&#8208;N&#8208;C). The enhanced catalytic activity and stability of M/FeCo&#8208;SAs&#8208;N&#8208;C is discovered in our systematic experiments. Moreover, theoretical calculation reveals that there is a strong interaction between M&#8208;NPs and FeN4  sites, which can favor ORR by activating the O&#8208;O bond, thus facilitating a direct 4e&#8208;  process. Those findings firstly shed light on the highly active M&#8208;NPs and FeN4  composite sites for catalyzing acid oxygen reduction reaction, and the relevant reaction mechanism is suggested.</dc:description>

      <title>Unusual Type II Polyketide Synthase System Involved in Cinnamoyl Lipid Biosynthesis</title>
      <dc:description>As a unique structural moiety in natural products, cinnamoyl lipid (CL), was proposed to be assembled  via  unusual type II polyketide synthases (PKSs).

      <title>Probing cooperativity of N&#8208;terminal domain orientations in the p97 molecular machine: synergy between NMR and cryo&#8208;EM</title>
      <dc:description>The hexameric p97 enzyme plays an integral role in cellular homeostasis. Large changes to the orientation of its N&#8208;terminal domains (NTDs), corresponding to NTD&#8208;down (p97&#8208;ADP) or NTD&#8208;up (p97&#8208;ATP), accompany ATP hydrolysis. The NTDs in a series of p97 disease mutants interconvert rapidly between up and down conformations when p97 is in the ADP&#8208;bound state. While the populations of up and down NTDs can be determined from bulk measurements, information about the cooperativity of the transition between conformations is lacking. Here we use cryo&#8208;EM to determine populations of the 14 unique up/down NTD states of the homo&#8208;hexameric R95G disease&#8208;causing p97 ring, showing that NTD orientations do not depend on those of neighbouring subunits. In contrast, NMR studies establish that inter&#8208;protomer cooperativity is important for regulating the orientation of NTDs in p97 particles comprising mixtures of different subunits, such as wild&#8208;type and R95G, emphasizing the synergy between cryo&#8208;EM and NMR in establishing how the components of p97 function.</dc:description>

      <title>Reversible soft&#8208;mechanochemical control of biaryl conformations through crosslinking in a 3D macromolecular network</title>
      <dc:description>Tuning the dihedral angle (DA) of axially chiral compounds can impact biological activity, catalyst efficiency, molecular motor performance, or chiroptical properties. Herein, we report gradual, controlled and reversible changes in molecular conformation of a covalently linked binaphthyl moiety, within a 3D polymeric network by the application of a macroscopic stretching force. We managed a direct observation of the DA changes by measuring the circular dichroism signal of an optically pure BINOL&#8208;crosslinked elastomer network. In accordance with computed spectra, stretching the elastomer resulted in a widening of the DA between naphthyl rings when the BINOL was doubly&#8208;grafted to the elastomer network, while no effect was observed when a single naphthyl ring of the BINOL was grafted to the elastomer network. Combining both experimental and theoretical results, we have determined that ~170% extension of the elastomers led to the transfer of a mechanical force to the BINOL moiety of 2.5 kcal*mol  &#8208;1  *&#197;  &#8208;1  (~175 pN) in magnitude and results in the opening of the DA of BINOL up to ~130&#176;.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tuning the dihedral angle (DA) of axially chiral compounds can impact biological activity, catalyst efficiency, molecular motor performance, or chiroptical properties. Herein, we report gradual, controlled and reversible changes in molecular conformation of a covalently linked binaphthyl moiety, within a 3D polymeric network by the application of a macroscopic stretching force. We managed a direct observation of the DA changes by measuring the circular dichroism signal of an optically pure BINOL&#8208;crosslinked elastomer network. In accordance with computed spectra, stretching the elastomer resulted in a widening of the DA between naphthyl rings when the BINOL was doubly&#8208;grafted to the elastomer network, while no effect was observed when a single naphthyl ring of the BINOL was grafted to the elastomer network. Combining both experimental and theoretical results, we have determined that ~170% extension of the elastomers led to the transfer of a mechanical force to the BINOL moiety of 2.5 kcal*mol  &#8208;1  *&#197;  &#8208;1  (~175 pN) in magnitude and results in the opening of the DA of BINOL up to ~130&#176;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Preparation of Nafion&#174; Membranes for Reliable Ammonia Quantification in Nitrogen Reduction Reaction Experiments</title>
      <dc:description>This study highlights the importance of following a strict protocol for Nafion&#174; membrane pretreatment for electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction experiments. It is shown how atmospheric ammonia pollutions can be introduced to the experimental setup through the membranes, therefore, interpreted falsely as catalysis product from N  2  . The sources of ammonia contamination vary drastically between different locations worldwide and even within the same location between days depending on temperature, wind direction, fertilizer use and manure accumulation in its vicinity. The study shows that significant amounts of ammonium is accumulated in the membranes after commonly practiced pretreatment methods, where the amount depends on the ammonia concentration in the surrounding of the experiment. Therefore, we introduce a new pretreatment method which removes all the ammonium in the membrane. The membranes can be stored for several days but a short final step in the method needs to be carried out right before NRR experiments.</dc:description>

      <title>A Robust Au&#8208;C&#8801;C Surface: Toward Real&#8208;time Mapping and Accurate Quantification of Fe2+ in the Live Brain of AD Model</title>
      <dc:description>A robust surface between molecules and electrodes is very important for constructing molecular and electronic devices. Here, it was first found that Au&#8208;C&#8801; C bond showed the highest stability under biological conditions containing abundant thiols and the best electrochemical performance compared to Au&#8208;S and Au&#8208;Se bonds. The new finding was also confirmed by theorical calculation. Based on the remarkable performance of Au&#8208;C &#8801; C bond, we designed and synthesized a specific molecule for recognition of Fe  2+  , and created a selective and accurate sensor for quantification of Fe  2+  , in&#160; which MB&#8208;DNA (Methylene Blue, MB) was employed as an inner&#8208;reference element. The present ratiometric strategy demonstrated high&#160;spatial resolution for real&#8208;time tracking of Fe  2+  in a dynamic range of 0.2&#8208;120 &#956;M. Finally, the microelectrode array with good biocompatibility was applied in imaging and biosensing of Fe  2+  in the different regions of live brain. Using our powerful tool, it was first discovered that the uptake of extracellular Fe  2+  into cortex and striatum was largely mediated by cyclic adenosine monophosphate&#160;(cAMP) through CREB&#8208;related pathway in AD mouse brain.</dc:description>

      <title>Redox Dyshomeostasis Strategy for Hypoxic Tumor Therapy  Based on DNAzyme&#8208;Loaded Electrophilic ZIFs</title>
      <dc:description>Redox   homeostasis  is one of the main reasons  for reactive oxygen species  (ROS) tolerance in hypoxic tumors, limiting ROS&#8208;mediated tumor therapy. Herein,  we propose a redox dyshomeostasis (RDH) strategy based on a nano&#8208;platform  FeCysPW@ZIF&#8208;82@CAT Dz to disrupt redox homeostasis and  apply  this strategy to improve ROS&#8208;mediated hypoxic tumor therapy. Once  endocytosed by tumor cells,  the catalase DNAzymes&#8208;loaded zeolitic imidazole framework&#8208;82 (ZIF&#8208;82@CAT Dz) shell can be degraded into Zn2+  as cofactors for CAT Dz&#8208;mediated CAT silencing and electrophilic ligands for glutathione (GSH) depletion under hypoxia, both of which lead to intracellular RDH and H2O2  accumulation.  These &#8220;disordered&#8221; cells show reduced resistance to ROS  and are effectively killed by ferrous cysteine&#8208;phosphotungstate (FeCysPW)&#8208;induced chemodynamic therapy (CDT).  In vitro  and  in vivo  data demonstrate that  the pH/hypoxia/H2O2  triple  stimuli&#8208;responsive nanocomposite can efficiently kill hypoxic tumors.

      <dc:description>Current approaches to design monodisperse protein assemblies require rigid, tight, and symmetric interactions between oligomeric protein units. Here, we introduce a new multivalent interaction&#8208;driven assembly strategy that allows flexible, spaced, and asymmetric assembly between protein oligomers. We discovered that two polygonal protein oligomers (ranging from triangle to hexagon) dominantly form a discrete and stable two&#8208;layered protein prism nanostructure via multivalent interactions between fused binding pairs. We demonstrated that protein nano&#8208;prisms with long flexible peptide linkers (over 80 residues) between protein oligomer layers could be discretely formed. Oligomers with different structures could also be monodispersely assembled into two&#8208;layered but asymmetric protein nano&#8208;prisms. Furthermore, producing higher&#8208;order architectures with multiple oligomer layers, for example, 3&#8208;layered nano&#8208;prisms or nanotubes, was also feasible.</dc:description>

      <title>Structural Phase Transitions of a Molecular Metal Oxide</title>
      <dc:description>The structural phase of a metal oxide changes with temperature and pressure. During phase transitions, component ions move in multi&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;oxygen networks. Such macroscopic structural events are robust to changes in particle size, even at scales of around 10 nm, and size effects limiting these transitions are particularly important in, for example, high&#8208;density memory applications of ferroelectrics. In this work, we examine structural transitions of the molecular metal oxide [Na@(SO  3  )  2  (  n  &#8208;BuPO  3  )  4  Mo  V  4  Mo  VI  14  O  49  ]  5&#8722;  (Molecule  1  ) at&#160;~2 nm, using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The Na  +  encapsulated in the discrete metal&#8208;oxide anion exhibited a reversible order&#8211;disorder transition with distortion of the Mo&#8211;O molecular framework induced by temperature. Similar order&#8211;disorder transitions were also triggered by chemical pressure induced by removing crystalline solvent molecules in the single&#8208;crystal state or by substituting the counter cation to change the molecular packing. Molecule  1  is&#160;the metal oxide in which a macroscopic structural transition has been observed.</dc:description>

      <title>Deoxygenative Fluorination of Phosphine Oxides: A General Route to Fluorinated Organophosphorus(V) Compounds and Beyond</title>
      <dc:description>Fluorinated organophosphorus(V) compounds are a very versatile class of compounds, but the synthetic methods available to make them bear the disadvantages of 1) occasional handling of toxic or pyrophoric P(III) starting materials and 2) a dependence on hazardous fluorinating reagents such as XeF  2  . Herein, we present a simple solution and introduce a deoxygenative fluorination (DOF) approach that utilizes easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle phosphine oxides as starting materials and effectively replaces harsh fluorinating reagents by a combination of oxalyl chloride and potassium fluoride. The reaction has proven to be general, as R  3  PF  2  , R  2  PF  3  , and RPF  4  compounds (as well as various cations and anions derived from these) are accessible in good yields and on up to a multi&#8208;gram scale. DFT calculations were used to bolster our observations. Notably, the discovery of this new method led to a convenient synthesis of 1) new difluorophosphonium ions, 2) hexafluorophosphate salts, and 3) fluorinated antimony&#8208; and arsenic&#8208; compounds.</dc:description>

Here, hypoxia&#8208;activated self&#8208;immolative paclitaxel prodrug (PTX  2  &#8208;Azo) was synthesized and combined with photodynamic therapy (PDT) to prepare light&#8208;boosted PTX nanoparticle (Ce6/PTX  2  &#8208;Azo NP) by encapsulation PTX  2  &#8208;Azo into photosensitizer chlorine (Ce6) decorated peptide copolymer. In this nanoparticle, PTX  2  &#8208;Azo prevents unexpected premature drug leakage and realizes specific release in hypoxic tumor microenvironment and photosensitizer Ce6 not only efficiently generates singlet oxygen under light irradiation but also acts as a positive amplifier to promote the release of PTX. Moreover, chemotherapy compensates the deficiency of PDT as well. Such combination of PDT and chemotherapy displays excellent antitumor efficacy.

      <title>Colyliform Crystalline 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks with Quasi&#8208;3D Topologies for Rapid I2 Adsorption</title>
      <dc:description>Constructing three&#8208;dimensional (3D) structural characteristics on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is a smart approach to effectively improve the pore permeability and mass transfer rate of the materials and realize the rapid adsorption for guest molecules, while avoiding the high cost and monomer scarcity in preparing 3D COFs. Herein, we report for the first time a series of colyliform crystalline 2D COFs with quasi&#8208;three&#8208;dimensional (Q&#8208;3D) topologies, consisting of unique &#8220;stereoscopic&#8221; triangular pores, large interlayer spacings and flexible constitutional units which makes the pores elastic and self&#8208;adaptable for the object transmission. The as&#8208;prepared QTD&#8208;COFs have fairly faster adsorption rate (2.51 g/h) for iodine than traditional 2D COFs, with an unprecedented maximum adsorption capacity of 6.29 g/g. The excellent adsorption performance, as well as the prominent irradiation stability enable the QTD&#8208;COFs to be reliably applied to the rapid removal of radioactive iodine under special circumstances of emergency response to nuclear accidents.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Constructing three&#8208;dimensional (3D) structural characteristics on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is a smart approach to effectively improve the pore permeability and mass transfer rate of the materials and realize the rapid adsorption for guest molecules, while avoiding the high cost and monomer scarcity in preparing 3D COFs. Herein, we report for the first time a series of colyliform crystalline 2D COFs with quasi&#8208;three&#8208;dimensional (Q&#8208;3D) topologies, consisting of unique &#8220;stereoscopic&#8221; triangular pores, large interlayer spacings and flexible constitutional units which makes the pores elastic and self&#8208;adaptable for the object transmission. The as&#8208;prepared QTD&#8208;COFs have fairly faster adsorption rate (2.51 g/h) for iodine than traditional 2D COFs, with an unprecedented maximum adsorption capacity of 6.29 g/g. The excellent adsorption performance, as well as the prominent irradiation stability enable the QTD&#8208;COFs to be reliably applied to the rapid removal of radioactive iodine under special circumstances of emergency response to nuclear accidents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Collective Total Syntheses of Aspidofractinine Alkaloids via Development of a Bischler&#8208;Napieralski/Semipinacol Rearrangement Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>A tandem Bischler&#8208;Napieralski/semipinacol rearrangement reaction has been developed for the purpose of assembling spiro dicyclic indole framework, a privileged structural unit of aspidofractinine type monoterpenoid indole alkaloids. In combination with a sequential Mannich reaction, the contracted central bridge ring system (bicyclic[2.2.1]heptane) of these molecules with contiguous quaternary centers could be expeditiously constructed. Development of this novel strategy finally culminated in the collective total syntheses of four aspidofractinine alkaloids.</dc:description>

      <title>Unravelling structural dynamics within a photoswitchable single&#8208;peptide: A step towards multi&#8208;modal bio&#8208;inspired nanodevices</title>

      <dc:description>To develop high&#8208;performance nonlinear optical (NLO) materials for infrared (IR) applications, we have applied a rational element&#8208;composition design strategy and investigated the unexplored PbO&#8211;PbCl 2  &#8211;PbI 2  system.

      <title>Photoredox Catalysis Unlocks the Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cyanation of Aryl Halides under Benign Conditions</title>
      <dc:description>The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cyanations of aryl halides are among the most used methods for synthesizing aryl nitriles. Despite tremendous advances, cyanating an aryl halide in a facile and benign fashion has generally been unsuccessful. The challenge for this significant transformation is the strong affinity of cyanide for metal centers, which makes organometallic catalysis elusive by hampering oxidative addition and reductive elimination. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that nickel&#8208;catalyzed cyanations of aryl halides are readily enabled by visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis, in which Ni(II) species are transiently oxidized to Ni(III) species, thereby facilitating the subsequent cyanide transfer and reductive elimination. Using this dual catalysis strategy, we cyanated aryl and alkenyl halides at room temperature in a highly benign manner (30 examples, 53&#8208;93% yields) by avoiding the use of air&#8208;sensitive ligands, Ni(0) processors, and hypertoxic cyanation reagents, while also not generating excess metal waste. Computational studies were also used to help understand the present transformation.</dc:description>
