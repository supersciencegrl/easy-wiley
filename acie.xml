      <title>How local structural modulations in zeolite crystals have been studied by Electron Microscopy</title>
      <dc:description>Zeolites are widely used in catalysis, gas separation, ion exchange, etc. due to their superior physicochemical properties, which are closely related to&#160;specific features of&#160;their framework structures. Although more than two hundred different framework types have been recognized through the years, it is of great interest to explore from a crystallographic perspective, the atomic positions, surface terminations, pore connectivity and structural defects that deviate from the ideal framework structures, namely local structural modulation. In this article, we review different types of local modulations in zeolite frameworks using various techniques, especially electron microscopy (EM). The most recent advances in resolving structural information at the atomic level with aberration corrected EM are also presented, commencing a new era to gain atomic structural information, not only for all tetrahedral atoms including point vacancies in framework but also for extra&#8208;framework cations and surface terminations.</dc:description>

      <title>Fast and long&#8208;lasting Fe(&#8546;) reduction by boron toward green and accelerated Fenton chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>Generation of hydroxyl radicals in the Fenton system (Fe(II)/H  2  O  2  ) is seriously limited by the sluggish kinetics of Fe(III) reduction and fast Fe(III) precipitation. For the first time, we discover that boron crystals (C&#8208;Boron) remarkably accelerate the Fe(III)/Fe(II) circulation in Fenton&#8208;like systems (C&#8208;Boron/Fe(III)/H  2  O  2  ) to produce a myriad of hydroxyl radicals with excellent efficiencies in oxidative degradation of various pollutants. The surface B&#8208;B bonds and interfacial suboxide boron in the surface B  12  icosahedra are the active sites to donate electrons to promote fast Fe(III) reduction to Fe(II) and further enhance hydroxyl radical production via the Fenton chemistry. The C&#8208;Boron/Fe(III)/H  2  O  2  system outperforms the benchmark Fenton (Fe(II)/H  2  O  2  ) and Fe(III)&#8208;based sulfate radical systems. The reactivity and stability of crystalline boron is much higher than the popular molecular reducing agents, nanocarbons, and other metal/metal&#8208;free nanomaterials. Therefore, the discovery opens up a new avenue to leveraging metal&#8208;free boron for green oxidation and fast environmental decontamination.</dc:description>

      <title>Surface oxide&#8208;rich activation layer (SOAL) on Ni2Mo3N for rapid and durable oxygen evolution reaction</title>
      <dc:description>The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is key to renewable energy technologies such as water electrolysis and metal&#8208;air batteries. However, the multiple steps associated with proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer result in sluggish OER kinetics and catalysts are required. Here we demonstrate that a novel nitride, Ni2Mo3N, is a highly active OER catalyst that outperforms the benchmark material RuO2  . Ni2Mo3N exhibits a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2  at a nominal overpotential of 270 mV in 0.1 M KOH with outstanding catalytic cyclability and durability. Structural characterization and computational studies reveal that the excellent activity stems from formation of a surface oxide&#8208;rich activation layer (SOAL). Secondary Mo atoms on the surface act as electron pumps that stabilize oxygen&#8208;containing species and facilitate continuity of the reactions. This discovery will stimulate further development of ternary nitrides with oxide surface layers as efficient OER catalysts for electrochemical energy devices.</dc:description>

      <title>Templated&#8208;assembly of CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals into 2D photonic supercrystals with amplified spontaneous emission</title>
      <dc:description>Perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) have revolutionized optoelectronic devices because of their versatile optical properties. However, controlling and extending these functionalities often requires a light management strategy involving additional processing steps. Here, we introduce a simple approach to shape perovskite nanocrystals (NC) into photonic architectures that provide light management by directly shaping the active material. Pre&#8208;patterned polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) templates are used for the template&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly of 10 nm CsPbBr  3  perovskite NC colloids into large area (1 cm  2  ) 2D photonic crystals with tunable lattice spacing, ranging from 400 nm up to several microns. The photonic crystal arrangement facilitates efficient light coupling to the nanocrystal layer, thereby increasing the electric field intensity within the perovskite film. As a result, CsPbBr  3  2D photonic crystals show amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) under lower optical excitation fluences in the near&#8208;IR, in contrast to equivalent flat NC films prepared using the same colloidal ink. This is attributed to the enhanced multi&#8208;photon absorption caused by light trapping in the photonic crystal.</dc:description>

      <title>&#963;&#8208;Aromaticity&#8208;Induced Stabilization of Heterometallic Supertetrahedral Clusters [Zn6Ge16]4&#8211;&#160;and [Cd6Ge16]4&#8211;</title>
      <dc:description>In this work, the largest heterometallic supertetrahedral clusters, [Zn6Ge16]4&#8211; and [Cd6Ge16]4&#8211;, were directly self&#8208;assembled through highly&#8208;charged [Ge4]4&#8211; units and transition metal cations, in which 3&#8208;center&#8208;2&#8208;electron &#963; bonding in Ge2Zn or Ge2Cd triangles plays a vital role in the stabilization of the whole structure. The cluster structures have an open framework with a large central cavity of diameter 4.6 &#197; for Zn and 5.0 &#197; for Cd, respectively. Time&#8208;dependent HRESI&#8208;MS spectra show that the larger clusters grow from smaller components with a single [Ge4]4&#8211; and ZnMes2 units. Calculations performed at the DFT level indicate a very large HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap in [M6Ge16]4&#8211; (2.22 eV), suggesting high kinetic stability that may offer opportunities in materials science. These observations offer a new strategy for the assembly of heterometallic clusters with high symmetry.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this work, the largest heterometallic supertetrahedral clusters, [Zn6Ge16]4&#8211; and [Cd6Ge16]4&#8211;, were directly self&#8208;assembled through highly&#8208;charged [Ge4]4&#8211; units and transition metal cations, in which 3&#8208;center&#8208;2&#8208;electron &#963; bonding in Ge2Zn or Ge2Cd triangles plays a vital role in the stabilization of the whole structure. The cluster structures have an open framework with a large central cavity of diameter 4.6 &#197; for Zn and 5.0 &#197; for Cd, respectively. Time&#8208;dependent HRESI&#8208;MS spectra show that the larger clusters grow from smaller components with a single [Ge4]4&#8211; and ZnMes2 units. Calculations performed at the DFT level indicate a very large HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap in [M6Ge16]4&#8211; (2.22 eV), suggesting high kinetic stability that may offer opportunities in materials science. These observations offer a new strategy for the assembly of heterometallic clusters with high symmetry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Pseudo&#8208;membrane jackets: Two&#8208;dimensional coordination polymers achieving visible phase separation in cell membrane</title>
      <dc:description>Cell membranes contain lateral systems that consist of various lipid compositions and actin cytoskeleton, providing two&#8208;dimensional (2D) platforms for chemical reactions. However, such complex 2D environments have not yet been used as a synthetic platform for artificial 2D nanomaterials. Herein, we demonstrate the direct synthesis of 2D coordination polymers (CPs) at the liquid&#8722;cell interface of the plasma membrane of living cells. The coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of networking metal complex lipids produces cyanide&#8208;bridged CP layers with metal ions, enabling &#8216;pseudo&#8208;membrane jackets&#8217; that produce long&#8208;lived micro&#8208;domains with a size of 1&#8211;5 &#956;m. The resultant artificial and visible phase separation systems remain stable even in the absence of actin skeletons in cells. Moreover, the jackets achieved the enhancement of cellular calcium response to ATP. This confirms that the artificial nanomaterials formed via moderate coordinative intermolecular interactions create a 2D scaffold on complex cell membrane environments, thereby providing a unique tool for the chemical control of cell functions.</dc:description>

      <title>Atomic Layer Deposition of Cobalt Phosphide for Efficient Water Splitting</title>
      <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal phosphides (TMP) prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD) is reported for the first time.

      <title>A Self&#8208;Consistent Model for Sorption and Transport in Polyimide&#8208;Derived Carbon Molecular Sieve Gas Separation Membranes</title>
      <dc:description>Demand for energy&#8208;efficient gas separations exists across many industrial processes, and membranes can aid in meeting this demand. Carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes show exceptional separation performance and scalable processing attributes attractive for important, similar&#8208;sized gas pairs.

This framework shares features with dual&#8208;mode transport theory for glassy polymers; however, physical connections to CMS model parameters differ from glassy polymer cases. We present evidence in CMS membranes for a large volume fraction of microporous domains characterized by Langmuir sorption in local equilibrium with a minority continuous phase described by Henry&#8217;s law sorption. Using this framework, expressions are provided to relate measurable parameters for sorption and transport in CMS materials.

      <title>Tighter Confinement Increases Selectivity of&#160;D&#8208;Glucose Isomerization Toward&#160;L&#8208;Sorbose in Titanium Zeolites</title>
      <dc:description>Aqueous&#8208;phase isomerization of D&#8208;glucose to D&#8208;fructose and L&#8208;sorbose are catalyzed in parallel by Lewis acidic Ti sites in siliceous frameworks. Glucose isomerization rates (per Ti, 373 K) are undetectable when Ti sites are confined within mesoporous voids (Ti&#8208;MCM&#8208;41, TiO2  &#8208;SiO2) and increase to detectable values when Ti sites are confined within the smaller twelve&#8208;membered ring (12&#8208;MR) micropores of Ti&#8208;Beta. Isomerization rates decrease to lower values (by ~20&#215;) with further decreases in micropore size as Ti sites are confined within 10&#8208;MR pores (Ti&#8208;MFI, Ti&#8208;CON), likely because of intrapore reactant diffusion restrictions, and reach undetectable values within the 8&#8208;MR pores of Ti&#8208;CHA as size exclusion prevents glucose from accessing active sites. Remarkably, the selectivity toward L&#8208;sorbose over D&#8208;fructose increases systematically as spatial constraints around Ti sites become tighter, and is &gt;10 on Ti&#8208;MFI. These findings demonstrate the marked influence of confinement around Ti active sites on the selectivity between parallel stereoselective sugar isomerization pathways.</dc:description>

      <title>Photo&#8208;excited oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions enabling a high&#8208;performance Zn&#8208;air battery</title>
      <dc:description>Harvesting solar energy in battery systems is pivotal for a sustainable society and faced with challenges. Herein, a photo&#8208;involved Zn&#8208;air battery is constructed with two cathodes of poly(1,4&#8208;di(2&#8208;thienyl))benzene (PDTB) and TiO  2&#160;  grown on carbon papers to sandwich a Zn anode. The PDTB cathode is illuminated in a discharging process, where photoelectrons are excited into the conduction band of PDTB to promote oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and raise the output voltage. In a reverse process, holes in the valence band of the illuminated TiO  2  cathode are driven for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by an applied voltage. A record&#8208;high discharge voltage of 1.90 V and an unprecedented low charge voltage of 0.59 V are achieved in the photo&#8208;involved Zn&#8208;air battery, regardless of the equilibrium voltage. This work offers an innovative pathway for photo&#8208;energy utilization in rechargeable batteries.</dc:description>

      <title>Spatial and Kinetic Regulation of Sulfur Electrochemistry on Semi&#8208;Immobilized Redox Mediators in Working Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>The adoption of redox mediators (RMs) is regarded as an effective strategy to enhance reaction kinetics of multi&#8208;electron sulfur electrochemistry. However, the soluble small&#8208;molecule RMs usually aggravate the internal shuttle and thus further reduce the battery efficiency and cyclability. In this contribution, a semi&#8208;immobilization strategy is proposed for RM design to effectively regulate the sulfur electrochemistry while circumvent the inherent shuttle issue in a working battery. Small imide molecules as the model RMs were co&#8208;polymerized with moderate&#8208;chained polyether, rendering a semi&#8208;immobilized RM (PIPE) that is spatially restrained yet kinetically active. A small amount of PIPE (5% in cathode) extended the cyclability of sulfur cathode from 37 to 190 cycles with 80% capacity retention at 0.5 C. The semi&#8208;immobilization strategy not only fills up the understanding of RM&#8208;assisted sulfur electrochemistry in alkali metal batteries, but also enlightens the chemical design of active additives for advanced electrochemical energy storage devices.</dc:description>

The inversion of the polarity of the pyridinium N&#8211;N ylides by single&#8208;electron oxidation successfully enables radical&#8208;mediated 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions with enolsilanes formed in situ from ketones, followed by homolytic cleavage of the N&#8211;N bond.

      <title>Ultrafast Encapsulation of Metal Nanoclusters into MFI Zeolite in the Course of Its Crystallization: Catalytic Application for Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
      <dc:description>Encapsulating metal nanoclusters into zeolites enables a synergistic effect that combines superior catalytic activity of the nanoclusters with high stability and unique shape selectivity of the crystalline microporous materials. The preparation of such bifunctional catalysts, however, is often restricted by the mismatching in time scale between the fast formation of nanoclusters and the slow crystallization of zeolites. We herein demonstrate a novel strategy toward overcoming the mismatching issue, in which the crystallization of zeolites is expedited so as to synchronize with the rapid formation of nanoclusters. Such concept was proven by confining Pt and Sn nanoclusters into a ZSM&#8208;5 (MFI) zeolite in the course of its crystallization, leading to an ultrafast,  in situ  encapsulation within just 5 min. The Pt/Sn&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 exhibited exceptional activity and selectivity with stability in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, which further verified the successful encapsulation of metal clusters in zeolite. This method of ultrafast encapsulation opens up a new avenue for designing and synthesizing composite zeolitic materials with structural and compositional complexity.</dc:description>

      <title>Cryogenic OrbiSIMS Localizes Semi&#8208;Volatile Molecules in Biological Tissues</title>
      <dc:description>OrbiSIMS is a recently developed instrument for label&#8208;free imaging of chemicals with micron spatial resolution and high mass resolution. We report a cryogenic workflow for OrbiSIMS (Cryo&#8208;OrbiSIMS) that improves chemical detection of lipids and other biomolecules in tissues. Cryo&#8208;OrbiSIMS boosts ionization yield and decreases ion&#8208;beam induced fragmentation, greatly improving the detection of biomolecules such as triacylglycerides. It also increases chemical coverage to include molecules with intermediate or high vapor pressures, such as free fatty acids and semi&#8208;volatile organic compounds (SVOCs). We find that Cryo&#8208;OrbiSIMS reveals the hitherto unknown localization patterns of SVOCs with high spatial and chemical resolution in diverse plant, animal and human tissues. We also show that Cryo&#8208;OrbiSIMS can be combined with genetic analysis to identify enzymes regulating SVOC metabolism. Cryo&#8208;OrbiSIMS is applicable to high resolution imaging of a wide variety of non&#8208;volatile and semi&#8208;volatile molecules across many areas of biomedicine.</dc:description>

      <title>Micro&#8208;Lensed Fiber Laser Desorption Mass Spectrometry Imaging Reveals Subcellular Distribution of Drugs within Single Cells</title>
      <dc:description>The visualization of temporal and spatial changes in the intracellular environment has great significance for chemistry and bioscience research. Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is playing an increasingly important role in this field because of its unique advantages, such as being label&#8208;free and high throughput, yet it remains a great challenge for laser&#8208;based techniques due to limited lateral resolution. Here, we develop a simple, reliable and economic nanoscale MSI approach by introducing desorption laser with a micro&#8208;lensed fiber. Using this integrated platform, we achieved 300 nm resolution MSI and successfully visualized the distribution of various small&#8208;molecule drugs in subcellular locations. Moreover, exhaustive dynamic processes of anticancer drugs, including releasing from nanoparticle carriers entering nucleus of cells, can be readily acquired on an organelle scale. Considering the simplicity and universality of this nanoscale desorption device, it could be easily adapted to most of laser&#8208;based mass spectrometry applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Methanol assisted autocatalysis in catalytic methanol synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Catalytic methanol synthesis is one of the major processes in the chemical industry and may grow in importance, as methanol produced from CO2 and sustainably derived H2 is envisioned to play an important role as energy carrier in a future low CO2 emission society. However, despite the widespread use, the reaction mechanism and the nature of the active sites are not fully understood. Here we report that methanol synthesis at commercially applied conditions using the industrial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst is dominated by a methanol&#8208;assisted, autocatalytic reaction mechanism. We propose that the presence of methanol opens for hydrogenation of surface formate via methyl formate. Autocatalytic acceleration of the reaction is also observed for Cu supported on SiO2 although with low absolute activity, but not for Cu/Al2O3 catalysts. The results illustrate an important example of autocatalysis in heterogeneous catalysis and pave the way for further understanding, improvements and process optimization of industrial methanol synthesis.</dc:description>

      <title>A Short&#8208;Lived but Highly Cytotoxic Vanadium(V) Complex as a Potential Drug Lead for Brain Cancer Treatment by Intratumoral Injections</title>
      <dc:description>Despite the clinical success of Pt anti&#8208;cancer drugs, metal&#8208;based drugs are slow to enter the clinic, due to their coordination chemistry and typically short lifetimes in biological environments.

Complex 1 was 12&#8208;fold more toxic than cisplatin in T98g cells, and 6&#8208;fold more toxic in T98g cells than in a non&#8208;cancer human cell line, HFF&#8208;1. Its high toxicity in T98g cells was retained in the presence of physiological concentrations of the two main metal&#8208;binding serum proteins, albumin and transferrin. These properties favour further development of 1 for brain cancer treatment by intratumoral injections.</dc:description>

      <title>Diradical organic one&#8208;dimensional polymers synthesized on a metallic surface</title>
      <dc:description>The synthesis of radical polymers with control over chemical composition and structure is a milestone in materials science and has re&#8208;emerged recently because of the development of new synthetic methods to produce stable radical organic compounds. However, their synthesis is remarkably challenging due to the inherent reactivity induced by the presence of unpaired electrons in their structure. Here, we report on the synthesis and characterization of atomically precise one&#8208;dimensional diradical peripentacene polymers on a Au(111) surface. By means of high&#8208;resolution scanning probe microscopy complemented by theoretical simulations, we provide an evidence of their magnetic properties, which arise from the presence of two unpaired spins at their termini. In addition, we probe a transition of their magnetic properties related to the length of the polymer. Peripentacene dimers exhibit an antiferromagnetic (S = 0) singlet ground state. They are characterized by singlet&#8208;triplet spin&#8208;flip inelastic excitations with an effective exchange coupling (J  eff  ) of 2.5 meV, whereas trimers and longer peripentacene polymers reveal a paramagnetic nature and feature Kondo fingerprints at each terminus due to the unpaired spin. Our work provides access to the precise fabrication of polymers featuring diradical character and potentially useful in carbon&#8208;based optoelectronics and spintronics.</dc:description>

By means of high&#8208;resolution scanning probe microscopy complemented by theoretical simulations, we provide an evidence of their magnetic properties, which arise from the presence of two unpaired spins at their termini. In addition, we probe a transition of their magnetic properties related to the length of the polymer. Peripentacene dimers exhibit an antiferromagnetic (S = 0) singlet ground state. They are characterized by singlet&#8208;triplet spin&#8208;flip inelastic excitations with an effective exchange coupling (J  eff  ) of 2.5 meV, whereas trimers and longer peripentacene polymers reveal a paramagnetic nature and feature Kondo fingerprints at each terminus due to the unpaired spin. Our work provides access to the precise fabrication of polymers featuring diradical character and potentially useful in carbon&#8208;based optoelectronics and spintronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>NIR&#8208;II Chemiluminescence Molecular Sensor for In&#8208;Vivo High Contrast Inflammation Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>Chemiluminescence (CL) sensing without the external excitation ligh  t and autofluorescence interference has been applied to high&#8208;contrast  in vitro  immunoassays and  in vivo  inflammation and tumor microenvironment detection. However, conventional CL sensing usually operates in the range of 400&#8208;850 nm, which limits the high&#8208;performance of  in vivo  imaging due to the serious light scattering effect and signals attenuation in tissue. To address this challenge,  here we present a new type of  CL sensor in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II CLS) with deep penetration depth (~ 8 mm) by employing successive CL resonance energy transfer (CRET) and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the activated CL substrate to two rationally designed donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor fluorophores BTD540 and BBTD700. NIR&#8208;II CLS can be selectively activated by hydrogen peroxide over other reactive oxygen species (ROSs). Moreover, NIR&#8208;II CLS is capable of detecting local inflammation in mice with 4.5&#8208;fold higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) than that under NIR&#8208;II fluorescence modality.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The stereospecific 1,2&#8208;migration of boronate complexes is one of the most representative reactions in boron chemistry. This process has been used extensively to develop powerful methods for asymmetric synthesis, with applications spanning from pharmaceuticals to natural products. Typically, 1,2&#8208;migration of boronate complexes is driven by displacement of an  &#945;  &#8208;leaving group, oxidation of an  &#945;  &#8208;boryl radical, or electrophilic activation of an alkenyl boronate complex. The aim of this article is to summarize the recent advances in the rapidly expanding field of electrophile&#8208;induced stereospecific 1,2&#8208;migration of groups from boron to  sp  2  and  sp  3  carbon centers. It will be shown that three different conceptual approaches can be utilized to enable the 1,2&#8208;migration of boronate complexes: stereospecific Zweifel&#8208;type reactions, catalytic conjunctive coupling reactions, and transition metal&#8208;free  sp  2  &#8208;  sp  3  couplings.

      <title>In Situ Dispersion of Pd on TiO2 During Reverse Water&#8208;Gas Shift Reaction: Formation of Atomically Dispersed Pd</title>
      <dc:description>Expanding the application scope of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) to high&#8208;temperature hydrogenation requires materials that thermodynamically favor metal atom isolation over cluster formation under these conditions. Here, we show that Pd can be predominantly dispersed as isolated atoms onto TiO  2  during the reverse water&#8208;gas shift (rWGS) reaction at 400 &#176;C. Achieving atomic dispersion requires an artificial increase of the absolute TiO  2  surface area by an order of magnitude and can be accomplished by physically mixing a precatalyst (Pd/TiO  2  ) with neat TiO  2  prior to the rWGS reaction. The  in situ  dispersion of Pd was reflected through a continuous increase of rWGS activity over 92 h and supported by kinetic analysis, infrared spectroscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. The thermodynamic stability of Pd under high&#8208;temperature rWGS conditions is associated with Pd&#8208;Ti coordination (enthalpic stabilization), which seemingly manifests upon O&#8208;vacancy formation, and the artificial increase in TiO  2  surface area (entropic stabilization). In addition to this, steady&#8208;state isotopic transient kinetic analysis suggests an upper limit of two for the number of oxide&#8208;supported atoms required to catalyze the WGS reaction. Our approach to noble metal SACs synthesis can be generally applied and provides a platform to study the reactivity of heterolytically&#8208;activated hydrogen toward unsaturated functional groups.</dc:description>

Our findings demonstrate strong chiral recognition and a significant ensemble effect in the PdGa system, hence highlighting the huge potential of chiral intermetallic compounds for enantioselective synthesis and underlining the importance to control the catalytically active sites at the atomic level.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Elucidating the effects of crystallization induced blue shift emission of a newly synthesized di&#8208;boron complex (DBC) by enhanced photoluminescence (PL) and electrochemiluminescence (ECL) in the annihilation pathway was realized for the first time. The 57 nm blue&#8208;shift and great enhancement in the crystalline lattice relative to the DBC solution were attributed to the restriction of intramolecular rotation (RIR) and confirmed by PL imaging, x&#8208;ray diffraction, as well as DFT calculations. It was discovered that ECL at crystalline film/solution interfaces can be further enhanced by means of both coreactant route and RIR. The RIR contributions with coreactant increased ECL up to 5 times more. Very interestingly, the coreactant system was found to give off a redshifted light emission. Mechanistic studies reveal that a difference between location of the ECL in the coreactant route and that in the annihilation pathway leads to an alternative emission wavelength.</dc:description>

      <title>Hollow Carbon Sphere Nanoreactors Loaded with PdCu Nanoparticles: Void&#8208;Confinement Effects in Liquid&#8208;Phase Hydrogenations</title>
      <dc:description>Nanoreactors with hollow structures have attracted great interest in catalysis research due to their void&#8208;confinement effects. However, the challenge in unambiguously unraveling these confinement effects is to decouple them from other factors affecting the catalytic behaviors. Here, we synthesize a pair of hollow carbon sphere (HCS) nanoreactors with pre&#8208;synthesized PdCu nanoparticles encapsulated inside of HCS (PdCu@HCS) and supported outside of HCS (PdCu/HCS), respectively, while keeping other structural features the same. Based on the two comparative nanoreactors, void&#8208;confinement effects in liquid&#8208;phase hydrogenation are investigated in a two&#8208;chamber reactor. It is found that hydrogenations over PdCu@HCS are shown as shape&#8208;selective catalysis, can be accelerated (accumulation of reactants), decelerated (mass transfer limitation) and even inhibited (molecular&#8208;sieving effect), respectively; conversion of the intermediate in the void space can be further promoted. Using this principle, a specific imine is selectively produced. This work provides proofs of concept for fundamental catalysis of the hollow nanoreactors.</dc:description>

Here, we synthesize a pair of hollow carbon sphere (HCS) nanoreactors with pre&#8208;synthesized PdCu nanoparticles encapsulated inside of HCS (PdCu@HCS) and supported outside of HCS (PdCu/HCS), respectively, while keeping other structural features the same. Based on the two comparative nanoreactors, void&#8208;confinement effects in liquid&#8208;phase hydrogenation are investigated in a two&#8208;chamber reactor. It is found that hydrogenations over PdCu@HCS are shown as shape&#8208;selective catalysis, can be accelerated (accumulation of reactants), decelerated (mass transfer limitation) and even inhibited (molecular&#8208;sieving effect), respectively; conversion of the intermediate in the void space can be further promoted. Using this principle, a specific imine is selectively produced. This work provides proofs of concept for fundamental catalysis of the hollow nanoreactors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Fluorogenic Probe Using a Mislow&#8208;Evans Rearrangement for Real&#8208;Time Imaging of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
      <dc:description>Hydrogen peroxide (H  2  O  2  ) mediates the biology of wound healing, apoptosis, inflammation, etc. H  2  O  2&#160;  has been fluorometrically imaged with protein&#8208; or small molecule&#8208;based probes. However, only protein&#8208;based probes have afforded temporal insights within seconds. Small molecule&#8208;based electrophilic probes for H  2  O  2  &#160;require many minutes for a sufficient response in biological systems. Here, we report a fluorogenic probe that selectively undergoes a [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement (seleno&#8208;Mislow&#8208;Evans rearrangement) with H  2  O  2  , followed by an acetal hydrolysis, to produce a green fluorescent molecule in seconds. Unlike other electrophilic probes, the current probe acts as a nucleophile. The fast kinetics enabled real&#8208;time imaging of H  2  O  2  &#160;produced in endothelial cells in 8 seconds (much earlier than previously shown) and H  2  O  2  &#160;in a zebrafish wound healing model. This work may provide a platform for endogenous H  2  O  2  &#160;detection in real time with chemical probes.</dc:description>

      <title>Pt and CuOx decorated TiO2 photocatalyst for oxidative coupling of methane to C2 hydrocarbons in a flow reactor</title>
      <dc:description>Oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) has been considered as one of the most promising and attractive catalytic technology to upgrade methane. However, C  2  products (C  2  H  6  /C  2  H  4  ) from conventional methane conversion have not yielded commercially due to the competition from overoxidation and carbon accumulation at high temperatures. Herein, we reported the co&#8208;deposition of Pt nanoparticles and CuO  x  clusters on TiO  2  (PC&#8208;50), and then used the photocatalyst to demonstrate the first successful case of photocatalytic OCM in a flow reactor operated at room temperature and under atmospheric pressure. The optimized Cu  0.1  Pt  0.5  /PC&#8208;50 sample showed a highest yield of C  2  product of 6.8 &#181;mol h  &#8208;1  , at the space velocity of 2400 h  &#8208;1  , two times higher than the sum of the activity of Pt/PC&#8208;50 (1.07 &#181;mol h  &#8208;1  ) and Cu/PC&#8208;50 (1.9 &#181;mol h  &#8208;1  ), and it might also be the highest among photocatalytic methane conversions reported so far under atmospheric pressure. A high selectivity of 60% to C  2  was also comparable to the benchmark work of conventional high temperature (&gt;943K) thermal catalysis. It is proposed that Pt functioned as an electron acceptor facilitating charge separation, while holes could transfer to CuO  x  avoiding deep dehydrogenation and overoxidation of C  2  products. This work provides a new revenue for photocatalytic methane upgrade.</dc:description>

In this work, we report the regioselective generation of single&#8208;site Ir atoms and their evolution into stabilized subnanometric Ir clusters in MWW zeolite, which are located at the 10MR window connecting the two neighboring 12MR supercages.

Herein, we discover a general one&#8208;step approach to fabricate supramolecular porous polyelectrolyte membranes (SPPMs) from a single poly(ionic liquid) (PIL).

      <title>Anchoring supramolecular polymers to human red blood cells by combining dynamic covalent and non&#8208;covalent chemistries</title>

      <title>Simulation vs. Understanding: A Tension, in Quantum Chemistry and Beyond. Part C. Toward Consilience</title>
      <dc:description>
In the last part of our Essay, we outline a path of consilience, with a role both for simulation and for understanding. Experiment draws us together. Two case studies show what brings joy, and make it clear that how intertwined computation and theory&#8208;building has been for the authors. In the conjoined future we imagine (far out for some) chemistry's streak of creation provides a link to Art, and a passage to a renewed vision of the sacred in science.







Abstract
In the last part of our Essay, we outline a future of consilience, with a role both for fact&#8208;seekers, and for searchers for understanding. We begin by looking at theory and simulation, surrounded as they are by and interacting with experiment, especially in Chemistry. Experimenters ask questions both conceptual and numerical, and so draw the communities together. Two case studies show what brings the theoretician authors joy in this playground, and two more detailed ones make it clear that computation/simulation is anyway deeply intertwined with theory&#8208;building in what we do, or for that matter, anywhere in the profession. From a definition of science we try to foresee how simulation and theory will interact in the AI&#8208;dominated future. We posit that Chemistry's streak of creation provides in that conjoined future a link to Art, and a passage to a renewed vision of the sacred in science.

      <title>Keteniminium&#8208;Driven Umpolung Difunctionalization of Ynamides</title>
      <dc:description>
Trapped: A nondirected keteniminium&#8208;driven multicomponent 1,2&#8208;umpolung difunctionalization of ynamides with aryl diazonium salts and aryl boronic acids under Pd catalysis for the synthesis of triaryl&#8208;substituted enamides is showcased for the first time. This transformation proceeds by 1,3&#8208;migration of an electrophile from in situ generated keteniminium species to the electrophilic &#945;&#8208;position of the ynamide, followed by trapping of nucleophilic &#946;&#8208;vinylic metal species with a nucleophile.







Abstract
A three&#8208;component Pd&#8208;catalyzed coupling of ynamides, aryl diazonium salts, and aryl boronic acids for the synthesis of novel triaryl&#8208;substituted enamides is described. This transformation represents the first example of an umpolung regioselective unsymmetrical syn&#8208;1,2&#8208;diarylation/aryl&#8208;olefination of ynamides. The aryl moieties of the diazonium salt (electrophile) and boronic acid (nucleophile) are explicitly incorporated in the electrophilic &#945;&#8208; and nucleophilic &#946;&#8208;position, respectively, of the ynamide, resulting in a single isomer of the N&#8208;bearing tetrasubstituted olefin. The scope is broad (68 examples), showing excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance. DFT calculations substantiate the rationale of the mechanistic cycle and the regioselectivity. The chemoselectivity and synthetic potential of the enamide products were also studied.

&lt;p&gt;A three&#8208;component Pd&#8208;catalyzed coupling of ynamides, aryl diazonium salts, and aryl boronic acids for the synthesis of novel triaryl&#8208;substituted enamides is described. This transformation represents the first example of an umpolung regioselective unsymmetrical &lt;i&gt;syn &lt;/i&gt;&#8208;1,2&#8208;diarylation/aryl&#8208;olefination of ynamides. The aryl moieties of the diazonium salt (electrophile) and boronic acid (nucleophile) are explicitly incorporated in the electrophilic &#945;&#8208; and nucleophilic &#946;&#8208;position, respectively, of the ynamide, resulting in a single isomer of the N&#8208;bearing tetrasubstituted olefin. The scope is broad (68 examples), showing excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance. DFT calculations substantiate the rationale of the mechanistic cycle and the regioselectivity. The chemoselectivity and synthetic potential of the enamide products were also studied.&lt;/p&gt;
