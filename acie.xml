      <title>Prospect of Sulfurized Pyrolyzed Poly(acrylonitrile) (S@pPAN) Cathode Materials for Rechargeable Lithium Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Attention S@pPAN: As the representative of molecular scale sulfur composite cathode, sulfurized pyrolyzed poly(acrylonitrile) (S@pPAN) has attracted great attention owing to its superior electrochemical behavior. It avoids polysulfides dissolving and provides an alternative solid&#8211;solid conversion (SSC) process. Several research directions are proposed to build better batteries based on the promising S@pPAN composite.







Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are one of the most promising next&#8208;generation batteries owing to their ultra&#8208;high theoretical energy density and that sulfur is an abundant resource. During the past 20&#8197;years, various sulfur materials have been reported. As a molecular&#8208;scale sulfur&#8208;composite cathode, sulfurized pyrolyzed poly(acrylonitrile) (S@pPAN) exhibits several competitive advantages in terms of its electrochemical behavior. Although it was first reported in 2002 S@pPAN is currently attracting increasing attention. In this Minireview, we summarize its molecular model and explore the correlation between its structure and its exceptional electrochemical performance. We classify the modification strategies into three types, including material improvement, binder, and electrolyte screening. Several research and development directions are also suggested.

      <title>Molecular Springs: Integration of Complex Dynamic Architectures into Functional Devices</title>
      <dc:description>
Spring fever: Supramolecular springs are defined as helical molecules or assemblies thereof in which the pitch can be modulated by external stimuli to achieve full control over the extension&#8211;contraction motion. In this Minireview, the structure&#8211;property relationships of supramolecular springs and spring&#8208;like materials triggered by external stimuli are highlighted for potential future applications in responsive macroscopic devices.







Abstract
Molecular/supramolecular springs are artificial nanoscale objects possessing well&#8208;defined structures and tunable physicochemical properties. Like a macroscopic spring, supramolecular springs are capable of switching their nanoscale conformation as a response to external stimuli by undergoing mechanical spring&#8208;like motions. This dynamic action offers intriguing opportunities for engineering molecular nanomachines by translating the stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoscopic motions into macroscopic work. These nanoscopic objects are reversible dynamic multifunctional architectures which can express a variety of novel properties and behave as adaptive nanoscopic systems. In this Minireview, we focus on the design and structure&#8211;property relationships of supramolecular springs and their (self&#8208;)assembly as a prerequisite towards the generation of novel dynamic materials featuring controlled movements to be readily integrated into macroscopic devices for applications in sensing, robotics, and the internet of things.

      <title>Bio&#8208;inspired Nonheme Iron Oxidation Catalysis: Involvement of Oxoiron(V) Oxidants in Cleaving Strong C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>
Iron&#8208;oxygen intermediates like iron(III)&#8208;hydroperoxo and high&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo species have been trapped and identified in investigations of bio&#8208;inspired catalytic nonheme iron systems, with the latter proposed to be the active oxidant for most of these systems. This Review highlights recent spectroscopic and mechanistic advances that have shed light on the pathways that can be accessed by these systems to form high&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo intermediates.







Abstract
Nonheme iron enzymes generate powerful and versatile oxidants that perform a wide range of oxidation reactions, including the functionalization of inert C&#8722;H bonds, which is a major challenge for chemists. The oxidative abilities of these enzymes have inspired bioinorganic chemists to design synthetic models to mimic their ability to perform some of the most difficult oxidation reactions and study the mechanisms of such transformations. Iron&#8208;oxygen intermediates like iron(III)&#8208;hydroperoxo and high&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo species have been trapped and identified in investigations of these bio&#8208;inspired catalytic systems, with the latter proposed to be the active oxidant for most of these systems. In this Review, we highlight the recent spectroscopic and mechanistic advances that have shed light on the various pathways that can be accessed by bio&#8208;inspired nonheme iron systems to form the high&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo intermediates.

      <title>Double Rotors with Fluxional Axles: Domino Rotation and Azide&#8208;Alkyne Huisgen Cycloaddition Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>The simple preparation of the multicomponent devices [Cu  4  (  A  )  2  ]  4+  and [Cu  2  (  A  )(  B  )]  2+  , both rotors with fluxional axles under&#173;going domino rotation, highlights the potential of self&#8208;sorting. The concept of domino rotation requires the interconversion of axle and rotator allowing the spatiotemporal decoupling of two degenerate exchange processes in [Cu  4  (  A  )  2  ]  4+  occurring at 142 kHz. Addition of two equiv. of  B  to rotor [Cu  4  (  A  )  2  ]  4+  afforded the heteromeric di&#8208;axle rotor [Cu  2  (  A  )(  B  )]  2+  with two distinct exchange processes (64.0 kHz and 0.55 Hz). The motion requiring a pyridine &#8594; zinc porphyrin bond cleavage is 1.2 &#215; 10  5  times faster than that operating via a terpyridine &#8594; [Cu(phenAr  2  )]  +  rupture.

      <title>In Situ Formation of Liquid Metals via Galvanic Replacement Reaction to Build Dendrite&#8208;Free Alkali Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Galvanic replacement reactions have been studied as a versatile route to synthesize nanostructured alloys. However, the galvanic replacement chemistry of alkali metals has rarely been explored. A protective interphase layer will be formed outside templates when the redox potential exceeds the potential windows of nonaqueous solutions, and the complex interfacial chemistry remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate the formation of room&#8208;temperature liquid metal alloys of Na and K via galvanic replacement reaction. The fundamentals of the reaction at such low potentials are investigated via a combined experimental and computational method, which uncovers the critical role of solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase in regulating the migration of Na ions and thus the alloying reaction kinetics. With in situ formed NaK liquid alloys as an anode, the dendritic growth of alkali metals can be eliminated thanks to the deformable and self&#8208;healing features of liquid metals. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept battery delivers reasonable electrochemical performance, confirming the generality of this in situ approach and design principle for next&#8208;generation dendrite&#8208;free batteries.</dc:description>

      <title>Intrinsic Electrocatalytic Activity Regulation of M&#8211;N&#8211;C Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Sustainable energy supply and sufficient chemical production are highly dependent on many essential catalytic processes for our sustainable society.

      <title>Phenotyping Reveals Targets of a Pseudo&#8208;Natural&#8208;Product Autophagy Inhibitor</title>
      <dc:description>
The Cinchona alkaloid scaffold was synthetically merged with the indole ring system, and the bioactivities of the products in phenotypic assays revealed a novel class of autophagy inhibitors, azaquindoles. Subsequent characterization of potent azaquindole&#8208;1 in the morphological cell painting assay guided target identification efforts. In contrast to the parent Cinchona alkaloids, azaquindoles selectively inhibit starvation&#8208; and rapamycin&#8208;induced autophagy by targeting the lipid kinase VPS34.







Abstract
Pseudo&#8208;natural&#8208;product (NP) design combines natural product fragments to provide unprecedented NP&#8208;inspired compounds not accessible by biosynthesis, but endowed with biological relevance. Since the bioactivity of pseudo&#8208;NPs may be unprecedented or unexpected, they are best evaluated in target agnostic cell&#8208;based assays monitoring entire cellular programs or complex phenotypes. Here, the Cinchona alkaloid scaffold was merged with the indole ring system to synthesize indocinchona alkaloids by Pd&#8208;catalyzed annulation. Exploration of indocinchona alkaloid bioactivities in phenotypic assays revealed a novel class of azaindole&#8208;containing autophagy inhibitors, the azaquindoles. Subsequent characterization of the most potent compound, azaquindole&#8208;1, in the morphological cell painting assay, guided target identification efforts. In contrast to the parent Cinchona alkaloids, azaquindoles selectively inhibit starvation&#8208; and rapamycin&#8208;induced autophagy by targeting the lipid kinase VPS34.

      <title>Salts of HCN&#8208;Cyanide Aggregates: [CN(HCN)2]&#8722; and [CN(HCN)3]&#8722;</title>
      <dc:description>
Flexible cyanides: Bulky cations and fast crystallization allowed the isolation and structurally characterization of examples of HCN&#8208;cyanide aggregates [CN(HCN)2)]&#8722; and [CN(HCN)3]&#8722; in the solid state. X&#8208;ray structure elucidation revealed hydrogen&#8208;bridged linear [CN(HCN)2]&#8722; and Y&#8208;shaped [CN(HCN)3]&#8722; molecular ions in the crystal.







Abstract
Although pure hydrogen cyanide can spontaneously polymerize or even explode, when initiated by small amounts of bases (e.g. CN&#8722;), the reaction of liquid HCN with [WCC]CN (WCC=weakly coordinating cation=Ph4P, Ph3PNPPh3=PNP) was investigated. Depending on the cation, it was possible to extract salts containing the formal dihydrogen tricyanide [CN(HCN)2]&#8722; and trihydrogen tetracyanide ions [CN(HCN)3]&#8722; from liquid HCN when a fast crystallization was carried out at low temperatures. X&#8208;ray structure elucidation revealed hydrogen&#8208;bridged linear [CN(HCN)2]&#8722; and Y&#8208;shaped [CN(HCN)3]&#8722; molecular ions in the crystal. Both anions can be considered members of highly labile cyanide&#8208;HCN solvates of the type [CN(HCN)n]&#8722; (n=1, 2, 3 &#8230;) as well as formal polypseudohalide ions.

      <title>Reductively Caged, Photoactivatable DNA&#8208;PAINT for High&#8208;throughput Super&#8208;resolution Microscopy</title>
      <dc:description>In DNA points accumulation in nanoscale topography (DNA&#8208;PAINT), capable of single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy with sub&#8208;10&#8208;nm resolution, the high background stemming from the unbound fluorescent probes in solution limits the imaging speed and throughput.&#160; Here, we reductively cage the fluorescent DNA probes conjugated with a cyanine dye to hydrocyanine, acting as a photoactivatable dark state. The additional dark state from caging lowered the fluorescent background while enabling optically selective activation by total internal reflection (TIR) illumination at 405 nm.&#160; These new benefits from &#8220;reductive caging&#8221; helped to increase the localization density or the imaging speed while preserving the image quality. With the aid of high&#8208;density analysis, we could further increase the imaging speed of conventional DNA&#8208;PAINT by two orders of magnitude, making DNA&#8208;PAINT capable of high&#8208;throughput super&#8208;resolution imaging.</dc:description>

The additional dark state from caging lowered the fluorescent background while enabling optically selective activation by total internal reflection (TIR) illumination at 405 nm.&#160; These new benefits from &#8220;reductive caging&#8221; helped to increase the localization density or the imaging speed while preserving the image quality. With the aid of high&#8208;density analysis, we could further increase the imaging speed of conventional DNA&#8208;PAINT by two orders of magnitude, making DNA&#8208;PAINT capable of high&#8208;throughput super&#8208;resolution imaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Isolation and Characterization of the Free Phenylphosphinidene Chalcogenides C6H5P=O and C6H5P=S, the Phosphorous Analogues of Nitrosobenzene and Thionitrosobenzene</title>

      <title>From Decades to Minutes: Steps Toward the Structure of Strychnine 1910&#8211;1948 and the Application of Today's Technology</title>
      <dc:description>
Strychnine was the last and greatest of natural products whose structure was determined using the classical methods. This 40&#8208;year story is told by following the trail of 20 key publications, mostly by Robert Robinson, leading up to his tentative, and ultimately R.&#8197;B. Woodward's, conclusive assignment. Modern quantum mechanical computations are used to select the actual strychnine structure from Robinson's many working hypotheses.







Abstract
Between 1910 and 1947, Robert Robinson (primarily), among others, published numerous proposed structures for strychnine. Robinson published 17 of his strychnine papers with his doctoral advisor William Henry Perkin,&#8197;Jr., though all but two appeared after Robinson had taken his first permanent academic position. This Essay analyzes 20 key publications leading up to Robinson's (correct, then incorrect, then correct again though not definitively) proposal and Woodward's assignment of the actual structure of strychnine. We subjected the assignment of the strychnine structure to a modern computational quantum chemistry workflow. By computing, with density functional theory, 1H and 13C&#8197;NMR chemical shifts for the literature&#8208;proposed strychnine structures, we were able to rule out most incorrect structures. 13C&#8197;NMR predictions were better at this, but 1H&#8197;NMR chemical shifts were helpful. A comparison is made between the consequences of publishing erroneous ideas in the first half of the 20th century and doing so in the 21st century.

      <title>An autonomous chemical robot discovers the rules of supramolecular chemistry without prior knowledge</title>
      <dc:description>We present a chemical discovery robot for the efficient and reliable discovery of supramolecular architectures through the exploration of a huge reaction space exceeding ten billion combinations. The system was designed to search for areas of reactivity found through autonomous selection of the reagent types, amounts, and reaction conditions aiming for combinations that are reactive. The process consists of two parts where reagents are mixed together, choosing from one type of aldehyde, one amine and one azide (from a possible family of two amines, two aldehydes and four azides) with different volumes, ratios, reaction times, and temperatures whereby the reagents are passed through a copper coil reactor under flow. Next, either cobalt or iron is added, again from a large number of possible quantities. The reactivity was determined by evaluating differences in pH, UV&#8208;vis, and mass spectra before and after the search was started.

      <title>Observation of the low frequency spectrum of water trimer as a sensitive test of the water trimer potential and the dipole moment surface</title>
      <dc:description>The intermolecular interaction of bulk water is dominated by pairwise and non&#8208;pairwise cooperative interactions, with the later accounting for ca. 25 % of the total Energy.
Whereas by now accurate descriptions of the pairwise interaction are available, which can be tested by precise low frequency spectra of water dimer over the entire range up to 550 cm  &#8211;1  , the same does not hold for the three&#8208;body interactions. Here, we report the first comprehensive spectrum of the water trimer in the frequency region from 70 to 620 cm  &#8211;1  , using our helium nanodroplet isolation setup at the free&#8208;electron lasers FELIX in Nijmegen. By comparison to accompanying high level quantum calcualtions, we are able to assign the experimentally observed intermolecular bands. The transition frequencies of the degenerate translation, the degenerate in&#8208;plane, the non&#8208;degenerate out&#8208;of&#8208;plane libration as well as additional bands of the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane librational mode are reported for the first time. These provide a benchmark for state&#8208;of&#8208;the art water potentials and dipole moment surfaces, especially in respect to the three&#8208;body interaction. Furthermore, we are able to deduce the size of the torsional splitting in the excited intermolecular modes, which increase upon vibrational excitation.</dc:description>

Here, we report the first comprehensive spectrum of the water trimer in the frequency region from 70 to 620 cm  &#8211;1  , using our helium nanodroplet isolation setup at the free&#8208;electron lasers FELIX in Nijmegen. By comparison to accompanying high level quantum calcualtions, we are able to assign the experimentally observed intermolecular bands. The transition frequencies of the degenerate translation, the degenerate in&#8208;plane, the non&#8208;degenerate out&#8208;of&#8208;plane libration as well as additional bands of the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane librational mode are reported for the first time. These provide a benchmark for state&#8208;of&#8208;the art water potentials and dipole moment surfaces, especially in respect to the three&#8208;body interaction. Furthermore, we are able to deduce the size of the torsional splitting in the excited intermolecular modes, which increase upon vibrational excitation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>In situ synthesis of aptamer&#8208;based polyvalent antibody mimic on the cell surface for enhanced immune&#8208;cancer cell interactions</title>
      <dc:description>An ability to promote therapeutic immune cells to recognize cancer cells is important for the success of cell&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy. We present a synthetic method for functionalizing the surface of natural killer (NK) cells with a supramolecular aptamer&#8208;based polyvalent antibody mimic (PAM). PAM is synthesized on the cell surface through nucleic acid assembly and hybridization. The data show that PAM has superiority over its monovalent counterpart in powering NKs for binding to cancer cells, and that PAM&#8208;engineered NK cells exhibit the capability of killing cancer cells more effectively. Notably, aptamers can in principle be discovered against any cell receptors; moreover, aptamers can be replaced with any other ligands to develop PAM. Thus, this work has successfully demonstrated a technology platform for promoting immune&#8208;cancer cell interactions.</dc:description>

In this, a mixture of the individual metal oxides and graphite is deoxidised in a melt of CaCl  2  at a temperature of only 1173 K. The (TiNbTaZrHf)C prepared is single&#8208;phase fcc and has a powdery morphology with a particle size range of 15&#8208;80 nm. Such materials are in demand for modern additive manufacturing techniques while preliminary tests have also indicated a possible application in supercapacitors.

      <title>Information Coding in Reconfigurable DNA Origami Domino Array</title>
      <dc:description>DNA nanostructures with programmable nanoscale patterns has been achieved in the past decades, and molecular information coding (MIC) on those designed nanostructures has gained increasing attention for information security. However, exerting steganography and cryptography synchronously on DNA nanostructures still remains a challenge to guarantee more security approach for MIC. Here, we demonstrated MIC in a reconfigurable DNA origami domino array (DODA), which can reconfigure intrinsic patterns but keep the DODA outline the same for steganography.

      <title>The First Chiral Thermochromic Ferroelastic with Seven Physical Channel Switches</title>
      <dc:description>Switchable materials play an invaluable role in signal processing and encryption of smart devices. The development of multifunctional materials that exhibit switching characteristics in multiple physical channels has attracted widespread attention. Here, two chiral thermochromic ferroelastic crystals (  S  &#8208;CTA)  2  CuCl  4  and (  R  &#8208;CTA)  2  CuCl  4  (CTA = 3&#8208;Chloro&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxypropyltrimethylammonium) have been prepared with switchable properties in dielectricity, conductivity, second harmonic generation (SHG), piezoelectricity, ferroelasticity, chiral and thermochromic properties. Compared with traditional phase transition materials with switching feature, thermochromism brings additional spectral encryption possibilities for future information processing.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Switchable materials play an invaluable role in signal processing and encryption of smart devices. The development of multifunctional materials that exhibit switching characteristics in multiple physical channels has attracted widespread attention. Here, two chiral thermochromic ferroelastic crystals (  S  &#8208;CTA)  2  CuCl  4  and (  R  &#8208;CTA)  2  CuCl  4  (CTA = 3&#8208;Chloro&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxypropyltrimethylammonium) have been prepared with switchable properties in dielectricity, conductivity, second harmonic generation (SHG), piezoelectricity, ferroelasticity, chiral and thermochromic properties. Compared with traditional phase transition materials with switching feature, thermochromism brings additional spectral encryption possibilities for future information processing. To the best of our knowlege, this is the first case of chiral thermochromic ferroelastic that exhibit switching properties in seven physical channels. This work is expected to promote further exploration of multifunctional molecular switchable materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Synthesis of NiO Crystals Exposing Stable High&#8208;Index Facets</title>
      <dc:description>Metal oxides exposing high&#8208;index facets are potentially impactful in catalysis and adsorption processes owing to under&#8208;coordinated ions and polarities that alter their interfacial properties compared to low&#8208;index facets. Here, we report molten salt syntheses of NiO particles exposing a variety of crystal facets. We show that for a given anion (nitrate or chloride), the alkali cation has a notable impact on the formation of crystals exposing {311}, {611}, {100} and {111} faces. Based on parametric analysis of synthesis conditions, we posit that the crystallization mechanism is governed by the formation of growth units consisting of Ni(II) complexes whose coordination numbers are determined by temperature and the selection of anion (associated to the coordination sphere) and alkali cation (associated with the outer coordination sphere). Notably, our findings reveal that high&#8208;index facets are particularly favored in chloride media and are stable under prolonged periods of catalysis and steaming. Collectively, these results illustrate the potential of the molten salt method for scalable syntheses of high surface energy metal oxides.</dc:description>

      <title>Strong Metal&#8211;Support Interactions between Pt Single Atoms and TiO2</title>
      <dc:description>Strong metal&#8211;support interaction (SMSI) has gained great attention in heterogeneous catalysis field. However, whether single  &#8208;  atom catalyst can exhibit SMSI remains unknown. Here, we demonstrated that the SMSI can occur on TiO  2  supported Pt single atoms but at a much higher reduction temperature than that on Pt nanoparticles (NPs). In SMSI state Pt single atoms neither are covered by, nor sink into the subsurface of, TiO  2  support. The suppression of CO adsorption on Pt single atoms stems from the coordination saturation (18 electron role) rather than the physical coverage by support. Based on the new finding it is revealed that in 3&#8208;nitrostyrene hydrogenation reaction single atoms are the real active sites while Pt NPs barely contribute to the activity through selectively encapsulating the NP sites. The finding in this work provides a new approach to study the active sites by tuning the SMSI state.</dc:description>

      <title>Lewis Acid Coordination Redirects S&#8208;Nitrosothiol Signaling Output</title>
      <dc:description>
S&#8208;Nitrosothiols (RSNOs) serve as air&#8208;stable reservoirs for nitric oxide in biology and are responsible for a myriad of physiological responses. O&#8208;coordination by a Lewis acid both dramatically facilitates RSNO reduction and changes its signaling output from NO to N2O, following protonation of the Lewis acid capped hyponitrite that forms upon reduction.







Abstract
S&#8208;Nitrosothiols (RSNOs) serve as air&#8208;stable reservoirs for nitric oxide in biology. While copper enzymes promote NO release from RSNOs by serving as Lewis acids for intramolecular electron&#8208;transfer, redox&#8208;innocent Lewis acids separate these two functions to reveal the effect of coordination on structure and reactivity. The synthetic Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 coordinates to the RSNO oxygen atom, leading to profound changes in the RSNO electronic structure and reactivity. Although RSNOs possess relatively negative reduction potentials, B(C6F5)3 coordination increases their reduction potential by over 1&#8197;V into the physiologically accessible +0.1&#8197;V vs. NHE. Outer&#8208;sphere chemical reduction gives the Lewis acid stabilized hyponitrite dianion trans&#8208;[LA&#8208;O&#8208;N=N&#8208;O&#8208;LA]2&#8722; [LA=B(C6F5)3], which releases N2O upon acidification. Mechanistic and computational studies support initial reduction to the [RSNO&#8208;B(C6F5)3] radical anion, which is susceptible to N&#8722;N coupling prior to loss of RSSR.

      <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Catalyzed Ring&#8208;Closing C&#8208;O/C&#8208;O Metathesis of Aliphatic Ethers over Ionic Liquid under Metal&#8208;Free Conditions</title>
      <dc:description>O&#8208;heterocycles have wide applications, and their efficient and green synthesis is very interesting. Herein, we report hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalyzed ring&#8208;closing metathesis of aliphatic ethers to O&#8208;heterocycles over ionic liquid (IL) catalyst under metal&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free conditions.

Interface effect plays an important role in mediating the reaction rate due to the immiscibility between the products and the IL catalyst, and the products can be spontaneously separated. NMR analysis and DFT calculation suggest that a pair of cation and anion of [SO3H&#8208;BMIm][OTf] could form three strong H&#8208;bonds with an ether molecule, which catalyze the ether transformation via a cyclic oxonium intermediate. A series of O&#8208;heterocycles including tetrahydrofurans, tetrahydropyrans, morpholines and dioxane can be obtained from their corresponding ethers in excellent yields (e.g., &gt;99%).

      <title>Engineering Active Sites of Polyaniline for AlCl2+ Storage in Aluminum Battery</title>
      <dc:description>The reversible capacity of AlCl  4  &#8209;  intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation in conventional cathodes of aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs) is often difficult to be improved due to the large size of AlCl  4  &#8209;  anions. Therefore, it is highly desired to realize the intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation of other Al&#8208;based ions with smaller size. Here, we fabricated polyaniline/single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (PANI/SWCNTs) composite films and further protonated the PANI nanorods in them. The protonation endows PANI with more active sites and enhanced conductivity. More importantly, hyper self&#8208;protonated PANI (PANI(H  +  )) exhibits the reversible AlCl  2  +  intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation during discharge/charge process. As a result, the Al/PANI(H  +  ) battery displays a twice higher discharge capacity in comparison with the original composite films. Furthermore, PANI(H  +  )@SWCNT electrodes also display stable cycling life with only 0.003% capacity decay per cycle over 8000 cycles. In addition, owing to the excellent mechanical properties, PANI(H  +  )@SWCNT composite films can act as the electrodes of flexible AIBs. As a proof of concept, the flexible cable&#8208;type AIBs were assembled based on them and remained stable electrochemical performance at bending states. This work will pave the way for the applications of conducting polymers in AIBs and broadens the horizons of AIBs in flexible energy storage devices.</dc:description>

      <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Silicon&#8208;Stereogenic Silanes by Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetrizing Protoboration of Vinylsilanes</title>
      <dc:description>The catalytic asymmetric creation of silicon&#8208;stereocenter silanes is a long&#8208;sought but far less developed topic, and only a handful of examples have been reported. Moreover, the construction of (more than) two stereocenters&#8208;containing chiral silanes is a more arduous task and remains unexploited.  We herein  report an unprecedented copper&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrizing protoboration of divinyl substituted silanes with bis(pinacolato)diboron (B  2  pin  2  ). This method allows facile preparation of an array of enantiomerically enriched boronate&#8208;substituted organosilanes bearing contiguous silicon&#8208; and carbon&#8208;stereocenters with exclusive regioselectivity and generally excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

      <title>Chemoselective hydrogenation of nitroaromatics at the nanoscale Fe(III)&#8208;OH&#8208;Pt interface</title>
      <dc:description>Catalytic hydrogenation of nitroaromatics is deemed as an environment&#8208;benign strategy to produce industrially important aniline intermediates. Herein, we report that the Pt nanocrystals with Fe(OH) x  deposition, Fe(OH) x  /Pt, enable the selective hydrogenation of nitro group into amino group without hydrogenating other functional groups on aromatic ring. The unique catalytic behavior is identified to be associated with the Fe(III)&#8208;OH&#8208;Pt interfaces.

In situ  IR, XPS and isotope effect studies reveal that the Fe 3+  /Fe 2+  redox couple facilitates the hydrodeoxygenation of the &#8208;NO 2  group during hydrogenation catalysis.

      <title>Unprecedented kinetic inertness for a Mn2+&#8208;bispidine chelate: a novel structural entry for Mn2+&#8208;based imaging agents</title>
      <dc:description>The search for more biocompatible alternatives to Gd  3+  &#8208;based MRI agents, and the interest in  52  Mn for PET imaging call for ligands that form inert Mn  2+  chelates. Given the labile nature of Mn  2+  , high inertness is challenging to achieve. The strongly preorganized structure of the 2,4&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;disubstituted bispidol ligand L  1  endows its Mn  2+  complex with exceptional kinetic inertness. Indeed, MnL  1  did not show any dissociation for 140 days in the presence of 50 eq. of Zn  2+  (37&#176;C, pH 6), while recently reported potential MRI agents MnPyC3A and MnPC2A&#8208;EA have dissociation half&#8208;lives of 0.285 h and 54.4 h under similar conditions. In addition, the relaxivity of MnL  1  (4.28 mM  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  at 25&#176;C, 20 MHz) is remarkable for a monohydrated, small Mn  2+  chelate.  In vivo  MRI experiments in mice and determination of the tissue Mn content evidence rapid renal clearance of MnL  1  . Additionally, L  1  could be radiolabeled with  52  Mn and the complex revealed good stability in biological media.</dc:description>

      <title>Sandwich&#8208;like catalyst&#8208;carbon&#8208;catalyst trilayer structure as compact 2D host for highly stable lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Rational cathode design and compositing are expected to promote the compact Li&#8208;S batteries with the minimization of unloaded and non&#8208;polar volume spaces, which often take a high fraction in loose host framework with the prevailing point contacts between discrete catalyst nanodomains and conductive substrate. Herein, we propose a construction of sandwich structured host full of continuous 2D catalysis&#8208;conduction interfaces. This MoN&#8208;C&#8208;MoN trilayer architecture causes the strong conformal adsorption of S/Li2Sx and their high&#8208;efficiency conversion on the two&#8208;sided nitride polar surfaces, which are supplied with high&#8208;flux electron transfer from the buried carbon interlayer. The 3D self&#8208;assembly of these 2D sandwich structures further reinforces the interconnection of conductive and catalytic networks. The maximized exposure of adsorptive/catalytic planes endows the MoN&#8208;C@S electrode with excellent cycling stability (capacity degradation rate as small as 0.033% per cycle at 1 C over 1000 cycles) and high rate performance (515 mAh/g at 4.0 C) even under high S loading (75.7 wt%) and low host surface area (97 m2/g). The high conductivity of this trilayer texture does not compromise the capacity retention (604 mAh/g after 500 cycles) after increasing the S content to 3.4 mg/cm2. Such a job&#8208;synergistic mode between catalytic and conductive functions guarantees the homogeneous deposition of S/Li2Sx, and avoids their thick and devitalized accumulation (electrode passivation) even after high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;term cycling. Our chelation&#8208;ammonification method provides a facile solution to the dispersion of metal&#8208;cations and following attenuation of their nitride products during phase separation between C and MoN nuclei. The resultant plane&#8208;to&#8208;plane contact between MoN and C laminates addresses a novel preparation method of 2D nitrides.</dc:description>

      <title>Rh(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective Synthesis of Biaryls via C&#8208;H Activation and Intermolecular Coupling with Sterically Hindered Alkynes</title>
      <dc:description>Chiral biaryls make important synthetic building blocks and privileged ligands for asymmetric catalysis. Reported herein is atroposelective synthesis of biaryl NH isoquinolones via Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H activation of benzamides and intermolecular [4+2] annulation with a broad scope of 2&#8208;substituted 1&#8208;alkynylnaphthalenes as well as sterically hindered symmetric diarylacetylenes. The axial chirality is constructed based on dynamic kinetic transformation of the alkyne in redox&#8208;neutral annulation with benzamides, with alkyne insertion being stereo&#8208;determining. The reaction also accommodates both benzamides and heteroaryl carboxamides and proceeds in excellent regioselectivity (if applicable) and enantioselectivities (average 91.6% ee). An enantiomerically and diastereomerically pure rhodacyclic complex has been prepared and offers insight into enantiomeric control of the coupling system, and the steric interactions between the amide directing group and the alkyne substrate serve to dictate both the regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chiral biaryls make important synthetic building blocks and privileged ligands for asymmetric catalysis. Reported herein is atroposelective synthesis of biaryl NH isoquinolones via Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H activation of benzamides and intermolecular [4+2] annulation with a broad scope of 2&#8208;substituted 1&#8208;alkynylnaphthalenes as well as sterically hindered symmetric diarylacetylenes. The axial chirality is constructed based on dynamic kinetic transformation of the alkyne in redox&#8208;neutral annulation with benzamides, with alkyne insertion being stereo&#8208;determining. The reaction also accommodates both benzamides and heteroaryl carboxamides and proceeds in excellent regioselectivity (if applicable) and enantioselectivities (average 91.6% ee). An enantiomerically and diastereomerically pure rhodacyclic complex has been prepared and offers insight into enantiomeric control of the coupling system, and the steric interactions between the amide directing group and the alkyne substrate serve to dictate both the regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>DNA nanostructures as a tool for targeted antimicrobial delivery</title>
      <dc:description>We report the use of DNA origami nanostructures, functionalized with aptamers, as a vehicle for delivering the antibacterial peptide lysozyme in a specific and efficient manner. We test the system against Gram positive (  Bacillus subtilis  ) and Gram negative (  Escherichia coli  ) targets. We use direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (  d  STORM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to characterize the DNA origami nanostructures and structured illumination microscopy (SIM) to assess the binding of the origami to the bacteria. We show that treatment with lysozymefunctionalized origami slows bacterial growth more effectively than treatment with free lysozyme. Our study introduces DNA origami as a tool in the fight against antibiotic resistance, and our results demonstrate the specificity and efficiency of the nanostructure as a drug delivery vehicle.</dc:description>
