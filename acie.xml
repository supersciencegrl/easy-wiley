         <title>Geomimetic Hydrothermal Synthesis of Polyimide&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite its abundance, water is not widely used as a medium for organic reactions. However, under geothermal conditions, water exhibits unique physicochemical properties, such as viscosity, dielectric constant, and ionic product become similar to those of common organic solvents. In this study, for the first time, we synthesized highly crystalline polyimide&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (PICs) under geomimetic hydrothermal conditions. By exploiting triphenylene&#8208;2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexacarboxylic acid in combination with various aromatic diamines, PICs with various pore dimensions and crystallinities were synthesized. XRD, FT&#8208;IR, and DFT calculations revealed that the solubility of the oligomeric intermediates under hydrothermal conditions affected the stacking structures of the crystalline PICs. Furthermore, the synthesized PIC demonstrate promising potential as an anode material in lithium&#8208;ion battery owing to its unique redox&#8208;active property and high surface area.</dc:description>

         <title>Abiotic Formation of Amide Bond via Surface&#8208;Supported Direct Carboxyl&#8208;Amine Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amide bond formation is one of the most important reactions in biochemistry, notably being of crucial importance for the origin of life. Herein, we combine scanning tunneling microscopy and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies to provide evidence for thermally activated abiotic formation of amide bonds between adsorbed precursors through direct carboxyl&#8208;amine coupling under ultrahigh vacuum conditions by means of on&#8208;surface synthesis. Complementary insights from temperature&#8208;programmed desorption measurements and density functional theory calculations reveal the competition between cross&#8208;coupling amide formation and decarboxylation reactions on the Au(111) surface. Furthermore, we demonstrate the critical influence of the employed metal support: whereas on Au(111) the coupling readily occurs, different reaction scenarios prevail on Ag(111) and Cu(111). The systematic experiments signal that archetypical bio&#8208;related molecules can be abiotically synthesized in clean environments without water or oxygen.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA Aptamer&#8208;Cyanine Complexes as Generic Colorimetric Small&#8208;Molecule Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aptamers are promising biorecognition elements for sensors. However, aptamer&#8208;based assays often lack the requisite levels of sensitivity and/or selectivity because they typically employ structure&#8208;switching aptamers with attenuated affinity and/or utilize reporters that require aptamer labeling or which are susceptible to false positives. Dye&#8208;displacement assays offer a label&#8208;free, sensitive means for overcoming these issues, wherein target binding liberates a dye that is complexed with the aptamer, producing an optical readout. However, broad utilization of these assays has been limited. Here, we demonstrate a rational approach to develop colorimetric cyanine dye&#8208;displacement assays that can be broadly applied to DNA aptamers regardless of their structure, sequence, affinity, or the physicochemical properties of their targets. Our approach should accelerate the development of mix&#8208;and&#8208;measure assays that could be applied for diverse analytical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Setigerumine I: Biosynthetic Origins of the Elusive Racemic Papaveraceae Isoxazolidine Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The biosynthetic origins of the structurally related racemic isoxazolidine  Papaveraceae  alkaloids Setigerumine I, Dactylicapnosinine and Dactylicapnosine have remained elusive since their original isolation over two decades ago. Herein we report the first biosynthetic hypothesis for their formation and, inspired by it, the first synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Setigerumine I with accompanying computational rationale. Based on the results, these isoxazolidine alkaloids arise from racemizing oxidative rearrangements of prominent isoquinoline alkaloids Noscapine and Hydrastine. The key steps featured in this synthesis are a room temperature Cope elimination and a domino oxidation/inverse&#8208;electron demand 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of an axially chiral, yet configurationally unstable, intermediate. The work opens this previously inaccessible family of natural products for biological studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrophilic Activation of [1.1.1]Propellane for the Synthesis of Nitrogen&#8208;Substituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strategies commonly used for the synthesis of functionalised bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCP) rely on the reaction of [1.1.1]propellane with anionic or radical intermediates. In contrast, electrophilic activation has remained a considerable challenge due to the facile decomposition of BCP cations, which has severely limited the applications of this strategy. Herein, we report the electrophilic activation of [1.1.1]propellane in a halogen bond complex, which enables its reaction with electron&#8208;neutral nucleophiles such as anilines and azoles to give nitrogen&#8208;substituted BCPs that are prominent motifs in drug discovery. A detailed computational analysis indicates that the key halogen bonding interaction promotes nucleophilic attack without sacrificing cage stabilisation.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Strategies commonly used for the synthesis of functionalised bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCP) rely on the reaction of [1.1.1]propellane with anionic or radical intermediates. In contrast, electrophilic activation has remained a considerable challenge due to the facile decomposition of BCP cations, which has severely limited the applications of this strategy. Herein, we report the electrophilic activation of [1.1.1]propellane in a halogen bond complex, which enables its reaction with electron-neutral nucleophiles such as anilines and azoles to give nitrogen-substituted BCPs that are prominent motifs in drug discovery.

         <title>Dynamic Exchange of Substituents in a Prebiotic Organocatalyst: Initial Steps towards an Evolutionary System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All evolutionary biological processes lead to a change in heritable traits over successive generations. The responsible genetic information encoded in DNA is altered, selected, and inherited by mutation of the base sequence. While this is well known at the biological level, an evolutionary change at the molecular level of small organic molecules is unknown but represents an important prerequisite for the emergence of life. Here, we present a class of prebiotic imidazolidine&#8208;4&#8208;thione organocatalysts able to dynamically change their constitution and potentially capable to form an evolutionary system. These catalysts functionalize their building blocks and dynamically adapt to their (self&#8208;modified) environment by mutation of their own structure. Depending on the surrounding conditions, they show pronounced and opposing selectivity in their formation. Remarkably, the preferentially formed species can be associated with different catalytic properties, which enable multiple pathways for the transition from abiotic matter to functional biomolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Bulk electrocatalytic NADH cofactor regeneration with bipolar electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical regeneration of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) is an extremely important challenge for the electroenzymatic synthesis of many valuable chemicals. Although some important progress has been made with modified electrodes concerning the reduction of NAD  +  , the scale&#8208;up is difficult due to mass transport limitations inherent to large&#8208;size electrodes. Here, we propose instead to employ a dispersion of electrocatalytically active modified microparticles in the bulk of a bipolar electrochemical cell. In this way, redox reactions occur simultaneously on all of these individual microelectrodes without the need of a direct electrical connection. The concept is validated by using [Rh(Cp*)(bpy)Cl]  +  functionalized surfaces, either of carbon felt as a reference material, or carbon microbeads acting as bipolar objects. In the latter case, enzymatically active 1,4&#8208;NADH is electroregenerated at the negatively polarized face of the particles. The efficiency of the system can be fine&#8208;tuned by controlling the electric field in the reaction compartment and the number of dispersed microelectrodes. This wireless bioelectrocatalytic approach opens up very interesting perspectives for electroenzymatic synthesis in the bulk phase.</dc:description>

         <title>A Solid Transformation into Carboxyl Dimers Based on a Robust Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for Propyne/Propylene Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible solid transformation between solvent&#8208;bridged carboxyl dimers in HOF&#8208;30 and carboxyl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;carboxyl dimers in HOF&#8208;30a has been unveiled by single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction. In addition, microporous HOF&#8208;30a enables the selective adsorption of propyne over propylene according to single&#8208;component sorption and breakthrough experiments. The preferred propyne location in HOF has also been identified by SCXRD test.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylenediamine with the help of different solvents provides isostructural hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOF&#8208;30). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis reveals HOF&#8208;30 possesses 3D ten&#8208;fold interpenetrated dia nets connected by two kinds of hydrogen bonds, namely solvent&#8208;bridged carboxyl dimers and carboxyl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;carboxyl dimers. Degassing treatment for HOF&#8208;30 yields HOF&#8208;30a with 3D ten&#8208;fold interpenetrated dia nets but linked with sole carboxyl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;carboxyl dimers. Reversible hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen&#8208;bond transformation between solvent&#8208;bridged carboxyl dimers in HOF&#8208;30 and carboxyl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;carboxyl dimers in HOF&#8208;30a has been unveiled by single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>NMR Spectroscopy of the Main Protease of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and Fragment&#8208;Based Screening Identify Three Protein Hotspots and an Antiviral Fragment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the liquid&#8208;sate NMR spectroscopy analysis of the dimeric SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease (3CLp), including its backbone assignments, to study its complex conformational regulation. Using fragment&#8208;based NMR screening, we highlighted three hotspots on the protein, two in the substrate binding pocket and one at the dimer interface, and we identified a non&#8208;covalent reversible inhibitor of 3CLp that has antiviral activity in infected cells.







Abstract
The main protease (3CLp) of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, the causative agent for the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, is one of the main targets for drug development. To be active, 3CLp relies on a complex interplay between dimerization, active site flexibility, and allosteric regulation. The deciphering of these mechanisms is a crucial step to enable the search for inhibitors. In this context, using NMR spectroscopy, we studied the conformation of dimeric 3CLp from the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and monitored ligand binding, based on NMR signal assignments. We performed a fragment&#8208;based screening that led to the identification of 38 fragment hits. Their binding sites showed three hotspots on 3CLp, two in the substrate binding pocket and one at the dimer interface. F01 is a non&#8208;covalent inhibitor of the 3CLp and has antiviral activity in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infected cells. This study sheds light on the complex structure&#8208;function relationships of 3CLp and constitutes a strong basis to assist in developing potent 3CLp inhibitors.

         <title>Metabolic Labeling of Legionaminic Acid in Flagellin Glycosylation of Campylobacter jejuni Identifies Maf4 as a Putative Legionaminyl Transferase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Probes used to metabolically label legionaminic acid on bacterial flagella substantiated the identification of Maf4 as a putative legionaminyl transferase in Campylobacter jejuni (see picture). The labeled glycan could be detected intracellularly as its activated CMP analogue, on flagella by Western blot analysis, and on intact bacteria by confocal microscopy.







Abstract
Campylobacter jejuni is the major human food&#8208;borne pathogen. Its bipolar flagella are heavily O&#8208;glycosylated with microbial sialic acids and essential for its motility and pathogenicity. However, both the glycosylation of flagella and the exact contribution of legionaminic acid (Leg) to flagellar activity is poorly understood. Herein, we report the development of a metabolic labeling method for Leg glycosylation on bacterial flagella with probes based on azide&#8208;modified Leg precursors. The hereby azido&#8208;Leg labeled flagellin could be detected by Western blot analysis and imaged on intact bacteria. Using the probes on C.&#8197;jejuni and its isogenic maf4 mutant we also further substantiated the identification of Maf4 as a putative Leg glycosyltransferase. Further evidence was provided by UPLC&#8211;MS detection of labeled CMP&#8208;Leg and an in silico model of Maf4. This method and the developed probes will facilitate the study of Leg glycosylation and the functional role of this modification in C.&#8197;jejuni motility and invasiveness.

Using the probes on &lt;i&gt;C.&#8197;jejuni&lt;/i&gt; and its isogenic &lt;i&gt;maf4&lt;/i&gt; mutant we also further substantiated the identification of Maf4 as a putative Leg glycosyltransferase. Further evidence was provided by UPLC&#8211;MS detection of labeled CMP-Leg and an in silico model of Maf4. This method and the developed probes will facilitate the study of Leg glycosylation and the functional role of this modification in &lt;i&gt;C.&#8197;jejuni&lt;/i&gt; motility and invasiveness.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>APEX2&#8208;based Proximity Labeling of Atox1 Identifies CRIP2 as a Nuclear Copper&#8208;binding Protein that Regulates Autophagy Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seeking to overcome challenges with the identification of copper chaperone protein's binding partners, we used APEX2&#8208;based proximity labeling with Atox1 as the bait to identify weak/transient protein&#8211;protein interactions. Atox1 delivers copper into the nucleus and transfers it to a previously unrecognized nuclear copper binding protein CRIP2, and copper promotes CRIP2 degradation to induce ROS&#8208;mediated activation of autophagy.







Abstract
Mammalian cell nuclei contain copper, and cancer cells are known to accumulate aberrantly high copper levels, yet the mechanisms underlying nuclear accumulation and copper's broader functional significance remain poorly understood. Here, by combining APEX2&#8208;based proximity labeling focused on the copper chaperone Atox1 with mass spectrometry we identified a previously unrecognized nuclear copper binding protein, Cysteine&#8208;rich protein 2 (CRIP2), that interacts with Atox1 in the nucleus. We show that Atox1 transfers copper to CRIP2, which induces a change in CRIP2&#8242;s secondary structure that ultimately promotes its ubiquitin&#8208;mediated proteasomal degradation. Finally, we demonstrate that depletion of CRIP2&#8208;as well as copper&#8208;induced CRIP2 degradation&#8208;elevates ROS levels and activates autophagy in H1299 cells. Thus, our study establishes that CRIP2 as an autophagic suppressor protein and implicates CRIP2&#8208;mediated copper metabolism in the activation of autophagy in cancer cells.

         <title>Ultrathin Crystalline Covalent&#8208;Triazine&#8208;Framework Nanosheets with Electron Donor Groups for Synergistically Enhanced Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin crystalline 2D triazine polymer nanosheets with electron donor groups are prepared for the first time by a novel redox strategy. They demonstrate ultrahigh photocatalytic overall water splitting performance arising from the optimized band structure and improved light&#8208;responsive range from the electron donor groups introduced into the 2D ordered molecular plane.







Abstract
Ultrathin nanosheets have great potential for photocatalytic applications, however, suffer from enlarged band gap and narrowed visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive range due to the quantum confinement effect. Herein, we report a novel redox strategy for efficient preparation of ultrathin crystalline amide&#8208;functionalized covalent&#8208;triazine&#8208;framework nanosheets (CTF NSs) with enhanced visible light absorption. The CTF NSs exhibited photocatalytic hydrogen (512.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1) and oxygen (12.37&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1) evolution rates much higher than that of pristine bulk CTF. Photocatalytic overall water splitting could be achieved with efficient stoichiometric H2 (5.13&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1) and O2 (2.53&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1) evolution rates under visible light irradiation. Experimental and theoretical analysis revealed that introduction of amide groups as electron donor optimized the band structure and improve its visible&#8208;light absorption, hydrophilicity and carrier separation efficiency, thus resulting in the enhanced photocatalytic performance. The well&#8208;dispersed CTF NSs could be easily cast onto a support as a thin film device and demonstrate excellent photocatalytic activity (25.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2 for hydrogen evolution).

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Electrochemical NO Reduction into NH3 by MoS2 Nanosheet</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MoS2/GF behaves as a superb and durable electrocatalyst for ambient NH3 generation via NO reduction in acids. It is capable of attaining a Faradaic efficiency of 76.6&#8201;% and a large NH3 yield of up to 99.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1. The MoS2&#8208;based Zn&#8208;NO battery delivers a power density of 1.04&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with an NH3 yield of 411.8&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of NO not only offers an attractive alternative to the Haber&#8211;Bosch process for ambient NH3 production but mitigates the human&#8208;caused unbalance of nitrogen cycle. Herein, we report that MoS2 nanosheet on graphite felt (MoS2/GF) acts as an efficient and robust 3D electrocatalyst for NO&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion. In acidic electrolyte, such MoS2/GF attains a maximal Faradaic efficiency of 76.6&#8201;% and a large NH3 yield of up to 99.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1. Using MoS2 nanosheet&#8208;loaded carbon paper as the cathode, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept device of Zn&#8208;NO battery was assembled to deliver a discharge power density of 1.04&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an NH3 yield of 411.8&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1. Calculations reveal that the positively charged Mo&#8208;edge sites facilitate NO adsorption/activation via an acceptance&#8211;donation mechanism and disfavor the binding of protons and the coupling of N&#8722;N bond.

         <title>Re&#8208;imagining Priorities for Chemistry: A Central Science for &#8220;Freedom from Fear and Want&#8221;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemistry is central to addressing the challenges of human security in today's world, but surprisingly its role and contributions have not yet been explicitly defined. In this Essay, the repositioning of chemistry in this context is seen to present a powerful opportunity for its renewal as a science for the benefit of society. Chemists will need to play new roles and engage more directly and dynamically at the interface of science, society and policy.







Abstract
Human security, defined as &#8220;freedom from want and fear and freedom to live in dignity&#8221;, provides an overarching concept to address threats to human security dimensions such as health, food, economics, the environment and sustainable development, while placing the individual at the centre of attention. Chemistry is central to addressing these challenges, but surprisingly its role and contributions to human security have hitherto not been explicitly set out. This article situates chemistry in the human security framework, highlighting areas where chemistry knowledge, methods and products are vital. It underscores three complementary facets: 1)&#8197;chemistry contributes to many dimensions of human security, but needs to do much more in the light of oncoming global challenges; 2)&#8197;the human security framing illuminates areas where chemistry itself needs to adapt to contribute better, by intensification of current approaches and/or by building or strengthening chemistry tools, skills and competencies; and 3)&#8197;repositioning as central to human security affords chemistry a powerful opportunity to refresh itself as a science for the benefit of society&#8212;and it will need to engage more directly and dynamically at the interface of science, society and policy in order to do so.

         <title>Dynamic Restructuring of Coordinatively Unsaturated Cu Paddle Wheel Clusters to Boost Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to hydrocarbons involves a multistep proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) reaction. Second coordination sphere engineering is reported to be effective in the PCET process; however, little is known about the actual catalytic active sites under realistic operating conditions. Here, we design a defect metal&#8722;organic framework, HKUST&#8208;1, through a facile &#8220;atomized trimesic acid&#8221; strategy, in which Cu atoms are modified by unsaturated carboxylate ligands, producing coordinatively unsaturated Cu paddle wheel (CU&#8208;CPW) clusters. We investigate the dynamic behavior of the CU&#8208;CPW during electrochemical reconstruction through the comprehensive analysis of in situ characterization results. It is demonstrated that Cu2(HCOO)3 is maintained after electrochemical reconstruction and acts as real active sites. Mechanistic studies reveal that CU&#8208;CPW accelerates the proton&#8208;coupled multi&#8208;electron transfer (PCMET) reaction, resulting in a deep CO2 reduction reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Designer Outer Membrane Protein Facilitates Uptake of Decoy Molecules into a Cytochrome P450BM3&#8208;Based Whole&#8208;Cell Biocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report an OmpF loop deletion mutant, which improves the cellular uptake of external additives into an  Escherichia coli  whole&#8208;cell biocatalyst. Through co&#8208;expression of the OmpF mutant with wild&#8208;type P450BM3 in the presence of decoy molecules, the yield of the whole&#8208;cell biotransformation of benzene could be considerably improved. Notably, with C7AM&#8208;Pip&#8208;Phe the yield duodecupled from 5.7% to 70%, with 80% phenol selectivity. The benzylic hydroxylation of alkyl&#8208; and cycloalkylbenzenes was also examined, and with the aid of decoy molecules, propylbenzene and tetralin were converted to 1&#8208;hydroxylated products with 78% yield and 94% (  R  )  ee  for propylbenzene and 92% yield and 94% (  S  )  ee  for tetralin. Our results suggest that both the decoy molecule and substrate traverse the artificial channel, synergistically boosting whole&#8208;cell bioconversions.</dc:description>

         <title>An N&#8208;Trifluoromethylation/Cyclization Strategy for Accessing Diverse N&#8208;Trifluoromethyl Azoles from Nitriles and 1,3&#8208;Dipoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N  &#8208;Trifluoromethyl azoles are valuable targets in medicinal chemistry. However, their historically challenging synthesis makes them inaccessible. Classical preparation of  N  &#8208;CF3  &#160;  azoles relies on the functional group interconversions but suffers from tedious  N  &#8208;pre&#8208;functionalization and unfriendly agents. Introduction of the CF3 onto the nitrogen of heterocycles provides a direct route to such motifs, but the  N  &#8208;trifluoromethylation remains underdeveloped. Reported here is an alternative and scalable cyclization strategy based on NCF3&#8208;containing synthons for constructing  N  &#8208;CF3 azoles. The approach involves the  N  &#8208;trifluoromethylation of nitriles followed by a [3+2] cyclization between resulting  N  &#8208;CF3  &#160;  nitrilium derivatives and 1,3&#8208;dipoles. PhICF3Cl was an effective CF3  &#160;  source for the transformation. As a result, a generic platform has been established for the first time to divergently synthesize  N  &#8208;trifluoromethylated tetrazoles, imidazoles, and 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles by using sodium azide, activated methylene isocyanides, and diazo compounds as dipoles, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Triazolate&#8208;Framework Derived FeN&#8324;Cl&#8321;&#160;Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts with Hierarchical Porosity for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with high single atom densities, favorable electronic structures and fast mass transfer is highly desired. Here, metal&#8208;triazolate (MET) frameworks, a subclass of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with high N content, are utilized as precursors since they can enhance the density and regulate the electronic structure of single&#8208;atom sites as well as generate abundant mesopores simultaneously. Fe single atoms dispersed in hierarchically porous N&#8208;doped carbon matrix with high metal content (2.78 wt.%) and configuration of FeN&#8324;Cl&#8321;&#160;(FeN&#8324;Cl&#8321;/NC) as well as mesopores with proportion of 0.92 (pore&#8208;volume ration) were obtained via the pyrolysis of a Zn/Fe&#8208;bimetallic MET modified with 4,5&#8208;dichloroimidazole. FeN&#8324;Cl&#8321;/NC exhibits excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in both alkaline and acidic electrolyte. Density functional theory calculations confirm Cl can optimize the adsorption free energy of Fe sites to *OH, thereby promoting the ORR process. Further, it demonstrates great potential in zinc&#8208;air batteries. This strategy may pave a new way for selecting, designing, and adjusting MOFs as precursors to build high&#8208;performance SACs.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrahigh Supramolecular Cascaded Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Capturing System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of two&#8208;step sequential phosphorescence energy transfer system is a challenging task in aqueous environment. Herein, for the first time, we report an ultrahigh supramolecular cascaded phosphorescence&#8208;capturing aggregate based on multivalent co&#8208;assembly strategy utilizing cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) and amphipathic sulfonatocalix[4]arene (SC4AD). The initial dibromophthalimide derivative (G) generated a weak phosphorescent emission at 505 nm by host&#8208;guest interaction with CB[7], which further assembled with SC4AD to form homogeneously spherical nanoparticles with the dramatical enhancement of both phosphorescence lifetime to 1.13 ms and emission intensity by 40&#8208;fold. Notably, such G&#8834;CB[7]@SC4AD aggregate exhibited efficient phosphoresce energy transfer to Rhodamine B (RhB) or benzothiadiazole (DBT) with high efficiency (&#1060;  ET  ) of 84.4&#160;% and 76.3&#160;% and antenna effect (AE) of 289.4 and 119.5, and then each of which can function as a bridge to further transfer their energy to second near&#8208;infrared acceptor Cy5 or Nile blue (NiB) to achieve the cascaded phosphorescence energy transfer (&#1060;  ET  : 54.0%, 60.5%, 58.9%, 74.1%; AE: 190.6, 97.0, 116.8, 46.2). The final aggregate with long&#8208;range effect from 425 nm to 800 nm and long&#8208;lived photoluminescence was further employed as imaging agent for multicolour cell labelling. This work provides a universal and feasible approach for the construction of cascaded phosphorescence energy transfer system in aqueous phase, which holds great promise in diverse fields including materials science and biological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomistic Insights of Irreversible Li+ Intercalation in MnO2 Electrode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tunnel&#8208;structured MnO  2  represents open&#8208;framed electrode materials for reversible energy storage. Its wide application is limited by the poor cycling stability, whose structural origin is unclear. Herein, targeting &#946;&#8208;MnO  2  , we tracked its structure evolution upon Li  +  ions insertion/extraction combining advanced  in situ  diagnostic tools at both electrode level (synchrotron X&#8208;ray scattering) and single&#8208;particle level (transmission electron microscopy). The instability is found to originate from a partially reversible phase transition between &#946;&#8208;MnO  2  and orthorhombic LiMnO  2  upon lithiation, causing cycling capacity decay. Moreover, the MnO  2  /LiMnO  2  interface exhibits multiple arrow&#8208;headed disordered regions, which severely chop into the host and undermine its structural integrity. Our findings could account for the cycling instability of tunnel&#8208;structured materials, based on which future strategies should focus on tuning the charge transport kinetics toward performance enhancement.</dc:description>

The instability is found to originate from a partially reversible phase transition between &#946;-MnO  2  and orthorhombic LiMnO  2  upon lithiation, causing cycling capacity decay. Moreover, the MnO  2  /LiMnO  2  interface exhibits multiple arrow-headed disordered regions, which severely chop into the host and undermine its structural integrity. Our findings could account for the cycling instability of tunnel-structured materials, based on which future strategies should focus on tuning the charge transport kinetics toward performance enhancement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Near&#8208;Equilibrium Growth of Chemically Stable Covalent Organic Frameworks&#8208;Graphene Oxide Hybrid Materials for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Facile synthesis and post&#8208;processing of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) under mild synthetic conditions are extremely desired and important for wide utilizations in catalysis and energy storage. Here we report the synthesis of chemically stable aza&#8208;fused BPT&#8208;COF and newly PT&#8208;COF via a liquid phase method. The process is achieved by the spontaneous polycondensation between vicinal diamines and vicinal diketones, and is driven by the near&#8208;equilibrium growth of COF domains at a very low monomer concentration. The method permits in situ assembly of COFs and COF&#8208;GO hybrid materials, and forms uniform conducting film on arbitrary substrates via vacuum filtration. When used as electrocatalysts, the as&#8208;prepared membranes show a fast hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with low overpotential (45 mV at 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  ) and small Tafel slope (53 mV dec  &#8211;1  ), which are the best among metal&#8208;free catalysts. Our results may open a new route towards preparation of highly &#960;&#8208;conjugated COFs for multi&#8208;functional applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Secondary Structure Tuning of a Pseudoprotein Between &#946;&#8208;Meander and &#945;&#8208;Helical Forms in the Solid&#8208;State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuning the secondary structure of a protein or polymer in the solid&#8208;state is challenging. Here we report the topochemical synthesis of a pseudoprotein and its secondary structure tuning in the solid&#8208;state.&#160;We designed the dipeptide monomer N3&#8208;Leu&#8208;Ala&#8208;NH&#8208;CH2&#8208;C&#8801;CH (1) for&#160;topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) polymerization. Dipeptide&#160;1&#160;adopts an anti&#8208;parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;like stacked arrangement in its crystals. Upon heating, the dipeptide undergoes quantitative TAAC polymerization in a crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal fashion yielding large polymers. The reaction occurs between the adjacent monomers in the H&#8208;bonded anti&#8208;parallel stack, yielding pseudoprotein having a &#946;&#8208;meander structure. When dissolved in methanol, this pseudoprotein changes its secondary structure from &#946;&#8208;meander to &#945;&#8208;helical form and it retains the new secondary structure upon desolvation.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced On/Off Switching of the Surfactant Character of the o&#8208;Cobaltabis(dicarbollide) Anion with No Covalent Bond Alteration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum chemistry reveals a photoinduced cisoid to transoid rotation in the o&#8208;cobaltabis(dicarbollide) anion [o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722;, driven by the larger stability of the transoid rotamer in the excited triplet state. The non&#8208;radiative decay, supported by non&#8208;adiabatic molecular dynamics and the absence of signal in fluorescence mapping experiments, allow the thermal recovery of the dominant cisoid arrangement in water solution.







Abstract
Cobaltabis(dicarbollide) anion ([o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722;) is a well&#8208;known metallacarborane with multiple applications in a variety of fields. In aqueous solution, the cisoid rotamer is the most stable disposition in the ground state. The present work provides theoretical evidence on the possibility to photoinduce the rotation from the cisoid to the transoid rotamer, a conversion that can be reverted when the ground state is repopulated. The non&#8208;radiative decay mechanisms proposed in this work are coherent with the lack of fluorescence observed in 3D fluorescence mapping experiments performed on [o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722; and its derivatives. This phenomenon induced by light has the potential to destruct the vesicles and micelles cisoid [o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722; typically forms in aqueous solution, which could lead to promising applications, particularly in the field of nanomedicine.

         <title>gem&#8208;Difluoroallylation of Aryl Halides and Pseudo Halides with Difluoroallylboron Reagents in High Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coupling of a difluoroallylboronate with aryl and heteroaryl halides and triflates provides a convenient and broadly applicable synthesis of difluoroallylarenes. The difluoroallyl boron reagent is formed by a copper&#8208;catalyzed defluorinative borylation of the inexpensive reagent 3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropene, and the products undergo a wide range of reactions to a series of difluoro&#8208;substituted analogs of common biologically valuable building blocks.







Abstract
We report the palladium&#8208;catalyzed gem&#8208;difluoroallylation of aryl halides and pseudo halides with 3,3&#8208;difluoroallyl boronates in high yield with high regioselectivity, and we report the preparation of the 3,3&#8208;difluoroallyl boronate reactants by a copper&#8208;catalyzed defluorinative borylation of inexpensive gaseous 3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropene with bis(pinacolato)diboron. The gem&#8208;difluoroallylation of aryl and heteroaryl bromides proceeds with low catalyst loading (0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% [Pd]) and tolerates a wide range of functional groups, including primary alcohols, secondary amines, ethers, ketones, esters, amides, aldehydes, nitriles, halides, and nitro groups. This protocol extends to aryl iodides, chlorides, and triflates, as well as substituted difluoroallyl boronates, providing a versatile synthesis of gem&#8208;difluoroallyl arenes that we show to be valuable intermediates to a series of fluorinated building blocks.

         <title>An Iridium Catalytic System Compatible with Inorganic and Organic Nitrogen Sources for Dual Asymmetric Reductive Amination Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric reductive amination (ARA) is one of the most promising methods for chiral amine synthesis. Herein we report our efforts on merging two ARA reactions into a single&#8208;step transformation. Catalyzed by the iridium and steric hindered phosphoramidite complex, the readily available and inexpensive aromatic ketones and ammonium acetate initially undergo the first ARA to afford primary amines, which serve as the amine sources for the second ARA, and finally provide the enantiopure C2&#8208;symmetric secondary amine products. The developed process competently enables the successive coupling of both inorganic and organic nitrogen sources with ketones in the same reaction system. The Br&#248;nsted acid additive plays multiple roles in this procedure. It accelerates the formation of imine intermediates, minimizes the inhibitory effect from N&#8208;containing species on the iridium catalyst and reduces the primary amine side&#8208;products.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Annulations Involving the Activation of C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective functionalization of C(sp 3 )&#8722;H bonds using
transition metal catalysis is among the more attractive transformations
of modern synthetic chemistry. In addition to its inherent atom
economy, this type of reactions opens unconventional retrosynthetic
pathways that can streamline synthetic processes. However, the
activation of intrinsically inert C(sp 3 )&#8722;H bonds, and the selection
among very similar C&#8722;H bonds, represent highly challenging goals. In
recent years there has been notable progress tackling these issues,
especially with regard to the development of intermolecular reactions
entailing the formation of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;heteroatom bonds. Conversely,
the assembly of cyclic products from simple acyclic precursors using
metal&#8208;catalyzed C(sp 3 )&#8722;H bond activations has been less explored.
Only recently, the number of reports on this type of annulations is
starting to grow. Herein we review some of the more relevant
advances in this exciting topic.</dc:description>

         <title>Athermal, Chemically Triggered Release of RNA from Thioester Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An athermal approach to mRNA enrichment from total RNA using a self&#8208;immolative thioester linked nucleic acids (TENA) is described. Oligo(thymine) (oT) TENA has a six&#8208;atom spacing between bases which allowed TENA to selectively base&#8208;pair with polyadenine RNA. As a result of the neutral backbone of TENA and the hydrophobicity of the octanethiol end group, oT TENA is water insoluble and efficiently pulled down 93 &#177; 2% of EGFP mRNA at a concentration of 10 ng/&#956;L. Self&#8208;immolative degradation of TENA upon ambient temperature exposure to nucleophilic buffer components (Tris, DTT) allowed recovery of 55 &#177; 27 ng of mRNA from 3.1 ug of total RNA, which was not statistically different from the amount recovered using Dynabeads&#174; mRNA DIRECT Kit (89 &#177; 24 ng). Gene expression as measured by RT&#8208;qPCR was comparable for both enrichment methods, suggesting that the mild conditions required for enrichment of mRNA using oT TENA are compatible with RT&#8208;qPCR and other downstream molecular biology applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Achieving high electrical conductivity and thermoelectric power factor simultaneously for n&#8208;type organic thermoelectrics is still challenging. By constructing two new acceptor&#8208;acceptor n&#8208;type conjugated polymers with different backbones and introducing the 3,4,5&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl group to form the new n&#8208;type dopant  1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;(3,4,5&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole (TP&#8208;DMBI)  , high electrical conductivity of 11 S cm  &#8208;1  and power factor of 32 &#956;W m  &#8208;1  K  &#8208;2  are achieved. Calculations using Density Functional Theory show that TP&#8208;DMBI presents a higher singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) energy level of &#8208;1.94 eV than that of the common dopant 4&#8208;(1, 3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2, 3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzoimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl) phenyl) dimethylamine (N&#8208;DMBI) (&#8208;2.36 eV), which can result in a larger offset between the SOMO of dopant and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of n&#8208;type polymers, though that effect may not be dominant in the present work.&#160; The doped polymer films exhibit higher Seebeck coefficient and power factor than films using N&#8208;DMBI at the same doping levels or similar electrical conductivity levels. Moreover, TP&#8208;DMBI doped polymer films offer much higher electron mobility of up to 0.53 cm  2  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  than films with N&#8208;DMBI doping, demonstrating the potential of TP&#8208;DMBI, and 3,4,5&#8208;trialkoxy DMBIs more broadly, for high performance n&#8208;type organic thermoelectrics.</dc:description>

         <title>Mediated Inner&#8208;Sphere Electron Transfer Induces Homogeneous Reduction of CO2 via Through&#8208;Space Electronic Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrocatalytic reduction of CO  2  is an appealing method for converting renewable energy sources into value&#8208;added chemical feedstocks. We report a co&#8208;electrocatalytic system for the reduction of CO  2  to CO comprised of a molecular Cr complex and dibenzothiophene&#8208;5,5&#8208;dioxide (DBTD) as a redox mediator, which achieves high activity (TOF = 1.51&#8208;2.84 x 10  5  s  &#8211;1  ) and quantitative selectivity. Under aprotic or protic conditions, DBTD produces a co&#8208;electrocatalytic response with  1  by coordinating  trans  to the site of CO  2  binding and mediating electron transfer from the electrode with quantitative efficiency for CO. This assembly is reliant on through&#8208;space electronic conjugation between the  &#960;  frameworks of DBTD and the bpy fragment of the catalyst ligand, with contributions from dispersive interactions and weak sulfone coordination.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We&#160;report the first catalytic enantioselective conjugate addition of allyl groups to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. The chemistry exploits the visible&#8208;light&#8208;excitation of chiral iminium ions to activate allyl silanes towards the formation of allylic radicals, which are then intercepted stereoselectively. The underlying radical mechanism of this process overcomes the poor regio&#8208; and chemo&#8208;selectivity that traditionally affects the conjugate allylation of enals proceeding via polar pathways. We also demonstrate how this organocatalytic strategy could selectively install a valuable prenyl fragment at the &#946;&#8208;carbon of enals.</dc:description>

A Cas14a1&#8208;based RNA&#8208;activated detection platform (Amplification, Transcription, Cas14a1&#8208;based RNA&#8208;activated trans ssDNA cleavage, ATCas&#8208;RNA) has an outstanding specificity for the detection of target RNAs with point mutation resolution, which is better than that of the Cas14a1&#8208;based ssDNA&#8208;activation.







Abstract
As a CRISPR&#8208;Cas system (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and CRISPR associated proteins), Cas14a1 can cis/trans cleave single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA). Here, we describe an unreported capacity of Cas14a1: RNA can trigger the trans ssDNA cleavage. This Cas14a1&#8208;based RNA&#8208;activated detection platform (Amplification, Transcription, Cas14a1&#8208;based RNA&#8208;activated trans ssDNA cleavage, ATCas&#8208;RNA) has an outstanding specificity for the detection of target RNAs with point mutation resolution, which is better than that of the Cas14a1&#8208;based ssDNA&#8208;activation. Using ATCas&#8208;RNA via a fluorophore quencher&#8208;labeled ssDNA reporter (FQ), we were able to detect 1&#8197;aM pathogenic nucleic acid within 1&#8197;h, and achieve 100&#8201;% accuracy with 25 milk samples. This platform can serve as a new tool for high&#8208;efficiency nucleic acid diagnostics. Importantly, this work can expand our understanding of Cas14a1 and inspire further mechanisms and applications of Class&#8208;2 Cas systems.

         <title>Stereochemical Control via Chirality Pairing: Stereodivergent Syntheses of Enantioenriched Homoallylic Alcohols</title>

Catalytic stereodivergent syntheses of enantioenriched homoallylic alcohols using chiral nonracemic &#945;&#8208;CH2Bpin&#8208;substituted E&#8208;crotylboronate via chirality pairing is developed.







Abstract
We report herein the development of stereodivergent syntheses of enantioenriched homoallylic alcohols using chiral nonracemic &#945;&#8208;CH2Bpin&#8208;substituted crotylboronate. Chiral phosphoric acid (S)&#8208;A&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allyl addition with the reagent gave Z&#8208;anti&#8208;homoallylic alcohols with excellent enantioselectivities and Z&#8208;selectivities. When the enantiomeric acid catalyst (R)&#8208;A was utilized, the stereoselectivity was completely reversed and E&#8208;anti&#8208;homoallylic alcohols were obtained with high E&#8208;selectivities and excellent enantioselectivities. By pairing the chirality of the boron reagent with the catalyst, two complementary stereoisomers of chiral homoallylic alcohols can be obtained selectively from the same boron reagent. DFT computational studies were conducted to probe the origins of the observed stereoselectivity. These reactions generate highly enantioenriched homoallylic alcohol products that are valuable for rapid construction of polyketide structural frameworks.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of 9NHAc&#8208;GD2 Antigen to Overcome the Hydrolytic Instability of O&#8208;Acetylated&#8208;GD2 for Anticancer Conjugate Vaccine Development</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 45, Page 24179-24188, November 2, 2021. </description>

A potential anticancer vaccine was produced by the conjugation of bacteriophage Q&#946; virus&#8208;like particle with the chemoenzymatically synthesized 9&#8208;NHAc&#8208;GD2 mimic of the 9&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated GD2 antigen. The conjugate produced robust and long&#8208;lasting IgG responses in mice and canines with no observed adverse effects.







Abstract
Ganglioside GD2 is an attractive tumor&#8208;associated carbohydrate antigen for anti&#8208;cancer vaccine development. However, its low immunogenicity and the significant side effects observed with anti&#8208;GD2 antibodies present significant obstacles for vaccines. To overcome these, a new GD2 derivative bearing an N&#8208;acetamide (NHAc) at its non&#8208;reducing end neuraminic acid (9NHAc&#8208;GD2) has been designed to mimic the 9&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated&#8208;GD2 (9OAc&#8208;GD2), a GD2 based antigen with a restricted expression on tumor cells. 9NHAc&#8208;GD2 was synthesized efficiently via a chemoenzymatic method and subsequently conjugated with a powerful carrier bacteriophage Q&#946;. Mouse immunization with the Q&#946;&#8208;9NHAc&#8208;GD2 conjugate elicited strong and long&#8208;lasting IgG antibodies, which were highly selective toward 9NHAc&#8208;GD2 with little cross&#8208;recognition of GD2. Immunization of canines with Q&#946;&#8208;9NHAc&#8208;GD2 showed the construct was immunogenic in canines with little adverse effects, paving the way for future clinical translation to humans.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Divergent Construction of (Dihydro)thiophenes with DMSO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 45, Page 24284-24291, November 2, 2021. </description>

We report herein a redox&#8208;divergent construction of dihydrothiophenes, thiophenes, and bromothiophenes from readily available allylic alcohols, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and HBr, respectively. This strategy can serve for the programmable and concise synthesis of bioactive and functional molecules.







Abstract
Thiophene&#8208;based rings are one of the most widely used building blocks for the synthesis of sulfur&#8208;containing molecules. Inspired by the redox diversity of these features in nature, we demonstrate herein a redox&#8208;divergent construction of dihydrothiophenes, thiophenes, and bromothiophenes from the respective readily available allylic alcohols, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and HBr. The redox&#8208;divergent selectivity could be manipulated mainly by controlling the dosage of DMSO and HBr. Mechanistic studies suggest that DMSO simultaneously acts as an oxidant and a sulfur donor. The synthetic potentials of the products as platform molecules were also demonstrated by various derivatizations, including the preparation of bioactive and functional molecules.

         <title>A Solvent&#8208;Polarity&#8208;Induced Interface Self&#8208;Assembly Strategy towards Mesoporous Triazine&#8208;Based Carbon Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 45, Page 24299-24305, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208;polarity&#8208;induced interface self&#8208;assembly strategy is proposed for the synthesis of mesoporous triazine&#8208;based carbon materials. It exhibits precise, tunable pore sizes and pore structures. CO2 molecules can be adsorbed well as a result of the suitable pore sizes and the triazine unit.







Abstract
Triazine&#8208;based materials with porous structure have recently received numerous attentions as a fascinating new class because of their superior potential for various applications. However, it is still a formidable challenge to obtain triazine&#8208;based materials with precise adjustable meso&#8208;scaled pore sizes and controllable pore structures by reported synthesis approaches. Herein, we develop a solvent polarity induced interface self&#8208;assembly strategy to construct mesoporous triazine&#8208;based carbon materials. In this method, we employ a mixed solvent system within a suitable range of polarity (0.223&#8804;Lippert&#8211;Mataga parameter (&#916;f) &#8804;0.295) to induce valid self&#8208;assembly of skeleton precursor and surfactant. The as&#8208;prepared mesoporous triazine&#8208;based carbon materials possess uniform tunable pore sizes (8.2&#8211;14.0&#8197;nm), high surface areas and ultrahigh nitrogen content (up to 18&#8201;%). Owing to these intriguing advantages, the fabricated mesoporous triazine&#8208;based carbon materials as functionalized porous solid absorbents exhibit predominant CO2 adsorption performance and exceptional selectivity for the capture of CO2 over N2.

Owing to these intriguing advantages, the fabricated mesoporous triazine-based carbon materials as functionalized porous solid absorbents exhibit predominant CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption performance and exceptional selectivity for the capture of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Printed Nanochain&#8208;Based Colorimetric Assay for Quantitative Virus Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 45, Page 24234-24240, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A printed nanochain&#8208;based colorimetric assay is utilized for point&#8208;of&#8208;care quantitative testing and real&#8208;time monitoring of viral infection with high sensitivity, specificity, and reliability. It enables rapid detection of various pathogens from tiny amounts of clinical sample with a smartphone.







Abstract
Fast and ultrasensitive detection of pathogens is very important for efficient monitoring and prevention of viral infections. Here, we demonstrate a label&#8208;free optical detection approach that uses a printed nanochain assay for colorimetric quantitative testing of viruses. The antibody&#8208;modified nanochains have high activity and specificity which can rapidly identify target viruses directly from biofluids in 15&#8194;min, as well as differentiate their subtypes. Arising from the resonance induced near&#8208;field enhancement, the color of nanochains changes with the binding of viruses that are easily observed by a smartphone. We achieve the detection limit of 1&#8197;PFU&#8201;&#956;L&#8722;1 through optimizing the optical response of nanochains in visible region. Besides, it allows for real&#8208;time response to virus concentrations ranging from 0 to 1.0&#215;105&#8197;PFU&#8201;mL&#8722;1. This low&#8208;cost and portable platform is also applicable to rapid detection of other biomarkers, making it attractive for many clinical applications.

         <title>Engineering Fluorophore Recycling in a Fluorogenic RNA Aptamer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 45, Page 24153-24161, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorogenic RNA aptamers bind to and activate the fluorescence of otherwise nonfluorescent dyes. Here we show an approach to maximize their fluorescence by reducing the impact of photobleaching. We engineered TBI, a fluorophore that rapidly dissociates upon photobleaching and can be rapidly replaced by TBI in the media. By maximizing &#8220;fluorophore recycling&#8221;, we achieve higher fluorescence and enable long&#8208;term fluorescence imaging.







Abstract
Fluorogenic aptamers can potentially show minimal photobleaching during continuous irradiation since any photobleached fluorophore can exchange with fluorescent dyes in the media. However, fluorophores have not been designed to maximize &#8220;fluorophore recycling.&#8221; Here we describe TBI, a novel fluorophore for the Broccoli fluorogenic aptamer. Previous fluorophores either fail to rapidly dissociate when they undergo photobleaching via cis&#8211;trans isomerization, or bind slowly, resulting in extended periods after dissociation of the photobleached fluorophore when no fluorophore is bound. By contrast, photobleached TBI dissociates rapidly from Broccoli, and TBI from the media rapidly replaces dissociated photobleached fluorophore. Using TBI, Broccoli exhibits markedly enhanced fluorescence in cells during continuous imaging. These data show that designing fluorophores to optimize fluorophore recycling can lead to enhanced fluorescence of fluorogenic aptamers.

         <title>A Surface Coordination Interphase Stabilizes a Solid&#8208;State Battery</title>

A nitrile group&#8208;induced coordination interphase on the surface of the LLZTO electrolyte stabilizes the electrolyte/electrode interface.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) show potential in addressing the safety issues of liquid batteries, but the poor interface contact between them and the electrodes hinders practical applications. Here, coordination chemistry of nitrile groups based on succinonitrile (SCN) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) is studied on the surface of Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO) SSE to build the chemical bonded electrolyte/electrode interfaces. The coordination of the nitrile group and LLZTO is clarified. A deformable PAN&#8208;modifying SCN electrolyte (PSE) interphase with stable ionic conductivity (10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and high lithium&#8208;ion transference number (0.66) is fabricated on the surface of LLZTO electrolyte based on the coordination competition of nitrile groups. Once applied to SSBs, it endows low interface resistance and strong bonding for the electrolyte/electrode interfaces so that the initial Coulomb efficiency reaches 95.6&#8201;% and the capacity remains 99&#8201;% after 250 cycles at 25&#8201;&#176;C.

Pnictaalenes with a pnictogen&#8722;aluminium double bond are inherently unstable and prone to dimerization. The synthesis of Lewis&#8208;base&#8208;free dipnictadialenes is revealed. It is shown that depending on the steric profile of the substituents either the alternating [CpxAl(&#956;&#8208;PAr)]2 dimers or the head&#8208;to&#8208;head species [ArPnAlCp3t]2 are formed. DFT studies corroborate that the different outcomes are thermodynamically driven.







Abstract
Using the AlI precursor Cp3tAl in conjunction with triphosphiranes (PAr)3 (Ar=Mes, Dip, Tip) we have succeeded in preparing Lewis base&#8208;free cyclic diphosphadialanes with both the Al and P&#8197;atoms bearing three substituents. Using the sterically more demanding Dip and Tip substituents the first 1,2&#8208;diphospha&#8208;3,4&#8208;dialuminacyclobutanes were obtained, whereas with Mes substituents [Cp3tAl(&#956;&#8208;PMes)]2 is formed. This divergent reactivity was corroborated by DFT studies, which indicated the thermodynamic preference for the 1,2&#8208;diphospha&#8208;3,4&#8208;dialuminacyclobutane form for sterically more demanding groups on phosphorus. Using Cp*Al we could extend this concept to the corresponding cyclic diarsadialanes [Cp*Al(&#956;&#8208;AsAr)]2 (Ar=Dip, Tip) and additionally add the phosphorus variants [Cp*Al(&#956;&#8208;PAr)]2 (P=Mes, Dip, Tip). The reactivity of one variant [Cp3tAl(&#956;&#8208;PPh)]2 towards NHCs was tested and resulted in double NHC&#8208;stabilised [Cp3t(IiPr2)Al(&#956;&#8208;PPh)]2.

An efficient and convenient palladium&#8208;catalyzed perfluoroalkylative carbonylation of unactivated alkenes has been developed. More than 100 examples of &#946;&#8208;perfluoroalkyl esters were prepared directly from readily available substrates with good functional group tolerance and chemoselectivity.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed multi&#8208;component carbonylation represents an efficient strategy for the preparation of various functionalized carbonyl&#8208;containing compounds. Herein, we report a general palladium&#8208;catalyzed perfluoroalkylative carbonylation of unactivated alkenes using inexpensive and readily available carbon monoxide as the C1 source and perfluoroalkyl halides as the coupling partner. A wide range of phenols and alcohols were transformed into the corresponding &#946;&#8208;perfluoroalkyl esters in high yields with broad functional group tolerance and good chemoselectivity. Additionally, alkyl halides can be utilized as alkoxy source as well to give the desired esters. Moreover, several pharmaceutical and bio&#8208;active molecules were also suitable substrates for this one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;component carbonylation process to give the targeted products in good yields.

         <title>Ethane&#8208;Based Catalytic Process for Vinyl Chloride Manufacture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 45, Page 24089-24095, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective and stable chlorination of ethane into 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane, a key intermediate for the production of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), is demonstrated over rare earth oxychloride catalysts, which will allow record productivities of vinyl chloride upon thermal cracking. This process paves the way for manufacturing PVC from natural gas instead of the currently applied ethylene (oil) or acetylene (coal), bringing significant cost and environmental benefits.







Abstract
The use of ethane as a platform molecule for the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is a longstanding challenge, which would allow to reduce the raw material costs and CO2 emissions to produce this plastic. Herein, we discover that rare earth oxychlorides catalyze in a selective (up to 90&#8201;%) and stable (&gt;50&#8197;h on stream) manner the reaction of ethane and molecular chlorine into 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane, which, upon established cracking, will translate into an order of magnitude higher vinyl chloride productivity compared to ethane oxychlorination technologies. In addition, representative europium oxychloride was supported on suitable carriers and was demonstrated to be selective (up to 90&#8201;%) and stable (&gt;40&#8197;h on stream) in extrudate form. These findings bring the ethane&#8208;based production of PVC one step closer to implementation.

         <title>Distorted Sandwich &#945;&#8208;Diimine PdII Catalyst: Linear Polyethylene and Synthesis of Ethylene/Acrylate Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 45, Page 24107-24115, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Distorted sandwich &#945;&#8208;diimine PdII catalysts with m&#8208;xylyl groups for axial shielding of the metal center provide living polymerization of linear polyethylene with low branching to be turned into either hard plastics or thermoplastic elastomers incorporating a range of acrylates in a one&#8208;pot by metal&#8208;organic insertion light&#8208;initiated polymerization.







Abstract
The introduction of m&#8208;xylyl substituents to &#945;&#8208;diimine PdII catalyst promotes living ethylene polymerization at room temperature and low pressure to yield high molecular weight polyethylene (PE) with low branching (&lt;17/1000&#8197;C). m&#8208;Xylyl groups provide a highly effective blockage to the axial sites of the catalytic center and form a distorted sandwich geometry. The shielding prevents chain&#8208;transfer and easy accessibility of polar monomers, leading to a living polymerization. Conducting a light irradiation as part of the one&#8208;step metal&#8208;organic insertion light initiated radical (MILRad) process leads to diblock copolymers of ethylene and acrylates. Incorporation of different acrylate block sequences can significantly modify the mechanical and chemical properties of block copolymers which can be modulated to be a hard plastic, elastomer, or semi&#8208;amorphous polymer.

         <title>Functional Porphyrinic Metal&#8211;Organic Framework as a New Class of Heterogeneous Halogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Donor Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 45, Page 24312-24317, November 2, 2021. </description>

A porphyrinic metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with an artificial halogen&#8208;bonding pocket can serve as an efficient heterogeneous halogen&#8208;bond&#8208;donor catalyst for the Diels&#8211;Alder reactions under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Biomimetic metal&#8208;organic frameworks have attracted great attention as they can be used as bio&#8208;inspired models, allowing us to gain important insights into how large biological molecules function as catalysts. In this work, we report the synthesis and utilization of such a metal&#8208;metalloporphyrin framework (MMPF) that is constructed from a custom&#8208;designed ligand as an efficient halogen bond donor catalyst for Diels&#8211;Alder reactions under ambient conditions. The implementation of fabricated halogen bonding capsule as binding pocket with high&#8208;density C&#8722;Br bonds enabled the use of halogen bonding to facilitate organic transformations in their three&#8208;dimensional cavities. Through combined experimental and computational studies, we showed that the substrate molecules diffuse through the pores of the MMPF, establishing a host&#8208;guest system via the C&#8722;Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction. The formation of halogen bonds is a plausible explanation for the observed boosted catalytic efficiency in Diels&#8211;Alder reactions. Moreover, the unique capability of MMPF highlights new opportunities in using artificial non&#8208;covalent binding pockets as highly tunable and selective catalytic materials.

         <title>Accelerated Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Alkene Hydrosilylation with Humic&#8208;Acid&#8208;Supported Electron&#8208;Deficient Platinum Single Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 45, Page 24220-24226, November 2, 2021. </description>

A humic&#8208;acid&#8208;based carbonaceous support material AHA_U_400 was prepared through mild thermal condensation and cross&#8208;linking between artificial humic acid and urea, and the material proved to enable the preparation of the stable Pt single&#8208;atom catalyst (Pt1@AHA_U_400). Pt was coordinated to two unsaturated O atoms, as well as one Cl&#8722; and one HCl moiety.







Abstract
The hydrosilylation reaction is one of the largest&#8208;scale applications of homogeneous catalysis, and Pt homogeneous catalysts have been widely used in this reaction for the commercial manufacture of silicon products. However, homogeneous Pt catalysts result in considerable problems, such as undesired side reactions, unacceptable catalyst residues and disposable platinum consumption. Here, we synthesized electron&#8208;deficient Pt single atoms supported on humic matter (Pt1@AHA_U_400), and the catalyst was used in hydrosilylation reactions, which showed super activity (turnover frequency as high as 3.0&#215;107&#8197;h&#8722;1) and selectivity (&gt;99&#8201;%). Density functional theory calculations reveal that the high performance of the catalyst results from the atomic dispersion of Pt and the electron deficiency of the Pt1 atoms, which is different from conventional Pt nanoscale catalysts. Excellent performance is maintained during recycle experiments, indicating the high stability of the catalyst.

         <title>Dirhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective B&#8722;H Bond Insertion of gem&#8208;Diaryl Carbenes: Efficient Access to gem&#8208;Diarylmethine Boranes</title>

We report highly enantioselective dirhodium&#8208;catalyzed B&#8722;H bond insertion reactions with diaryl diazomethanes as carbene precursors. These reactions afforded chiral gem&#8208;diarylmethine borane compounds in high yield (up to 99&#8201;% yield), high activity (turnover numbers up to 14&#8201;300), high enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee) and showed unprecedented broad functional group tolerance.







Abstract
The scarcity of reliable methods for synthesizing chiral gem&#8208;diarylmethine borons limits their applications. Herein, we report a method for highly enantioselective dirhodium&#8208;catalyzed B&#8722;H bond insertion reactions with diaryl diazomethanes as carbene precursors. These reactions afforded chiral gem&#8208;diarylmethine borane compounds in high yield (up to 99&#8201;% yield), high activity (turnover numbers up to 14&#8201;300), high enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee) and showed unprecedented broad functional group tolerance. The borane compounds synthesized by this method could be efficiently transformed into diaryl methanol, diaryl methyl amine, and triaryl methane derivatives with good stereospecificity. Mechanistic studies suggested that the borane adduct coordinated to the rhodium catalyst and thus interfered with decomposition of the diazomethane, and that insertion of a rhodium carbene (generated from the diaryl diazomethane) into the B&#8722;H bond was most likely the rate&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Bayesian Optimization of High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Compositions for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 45, Page 24144-24152, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study combines kinetic modeling and density functional theory calculations with Bayesian optimization to find optimal alloy compositions for the oxygen reduction reaction while sampling a minimum number of compositions. Starting from the Ag&#8208;Ir&#8208;Pd&#8208;Pt&#8208;Ru and Ir&#8208;Pd&#8208;Pt&#8208;Rh&#8208;Ru alloy systems, the discovered optimal Ag&#8211;Pd, Ir&#8211;Pt, and Pd&#8211;Ru alloys are subsequently validated experimentally.







Abstract
Active, selective and stable catalysts are imperative for sustainable energy conversion, and engineering materials with such properties are highly desired. High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) offer a vast compositional space for tuning such properties. Too vast, however, to traverse without the proper tools. Here, we report the use of Bayesian optimization on a model based on density functional theory (DFT) to predict the most active compositions for the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with the least possible number of sampled compositions for the two HEAs Ag&#8208;Ir&#8208;Pd&#8208;Pt&#8208;Ru and Ir&#8208;Pd&#8208;Pt&#8208;Rh&#8208;Ru. The discovered optima are then scrutinized with DFT and subjected to experimental validation where optimal catalytic activities are verified for Ag&#8211;Pd, Ir&#8211;Pt, and Pd&#8211;Ru binary alloys. This study offers insight into the number of experiments needed for optimizing the vast compositional space of multimetallic alloys which has been determined to be on the order of 50 for ORR on these HEAs.

         <title>Insight on the Order of Regioselective Ultrafast Formation of Disulfide Bonds in (Antimicrobial) Peptides and Miniproteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 45, Page 24137-24143, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoselective palladium catalysis used for the regioselective ultrafast synthesis of peptides and proteins bearing multiple disulfide bonds provided important insight into the order of oxidation (see picture). The approach, which produced a novel antimicrobial plectasin derivative with enhanced antibiotic activity relative to that of the natural product, should enable the practical synthesis of peptide/protein libraries for various applications.







Abstract
Disulfide&#8208;rich peptides and proteins are among the most fascinating bioactive molecules. The difficulties associated with the preparation of these targets have prompted the development of various chemical strategies. Nevertheless, the production of these targets remains very challenging or elusive. Recently, we introduced a strategy for one&#8208;pot disulfide bond formation, tackling most of the previous limitations. However, the effect of the order of oxidation remained an underexplored issue. Herein we report on the complete synthetic flexibility of the approach with respect to the order of oxidation of three disulfide bonds in targets that lack the knot motif. In contrast, our study reveals an essential order of disulfide bond formation in the EETI&#8208;II knotted miniprotein. This synthetic strategy was applied for the synthesis of novel analogues of the plectasin antimicrobial peptide with enhanced activities against methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a notorious human pathogen.

         <title>Lewis Pair Catalyzed Regioselective Polymerization of (E,E)&#8208;Alkyl Sorbates for the Synthesis of (AB)n Sequenced Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 45, Page 24306-24311, November 2, 2021. </description>

Lewis pairs were applied for living/controlled and 1,4&#8208;selective polymerization of sustainable (E,E)&#8208;alkyl sorbates. Poly((E,E)&#8208;alkyl sorbates) could be further converted into various polymers with strict (AB)n sequence structures, such as poly(sorbic acid), poly(propylene&#8208;alt&#8208;methyl acrylate), poly(propylene&#8208;alt&#8208;acrylic acid), poly(propylene&#8208;alt&#8208;allyl alcohol), and poly(ethylene&#8208;alt&#8208;2&#8208;butylene).







Abstract
In this contribution, Lewis pairs (LPs) composed of N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs) with different steric hindrance and nucleophilicity as Lewis bases (LBs) and Al&#8208;based compounds with comparable acidity but different steric hindrance as Lewis acids (LAs) were applied for 1,4&#8208;selective polymerization of (E,E)&#8208;methyl sorbate (MS) and (E,E)&#8208;ethyl sorbate (ES). The effects of steric hindrance, electron&#8208;donating ability, and acidity of LPs on MS and ES polymerization were systematically investigated. High catalytic activity and high initiation efficiency can be achieved, leading to the formation of PMS with 100&#8201;% 1,4&#8208;selectivity, tunable molecular weight (Mw up to 333&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1), and narrow molecular weight distribution (MWD). Block copolymerization of ES and methyl methacrylate (MMA) was also realized. Meanwhile, this system can be applied to other homologous conjugated diene substrates. Furthermore, simple chemical reactions can efficiently convert PMS to different polymers with strict (AB)n sequence structures, such as poly(sorbic acid), poly(propylene&#8208;alt&#8208;methyl acrylate), poly(propylene&#8208;alt&#8208;acrylic acid), poly(propylene&#8208;alt&#8208;allyl alcohol), and poly(ethylene&#8208;alt&#8208;2&#8208;butylene).

         <title>How Aromatic Are Molecular Nanorings? The Case of a Six&#8208;Porphyrin Nanoring**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 45, Page 24080-24088, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The correct assessment of the aromaticity of a 78&#960;&#8208;electron six&#8208;porphyrin nanoring hinges upon the choice of the computational method. Density functional approximations with a low percentage of long&#8208;range Hartree&#8211;Fock exchange commit large delocalization errors and suggest the presence of an aromatic ring current. The transition from the porphyrins to the bridging butadiyne linkers is responsible for the absence of an aromatic ring current.







Abstract
Large conjugated rings with persistent currents are novel promising structures in molecular&#8208;scale electronics. A six&#8208;porphyrin nanoring structure that allegedly sustained an aromatic ring current involving 78&#960; electrons was recently synthesized.

     alt="How Aromatic Are Molecular Nanorings? The Case of a Six-Porphyrin Nanoring**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The correct assessment of the aromaticity of a 78&#960;-electron six-porphyrin nanoring hinges upon the choice of the computational method. Density functional approximations with a low percentage of long-range Hartree&#8211;Fock exchange commit large delocalization errors and suggest the presence of an aromatic ring current. The transition from the porphyrins to the bridging butadiyne linkers is responsible for the absence of an aromatic ring current.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large conjugated rings with persistent currents are novel promising structures in molecular-scale electronics. A six-porphyrin nanoring structure that allegedly sustained an aromatic ring current involving 78&#960; electrons was recently synthesized. We provide here compelling evidence that this molecule is not aromatic, contrary to what was inferred from the analysis of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-NMR data and computational calculations that suffer from large delocalization errors. The main reason behind the absence of an aromatic ring current in these nanorings is the low delocalization in the transition from the porphyrins to the bridging butadiyne linkers, which disrupts the overall conjugated circuit. These results highlight the importance of choosing a suitable computational method to study large conjugated molecules and the appropriate aromaticity descriptors to identify the part of the molecule responsible for the loss of aromaticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Cooperative OSDA Blueprint for Highly Siliceous Faujasite Zeolite Catalysts with Enhanced Acidity Accessibility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 45, Page 24189-24197, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cooperative OSDA blueprint for high&#8208;silica FAU zeolites (Si/Al &gt;6) is presented. Only via true cooperation with a crown ether, could trans choline occupy the sod cages of the growing zeolite. Raman&#8208;tracking of the crystallization points to nucleation by the formation of sod&#8208; rather than D6R&#8208; or super&#8208;cages. Reliably low Al&#8208;contents and a unique acidity is thus obtained for a relevant catalytic topology, as validated by plastic waste cracking.







Abstract
A cooperative OSDA strategy is demonstrated, leading to novel high&#8208;silica FAU zeolites with a large potential for disruptive acid catalysis. In bottom&#8208;up synthesis, the symbiosis of choline ion (Ch+) and 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 (CE) was evidenced, in a form of full occupation of the sodalite (sod) cages with the trans Ch+ conformer, induced by the CE presence. CE itself occupied the supercages along with additional gauche Ch+, but in synthesis without CE, no trans was found. The cooperation, and thus the fraction of trans Ch+, was closely related to the Si/Al ratio, a key measure for FAU stability and acidity. As such, a bottom&#8208;up handle for lowering the Al&#8208;content of FAU and tuning its acid site distribution is shown. A mechanistic study demonstrated that forming sod cages with trans Ch+ is key to the nucleation of high&#8208;silica FAU zeolites. The materials showed superior performances to commercial FAU zeolites and those synthesized without cooperation, in the catalytic degradation of polyethylene.

         <title>General, Metal&#8208;free Synthesis of Carbon Nanofiber Assemblies from Plant Oils</title>

Carbon nanofibers can be conveniently prepared from plant oils in the presence of P2O5, using long&#8208;neglected Staudinger carbene chemistry. The fibers are shown to be electronically highly conductive and are exemplarily used for capacitive deionization.







Abstract
We designed a metal&#8208;free synthesis of carbon nanofiber based on ketene chemistry using phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) and vegetable oil. Based on the characterization of intermediates, P2O5&#8208;oil reaction yielded most possibly alkylketenes, which polymerized into poly(ketene) with abundant enol groups. The enol groups further reacted with P2O5, forcing the poly(ketene) to assemble into a nano&#8208;sized preassembly structure. Moderate heating transforms these structures into carbonaceaus nanofibers. This approach is applicable to other chemicals with similar structure to vegetable oil. The carbon nanofibers with P&#8208;O&#8208;C functionalization show relatively high graphitization degree and promising textural properties. The C&#8208;O&#8208;P environment accounts for 66&#8197;at&#8201;% of the total P and creates a superior thermal stability. As a model application, a CDI system built of a carbon&#8208;nanofiber&#8208;based electrode countered by an activated carbon&#8208;based electrode exhibited exceptional performance.

Two fused bithiophene imide dimer&#8208;based n&#8208;type polymers bearing hydrophilic branched methyl end&#8208;capped glycol side chains were developed, showing a high degree of backbone planarity, favorable polymer chain packing orientation, and substantial electrochemical doping efficiency.

Abstract
The development of n&#8208;type organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) lags far behind their p&#8208;type counterparts. In order to address this dilemma, we report here two new fused bithiophene imide dimer (f&#8208;BTI2)&#8208;based n&#8208;type polymers with a branched methyl end&#8208;capped glycol side chain, which exhibit good solubility, low&#8208;lying LUMO energy levels, favorable polymer chain orientation, and efficient ion transport property, thus yielding a remarkable OECT electron mobility (&#956;e) of up to &#8776;10&#8722;2&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and volumetric capacitance (C*) as high as 443&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3, simultaneously. As a result, the f&#8208;BTI2TEG&#8208;FT&#8208;based OECTs deliver a record&#8208;high maximum geometry&#8208;normalized transconductance of 4.60&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a maximum &#956;C* product of 15.2&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;1&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. The &#956;C* figure of merit is more than one order of magnitude higher than that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art n&#8208;type OECTs. The emergence of f&#8208;BTI2TEG&#8208;FT brings a new paradigm for developing high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymers for low&#8208;power OECT applications.

         <title>Ring Expansion Fluorination of Unactivated Cyclopropanes Mediated by a New Monofluoroiodane(III) Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 45, Page 24171-24178, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy for C&#8722;C bond cleavage and intramolecular ring expansion fluorination of unactivated cyclopropanes has been developed. The reaction consists of C&#8722;C bond scission and ring expansion fluorination, which are both promoted by a novel hypervalent fluoroiodane(III) reagent&#8197;1.







Abstract
Herein, we report a new strategy for carbon&#8722;carbon bond scission and intramolecular ring expansion fluorination of unactivated cyclopropanes, which was accomplished with a new hypervalent fluoroiodane(III) reagent 1. This novel method delivers medicinally relevant 4&#8208;fully substituted fluoropiperidines in moderate to high yields with excellent regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. Reagent 1, which has an N&#8208;acetylbenziodazole framework, was readily synthesized via three steps in 76&#8201;% overall yield and was characterized by NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography. Owing to the presence of a secondary I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O bonding interaction between the &#955;3&#8208;iodane atom and the carbonyl oxygen of the acetyl group of the N&#8208;acetylbenziodazole framework, 1 has excellent stability and can be stored at ambient temperature for 6&#8197;months without any detectable decomposition. Density functional theory calculations and experimental studies showed that the reaction proceeds via a carbocation intermediate that readily combines with a fluoride ion to generate the product.

This novel method delivers medicinally relevant 4-fully substituted fluoropiperidines in moderate to high yields with excellent regio- and diastereoselectivity. Reagent &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, which has an N-acetylbenziodazole framework, was readily synthesized via three steps in 76&#8201;% overall yield and was characterized by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. Owing to the presence of a secondary I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O bonding interaction between the &#955;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-iodane atom and the carbonyl oxygen of the acetyl group of the N-acetylbenziodazole framework, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; has excellent stability and can be stored at ambient temperature for 6&#8197;months without any detectable decomposition. Density functional theory calculations and experimental studies showed that the reaction proceeds via a carbocation intermediate that readily combines with a fluoride ion to generate the product.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Complex Crystal Structure and Abundant Local Defects of Zeolite EMM&#8208;17 Unraveled by Combined Electron Crystallography and Microscopy</title>

         <dc:description>
The complex crystal structure of EMM&#8208;17 polymorphs A and B containing a unique 10(12)&#215;10(12)&#215;11&#8208;ring channel system were directly solved using continuous rotation electron diffraction data. Polymorph C and a large number of structural defects were observed at the atomic resolution by integrated differential phase&#8208;contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy. EMM&#8208;17 exhibits excellent kinetic separation ability for C6 alkane isomers.







Abstract
In this study, we successfully solve polymorphs A and B of zeolite EMM&#8208;17, which can only crystallize in sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;sized crystals while containing complex stacking disorders, from the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) electron diffraction (ED) data. This is the first time that the atomic structure of this polymorph has been ab initio solved, and the result reveals a unique 10(12)&#215;10(12)&#215;11&#8208;ring channel system. Moreover, we acquire the first atomic&#8208;resolution images of EMM&#8208;17 using integrated differential phase&#8208;contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy. The images allow us to directly observe polymorphs B and C and discover a large number of local structural defects. Based on structural features unraveled from the reciprocal&#8208;space 3D ED data and real&#8208;space images, we propose a series of energetically feasible local structures in EMM&#8208;17. We also demonstrate that the unique porous structure of EMM&#8208;17 enables efficient kinetic separation of C6 alkane isomers.

         <title>Li4MgGe2S7: The First Alkali and Alkaline&#8208;Earth Diamond&#8208;Like Infrared Nonlinear Optical Material with Exceptional Large Band Gap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 45, Page 24131-24136, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first alkali and alkaline&#8208;earth compound with diamond&#8208;like structure, Li4MgGe2S7, was rationally designed and synthesized. The title compound, exhibiting wide band gap (4.12&#8197;eV) and good phase&#8208;matchable SHG response (0.7&#215;AGS), is a promising IR NLO material for high power laser application.







Abstract
Large band gap and strong nonlinear optical (NLO) effect are two valuable but contradictory parameters, which are difficult to balance in one infrared (IR) NLO material. Herein, the first alkali and alkaline&#8208;earth metal diamond&#8208;like (DL) IR NLO material Li4MgGe2S7, presenting a honeycomb&#8208;like 3D framework constructed by 6&#8208;membered LiS4 rings and GeMgS6 zigzag chains, was rationally designed and synthesized. The introduction of rigid alkali metal and alkaline&#8208;earth metal LiS4 and MgS4 tetrahedra effectively broadens the band gap of DL compound to 4.12&#8197;eV (the largest one in the reported quaternary metal chalcogenides), generating a high laser damage threshold of 7 &#215; AgGaS2 at 1064&#8197;nm. Furthermore, Li4MgGe2S7 displays a suitable SHG response (0.7 &#215; AgGaS2) with a type I phase&#8208;matching behavior. The results indicate that Li4MgGe2S7 is a promising IR NLO material for the high&#8208;power laser application and it provides an insight into the design of new DL compound with outstanding IR NLO performances.

Rapid and simple: an electrochemical sensor, based on a high&#8208;affinity dimeric DNA aptamer for the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein was developed to detect the wildtype and Alpha and Delta variant in unprocessed saliva samples in 10&#8197;minutes, providing a detection limit of 1000&#8197;copies&#8201;mL&#8722;1, clinical sensitivity of 80.5&#8201;% and specificity of 100&#8201;%.







Abstract
We report a simple and rapid saliva&#8208;based SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 antigen test that utilizes a newly developed dimeric DNA aptamer, denoted as DSA1N5, that specifically recognizes the spike proteins of the wildtype virus and its Alpha and Delta variants with dissociation constants of 120, 290 and 480&#8197;pM, respectively, and binds pseudotyped lentiviruses expressing the wildtype and alpha trimeric spike proteins with affinity constants of 2.1&#8197;pM and 2.3&#8197;pM, respectively. To develop a highly sensitive test, DSA1N5 was immobilized onto gold electrodes to produce an electrochemical impedance sensor, which was capable of detecting 1000 viral particles per mL in 1:1 diluted saliva in under 10&#8197;min without any further sample processing. Evaluation of 36 positive and 37 negative patient saliva samples produced a clinical sensitivity of 80.5&#8201;% and specificity of 100&#8201;% and the sensor could detect the wildtype virus as well as the Alpha and Delta variants in the patient samples, which is the first reported rapid test that can detect any emerging variant of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

Through judicious choice of reductant, a switchable diastereodivergent cyclisation of a single alkene&#8208;tethered imine, to either a trans&#8208;fused amino&#8208;indane or a cis&#8208;fused tetracyclic tetrahydroquinoline structure, is herein described.







Abstract
A reagent&#8208;controlled stereodivergent carbocyclisation of aryl aldimine&#8208;derived, photocatalytically generated, &#945;&#8208;amino radicals possessing adjacent conjugated alkenes, affording either bicyclic or tetracyclic products, is described. Under net reductive conditions using commercial Hantzsch ester, the &#945;&#8208;amino radical species underwent a single stereoselective cyclisation to give trans&#8208;configured amino&#8208;indane structures in good yield, whereas using a substituted Hantzsch ester as a milder reductant afforded cis&#8208;fused tetracyclic tetrahydroquinoline frameworks, resulting from two consecutive radical cyclisations. Judicious choice of the reaction conditions allowed libraries of both single and dual cyclisation products to be synthesised with high selectivity, notable predictability, and good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. Computational analysis employing DFT revealed the reaction pathway and mechanistic rationale behind this finely balanced yet readily controlled photocatalytic system.

         <title>Radical&#8208;Bridged Ln4 Metallocene Complexes with Strong Magnetic Coupling and a Large Coercive Field</title>

         <dc:description>
The synthesis of tetranuclear radical&#8208;bridged lanthanide metallocene complexes through the combination of [Cp*2Ln](BPh4) (Ln=Dy, Gd) and tetrazine&#8208;radical building blocks is reported. A thorough examination of their magnetic properties as well as computational studies support a radical&#8208;induced &#8220;giant&#8208;spin&#8221; model with strong exchange interactions, zero&#8208;field single&#8208;molecule&#8208;magnet behaviour and a large coercive field of 3&#8197;T.







Abstract
Inducing magnetic coupling between 4f elements is an ongoing challenge. To overcome this formidable difficulty, we incorporate highly delocalized tetrazinyl radicals, which strongly couple with f&#8208;block metallocenes to form discrete tetranuclear complexes. Synthesis, structure, and magnetic properties of two tetranuclear [(Cp*2Ln)4(tz.)4]&#8901;3(C6H6) (Cp*=pentamethylcyclopentadienyl; tz=1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine; Ln=Dy, Gd) complexes are reported. An in&#8208;depth examination of their magnetic properties through magnetic susceptibility measurements as well as computational studies support a highly sought&#8208;after radical&#8208;induced &#8220;giant&#8208;spin&#8221; model. Strong exchange interactions between the LnIII ions and tz. radicals lead to a strong magnet&#8208;like behaviour in this molecular magnet with a large coercive field of 30&#8197;kOe.

         <title>Carbazole&#8208;Fused Polycyclic Aromatics Enabled by Regioselective Scholl Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 45, Page 24124-24130, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbazole&#8208;fused polycyclic aromatic compounds with interesting geometry and useful properties (see picture) were synthesized by Scholl reactions, which enabled oxidative coupling of carbazole units in a regioselective manner. A nitrogen&#8208;containing aromatic bowl was characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, and new p&#8208;type organic semiconductors exhibited field effect mobility of up to 0.070&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in solution&#8208;processed thin&#8208;film transistors.







Abstract
The synthesis of new carbazole&#8208;fused polycyclic aromatics with interesting geometry and useful properties was explored using Scholl reactions. As found from the Scholl reactions of substrates having two carbazole units linked at different positions through o&#8208;phenylene, oxidative coupling of carbazole units occurred in a regioselective manner with new carbon&#8211;carbon bonds preferably formed at C3 and C4 in N&#8208;alkyl carbazoles. A new N&#8208;containing aromatic bowl was characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, and new p&#8208;type organic semiconductors exhibited field effect mobility of up to 0.070&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in solution&#8208;processed thin&#8208;film transistors.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Enhanced Antimicrobial Activity of Polymers Containing an Embedded Photosensitiser</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 45, Page 24248-24256, November 2, 2021. </description>

Embedding a photosensitiser monomer within antimicrobial polymer formulations provides two distinct mechanisms of antibacterial activity for a broader spectrum of action.







Abstract
This work presents the synthesis of a novel photosensitive acrylate monomer for use as both a self&#8208;catalyst in the photoinduced electron/energy transfer&#8211;reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) polymerisation process and a photosensitiser (PS) for antibacterial applications. Hydrophilic, cationic, and antimicrobial formulations are explored to compare the antibacterial effects between charged and non&#8208;charged polymers. Covalent attachment of the catalyst to well&#8208;defined linear polymer chains has no effect on polymerisation control or singlet oxygen generation. The addition of the PS to polymers provides activity against S.&#8197;aureus for all polymer formulations, resulting in up to a 99.99999&#8201;% killing efficacy in 30&#8197;min. Antimicrobial peptide mimetic polymers previously active against P.&#8197;aeruginosa, but not S.&#8197;aureus, gain significant bactericidal activity against S.&#8197;aureus through the inclusion of PS groups, with 99.998&#8201;% killing efficiency after 30&#8197;min incubation with light. Thus, a broader spectrum of antimicrobial activity is achieved using two distinct mechanisms of bactericidal activity via the incorporation of a photosensitiser monomer into an antimicrobial polymer.

         <title>Visualization of Vaccine Dynamics with Quantum Dots for Immunotherapy</title>

Visualization of spatiotemporal trafficking of vaccines is achieved with synthetic QDs for potent immune activation.







Abstract
The direct visualization of vaccine fate is important to investigate its immunoactivation process to elucidate the detailed molecular reaction process at single&#8208;molecular level. Yet, visualization of the spatiotemporal trafficking of vaccines remains poorly explored. Here, we show that quantum dot (QD) nanomaterials allow for monitoring vaccine dynamics and for amplified immune response. Synthetic QDs enable efficient conjugation of antigen and adjuvants to target tissues and cells, and non&#8208;invasive imaging the trafficking dynamics to lymph nodes and cellular compartments. The nanoparticle vaccine elicits potent immune responses and anti&#8208;tumor efficacy alone or in combination with programmed cell death protein 1 blockade. The synthetic QDs showed high fluorescence quantum yield and superior photostability, and the reliable and long&#8208;term spatiotemporal tracking of vaccine dynamics was realized for the first time by using the synthetic QDs, providing a powerful strategy for studying immune response and evaluating vaccine efficacy.

Combining alkali and alkaline&#8208;earth metal tetrahedra units with an excellent diamond&#8208;like structure (DLS) template, the first alkali and alkaline&#8208;earth metal DLS infrared nonlinear optical (NLO) material Li4MgGe2S7 was rationally designed and fabricated. This work enriches the diversity of DLS compounds, and opens an avenue for the design and exploration of new infrared NLO materials with excellent NLO properties, as outlined by Shilie Pan, Junjie Li et&#8197;al. in their Research Article on page&#8197;24333.

Enhancing magnetic coupling in 4f&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule magnets is an ongoing challenge. In their Research Article on page&#8197;24206, Akseli Mansikkam&#228;ki, Muralee Murugesu and co&#8208;workers have incorporated highly delocalized tetrazinyl radicals to bridge 4f&#160;metallocenes, forming tetranuclear complexes. A thorough examination of the magnetic properties and computational studies support a radical&#8208;induced &#8220;giant&#8208;spin&#8221; model with strong exchange interactions, zero&#8208;field SMM behaviour and a giant coercive field of 3&#8197;T.

Reticular chemistry translates the precision and expertise of organic and inorganic synthesis to the solid state. The most profound innovation of the field has been the elaboration of design strategies for the synthesis of extended crystalline solids through strong directional bonds. This Review highlights the classes of reticular materials, their functionalization, and the introduction of complexity into their backbones.







Abstract
At its core, reticular chemistry has translated the precision and expertise of organic and inorganic synthesis to the solid state. While initial excitement over metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) was undoubtedly fueled by their unprecedented porosity and surface areas, the most profound scientific innovation of the field has been the elaboration of design strategies for the synthesis of extended crystalline solids through strong directional bonds. In this contribution we highlight the different classes of reticular materials that have been developed, how these frameworks can be functionalized, and how complexity can be introduced into their backbones. Finally, we show how the structural control over these materials is being extended from the molecular scale to their crystal morphology and shape on the nanoscale, all the way to their shaping on the bulk scale.

Leveraging the unique properties of reticular materials has resulted in significant advances from both a fundamental and an applied perspective. This Review reports on the milestones in MOF and COF research and gives a critical view on progress in their real&#8208;world applications. The major challenges in the field that need to be addressed to pave the way for industrial applications are also discussed.







Abstract
The amalgamation of different disciplines is at the heart of reticular chemistry and has broadened the boundaries of chemistry by opening up an infinite space of chemical composition, structure, and material properties. Reticular design has enabled the precise prediction of crystalline framework structures, tunability of chemical composition, incorporation of various functionalities onto the framework backbone, and as a consequence, fine&#8208;tuning of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) and covalent organic framework (COF) properties beyond that of any other material class. Leveraging the unique properties of reticular materials has resulted in significant advances from both a fundamental and an applied perspective. Here, we wish to review the milestones in MOF and COF research and give a critical view on progress in their real&#8208;world applications. Finally, we briefly discuss the major challenges in the field that need to be addressed to pave the way for industrial applications.

         <title>Decarboxylative Hydroxylation of Benzoic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 45, Page 24012-24017, November 2, 2021. </description>

Herein, the first decarboxylative hydroxylation reaction to synthesize phenols from benzoic acids is reported. The method overcomes the challenges associated with conventional decarboxylation of benzoic acids and can be applied even for the late&#8208;stage functionalization.







Abstract
Herein, we report the first decarboxylative hydroxylation to synthesize phenols from benzoic acids at 35&#8201;&#176;C via photoinduced ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT)&#8208;enabled radical decarboxylative carbometalation. The aromatic decarboxylative hydroxylation is synthetically promising due to its mild conditions, broad substrate scope, and late&#8208;stage applications.

Muon spin rotation/resonance (&#956;SR) studies for 10&#8208;mesityl&#8208;1,8&#8208;bis(trifluromethyl)&#8208;9&#8208;phosphaanthracene visualized a paramagnetic species produced by addition of muonium (Mu). DFT calculations for the P&#8208;muoniation product suggested two isomers, and the metastable conformer including the almost planar fused tricyclic unit simulated the experimental hfcs. The metastable structure is promoted by the larger zero&#8208;point energy due to light muon (&#956;+).







Abstract
In this communication, we report muon spin rotation/resonance (&#956;SR) studies for understanding radical reactivity of 10&#8208;mesityl&#8208;1,8&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;9&#8208;phosphaanthracene. Transverse&#8208;field muon spin rotation (TF&#8208;&#956;SR) and muon avoided level&#8208;crossing resonance (&#956;LCR) measurements successfully visualized a paramagnetic species produced by regioselective addition of muonium (Mu) to the skeletal phosphorus atom. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the P&#8208;muoniation product suggested two possible isomers. Whereas the most stable isomer including the envelope&#8208;type phosphorus heterocycle shows considerably different hyperfine coupling constants (hfcs) from those of the TF&#8208;&#956;SR and &#956;LCR, the metastable structure accompanying the almost planar tricyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugated skeleton could simulate the experimentally determined hfcs. The metastable planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated paramagnetic tricyclic&#8208;fused skeleton is promoted by the larger zero&#8208;point energy due to the light muon (&#956;+), one ninth of the proton mass.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Aza&#8208;Sonogashira Cross&#8208;Coupling To Form Ynimines: Development and Application to the Synthesis of Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 45, Page 24028-24033, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ynimines that are usually difficult to access were readily prepared from simple starting materials under Cu catalysis. An unprecedented [5+1] heteroannulation was subsequently developed for the synthesis of aza&#8208;heterocycles, such as isoquinolines, azaindoles, azabenzofurans, azabenzothiophenes and carbolines (see scheme).







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;substituted alkynes, such as ynamines and ynamides, are versatile synthetic building blocks. Ynimines bearing additional nucleophilic and electrophilic centers relative to ynamines and ynamides are expected to have high synthetic potential.

&lt;p&gt;Ynimines that are usually difficult to access were readily prepared from simple starting materials under Cu catalysis. An unprecedented [5+1] heteroannulation was subsequently developed for the synthesis of aza-heterocycles, such as isoquinolines, azaindoles, azabenzofurans, azabenzothiophenes and carbolines (see scheme).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitrogen-substituted alkynes, such as ynamines and ynamides, are versatile synthetic building blocks. Ynimines bearing additional nucleophilic and electrophilic centers relative to ynamines and ynamides are expected to have high synthetic potential. However, their chemical reactivity remains unexplored owing mainly to the lack of synthetic accessibility. We report herein a versatile copper-catalyzed synthesis of ynimines from readily available &lt;i&gt;O-&lt;/i&gt;acetyl ketoximes and terminal alkynes. A wide range of &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl ketoximes derived from diaryl ketones, aryl alkyl ketones and dialkyl ketones underwent cross-coupling with a diverse set of terminal alkynes to afford the ynimines in good to excellent yields. An unprecedented [5+1] heteroannulation reaction exploiting the reactivity of the ynimine generated in situ was subsequently developed for the synthesis of medicinally important heterocycles, including isoquinolines, azaindoles, azabenzofurans, azabenzothiophenes and carbolines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pore&#8208;Bound Water at the Key Residue Histidine&#8197;37 in Influenza&#8197;A&#8197;M2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 45, Page 24075-24079, November 2, 2021. </description>

Water structure impacts biological processes. Within the Influenza&#8197;A&#8197;M2 proton channel, a bound water molecule proton was detected at a chemical shift of 11&#8197;ppm. Combining magic&#8208;angle spinning NMR, dynamic nuclear polarization and quantum chemical calculations, the water was found hydrogen bonded to N&#948;1 of the functional histidine&#8197;37 residue.







Abstract
Atomic details of structured water molecules are indispensable to understand the thermodynamics of important biological processes including the proton conduction mechanism of the M2 protein. Despite the expectation of structured water molecules based on crystal structures of Influenza&#8197;A&#8197;M2, only two water populations have been observed by NMR in reconstituted lipid bilayer samples. These are the bulk&#8208; and lipid&#8208;associated water populations typically seen in membrane samples. Here, we detect a bound water molecule at a chemical shift of 11&#8197;ppm, located near the functional histidine&#8197;37 residue in the M2 conductance domain, which comprises residues 18 to 60. Combining 100&#8197;kHz magic&#8208;angle spinning NMR, dynamic nuclear polarization and density functional theory calculations, we show that the bound water forms a hydrogen bond to the &#948;1 nitrogen of histidine&#8197;37.

         <title>A Tandem Strategy for Enhancing Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Activity of Single&#8208;Atom Cu&#8208;S1N3 Catalysts via Integration with Cu Nanoclusters</title>

A tandem catalyst composed of single Cu sites co&#8208;coordinated with N and S and atomically dispersed Cu clusters (Cu&#8208;S1N3/Cux) was developed for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. The Cu&#8208;S1N3/Cux exhibited a 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency for CO formation (FECO), outperforming the single&#8208;atomic Cu&#8208;N4 analogue (FECO=54&#8201;%).







Abstract
We developed a tandem electrocatalyst for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion comprising the single Cu site co&#8208;coordinated with N and S anchored carbon matrix (Cu&#8208;S1N3) and atomically dispersed Cu clusters (Cux), denoted as Cu&#8208;S1N3/Cux. The as&#8208;prepared Cu&#8208;S1N3/Cux composite presents a 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency towards CO generation (FECO) at &#8722;0.65&#8197;V vs. RHE and high FECO over 90&#8201;% from &#8722;0.55 to &#8722;0.75&#8197;V, outperforming the analogues with Cu&#8208;N4 (FECO only 54&#8201;% at &#8722;0.7&#8197;V) and Cu&#8208;S1N3 (FECO 70&#8201;% at &#8722;0.7&#8197;V) configurations. The unsymmetrical Cu&#8208;S1N3 atomic interface in the carbon basal plane possesses an optimized binding energy for the key intermediate *COOH compared with Cu&#8208;N4 site. At the same time, the adjacent Cux effectively promotes the protonation of *CO2&#8722; by accelerating water dissociation and offering *H to the Cu&#8208;S1N3 active sites. This work provides a tandem strategy for facilitating proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer over the atomic&#8208;level catalytic sites.

         <title>Direct Evidence on the Mechanism of Methane Conversion under Non&#8208;oxidative Conditions over Iron&#8208;modified Silica: The Role of Propargyl Radicals Unveiled</title>

The complex gas&#8208;phase reaction network present during methane conversion under non&#8208;oxidative conditions over iron&#8208;modified silica is unraveled, shedding light on the formation mechanism of C2+ hydrocarbons.







Abstract
Radical&#8208;mediated gas&#8208;phase reactions play an important role in the conversion of methane under non&#8208;oxidative conditions into olefins and aromatics over iron&#8208;modified silica catalysts. Herein, we use operando photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy to disentangle the elusive C2+ radical intermediates participating in the complex gas&#8208;phase reaction network. Our experiments pinpoint different C2&#8208;C5 radical species that allow for a stepwise growth of the hydrocarbon chains. Propargyl radicals (H2C&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;H) are identified as essential precursors for the formation of aromatics, which then contribute to the formation of heavier hydrocarbon products via hydrogen abstraction&#8211;acetylene addition routes (HACA mechanism). These results provide comprehensive mechanistic insights that are relevant for the development of methane valorization processes.

         <title>Chiral Selectivity of Secondary Nucleation in Amyloid Fibril Propagation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 45, Page 24008-24011, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amyloid&#8208;forming peptides are chiral substances. While the growth of amyloid fibrils is known to be enantiospecific, we show here that this applies also to secondary nucleation of monomers in the presence of fibrils. Secondary nucleation is only possible if the monomers in solution and aggregate are of the same chirality.







Abstract
Chirality is a fundamental feature of asymmetric molecules and of critical importance for intermolecular interactions. The growth of amyloid fibrils displays a strong enantioselectivity, which is manifested as elongation through the addition of monomers of the same, but not opposite, chirality as the parent aggregate. Here we ask whether also secondary nucleation on the surface of amyloid fibrils, of relevance for toxicity, is governed by the chirality of the nucleating monomers. We use short amyloid peptides (A&#946;20&#8208;34 and IAPP20&#8208;29) with all residues as L&#8208; or all D&#8208;enantiomer in self and cross&#8208;seeding experiments with low enough seed concentration that any acceleration of fibril formation is dominated by secondary nucleation. We find a strong enantio&#8208;specificity of this auto&#8208;catalytic process with secondary nucleation being observed in the self&#8208;seeding experiments only. The results highlight a role of secondary nucleation in strain propagation.

We use short amyloid peptides (A&#946;20-34 and IAPP20-29) with all residues as L- or all D-enantiomer in self and cross-seeding experiments with low enough seed concentration that any acceleration of fibril formation is dominated by secondary nucleation. We find a strong enantio-specificity of this auto-catalytic process with secondary nucleation being observed in the self-seeding experiments only. The results highlight a role of secondary nucleation in strain propagation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biocatalytic Asymmetric Cyclopropanations via Enzyme&#8208;Bound Iminium Ion Intermediates</title>

Engineering of a promiscuous 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT) resulted in an unusual cofactor&#8208;independent cyclopropanation enzyme that promotes the stereoselective addition of diethyl 2&#8208;chloromalonate to substituted cinnamaldehydes to afford various cyclopropanes with high diastereo&#8208; and enantiopurity.







Abstract
Cyclopropane rings are an important structural motif frequently found in many natural products and pharmaceuticals. Commonly, biocatalytic methodologies for the asymmetric synthesis of cyclopropanes rely on repurposed or artificial heme enzymes. Here, we engineered an unusual cofactor&#8208;independent cyclopropanation enzyme based on a promiscuous tautomerase for the enantioselective synthesis of various cyclopropanes via the nucleophilic addition of diethyl 2&#8208;chloromalonate to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. The engineered enzyme promotes formation of the two new carbon&#8208;carbon bonds with excellent stereocontrol over both stereocenters, affording the desired cyclopropanes with high diastereo&#8208; and enantiopurity (d.r. up to 25:1; e.r. up to 99:1). Our results highlight the usefulness of promiscuous enzymes for expanding the biocatalytic repertoire for non&#8208;natural reactions.

         <title>Live&#8208;Cell Imaging of Guanosine Tetra&#8208; and Pentaphosphate (p)ppGpp with RNA&#8208;based Fluorescent Sensors**
</title>

Genetically encodable fluorescent RNA sensors are engineered to detect (p)ppGpp in live cells. Under nutrient starvation, cells produce and accumulate (p)ppGpp as a response, which can now be observed using these sensors.







Abstract
Guanosine tetra&#8208; and pentaphosphate, (p)ppGpp, are important alarmone nucleotides that regulate bacterial survival in stressful environment. A direct detection of (p)ppGpp in living cells is critical for our understanding of the mechanism of bacterial stringent response. However, it is still challenging to image cellular (p)ppGpp. Here, we report RNA&#8208;based fluorescent sensors for the live&#8208;cell imaging of (p)ppGpp. Our sensors are engineered by conjugating a recently identified (p)ppGpp&#8208;specific riboswitch with a fluorogenic RNA aptamer, Broccoli. These sensors can be genetically encoded and enable direct monitoring of cellular (p)ppGpp accumulation. Unprecedented information on cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell variation and cellular dynamics of (p)ppGpp levels is now obtained under different nutritional conditions. These RNA&#8208;based sensors can be broadly adapted to study bacterial stringent response.

         <title>In&#8208;Cell Generation of Anticancer Phenanthridine Through Bioorthogonal Cyclization in Antitumor Prodrug Development</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 45, Page 24043-24047, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An antitumor prodrug platform generating a significant variation in the 3D structure in comparison to the free drug was developed. A totally inactive precursor was shown to produce a cytotoxic phenanthridine by bioorthogonal cyclization within a tumor model. The kinetic of cyclization was fast (&lt;10&#8197;ms) inside living cancer spheroids so as to prevent the drug formation outside of the tumor.







Abstract
Pharmacological inactivation of antitumor drugs toward healthy cells is a critical factor in prodrug development. Typically, pharmaceutical chemists graft temporary moieties to existing antitumor drugs to reduce their pharmacological activity. Here, we report a platform able to generate the cytotoxic agent by intramolecular cyclization. Using phenanthridines as cytotoxic model compounds, we designed ring&#8208;opened biaryl precursors that generated the phenanthridines through bioorthogonal irreversible imination. This reaction was triggered by reactive oxygen species, commonly overproduced in cancer cells, able to convert a vinyl boronate ester function into a ketone that subsequently reacted with a pendant aniline. An inactive precursor was shown to engender a cytotoxic phenanthridine against KB cancer cells. Moreover, the kinetic of cyclization of this prodrug was extremely rapid inside living cells of KB cancer spheroids so as to circumvent drug action.

         <title>Concise Total Synthesis of Agarozizanol&#8197;B via a Strained Photocascade Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 45, Page 24039-24042, November 2, 2021. </description>

Starting from a simple indanone derivative, diastereomerically pure intermediate 1 was formed in a photochemical cascade and served as precursor to agarozizanol&#8197;B (2), either as racemate or as single enantiomer after a resolution step.







Abstract
The prezizane&#8208;type sesquiterpene agarozizanol B was synthesized employing a photochemical cascade reaction as the key step. Starting from a readily available 1&#8208;indanone with a tethered olefin, a strained tetracyclic skeleton was assembled which contained all carbon atoms of the sesquiterpene with the correct relative configuration. The conversion into the tricyclic prezizane skeleton was accomplished by a strategic cyclopropane bond cleavage. Prior to the cyclopropane ring opening an adaption of the oxidation state was required, which could be combined with a reductive resolution step. After removal of two functional groups, the natural product was obtained both in racemic form or, if resolved, as the (+)&#8208;enantiomer which was shown to be identical to the natural product.

         <title>Hydrosulfide (HS&#8722;) Recognition and Sensing in Water by Halogen Bonding Hosts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 45, Page 24048-24053, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible chemosensing of hydrosulfide (HS&#8722;) in pure water is demonstrated using halogen bonding (XB) fluorescent hosts. The XB receptors exhibit characteristic selective quenching of fluorescence upon binding HS&#8722; whereas the hydrogen bonding receptor analogues proved incapable of functioning as chemosensors under aqueous conditions.







Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) plays a crucial signalling role in a variety of physiological systems, existing as the hydrosulfide anion (HS&#8722;) at physiological pH. Combining the potency of halogen bonding (XB) for anion recognition in water with coumarin fluorophore incorporation in acyclic host structural design, the first XB receptors to bind and, more importantly, sense the hydrosulfide anion in pure water in a reversible chemosensing fashion are demonstrated. The XB receptors exhibit characteristic selective quenching of fluorescence upon binding to HS&#8722;. Computational DFT and molecular dynamics simulations in water corroborate the experimental anion binding observations, revealing the mode and nature of HS&#8722; recognition by the XB receptors.

         <title>An Overlooked Natural Hydrogen Evolution Pathway: Ni2+ Boosting H2O Reduction by Fe(OH)2 Oxidation during Low&#8208;Temperature Serpentinization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 45, Page 24054-24058, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient natural H2 production during Lt&#8208;serpentinization through water reduction by Fe(OH)2 oxidation has been experimentally identified for the first time. This finding provides a new insight to explore the natural H2, which originated from the Ni2+ rich ultramafic rocks.







Abstract
Natural hydrogen (H2) has gained considerable attentions as a renewable energy resource to mitigate the globally increasing environmental concerns. Low&#8208;temperature serpentinization (&lt;200&#8201;&#176;C) as a typical water&#8211;rock reaction is a major source of the natural H2. However, the reaction mechanism and the controlling step to product H2 remained unclear, which hinders the further utilization of natural H2. Herein, we demonstrated that the H2 production rate could be determined by the Fe(OH)2 oxidation during low&#8208;temperature serpentinization. Moreover, the co&#8208;existence of Ni2+ could largely enhance the H2 production kinetics. With the addition of only 1&#8201;% Ni2+, the H2 production rate was remarkably enhanced by about two orders of magnitude at 90&#8201;&#176;C. D2O isotopic experiment and theoretical calculations revealed that the enhanced H2 production kinetics could be attributed to the catalytic role of Ni2+ to promote the reduction of H2O.

         <title>Application of Relaxation Dispersion of Hyperpolarized 13C Spins to Protein&#8211;Ligand Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 45, Page 24018-24021, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The change in the 13C transverse nuclear spin relaxation rate, also known as relaxation dispersion, is a sensitive parameter for determining the ligand binding mode in a protein binding site by NMR. The measurement of the 13C relaxation dispersion is enabled by the sensitivity gain of several thousand&#8208;fold provided by dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization.







Abstract
Nuclear spin relaxation dispersion parameters are proposed as indicators of the binding mode of a ligand to a protein. Hyperpolarization by dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (D&#8208;DNP) provided a 13C signal enhancement between 3000&#8211;6000 for the ligand 4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl) benzene&#8208;1&#8208;carboximidamide binding to trypsin. The measurement of 13C R2 relaxation dispersion was enabled without isotope enrichment, using a series of single&#8208;scan Carr&#8211;Purcell&#8211;Meiboom&#8211;Gill experiments with variable refocusing delays. The magnitude in dispersion for the spins of the ligand is correlated to the position with respect to the salt bridge between protein and the amidine group of the ligand, indicating the ligand binding orientation. Hyperpolarized relaxation dispersion is an alternative to chemical shift or NOE measurements for determining ligand binding modes.

         <title>Microscale Interfacial Polymerization on a Chip</title>

PEG&#8208;based hydrogels can be precisely localized in capillary&#8208;driven microfluidic chips by in situ interfacial polymerization. This allows using hydrogels for filtration, studying diffusion processes of solutes across the hydrogels and rapid bioassays.







Abstract
Forming hydrogels with precise geometries is challenging and mostly done using photopolymerization, which involves toxic chemicals, rinsing steps, solvents, and bulky optical equipment. Here, we introduce a new method for in situ formation of hydrogels with a well&#8208;defined geometry in a sealed microfluidic chip by interfacial polymerization. The geometry of the hydrogel is programmed by microfluidic design using capillary pinning structures and bringing into contact solutions containing hydrogel precursors from vicinal channels. The characteristics of the hydrogel (mesh size, molecular weight cut&#8208;off) can be readily adjusted. This method is compatible with capillary&#8208;driven microfluidics, fast, uses small volumes of reagents and samples, and does not require specific laboratory equipment. Our approach creates opportunities for filtration, hydrogel functionalization, and hydrogel&#8208;based assays, as exemplified by a rapid, compact competitive immunoassay that does not require a rinsing step.

         <title>Mechanochemically Synthesised Flexible Electrodes based on Bimetallic Metal&#8208;organic Framework Glasses for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The melting behaviour of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) has aroused significant research interest in the areas of materials science, condensed matter physics and chemical engineering. This work first introduces a novel method to fabricate a bimetallic MOF glass, through melt&#8208;quenching of the cobalt&#8208;based zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) [ZIF&#8208;62(Co)] with an adsorbed ferric coordination complex. The high&#8208;temperature chemically reactive ZIF&#8208;62(Co) liquid facilitates the formation of coordinative bonds between Fe and imidazolate ligands, incorporating Fe nodes into the framework after quenching. The resultant Co&#8208;Fe bimetallic MOF glass therefore shows a significantly enhanced oxygen evolution reaction performance. The novel bimetallic MOF glass, when combined with the facile and scalable mechanochemical synthesis technique for both discrete powders and surface coatings on flexible substrates, enables significant opportunities for catalytic device assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Virus&#8208;Mimicking Cell Membrane&#8208;Coated Nanoparticles for Cytosolic Delivery of mRNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Effective endosomal escape after cellular uptake represents a major challenge in the field of nanodelivery, as the majority of drug payloads must localize to subcellular compartments other than the endosomes in order to exert activity. In nature, viruses can readily deliver their genetic material to the cytosol of host cells by triggering membrane fusion after endocytosis. For the influenza A virus, the hemagglutinin (HA) protein found on its surface fuses the viral envelope with surrounding membrane at endosomal pH values. Here, biomimetic nanoparticles capable of endosomal escape were fabricated using a membrane coating derived from cells engineered to express HA on their surface. When evaluated in vitro, these virus&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles were able to deliver an mRNA payload to the cytosolic compartment of target cells, resulting in the successful expression of the encoded protein.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Effective endosomal escape after cellular uptake represents a major challenge in the field of nanodelivery, as the majority of drug payloads must localize to subcellular compartments other than the endosomes in order to exert activity. In nature, viruses can readily deliver their genetic material to the cytosol of host cells by triggering membrane fusion after endocytosis. For the influenza A virus, the hemagglutinin (HA) protein found on its surface fuses the viral envelope with surrounding membrane at endosomal pH values. Here, biomimetic nanoparticles capable of endosomal escape were fabricated using a membrane coating derived from cells engineered to express HA on their surface. When evaluated in vitro, these virus-mimicking nanoparticles were able to deliver an mRNA payload to the cytosolic compartment of target cells, resulting in the successful expression of the encoded protein. When the mRNA-loaded nanoparticles were administered in vivo, protein expression levels were significantly increased in both local and systemic delivery scenarios. We therefore conclude that utilizing genetic engineering approaches to express viral fusion proteins on the surface of cell membrane-coated nanoparticles is a viable strategy for modulating the intracellular localization of encapsulated cargoes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Facile Dissociation of Carbon&#8211;Oxygen bonds in CO2 and CO on the Surface of LaCoSiHx Intermetallic Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the facile dissociation of CO2 and CO on the surface of the LaCoSiHx catalyst is observed at room temperature. This is attributed to the marked electron transfer from catalysts into the antibonding orbital of CO2 and CO.







Abstract
In catalysis science, the electronic structure of the active site determines the structure&#8211;activity relationship of the catalyst to a large extent. Therefore, modulating the electronic structure has become a main route for the rational design of metal&#8208;based catalyst materials. In this work, we prepared a LaCoSiHx material that has more electronegativity and a lower workfunction than traditional supported Co&#8208;based catalysts. Using CO2 methanation as a model catalytic reaction, the facile dissociation of CO2 and CO (a key reaction intermediate) on the surface of the LaCoSiHx catalyst is observed by various experimental methods (e.g., in situ Raman and FTIR) at room temperature. Moreover, theoretical calculation results further show that LaCoSiHx has a much stronger capacity for carbon&#8211;oxygen bond activation than the Co surface. The intrinsic mechanism is attributed to the marked electron transfer from catalysts into the antibonding orbital of CO2 and CO.

         <title>Fatigue&#8208;Resistant Interfacial Layer for Safe Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A slide&#8208;ring polymer with a high stiffness, high toughness and excellent fracture resistance is designed to adapt its shape to dynamic electrode volume variations and stabilize the lithium anode upon cycling.







Abstract
The plating/stripping of Li dendrites can fracture the static solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and cause significant dynamic volume variations in the Li anode, which give rise to poor cyclability and severe safety hazards. Herein, a tough polymer with a slide&#8208;ring structure was designed as a self&#8208;adaptive interfacial layer for Li anodes. The slide&#8208;ring polymer with a dynamically crosslinked network moves freely while maintaining its toughness and fracture resistance, which allows it can to dissipate the tension induced by Li dendrites on the interphase layer. Moreover, the slide&#8208;ring polymer is highly stretchable, elastic, and displays an ultrafast self&#8208;healing ability, which allows even pulverized Li to remain coalesced without disintegrating upon consecutive cycling. The Li anodes demonstrate greatly improved suppression of Li dendrite formation, as evidenced by the high critical current density (6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and stable cycling for the full cells with high&#8208;areal capacity LiFePO4, high&#8208;voltage NCM, and S cathodes.

         <title>Boosting Oxygen Reduction via Integrated Construction and Synergistic Catalysis of Porous Platinum Alloy and Defective Graphitic Carbon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous platinum&#8208;rich alloy encapsulated by graphitic carbon results in improved oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance as a result of the interaction between the ternary PtCuCo alloy and graphitic Co&#8208;N&#8208;C units.







Abstract
Integrated fabrication through the strong interaction between catalyst and carrier is crucial to realize efficient oxygen electrocatalysis for fuel cells. We report herein a porous Pt&#8208;rich alloy encapsulated by graphitic carbon via integration engineering, where a synergistic catalysis between ternary PtCuCo alloy and graphitic Co&#8208;N&#8208;C results in the optimized reaction pathway and improved oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance. The hybrid catalyst PtCuCo@Co&#8208;N&#8208;C delivers a mass activity of 1.14&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 at 0.9&#8197;V vs. RHE and a peak power density of 960&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in the full&#8208;cell assessment, outperforming commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.12&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 and 780&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Experimental results combined with theoretical simulations suggest that the mutual assistance between porous Pt alloy and Co&#8208;N&#8208;C accounts for the enhanced catalytic performance. Such integrated engineering concept is significant for strengthening the anti&#8208;corrosion capabilities and improving the ORR performance of Pt&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>1,6&#8208;Anthrazoline&#8208;Linked &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Macrocycles and Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer via Friedl&#228;nder Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An old chemistry, but a new efficient method for the synthesis of &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocycles and 2D polymer! We demonstrated that Friedl&#228;nder synthesis which involves both dynamic imine condensation and aldol condensation is highly effective for the synthesis of kinetically stable, 1,6&#8208;anthrazoline&#8208;based all sp2 C/N containing macrocycles and crystalline 2D polymer.







Abstract
Synthesis of &#960;&#8208;conjugated crystalline two&#8208;dimensional (2D) polymers remains largely unexplored due to limited synthetic methodology. Herein, we report the preparation of a 1,6&#8208;anthrazoline (AZ)&#8208;linked crystalline 2D polymer AZP via acid mediated Friedl&#228;nder synthesis. The feasibility was examined first by two model reactions, followed by synthesis of three AZ&#8208;based macrocycles MCn (n=5&#8211;7), in which hexagonal MC6 was isolated as the major product. The favorable macrocycle formation could be largely attributed to the dynamic feature of Friedl&#228;nder synthesis, which involves both imine condensation and aldol condensation. The structure and crystallinity of AZP were confirmed by experiments and simulation. The skeletons of the macrocycles and polymer consist of all&#8208;sp2 hybridized C/N atoms and are thus &#960;&#8208;conjugated and electro&#8208;active. Our studies provide a rational way to access kinetically stable 2D crystalline polymers by combination of different dynamic covalent chemistries.

         <title>Plenty of Room at the Top: A Multi&#8208;Scale Understanding of nm&#8208;Resolution Polymer Patterning on 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Striped phase polydiacetylenes create 1&#8208;nm&#8208;resolution chemical patterns on 2D materials, well below the limits possible through most fabrication methods. A new multi&#8208;scale view of polymerization enables the design of monomers that undergo efficient on&#8208;surface polymerization, opening the door to new applications that rely on stable, near&#8208;atomic&#8208;scale chemical environments.







Abstract
Lamellar phases of alkyldiacetylenes in which the alkyl chains lie parallel to the substrate represent a straightforward means for scalable 1&#8208;nm&#8208;resolution interfacial patterning. This capability has the potential for substantial impacts in nanoscale electronics, energy conversion, and biomaterials design. Polymerization is required to set the 1&#8208;nm functional patterns embedded in the monolayer, making it important to understand structure&#8211;function relationships for these on&#8208;surface reactions. Polymerization can be observed for certain monomers at the single&#8208;polymer scale using scanning probe microscopy. However, substantial restrictions on the systems that can be effectively characterized have limited utility. Here, using a new multi&#8208;scale approach, we identify a large, previously unreported difference in polymerization efficiency between the two most widely used commercial diynoic acids. We further identify a core design principle for maximizing polymerization efficiency in these on&#8208;surface reactions, generating a new monomer that also exhibits enhanced polymerization efficiency.

         <title>Cooperative NHC/Photoredox Catalyzed Ring&#8208;Opening of Aryl Cyclopropanes to 1&#8208;Aroyloxylated&#8208;3&#8208;Acylated Alkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ring&#8208;opening/arylcarboxylation/acylation of mono, di and trisubstituted cyclopropanes enabled by cooperative NHC and organophotoredox catalysis for the preparation of &#947;&#8208;aroyloxy ketones is reported. Key step is the radical/radical cross coupling of a benzylic radical generated in the photoredox catalysis cycle and a ketyl radical formed in the NHC catalysis cycle.







Abstract
Cyclopropanes are an important class of building blocks in organic synthesis. Herein, a ring&#8208;opening/arylcarboxylation/acylation cascade reaction for the 1,3&#8208;difunctionalization of aryl cyclopropanes enabled by cooperative NHC and organophotoredox catalysis is reported. The cascade works on monosubstituted cyclopropanes that are in contrast to the heavily investigated donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes more challenging to be difunctionalized. The key step is a radical/radical cross coupling of a benzylic radical generated in the photoredox catalysis cycle with a ketyl radical from the NHC catalysis cycle. The transformation features metal&#8208;free reaction conditions and tolerates a diverse range of functionalities.

         <title>Overcoming the Low Driving Force in Forming Depolymerizable Polymers through Monomer Isomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans isomerization of fused&#8208;ring cyclooctene monomers substantially elevates the driving force in forming depolymerizable polymers, enabling living polymerization and block copolymer synthesis at initial monomer concentration &#8805;0.025&#8197;M. The sequence of isomerization&#8208;polymerization&#8208;depolymerization forms a unique closed&#8208;loop that can be exploited for developing chemically recyclable polymers.







Abstract
While depolymerizable polymers have been intensely pursued as a potential solution to address the challenges in polymer sustainability, most depolymerization systems are characterized by a low driving force in polymerization, which poses difficulties for accessing diverse functionalities and architectures of polymers. Here, we address this challenge by using a cyclooctene&#8208;based depolymerization system, in which the cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans alkene isomerization significantly increases the ring strain energy to enable living ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization at monomer concentrations &#8805;0.025&#8197;M. An additional trans&#8208;cyclobutane fused at the 5,6&#8208;position of the cyclooctene reduces the ring strain energy of cyclooctene, enabling the corresponding polymers to depolymerize into the cis&#8208;cyclooctene monomers. The use of excess triphenylphosphine was found to be essential to suppress secondary metathesis and depolymerization. The high&#8208;driving&#8208;force living polymerization of the trans&#8208;cyclobutane fused trans&#8208;cyclooctene system holds promise for developing chemically recyclable polymers of a wide variety of polymer architectures.

         <title>Orchestrating Nitric Oxide and Carbon Monoxide Signaling Molecules for Synergistic Treatment of MRSA Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The local delivery of gaseous signaling molecules (GSMs) has shown promising therapeutic potentials. However, although GSMs have a subtle interplay in physiological and pathological conditions, the co&#8208;delivery of different GSMs for therapeutic purposes remains unexplored. Herein, we covalently graft a nitric oxide (NO)releasing  N  &#8208;nitrosamine moiety onto the carbon monoxide (CO)releasing 3&#8208;hydroxyflavone (3&#8208;HF) antenna, resulting in the first NO/CO&#8208;releasing donor. Under visible light irradiation, photomediated co&#8208;release of NO and CO reveals a superior antimicrobial effect toward Gram&#8208;positive bacteria with a synergistic combination index of 0.053. The synergy of NO and CO hyperpolarizes and permeabilizes bacterial membranes, which, however, shows negligible hemolysis and no evident toxicity toward normal mammalian cells. Moreover, the co&#8208;release of NO and CO can efficiently treat MRSA infection in a murine skin wound model, showing a better therapeutic capacity than vancomycin.</dc:description>

         <title>Stacked Reticular Frame Boosted Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Chiral Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is intriguing as advanced chiroptical materials but never reported so far. Herein, we constructed chiroptical COF materials with CPL activity through the convenient Knoevenagel condensation of formyl&#8208;functionalized axially chiral linkers and C3&#8208;symmetric 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetriacetonitrile. Remarkably, the as&#8208;prepared chiral COFs showed high absorption and luminescent dissymmetric factors up to 0.02 (gabs) and 0.04 (glum), respectively. In contrast, the branched chiral polymers from the same starting monomers were CPL silent. The structural and spectral characterizations revealed that the reticular frame was indispensable for CPL generation via confined chirality transfer. Moreover, the reticular stacking was found to significantly boost the CPL performance due to the interlayer restriction of frame. This work demonstrated not only the first example of CPL active COF but also provided the insightful understanding of CPL generation through covalent reticular chemistry, which will play a constructive role in the future design of high&#8208;performance CPL materials.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chiral covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is intriguing as advanced chiroptical materials but never reported so far. Herein, we constructed chiroptical COF materials with CPL activity through the convenient Knoevenagel condensation of formyl-functionalized axially chiral linkers and C3-symmetric 1,3,5-benzenetriacetonitrile. Remarkably, the as-prepared chiral COFs showed high absorption and luminescent dissymmetric factors up to 0.02 (gabs) and 0.04 (glum), respectively. In contrast, the branched chiral polymers from the same starting monomers were CPL silent. The structural and spectral characterizations revealed that the reticular frame was indispensable for CPL generation via confined chirality transfer. Moreover, the reticular stacking was found to significantly boost the CPL performance due to the interlayer restriction of frame. This work demonstrated not only the first example of CPL active COF but also provided the insightful understanding of CPL generation through covalent reticular chemistry, which will play a constructive role in the future design of high-performance CPL materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Functionalized Silsesquioxane Nanomaterials by Rodium&#8208;Catalyzed Carbene Insertion into Si&#8208;H bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report carbene insertion into Si&#8208;H bonds of polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) for the synthesis of highly functionalized siloxane nanomaterials. Dirhodium(II) carboxylates catalyze insertion of aryl&#8208;diazoacetates as carbene precursors to afford POSS structures containing both ester and aryl groups as orthogonal functional handles for further derivatization of POSS materials. Four diverse and structurally varied silsesquioxane core scaffolds with one, three, or eight Si&#8208;H bonds were evaluated with diazo reactants to produce a total of 20 new POSS compounds. Novel diazo compounds containing a fluorinated octyl group and boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) chromophore demonstrate the use of highly functionalized substrates. Transformations of aryl(ester)&#8208;functionalized POSS compounds derived from this method are demonstrated, including ester hydrolysis and Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling.</dc:description>

         <title>Metathesis by partner interchange in &#963;&#8208;bond ligands: expanding applications of the &#963;&#8208;CAM mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In 2007 two of us defined the &#963;&#8208;Complex Assisted Metathesis mechanism (Perutz and Sabo&#8208;Etienne,  Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.  2007  ,  46  , 2578&#8208;2592),  i.e.  the &#963;&#8208;CAM concept. This new approach to reaction mechanisms brought together metathesis reactions involving the formation of a variety of metal&#8208;element bonds through partner&#8208;interchange of &#963;&#8208;bond complexes. The key concept that defines a &#963;&#8208;CAM process is a  single  transition state for metathesis that is connected by two intermediates that are &#963;&#8208;bond complexes while the oxidation state of the metal remains constant in precursor, intermediates and product. This mechanism is appropriate in situations where &#963;&#8208;bond complexes have been isolated or computed as well&#8208;defined minima. Unlike several other mechanisms, it does not define the nature of the transition state. In this review, we highlight advances in the characterization and dynamic rearrangements of &#963;&#8208;bond complexes, most notably alkane and zincane complexes, but also different geometries of silane and borane complexes. We set out a selection of catalytic and stoichiometric examples of the &#963;&#8208;CAM mechanism that are supported by strong experimental and/or computational evidence. We then draw on these examples to demonstrate that the scope of the &#963;&#8208;CAM mechanism has expanded to classes of reaction not envisaged in 2007 (additional s&#8208;bond ligands, agostic complexes, sp  2  &#8208;carbon, surfaces). Finally, we provide a critical comparison to alternative mechanisms for metathesis of metal&#8208;element bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoswitchable Nitrogen Superbases: Using Light for Reversible Carbon Dioxide Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using light as an external stimulus to alter the reactivity of Lewis bases is an intriguing tool for controlling chemical reactions. Reversible photoreactions associated with pronounced reactivity changes are particularly valuable in this regard. We herein report the first photoswitchable nitrogen superbases based on guanidines equipped with a dithienylethene photochromic unit. The resulting N&#8208;heterocyclic imines (NHIs) undergo reversible, near quantitative electrocyclic isomerization upon successive exposure to UV and visible irradiation, as demonstrated over multiple cycles. Switching between the ring&#8208;opened and ring&#8208;closed states is accompanied by substantial pKa shifts of the NHIs by up to 8.7 units. Since only the ring&#8208;closed isomers are sufficiently basic to activate CO2 via the formation of zwitterionic Lewis base adducts, cycling between the two isomeric states enables the light&#8208;controlled capture and release of CO2.</dc:description>

         <title>Mapping the regioisomeric space and visible color range of purely organic dual emitters with ultralong phosphorescence components: From violet to red towards pure white&#8208;light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuning the room&#8208;temperature photoluminescence over the whole visible spectrum towards white light emission based on purely organic dual emitters has not been reported yet. In this contribution, we mapped the entire visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum (from violet to red) and even achieved white light emission (CIE: 0.31, 0.34) by combining the intrinsic ns&#8208;fluorescence with ultralong ms&#8208;phosphorescence from purely organic dual emitters. Hence, we realized small molecular materials showing high photoluminescence quantum yields in the solid state at room temperature, which was achieved by active exploration of the regioisomeric substitution space. Chromophore stacking&#8208;supported stabilization of triplet excitons with assistance from enhanced intersystem crossing channels in the neat crystalline state was found to play the primary role for the ultra&#8208;long phosphorescence. The present study includes two main advancements: firstly, it provides an easy strategy to cover the entire visible spectrum, based on organic phosphorescent emitters with versatile regioisomeric substitution patterns. Secondly, this study provides a single molecular source of white light with a strikingly long lifetime (up to 163.5 ms) for the phosphorescent component, as well as remarkably high overall photoluminescence quantum yields reaching up to &#934; L = 20%. Such features have been rarely reported for purely organic compounds and provide a crucial platform to design the next generation of sustainable luminophores with advanced applications spanning from multimodal bioimaging and sensing to advanced optoelectronics, without the need for scarce elements such as Ru, Os, Rh, Ir, Pd or Pt.</dc:description>

         <title>Stacked but not Stuck: Unveiling the Role of &#960; &#8594; &#960;* Interactions with the Help of the Benzofuran&#8208;Formaldehyde Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>

A joint &#8220;rotational spectroscopy &#8208; quantum chemistry&#8221; strategy unveiled the dominant role of  &#960;  &#8594;  &#960;  * interactions in tuning the intermolecular interactions of such adduct. The exploration of the intermolecular potential energy surface led to the identification of 14 low&#8208;energy minima, with 4 stacked isomers being more stable than those linked by hydrogen bond or lone&#8208;pair&#8594;  &#960;  interactions. All energy minima are separated by loose transition states, thus suggesting an effective relaxation to the global minimum under the experimental conditions. This expectation has been confirmed by the experimental detection of only one species, which was unambiguously assigned owing to the computation of accurate spectroscopic parameters and the characterization of 11 isotopologues. The large number of isotopic species opened the way to the determination of the first semi&#8208;experimental equilibrium structure for a molecular complex of such a dimension.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive C&#8722;Ge Coupling of Aryl/Alkenyl Electrophiles with Chlorogermanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cross&#8208;electrophile coupling has emerged as a promising tool for molecular synthesis; however, current studies have focused mainly on forging the C&#8211;C bonds. Herein, we report a cross&#8208;electrophile C&#8211;Ge coupling reaction and thereby demonstrate the possibility of constructing organogermanes from carbon electrophiles and chlorogermanes.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cross-electrophile coupling has emerged as a promising tool for molecular synthesis; however, current studies have focused mainly on forging the C&#8211;C bonds. Herein, we report a cross-electrophile C&#8211;Ge coupling reaction and thereby demonstrate the possibility of constructing organogermanes from carbon electrophiles and chlorogermanes. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions and offers access to both aryl and alkenyl germanes. Electron-rich, electron-poor, and ortho-/meta-/para-substituted (hetero)aryl electrophiles, as well as cyclic and acyclic alkenyl electrophiles, were coupled well. Gram-scale reaction, incorporation of the &#8211;GeR  3  moiety into complex biologically active molecules, and derivatization of formed organogermanes are demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization of a Macrobicyclic Olefin bearing a Sacrificial Silyloxide Bridge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) has been regarded as a powerful tool for sequence&#8208;controlled polymerization. However, the traditional entropy&#8208;driven ROMP of macrocyclic olefins suffers from the lack of ring strain and poor regio&#8208;selectivity, whereas the relay&#8208;ring closing metathesis polymerization inevitably brings some unnecessary auxiliary structure into each monomeric unit. Here we develop a macrobicyclic olefin system bearing a sacrificial silyloxide bridge on the &#945;,&#946;&#8217;&#8208;positions of the double bond, as a new class of sequence&#8208;defined monomer for regio&#8208;selective ROMP. The monomeric sequence information is implanted in the macro&#8208;ring, while the small ring, a 3&#8208;substituted cyclooctene structure with a substantial ring tension, can provide not only narrow polydispersity, but also high regio/stereo&#8208;specificity. Besides, the silyloxide bridge can be sacrificially cleaved by desilylation and deoxygenation reactions to provide clean&#8208;structured, non&#8208;auxiliaried polymers.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Beryllium, an s&#8208;block element, forms an aromatic network of delocalized Be&#8208;Be &#960; bonds in alloys ZrBe2 and HfBe2. This gives rise to a structure that fits description as stacked [Be2]4&#8208; layers with tetravalent cations in between. The [Be2]4&#8208; sublattice is isoelectronic and isostructural to graphite, as well as the [B]&#8208;2 sublattice in MgB2, and it bears identical manifestations of &#960; bonding in its electronic band structure. These come in the form of degeneracies at K and H in the Brillouin zone, separated in energy as the result of interlayer orbital interactions. Zr and Hf use their valence d orbitals to form bonds with the layers, leading to nearly identical band structures. Like MgB2, ZrBe2 and HfBe2 are computed to be phonon&#8208;mediated superconductors at ambient pressures, with respective critical temperatures of 11.4 K and 8.8 K. The coupling strength between phonons and free electrons is very similar, so that the difference in critical temperatures is controlled by the mass of constituent interlayer ions.</dc:description>

         <title>Continuous Porous Aromatic Framework Membranes with Modifiable Sites for Optimized Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Continuous microporous membranes are widely studied for gas separation, due to their low energy premium and strong molecular specificity. Porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) with their exceptional stability and structural flexibility are suited to a wide range of separations. Main&#8208;stream PAF&#8208;based membranes are usually prepared with polymeric matrices, but their discrete entities and boundary defects weaken their selectivity and permeability. The synthesis of continuous PAF membranes is still a major challenge because PAFs are insoluble. Herein, we successfully synthesized a continuous PAF membrane for gas separation. Both pore size and chemistry of the PAF membrane were modified by ion&#8208;exchange, resulting in good selectivity and permeance for the gas mixtures H  2  /N  2  and CO  2  /N  2  . The membrane with Br  &#8208;  as a counter ion in the framework exhibited a H  2  /N  2  selectivity of 72.7 with a H  2  permeance of 51844 gas permeation units (GPU). When the counter ions were replaced by BF  4  &#8208;  , the membrane showed a CO  2  permeance of 23058 GPU, and an optimized CO  2  /N  2  selectivity of 60.0. Our results show that continuous PAF membranes with modifiable pores are promising for various gas separation situations.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly ethylene&#8208;selective electrocatalytic CO2 reduction enabled by isolated Cu&#8208;S motifs in metal&#8208;organic framework&#8208;based precatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper&#8208;based material is an efficient electrocatalyst for CO2 conversion to C2+ products, most of which will reconstruct to in&#8208;situ regenerate active species. It is a challenge to precisely design precatalyst to obtain active sites for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Herein, we develop a local sulfur doping strategy over the Cu&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks precatalyst that disperses stable Cu&#8208;S motif in the framework of HKUST&#8208;1 (S&#8208;HKUST&#8208;1). The precatalyst exhibits a high ethylene selectivity in H&#8208;type cell with maximum faradaic efficiency (FE) of 60.0%, and delivers a current density of 400 mA cm&#8208;2 with ethylene FE to 57.2% in a flow cell. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption results demonstrate that Cu&#948;+ species stabilized by Cu&#8208;S motif exist in S&#8208;HKUST&#8208;1 during CO2RR. Density functional theory calculations indicate the partially oxidized Cu&#948;+ at Cu/CuxSy interface is favorable for *CO intermediate coupling due to the modest distance of coupling sites and optimized adsorption energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Responsive Interfacial Assemblies Based on Charge&#8208;Transfer Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Charge transfer (CT) interactions have been widely used to construct supramolecular systems, such as functional nanostructures and gels. However, to date, there is no report on the generation of CT complexes at the liquid&#8208;liquid interface. Here, by using an electron&#8208;deficient acceptor dissolved in water and an electron&#8208;rich donor dissolved in oil, we present the in&#8208;situ formation and assembly of CT complex surfactants (CTCSs) at the oil&#8208;water interface. With time, CTCSs can assemble into higher ordered nanofilms with exceptional mechanical properties, allowing the stabilization of liquids and, offering the possibility to structure liquids into nonequilibrium shapes. Moreover, due to the redox&#8208;responsiveness of the electron&#8208;deficient acceptor, the association and dissociation of CTCSs can be reversibly manipulated in a redox process, leading to the switchable assembly and disassembly of the resultant constructs.</dc:description>

         <title>Labile photo&#8208;induced free radical in alpha&#8208;ketoglutaric acid: a universal endogenous polarizing agent for in vivo hyperpolarized 13C magnetic resonance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hyperpolarized (HP)  13  C magnetic resonance enables non&#8208;invasive probing of metabolism in vivo. To date, only  13  C&#8208;molecules hyperpolarized with persistent trityl radicals have been injected in humans. We show here that the free radical photo&#8208;induced in alpha&#8208;ketoglutaric acid (&#945;&#8208;KG) can be used to hyperpolarize photo&#8208;inactive  13  C&#8208;molecules such as [1&#8208;  13  C]lactate. &#945;&#8208;KG is an endogenous molecule with an exceptionally high radical yield under photo&#8208;irradiation, up to 50%, and its breakdown product, succinic acid, is also endogenous. This radical precursor therefore exhibits an excellent safety profile for translation to human studies. The labile nature of the radical means that no filtration is required prior to injection while also offering the opportunity to extend the  13  C relaxation time in frozen HP  13  C&#8208;molecules for storage and transport. The potential for in vivo metabolic studies is demonstrated in the rat liver following the injection of a physiological dose of HP [1&#8208;  13  C]lactate.</dc:description>

The labile nature of the radical means that no filtration is required prior to injection while also offering the opportunity to extend the  13  C relaxation time in frozen HP  13  C-molecules for storage and transport. The potential for in vivo metabolic studies is demonstrated in the rat liver following the injection of a physiological dose of HP [1-  13  C]lactate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiroptical Switching and Quantitative Chirality Sensing with (Pseudo)halogenated Quinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report that (pseudo)halogenated quinones react with chiral amines, amino alcohols and amino acids toward push&#8208;pull conjugates with distinctive chiroptical properties amenable to new sensing and switching applications. Strong circular dichroism (CD) signals are induced that allow determination of the absolute configuration and enantiomeric ratio (er) of the chiral target molecules. At the same time, UV changes are observed that can be directly correlated to the total concentration of both enantiomers. The sensing reactions are fast, proceed without by&#8208;product formation at room temperature, tolerate a variety of solvents, and are insensitive to moisture. A work&#8208;up free chirality sensing protocol that is broadly applicable as demonstrated with more than thirty aliphatic and aromatic target compounds, operationally simple while much faster&#160;than traditional chromatographic methods was developed. The absolute error margin of the simultaneous concentration and er analysis is within a few percent which is demonstrated with 20 nonracemic samples. In addition, the chiroptically active push&#8208;pull conjugates can serve as redox switches between two reversibly interconverting states. The addition of sodium borohydride generates a hydroquinone which is quantitatively re&#8208;oxidized to the original quinone upon exposure to air. The corresponding redox couple has remarkably different UV and CD signatures and the switching coincides with a stark colorimetric change. This chiroptical quinone/hydroquinone redox system combines attractive features such as simple set&#8208;up, use of inexpensive chemicals, short response time, thermal and photochemical stability, and it shows no sign of signal decay after three redox cycles. A conceptually new approach that is based on integrated chiroptical sensing and redox switching enables on&#8208;the&#8208;fly spectral deconvolution of otherwise overlapping CD spectra and is used for unprecedented er analysis of challenging samples containing constitutional isomers.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective Access to Axially Chiral Olefins via C&#8208;H Bond Activation and Directing Group Migration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Axially chiral open&#8208;chain olefins represent an underexplored class of chiral platform. In this report, two classes of tetrasubstituted axially chiral acyclic olefins have been accessed in excellent enantioselectivity and regioselectivity via C&#8208;H activation of (hetero)arenes assisted by a migratable directing group en route to coupling with sterically hindered alkynes. The coupling of indoles bearing an N&#8208;aminocarbonyl directing group afforded C&#8208;N axially chiral acrylamides with assistance of a racemic zinc carboxylate additive. DFT studies suggest a &#946;&#8208;nitrogen elimination&#8208;reinsertion pathway for the directing group migration. Meanwhile, the employment of N&#8208;phenoxycarboxamide delivered C&#8208;C axially chiral enamides via migration of the oxidizing directing group. Experimental studies suggest that in both cases the (hetero)arene substrate adopts a well&#8208;defined orientation during the C&#8208;H activation, which in turn determines the disposition of alkyne in migratory insertion. Synthetic applications of representative chiral olefins have been demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetraaryldiborane(4) Can Emit Dual Fluorescence Responding to the Structural Change around the B&#8211;B Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the successful synthesis of tetramesityldiborane(4) (Mes  4  B  2  ) through the reductive coupling of a dimesitylborinium ion. Due to the steric protection conferred by the mesityl groups, Mes  4  B  2  shows exceptional chemical stability and remains intact in water. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed that Mes  4  B  2  has an orthogonal geometry, where the B&#8211;B center is completely hidden by the mesityl groups. Remarkably, Mes  4  B  2  emits dual fluorescence at 460 and 620 nm, both in solution and in the solid state. Theoretical calculations showed that Mes  4  B  2  in the excited S  1  state adopts a twisted or planar geometry, which is responsible for the shorter&#8208; or longer&#8208;wavelength fluorescence, respectively. The intensity ratio of the dual fluorescence is sensitive to the viscosity of the medium, which suggests that Mes  4  B  2  has potential as a ratiometric viscosity sensor.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing the Side&#8208;Chain&#8208;Dependent Ordering Transition of Highly Crystalline Double&#8208;Cable Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When switching the alky linkers from C12H24 to C16H32 in double&#8208;cable conjugated polymers, perylene bisimide side units exhibited order phase transition from disordered structures to ordered H&#8208;aggregation, which is strongly correlated to the photovoltaic performance in single&#8208;component organic solar cells.







Abstract
We developed a series of highly crystalline double&#8208;cable conjugated polymers for application in single&#8208;component organic solar cells (SCOSCs). These polymers contain conjugated backbones as electron donor and pendant perylene bisimide units (PBIs) as electron acceptor. PBIs are connected to the backbone via alkyl units varying from hexyl (C6H12) to eicosyl (C20H40) as flexible linkers. For double&#8208;cable polymers with short linkers, the PBIs tend to stack in a head&#8208;to&#8208;head fashion, resulting in large d&#8208;spacings (e.g. 64&#8197;&#197; for the polymer P12 with C12H24 linker) along the lamellar stacking direction. When the length of the linker groups is longer than a certain length, the PBIs instead adopt a more ordered packing likely via H&#8208;aggregation, resulting in short d&#8208;spacings (e.g. 50&#8197;&#197; for the polymer P16 with C16H32 linker). This work highlights the importance of linker length on the molecular packing of the acceptor units and the influences on the photovoltaic performance of SCOSCs.

&lt;p&gt;When switching the alky linkers from C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt; in double-cable conjugated polymers, perylene bisimide side units exhibited order phase transition from disordered structures to ordered &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-aggregation, which is strongly correlated to the photovoltaic performance in single-component organic solar cells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We developed a series of highly crystalline double-cable conjugated polymers for application in single-component organic solar cells (SCOSCs). These polymers contain conjugated backbones as electron donor and pendant perylene bisimide units (PBIs) as electron acceptor. PBIs are connected to the backbone via alkyl units varying from hexyl (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;) to eicosyl (C&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;) as flexible linkers. For double-cable polymers with short linkers, the PBIs tend to stack in a head-to-head fashion, resulting in large &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-spacings (e.g. 64&#8197;&#197; for the polymer P12 with C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt; linker) along the lamellar stacking direction. When the length of the linker groups is longer than a certain length, the PBIs instead adopt a more ordered packing likely via &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-aggregation, resulting in short &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-spacings (e.g. 50&#8197;&#197; for the polymer P16 with C&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt; linker). This work highlights the importance of linker length on the molecular packing of the acceptor units and the influences on the photovoltaic performance of SCOSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stepwise Generation of Mono&#8208;, Di&#8208;, and Triply&#8208;Reduced Warped Nanographenes: Charge&#8208;Dependent Aromaticity, Surface Nonequivalence, Swing Distortion, and Metal Binding Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stepwise chemical reduction of a molecular warped nanographene (WNG, 1) with Cs metal affords the mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and triply&#8208;reduced nanosized carbanions. In&#8208;depth X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and comprehensive theoretical investigations of this series of negatively charged nanographenes reveal a very complex response and core flexibility upon multi&#8208;electron charging.







Abstract
The stepwise chemical reduction of a molecular warped nanographene (WNG) having a negatively curved &#960;&#8208;surface and defined C80H30 composition with Cs metal used as the reducing and complexing agent allowed the isolation of three different reduced states with one, two, and three electrons added to its &#960;&#8208;conjugated system. This provided a unique series of nanosized carbanions with increasing negative charge for in&#8208;depth structural analysis of consequences of controlled electron charging of non&#8208;planar nanographenes, using X&#8208;ray crystallographic and computational tools. The 3D molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) maps identified the negative charge localization at the central part of the WNG surface where selective coordination of Cs+ ions is confirmed crystallographically. In&#8208;depth theoretical investigation revealed a complex response of the WNG to the stepwise electron acquisition. The extended and contorted &#960;&#8208;surface of the WNG undergoes subtle swinging distortions that are accompanied by notable changes in the electronic structure and site&#8208;dependent aromaticity of the resulting carbanions.

         <title>A Low&#8208;Strain Phosphate Cathode for High&#8208;Rate and Ultralong Cycle&#8208;Life Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;strain phosphate cathode material K3(VO)(HV2O3)(PO4)2(HPO4) (KVP) nanorulers is synthesized by a facile solvothermal approach. The KVP nanorulers manifest high discharge voltage, superior rate capability, and ultralong cyclic life as a cathode material for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs). This work would provide guidance to exploit high&#8208;performance PIB cathode materials.







Abstract
Most potassium&#8208;ion battery (PIB) cathode materials have deficient structural stability because of the huge radius of potassium ion, leading to inferior cycling performance. We report the controllable synthesis of a novel low&#8208;strain phosphate material K3(VO)(HV2O3)(PO4)2(HPO4) (denoted KVP) nanorulers as an efficient cathode for PIBs. The as&#8208;synthesized KVP nanoruler cathode exhibits an initial reversible capacity of 80.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 under 20&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a large average working potential of 4.11&#8197;V. It also manifests an excellent rate property of 54.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 under 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a high capacity preservation of 92.1&#8201;% over 2500&#8197;cycles. The outstanding potassium storage capability of KVP nanoruler cathode originates from a low&#8208;strain K+ uptake/removal mechanism, inherent semiconductor characteristic, and small K+ migration energy barrier. The high energy density and prolonged cyclic stability of KVP nanorulers//polyaniline&#8208;intercalated layered titanate full battery verifies the superiority of KVP nanoruler cathode in PIBs.

         <title>Reactions of a Dilithiomethane with CO and N2O: An Avenue to an Anionic Ketene and a Hexafunctionalized Benzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dianion [(Ph2P(S))2CLi2(THF)]2 1 reacts with CO affording C&#8722;C bond formation and Ph2P(S)&#8208;fragment migration. Subsequent reaction with N2O cleaves a P&#8722;C bond generating an anionic ketene&#8208;derivative which cyclotrimerizes to give the hexa&#8208;substituted benzene derivative, [Ph2P(S)COLi(THF)2]3 6 regioselectively. The experimental observations are rationalized by a detailed theoretical study of the reaction mechanism by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art DFT methods.







Abstract
Synthesis of value&#8208;added products from simple C1 feedstocks is an attractive alternative avenue to traditional fossil fuels. Hexa&#8208;substituted benzene derivatives are highly useful molecules but are often challenging to prepare. Herein, we report that the lithium complex [(Ph2P(S))2CLi2(THF)]2 1 reacts with CO lead to C&#8722;C bond formation and migration of a Ph2P(S)&#8208;fragment affording 2. Subsequent reaction with N2O results in oxidative cleavage of a P&#8722;C bond affording [Ph2P(S)OLi(THF)2]2 4 and the anionic ketene&#8208;derivative Ph2P(S)CCOLi(THF)2 5. Heating 5 prompts cyclotrimerization giving the hexa&#8208;substituted benzene derivative [Ph2P(S)CCOLi(THF)2]3 6 regioselectively. This transition metal&#8208;free protocol to a hexa&#8208;substituted benzene is viable on a gram scale and permits the incorporation of 13C labels. The mechanisms of these reactions are detailed via extensive DFT computations.

         <title>Block Copolymers Based on Ethylene and Methacrylates Using a Combination of Catalytic Chain Transfer Polymerisation (CCTP) and Radical Polymerisation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic chain transfer polymerisation was used to produce methacrylic macromonomers. Those were involved in a simple radical polymerisation of ethylene to form block copolymers featuring a polyethylene segment and various polymethacrylic segments.







Abstract
Two scalable polymerisation methods are used in combination for the synthesis of ethylene and methacrylate block copolymers. &#969;&#8208;Unsaturated methacrylic oligomers (MMAn) produced by catalytic chain transfer (co)polymerisation (CCTP) of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and methacrylic acid (MAA) are used as reagents in the radical polymerisation of ethylene (E) in dimethyl carbonate solvent under relatively mild conditions (80&#8197;bar, 70&#8201;&#176;C). Kinetic measurements and analyses of the produced copolymers by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques indicate that MMAn is involved in a degradative chain transfer process resulting in the formation of (MMA)n&#8208;b&#8208;PE block copolymers. Molecular modelling performed by DFT supports the overall reactivity scheme and observed selectivities. The effect of MMAn molar mass and composition is also studied. The block copolymers were characterised by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and their bulk behaviour studied by SAXS/WAXS analysis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two scalable polymerisation methods are used in combination for the synthesis of ethylene and methacrylate block copolymers. &#969;-Unsaturated methacrylic oligomers (MMA&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) produced by catalytic chain transfer (co)polymerisation (CCTP) of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and methacrylic acid (MAA) are used as reagents in the radical polymerisation of ethylene (E) in dimethyl carbonate solvent under relatively mild conditions (80&#8197;bar, 70&#8201;&#176;C). Kinetic measurements and analyses of the produced copolymers by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques indicate that MMA&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is involved in a degradative chain transfer process resulting in the formation of (MMA)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;-b-PE block copolymers. Molecular modelling performed by DFT supports the overall reactivity scheme and observed selectivities. The effect of MMA&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; molar mass and composition is also studied. The block copolymers were characterised by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and their bulk behaviour studied by SAXS/WAXS analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Selective Photolysis of Phosphonium Iodide Salts for Monofluoromethylations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple and selective synthesis of fluoromethylated alkenes, heterocycles, enamines and heteroarenes by using the readily available and bench&#8208;stable fluoromethylphosphonium iodide salts is described. Key to this privileged transformation is the formation of a photoactive charge&#8208;transfer complex involving the &#963;&#8208;hole effect of phosphonium salts.







Abstract
The sigma (&#963;)&#8208;hole effect has emerged as a promising tool to construct novel architectures endowed with new properties. A simple yet effective strategy for the generation of monofluoromethyl radicals is a continuing challenge within the synthetic community. Fluoromethylphosphonium salts are easily available, air&#8208; and thermally stable, as well as simple&#8208;to&#8208;handle. Herein, we report the ability of the &#963;&#8208;hole effect to facilitate the visible&#8208;light&#8208;triggered photolysis of phosphonium iodide salts, a charge&#8208;transfer complex, selectively giving fluoromethyl radicals. The usefulness and versatility of this new protocol are demonstrated through the mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and trifluoromethylation of a variety of alkenes.

         <title>Elimination of Grain Boundary Defects in Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework ZIF&#8208;95 Membrane via Solvent&#8208;Free Secondary Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208;free secondary growth is developed for facile synthesis of highly oriented and well&#8208;intergrown ZIF&#8208;95 membranes. The solvent&#8208;free secondary growth is not only helpful to control the membrane microstructure and thickness, but also reduce solvent&#8208;induced intercrystalline defects, leading to a significant enhancement of the H2 permselectivity for the separation of hydrogen from larger gas molecules compared to solvothermal synthesis.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework membranes are usually prepared by in situ or secondary growth in a solution/hydrogel. The use of organic solvents may cause safety and environmental problems and produce solvent&#8208;induced defects. Here, highly oriented and permselective ZIF&#8208;95 membranes are prepared for the first time via a solvent&#8208;free secondary growth method. The solvent&#8208;free growth is not only helpful to control the membrane microstructure and thickness, but also to reduce the intercrystalline defects. In case of solvent&#8208;free growth, a perfectly oriented structure leads to an outstanding reduction of intercrystalline defects and transport resistances. For the separation of equimolar binary gas mixtures by using the highly oriented ZIF&#8208;95 membrane at 25&#8201;&#176;C and 1&#8197;bar, the mixture separation factors of H2/CO2 and H2/CH4 are 184 and 140, respectively, with H2 permeance of over 1.9&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;mol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;Pa&#8722;1 which are much higher than those of the randomly oriented ZIF&#8208;95 membrane.

         <title>Phenylimino Indolinone: A Green&#8208;Light&#8208;Responsive T&#8208;Type Photoswitch Exhibiting Negative Photochromism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive T&#8208;type photoswitches with negative photochromism are rare and interesting candidates for a wide range of applications. Here, we describe the computer&#8208;assisted rational design of phenylimino indolinone (PIO) and its characterization in the ground and excited state using the full toolbox of physical organic chemistry.







Abstract
Imines are photoaddressable motifs useful in the development of new generations of molecular switches, but their operation with low&#8208;energy photons and control over isomer stability remain challenging. Based on a computational design, we developed phenylimino indolinone (PIO), a green&#8208;light&#8208;addressable T&#8208;type photoswitch showing negative photochromism. The isomerization behavior of this photoactuator of the iminothioindoxyl (ITI) class was studied using time&#8208;resolved spectroscopies on time scales from femtoseconds to the steady state and by quantum&#8208;chemical analyses. The understanding of the isomerization properties and substituent effects governing these photoswitches opens new avenues for the development of novel T&#8208;type visible&#8208;light&#8208;addressable photoactuators based on C=N bonds.

         <title>Dual&#8208;targeting Circular Aptamer Strategy Enabled Recognition of Different Leukemia Cells with Enhanced Binding Ability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, the broad use of monovalent aptamers in oncology faces challenges, including insufficient recognition and internalization caused by finite unitary receptors, as well as confined recognition spectrum. Herein, we describe the development of a dual&#8208;targeting circular aptamer (DTCA) that can recognize two different biomarkers on living cells to augment aptamer&#8208;receptor interactions, thus allowing the enhanced recognition event to occur. This improvement not only boosts binding and internalization abilities, but also expands the recognition spectrum for different leukemia cells. Moreover, the stability of DTCA in serum can be significantly improved by an enzyme&#8208;promoted terminal ligation strategy. The chemical incorporation of 5&#8208;fluorodeoxyuridine into DTCA resulted in a pharmaceutically functional aptamer that exhibited excellent selectivity, as demonstrated by its high cytotoxicity against target cancer cells, but not to normal cells. The superiority of our newly developed strategy was further highlighted by its precise tumor imaging capability.</dc:description>

         <title>Desulfonative Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Coupling of Sulfonyl Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aryl sulfonyl fluorides, typically inert to transition metal catalysis, undergo a Pd&#8208;catalyzed desulfonative Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling. The reaction can occur without added base and turns the &#8722;SO2F group into a divergent handle for C&#8722;C or S&#8722;Nu coupling.







Abstract
Sulfonyl fluorides have emerged as powerful &#8220;click&#8221; electrophiles to access sulfonylated derivatives. Yet, they are relatively inert towards C&#8722;C bond forming transformations, notably under transition&#8208;metal catalysis. Here, we describe conditions under which aryl sulfonyl fluorides act as electrophiles for the Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling. This desulfonative cross&#8208;coupling occurs selectively in the absence of base and, unusually, even in the presence of strong acids. Divergent one&#8208;step syntheses of two analogues of bioactive compounds showcase the expanded reactivity of sulfonyl fluorides to encompass both S&#8722;Nu and C&#8722;C bond formation. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations suggest oxidative addition occurs at the C&#8722;S bond followed by desulfonation to form a Pd&#8208;F intermediate that facilitates transmetalation.

Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations suggest oxidative addition occurs at the C&#8722;S bond followed by desulfonation to form a Pd-F intermediate that facilitates transmetalation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stabilization of the Elusive Antimony(I) Cation and Its Coordination Complexes with Transition Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The elusive SbI cation has been stabilized by the 5,6&#8208;bis(diisopropylphosphino)acenaphthene ligand (see structure). The bis(phosphine) not only acts as a supporting ligand, but also enables the unique two&#8208;electron reduction of the SbIII precursor in the presence of trimethylsilyl triflate, leading to SbI cation. The strategically introduced nucleophilicity at the SbI site enabled the first examples of its coordination to transition metals.







Abstract
Upon stabilization by 5,6&#8208;bis(diisopropylphosphino)acenaphthene to form compound 1, the fugitive antimony (I) cation exhibited nucleophilic behavior towards coinage metals. Compound 1 was strategically synthesized at room temperature from SbCl3, the bis(phosphine), and trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate taken in a 1:2:3 ratio, whereby the bis(phosphine) plays the dual role of a reductant and a supporting ligand. The generation of 1 involves two&#8208;electron oxidation of the ligand to form a P&#8722;P bonded diphosphonium dication. Compound 1 was separated from this dication to give both products in pure form in moderate yields. Despite the overall positive charge, the SbI site in 1 was found to bind to metal centers, forming complexes with AuI, AgI and CuI. Compound 1 reduced CuII to CuI and formed a coordination complex with the resulting CuI species. The effects of the electron&#8208;rich bis(phosphine) and the constrained peri geometry in stabilizing and enhancing the nucleophilicity of 1 have been rationalized through computational studies.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure and Reactivity of a Cyapho&#8208;Cyanamide Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe the step&#8208;wise synthesis of the novel cyapho&#8208;cyanamide ion, [N(CN)(CP)]&#8722;, obtained by the reaction of sodium phosphanide, Na(PH2), with dimethyl N&#8208;cyanocarbonimidate, (MeO)2C=N(CN). Preliminary reactions of the ion with electrophiles reveal the cyclisation reactions are available on functionalisation.







Abstract
We describe a facile synthesis of the cyapho&#8208;cyanamide salt [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][N(CN)(CP)] from reaction of [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][PH2] (18&#8208;crown&#8208;6=1,4,7,10,13,16&#8208;hexaoxacyclooctadecane) with dimethyl N&#8208;cyanocarbonimidate, (MeO)2C=N(CN). The reaction proceeds with elimination of two equivalents of methanol. Careful tuning of the reaction conditions allowed for the isolation and characterization of the N&#8208;cyano(carboximidate)phosphide intermediate [HP{C(OMe)N(CN)}]&#8722;. Due to the adverse effects of methanol in these reaction mixtures, a bulk scale synthesis of [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][N(CN)(CP)] could be achieved by addition of a base (LiHMDS) to neutralize the resulting alcohol. Further reactivity studies of this anion reveal that functionalization at the phosphorus atom is viable to yield a new family of cyanide&#8208;functionalised phosphorus heterocycles.

         <title>Probing Water State during Lipidic Mesophases Phase Transitions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We study the phase transitions from cubic to reverse hexagonal phase in lipidic mesophase at molecular level. The dynamics of both water and lipids, as well as the hydrogen bond network of confined water were monitored during the phase transition. The results demonstrate clear dynamical difference between bound and interstitial water in both phases.







Abstract
We investigate the static and dynamic states of water network during the phase transitions from double gyroid (
) to double diamond (
) bicontinuous cubic phases and from the latter to the reverse hexagonal (HII) phase in monolinolein based lipidic mesophases by combining FTIR and broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS). In both cubic(s) and HII phase, two dynamically different fractions of water are detected and attributed to bound and interstitial free water. The dynamics of the two water fractions are all slower than bulk water due to the hydrogen&#8208;bonds between water molecules and the lipid's polar headgroups and to nanoconfinement. Both FTIR and BDS results suggest that a larger fraction of water is hydrogen&#8208;bonded to the headgroup of lipids in the HII phase at higher temperature than in the cubic phase at lower temperature via H&#8208;bonds, which is different from the common expectation that the number of H&#8208;bonds should decrease with increase of temperature. These findings are rationalized by considering the topological ratio of interface/volume of the two mesophases.

         <title>Deciphering and Suppressing Over&#8208;Oxidized Nitrogen in Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Urea Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic investigation of the nitrogen network during the nickel&#8208;catalyzed urea oxidation reaction was carefully performed. It revealed a dominant NO2&#8722; production rather than innocuous N2 present on various nickel&#8208;based catalysts. Accordingly, polymer&#8208;surface modification was put forward to increase the efficiency of harmless N2 products.







Abstract
Urea electrolysis is a prospective technology for simultaneous H2 production and nitrogen suppression in the process of water being used for energy production. Its sustainability is currently founded on innocuous N2 products; however, we discovered that prevalent nickel&#8208;based catalysts could generally over&#8208;oxidize urea into NO2&#8722; products with &#8776;80&#8201;% Faradaic efficiencies, posing potential secondary hazards to the environment. Trace amounts of over&#8208;oxidized NO3&#8722; and N2O were also detected. Using 15N isotopes and urea analogues, we derived a nitrogen&#8208;fate network involving a NO2&#8722;&#8208;formation pathway via OH&#8722;&#8208;assisted C&#8722;N cleavage and two N2&#8208;formation pathways via intra&#8208; and intermolecular coupling. DFT calculations confirmed that C&#8722;N cleavage is energetically more favorable. Inspired by the mechanism, a polyaniline&#8208;coating strategy was developed to locally enrich urea for increasing N2 production by a factor of two. These findings provide complementary insights into the nitrogen fate in water&#8211;energy nexus systems.

Core&#8211;shell fluorescent polymeric particle were (CS&#8208;FPPs) constructed based on aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) via the stepwise self&#8208;stabilized precipitation (2SP) polymerization, and white light emission of CS&#8208;FPPs was achieved with the CIE1931 coordinate of (0.33, 0.34), which could be simply but effectively tuned by manipulating the aggregation microenvironment of the AIEgens located.

White&#8208;light emitting polymers (WLEPs) based on aggregation microenvironment&#8208;sensitive aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) have aroused great interest in lighting and optoelectronic devices. Herein, we developed a novel strategy to construct WLEP particles via a stepwise self&#8208;stabilized precipitation polymerization of two emission&#8208;complementary AIEgens under core&#8211;shell engineering, where the AIE characteristics and FRET process of core&#8211;shell fluorescent polymeric particles (CS&#8208;FPPs) could be modulated by altering aggregation microenvironment under swelling and shrinking of polymers, facilitating the tunable white light emission of CS&#8208;FPPs. Furthermore, such tuning could be fast realized in the solid state, thus demonstrating the potential in anti&#8208;counterfeiting. This work proved the significance of aggregation microenvironment on emission of luminogens, guiding the development of high&#8208;efficiency emission&#8208;tunable materials.

         <title>Moderate Surface Segregation Promotes Selective Ethanol Production in CO2 Hydrogenation Reaction over CoCu Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cobalt&#8208;copper (CoCu) catalyst is known to have potential industrial application to catalyze CO/CO  2  hydrogenation reactions. And CoCu alloy has been elucidated as major active phase during reactions. However, due to the elemental surface segregation and even dealloying phenomena, the actual surface morphology of CoCu alloy is still unclear. Herein, combining theory and experiment, this paper describes the dual effect of surface segregation and varied CO coverage over CoCu(111) surface on the reactivity in CO  2  hydrogenation reactions. The wrestling relation between C&#8208;O bond scission and further hydrogenation of intermediate *CH  2  O was discovered as the key step to promote ethanol production. The theoretical investigation suggests that moderate Co segregation provides a suitable surface Co ensemble with lateral interactions of co&#8208;adsorbed *CO, leading to promoted selectivity to ethanol, in agreement with theory&#8208;inspired experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Macrocycle Dynamics in a Branched [8]Catenane Controlled by Three Different Stimuli in Three Different Regions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A branched [8]catenane from an efficient one&#8208;pot synthesis (72% HPLC yield, 59% isolated yield) featuring the simultaneous use of three kinds of templates and cucurbit[6]uril&#8208;mediated azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CBAAC) for ring&#8208;closing is reported. Design and assembly of the [8]catenane precursors are unexpectedly complex that can involve cooperating, competing and non&#8208;influencing interactions. Due to the branched structure, dynamics of the [8]catenane can be modulated in different extent by rigidifying/loosening the mechanical bonds at different regions by using solvent polarity, acid&#8208;base and metal ions as the stimuli. This work not only highlights the importance of understanding the delicate interplay of the weak and non&#8208;obvious supramolecular interactions in the synthesis of high&#8208;order [n]catenane, but also demonstrates a complex control of dynamics and flexibility for exploiting [n]catenanes applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Dye&#8208;Triplet&#8208;Sensitized Upconversion Emission Through Heavy Atom Effect in CsLu2F7:Yb/Er Nanoprobes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lanthanide (Ln  3+  )&#8208;doped upconversion (UC) nanoprobes, which have drawn extensive attentions for various bioapplications, usually suffer from small absorption cross&#8208;section and weak luminescence intensity of Ln  3+&#160;  ions. Herein, we report the controlled synthesis of a new class of Ln  3+  &#8208;doped UC nanoprobes based on CsLu  2  F  7  :Yb/Er nanocrystals (NCs), which can effectively increase the intersystem crossing (ISC) efficiency from singlet excited state to triplet excited state of IR808 up to 99.3% through the heavy atom effect. By virtue of the efficient triplet sensitization&#160;of IR808, the optimal UC luminescence (UCL) intensity of IR808&#8208;modified CsLu  2  F  7  :Yb/Er NCs is enhanced by 1309 times upon excitation at 808 nm. The enhancement factor is more than one order of magnitude higher than that based on the well&#8208;established NaYF  4  :Yb/Er NCs. Benefiting from the intense dye&#8208;triplet&#8208;sensitized UCL, the nanoprobes are demonstrated for sensitive assay of extracellular and intracellular hypochlorite with an 808&#8208;nm/980&#8208;nm dual excited ratiometric strategy, thus revealing the great potential of the proposed nanoprobes for monitoring biomolecules and biochemical processes in live cells.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The reactions of  N  &#8208;sulfonylhydrazones derived from cyclic ketones with &#947;&#8208;azidopropylboronic acid and 2&#8208;(azidomethyl)phenyl)boronic acid give rise to spirocyclic pyrrolidines and spiroisoindolines respectively. The reactions proceed without the need of any transition&#8208;metal catalyst through a domino process that comprises the formation of a Csp3&#8208;C and a Csp3&#8208;N bond of the former hydrazonic carbon. The scope of the reaction have been explored by the preparation of over 50 examples of NH&#8208;unprotected spirocyclic derivatives.

         <title>A Modular Approach to the Antifungal Sphingofungin Family: Concise Total Synthesis of Sphingofungin A and C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sphingofungins are fungal natural products known to inhibit the biosynthesis of sphingolipids which play pivotal roles in various cell functions. Here, we report a short and flexible synthetic approach towards the sphingofungin family. Key step of the synthesis was a decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling reaction of chiral sulfinyl imines with a functionalized tartaric acid derivative, which yielded the core motive of sphingofungins carrying four consecutive stereocenters and a terminal double bond. Subsequent metathesis reaction allowed for the introduction of different side chains of choice resulting in a total of eight sphingofungins, including for the first time sphingofungin C (eight steps from commercially available protected tartaric acid with an overall yield of 6%) and sphingofungin A (ten steps). All newly synthesized derivatives were tested for their antifungal, cell proliferative and antiparasitic activity unraveling their structure&#8208;activity relations.</dc:description>

         <title>Hyperbranched Microwire Networks of Organic Cocrystals with Optical Waveguiding and Light&#8208;Harvesting Abilities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of hyperbranched organic microwire (MW) networks comprising 1,4&#8208;bis(pentafluorostyryl)benzene (10Ft) and 9,10&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene (BA) using a simple solution co&#8208;assembly route. Neither pure 10Ft nor BA assemblies can produce such complex MW networks apart from a binary cocrystal of 10Ft and BA with a 2:1 molar ratio ((2:1)10Ft:BA) formed via intermolecular arene&#8208;perfluoroarene (AP) interaction. A new generation of multiple MWs grow epitaxially on the previous generation of MWs to form MW arrays, in which BA may also act as an intermediate product to facilitate the regeneration of (2:1)10Ft:BA. Highly aligned and well&#8208;connected MW networks enable the superior optical waveguiding ability. Moreover, a red&#8208;emitting dopant, 5,12&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)naphthacene (BN) was incorporated into (2:1)10Ft:BA host MWs, giving light&#8208;harvesting hierarchical MW networks via an energy transfer (ET) process. The realization of the hyperbranched MWs provides us a deep insight into the rational creation of complex branched arrays from functional organic cocrystals.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli&#8208;responsive materials that can be reversibly switched by light are of immense interest. Among them, photo&#8208;responsive spin crossover (SCO) complexes have great promises to combine the photoactive inputs with multifaceted outputs into switchable materials and devices. However, the reversible control the spin&#8208;state change by photochromic guests is still challenging. Herein, we report an unprecedented guest&#8208;driven light&#8208;induced spin change (GD&#8208;LISC) in a Hofmann&#8208;type metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), [Fe(bpn){Ag(CN)  2  }  2  ]&#183;azobenzene. (  1  , bpn = 1,4&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)naphthalene). The reversible  trans&#8722;cis  photoisomerization of azobenzene guest upon UV/vis irradiation in the solid state results in the remarkable magnetic changes in a wide temperature range of 10&#8722;180 K. This finding not only establishes a new switching mechanism for SCO complexes, but also paves the way toward the development of new generation of photo&#8208;responsive magnetic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Active exsolved metal&#8208;oxide interfaces in porous single&#8208;crystalline ceria monoliths for efficient and durable CH4/CO2 reforming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dry reforming of CH4/CO2 provides an attractive route to convert greenhouse gas into syngas; however, the resistance to sintering and coking of catalyst remains a fundamental challenge at high operation temperatures. Here we create active and durable metal&#8208;oxide interface in porous single&#8208;crystalline (PSC) CeO2 monoliths with in situ exsolved single&#8208;crystalline (SC) Ni particles and show efficient dry reforming of CH4/CO2 at temperature as low as 450 &#176;C. We show the excellent and durable performance with ~20% of CH4 conversion and ~30% of CO2 conversion even in a continuous operation of 240 hours. The well&#8208;defined active metal&#8208;oxide interfaces, created by exsolving SC Ni nanoparticles from PSC NixCe1&#8208;xO2 to anchor them on PSC CeO2 scaffolds, prevent nanoparticle sintering and enhance the coking resistance due to the stronger metal&#8722;support interactions. Our work would enable an industrially and economically viable path for carbon reclamation, and the technique of creating active and durable metal&#8208;oxide interfaces in PSC monoliths could lead to stable catalyst designs for many challenging reactions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Mn&#8208;based oxides have sparked extensive scientific interest for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries due to the rich abundance, plentiful oxidation states, and high output voltage. However, the further development of Mn&#8208;based oxides is severely hindered by the rapid capacity decay during cycling. Herein, a two&#8208;step metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;engaged templating strategy has been developed to rationally synthesize heterostructured Mn  2  O  3  &#8208;ZnMn  2  O  4  hollow octahedrons (MO&#8208;ZMO HOs) for stable zinc ion storage. The distinctive composition and hollow heterostructure endow MO&#8208;ZMO HOs with abundant active sites, enhanced electric conductivity, and superior structural stability. By virtue of these advantages, the MO&#8208;ZMO HOs electrode shows high reversible capacity, impressive rate performance, and outstanding electrochemical stability. Furthermore, ex situ characterizations reveal that the charge storage of MO&#8208;ZMO HOs mainly originates from the highly reversible Zn  2+  insertion/extraction reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of a Tridecasaccharide Lipooligosaccharide Antigen from the Opportunistic Pathogen Mycobacterium kansasii</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tridecasaccharide glycan domain of lipooligosaccharides from the opportunistic pathogen Mycobacterium kansasii was synthesized. The target (see structure) possesses structural motifs that make its synthesis a formidable challenge, including rare monosaccharides, an asymmetrically substituted trehalose residue and a base&#8208;sensitive amide side chain. The study provides a strategy for synthesizing other members of this unusual class of molecules.







Abstract
The outer surfaces of mycobacteria, including the organism that causes tuberculosis, are decorated with an array of immunomodulatory glycans. Among these are lipooligosaccharides (LOSs), a class of molecules for which the function remains poorly understood. We describe the chemical synthesis of the glycan portion of a tridecasaccharide LOS from the opportunistic pathogen Mycobacterium kansasii. The target contains a number of unusual structural motifs that complicate its assembly and is the most complex mycobacterial LOS glycan to be synthesized to date when considering size and number of unique monosaccharides and glycosidic linkages. These studies not only provide a roadmap for the preparation of additional members of this family of glycans, but also provides a valuable probe for use in structure&#8211;activity relationship investigations.

         <title>Single&#8208;Phase Formation of Rh2O3 Nanoparticles on h&#8208;BN Support for Highly Controlled Methane Partial Oxidation to Syngas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;phase Rh2O3 nanocatalyst is developed by exploiting the stabilization of the (110) plane of the Rh2O3(I) seed on hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) after decomposition of the rhodium precursor. By using the Rh/h&#8208;BN, catalytic methane partial oxidation to syngas was accomplished solely via the direct route.







Abstract
Single&#8208;phase formation of active metal oxides on supports has been vigorously pursued in many catalytic applications to suppress undesired reactions and to determine direct structure&#8208;property relationships. However, this is difficult to achieve in nanoscale range because the effect of non&#8208;uniform metal&#8208;support interfaces becomes dominant in the overall catalyst growth, leading to the nucleation of various metastable oxides. Herein, we develop a supported single&#8208;phase corundum&#8208;Rh2O3(I) nanocatalyst by utilizing controlled interaction between metal oxide and h&#8208;BN support. Atomic&#8208;resolution electron microscopy and first&#8208;principle calculation reveal that single&#8208;phase formation occurs via uniform and preferential attachment of Rh2O3(I) (110) seed planes on well&#8208;defined h&#8208;BN surface after decomposition of rhodium precursor. By utilizing the Rh/h&#8208;BN catalyst in methane partial oxidation, syngas is successfully produced solely following the direct route with keeping a H2/CO ratio of 2, which makes it ideal for most downstream chemical processes.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-phase formation of active metal oxides on supports has been vigorously pursued in many catalytic applications to suppress undesired reactions and to determine direct structure-property relationships. However, this is difficult to achieve in nanoscale range because the effect of non-uniform metal-support interfaces becomes dominant in the overall catalyst growth, leading to the nucleation of various metastable oxides. Herein, we develop a supported single-phase corundum-Rh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(I) nanocatalyst by utilizing controlled interaction between metal oxide and h-BN support. Atomic-resolution electron microscopy and first-principle calculation reveal that single-phase formation occurs via uniform and preferential attachment of Rh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(I) (110) seed planes on well-defined h-BN surface after decomposition of rhodium precursor. By utilizing the Rh/h-BN catalyst in methane partial oxidation, syngas is successfully produced solely following the direct route with keeping a H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO ratio of 2, which makes it ideal for most downstream chemical processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unraveling the Origin of Sulfur&#8208;Doped Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Activity: Effect of Iron Spin&#8208;State Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of sulfur&#8208;doped Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C single&#8208;atom catalysts is studied from Fe spin&#8208;state tuning. Operando 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectra monitoring further supported the low&#8208;spin (LS) single&#8208;Fe3+&#8208;atom of the C&#8208;FeN4&#8208;S moiety as the active site for the ORR.







Abstract
Heteroatom doped atomically dispersed Fe1&#8208;NC catalysts have been found to show excellent activity toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the origin of the enhanced activity is still controversial because the structure&#8208;function relationship governing the enhancement remains elusive. Herein, sulfur(S)&#8208;doped Fe1&#8208;NC catalyst was obtained as a model, which displays a superior activity for ORR towards the traditional Fe&#8208;NC materials. 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that incorporation of S in the second coordination sphere of Fe1&#8208;NC can induce the transition of spin polarization configuration. Operando 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectra definitively identified the low spin single&#8208;Fe3+&#8208;atom of C&#8208;FeN4&#8208;S moiety as the active site for ORR. Moreover, DFT calculations unveiled that lower spin state of the Fe center after the S doping promotes OH* desorption process. This work elucidates the underlying mechanisms towards S doping for enhancing ORR activity, and paves a way to investigate the function of broader heteroatom doped Fe1&#8208;NC catalysts to offer a general guideline for spin&#8208;state&#8208;determined ORR.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of a Dicationic Diazahexabenzocoronene Derivative on the Au(111) Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hexabenzocoronene derivative embedded with graphitic nitrogen in its honeycomb lattice is prepared by on&#8208;surface assisted cyclodehydrogenation on the Au(111) surface. Combined scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy investigations unveil the chemical and electronic structures of the obtained dicationic nanographene.







Abstract
The atomically precise control over the size, shape and structure of nanographenes (NGs) or the introduction of heteroatom dopants into their sp2&#8208;carbon lattice confer them valuable electronic, optical and magnetic properties. Herein, we report on the design and synthesis of a hexabenzocoronene derivative embedded with graphitic nitrogen in its honeycomb lattice, achieved via on&#8208;surface assisted cyclodehydrogenation on the Au(111) surface. Combined scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy investigations unveil the chemical and electronic structures of the obtained dicationic NG. Kelvin probe force microscopy measurements reveal a considerable variation of the local contact potential difference toward lower values with respect to the gold surface, indicative of its positive net charge. Altogether, we introduce the concept of cationic nitrogen doping of NGs on surfaces, opening new avenues for the design of novel carbon nanostructures.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Red Laser with a Single Longitudinal Mode from Carbon Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Red&#8208;emissive carbon dots (CDs) with high PLQY (65.5&#8201;%) were obtained by aliphatic precursors which combining graphitic nitrogen doping and surface modification. A planar microcavity with only one resonant mode, which fitted with the CDs&#8217; amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) peak, was constructed and resulted in a solid&#8208;state laser with a single longitudinal mode, a linewidth of 0.14&#8197;nm and a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio of 14.8&#8197;dB.







Abstract
Miniaturized solid&#8208;state lasers with a single longitudinal mode are vital for various photonic applications. Here we prepare red&#8208;emissive carbon dots (CDs) with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 65.5&#8201;% by combining graphitic nitrogen doping and surface modification. High&#8208;concentration doping alters the CDs&#8217; emission from blue to red, while the electron&#8208;donating groups and polymer coating on their surfaces improve the PLQY and photostability. The CDs exhibit excellent stimulated emission characteristics, with a low threshold of amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) and long gain lifetime. A planar microcavity with only one resonant mode, which fitted with the CDs&#8217; ASE peak, was constructed. Combining the CDs and microcavity produced a solid&#8208;state laser with a single longitudinal mode, a linewidth of 0.14&#8197;nm and a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio of 14.8&#8197;dB (Q&#8764;4600). Our results will aid the development of colorful solid&#8208;state micro/nano lasers with potential use in practical photonics.

         <title>Irradiation&#8208;Wavelength Directing Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Self&#8208;Organized Helical Superstructures Enabled by Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Chiral Fluorescent Molecular Switches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phototuning the turning&#8208;off and the polarization inversion of circularly polarized luminescence signals is obtained in the corresponding photostationary state of the same helical cholesteric superstructure constructed from the light&#8208;driven hydrogen bonded chiral fluorescent molecular switch, which derives from the different conversion ratio of Z/E photoisomerization of the switch upon different light irradiations.







Abstract
Two light&#8208;driven chiral fluorescent molecular switches, (R,S,R)&#8208;switch 1 and (R,S,R)&#8208;switch 2, are prepared by means of hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) assembly of a photoresponsive (S) chiral fluorescent molecule, respectively with a cyano substitution at different positions as an H&#8208;bond acceptor and an opposite (R) chiral molecule as an H&#8208;bond donor. The resulting two switches exhibit tunable and reversible Z/E photoisomerization irradiated with 450&#8197;nm blue and 365&#8197;nm UV light. When doped into an achiral liquid crystal, both switches are found to be able to form a CPL tunable luminescent helical superstructure. In contrast to the tunable CPL characteristics of the system incorporating switch 2, exposure of the system incorporating switch 1 to 365&#8197;nm and 450&#8197;nm radiation can lead to controllable different photostationary CPL behavior, including switching&#8208;off and polarization inversion. In addition, optical information coding is demonstrated using the system containing switch 1.

         <dc:description>P&#8208;stereogenic tert&#8208; and sec&#8208;phosphines have wide applications in asymmetric catalysis, materials, and pharmaceutical chemistry, however, their practical synthesis still constitutes a significant challenge. Herein, a successful kinetic resolution of rac&#8208;secondary phosphine oxides via the enantioselective P&#8208;benzylation process catalyzed by the palladium/Xiao&#8208;Phos was designed. Both tert&#8208; and sec&#8208;phosphine oxides were delivered in good yield and excellent enantiopurity (selectivity factor up to 226.1). The appealing synthetic utilities are further demonstrated by the facile preparation of several valuable P&#8208;chiral compounds, precursors of bidentate ligands, as well as transition metal complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Unexpected Formation of Metallofulleroids from Multicomponent Reactions, with Crystallographic and Computational Studies of the Cluster Motion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various metallofulleroids were generated from a new isocyanide&#8208;induced multicomponent reaction on clusterfullerenes. One ketenimine metallofulleroid has fixed Lu3N cluster due to the presence of the nearby organic appendant from a neighbor molecule in the solid state.







Abstract
New multicomponent reactions involving an isocyanide, terminal or internal alkynes, and endohedral metallofullerene (EMF) Lu3N@C80 yield metallofulleroids which are characterized by mass&#8208;spectrometry, HPLC, and multiple 1D and 2D NMR techniques. Single crystal studies revealed one ketenimine metallofulleroid has ordered Lu3N cluster which is unusual for EMF monoadducts. Computational analysis, based on crystallographic data, confirm that the endohedral cluster motion is controlled by the position of the exohedral organic appendants. Our findings provide a new functionalization reaction for EMFs, and a potential facile approach to freeze the endohedral cluster motion at relatively high temperatures.

         <title>Smart Tumor&#8208;Cell&#8208;Derived Microparticles Provide On&#8208;Demand Photosensitizer Synthesis and Hypoxia Relief for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accurate co&#8208;localization of PpIX and O2: HAL and 3BP&#8208;loaded microparticles specifically target and recognize tumor cells, wherein HAL induces the biosynthesis of PpIX in mitochondria and 3BP reduces the mitochondria oxygen consumption. The precise co&#8208;localization of PpIX and O2 produces sufficient singlet oxygen to directly disrupt mitochondria, significantly improving PDT.







Abstract
Positioning essential elements of photodynamic therapy (PDT) near to mitochondria can conquer the rigorous spatiotemporal limitations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) transfer and make considerable differences in PDT. However, precise accumulation of photosensitizer (PS) and oxygen within mitochondria is still challenging. We simultaneously encapsulated hexyl 5&#8208;aminolevulinate hydrochloride (HAL) and 3&#8208;bromopyruvic acid (3BP) into microparticles collected from X&#8208;ray&#8208;irradiated tumor cells (X&#8208;MP). After systemic administration, the developed HAL/3BP@X&#8208;MP can specifically target and recognize tumor cells, where HAL induces efficient accumulation of PpIX in mitochondria via the intrinsic haem biosynthetic pathway. Meanwhile, 3BP remarkably increases the oxygen supply by inhibiting mitochondrial respiration. The accurate co&#8208;localization and prompt encounter of PpIX and oxygen produce sufficient ROS to directly disrupt mitochondria, resulting in significantly improved PDT outcomes.

         <title>Enantioselective Construction of Modular and Asymmetric Baskets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stepwise Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling of custom&#8208;built A, B, and C building blocks gives ABC baskets. Such enantioselective and modular construction allows choosing dept and shape of the cavitand's nonpolar pocket while also selecting desired functional groups at the rim. Building more effective mimics of biological receptors and catalysts is within reach.







Abstract
The precise positioning of functional groups about the inner space of abiotic hosts is a challenging task and of interest for developing more effective receptors and catalysts akin to those found in nature. To address it, we herein report a synthetic methodology for preparing basket&#8208;like cavitands comprised of three different aromatics as side arms with orthogonal esters at the rim for further functionalization. First, enantioenriched A (borochloronorbornene), B (iodobromonorbornene), and C (boronorbornene) building blocks were obtained by stereoselective syntheses. Second, consecutive A&#8208;to&#8208;B and then AB&#8208;to&#8208;C Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura (SM) couplings were optimized to give enantioenriched ABC cavitand as the principal product. The robust synthetic protocol allowed us to prepare (a)&#8197;an enantioenriched basket with three benzene sides and each holding either tBu, Et, or Me esters, (b)&#8197;both enantiomers of a so&#8208;called &#8220;spiral staircase&#8221; basket with benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene groups surrounding the inner space, and (c)&#8197;a photo&#8208;responsive basket bearing one anthracene and two benzene arms.

         <title>Studying the Conversion Mechanism to Broaden Cathode Options in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beyond Zn&#8208;ion intercalation, the conversion mechanism for Zn&#8208;ion storage and its diffusion pathway in CuI cathodes were studied. This direct conversion mechanism can be generalized to other high&#8208;capacity cathodes, such as Cu2S (336.7&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1) and Cu2O (374.5&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1), indicating its practical universality, which enriches the Zn2+ storage mechanism and broadens the cathode horizons towards next&#8208;generation ZIBs.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are regarded as alternatives to Li&#8208;ion batteries benefiting from both improved safety and environmental impact. The widespread application of ZIBs, however, is compromised by the lack of high&#8208;performance cathodes. Currently, only the intercalation mechanism is widely reported in aqueous ZIBs, which significantly limits cathode options. Beyond Zn&#8208;ion intercalation, we comprehensively study the conversion mechanism for Zn2+ storage and its diffusion pathway in a CuI cathode, indicating that CuI occurs a direct conversion reaction without Zn2+ intercalation due to the high energy barrier for Zn2+ intercalation and migration. Importantly, this direct conversion reaction mechanism can be readily generalized to other high&#8208;capacity cathodes, such as Cu2S (336.7&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1) and Cu2O (374.5&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1), indicating its practical universality. Our work enriches the Zn&#8208;ion storage mechanism and significantly broadens the cathode horizons towards next&#8208;generation ZIBs.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Diastereodivergent Synthesis of Spirocycles through Dual&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed [3+2] Annulation of 2&#8208;Vinyloxiranes with Nucleophilic Dipoles</title>

         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] annulation of 2&#8208;vinyloxiranes with the challenging nucleophilic dipoles (imino esters) was achieved. It was successfully applied to the stereodivergent synthesis of structurally rigid spirocyclic framework. A series of spiro compounds bearing a pyrroline and an olefin were synthesized in an enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent manner.







Abstract
The development of efficient and straightforward methods for obtaining all optically active isomers of structurally rigid spirocycles from readily available starting materials is of great value in drug discovery and chiral ligand development. However, the stereodivergent synthesis of spirocycles bearing multiple stereocenters remains an unsolved challenge owing to steric hindrance and ring strain. Herein, we report an enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent synthesis of rigid spirocycles through dual&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] annulation of oxy &#960;&#8208;allyl metallic dipoles with less commonly employed nucleophilic dipoles (imino esters). A series of spiro compounds bearing a pyrroline and an olefin were easily synthesized in an enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent manner (up to 19:1 dr, &gt;99&#8201;% ee), which showed great promise as a new type of N&#8208;olefin ligand. Preliminary mechanistic studies were also carried out to understand the process of this bimetallic catalysis.

         <title>MXene&#8208;Copper/Cobalt Hybrids via Lewis Acidic Molten Salts Etching for High Performance Symmetric Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ti3C2 MXene&#8208;Cu/Co hybrids were fabricated through molten salt etching for illustrating their interactions. The pseudocapacitive contribution of Cu and a splendid specific capacitance of Ti3C2&#8208;Cu were demonstrated. A symmetric supercapacitor based on Ti3C2&#8208;Cu electrode delivered a high energy density of 103.3&#8197;&#956;Wh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.8&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
MXenes have attracted great interests as supercapacitors due to their metallic conductivity, high density, and hydrophilic nature. Herein we report Ti3C2&#8208;Cu/Co hybrids via molten salt etching in which the existence of metal atoms and their interactions with MXene via surficial O atoms were elucidated by XAFS for the first time. The electrochemical investigation of Ti3C2&#8208;Cu electrode demonstrated the pseudocapacitive contribution of Cu and a splendid specific capacitance of 885.0&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 in 1.0&#8197;M H2SO4. Symmetric supercapacitor Ti3C2&#8208;Cu//Ti3C2&#8208;Cu was demonstrated with operating voltage of 1.6&#8197;V, areal capacitance of 290.5&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and stability over 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles. It delivered an areal energy density of 103.3&#8197;&#956;Wh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at power density of 0.8&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, based on which a supercapacitor pouch was fabricated. It provides deeper insights into the molten salt mechanism and strategies for designing MXene&#8208;based materials for electrochemical energy storage.

         <title>Influence of Isomerism on Radioluminescence of Purely Organic Phosphorescence Scintillators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present an isomerism strategy to study the effect of molecular structures on radioluminescence. Under UV&#8208;light excitation, all isomers showed bright phosphorescence with an efficiency of up to 22.8&#8201;%. Unexpectedly, both m&#8208;BA and p&#8208;BA scintillators showed bright luminescence under X&#8208;ray irradiation, which was ascribed to both excellent electrical conductivity and efficient suppression of non&#8208;radiative decay.







Abstract
There are few reports about purely organic phosphorescence scintillators, and the relationship between molecular structures and radioluminescence in organic scintillators is still unclear. Here, we presented isomerism strategy to study the effect of molecular structures on radioluminescence. The isomers can achieve phosphorescence efficiency of up to 22.8&#8201;% by ultraviolet irradiation. Under X&#8208;ray irradiation, both m&#8208;BA and p&#8208;BA show excellent radioluminescence, while o&#8208;BA has almost no radioluminescence. Through experimental and theoretical investigation, we found that radioluminescence was not only affected by non&#8208;radiation in emissive process, but also highly depended on the material conductivity caused by the different molecular packing. This study not only allows us to clearly understand the relationship between the molecular structures and radioluminescence, but also provides a guidance to rationally design new organic scintillators.

         <title>Chiral Recognition on Bare Gold Surfaces by Quartz Crystal Microbalance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) system, a bare gold surface which has chiral phases was shown to prefer the adsorption of D&#8208;type amino acid without relying on the organic selector layer on the surface.







Abstract
Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) is one of the powerful tools for the studies of molecular recognition and chiral discrimination. Its efficiency mainly relies on the design of the functional sensitive layer on the electrode surface. However, the organic sensitive layer may easily cause dissipation of oscillation or detachment and weaken the signal transfer during the molecular recognition processes. In this work, we reveal for the first time that the bare metal surface without the organic selector layer has the capability for chiral recognition in the QCM system. During the adsorption of various chiral amino acids, relatively higher selectivity of D&#8208;enantiomers on gold (Au) surface was shown by the QCM detection. Based on analyses of the surface crystalline structure and density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that the chiral nature of Au surface plays an important role in the selective binding of specific D&#8208;amino acids. These results may open new insights on chiral detection by QCM system. It will also promote the construction of novel chiral sensing systems with both efficient detection and separation capability.

         <title>Reduction of Nitrogen Oxides by Hydrogen with Rhodium(I)&#8211;Platinum(II) Olefin Complexes as Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalyzed hydrogenation of NO2, NO, and N2O is achieved under mild conditions by air stable olefin RhI&#8211;PtII bimetallic complexes. In the molecular catalysts, the Rh&#8722;Pt interaction is a direct metal&#8722;metal bond and cooperativity of both metals in substrate activation is proposed based on DFT. A hyponitrite rhodium complex is a key intermediate for the N&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming step in the catalytic reduction of NO.







Abstract
The nitrogen oxides NO2, NO, and N2O are among the most potent air pollutants of the 21st century. A bimetallic RhI&#8211;PtII complex containing an especially designed multidentate phosphine olefin ligand is capable of catalytically detoxifying these nitrogen oxides in the presence of hydrogen to form water and dinitrogen as benign products. The catalytic reactions were performed at room temperature and low pressures (3&#8211;4&#8197;bar for combined nitrogen oxides and hydrogen gases). A turnover number (TON) of 587 for the reduction of nitrous oxide (N2O) to water and N2 was recorded, making these RhI&#8211;PtII complexes the best homogeneous catalysts for this reaction to date. Lower TONs were achieved in the conversion of nitric oxide (NO, TON=38) or nitrogen dioxide (NO2, TON of 8). These unprecedented homogeneously catalyzed hydrogenation reactions of NOx were investigated by a combination of multinuclear NMR techniques and DFT calculations, which provide insight into a possible reaction mechanism. The hydrogenation of NO2 proceeds stepwise, to first give NO and H2O, followed by the generation of N2O and H2O, which is then further converted to N2 and H2O. The nitrogen&#8722;nitrogen bond&#8208;forming step takes place in the conversion from NO to N2O and involves reductive dimerization of NO at a rhodium center to give a hyponitrite (N2O22&#8722;) complex, which was detected as an intermediate.

&lt;p&gt;Catalyzed hydrogenation of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NO, and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is achieved under mild conditions by air stable olefin Rh&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; bimetallic complexes. In the molecular catalysts, the Rh&#8722;Pt interaction is a direct metal&#8722;metal bond and cooperativity of both metals in substrate activation is proposed based on DFT. A hyponitrite rhodium complex is a key intermediate for the N&#8722;N bond-forming step in the catalytic reduction of NO.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nitrogen oxides NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NO, and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O are among the most potent air pollutants of the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century. A bimetallic Rh&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complex containing an especially designed multidentate phosphine olefin ligand is capable of catalytically detoxifying these nitrogen oxides in the presence of hydrogen to form water and dinitrogen as benign products. The catalytic reactions were performed at room temperature and low pressures (3&#8211;4&#8197;bar for combined nitrogen oxides and hydrogen gases). A turnover number (TON) of 587 for the reduction of nitrous oxide (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) to water and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was recorded, making these Rh&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complexes the best homogeneous catalysts for this reaction to date. Lower TONs were achieved in the conversion of nitric oxide (NO, TON=38) or nitrogen dioxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, TON of 8). These unprecedented homogeneously catalyzed hydrogenation reactions of NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; were investigated by a combination of multinuclear NMR techniques and DFT calculations, which provide insight into a possible reaction mechanism. The hydrogenation of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; proceeds stepwise, to first give NO and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, followed by the generation of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, which is then further converted to N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. The nitrogen&#8722;nitrogen bond-forming step takes place in the conversion from NO to N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and involves reductive dimerization of NO at a rhodium center to give a hyponitrite (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) complex, which was detected as an intermediate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tetrahedral [Sb(AuMe)4]3&#8722; Occurring in Multimetallic Cluster Syntheses: About the Structure&#8208;Directing Role of Methyl Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[Sb(AuMe)4]3&#8722; formed in a reaction of (Sn2Sb2)2&#8722; with [AuMePPh3] that affords multimetallic clusters for other reactant ratios. A central Sb atom bridges four free&#8208;standing {AuMe} units, which is unprecedented for main group metal complexes. Comprehensive DFT investigations explained the stability of the tetrahedral structure relative to a pyramidal one found in related molecules and shed light on the reaction space of said multimetallic species.







Abstract
The anion of [K(crypt&#8208;222)]3[Sb(AuMe)4]&#8901;py (1; crypt&#8208;222=4,7,13,16,21,24&#8208;hexaoxa&#8208;1,10&#8208;diazabicyclo[8.8.8]hexacosane; py=pyridine) represents a rare example of a homoleptic heavy p&#8208;block metal atom being surrounded by four free&#8208;standing transition metal complex fragments, and the third example for a corresponding Sb compound. In contrast to all reported complexes of this type, the transition metal atoms possess twofold coordination only, hence the complex as a whole does not exhibit significant steric shielding or further linkage of the metal atoms. This is reflected in a high flexibility, as confirmed by slight deviations from a tetrahedral coordination of the Sb atom in the crystal and soft vibrational modes. An alternative pyramidal conformer, observed for a related arsenic compound with terminal phosphine ligands, is apparently disfavored owing to electron correlation effects. The compound is formed in a reaction that in another solvent or at other reactant concentrations yields salts of ternary cluster anions. By a combined experimental and theoretical study of different reaction conditions and previously unidentified side&#8208;products, we provide insight into multimetallic cluster synthesis reactions.

         <title>Direct Experimental Characterization of a Bridged Bicyclic Glycosyl Dioxacarbenium Ion by 1H and 13C&#8197;NMR Spectroscopy: Importance of Conformation on Participation by Distal Esters</title>

         <dc:description>
Simple methylation at the 4&#8208;position of a 4&#8208;O&#8208;benzoyl galactopyranosyl donor enables direct observation by low&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy of the previously elusive bridging dioxacarbenium ion, supporting the hypothesis that distal group participation by secondary esters is disfavored by the conformation of the ester.







Abstract
Low&#8208;temperature NMR studies with a 4&#8208;C&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;O&#8208;benzoyl galactopyranosyl donor enable the observation and characterization of a bridged bicyclic dioxacarbenium ion arising from participation by a distal ester. Variable&#8208;temperature NMR studies reveal this bridged ion to decompose at temperatures above &#8776;&#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C. In the absence of the methyl group, the formation of a bicyclic ion is not observed. It is concluded that participation by typical secondary distal esters in glycosylation reactions is disfavored in the ground state conformation of the ester from which it is stereoelectronically impossible. Methylation converts the secondary ester to a conformationally more labile tertiary ester, removes this barrier, and renders participation more favorable. Nevertheless, the minor changes in selectivity in model glycosylation reactions on going from the secondary to the tertiary esters at both low and room temperature argue against distal group participation being a major stereodirecting factor even for the tertiary system.

         <title>Ferrocene&#8208;Induced Perpetual Recovery on All Elemental Defects in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards stable solar cells, ferrocene as a perpetual recovering agent has been developed to fix all elemental defects in ABX3 perovskite by a chain&#8208;reaction cycle. The ferrocene cations can form a 1D perovskite structure which has suitable dissociation energy to covert back to light&#8208;harvesting 3D perovskite and reactivate its photovoltaic performance. Based on this recovering agent, perovskite solar cell can achieve &gt;10&#8201;000&#8197;h lifetime.







Abstract
Lead halide perovskites always emerge complex interactions among different elemental ions, which lead to multiple intrinsic imperfections. Elemental defects, such as amine, Pb, and I vacancies at A&#8208;, B&#8208;, and X&#8208;sites, are main issues to deteriorate perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Unfortunately, most previous passivators can only temporarily fix partial inactive vacancies as sacrificial agents. Herein, we propose a recovery agent, ferrocene (Fc), which can form a one&#8208;dimensional perovskite with adequate steric cavities and suitable dissociation energy to recover all elemental defects back to active light&#8208;harvesting perovskites, and regenerate Fc itself meanwhile. Based on this perpetual chain&#8208;reaction cycle, corresponding PSCs maintain &gt;10&#8201;000&#8208;hour lifetime in inert condition and &gt;1000&#8208;hour durabilities under various extreme environments, including continuous 85&#8201;&#176;C heating, 50&#8201;% relative humidity wetting, and 1&#8208;sun light soaking.

         <title>Dynamic Control of Sacrificial Bond Transformation in the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Molecular Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bond breaking/re&#8208;formation to tune local coordination: Deliberate construction and subsequent selective cleavage of sacrificial Fe&#8722;S bonds render flexible tunability to control the local coordination of metal single atoms. The oxidized sulfur functionalization around the Fe center helps the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C reach the ORR volcano&#8208;plot apex by optimizing the adsorption strength of the oxygenated intermediates.







Abstract
Atomically dispersed metal&#8208;nitrogen sites show great prospect for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), whereas the unsatisfactory adsorption&#8208;desorption behaviors of oxygenated intermediates on the metal centers impede improvement of the ORR performance. We propose a new conceptual strategy of introducing sacrificial bonds to remold the local coordination of Fe&#8722;Nx sites, via controlling the dynamic transformation of the Fe&#8722;S bonds in the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C single&#8208;atom catalyst. Spectroscopic and theoretical results reveal that the selective cleavage of the sacrificial Fe&#8722;S bonds induces the incorporation of the electron&#8208;withdrawing oxidized sulfur on the Fe centers. The newly functionalized moieties endow the catalyst with superior ORR activity and remarkable stability, owing to the reduced electron localization around the Fe centers facilitating the desorption of ORR intermediates. These findings provide a unique perspective for precisely controlling the coordination structure of single&#8208;atom materials to optimize their activity.

         <title>Iodide&#8208;Induced Fragmentation of Polymerized Hydrophilic Carbon Nitride for High&#8208;Performance Quasi&#8208;Homogeneous Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iodide ions are utilized as an inhibitor for terminating the polymerization of PCN (TP&#8208;PCN). The resulting ultrathin and small&#8208;sized TP&#8208;PCN have abundant edge active sites (AEASs). They greatly enhance the O2 adsorption/activation capacity and the 2&#8201;e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) selectivity. As expected, the TP&#8208;PCN affords a remarkably increased photocatalytic H2O2 production activity.







Abstract
Polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) as a class of two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR) photocatalyst has attracted much attention for H2O2 production. However, the low activity and inferior selectivity of 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR greatly restrict the H2O2 production efficiency. Herein, we develop a new strategy to synthesize hydrophilic, fragmented PCN photocatalyst by the terminating polymerization (TP&#8208;PCN) effect of iodide ions. The obtained TP&#8208;PCN with abundant edge active sites (AEASs), which can form quasi&#8208;homogeneous photocatalytic system, exhibits superior H2O2 generation rate (3265.4&#8197;&#956;M&#8201;h&#8722;1), far surpassing PCN and other PCN&#8208;based photocatalysts. DFT calculations further indicate that TP&#8208;PCN is more favorable for electron transiting from &#946; spin&#8208;orbital to the &#960;* orbitals of O2, which optimizes O2 activation and reduces the energy barrier of H2O2 formation. This work provides a new concept for designing functional photocatalysts and understanding the mechanism of O2 activation in ORR for H2O2 production.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed s&#8208;Block Magnesium Sites for Electroreduction of CO2 to CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed magnesium atoms embedded in graphitized C3N4 (Mg&#8208;C3N4) show weak CO adsorption because of nondirectionally delocalized Mg 3&#8197;s orbit. Mg&#8208;C3N4 exhibits a high turnover frequency (TOF) of &#8776;18&#8201;000&#8197;hour&#8722;1 under a CO Faradaic efficiency &#8805;90&#8201;%. Furthermore, the flow cell fabricated with Mg&#8208;C3N4 reaches a large current density of &#8722;300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 under a CO Faradaic efficiency &#8805;90&#8201;%.







Abstract
Atomically dispersed transition metal sites have been extensively studied for CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2RR) to CO due to their robust CO2 activation ability. However, the strong hybridization between directionally localized d orbits and CO vastly limits CO desorption and thus the activities of atomically dispersed transition metal sites. In contrast, s&#8208;block metal sites possess nondirectionally delocalized 3s orbits and hence weak CO adsorption ability, providing a promising way to solve the suffered CO desorption issue. Herein, we constructed atomically dispersed magnesium atoms embedded in graphitic carbon nitride (Mg&#8208;C3N4) through a facile heat treatment for CO2RR. Theoretical calculations show that the CO desorption on Mg sites is easier than that on Fe and Co sites. This theoretical prediction is demonstrated by experimental CO temperature program desorption and in situ attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy. As a result, Mg&#8208;C3N4 exhibits a high turnover frequency of &#8776;18&#8201;000 per hour in H&#8208;cell and a large current density of &#8722;300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in flow cell, under a high CO Faradaic efficiency &#8805;90&#8201;% in KHCO3 electrolyte. This work sheds a new light on s&#8208;block metal sites for efficient CO2RR to CO.

         <title>An Effective Strategy for Designing Nonlinear Optical Crystals by Combining the Structure&#8208;Directing Property of Oxyfluorides with Chemical Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;centrosymmetric and polar Ba2[MoO3F(IO3)](MoO3F2) was synthesized by combining the structure&#8208;directing property of oxyfluorides with chemical substitution. Measurement of the optical properties shows that the compound satisfies all key property requirements to be promising application from UV to mid&#8208;infrared regions as SHG materials.







Abstract
Rationally designing a high&#8208;performance nonlinear optical (NLO) crystal remains a great ongoing challenge. It involves not only the design of noncentrosymmetric structures but also property optimization. In this communication, a new strategy for effectively designing the NLO crystal has been put forward, that is, using the structure&#8208;directing property of oxyfluoride anions to obtain a noncentrosymmetric and polar structure, and then by substitution of IO3&#8722; for isovalent F&#8722; anions to further enhance the SHG response. With this strategy, a new iodate fluoride, Ba2[MoO3F(IO3)](MoO3F2) has been successfully designed from the Ba2(MoO3F2)F2 with the cis&#8208;directing [MoO4F2]4&#8722; groups. It exhibits a large SHG response (&#8776;8&#215;KDP), a wide transparent region (0.30&#8211;10.92&#8197;&#956;m), a high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (LDT) (88.53&#8197;MW&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and a large birefringence (&#8776;0.264@532&#8197;nm). These indicate Ba2[MoO3F(IO3)](MoO3F2) would be a promising NLO crystal.

         <dc:description>
Herein, a photocatalyzed, intramolecular C(sp2)&#8722;H amidation of N&#8208;benzoyloxyamides has been developed to afford &#948;&#8208;benzolactams with an aryl&#8208;alkyl &#963;&#8208;bond relocation. Upon the formation of amidyl radical via reductive N&#8722;O bond cleavage, selective radical ipso&#8208;addition followed by a redox&#8208;neutral radical&#8211;polar crossover was suggested to be responsible for the preferential C&#8722;C bond migration.







Abstract
We report an approach for the intramolecular C(sp2)&#8722;H amidation of N&#8208;acyloxyamides under photoredox conditions to produce &#948;&#8208;benzolactams with an aryl&#8208;alkyl &#963;&#8208;bond relocation. Computational studies on the designed reductive single electron transfer strategy led us to identify N&#8208;[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)benzoyl] group as the most effective amidyl radical precursor. Upon the formation of an azaspirocyclic radical intermediate by the selective ipso&#8208;addition with outcompeting an ortho&#8208;attack, radical&#8211;polar crossover was then rationalized to lead to the rearomative ring&#8208;expansion with preferential C&#8722;C bond migration.

Computational studies on the designed reductive single electron transfer strategy led us to identify &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzoyl] group as the most effective amidyl radical precursor. Upon the formation of an azaspirocyclic radical intermediate by the selective &lt;i&gt;ipso&lt;/i&gt;-addition with outcompeting an &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-attack, radical&#8211;polar crossover was then rationalized to lead to the rearomative ring-expansion with preferential C&#8722;C bond migration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Corroles: The Hitherto Elusive Parent Macrocycle and its Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three synthetic routes to the completely unsubstituted corrole are described. This allows for full characterization of five metal complexes chelated by this corrole, which were used to uncover unique beneficial features that are relevant to clean energy catalysis and many other purposes.







Abstract
Corroles, macrocycles that owe their name to the cobalt&#8208;chelating prosthetic group of vitamin B12 and share numerous features with the iron&#8208;chelating porphyrin present in heme proteins/enzymes, constantly cross new boundaries ever since stable derivatives became easily accessible. Particularly important is the increasing utilization of corroles and the corresponding metal complexes for the benefit of mankind, in terms of new drug candidates for treating various diseases and as catalysts for sustainable energy relevant processes. One challenge is to gain access to the plain macrocycle, as to allow for full elucidation of the most fundamental properties of corroles. We have obtained the substituent&#8208;free corrole by several surprising and conceptually different pathways. Selected features of the corresponding metal complexes are illuminated, for pointing towards unique phenomena that are anticipated to largely expand the horizon regarding their utilization for contemporary catalysis.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Reaction of Propargyl Esters and Alkynylsilanes: Synthesis of Vinylallene Derivatives through a Twofold 1,2&#8208;Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient synthesis of structurally complex allenylsilanes through gold&#8208;catalyzed coupling of propargyl esters with alkynylsilanes is described. DFT calculations support a stepwise pathway consisting of two 1,2&#8208;rearrangements (acyloxy and silyl). A preliminary study on the enantioselective version would demonstrate its feasibility (er up to 95:5).







Abstract
The reaction of propargyl esters with alkynylsilanes under gold catalysis provides vinylallene derivatives through consecutive [1,2]&#8208;acyloxy/[1,2]&#8208;silyl rearrangements. Good yields, full atom&#8208;economy, broad substrate scope, easy scale&#8208;up and low catalyst loadings are salient features of this novel transformation. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations suggest a reaction mechanism involving initial [1,2]&#8208;acyloxy rearrangement to generate a gold vinylcarbene intermediate which upon regioselective attack of the alkynylsilane affords a vinyl cation which undergoes a type II&#8208;dyotropic rearrangement involving the silyl group and the metal fragment. Preliminary results on the enantioselective version of this transformation are also disclosed.

         <dc:description>Hypervalent iodine compounds are powerful reagents for the development of novel transformations. As they exhibit low toxicity, high functional group tolerance and stability in biocompatible media, they have been used for the functionalization of biomolecules. Herein, we report recent advances up to June 2021 in peptide and protein modification using hypervalent iodine reagents. Their use as group transfer or oxidizing reagents is discussed in this review, including methods targeting polar, aromatic or aliphatic amino acids and peptide termini.</dc:description>

         <title>Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper hybrid lead bromide perovskite nanosheets of phase pure n = 2: stabilized colloids stored in the solid state</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper lead halide perovskite (RP&#8208;LHP) nanonanostructures can be regarded as self&#8208;assembled quantum wells or superlattices of 3D perovskites with an intrinsic quantum well thickness of a single or a few (  n  = 1&#8208;4) lead halide layers; the quantum wells are separated by organic layers. They can be scaled down to a single quantum well dimension. Here, the preparation of highly (photo)chemical and colloidal stable hybrid LHP nanosheets (NSs) of ca. 7.4 &#956;m lateral size and 2.5 nm quantum well height (thereby presenting a deep blue emission at ca. 440 nm), is reported for the first time. The NSs are close&#8208;lying and they even interconnect when deposited on a substrate. Their synthesis is based on the use of the  p  &#8208;toluenesulfonic acid/dodecylamine (  p  TS/DDA) ligand pair and their (photo)chemical stability and photoluminescence is enhanced by adding EuBr  2  nanodots (EuNDs). Strikingly, they can be preserved as a solid and stored for at least one year. The blue emissive colloid can be recovered from the solid as needed by simply dispersing the powder in toluene and then using it to prepare solid films, making them very promising candidates for manufacturing devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Flower&#8208;like colloidal particles through precipitation polymerization of redox responsive liquid crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the plethora of available anisotropic inorganic particles, it remains challenging to fabricate non&#8208;spherical polymer particles, especially with angular features. Here we report on the synthesis of monodisperse, flower&#8208;like, liquid crystalline (LC) polymer particles by precipitation polymerization of an LC monomer mixture consisting of benzoic acid&#8208;functionalized acrylates and disulfide&#8208;functionalized diacrylates. Introduction of a minor amount of disulfide&#8208;functionalized diacrylates (&#8804; 10 wt%) induced the formation of flower&#8208;like shapes. The shape of the particles can be tuned from flower&#8208; to disk&#8208;like to spherical by elevating the polymerization temperature. The solvent environment also has a pronounced effect on the particle size. Time&#8208;resolved TEM reveals that the final particle morphology was formed in the early stages of the polymerization and that subsequent polymerization resulted in continued particle growth without affecting the morphology. Finally, the degradation of the particles under reducing conditions was much faster for flower&#8208;like particles than for spherical particles, a result of their higher surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio. This work introduces a facile and scalable preparation of non&#8208;spherical anisotropic organic particles which may lead to potential applications ranging from smart coatings to redox responsive carrier systems..</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Nanopatterns of Molecular Spoked Wheels with Orthogonal Pillars: The Observation of a Fullerene Haze</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular spoked wheels with intraannular functionalizable pillars are synthesized in a modular approach. The functionalities at their ends are variable, and a propargyl alcohol, a [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyrate, and a perylene monoimide are investigated. All compounds form two&#8208;dimensional crystals on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite at the solid/liquid interface. As determined by submolecularly resolved scanning tunneling microscopy, the pillars adopt equilibrium distances of 6.0 nm. The fullerene has a residual mobility, limited by the length of the flexible connector unit. In contrast, the more rigidly attached perylene monoimide units remain oriented along the surface normal and maintain a smallest distance of 2 nm above the graphite substrate. The experimental results are supported and rationalized by molecular dynamics simulations. The robust packing concept also holds for cocrystals with molecular hexagons that expand the pillar&#8208;pillar distances by 15 % and block unspecific intercalation.</dc:description>

In contrast, the more rigidly attached perylene monoimide units remain oriented along the surface normal and maintain a smallest distance of 2 nm above the graphite substrate. The experimental results are supported and rationalized by molecular dynamics simulations. The robust packing concept also holds for cocrystals with molecular hexagons that expand the pillar-pillar distances by 15 % and block unspecific intercalation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalyzed Dearomatization by Intramolecular Hydroalkoxylation/Claisen Rearrangement: Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Synthesis of Spirolactams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Described herein is a novel Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydroalkoxylation/Claisen rearrangement, allowing practical and atom&#8208;economical synthesis of a range of valuable spiro lactams from readily available ynamides in generally good to excellent yields with excellent diastereoselectivities and broad substrate scope. Importantly, an unexpected dearomatization of nonactivated arenes and heteroaromatic compounds is involved in this tandem sequence. Moreover, the asymmetric version of this tandem cyclization is also achieved via efficient kinetic resolution by chiral phosphoric acid catalysis. In addition,  [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement  is proved to be kinetically preferred over the related [1,3]&#8208;rearrangement by theoretical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Principle for DUV NLO Materials: &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Confinement Enlarges Band Gap**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a general principle, &#960;&#8208;conjugated confinement, for the rational design of high&#8208;performance DUV NLO materials whose band gaps are further enhanced. This principle is valid for all the DUV NLO materials known to date (the Chinese lunar year of the ox). Guided by this approach, the carbonophosphates are discovered for the first time as new DUV NLO candidates. Sr3Y[PO4][CO3]3 exhibits the shortest SHG output laser among phosphates to date.







Abstract
Current nonlinear optical materials face a conventional limitation in the trade&#8208;off between the band gap and birefringence, especially in the deep UV spectral region. To circumvent this dilemma, we propose a general principle, &#960;&#8208;conjugated confinement, to partially decouple the interunit &#960;&#8208;conjugated interactions by the separation of non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated units. The goal is to further enlarge the band gap to a value larger than that of the singular &#960;&#8208;conjugated counterpart and to maintain a suitable density of &#960;&#8208;conjugated units to gain a large optical anisotropy. We reveal that &#960;&#8208;conjugated confinement is a shared structural feature for all DUV NLO materials known to date, and thus, it provides a novel and essential design criterion for future design synthesis. Guided by this principle, the carbonophosphates are predicted to be a new promising DUV candidate system. Sr3Y[PO4][CO3]3 (1) and Na3X[PO4][CO3] (X=Ba, Sr, Ca, Mg, 2&#8211;5) exhibit not only greatly enhanced birefringence that is 3&#8211;24 times larger than that of singular phosphates but also enhanced band gaps that are 0.2&#8211;1.7&#8197;eV wider than those of singular carbonates.

&lt;p&gt;We propose a general principle, &#960;-conjugated confinement, for the rational design of high-performance DUV NLO materials whose band gaps are further enhanced. This principle is valid for all the DUV NLO materials known to date (the Chinese lunar year of the ox). Guided by this approach, the carbonophosphates are discovered for the first time as new DUV NLO candidates.

&lt;p&gt;Current nonlinear optical materials face a conventional limitation in the trade-off between the band gap and birefringence, especially in the deep UV spectral region. To circumvent this dilemma, we propose a general principle, &#960;-conjugated confinement, to partially decouple the interunit &#960;-conjugated interactions by the separation of non-&#960;-conjugated units. The goal is to further enlarge the band gap to a value larger than that of the singular &#960;-conjugated counterpart and to maintain a suitable density of &#960;-conjugated units to gain a large optical anisotropy. We reveal that &#960;-conjugated confinement is a shared structural feature for all DUV NLO materials known to date, and thus, it provides a novel and essential design criterion for future design synthesis.
