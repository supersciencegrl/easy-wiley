      <title>Tetrazine carbon nanotubes for pretargeted in vivo &#8216;click&#8208;to&#8208;release&#8217; bioorthogonal tumour imaging</title>
      <dc:description>The bioorthogonal inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) cleavage reaction between tetrazine and trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) is a powerful way to control the release of bioactive agents and imaging probes. In this study, a pretargeted activation strategy using single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) that bear tetrazines (TZ@SWCNTs) and a TCO&#8208;caged molecule was used to deliver active effector molecules. To optimize a turn&#8208;on signal by using in vivo fluorescence imaging, we developed a new fluorogenic near&#8208;infrared probe that can be activated by bioorthogonal chemistry and image tumours in mice by caging hemicyanine with TCO (tHCA). With our pretargeting strategy, we have shown selective doxorubicin prodrug activation and instantaneous fluorescence imaging in living cells. By combining a tHCA probe and a pretargeted bioorthogonal approach, real&#8208;time, non&#8208;invasive tumour visualization with high target&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio was achieved in a xenograft mice tumour model. The combined advantages of enhanced stability, kinetics and biocompatibility, and the superior pharmacokinetics of tetrazine functionalised SWCNTs could allow application of targeted&#8208;bioorthogonal decaging approaches with minimal off&#8208;site activation of fluorophore/drug.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The first iridium catalyzed, enantioconvergent amination of allenylic carbonates is reported. This process utilizes various commercially available carbamates and sulfonamides to generate allenylic amines including commonly employed protected groups (Boc, Fmoc, Cbz, Ts, Ns) in 62&#8208;82% yield and 87&#8208;98% ee.

      <title>Heavy&#8208;Atom Tunneling Through Crossing Potential Energy Surfaces: Cyclization of a Triplet 2&#8208;Formylarylnitrene to a Singlet 2,1&#8208;Benzisoxazole</title>
      <dc:description>Not long ago, the occurrence of quantum mechanical tunneling (QMT) chemistry involving atoms heavier than hydrogen was considered unreasonable. Contributing to the shift of this paradigm, we present here the discovery of a new and distinct heavy&#8208;atom QMT reaction. Triplet  syn  &#8208;2&#8208;formyl&#8208;3&#8208;fluorophenylnitrene, generated in argon matrices by UV&#8208;irradiation of an azide precursor, was found to spontaneously cyclize to singlet 4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2,1&#8208;benzisoxazole. Monitoring the transformation by IR spectroscopy, temperature&#8208;independent rate constants (  k  ~1.4 &#215; 10  &#8722;3  s  &#8722;1  ; half&#8208;life of ~8 min) were measured from 10 to 20 K. Computations estimate rate constants in fair agreement with experimental values, providing evidence for a mechanism involving heavy&#8208;atom QMT through crossing triplet to singlet potential energy surfaces. Moreover, the heavy&#8208;atom QMT takes place with considerable displacement of the oxygen atom, which establishes a new limit for the heavier atom involved in a QMT reaction in cryogenic matrices.</dc:description>

      <title>Graphdiyne:A New Structure of Fluorescent Quantum Dots</title>
      <dc:description>Graphdiyne (GDY) as an emerging two&#8208;dimensional carbon allotrope exhibits excellent performance in energy chemistry, catalytic chemistry, optoelectronics, electronics, etc. due to the unique structure combines sp&#8208; and sp2 hybrid carbon network. However, the poor solubility of pristine GDY is the major obstacle to its applications in many fields. Herein, we propose a facile strategy to control the preparation of graphdiyne quantum dots (GDY&#8208;Py QDs), in which pyrene groups are covalently linked to GDY by Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction. The as&#8208;prepared GDY&#8208;Py QDs with average diameter of about 3 &#177; 0.1 nm show superior dispersibility in many organic solvents and water. The GDY&#8208;Py QDs display not only brightly fluorescent with a high relative quantum yield (QY) of 42.82%, but also well&#8208;behaved as contrast agents in cell&#8208;imaging. The GDY&#8208;Py QDs are bestowed with high stability and non&#8208;cytotoxicity and exhibit long fluorescent time, which could offer great potential in optical imaging and biomedical application.</dc:description>

      <title>Intermarriage of Halide Perovskites and Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Crystals</title>
      <dc:description>This review examines the intermarriage of perovskite and metal&#8208;organic framework crystals as bringing new paradigms for material design and functionality. The strategic combination of halide perovskites and metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) crystals has generated a new family of porous composite materials that will enable new applications including optoelectronic, catalysis, sensing, and data encryption. This review surveys the current progress of this exciting new area. The fundamental aspects, including perovskite nucleation and growth, heterojunction electron&#8208;hole transfer, electronic structure and luminescence within confined spaces, are highlighted, suggesting the approaches by which guest confinement within MOFs can be synthetically designed. We further address the underlying principles and discuss the new insights and tools for the manipulation of these composite materials, pointing the way to the development of synthetic microporous semiconducting composites, as well as new strategies for host&#8208;guest interfacial engineering.</dc:description>

The resulting ternary MSCs, exhibiting sharp optical absorption peaking at 399 nm, are labelled &#8220;CdTeSe MSC&#8208;399&#8221;, and their particular PCs are &#8220;CdTeSe PC&#8208;399&#8221;. It is shown that when the amount of the primary amine (OTA) was relatively small, single&#8208;ensemble MSC&#8208;399 evolved without binary CdTe or CdSe MSCs. When the OTA amount was relatively large, CdTe MSC&#8208;371 appeared initially and then disappeared, while single&#8208;ensemble MSC&#8208;399 developed more deliberately. The larger the OTA amount was, the more slowly these changes proceeded. The substitution reaction of CdTe PC + CdSe M/F &#8660; CdTeSe PC&#8208;399 + CdTe M/F is proposed to be rate&#8208;determining for the MSC&#8208;399 formation in a Tol and OTA mixture. The present study provides further understanding regarding the transformation pathway between MSCs.</dc:description>

      <title>Surface&#8208;Plasmonic&#8208;Field&#8208;Induced Photoredox Catalysis and Mediated Electron Transfer for Washing&#8208;Free DNA Detection</title>
      <dc:description>Distance&#8208;dependent electromagnetic radiation and electron transfer have been commonly employed in washing&#8208;free fluorescence and electrochemical bioassays, respectively. Here, we combine the two distance&#8208;dependent phenomena to obtain sensitive washing&#8208;free DNA detection. Distance&#8208;dependent surface plasmonic field induces rapid photoredox catalysis of surface&#8208;bound catalytic labels, and distance&#8208;dependent mediated electron transfer allows for rapid electron transfer from the surface&#8208;bound labels to the electrode. An optimal system consists of a chemically reversible acceptor (Ru(NH 3  ) 6  3+  ), a chemically reversible photoredox catalyst (eosin Y), and a chemically irreversible donor (triethanolamine). The side reactions by O 2  do not significantly decrease the efficiency of photoredox catalysis. The energy transfer quenching between the electrode and label can be lowered by increasing the distance between them.

      <title>Advances in the Interfacial Assembly of Mesoporous Silica on Magnetite Particles</title>
      <dc:description>
Multifaceted materials: Interface assembly enables the integration of magnetic particles and mesoporous materials to form advanced core&#8211;shell magnetic mesoporous materials for a variety of applications in catalysis, environmental remediation, and biomedicine. This Minireview summarizes progress made in the synthesis of core&#8211;shell magnetic mesoporous silica and the adjustment of key parameters, including pore size, morphology, and pore orientation.







Abstract
Interfacing magnetic particles with ordered mesoporous materials is an effective direction for the development of functional porous composite materials with rationally designed core&#8211;shell structures. Owing to the combined properties of magnetic nanoparticles and mesoporous silica (high surface area, large pore volume, porosity, and biocompatibility), core&#8211;shell magnetic mesoporous silica materials have generated tremendous interest in various disciplines, including chemistry, materials, bioengineering, and biomedicine. Interfacial assembly strategies enable the rational construction of magnetic mesoporous silica materials with well&#8208;defined core&#8211;shell structure, morphology, pore parameters, and surface wettability, which can decisively influence their physical and chemical properties and thus improve their application performance. This Minireview summarizes recent progress in the synthesis of core&#8211;shell magnetic mesoporous silica and the adjustment of key parameters, including pore size, morphology, and pore orientation.

More light in chemistry: This Minireview highlights the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art and emerging techniques in theoretical and computational photochemistry. This is a challenging and rapidly evolving field that relates time&#8208;dependent spectroscopy with electronic structure theory and molecular dynamics for electronic excited states.







Abstract
Photochemistry is a fascinating branch of chemistry that is concerned with molecules and light. However, the importance of simulating light&#8208;induced processes is reflected also in fields as diverse as biology, material science, and medicine. This Minireview highlights recent progress achieved in theoretical chemistry to calculate electronically excited states of molecules and simulate their photoinduced dynamics, with the aim of reaching experimental accuracy. We focus on emergent methods and give selected examples that illustrate the progress in recent years towards predicting complex electronic structures with strong correlation, calculations on large molecules, describing multichromophoric systems, and simulating non&#8208;adiabatic molecular dynamics over long time scales, for molecules in the gas phase or in complex biological environments.

      <title>CAIXplatins: highly potent Pt(IV) prodrugs selectively against hypoxic tumors via microenvironment and metabolism regulation</title>
      <dc:description>Hypoxia and acidic microenvironment play a vital role in tumor metastasis and angiogenesis, generally compromising the chemotherapeutic efficacy. This provides a tantalizing angle for the Pt(IV) prodrugs design to achieve effective and selective killing of solid tumors. Herein, two carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX)&#8208;targeted platinum(IV) prodrugs have been developed, named as  CAIXplatins  . Based on the strong affinity and inhibitory activity for CAIX, CAIXplatins can not only overcome hypoxia and acidic microenvironment, but also inhibit metabolic pathways of hypoxic cancer cells responsible for energy supply and biomacromolecules synthesis, resulting in significantly enhanced therapeutic effect on hypoxic MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 tumors both  in vitro  and  in vivo  compared with cisplatin/oxaliplatin, accompanied with excellent anti&#8208;metastasis and anti&#8208;angiogenesis activities. The cancer selectivity indexes of CAIXplatins are 70~90 times higher than that of cisplatin/oxaliplatin, and the systemic side&#8208;effects of platinum drugs are effectively alleviated, thus showing great potential in further clinical use of cancer therapy.</dc:description>

      <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free C(sp2)&#8211;C(sp2) Cross&#8208;Coupling of Diazo Quinones with Catechol Boronic Esters</title>
      <dc:description>A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free C(sp  2  )&#8208;C(sp  2  ) bond formation reaction via the cross&#8208;coupling of diazo quinones with catechol boronic esters was developed.

The reaction tolerates various functionalities and is applicable to the derivatization of pharmaceuticals and natural products. The synthetic utility of the method was demonstrated by the short synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted triphenylenes and three bioactive natural products, honokiol, moracin M and stemofuran A. Mechanistic studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the reaction involves attack of the boronic ester by a singlet quinone carbene followed by a 1,2&#8208;rearrangement via a stepwise mechanism.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The utilizations of omnipresent, thermodynamically stable amides and aliphatic C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds for various functionalizations are ongoing challenges in catalysis. In particular, the direct coupling between the two functional groups has not been realized.

N&#8208;acylsuccinimides served as efficient acyl reagents for the streamlined synthesis of synthetically useful ketones from simple C(sp3)&#8211;H substrates. Detailed mechanistic investigations using both computational and experimental mechanistic studies were performed to construct a detailed and complete catalytic cycle. The origin of the superior reactivity of the N&#8208;acylsuccinimides over other more reactive acyl sources such as acyl chlorides was found to be an uncommon reaction pathway which commences with C&#8211;H activation prior to oxidative addition of the acyl substrate.</dc:description>

      <title>Regeneration of burnt&#8208;bridges on a DNA catenane walker</title>
      <dc:description>DNA walkers are molecular machines that can move with high precision in the nanoscale due to their structural and functional programmability. Despite recent advances in the field that allow exploring different energy sources, stimuli and mechanism of action for these nanomachines, continuous operation and re&#8208;usability of DNA walkers remains challenging because in most cases the steps, once taken by the walker, cannot be taken again. Herein we report the path regeneration of a burnt&#8208;bridges DNA catenane walker using RNase A. This walker uses a T7RNA polymerase that produces long RNA transcripts to hybridize to the path and move forward while the RNA remains hybridized to the path and blocks it for an additional walking cycle. We show that RNase A triggered RNA degradation restores the path and returns the walker to the initial position. RNase inhibition restarts the function of the walker. To date there is no similar strategy allowing the regeneration and continuous operation of burnt bridges DNA walkers. Our approach opens new avenues to expand the functionalities and applications of this type of artificial molecular motors.</dc:description>

      <title>Thermally activated adsorption in metal&#8208;organic frameworks with a temperature&#8208;tunable diffusion barrier layer</title>
      <dc:description>Modification of the external surfaces of metal organic frameworks offers a new level of control over their adsorption behavior. We have previously shown that capping of MOFs with ethylenediamine (EDA) can effectively retain small gaseous molecules [Nat. Comm. 2016, 7, 13871] at room temperature.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Modification of the external surfaces of metal organic frameworks offers a new level of control over their adsorption behavior. We have previously shown that capping of MOFs with ethylenediamine (EDA) can effectively retain small gaseous molecules [Nat. Comm. 2016, 7, 13871] at room temperature. Here, we report a temperature&#8208;induced variation in the capping&#8208;layer gate opening mechanism through a combination of in situ IR experiments and ab initio simulations of the capping layer. We find an atypical acceleration and increase in the loading of weakly adsorbed molecules upon raising the temperature above room temperature.

      <title>Thermal&#8208;Gated Polymer Electrolytes for Smart Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>The smart self&#8208;protection is essential to avoid the safety issue of energy storage devices. However, conventional strategies based on sol&#8208;gel transition electrolytes often suffer from unstable self&#8208;recovery performance. Herein, smart separators based on thermal&#8208;gated poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) hydrogel electrolytes were developed for rechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). Such PNIPAM&#8208;based separators not only display a pore structure evolution from opened to closed state, but also exhibit a surface wettability transition from hydrophilic to hydrophobic behaviors when the temperature rises. This can suppress the migration of electrolyte ions across the separators, realizing the self&#8208;protection of ZIBs at high temperature. Furthermore, the thermal&#8208;gated behavior is highly reversible even after multiple heating/cooling cycles due to the reversibility of temperature&#8208;dependent structural evolution and hydrophilic/hydrophobic transition. This work will pave the way for designing thermal&#8208;responsive energy storage devices with safe and controlled energy delivery.</dc:description>

      <title>X&#8208;Ray Crystallography and Free Energy Calculations Reveal the Binding Mechanism of A2A Adenosine Receptor Antagonists.</title>
      <dc:description>We present a robust protocol based on iterations of free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations, chemical synthesis, biophysical mapping and X&#8208;ray crystallography to reveal the binding mode of an antagonist series to the adenosine A  2A  receptor (AR). Eight A  2A  AR binding site mutations from biophysical mapping experiments were initially analysed with sidechain FEP simulations, performed on alternate binding modes. The results distinctively supported one binding mode, which was subsequently used to design new chromone derivatives. Their affinities for the A  2A  AR were experimentally determined and investigated through a cycle of ligand&#8208;FEP calculations, validating the binding orientation of the different chemical substituents proposed. Subsequent X&#8208;ray crystallography of the A2AAR with a low and a high affinity chromone derivative confirmed the predicted binding orientation. The new molecules and structures here reported were driven by free energy calculations, and provide new insights on antagonist binding to the A  2A  AR, an emerging target in immuno&#8208;oncology.</dc:description>

      <title>Crystallization&#8208;Driven Asymmetric Helical Assembly of Conjugated Block Copolymer and the Aggregation Induced White&#8208;light Emission and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
      <dc:description>Control the self&#8208;assembly morphology of &#960;&#8208;conjugated block copolymer is of great interesting. In this work, amphiphilic poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene)&#8208; block  &#8208;poly(phenyl isocyanide)s (P3HT&#8208; b  &#8208;PPI) copolymers composed of &#960;&#8208;conjugated P3HT and optically active helical PPI segments were readily prepared. Taking advantage of the crystallizable feature of P3HT and the chirality of helical PPI segment, crystallization driven asymmetric self&#8208;assembly (CDASA) of the block copolymers lead to the formation of single&#8208;handed helical nanofibers with controlled length, narrow dispersity, and well&#8208;defined helicity. During the self&#8208;assembly process, the chirality of helical PPI was transferred to the supramolecular assemblies, making the helical assemblies with large optical activity. The single&#8208;handed helical assemblies of the block copolymers exhibited interesting white&#8208;light emission and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). The handedness and dissymmetric factor of the induced CPL can be finely tuned through the variation on the helicity and length of the helical nanofibers.</dc:description>

      <title>An Atomic View of Cation Diffusion Pathways from Single&#8208;Crystal Topochemical Transformations</title>
      <dc:description>The diffusion pathways of Li&#8208;ions as they traverse cathode structures in the course of insertion reactions underpin many questions fundamental to the functionality of Li&#8208;ion batteries. Much current knowledge derives from computational models or the imaging of lithiation behavior at larger length scales; however, it remains difficult to experimentally image Li&#8208;ion diffusion at the atomistic level. Here, by using topochemical Li&#8208;ion insertion and extraction to induce single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformations in a tunnel&#8208;structured V2O5 polymorph, coupled with operando powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, we leverage single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction to identify the sequence of lattice interstitial sites preferred by Li&#8208;ions to high depths of discharge, and use electron density maps to create a snapshot of ion diffusion in a metastable phase. Our methods enable the atomistic imaging of Li&#8208;ions in this cathode material in kinetic states and provide an experimentally validated angstrom&#8208;level 3D picture of atomic pathways thus far only conjectured through DFT calculations.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Electrochemical synthesis based on electron as reagents provide a broad prospect for commodity chemical manufacturing. A direct one&#8208;step route from amino C&#8208;N bonds electrooxidation to nitrile C&#8801;N bonds offer an alternative pathway for nitriles producting.

Here we proposed a model of vacancies&#8208;rich Ni(OH)2 atomic layer to understand performance relationship with structure. By theory calculations, the vacancy&#8208;induced local electropositive site chemisorbs the N atom with lone pairs of electrons and then attack the corresponding N(sp3)&#8208;H, thus accelerating amino C&#8208;N bond activates dehydrogenation directly into nitrile C&#8801;N bond. Vacancies&#8208;rich nanosheets exhibit up to 96.5% propionitrile selectivity at a moderately potential of 1.38 V.

      <title>The Direct Partial Oxidation of Methane to Dimethyl Ether over Pt/Y2O3 Catalysts Using an NO/O&#173;2 Shuttle</title>
      <dc:description>Using a mixture of NO+O  2  as the oxidant enabled the direct selective oxidation of methane to dimethyl ether (DME) over Pt/Y  2  O  3  . The reaction was carried out in a fixed bed reactor at 0.1 MPa over a temperature range of 275&#8208;375  o  C. During the activity tests, the only carbon&#8208;containing products were DME and CO  2  . The DME productivity (&#181;mol g  cat  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  ) was comparable to oxygenate productivities reported in the literature for strong oxidants (N  2  O, H  2  O  2  , O  3  ). The NO+O  2  mixture formed NO  2  which acted as the oxygen atom carrier for the ultimate oxidant O  2  . During the methane partial oxidation reaction, NO and NO  2  were not reduced to N&#173;&#173;  2  . In situ FTIR showed the formation of surface nitrate species, that are considered to be key intermediate species for the selective oxidation.</dc:description>

      <title>Mechanically Assisted Bioluminescence with Natural Luciferase</title>
      <dc:description>Mechanochemical analogues have been recently established for several enzymatic reactions, however they require periodic interruption of the reaction for sampling, dissolution, and (bio)chemical analysis to monitor their progress. By applying a mechanochemical protocol to induce bioluminescence analogous to that used by the marine ostracod  Cypridina  (  Vargula  )  hilgendorfii  here we demonstrate that the light emitted by a bioluminescent reaction can be used for direct monitoring of the progress of a mechanoenzymatic reaction without sampling. Mechanical treatment of  Cypridina  luciferase and luciferin generates bright blue light which can be readily spectroscopically detected and analyzed. We establish that this mechanically assisted bioluminescence proceeds through a mechanism identical to that of bioluminescence in solution however it has higher activation energy due to being diffusion&#8208;controlled in the viscous matrix. The results open prospects for application of luciferases as light&#8208;emissive reporters for mechanoenzymatic reactions, either as chemically coupled enzymatic labels to the reactant or as an internal standard added in the reaction mixture.</dc:description>

      <title>TMEDA in Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Hydromagnesiation: Formation&#160;of Iron(II)&#8208;Alkyl Species for Controlled Reduction to&#160;Alkene&#8208;Stabilized Iron(0)</title>
      <dc:description>N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;Tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) has been one of the most prevalent and successful additives used in iron&#8208;catalysis, finding application in reactions as diverse as cross&#8208;coupling, C&#8208;H activation and borylation. However, the role that TMEDA plays in these reactions remains largely undefined. Herein, studying the iron&#8208;catalyzed hydromagnesiation of styrene derivatives using TMEDA has provided molecular&#8208;level insight into the role of TMEDA in achieving effective catalysis. Key is the initial formation of TMEDA&#8208;iron(II) alkyl species which undergo a controlled reduction to selectively form catalytically active styrene&#8208;stabilized iron(0)&#8208;alkyl complexes. While TMEDA is not bound to the catalytically active species, these active iron(0) complexes cannot be accessed in the absence of TMEDA. This mode of action, allowing for controlled reduction and access to iron(0) species, represents a new paradigm for the role of this important reaction additive in iron catalysis.</dc:description>

Both properties are difficult to achieve together especially when the components are crystalline due to the intrinsic high brittleness of organic molecular crystals. We report an organic radical crystal system that has both high flexibility and high conductivity. The crystal consists of 9,10&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene radical cation (  BPEA  &#183;+  ) units, and shows flexibility under pressure with high conductivity in ambient condition exhibiting average conductivity of 2.68 S cm  &#8208;1  when normal linear shape, as well as 2.43 S cm  &#8208;1  when bent. The structural analysis reveals that both a short &#960;&#8208;&#960; distance (3.290 &#197;) between  BPEA  &#183;+  units that are aligned along the crystal length direction, and the presence of PF  6  &#8208;  counter ions induce flexiblity and high electircal conductivity.</dc:description>

      <title>Activity&#8208;based Genetically Encoded Fluorescent and Luminescent Probes for Detecting Formaldehyde in Living Cells</title>
      <dc:description>Formaldehyde (FA) is endogenously produced in living systems through a variety of biological processes, and has been implicated in many pathological conditions. Detection tools for biological FA are, therefore, of great interest. Here we report novel activity&#8208;based genetically encoded fluorescent and luminescent probes for detecting FA in aqueous solutions and living mammalian cells. A FA&#8208;reactive lysine analogue, PrAK, was site&#8208;specifically incorporated into the essential lysine sites of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and firefly luciferase (fLuc) to afford the fluorescent and luminescent probes, respectively. FA selectively reacts with the PrAK residues on EGFP and fLuc through 2&#8208;aza&#8208;Cope rearrangement, resulting in fluorescence and luminescence turn&#8208;on responses, respectively, to FA over potentially interfering reactive species in aqueous buffer. Moreover, the genetically encoded probes are capable of visualizing FA at physiologically relevant levels in living mammalian cells by fluorescence and luminescence imaging, demonstrating their potential as new tools to explore FA biology.</dc:description>

      <title>Cooperativity of Catechols and Amines in High Performance Dry/Wet Adhesives</title>
      <dc:description>The outstanding adhesive performance of mussel byssal threads has been a beacon of inspiration for materials scientists over the past few decades. Historically, presence of a significant amount of the unique catecholic amino acid dihydroxyphenylalanine (Dopa) has been considered to play a key role in strong dry and wet adhesive properties of the byssal interfacial proteins. In recent years, molecular and microscopic level studies using short peptides or small molecule analogs have investigated the roles of other amino acids in mussel adhesion. In particular, these studies have highlighted the cohesive role of cation&#8208;&#960; interactions as well as the adhesive synergy between Dopa and flanking lysine residues. Inspired to design advanced synthetic adhesives that exploit amino&#8208;catechol synergy, we synthesized polymeric pressure sensitive adhesives (PSAs) by copolymerizing traditional PSA monomers, butyl acrylate and acrylic acid, with mussel&#8208;inspired lysine&#8208; and aromatic&#8208;rich monomers. Of particular interest was to compare the consequences of decoupling amino and catechol moieties from each other (i.e. incorporated as separate monomers) versus a monomer architecture in which the catechol and amine were coupled together in a fixed orientation in the monomer side chain. Comprehensive multi&#8208;scale adhesion assays were used to probe performance at the molecular, microscopic and macroscopic levels through a combination of AFM&#8208;assisted force spectroscopy, peel and static shear adhesion. We showed that coupling of catechols and amines together within the same monomer side chain produced optimal cooperative effects in improving macroscopic adhesion performance. The findings in this study improve our understanding of underlying principles of mussel adhesion and provide a solid framework for rational design of high&#8208;performance bioinspired adhesives.</dc:description>

      <title>Inducing social self&#8208;sorting in organic cages to tune the shape of the internal cavity</title>

      <title>Sensitive morphological characterization of oriented high&#8208;density lipoprotein nanoparticles using&#160;31P NMR spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>The biological function of high&#8208;density lipoprotein (HDL) nanoparticles, the so&#8208;called good cholesterol that is associated with a low risk of heart disease, depends on their composition, morphology and size. The morphology of HDL particles composed of apolipoproteins, lipids and cholesterol is routinely visualised by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), but higher&#8208;resolution tools are needed to observe more subtle structural differences between particles of different composition. Here, reconstituted HDL formulations are oriented on glass substrates and solid&#8208;state  31  P NMR spectroscopy is shown to be highly sensitive to the surface curvature of the lipid headgroups. The spectra report potentially functionally important differences in the morphology of different HDL preparations that are not detected by TEM. This method provides new morphological insights into HDL comprising a naturally&#8208;occurring apolipoprotein A&#8208;I mutant, which may be linked to its atheroprotective properties, and holds promise as a future research tool in the clinical analysis of plasma HDL.</dc:description>

      <title>Quantifying Through&#8208;Space Substituent Effects</title>
      <dc:description>The description of substituents as electron donating or withdrawing leads to a perceived dominance of through&#8208;bond influences. The situation is compounded by the challenge of separating through&#8208;bond and through&#8208;space contributions. Here, we probe the experimental significance of through&#8208;space substituent effects in molecular interactions and reaction kinetics. Conformational equilibrium constants were transposed onto the Hammett substituent constant scale revealing dominant through&#8208;space substituent effects that cannot be described in classic terms. For example, NO  2  groups positioned over a biaryl bond exhibited similar influences as resonant electron donors. Meanwhile, the electro&#8208;enhancing influence of OMe/OH groups could be switched off or inverted by conformational twisting. 267 conformational equilibrium constants measured across eleven solvents were found to be better predictors of reaction kinetics than calculated electrostatic potentials, suggesting utility in other contexts and for benchmarking theoretical solvation models.</dc:description>

      <title>The Stabilization Effect of CO2 Chemistries in Li&#8208;O2/CO2 Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>The lithium (Li)&#8208;air battery possesses ultrahigh theoretical specific energy, however, even in pure oxygen (O  2  ), the vulnerability of conventional organic electrolytes and carbon cathodes towards reaction intermediates, especially O  2  &#8208;  , and corrosive oxidation and crack/pulverization of Li metal anode lead to poor cycling stability of the Li&#8208;air battery. Even worse, the water and/or CO  2  in air are reported to bring more serious parasitic reactions and security issues. Therefore, most significant improvements are achieved in pure O  2  , and thus the making &#8220;onboard&#8221; pure oxygen supply system is inevitable for practical Li&#8208;air battery, which not only reduces the energy density of the overall system, but also makes the system complex and expensive to produce and maintain. Therefore, realizing the ultimate goal of applying such systems in open&#8208;air environment is a demanding requirement. Here, contrary to previous assertions, we found that CO  2  could improve the stability of both anode and electrolyte, and a high&#8208;performance rechargeable Li&#8208;O  2  /CO  2  battery is then developed. The introduced CO  2  can not only facilitate the  in situ  formation of a passivated protective Li  2  CO  3  film on Li anode, but also restrain side reactions involving electrolyte and cathode by capturing O  2  &#8208;  . Moreover, the Pd/CNT catalyst in cathode can extend the battery lifespan by effectively tuning the product morphology and catalyzing the decomposition of Li&#173;  2  CO  3  . By simultaneously addressing the bottleneck problems of poor rechargeability, instability of carbon cathode, liquid electrolyte and Li anode, the designed Li&#8208;O  2  /CO  2  battery achieves a full discharge capacity of 6,628 mAh g  &#8208;1  and a long life of 715 cycles, which is even better than those of pure Li&#8208;O  2  batteries. We believe the findings here present an important step towards Li&#8208;air batteries from Li&#8208;O  2  batteries as well as other metal&#8208;air systems.</dc:description>

      <title>N&#8208;Annulated Perylene Bisimides to Bias the Differentiation of Metastable Supramolecular Assemblies into J&#8208; and H&#8208;Aggregates</title>
      <dc:description>We report the unique self&#8208;assembling features of&#160;  N  &#8208;annulated perylene bisimides (PBIs)&#160;  1  &#160;and&#160;  2  . The stability of the aggregates of diester&#160;  1  , in which no H&#8208;bonding interactions are operative, corroborates the significance of long&#8208;range van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals and dipole&#8208;dipole electrostatic interactions in the construction of stable supramolecular assemblies. The incorporation of amide functional groups to the&#160;  N  &#8208;annulated PBI in&#160;  2  &#160;results in a stimulating pathway differentiation to achieve up to three J&#8208;type aggregates and a fourth H&#8208;type aggregate depending on the experimental conditions. The results presented demonstrate unprecedented levels of control over synthetic supramolecular self&#8208;assembly and the rich differentiation that&#160;  N  &#8208;annulated PBIs exhibit, opening the door to new, complex, functional supramolecular materials.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We report the unique self&#8208;assembling features of&#160;  N  &#8208;annulated perylene bisimides (PBIs)&#160;  1  &#160;and&#160;  2  . The stability of the aggregates of diester&#160;  1  , in which no H&#8208;bonding interactions are operative, corroborates the significance of long&#8208;range van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals and dipole&#8208;dipole electrostatic interactions in the construction of stable supramolecular assemblies. The incorporation of amide functional groups to the&#160;  N  &#8208;annulated PBI in&#160;  2  &#160;results in a stimulating pathway differentiation to achieve up to three J&#8208;type aggregates and a fourth H&#8208;type aggregate depending on the experimental conditions. The results presented demonstrate unprecedented levels of control over synthetic supramolecular self&#8208;assembly and the rich differentiation that&#160;  N  &#8208;annulated PBIs exhibit, opening the door to new, complex, functional supramolecular materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Rational&#160;Design of the Metal&#8208;Free KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF) Family Member C(NH2)3SO3F with Superior Ultraviolet Optical Nonlinearity</title>
      <dc:description>The first fluorosulfonic ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) material, C(NH  2  )  3  SO  3  F, is rationally designed by taking the KBe  2  BO  3  F  2  (KBBF) as the parent compound. C(NH  2  )  3  SO  3  F features the similar topological layer with KBBF by replacing (BO  3  )  3&#8208;  with C(NH  2  )  3  +  triangles and the substitution of BeO  3  F with SO  3  F  &#8208;  tetrahedral. Therefore, C(NH  2  )  3  SO  3  F is a metal&#8208;free UV NLO crystal. Benefiting from the coplanar configuration of the C(NH  2  )  3  +  cationic groups, it possesses large SHG response of 5&#215;KDP and moderate birefringence of 0.133@1064 nm. Besides, it has a short UV cutoff edge of 200 nm. The calculated results reveal the shortest SHG phase &#8208; matching wavelength can reach 200 nm. These &#64257;ndings point out exploring metal&#8208;free compounds as nontoxic and lowcost UV NLO materials will be a new research area.</dc:description>

      <title>Acceptor&#8208;doping accelerated charge separation in Cu2O photocathode for photoelectrochemical water splitting: a theoretical and experimental study</title>
      <dc:description>Cu  2  O is a typical photoelectrocatalyst for sustainable hydrogen production, while the fast charge recombination hinders its further development. Herein, Ni  2+  cations have been doped into Cu  2  O lattice (named as Ni&#8208;Cu  2  O) via a simple hydrothermal method and act as electron traps. Theoretical results predict that the Ni dopants produce an acceptor impurity level and lower the energy barrier of hydrogen evolution. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements demonstrate that Ni&#8208;Cu  2  O exhibits a photocurrent density of 0.83 mA cm  &#8722;2  , which is 1.34 times higher than that of Cu  2  O. And the photostability has been enhanced by 7.81 times. Moreover, characterizations confirm the enhanced light&#8208;harvesting, facilitated charge separation and transfer, prolonged charge lifetime, and increased carrier concentration of Ni&#8208;Cu  2  O.

      <title>A Self&#8208;Assembled Rhombohedral DNA Crystal Scaffold with Tunable Cavity Sizes and High Resolution Structural Detail</title>
      <dc:description>Rationally designing DNA crystal lattices to scaffold molecular species and solve their structure with X&#8208;ray crystallography is the foundational goal of structural DNA nanotechnology. DNA is an ideal molecule for the construction of 3D crystals with tunable properties due to its high programmability based on canonical Watson&#8208;Crick base pairing, with crystal assembly in all three dimensions facilitated by immobile Holliday junctions and sticky end cohesion. Despite the promise of these systems, only a handful of unique crystal scaffolds have been reported. In this work, we describe a new crystal system with a repeating sequence that mediates the assembly of a 3D scaffold via a series of Holliday junctions linked together with complementary sticky ends. By using an optimized junction sequence, we were able to determine a high resolution (2.7 &#197;) structure containing R3 crystal symmetry, with a slight subsequent improvement (2.6 &#197;) using a modified sticky&#8208;end sequence. The structure is distinct due to a unique immobile Holliday junction sequence, which in turn allowed us to produce crystals that provided a structure with unprecedented atomic detail. Furthermore, we expanded the crystal cavities by 50% by adding an additional helical turn between junctions, and we solved the structure of the resulting lattices to 4.5 &#197; resolution by molecular replacement. These crystals will potentially enable the discrete placement of guest molecules&#8212;such as small molecule catalysts, nanoparticles, or peptides/proteins&#8212;amenable to the cavity size within the scaffold with atomic precision.</dc:description>

      <title>Necroptosis Induced by Ruthenium(II) Complexes as Dual Catalytic Inhibitors of Topoisomerase I/II</title>
      <dc:description>Inducing necroptosis in cancer cells is an effective approach to circumvent drug&#8208;resistance. Metal&#8208;based triggers have, however, rarely been reported. Ruthenium(II) complexes containing 1,1&#8208;(pyrazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyreno[4,5&#8208;e][1,2,4]triazine were developed with a series of different ancillary ligands (  Ru1  &#8208;  7  ). The combination of the main ligand with bipyridyl and phenylpyridyl ligands endows  Ru7  with superior nucleus&#8208;targeting properties. As a rare dual catalytic inhibitor,  Ru7  effectively inhibits the endogenous activities of topoisomerase (topo) I and II and kills cancer cells by necroptosis. The cell signaling pathway from topo inhibition to necroptosis was elucidated. Furthermore,  Ru7  displays significant antitumor activity against drug&#8208;resistant cancer cells  in vivo  . To the best of our knowledge,  Ru7  is the first Ru&#8208;based necroptosis&#8208;inducing chemotherapeutic agent.</dc:description>

Ruthenium(II) complexes containing 1,1&#8208;(pyrazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyreno[4,5&#8208;e][1,2,4]triazine were developed with a series of different ancillary ligands (  Ru1  &#8208;  7  ). The combination of the main ligand with bipyridyl and phenylpyridyl ligands endows  Ru7  with superior nucleus&#8208;targeting properties. As a rare dual catalytic inhibitor,  Ru7  effectively inhibits the endogenous activities of topoisomerase (topo) I and II and kills cancer cells by necroptosis. The cell signaling pathway from topo inhibition to necroptosis was elucidated. Furthermore,  Ru7  displays significant antitumor activity against drug&#8208;resistant cancer cells  in vivo  . To the best of our knowledge,  Ru7  is the first Ru&#8208;based necroptosis&#8208;inducing chemotherapeutic agent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Highly Efficient Electroreduction of CO2 to C2+ Alcohols on Heterogeneous Dual Active Sites</title>
      <dc:description>Electroreduction of CO2  to liquid fuels such as ethanol and n&#8208;propanol, powered by renewable electricity, offers a promising strategy for controlling the global carbon balance and addressing the need for the storage of intermittent renewable energy. In this work, we discovered that the composite composed of nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene quantum dots (NGQ) on CuO&#8208;derived Cu nanorods (NGQ/Cu&#8208;nr) was outstanding electrocatalyst for CO2  reduction to ethanol and n&#8208;propanol. The Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ alcohols could reach 52.4% with a total current density of 282.1 mA&#8226;cm&#8208;2  . This is the highest FE for C2+ alcohol with commercial current density to date. Control experiments and density functional theory (DFT) studies demonstrated that the NGQ/Cu&#8208;nr could provide dual catalytic active sites, and could stabilize the CH2CHO intermediate to enhance the FE of alcohols significantly through further carbon protonation. The NGQ and Cu&#8208;nr had excellent synergistic effect for accelerating the CO2  reduction reaction to alcohols.</dc:description>

      <title>Autonomous Discovery in the Chemical Sciences Part&#8197;II: Outlook</title>
      <dc:description>
Exploring the possibilities: This two&#8208;part Review evaluates the contribution of computer assistance and automation to various aspects of discovery in the chemical sciences. This second part reflects on exemplary case studies introduced in the first part. A set of open research directions in terms of both practical and methodological challenges are defined; addressing these would advance the extent to which these systems can make meaningful discoveries.







Abstract
This two&#8208;part Review examines how automation has contributed to different aspects of discovery in the chemical sciences. In this second part, we reflect on a selection of exemplary studies. It is increasingly important to articulate what the role of automation and computation has been in the scientific process and how that has or has not accelerated discovery. One can argue that even the best automated systems have yet to &#8220;discover&#8221; despite being incredibly useful as laboratory assistants. We must carefully consider how they have been and can be applied to future problems of chemical discovery in order to effectively design and interact with future autonomous platforms. The majority of this Review defines a large set of open research directions, including improving our ability to work with complex data, build empirical models, automate both physical and computational experiments for validation, select experiments, and evaluate whether we are making progress towards the ultimate goal of autonomous discovery. Addressing these practical and methodological challenges will greatly advance the extent to which autonomous systems can make meaningful discoveries.
