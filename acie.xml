      <title>Frustrated Lewis Pair Chelation as a Vehicle for Low Temperature Semiconductor Element and Polymer Deposition</title>
      <dc:description>The stabilization of silicon(II) and germanium(II) dihydrides by an intramolecular Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP) ligand, PB,  i Pr&#173;2P(C6H4)BCy2 (Cy = cyclohexyl) is reported. The resulting hydride complexes [PB{SiH2}] and [PB{GeH2}] are indefinitely stable at room temperature, yet can deposit films of silicon and germanium, respectively, upon mild thermolysis in solution. Hallmarks of this work include: (1) the ability to recycle the FLP phosphine&#8208;borane ligand (PB) after element deposition, and (2) the single&#8208;source precursor [PB{SiH2}] deposits Si films at a record low temperature from solution (110 &#176;C). The dialkylsilicon(II) adduct [PB{SiMe2}] was also prepared, and shown to release poly(dimethylsilane) [SiMe2]n upon heating. Overall, this study introduces a &#8220;closed loop&#8221; deposition strategy for semiconductors that steers materials science away from the use of harsh reagents or high temperatures.</dc:description>

      <title>Simultaneous Enantiospecific Detection of Multiple Compounds in Mixtures using NMR Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>Chirality plays a fundamental role in nature, but its detection and quantification still face many limitations. To date, the enantiospecific analysis of mixtures necessarily requires prior separation of the individual components. The simultaneous enantiospecific detection of multiple chiral molecules in a mixture represents a major challenge, which would lead to a significantly better understanding of the underlying biological processes; e.g. via enantiospecifically analysing metabolites in their native environment. Here, we report on the first in situ enantiospecific detection of a thirty&#8208;nine&#8208;component mixture. As a proof of concept, eighteen essential amino acids at physiological concentrations were simultaneously enantiospecifically detected using NMR spectroscopy and a chiral solvating agent. This work represents a first step towards the simultaneous multicomponent enantiospecific analysis of complex mixtures, a capability that will have substantial impact on metabolism studies, metabolic phenotyping, chemical reaction monitoring, and many other fields where complex mixtures containing chiral molecules require efficient characterisation.</dc:description>

      <title>Revealing isolated M&#8208;N3C1 active sites for efficient collaborative oxygen reduction catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Single atom catalysts (SACs) are of great importance for oxygen reduction, a critical process in renewable energy technologies such as fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries. The catalytic performance of SACs largely depends on the structure of their active sites, but explorations of highly active structures for SAC active sites are still limited. Herein, we demonstrate a combined experimental and theoretical study of oxygen reduction catalysis on SACs, which incorporate M&#8208;N 3  C 1  site structure, composed of atomically dispersed transition metals (e.g., Fe, Co, and Cu) in nitrogen doped carbon nanosheets. The resulting SACs with M&#8208;N 3  C 1  sites exhibited prominent oxygen reduction catalytic activities in both acidic and alkaline media, following the trend Fe&#8208;N 3  C 1  &gt; Co&#8208;N 3  C 1  &gt; Cu&#8208;N 3  C 1  . Theoretical calculations suggest the C atoms in these structures behave as collaborative adsorption sites to M atoms, thanks to interactions between the d  / p  orbitals of the M/C atoms in the M&#8208;N 3  C 1  sites, enabling dual site oxygen reduction. Compared with the common single site mechanism, the proposed dual site mechanism was determined to be more favorable for oxygen reduction catalysis, in good agreement with the experimental findings.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of Vinylene&#8208;Linked Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Polymers via the Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Interest in linear conjugated polymers has significantly increased in recent decades due to their semiconducting properties and promising applications in organic optoelectronics. To date, the extension of linear conjugated polymers into two&#8208;dimensional conjugated polymers (2D CPs), which can also be regarded as 2D &#960;&#8208;conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs), remains largely unexplored due to limited synthetic methodologies. In this work, we demonstrate the first synthesis of vinylene&#8208;linked 2D CPs, namely, 2D poly(phenylenequinoxalinevinylene)s  2D&#8208;PPQV1  and  2D&#8208;PPQV2  ,  via  the Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons (HWE) reaction of  C  2  &#8208;symmetric 1,4&#8208;bis(diethylphosphonomethyl)benzene or 4,4'&#8208;bis(diethylphosphonomethyl)biphenyl with  C  3  &#8208;symmetric 2,3,8,9,14,15&#8208;hexa(4&#8208;formylphenyl)diquinoxalino[2,3&#8208;  a  :2',3'&#8208;  c  ]phenazine as monomers.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Interest in linear conjugated polymers has significantly increased in recent decades due to their semiconducting properties and promising applications in organic optoelectronics. To date, the extension of linear conjugated polymers into two&#8208;dimensional conjugated polymers (2D CPs), which can also be regarded as 2D &#960;&#8208;conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs), remains largely unexplored due to limited synthetic methodologies. In this work, we demonstrate the first synthesis of vinylene&#8208;linked 2D CPs, namely, 2D poly(phenylenequinoxalinevinylene)s  2D&#8208;PPQV1  and  2D&#8208;PPQV2  ,  via  the Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons (HWE) reaction of  C  2  &#8208;symmetric 1,4&#8208;bis(diethylphosphonomethyl)benzene or 4,4'&#8208;bis(diethylphosphonomethyl)biphenyl with  C  3  &#8208;symmetric 2,3,8,9,14,15&#8208;hexa(4&#8208;formylphenyl)diquinoxalino[2,3&#8208;  a  :2',3'&#8208;  c  ]phenazine as monomers. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations unveil the crucial role of the initial reversible C&#8208;C single bond formation for the synthesis of crystalline 2D CPs. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) studies and nitrogen adsorption&#8208;desorption measurements demonstrate the formation of proclaimed crystalline, dual&#8208;pore structures with surface areas of up to 440 m  2  /g.

In their Communication (DOI: &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.20200484610.1002/anie.202004846&lt;/a&gt;), H.&#8197;M. Chen, Y. Zheng, S.&#8197;Z. Qiao, and co&#8208;workers use in&#8197;situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure and in&#8197;situ Raman techniques to show that trace iodine and positively charged copper species better stabilize the ethoxy intermediate, which was found to be the selectivity&#8208;determining intermediate towards ethane production.

      <title>Directional bonding in {Nb10} inorganic frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;oxo clusters offer opportunity to assemble inorganic and metal&#8208;organic frameworks by a controlled building&#8208;block approach, which led to the revolutionary discoveries of zeolites and MOFs. Polyoxometalate clusters are soluble in water, but more challenging to link into frameworks&#8212;the inert oxo&#8208;caps that provide solubility are resistant to replacement or further connectivity. Here we demonstrate how the unique directional bonding and varying basicity of the decaniobate ([Nb10]) oxo&#8208;caps can be exploited to build 1D, 2D, and 3D inorganic frameworks. In nine structures, A+ (A=Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs), AE2+ (AE=Ca, Sr, Ba) and Mn2+ demonstrate that the dimensionality of the obtained material is controlled by cation charge and size. Increased cation charge decreases selectivity for oxo&#8208;site bonding, leading to higher&#8208;dimensional linking. Larger cation radii also decreases bonding selectivity, yielding higher dimensional materials. Ion&#8208;exchange studies of the A+&#8208;Nb10 family shows exclusive selectivity for Cs+ over other alkalis, important for radioactive&#8208;Cs removal and sequestration.</dc:description>

Unlike BCBs bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, which react with nucleophiles at the &#946;&#8208;position, BCB&#8208;Bpin reacts with a diverse set of heteroatom (O, S, N)&#8208;centred nucleophiles exclusively at the &#945;&#8208;position.

      <title>Dual Intramolecular Electron Transfer for In Situ Coreactant&#8208;Embedded Electrochemiluminescence Microimaging of Membrane Protein</title>
      <dc:description>The demand for transporting coreactant to emitter and short lifetime of the radicals in electrochemiluminescence (ECL) emission inhibit greatly its application in cytosensing and microscopic imaging. Herein we designed a dual intramolecular electron transfer strategy and tertiary amine conjugated polymer dots (TEA&#8208;Pdots) to develop a coreactant&#8208;embedded ECL mechanism and microimaging system. The TEA&#8208;Pdots could produce ECL emission at +1.2 V without need of coreactant in test solution. The superstructure and intramolecular electron transfer led to unprecedented ECL strength, which was 132 and 45 times stronger than those from the mixture of Pdots with TEA at equiv  alent and 62.5 times higher amounts, respectively. The ECL efficiency was even higher than that of typical [Ru(bpy) 3  ] 2+  system. Therefore, this strategy and coreactant&#8208;embedded ECL system could be used for in situ ECL microimaging of membrane protein on single living cells without additional permeable treatment for transporting coreactant. The feasibility and validity were demonstrated by evaluating the specific protein expression on cell surface. This work opens new avenues for ECL applications in single cell analysis and dynamic study of biological events.</dc:description>

      <title>Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Symmetry&#8208;Tuned Polarity and Photocatalytic Activity</title>
      <dc:description>The polarity of a semiconducting molecule dominantly affects its intrinsic photophysical properties, which can be tuned by varying the molecular geometry. Herein, we developed a  D3h&#8208;symmetric tricyanomesitylene as a new monomer which could be reticulated into a vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (g&#8208;C54N6&#8208;COF) via Knoevenagel condensation with another  D3h&#8208;symmetric monomer 2,4,6&#8208;tris(4&#8242;&#8208;formyl&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine. Meanwhile, replacing tricyanomesitylene with a  C2v&#8208;symmetric 3,5&#8208;dicyano&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylpyridine gave birth to a less&#8208;symmetric vinylene&#8208;linked COF (g&#8208;C52N6&#8208;COF). The octupolar conjugated characters of  g&#8208;C54N6&#8208;COF  were reflected in its scarce solvatochromic effects either in ground or excited states, and endowed it with more promising semiconducting behaviors as compared with  g&#8208;C52N6&#8208;COF, such as enhanced light&#8208;harvesting and excellent photo&#8208;induced charge generation and separation. Along with the matched energy level,  g&#8208;C54N6&#8208;COF  enabled the two&#8208;half reactions of photocatalytic water splitting with average O2  evolution rate of 51.0 &#956;mol h&#8208;1  g&#8208;1  and H2  evolution rate of 2518.9 &#956;mol h&#8208;1  g&#8208;1. Such values are among the highest of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art COF photocatalysts.</dc:description>

      <title>Hydroxylamine&#8208;derived Reagent as a Dual Oxidant and Amino Group Donor for the Iron Catalyzed Preparation of Unprotected Sulfinamides from Thiols</title>
      <dc:description>An iron catalyzed reaction for the selective transformation of thiols (&#8208;SH) to sulfinamides (&#8208;SONH  2  ) by a direct transfer of &#8208;  O  and free &#8208;  NH  2  groups has been developed. The reaction operates under mild conditions using a bench stable hydroxylamine derived reagent, exhibits broad functional group tolerance, is scalable and proceeds without the use of any precious metal catalyst or additional oxidant. This novel, practical reaction leads to the formation of two distinct new bonds (S=O and S&#8211;N) in a single step to chemoselectively form valuable, unprotected sulfinamide products.

      <title>Non&#8208;metal single&#8208;phosphorus&#8208;atom catalysis of hydrogen evolution</title>
      <dc:description>Non&#8208;metal&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) feature low cost, simple synthesis methods and effective regulation for substrates, while there are few studies on this aspect. Herein, we developed a simplified pressurized gas&#8208;assisted process, and first reported a non&#8208;metal single&#8208;atom phosphorus with atomic&#8208;level dispersion on unique single&#8208;crystal Mo  2  C hexagonal nanosheet arrays with (001) plane exposure supported by carbon sheet (SAP&#8208;Mo  2  C&#8208;CS). The SAP&#8208;Mo  2  C&#8208;CS is structurally stable and shows exceptional electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Because of the bidirectional regulation of single P atoms, P bonds with the surrounding Mo atoms to form a localized electronic state. A so&#8208;called high&#8208;active &#8220;window&#8221; based on the active sites of P atoms and their adjacent Mo atoms shows the &#916;G  H*  close to zero for hydrogen evolution, which is the most ideal &#916;G  H*  reported so far. Meanwhile, the moderate d&#8208;band center value of SAP&#8208;Mo  2  C&#8208;CS can be also used as an ideal standard value to evaluate the HER performance in non&#8208;metal&#8208;based SACs. Our work is investigation of the origin of the HER electrocatalytic activity based on non&#8208;metal&#8208;based SACs, and also provides an efficient strategy to achieve the synthesis and application of non&#8208;metal SACs.</dc:description>

      <title>Transcription Factor Based Small&#8208;Molecule Sensing with a Rapid Cell Phone Enabled Fluorescent Bead Assay</title>
      <dc:description>
The allosteric transcription factor TetR acts as a sensor and actuator in this quantum dot enabled fluorescent bead assay for the small molecule anhydrotetracycline. This rapid, antibody&#8208;free biosensor produces a visible change in fluorescent color, which can be detected by eye or with an inexpensive digital camera, based on dose&#8208;dependent analyte&#8208;responsive protein&#8208;DNA binding. The adaptable sensor uses easily accessible biomolecular components.







Abstract
Recently, allosteric transcription factors (TFs) were identified as a novel class of biorecognition elements for in vitro sensing, whereby an indicator of the differential binding affinity between a TF and its cognate DNA exhibits dose&#8208;dependent responsivity to an analyte. Described is a modular bead&#8208;based biosensor design that can be applied to such TF&#8208;DNA&#8208;analyte systems. DNA&#8208;functionalized beads enable efficient mixing and spatial separation, while TF&#8208;labeled semiconductor quantum dots serve as bright fluorescent indicators of the TF&#8208;DNA bound (on bead) and unbound states. The prototype sensor for derivatives of the antibiotic tetracycline exhibits nanomolar sensitivity with visual detection of bead fluorescence. Facile changes to the sensor enable sensor response tuning without necessitating changes to the biomolecular affinities. Assay components self&#8208;assemble, and readout by eye or digital camera is possible within 5&#8197;minutes of analyte addition, making sensor use facile, rapid, and instrument&#8208;free.

      <title>Activating chalcogen bonding (ChB) in alkylseleno/ alkyltelluroacetylenes toward ChB directionality control</title>
      <dc:description>Activation of a deep electron&#8208;deficient area on chalcogen atoms (Ch = Se, Te) is demonstrated here in alkynyl chalcogen derivatives, in the prolongation of the (C&#8801;)C&#8722;Ch bond. The solid&#8208;state structures of 1,4&#8208;bis(methylselenoethynyl)perfluorobenzene (1Se) show the formation of recurrent chalcogen&#8208;bonded (ChB) motifs. Association of 1Se and the tellurium analog 1Te with 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine and with the stronger Lewis base 1,4&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)piperazine gives 1:1 co&#8208;crystals with 1D extended structures linked by short and directional ChB interactions, comparable to those observed with the corresponding halogen bond (XB) donor, 1,4&#8208;bis(iodoethynyl)&#8208;perfluorobenzene. This &#8220;alkynyl&#8221; approach for chalcogen activation provides the crystal engineering community with efficient, and neutral ChB donors for the elaboration of supramolecular 1D (and potentially 2D or 3D) architectures, with a degree of strength and predictability comparable to that of halogen bonding in iodoacetylene derivatives.</dc:description>

The solid&#8208;state structures of 1,4&#8208;bis(methylselenoethynyl)perfluorobenzene (1Se) show the formation of recurrent chalcogen&#8208;bonded (ChB) motifs. Association of 1Se and the tellurium analog 1Te with 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine and with the stronger Lewis base 1,4&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)piperazine gives 1:1 co&#8208;crystals with 1D extended structures linked by short and directional ChB interactions, comparable to those observed with the corresponding halogen bond (XB) donor, 1,4&#8208;bis(iodoethynyl)&#8208;perfluorobenzene. This &#8220;alkynyl&#8221; approach for chalcogen activation provides the crystal engineering community with efficient, and neutral ChB donors for the elaboration of supramolecular 1D (and potentially 2D or 3D) architectures, with a degree of strength and predictability comparable to that of halogen bonding in iodoacetylene derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Mediating Reaction Orthogonality in Polymer and Materials Science</title>
      <dc:description>
Selective regulation of multiple reaction pathways in complex chemical systems is crucial for modern syntheses. This Review presents strategies for activating such reactions in polymer and materials science, with an emphasis on systems activated via photochemical stimuli.







Abstract
Selective control of chemical reactions is critical for the proper regulation of processes ranging from intricate biological systems to large scale industrial manufacturing. The progression of synthetic chemistry toward the complexity seen in Nature requires increased control over many concurrent chemical reactions in a non&#8208;interfering (orthogonal) fashion. Fortunately, the practically endless pool of synthetic chemical reactions developed to date can often be combined in an orthogonal manner to provide elegant solutions to complex chemical problems. In this review, we first highlight some of the many photochemical reactions that have been applied in orthogonal reaction protocols; the highly selective nature of photochemical reactions makes them well&#8208;suited for independent activation in the presence of other reaction components. The application of these orthogonal reactions, especially photochemical reactions, for the synthesis and modification of polymers and polymeric materials is also summarized. Importantly, the use of orthogonal chemical reactions can provide additional opportunities for synthesizing advanced and functional polymeric materials compared to traditional synthetic procedures.

      <title>Fortified Coiled Coils: Enhancing Mechanical Stability with Lactam or Metal Staples</title>
      <dc:description>Coiled coils (CCs) are powerful supramolecular building blocks for biomimetic materials, increasingly used for their mechanical properties. Here, we introduce helix&#8208;inducing macrocyclic constraints, so&#8208;called staples, to tune thermodynamic and mechanical stability of CCs. We show that thermodynamic stabilization of CCs against helix uncoiling primarily depends on the number of staples, whereas staple positioning controls CC mechanical stability. Inserting a covalent lactam staple at one key force application point significantly increases the barrier to force&#8208;induced CC dissociation and reduces structural deformity. A reversible His&#8208;Ni  2+  &#8208;His metal staple also increases CC stability, but ruptures upon mechanical loading to allow helix uncoiling. Staple type, position and number are key design parameters in using helical macrocyclic templates for fine&#8208;tuning CC properties in emerging biomaterials.</dc:description>

      <title>Bandgap Engineering of Hydroxyl&#8208;Functionalized Borophene for Superior Photo&#8208;Electrochemical Performance</title>
      <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconducting boron nanosheets (few&#8208;layer borophene) have been theoretically predicted, but their bandgap tunability has not been experimentally confirmed. In this study, hydroxyl&#8208;functionalized borophene (borophene&#8208;OH) with tunable bandgap was fabricated by liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation using 2&#8208;butanol solvent. Surface energy matching between boron and 2&#8208;butanol produced smooth borophene, and the exposed unsaturated B sites generated by B&#8208;B bond breaking during exfoliation coordinated with OH groups to form semiconducting borophene&#8208;OH, enabling a tunable bandgap of 0.65&#8211;2.10 eV by varying its thickness. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements demonstrated that the use of borophene&#8208;OH to fabricate working electrodes for PEC&#8208;type photodetectors significantly enhanced the photocurrent density (5.0 &#956;A/cm2) and photoresponsivity (58.5 &#956;A/W) compared with other 2D monoelemental materials. Thus, borophene&#8208;OH is a promising semiconductor with great optoelectronic potential.</dc:description>

      <title>Targeting RNA G&#8208;quadruplex in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2: A Promising Therapeutic Target for COVID&#8208;19?</title>
      <dc:description>COVID&#8208;19 pandemic caused by SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 has become a global threat. Understanding the underlying mechanisms and developing innovative treatments are extremely urgent. G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) are important non&#8208;canonical nucleic acids structures with distinct biofunctions. Here, we studied four putative G4&#8208;forming sequences (PQSs) in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genome. One of them (namely RG&#8208;1), which locates in the coding sequence (CDS) region of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N), has been verified to form stable RNA G4 structure in live cells. G4&#8208;specific compounds, such as PDP, can stabilize RG&#8208;1 G4 and significantly reduce the protein levels of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 N by inhibiting its translation bothin vitro andin vivo. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that PQSs in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 can form G4 structures in live cells, and their biofunctions can be regulated by G4&#8208;specific stabilizer. We expect this finding will provide new insights into developing novel antiviral drugs against COVID&#8208;19.</dc:description>

      <title>Surface Interrogation of Electrodeposited MnOx and CaMnO3 Perovskites by Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy: Probing Active Sites and Kinetics for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Here we report the surface interrogation scanning electrochemical microscopy (SI&#8208;SECM) of two electrodeposited manganese&#8208;based electrocatalysts, amorphous MnOx and perovskite CaMnO3, to investigate the manganese oxidation state relating to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under neutral conditions. The results indicate the amounts of Mn(III) and Mn(IV) species in MnOx and CaMnO3 depend on potential. A Mn(V) species was identified in both structures during the OER. Time&#8208;delay titration of Mn(V) further revealed that MnOx produced two types of active sites with different OER reactions rates, k&#8217;fast(MnOx) = 1.21 s&#8208;1 and k&#8217;slow(MnOx) = 0.24 s&#8208;1. In contrast, CaMnO3 perovskites in which the Mn(V) species formed at a less positive potential than that in MnOx, displayed only one kinetic behavior with a faster reaction rate of 1.72 s&#8208;1.</dc:description>

      <title>Modulating single&#8208;atom Pd sites with Cu for enhanced ambient ammonia electrosynthesis</title>
      <dc:description>The electrochemical reduction of N  2  to NH  3  is emerging as a promising alternative for sustainable and distributed production of NH  3  . However, the development has been impeded by difficulties in N  2  adsorption, protonation of *NN and inhibition of competing hydrogen evolution. To address the issues, we design a catalyst with diatomic Pd&#8208;Cu sites on N&#8208;doped carbon by modulation of single&#8208;atom Pd sites with Cu. The introduction of Cu not only shifts the partial density states of Pd toward the Fermi level but also promote the d&#8208;2&#960;* coupling between Pd and adsorbed N  2  , leading to enhanced N  2  chemisorption, activated protonation and suppressed hydrogen evolution. As a result, the catalyst achieves a high Faradaic efficiency of 24.8 &#177; 0.8% and a desirable NH  3  yield rate of 69.2 &#177; 2.5 &#956;g h  &#8208;1  mg  cat.  &#8208;  1  , far outperforming the individual single&#8208;atom Pd catalyst.

      <title>Zwitterionic Polydopamine Engineered Interface for In Vivo Sensing with High Biocompatibility</title>
      <dc:description>Electrochemical sensing performance is often compromised by electrode biofouling (e.g., protein nonspecific binding) in complex biological fluids; however, the design and construction of a robust biointerface with superior antifouling ability and high tolerance of free radicals and excellent electrochemical performance remains a great challenge. Herein, inspired by nature, we demonstrate a robust polydopamine&#8208;engineered biointerfacing, to tailing zwitterionic molecules (i.e., sulfobetaine methacrylate, SBMA) through Michael Addition. The SBMA&#8208;PDA biointerface can resist nonspecific binding of proteins in complex biological fluids while enhancing interfacial electron transfer and electrochemical stability of the electrode. In addition, this sensing interface can be integrated with tissue&#8208;implantable microelectrode for  in vivo  analysis, preserving more than 92.0% of the initial sensitivity after 2 h of implantation in brain tissue and showing low acute neuroinflammatory responses. Moreover, this implantable microsensor demonstrates good stability both in normal and in Parkinson's disease (PD) rat brain tissue. This PDA&#8208;engineered zwitterionic biointerface is believed to be used to construct universal interface enabling wide analytical application  in vivo  with improved sensing performance.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Current plasmonic photocatalysts are mainly based on noble metal nanoparticles and rarely work in the infrared (IR) light range. Here, cost&#8208;effective Bi  2  O  3&#8208;  x  with oxygen vacancies was formed  in situ  on commercial bismuth powder by calcination at 453.15 K in atmosphere. Interestingly, defects introduced into Bi  2  O  3&#8208;  x  simultaneously induced a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in the wavelength range of 600&#8208;1400 nm and enhanced the adsorption for CO  2  molecules, which enabled efficient photocatalysis of CO  2  &#8208;to&#8208;CO (~100% selectivity) even under low&#8208;intensity near&#8208;IR light irradiation. Significantly, the apparent quantum yield for CO evolution at 940 nm reached 0.113%, which is approximately 4.0 times that found at 450 nm. We also showed that the unique LSPR allows for the realization of a nearly linear dependence of photocatalytic CO production rate on light intensity and operating temperature.

      <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Photoresponsive Molecular Amphiphiles in Aqueous Media</title>
      <dc:description>Amphiphilic molecules, comprising hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties and the intrinsic propensity to self&#8208;assemble in aqueous environment, sustain a fascinating spectrum of structures and functions ranging from biological membranes to ordinary soap. Facing the challenge to design responsive, adaptive, and out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium systems in water, the incorporation of photoresponsive motifs in amphiphilic molecular structures offers ample opportunity to design supramolecular systems that enables functional responses in water in a non&#8208;invasive way using light. Here, we discuss the design of photoresponsive molecular amphiphiles, their self&#8208;assembled structures in aqueous media and at air&#8208;water interfaces, and various approaches to arrive at adaptive and dynamic functions in isotropic and anisotropic systems, including motion at the air&#8208;water interface, foam formation, reversible nanoscale assembly, and artificial muscle function. Controlling the delicate interplay of structural design, self&#8208;assembling conditions and external stimuli, these responsive amphiphiles open several avenues towards application such as soft adaptive materials, controlled delivery or soft actuators, bridging a gap between artificial and natural dynamic systems.</dc:description>

      <title>Liquid&#8208;free all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn batteries and encapsulation&#8208;free flexible batteries enabled by in&#8208;situ constructed polymer electrolyte</title>

Developing completely liquid&#8208;free all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn batteries needs high&#8208;quality solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs).

The  in&#8208;plane  interdigital&#8208;structure device with electrolyte completely exposed to open atmosphere can be stably operated for over 30 days almost without weight loss and electrochemical performance decay. Furthermore, the sandwich&#8208;structure device can normally operate over 40 min under fire condition. Meanwhile, the interfacial impedance and the capacity using  in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed  SPEs retain almost unchanged after various bending tests, a key criterion for flexible/wearable devices.

      <title>Structural basis for &#945;&#8208;helix mimicry and inhibition of protein&#8208;protein interactions with oligourea foldamers</title>

Among the different options, foldamers, sequence&#8208;based oligomers with precise folded conformation, have emerged as a promising technology.

      <title>Turning on Zn 4s Electrons in a N2&#8208;Zn&#8208;B2 Configuration to Stimulate Remarkable ORR Performance</title>
      <dc:description>Zn based single atom catalyst has been recently explored with distinguished stability, of which the fully occupied Zn  2+  3d  10  4s  2  electronic configuration is Fenton reaction inactive, but the catalytic activity is thus inferior.

We confirm both experimentally and theoretically that the unique N2&#8208;Zn&#8208;B2 configuration is crucial, in which Zn  +  (3d  10  4s  1  ) can hold enough delocalized electrons to generate suitable binding strength for key reaction intermediates and promote the charge transfer between catalytic surface and ORR reactants. This exclusive effect is not found in the other transition metal counterparts such as M&#8208;B/N&#8208;C (M=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni and Cu). &#160;Consequently, the as obtained catalyst demonstrate impressive ORR activity, along with remarkable long&#8208;term stability in both alkaline and acid media.

      <title>Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Aldol Reaction: Post&#8208;Aldol Stereochemistry Control and Formation of Quaternary Stereogenic Centers</title>
      <dc:description>The dominated approaches for asymmetric aldol reactions have primarily focused on the aldol carbon&#8208;carbon bond forming events. Here we postulate and develop a new catalytic strategy that seeks to modulate the reaction thermodynamics and control the product enantioselectivities via post&#8208;aldol processes. Specifically, a NHC catalyst is used to activate a masked enolate substrate (vinyl carbonate) to promote the aldol reaction in a non&#8208;enantioselective manner. This aldol event is subsequently followed by a dynamic kinetic resolution process that is mediated by the same (chiral) NHC catalyst without introducing any additional substance. This post&#8208;aldol process takes care of the enantioselectivity issues and drives the otherwise reversible aldol reaction toward a complete conversion. The acylated aldol products bearing quaternary/tetrasubstituted carbon stereogenic centers are formed in good yields and high optical purities.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The dominated approaches for asymmetric aldol reactions have primarily focused on the aldol carbon&#8208;carbon bond forming events. Here we postulate and develop a new catalytic strategy that seeks to modulate the reaction thermodynamics and control the product enantioselectivities via post&#8208;aldol processes. Specifically, a NHC catalyst is used to activate a masked enolate substrate (vinyl carbonate) to promote the aldol reaction in a non&#8208;enantioselective manner. This aldol event is subsequently followed by a dynamic kinetic resolution process that is mediated by the same (chiral) NHC catalyst without introducing any additional substance. This post&#8208;aldol process takes care of the enantioselectivity issues and drives the otherwise reversible aldol reaction toward a complete conversion. The acylated aldol products bearing quaternary/tetrasubstituted carbon stereogenic centers are formed in good yields and high optical purities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Quantitative Protein Corona Composition and Dynamics on Carbon Nanotubes in Biological Environments</title>
      <dc:description>When nanoparticles enter biological environments, proteins adsorb to form the &#8220;protein corona&#8221; which causes significant changes in biodistribution and toxicity. Herein, we measure protein corona formation on DNA&#8208;functionalized single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (ssDNA&#8208;SWCNTs), a nanoparticle ideal for sensing and delivery, in blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. We characterize corona composition by mass spectrometry, revealing high&#8208;abundance corona proteins involved in lipid binding, complement activation, and coagulation. We investigate roles of electrostatic and entropic interactions driving selective corona formation. Lastly, we study real&#8208;time protein binding on ssDNA&#8208;SWCNTs, obtaining agreement between enriched proteins binding strongly and depleted proteins binding marginally, while highlighting cooperative adsorption mechanisms. Knowledge of protein corona composition, formation mechanisms, and dynamics informs nanoparticle translation from  in vitro  design to  in vivo  application.</dc:description>

      <title>Molecular Zinc Hydride Cations [ZnH]+: Synthesis, Structure, and CO2 Hydrosilylation Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Protonolysis of thermally unstable and insoluble [ZnH2]n with the conjugated Br&#248;nsted acid of the bidentate diamine TMEDA (N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine) and TEEDA (N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetraethylethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine) gave the zinc hydride cation [(L2)ZnH]+, isolable either as the mononuclear THF adduct [(L2)ZnH(thf)]+[BArF4]&#8208; (L2 = TMEDA; BArF4&#8208; = [B(3,5&#8208;(CF3)2&#8208;C6H3)4]&#8208;) or as the dimer [{(L2)Zn)}2(&#956;&#8208;H)2]2+[BArF4]&#8208;2 (L2 = TEEDA). In contrast to [ZnH2]n, the cationic zinc hydrides are thermally stable and soluble in THF. [(L2)ZnH]+ was also shown to form di&#8208; and trinuclear adducts of the elusive neutral [(L2)ZnH2] containing both terminal and bridging hydrido ligands. All hydride&#8208;containing cations readily inserted CO2 to give the corresponding formate complexes. [(TMEDA)ZnH]+[BArF4]&#8208; catalyzed the hydrosilylation of CO2 with tertiary hydrosilanes to give stepwise formoxy silane, methyl formate, and methoxy silane. The unexpected formation of methyl formate was shown to result from the zinc&#8208;catalyzed transesterification of methoxy silane with formoxy silane, which was eventually converted into methoxy silane as well.</dc:description>
