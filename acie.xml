         <title>A SLC35C2 Transporter&#8208;Targeting Fluorescent Probe for the Selective Detection of B Lymphocytes Identified by SLC&#8208;CRISPRi and Unbiased Fluorescence Library Screening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>T and&#160; B lymphocytes are two major adaptive immune cells in&#160; the&#160; h uman defense system. To real&#8208;time monitor their diverse functions, a live&#8208;cell&#8208;selective probe for only one cell type would be a great tool for&#160; investigating&#160; the complex interaction of the immune cells. Here, we presented a small molecule probe&#160;  CDyB  &#160;for live B cells distinction over T cells by an unbiased fluorescence library screening. The cell selectivity was confirmed by multiparametric single&#8208;cell analysis using CyTOF among different lymphocytes. Through a systematic SLC&#8208;CRISPRi library screening, the molecular target of&#160;  CDyB  &#160;was identified as SLC35C2 transporter based on Gating&#8208;Oriented Live&#8208;cell Distinction (GOLD) mechanism. The gene expression analysis and knock&#8208;out experiments validated that the SLC35C2 transporter was the responsible target&#160; for &#160;  CDyB  &#160;distinction. &#160; Interestingly, when&#160;  CDyB  &#160;was applied to study B cell development, the&#160;  CDyB  &#160;fluorescence and&#160;  Slc35c2  &#160;expression were positively correlated with the B cell maturation process, and not involved in the T cell development.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereogradient Poly(Lactic Acid) from meso&#8208;Lactide / L&#8208;Lactide Mixtures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The production of L&#8208;lactide from L&#8208;lactic acid involves a substantial formation of  meso  &#8208;lactide as an impurity, and, upon polymerization with the industrial catalyst tin octanoate, results in poly(L&#8208;lactic acid) of reduced crystallinity due to stereoerrors randomly distributed along the polymer chains. We describe a new approach wherein, instead of avoiding stereoerrors by removing the  meso  &#8208;lactide prior to polymerization, the stereoerrors in the polymer are tolerated, by crowding them in a stereogradient copolymer. A zirconium complex of an amine tris(phenolate) ligand is found to exhibit very high syndioselectivity in the ring opening polymerization catalysis of  meso  &#8208;lactide at room temperature, and gives rise to stereogradient copolymers in the polymerization of mixtures of  meso  &#8208;lactide / L&#8208;lactide in the melt at 180 &#176;C. Relative to the stereo&#8208;random copolymers obtained with tin octanoate, the stereogradient copolymers exhibit enhanced crystallinities manifested in lower solubilities and higher melting temperatures and enthalpies.</dc:description>

         <title>Role&#8208;Specialized Division of Labor in CO2&#160;Reduction with Doubly&#8208;Functionalized Iron Porphyrin Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In enzymes, the active site residues function differently to promote chemical reactions. Such &#160; a&#160; role&#8208;specialized division of labor has been rarely realized by synthetic catalysts. We reported herein on catalytic CO  2  &#160;reduction with Fe porphyrins decorated with two cationic&#160;  N,N,N  &#8208;trimethylbenzylamine groups in&#160;  cis  &#8208; or&#160;  trans  &#8208;arrangement. The&#160;  cis  &#8208;isomer outperforms the&#160;  trans  &#8208;isomer and reaches a TOF  max  &#160;of 4.4 &#215; 10  5  &#160;s  &#8722; 1  &#160;in acetonitrile using phenol proton source. Theoretical studies revealed that the two cationic units in the&#160;  cis  &#8208;isomer are more effective than single cationic unit to improve the CO  2  &#160;binding, and more importantly, they function differently but cooperatively to promote the C&#8208;O bond cleavage: one interacts with the CO  2  &#8208;adduct, while the other one interacts with the phenol molecule through electrostatic interactions. This work therefore presents a significant example of synthetic catalysts, which boost chemical reactions using role&#8208;specialized strategy for substrate activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of Strain Relaxation on 2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has reached the commercial standards, the unsatisfactory stability limits their further application. Hydrophobic interface and encapsulation can block the damage of water and oxygen, while the instability induced by intrinsic residual strain remains inevitable. Here, the residual strain in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (RP) perovskite film is investigated by X&#8208;ray diffraction and atomic force microscope. It&#8217;s found that the spacer cations contribute to the residual strain even though they are not in the inorganic cages. Benefited from strain relaxation, the film quality is improved, leading to suppressed recombination, promoted charge transport and enhanced efficiency. More significantly, the strain&#8208;released devices maintain 86% of initial efficiency after kept in air with 85% relative humidity (RH) for 1080 h, 82% under maximum power point (MPP) tracking at 50&#176;C for 804 h and 86% after continuous heating at 85&#176;C for 1080 h.</dc:description>

         <title>Creating Frustrated Lewis Pairs in Defective Boron Carbon Nitride for Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) on metal&#8208;free catalysts is an attractive alternative to the industrial Haber&#8208;Bosch process. However, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts still suffer from low Faraday efficiencies and low ammonia yields. Herein, we present a molecular design strategy to develop a defective boron carbon nitride (BCN) catalyst with the abundant unsaturated B and N atoms as Lewis acid and base sites, which upgrades the catalyst from a single &#8220;Lewis acid catalysis&#8221; to &#8220;frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) catalysis.&#8221;  14  N  2  /  15  N  2  exchange experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that FLPs can adsorb an N  2  molecule to form a six&#8208;membered ring intermediate, which enables the cleavage of N  2  via a pull&#8211;pull effect, thereby significantly reducing the energy barrier to &#8208;0.82 eV. Impressively, BCN achieves a high Faraday efficiency of 18.9%, an ammonia yield of 20.9 &#956;g h  &#8208;1  mg  &#8208;1  cat.  , and long&#8208;term durability.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Four&#8208;Component Carbonylation of Ethers and Olefins: Direct Access to &#947;&#8208;Oxy Esters and Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new nickel&#8208;catalyzed four&#8208;component carbonylation of ethers with olefins to synthesize &#947;&#8208;substituted carbonyl compounds has been developed. A variety of &#947;&#8208;substituted carbonyl compounds were produced in excellent yields under 1&#8197;atm pressure of CO. Notably, this strategy has been successfully applied to the one&#8208;step synthesis of the drug molecule Naftidrofuryl, which is a medicine for the treatment of cerebrovascular disease (CVD).







Abstract
Multi&#8208;component carbonylation of olefins, a reaction that installs both a carbon&#8211;carbon(heteroatom) bond and a carbonyl group across the double bond, is an attractive strategy for alkene functionalization. Herein, we developed a novel nickel&#8208;catalyzed four&#8208;component carbonylation of olefins with ethers under low CO gas pressure. Using alcohols and amines as the reaction partner, diverse &#947;&#8208;oxy&#8208;substituted esters and amides were produced in good yields with excellent functional group tolerance. Notably, Naftidrofuryl, a medicine for the treatment of cerebrovascular disease (CVD), can be synthesized by this process straightforwardly.

         <title>An Oxazine&#8208;Based Fluorogenic Probe with Changeable &#960;&#8208;Conjugation to Eliminate False&#8208;Positive Interference of Albumin and Its Application to Sensing Aminopeptidase&#8197;N</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxazine&#8208;based fluorogenic probe with a changeable &#960;&#8208;conjugated system for sensing the enzyme aminopeptidase N was developed, which effectively eliminated the false&#8208;positive interference of albumin. The probe was used to detect the enzyme in cells, human serum and the mouse urine without the influence of albumin.







Abstract
Many fluorophores/probes suffer from the interference of albumin in biosystems. Herein, we propose an effective strategy to overcome this interference by virtue of both an albumin&#8208;insensitive fluorophore and its changeable &#960;&#8208;conjugation, and demonstrate the strategy by designing an oxazine&#8208;based fluorogenic probe for aminopeptidase&#8197;N (APN). The modification on the N atom in the oxazine fluorophore with alanine through a cleavable linker locks the resulting probe in a non&#8208;conjugated, colorless and non&#8208;fluorescent state, so the non&#8208;specific interaction of albumin produces no spectroscopic response. APN can selectively cleave the alanine moiety, restoring the large &#960;&#8208;conjugation and strong fluorescence. The capability of the probe to eliminate the albumin influence has been demonstrated by imaging APN in different cell lines, and by quantitatively determining APN in human serum and mouse urine. The present strategy may be useful for developing more specific fluorogenic probes for other enzymes.

         <title>Working Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries at 80&#8201;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The working feasibility at 80&#8201;&#176;C and 100&#8201;&#176;C of zinc&#8211;air batteries is demonstrated in this work. The operation of zinc&#8211;air batteries under high&#8208;temperature working conditions is systemically investigated. The electrolyte conductivity, the cathode and anode kinetics, and the anode anti&#8208;passivation are optimized at high temperatures, whereas declined anode Faraday efficiency originating from strengthened HER serves as the main bottleneck.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8211;air batteries possess inherent safety and are especially commendable facing high&#8208;temperature working conditions. However, their working feasibility at high temperatures has seldom been investigated. Herein, the working feasibility of high&#8208;temperature zinc&#8211;air batteries is systemically investigated. The effects of temperature on air cathode, zinc anode, and aqueous electrolyte are decoupled to identify the favorable and unfavorable factors. Specifically, parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction strengthens at high temperatures and leads to declined anode Faraday efficiency, which is identified as the main bottleneck. Moreover, zinc&#8211;air batteries demonstrate cycling feasibility at 80&#8201;&#176;C. This work reveals the potential of zinc&#8211;air batteries to satisfy energy storage at high temperatures and guides further development of advanced batteries towards harsh working conditions.

         <title>Molecular Stacking on Graphene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first prototype of spatially defined graphene 2D hetero&#8208;architectures bearing vertically aligned multiple molecular bricks is realized based on a proposed &#8220;molecular building blocks&#8221; concept. The constructed nano&#8208;assemblies exhibit structural hierarchies across multiple height scales and versatile properties. The results represent a breakthrough and open the door for future construction of promising patterned 3D architectures.







Abstract
The sequential vertical polyfunctionalization of 2D addend&#8208;patterned graphene is still elusive. Here, we report a practical realization of this goal via a &#8220;molecular building blocks&#8221; approach, which is based on a combination of a lithography&#8208;assisted reductive functionalization approach and a post&#8208;functionalization step to sequentially and controllably link the molecular building blocks ethylpyridine, cis&#8208;dichlorobis(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)ruthenium, and triphenylphosphine (4&#8208;methylbenzenethiol, respectively) on selected lattice regions of a graphene matrix. The assembled 2D hetero&#8208;architectures are unambiguously characterized by various spectroscopic and microscopic measurements, revealing the stepwise stacking of the molecular building blocks on the graphene surface. Our method overcomes the current limitation of a one&#8208;layer&#8208;only binding to the graphene surface and opens the door for a vertical growth in the z&#8208;direction.

         <title>Enhancing the Release Efficiency of a Molecular Chemotherapeutic Prodrug by Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mitochondria&#8208;targeted molecular prodrug, namely CS&#8208;P, was designed and synthesized to demonstrate the feasibility of using the PDT process to effectively promote the release of hypoxia&#8208;activated drugs. The experimental results indicated that CS&#8208;P can be selectively activated by tumor hypoxia to release chemotherapeutic drugs and photosensitizers, and then further release chemotherapeutic drugs after light irradiation. The design strategy proposed provides a new idea for enhancing hypoxia&#8208;activated prodrugs release.







Abstract
Tumor&#8208;specific, hypoxia&#8208;activated prodrugs have been developed to alleviate the side effects of chemotherapy drugs. However, the release efficiency of hypoxia&#8208;activated prodrugs is restricted by the degree of tumor hypoxia, which further leads to poor cancer treatment effects. On the other hand, oxygen is consumed gradually in photodynamic therapy (PDT), which aggravates hypoxia at the tumor site. In this study, we combined hypoxia&#8208;activated prodrugs with PDT agents to promote the prodrugs release, thereby improving their bioavailability and therapeutic effects. As a proof of concept, a mitochondria&#8208;targeted molecular prodrug, CS&#8208;P, was designed and synthesized. It can be selectively activated by tumor hypoxia to release chemotherapeutic drugs and photosensitizers, and then further discharge drugs after light irradiation. The design strategy proposed in this paper provides a new idea for enhancing hypoxia&#8208;activated prodrug release and real&#8208;time monitoring prodrug release.

         <title>A Non&#8208;Alkaline Electrolyte for Electrically Rechargeable Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries with Long&#8208;term Operation Stability in Ambient Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrically rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries attract extensive research interests due to their potentially high energy density and low cost but suffer from chemical instability and poor electrochemical reversibility caused by the corrosive nature of the conventional alkaline electrolyte.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electrically rechargeable zinc-air batteries attract extensive research interests due to their potentially high energy density and low cost but suffer from chemical instability and poor electrochemical reversibility caused by the corrosive nature of the conventional alkaline electrolyte.

         <title>Revisiting the Dithenophthalimide Building Block: Improved Synthetic Method Yielding New High&#8208;Performance Polymer Donors of Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imide&#8208;functionalized arenes have been one of&#160;the most promising acceptor (A) units in organic solar cells (OSCs). However, dithienophthalimide (DPI), a hybrid of thieno&#8208;[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole&#8208;4,6&#8208;dione (TPD) and bithiophene imide (BTI) units, has not been revisited since its first synthesis, likely owing&#160;to the high synthetic&#160;cost of the reported method. In this work, we simplified the synthetic procedure of the DPI skeleton with a significant reduction of the synthetic cost by using chromium&#8208;mediated cyclization as the key chemistry. Using this method, two DPI&#8208;based nonhalogenated D&#8722;A copolymers are synthesized. The binary OSCs based on pBDTT&#8208;DPI&#8208;Me:Y6 achieves a power conversion efficiency as high as 16.55%, highlighting DPI as an attractive A&#8208;unit for further exploration in&#160;OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>An Activity&#8208;Based Fluorescent Probe for Imaging Fluctuations of Peroxynitrite (ONOO&#8208;) in the Alzheimer's Disease Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peroxynitrite (ONOO  &#8208;  ) plays a critical role in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the association between ONOO  &#8208;  and AD is inexplicit. To reveal the ONOO  &#8208;  influxes in AD brains, an activatable activity&#8208;based fluorescence probe  Rd&#8208;DPA3  was rationally designed by a structure&#8208;modulated strategy. Taking advantage of ONOO  &#8208;  &#8208;sparked two&#8208;step cascade reactions of a novel chemical trigger,  Rd&#8208;DPA3  specifically responds to ONOO  &#8208;  among 0.3 mM other ROS and varied proteins, accompanied by an intensive fluorescence enhancement (  F/F  0  = 50). Moreover, with the mitochondria&#8208;targeting ability,  Rd&#8208;DPA3  can efficiently monitor the alternations of intracellular ONOO  &#8208;  levels in the cerebral cells during oxidative stress. Significantly, due to NIR emission and superb blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) crossing ability,  Rd&#8208;DPA3  is capable of  in vivo  imaging cerebral ONOO  &#8208;  influxes and illustrating an age&#8208;dependent accumulation of native ONOO  &#8208;  in AD mice brains. This work discloses that  Rd&#8208;DPA3  would be beneficial for AD diagnosis, treatment evaluation, and potential pathogenesis study.</dc:description>

         <title>Cathodic Radical Cyclisation of Aryl Halides Using a Strongly&#8208;Reducing Catalytic Mediator in Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electro&#8208;reductive radical cyclisation of aryl halides affords the corresponding hetero&#8208; and carbo&#8208;cycles in an undivided flow reactor equipped with steel and carbon electrodes using an organic mediator. A dissolving metal anode is not needed, and the mediator can be employed in sub&#8208;stoichiometric amount (0.05 equiv), increasing the practical utility of cathodic radical cyclisation. The methodology is applied to O&#8208;, N&#8208;, and C&#8208;tethers, yielding tricyclic fused and spiro systems. In the absence of mediator, the major pathway is hydrogenolysis of the C&#8212;X bond, a 2e  &#8211;  process occurring at the cathode. Predominance of the radical pathway in presence of a strongly reducing mediator (  M  ) is consistent with homogeneous electron&#8208;transfer in a reaction layer detached from the cathode surface, where the flux of  M  &#8226;&#8211;  leaving the electrode is such that little aryl halide reaches the cathode.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Oxygen Transfer from H2O to Cyclooctene over Electron&#8208;Rich RuO2 Nanocrystals for Epoxidation and Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Production of more than 20 million tons of epoxides per year from olefins suffers a low atomic economy due to the use of oxidants and complex catalysts with unsatisfied selectivity, leading to huge environmental and economic costs. Herein, we present the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application of electron&#8208;rich RuO  2  nanocrystals to boost the highly selective epoxidation of cyclooctene via the direct oxygen transfer from water as the sole oxygen source under mild conditions. The enhanced electron enrichment of RuO  2  nanocrystals by Schottky effect with nitrogen&#8208;doped carbons largely promotes the capture and activation of cyclooctene to give a high turnover frequency (260 h  &#8208;1  ) of cyclooctene oxide, far surpassing the reported values (&lt;20 h  &#8208;1  ) of bench&#8208;marked catalysts at room temperature with oxidants. Our electron&#8208;rich RuO  2  electrocatalysts enable efficient and durable hydrogen production (Faradaic efficiency &gt;90%) on the cathode without scarifying the selectivity to epoxide (&gt;99%) on the anode.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Free N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are generally prepared by treatment of imidazolium precursors with strong alkali reagents, which usually produces inactive NHC dimers and would destroy the porous supports and thus make them to be difficult in recovery and reuse. Herein, we report the first stable CO2&#8208;masked N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) grafted on a porous crystalline covalent organic framework (COF). The stable NHC&#8208;CO2 moieties in the COF&#8208;NHC&#8208;CO2 could be transformed in situ into isolated NHCs by heating, which exhibits superior catalytic performances in the hydrosilylation and N&#8208;formylation reactions with CO2. More interestingly, the NHC sites can reversibly form NHC&#8208;CO2 and thus can be easily recycled and reused while maintaining excellent catalytic activity. The density functional theory calculations revealed that NHC sites can be fully exposed after removal of CO2&#8208;masks and rapidly react with silanes, which endows COF&#8208;NHC with high catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Directed Dehydration as Synthetic Tool for Generation of a New Na4SnS4 Polymorph: Crystal Structure, Na+ Conductivity, and Influence of Sb&#8208;Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dehydration of Na4SnS4&#8901;14&#8201;H2O at moderate temperature generates the new, kinetically stabilized Na4SnS4 polymorph exhibiting enhanced ionic conductivities compared to the thermodynamically stabilized form. Co&#8208;decomposition with Na3SbS4&#8901;9&#8201;H2O enables an easy, fast, and scalable avenue to obtain the solid solution Na4&#8722;xSn1&#8722;xSbxS4 allowing methodical investigations of Sb&#8208;substitution effects in these solid&#8208;state electrolytes.







Abstract
We present the convenient synthesis and characterization of the new ternary thiostannate Na4SnS4 (space group 
) by directed removal of crystal water molecules from Na4SnS4&#8901;14&#8201;H2O. The compound represents a new kinetically stable polymorph of Na4SnS4, which is transformed into the known, thermodynamically stable form (space group 
) at elevated temperatures. Thermal co&#8208;decomposition of mixtures with Na3SbS4&#8901;9&#8201;H2O generates solid solution products Na4&#8722;xSn1&#8722;xSbxS4 (x=0.01, 0.10) isostructural to the new polymorph (x=0). Incorporation of Sb5+ affects the bonding and local structural situation noticeably evidenced by X&#8208;ray diffraction, 119Sn and 23Na NMR, and 119Sn M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrates an enormous improvement of the ionic conductivity with increasing Sb content for the solid solution (&#963;25&#176;C=2&#215;10&#8722;3, 2&#215;10&#8722;2, and 0.1&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for x=0, 0.01, and 0.10), being several orders of magnitude higher than for the known Na4SnS4 polymorph.

&lt;p&gt;Dehydration of Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;SnS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;14&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O at moderate temperature generates the new, kinetically stabilized Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;SnS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; polymorph exhibiting enhanced ionic conductivities compared to the thermodynamically stabilized form. Co-decomposition with Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SbS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;9&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O enables an easy, fast, and scalable avenue to obtain the solid solution Na&lt;sub&gt;4&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present the convenient synthesis and characterization of the new ternary thiostannate Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;SnS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (space group 
) by directed removal of crystal water molecules from Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;SnS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;14&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. The compound represents a new kinetically stable polymorph of Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;SnS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, which is transformed into the known, thermodynamically stable form (space group 
) at elevated temperatures. Thermal co-decomposition of mixtures with Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SbS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;9&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O generates solid solution products Na&lt;sub&gt;4&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Access to Unexplored 3D Chemical Space: cis&#8208;Selective Arene Hydrogenation for the Synthesis of Saturated Cyclic Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel and unexplored saturated cyclic boronic acids were synthesized using an arene hydrogenation methodology. Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed cis&#8208;selective hydrogenation of biologically important molecules comprising benzoxaborole, benzoxaborinin, and benzoxaboripin&#8208;derivatives is reported. The utility of the synthesized molecules was shown by their high tendency to form intermolecular hydrogen bonding and molecular recognition under physiological conditions.







Abstract
A new class of saturated boron&#8208;incorporated cyclic molecules has been synthesized employing an arene&#8208;hydrogenation methodology. cis&#8208;Selective hydrogenation of easily accessible, and biologically important molecules comprising benzoxaborole, benzoxaborinin, and benzoxaboripin derivatives is reported. Among the various catalysts tested, rhodium cyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbene [Rh&#8208;CAAC] (1) pre&#8208;catalyst revealed the best hydrogenation activity confirming turnover number up to 1400 with good to high diastereoselectivity. A broad range of functional groups was tolerated including sensitive substituents such as &#8722;F, &#8722;CF3, and &#8722;silyl groups. The utility of the synthesized products was demonstrated by the recognition of diols and sugars under physiological conditions. These motifs can have a substantial importance in medicinal chemistry as they possess a three&#8208;dimensional structure, are highly stable, soluble in water, form hydrogen bonds, and interact with diols and sugars.

         <title>Pore&#8208;Structure Control in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) for Capture of the Greenhouse Gas SF6 with Record Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) Ni(ina)2 has pore sizes (6&#8197;&#197;) that are perfectly compatible with the kinetic diameter of sulfur hexafluoride (5.2&#8197;&#197;), affording the benchmark binding affinity for this potent greenhouse gas that is used in the electronics industry.







Abstract
In the electronics industry, the efficient recovery and capture of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) from SF6/N2 mixtures is of great importance. Herein, three metal&#8211;organic frameworks with fine&#8208;tuning pore structures, Cu(peba)2, Ni(pba)2, and Ni(ina)2, were designed for SF6 capture. Among them, Ni(ina)2 has perfect pore sizes (6&#8197;&#197;) that are comparable to the kinetic diameter of sulfur hexafluoride (5.2&#8197;&#197;), affording the benchmark binding affinity for SF6 gas. Ni(ina)2 exhibits the highest SF6/N2 selectivity (375.1 at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar) and ultra&#8208;high SF6 uptake capacity (53.5&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K and 0.1&#8197;bar) at ambient conditions. The remarkable separation performance of Ni(ina)2 was verified by dynamic breakthrough experiments. Theoretical calculations and the SF6&#8208;loaded single&#8208;crystal structure provided critical insight into the adsorption/separation mechanism. This porous coordination network has the potential to be used in industrial applications.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Release of Reactive Oxygen Species and NO for Overcoming Biofilm Heterogeneity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A therapeutic strategy to overcome biofilm heterogeneity is presented, in which antibacterial agent (NO) and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) dispersant (reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;inducing Fe3+) are separately loaded in the yolk and shell compartment of a yolk&#8211;shell nanoplatform. The spatiotemporally ordered release manner and pharmacokinetic complementarity of ROS and NO improve the anti&#8208;biofilm outcome synergistically.







Abstract
The heterogeneity in biofilms is a major challenge in biofilm therapies due to different susceptibility of bacteria and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) to antibacterial agents. Here, we describe a therapeutic strategy that overcame biofilm heterogeneity, where antibacterial agent (NO) and EPS dispersant (reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;inducing Fe3+) were separately loaded in the yolk and shell compartment of a yolk&#8211;shell nanoplatform. Compared with traditional combinational chemotherapies which suffer from inconsistent pharmacokinetics profiles, this strategy drew on the pharmacokinetic complementarity of ROS and NO, where ROS with a short diffusion distance and a high redox potential corrupted the EPS, facilitating NO, which has a long diffusion distance and a broad antimicrobial spectrum, to penetrate the biofilm and eliminate the resident bacteria. Additionally, the construction of a three&#8208;dimensional spherical biofilm model is novel and clinically relevant.

         <title>Inducing Ring Complexation for Efficient Capturing and Detection of Small Gaseous Molecules Using SERS for Environmental Surveillance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Practical applications of gas&#8208;phase surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) suffer from poor analyte affinity to plasmonic substrates, low concentration, and inherently small Raman cross&#8208;sections. Herein, ring complexation is leveraged via formation of multiple non&#8208;covalent interactions with small gases to yield effective capture and distinct spectral changes for multiplex detection of SO2 and NO2 in excess of CO2 mimicking artificial exhaust.







Abstract
Gas&#8208;phase surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) remains challenging due to poor analyte affinity to SERS substrates. The reported use of capturing probes suffers from concurrent inconsistent signals and long response time due to the formation of multiple potential probe&#8211;analyte interaction orientations. Here, we demonstrate the use of multiple non&#8208;covalent interactions for ring complexation to boost the affinity of small gas molecules, SO2 and NO2, to our SERS platform, achieving rapid capture and multiplex detection down to 100&#8197;ppm. Experimental and in&#8208;silico studies affirm stable ring complex formation, and kinetic investigations reveal a 4&#8208;fold faster response time compared to probes without stable ring complexation capability. By synergizing spectral concatenation and support vector machine regression, we achieve 91.7&#8201;% accuracy for multiplex quantification of SO2 and NO2 in excess CO2, mimicking real&#8208;life exhausts. Our platform shows immense potential for on&#8208;site exhaust and air quality surveillance.

     alt="Inducing Ring Complexation for Efficient Capturing and Detection of Small Gaseous Molecules Using SERS for Environmental Surveillance"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practical applications of gas-phase surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) suffer from poor analyte affinity to plasmonic substrates, low concentration, and inherently small Raman cross-sections. Herein, ring complexation is leveraged via formation of multiple non-covalent interactions with small gases to yield effective capture and distinct spectral changes for multiplex detection of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in excess of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mimicking artificial exhaust.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gas-phase surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) remains challenging due to poor analyte affinity to SERS substrates. The reported use of capturing probes suffers from concurrent inconsistent signals and long response time due to the formation of multiple potential probe&#8211;analyte interaction orientations. Here, we demonstrate the use of multiple non-covalent interactions for ring complexation to boost the affinity of small gas molecules, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, to our SERS platform, achieving rapid capture and multiplex detection down to 100&#8197;ppm. Experimental and in-silico studies affirm stable ring complex formation, and kinetic investigations reveal a 4-fold faster response time compared to probes without stable ring complexation capability. By synergizing spectral concatenation and support vector machine regression, we achieve 91.7&#8201;% accuracy for multiplex quantification of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in excess CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, mimicking real-life exhausts. Our platform shows immense potential for on-site exhaust and air quality surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlling the Valence&#8208;Electron Arrangement of Nickel Active Centers for Efficient Hydrogen Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The valence&#8208;electron arrangement of Ni active centers can be controlled precisely by introducing Ni vacancies into electrocatalysts for facilitated hydrogen oxidation. Benefiting from the optimized valence&#8208;electron&#8208;orbital interactions with key intermediates, the Ni&#8208;vacancy&#8208;enriched Ni3N exhibited a 15&#8208;fold enhanced mass activity in comparison with Ni3N which has far fewer Ni vacancies.







Abstract
The valence&#8208;electron arrangement of heterogeneous catalysts can significantly affect the binding behavior of absorbates. However, it remains a challenge to understand the role of the valence&#8208;electron arrangement in electrocatalysis, which limits its utilization as a tool to design efficient electrocatalysts. Here, we describe experiments in which the valence&#8208;electron arrangement of Ni active centers for hydrogen oxidation is controlled precisely by using Ni&#8208;vacancy&#8208;enriched Ni3N as a platform. These Ni vacancies can promote the valence&#8208;electron delocalization of OH&#8208;adsorption centers to enhance the Ni&#8201;ds&#8211;O&#8201;2p valence&#8208;electron&#8208;orbital interaction with elevated OH adsorption. Meanwhile, the deficit of valence&#8208;electrons of H&#8208;adsorption centers at Ni vacancies can lower Ni&#8201;ds&#8211;H&#8201;1s interaction with weakened H binding. Relative to Ni3N poor in vacancies, the Ni&#8208;vacancy&#8208;enriched Ni3N showed a mass activity enhanced by 15&#8208;fold. This strategy paves a rational way to design efficient catalysts by finely tuning the valence&#8208;electron arrangement.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free N&#8722;H Bond Activation by Phospha&#8208;Wittig Reagents
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The facile activation of NH3 with the aid of phospha&#8208;Wittig reagents has been demonstrated to give for the first time secondary aminophoshines of the type ArP(H)NH2. Evident from DFT calculations two molecules of NH3 act in concert to facilitate an NH3 for PMe3 exchange and subsequent proton shift. The activation of primary and secondary amines is likewise achieved.







Abstract
N&#8208;containing molecules are mostly derived from ammonia (NH3). Ammonia activation has been demonstrated for single transition metal centers as well as for low&#8208;valent main group species. Phosphinidenes, mono&#8208;valent phosphorus species, can be stabilized by phosphines, giving so&#8208;called phosphanylidenephosphoranes of the type RP(PR&#8242;3). We demonstrate the facile, metal&#8208;free NH3 activation using ArP(PMe3), affording for the first time isolable secondary aminophosphines ArP(H)NH2. DFT studies reveal that two molecules of NH3 act in concert to facilitate an NH3 for PMe3 exchange. Furthermore, H2NR and HNR2 activation is demonstrated.

         <title>Thermally Activated and Aggregation&#8208;Regulated Excitonic Coupling Enable Emissive High&#8208;Lying Triplet Excitons
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two naphthalene&#8208;based luminophores that exhibit room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from a higher&#8208;lying triplet excited state are reported. Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that unusual RTP originates from the multiple accessible triplet excited&#8208;stated conformers, regulated by thermal activation and aggregation. This unique RTP family enables functional temperature sensing.







Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) originating from higher&#8208;lying triplet excitons remains a rather rarely documented occurrence for purely organic molecular systems. Here, we report two naphthalene&#8208;based RTP luminophores whose phosphorescence emission is enabled by radiative decay of high&#8208;lying triplet excitons. In contrast, upon cooling the dominant phosphorescence originates from the lowest&#8208;lying triplet excited state, which is manifested by a red&#8208;shifted emission. Photophysical and theoretical studies reveal that the unusual RTP results from thermally activated excitonic coupling between different conformations of the compounds. Aggregation&#8208;regulated excitonic coupling is observed when increasing the doping concentration of the emitters in poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA). Further, the RTP quantum efficiency improves more than 80&#8208;fold in 1,3&#8208;bis(N&#8208;carbazolyl)benzene (mCP) compared to that in PMMA. This design principle offers important insight into triplet excited state dynamics and has been exploited in afterglow&#8208;indicating temperature sensing.

         <title>Medium Diradical Character, Small Hole and Electron Reorganization Energies and Ambipolar Transistors in Difluorenoheteroles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diradicals are electrically ambipolar owing to the semiaperture of the &#960;&#8208;electron shell which produces redox amphoteric behaviour and small reorganization energies for hole and electron transports.







Abstract
Four difluorenoheteroles having a central quinoidal core with the heteroring varying as furan, thiophene, its dioxide derivative and pyrrole have shown to be medium character diradicals. Solid&#8208;state structures, optical, photophysical, magnetic, and electrochemical properties have been discussed in terms of diradical character, variation of aromatic character and captodative effects (electron affinity). Organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) have been prepared, showing balanced hole and electron mobilities of the order of 10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 or ambipolar charge transport which is first inferred from their redox amphoterism. Quantum chemical calculations show that the electrical behavior is originated from the medium diradical character which produces similar reorganization energies for hole and electron transports. The vision of a diradical as simultaneously bearing pseudo&#8208;hole and pseudo&#8208;electron defects might justify the reduced values of reorganization energies for both regimes. Structure&#8208;function relationships between diradical and ambipolar electrical behavior are revealed.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular modifiers can be used to alter the product selectivity of heterogeneous catalysts for electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction. In this study, immobilisation of a well&#8208;defined pyridine species on a copper catalyst inhibits CO and C2+ product formation, enabling the selective generation of formate at high reaction rates.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction presents a sustainable route to the production of chemicals and fuels. Achieving a narrow product distribution with heterogeneous Cu catalysts is challenging and conventional material modifications offer limited control over selectivity. Here, we show that surface&#8208;immobilised molecular species can act as inhibitors for specific carbon products to provide rational control over product distributions. Combined experimental and computational results showed that anchoring of a thiol&#8208;functionalised pyridine on Cu destabilises a surface&#8208;bound reaction intermediate to energetically block a CO&#8208;producing pathway, thereby favouring formate production. The nitrogen atom was shown to be essential to the inhibition mechanism. The ability of molecules to control selectivity through inhibition of specific reaction pathways offers a unique approach to rationally modify heterogeneous catalysts.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of 2D Hybrid Double Perovskites on 3D Cs2AgBiBr6 Crystals towards Ultrasensitive Detection of Weak Polarized Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembly of 2D/3D lead&#8208;free double perovskite heterocrystals (HCs) is shown here to give the first demonstration of high&#8208;performance polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetection with a large anisotropy ratio (&#8776;9) and weak light resolution.







Abstract
We report the self&#8208;assembly of 2D double perovskite (BLA)2CsAgBiBr7 (BLA=benzylammonium) on 3D Cs2AgBiBr6 crystals, providing the first demonstration of polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetection using lead&#8208;free double perovskite heterocrystals (HCs). The (BLA)2CsAgBiBr7/Cs2AgBiBr6 HC successfully combines the anisotropy of 2D double perovskites with the well&#8208;defined interface provided by heterogeneous integration. Driven by the built&#8208;in electric field in junction, photodetectors of HCs exhibit unique polarization dependence of zero&#8208;bias photocurrent with a large anisotropy ratio up to 9, which is 6&#8197;times amplified as compared to the pristine 2D (BLA)2CsAgBiBr7. More importantly, the present devices can remain polarization&#8208;sensitive with incident light intensity down to the nW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 level. Our study on lead&#8208;free hybrid perovskite HCs marks a step toward establishing robust material foundations for fundamental scientific investigations and the development of optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Guest&#8208;Modulated Circularly Polarized Luminescence by Ligand&#8208;to&#8208;Ligand Chirality Transfer in Heteroleptic PdII Coordination Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrative self&#8208;assembly of PdII cations with an enantiopure helicene&#8208;based ligand and non&#8208;chiral but emissive fluorenone ligands yields a series of Pd2L2L&#8242;2 heteroleptic coordination cages, showing circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from the non&#8208;chiral moiety. Modulation of the chiroptical properties is achieved by ligand modification or guest binding, achieving an up to 4&#8208;fold enhancement of CPL intensity.







Abstract
Multicomponent metallo&#8208;supramolecular assembly allows the rational combination of different building blocks. Discrete multifunctional hosts with an accessible cavity can be prepared in a non&#8208;statistical fashion. We employ our shape&#8208;complementary assembly (SCA) method to achieve for the first time integrative self&#8208;sorting of heteroleptic PdII cages showing guest&#8208;tunable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). An enantiopure helicene&#8208;based ligand (M or P configuration) is coupled with a non&#8208;chiral emissive fluorenone&#8208;based ligand (A or B) to form a series of Pd2L2L&#8242;2 assemblies. The modular strategy allows to impart the chiral information of the helicenes to the overall supramolecular system, resulting in CPL from the non&#8208;chiral component. Guest binding results in a 4&#8208;fold increase of CPL intensity. The principle offers potential to generate libraries of multifunctional materials with applications in molecular recognition, enantioselective photo&#8208;redox catalysis and information processing.

         <title>Spatially Controlled CO2 Conversion Kinetics in Natural Leaves for Motion Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural CO2 conversion can be triggered with high spatial control by shining light on precision&#8208;tailored pristine leaves, as reported by Alexander Kuhn et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202205298). The perfectly site&#8208;selective evolution of oxygen under irradiation, symbolized by the bubbles released at the extremity of a leaf positioned at the air/water interface of a mountain lake, is used to generate significant motion of such all&#8208;natural macro&#8208; and microswimmers.

         <title>Hydrogen Isotope Separation Using a Metal&#8211;Organic Cage Built from Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic cages (MOCs), built from macrocycles, were investigated for the first time for the separation of hydrogen isotopes. The MOC crystal has flexible narrow pores that leads to a separation temperature of over 100&#8197;K even without existing strong adsorption sites.







Abstract
Porous materials that contain ultrafine pore apertures can separate hydrogen isotopes via kinetic quantum sieving (KQS). However, it is challenging to design materials with suitably narrow pores for KQS that also show good adsorption capacities and operate at practical temperatures. Here, we investigate a metal&#8211;organic cage (MOC) assembled from organic macrocycles and ZnII ions that exhibits narrow windows (&lt;3.0&#8197;&#197;). Two polymorphs, referred to as 2&#945; and 2&#946;, were observed. Both polymorphs exhibit D2/H2 selectivity in the temperature range 30&#8211;100&#8197;K. At higher temperature (77&#8197;K), the D2 adsorption capacity of 2&#946; increases to about 2.7&#8197;times that of 2&#945;, along with a reasonable D2/H2 selectivity. Gas sorption analysis and thermal desorption spectroscopy suggest a gate&#8208;opening effect of the MOCs pore aperture. This promotes KQS at temperatures above liquid nitrogen temperature, indicating that MOCs hold promise for hydrogen isotope separation in real industrial environments.

         <title>Expanded Azaporphyrins Consisting of Multiple BODIPY Units: Global Aromaticity and High Affinities Towards Alkali Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;coupling reaction of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;bromo&#8208;BODIPY under Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination conditions has led to the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;bridged cyclic BODIPY tetramer, pentamer, and hexamer. Subsequent oxidation of these BODIPY oligomers with DDQ in the presence of alkali metal ions gave 1, 2, and 3, which show high affinities towards alkali metal ions. Expanded azaporphyrins 1 and 2 display global aromaticity.







Abstract
The one&#8208;pot self&#8208;coupling reaction of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;bromo&#8208;BODIPY 9 under Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination conditions gave nitrogen&#8208;bridged cyclic BODIPY tetramer 10, pentamer 11, and hexamer 12. Oxidation of 10, 11, and 12 in the presence of alkali metal ions provided 13, 15, and 16, respectively, as the first examples of expanded azaporphyrins possessing more than six pyrrole rings. Curiously, the oxidation even in the absence of alkali metal ions gave the same complexes as a result of spontaneous complexation. 10&#8211;12 showed large association constants (104&#8211;106&#8197;M&#8722;1) with K+ and Na+, but the spontaneous complexations were not observed, indicating the extremely high affinities of 13&#8211;16 toward alkali metal ions, which can be ascribed to the multiple and effective ion&#8211;dipole interaction of the alkali metal ion with the negatively polarized F atoms of the BF2 walls surrounding the cavity. Importantly, 13, 14, and 15 show diatropic ring currents as a result of global aromaticity.

         <title>Convergent Synthesis and Anti&#8208;Pancreatic Cancer Cell Growth Activity of a Highly Branched Heptadecasaccharide from Carthamus tinctorius</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first total synthesis of a highly branched heptadecasaccharide moiety of the native bioactive galectin&#8208;3&#8208;targeting polysaccharide from Carthamus tinctorius has been accomplished via a photo&#8208;assisted convergent [6+4+7] one&#8208;pot coupling strategy. This work demonstrates a representative example to explore potential active domains of the polysaccharide for structure&#8211;activity relationship studies, thereby facilitating pharmaceutical development.







Abstract
Bioactive polysaccharides from natural resources target various biological processes and are increasingly used as potential target molecules for drug development. However, the accessibility of branched and long complex polysaccharide active domains with well&#8208;defined structures remains a major challenge. Herein we describe an efficient first total synthesis of a highly branched heptadecasaccharide moiety of the native bioactive galectin&#8208;3&#8208;targeting polysaccharide from Carthamus tinctorius L. as well as shorter fragments of the heptadecasaccharide. The key feature of the approach is that a photo&#8208;assisted convergent [6+4+7] one&#8208;pot coupling strategy enables rapid assembly of the heptadecasaccharide, whereby a photoremovable o&#8208;nitrobenzyl protecting group is used to generate the corresponding acceptor for glycosylation in situ upon ultraviolet radiation. Biological activity tests suggest that the heptadecasaccharide can target galectin&#8208;3 and inhibit pancreatic cancer cell growth.

         <dc:description>
The rational synthesis of high&#8208;nuclearity lanthanide cluster remains challenging. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202205385), Min Feng, Zhiping Zheng et&#8197;al. developed a stepwise synthesis of a high&#8208;nuclearity sodalite cage&#8208;like cluster Er60, guided by judiciously selected anions. The successive introduction of I&#8722;, CO32&#8722;, and NO3&#8722; led to the isolation of three crucial intermediate clusters, namely the wheel&#8208;like Er12, ship&#8208;like Er34, and bowl&#8208;like Er48. The findings opened the &#8220;black box&#8221; of the elusive self&#8208;assembly process and provided mechanistic insights.

         <title>Spatiotemporally Selective Molecular Imaging via Upconversion Luminescence&#8208;Controlled, DNA&#8208;Based Biosensor Technology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview discusses spatiotemporally selective molecular imaging based on engineered light&#8208;activatable DNA biosensors and its further combination with upconversion nanotechnology. Particular attention is paid to the application of this strategy for spatiotemporally controlled subcellular imaging, signal amplification, and regulation of the targeting activity of functional DNA.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;based biosensor technologies have shown great potential in chemical and biological detection. These biosensors have been actively developed as probes for molecular imaging in live cells and in animals, allowing in situ detection of analytes in complex biological systems, elucidation of the roles of key molecules in biological processes, and the development of non&#8208;invasive diagnosis and image&#8208;guided surgery. Despite the progress made, improving the spatial&#8208;temporal precision remains a challenge in this field. In this Minireview, we describe the concepts behind spatiotemporally selective molecular imaging via the combination of engineered, light&#8208;activatable DNA&#8208;based biosensors and upconversion nanotechnology. We then highlight the application of the approach for the spatiotemporally controlled imaging of various targets in specific intracellular organelles, signal amplification, as well as the regulation of targeting activity to receptor proteins. We finally discuss the challenges and perspectives for possible future developments in this emerging field.

An ultrathin anionic covalent organic framework (COF) was constructed homogeneously on the surface of a graphene template via a facile hydrothermal method. Compared with bulk COF powder, the anionic ultrathin COF exhibited the ability to remove cationic organic dyes of different sizes with higher efficiency.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are of great potential as adsorbents owing to their tailorable functionalities, low density and high porosity. However, their intrinsically stacked two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structure limits the full use of their complete surface for sorption, especially the internal pores. The construction of ultrathin COFs could increase the exposure of active sites to the targeted molecules in a pollutant environment. Herein, an ultrathin COF with a uniform thickness of ca. 2&#8197;nm is prepared employing graphene as the surface template. The resulting hybrid aerogel with an ultralow density (7.1&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;3) exhibits the ability to remove organic dye molecules of different sizes with high efficiency. The three&#8208;dimensional (3D) macroporous structure and well&#8208;exposed adsorption sites permit rapid diffusion of solution and efficient adsorption of organic pollutants, thereby, greatly contributing to its enhanced uptake capacity. This work highlights the effect of COF layer thickness on adsorption performance.

         <title>Alternating Terpolymers through Cyclopolymerization and Subsequent Orthogonal Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The alternating radical copolymerization of divinyl monomer A and hex&#8208;5&#8208;enyl vinyl ether (HVE) using reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) is reported. The obtained cyclopolymer B can chemically be further modified by three orthogonal functionalization reactions i.e. thiol&#8208;ene click reaction, amidation and transesterification or acylation to provide access to various alternating ABC&#8208;type terpolymers C.







Abstract
A method for the synthesis of functionalized alternating copolymers by reversible deactivation radical polymerization was developed. Copolymerization by reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer of hexenyl vinyl ether with a novel fluorinated divinyl monomer yields alternating cyclopolymers that can be chemoselectively modified by three distinct orthogonal functionalization reactions. Along the thiol&#8208;ene click reaction and amidation, a third functionalization was achieved via NHC&#8208;catalyzed transesterification or acylation resulting in a small library of ABC&#8208;type alternating terpolymers.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of 2,6&#8208;Dideoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glycosides and &#946;&#8208;Rhamnosides with a Stereodirecting 2&#8208;(Diphenylphosphinoyl)acetyl Group</title>

         <dc:description>
The 2&#8208;(diphenylphosphinoyl)acetyl group is highly stereodirecting for the construction of challenging &#946;&#8208;configured 2,6&#8208;dideoxyglycosides and d/l&#8208;rhamnosides. Its synthetic potential was demonstrated in linear or convergent approaches to relevant complex carbohydrates. Variable&#8208;temperature NMR studies provided evidence that the reaction proceeds by hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated aglycone delivery.







Abstract
Anomeric stereocontrol is usually one of the major issues in the synthesis of complex carbohydrates, particularly those involving &#946;&#8208;configured 2,6&#8208;dideoxyglycoside and d/l&#8208;rhamnoside moieties. Herein, we report that 2&#8208;(diphenylphosphinoyl)acetyl is highly effective as a remote stereodirecting group in the direct synthesis of these challenging &#946;&#8208;glycosides under mild conditions. A deoxy&#8208;trisaccharide as a mimic of the sugar chain of landomycin E was prepared stereospecifically in high yield. The synthetic potential was also highlighted in the synthesis of Citrobacter freundii O&#8208;antigens composed of a [&#8594;4)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;d&#8208;Manp&#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;Rhap(1&#8594;4)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;Rhap&#8208;(1&#8594;] repeating unit, wherein the convergent assembly up to a nonasaccharide was realized with a strongly &#946;&#8208;directing trisaccharide donor. Variable&#8208;temperature NMR studies indicate the presence of intermolecular H&#8208;bonding between the donor and the bulky acceptor as direct spectral evidence in support of the concept of hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated aglycone delivery.

         <title>Suppression of Chain Transfer at High Temperature in Catalytic Olefin Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Living polymerization (PDI 1.04 to 1.08) of ethylene at the record 130&#8201;&#176;C is achieved by completely suppressing the chain transfer using the nickel catalysts bearing the indispensable combination of the major fluorine effect and the minor steric shielding effect. The nickel catalysts are even active at 200&#8201;&#176;C, and enable the formation of semi&#8208;crystalline, ultrahigh&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polyethylene at 150&#8201;&#176;C. The key chain transfer reactions are elucidated by DFT calculations.







Abstract
Living polymerization by suppressing chain transfer is a very useful method for achieving precise molecular weight and structure control. However, the suppression of chain transfer at high temperatures is extremely challenging in any catalytic polymerization. This has been a severe limitation for catalytic olefin polymerization, which is one of the most important chemical reactions. Here, we report the unprecedented living polymerization of ethylene at 130&#8201;&#176;C, with a narrow molecular weight distribution range of 1.04 to 1.08. This is a significant increase in the reaction temperature. Tailor&#8208;made &#945;&#8208;diimine nickel catalysts that exhibit both the steric shielding and fluorine effects play an essential role in this breakthrough. These nickel catalysts are even active at 200&#8201;&#176;C, and enable the formation of semi&#8208;crystalline, ultrahigh&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polyethylene at 150&#8201;&#176;C. Mechanistic insights into the key chain transfer reaction are elucidated by density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Synthesis of an Acidochromic and Nitroaromatic Responsive Hydrazone&#8208;Linked Pillararene Framework by a Macrocycle&#8208;To&#8208;Framework Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brightly emissive hydrazone&#8208;linked covalent polymer platform based on pillar[5]arene&#8208;derived building blocks has been developed for the optical sensing of acidic pH levels as well as nitroaromatic compounds. The macrocyclic acceptors play important roles in improving the sensing sensitivity and durability, thus providing valuable insight for the construction of versatile molecular platforms with innovative structures and designable functions.







Abstract
Tailoring the properties of solid&#8208;state organic luminescent materials using a bottom&#8208;up design principle is highly desirable for many applications. Herein, we present a &#8220;macrocycle&#8208;to&#8208;framework&#8221; strategy to construct macrocycle&#8208;functionalized and hydrazone&#8208;linked functional organic polymers with bright yellowish&#8208;green luminescence and unique solvatochromism behaviors by the condensation of a diacylhydrazine&#8208;functionalized pillar[5]arene with tris(4&#8208;formylbiphenyl)amine. Outperforming their non&#8208;macrocycle&#8208;incorporated counterparts, the pillar[5]arene&#8208;containing materials display amplified sensitivity to acidic conditions with luminescent and colorimetric dual&#8208;modal patterns assisted by the enhanced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), and exhibit satisfactory responsiveness to nitrobenzene compounds through rapid luminescence quenching with high selectivity and a low detection limit, where the sensing process proceeds through multiple dynamic quenching pathways.

         <title>Deciphering the Metal Speciation in Low&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Complexes by IMS&#8208;MS: Application to the Detection of Manganese Superoxide Dismutase Mimics in Cell Lysates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) effectively distinguishes between first&#8208;row divalent transition metal complexes, despite very similar ionic radii of the ions. The speciation study of two Mn&#8208;based superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetics (or mimics) was performed in intricate cell lysates using IMS coupled to mass spectrometry (IMS&#8208;MS). Quantification was performed by comparison with a standard consisting of an analogous 13C6&#8208;CoII heavy ligand.







Abstract
The detection and quantification of exogenous metal complexes are crucial to understanding their activity in intricate biological media. MnII complexes are difficult to detect and quantify because of low association constants, and high lability. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimic (or mimetic) labelled Mn1 is based on a 1,2&#8208;di&#8208;aminoethane functionalized with imidazole and phenolate and has good intrinsic anti&#8208;superoxide, antioxidant and anti&#8208;inflammatory activities in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#8208;activated intestinal epithelial HT29&#8208;MD2 cells, similar to that of its propylated analogue labelled Mn1P. Ion mobility spectrometry&#8208;mass spectrometry (IMS&#8208;MS) is a powerful technique for separating low molecular weight (LMW) metal complexes and can even separate complexes with the same ligand but bound to different divalent metal cations with similar ionic radii. We demonstrated the intracellular presence of the Mn1 and Mn1P complexes, at least partly intact, in lysates of cells incubated with the complexes and estimated the intracellular Mn1P concentration using a Co&#8208;13C6 analogue.

         <title>Tailoring Phase Alignment and Interfaces via Polyelectrolyte Anchoring Enables Large&#8208;Area 2D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailored P3CT&#8208;BA polyelectrolyte is demonstrated to be an efficient hole&#8208;transporting layer for large&#8208;area 2D perovskite solar cells with a power conversion efficiency approaching 18&#8201;%, and large&#8208;area (2&#215;3&#8197;cm2, 5&#215;5&#8197;cm2) 2D perovskite devices are also reported with an impressive efficiency of 14.81&#8201;% and 11.13&#8201;%, respectively.







Abstract
Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper phase 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exhibit improved lifetime while still facing challenges such as phase alignment and up&#8208;scaling to module&#8208;level devices. Herein, polyelectrolytes are explored to tackle this issue. The contact between perovskite and hole&#8208;transport layer (HTL) is important for decreasing interfacial non&#8208;radiative recombination and scalable fabrication of uniform 2D perovskite films. Through exploring compatible butylamine cations, we first demonstrate poly(3&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxybutyl)thiophene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diyl)&#8208;butylamine (P3CT&#8208;BA) as an efficient HTL for 2D PSCs due to its great hydrophilicity, relatively high hole mobility and uniform surface. More importantly, the tailored P3CT&#8208;BA has an anchoring effect and acts as the buried passivator for 2D perovskites. Consequently, a best efficiency approaching 18&#8201;% was achieved and we further first report large&#8208;area (2&#215;3&#8197;cm2, 5&#215;5&#8197;cm2) 2D perovskite minimodules with an impressive efficiency of 14.81&#8201;% and 11.13&#8201;%, respectively.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Doped Quintuple [9]Helicene with Azacorannulene as Core</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two conformers of a novel quintuple [9]helicene with an azabuckybowl as the core were obtained by the deliberate introduction of sulfur heteroatoms into the helical skeleton. The structure&#8211;property relationship of different conformers was investigated through detailed experiment and theoretical calculations. The success of the sulfur&#8208;doped strategy implies the potential of realizing higher multiple [n]helicenes with various conformers.







Abstract
Herein, a hetero(S,N)&#8208;quintuple [9]helicene (SNQ9H) molecule with an azacorannulene core was synthesized, currently representing the highest hetero&#8208;helicene reported in the field of multiple [n]helicenes. X&#8208;ray crystallography indicated that SNQ9H includes not only a propeller&#8208;shaped conformer SNQ9H&#8208;1, but also an unforeseen quasi&#8208;propeller&#8208;shaped conformer SNQ9H&#8208;2. Different conformers were observed for the first time in multiple [n&#8805;9]helicenes, likely owing to the doping of heteroatomic sulfurs in the helical skeletons. Remarkably, the ratio of SNQ9H&#8208;1 to SNQ9H&#8208;2 can be regulated in situ by the reaction temperature. Experimental studies on the photophysical and redox properties of SNQ9H and theoretical calculations clearly demonstrated that the electronic structures of SNQ9H depend on their molecular conformations. The strategy of introducing heteroatomic sulfurs into the helical skeleton may be useful in constructing various conformers of higher multiple [n]helicenes in the future.

         <title>Formation of NaF&#8208;rich Solid Electrolyte Interphase on Na Anode through Additive Induced Anion&#8208;enriched Structure of Na+ Solvation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;capacity sodium (Na) anode suffer from the trouble of dendrite growth due to high reactivity, which can be overcome through inducing stable NaF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, we propose an additive strategy for realizing the anion&#8208;enriched structure of Na+ solvation to obtain NaF&#8208;rich SEI. The electron withdrawing acetyl group in 4&#8208;acetylpyridine (4&#8208;APD) increases the coordination number of PF6&#8208; in Na+ solvation sheath to facilitate PF6&#8208; decompose to NaF. Thus, the NaF&#8208;rich SEI with high mechanical stability and interfacial energy is formed to repress the growth of Na dendrites. With the 4&#8208;APD&#8208;contained electrolyte, the symmetric Na||Na cells show excellent cycling performance over 360 h at 1.0 mA cm&#8208;2. Meanwhile, enhanced stability is also achieved of Na||Na3V2(PO4)2O2F full cells with high Coulombic efficiency (97%) and capacity retention (91%) after 200 cycles.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Double&#8208;cable conjugated polymers with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) electron acceptors are synthesized for use in single&#8208;component organic solar cells (SCOSCs). Through the development of a judicious synthetic pathway, the highly sensitive nature of the 2&#8208;(3&#8208;oxo&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydroinden&#8208;1&#8208;ylidene)malononitrile (IC)&#8208;based electron acceptors in basic and protonic solvents is overcome. In addition, an asymmetric design motif is adopted to optimize the packing of donor and acceptor segments, enhancing charge separation efficiency. As such, the new double&#8208;cable polymers are successfully applied in SCOSCs, providing an efficiency of over 10% with a broad photo response from 300 to 850 nm and exhibiting excellent thermal/light stability. These results demonstrate the powerful design of NIR&#8208;acceptor&#8208;based double&#8208;cable polymers and will enable SCOSCs to enter a new stage.</dc:description>

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Metal Complexes for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;based compounds have been widely used for biomedical applications. Their unique characteristics make them attractive for both therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. However, numerous issues including toxicity, poor aqueous solubility, and unfavorable biodistribution hamper their widespread use. To overcome these drawbacks, the concept of metal&#8208;based prodrugs emerged. This field is particularly developed for applications in oncology. More precisely, tumor&#8208;associated stimuli (e.g., pH variation, redox activity, enzyme overexpression, etc.) have been exploited to trigger the selective delivery of active metal&#8208;based drugs to the tumor site. The main advances in this area are discussed in this review.</dc:description>

         <title>Intermolecular Energy Gap&#8208;Induced Formation of High&#8208;Valent Cobalt Species in CoOOH Surface Layer on Cobalt Sulfides for Efficient Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reduced intermolecular energy gap between the valence band maximum of CoOOH and the conduction band minimum of Co precursors can promote the formation of oxygen evolution reaction (OER)&#8208;active high&#8208;valent Co4+ species, and enhance the OER performance. This finding provides a new design principle for transition metal&#8208;based OER electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts will undergo surface reconstruction to form active oxyhydroxide&#8208;based hybrids, which are regarded as the &#8220;true&#8208;catalysts&#8221; for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Much effort has been devoted to understanding the surface reconstruction, but little on identifying the origin of the enhanced performance derived from the substrate effect. Herein, we report the electrochemical synthesis of amorphous CoOOH layers on the surface of various cobalt sulfides (CoS&#945;), and identify that the reduced intermolecular energy gap (&#916;inter) between the valence band maximum (VBM) of CoOOH and the conduction band minimum (CBM) of CoS&#945; can accelerate the formation of OER&#8208;active high&#8208;valent Co4+ species. The combination of electrochemical and in situ spectroscopic approaches, including cyclic voltammetry (CV), operando electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and Raman, reveals that Co species in the CoOOH/Co9S8 are more readily oxidized to CoO2/Co9S8 than in CoOOH and other CoOOH/CoS&#945;. This work provides a new design principle for transition metal&#8208;based OER electrocatalysts.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Dual&#8208;Metal Site Catalysts for Enhanced CO2 Reduction: Mechanistic Insight into Active Site Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of atomically dispersed and nitrogen coordinated dual&#8208;metal sites (e.g., Ni&#8208;Fe, Fe&#8208;Co, and Ni&#8208;Co) was designed. Among all possible dual&#8208;metal site configurations, the predicted 2N&#8208;bridged (Fe&#8208;Ni)N6 sites exhibited the highest CO2RR activity and promising stability. The optimal dual&#8208;metal sites can decrease the energy barriers for the *COOH adsorption (&#8722;0.34&#8197;eV) and the *CO desorption (0.39&#8197;eV), facilitating CO2 reduction to CO.







Abstract
Carbon&#8208;supported nitrogen&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;metal site catalysts (i.e., M&#8722;N&#8722;C, M: Fe, Co, or Ni) are active for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to CO. Further improving their intrinsic activity and selectivity by tuning their N&#8722;M bond structures and coordination is limited. Herein, we expand the coordination environments of M&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts by designing dual&#8208;metal active sites. The Ni&#8208;Fe catalyst exhibited the most efficient CO2RR activity and promising stability compared to other combinations. Advanced structural characterization and theoretical prediction suggest that the most active N&#8208;coordinated dual&#8208;metal site configurations are 2N&#8208;bridged (Fe&#8208;Ni)N6, in which FeN4 and NiN4 moieties are shared with two N atoms. Two metals (i.e., Fe and Ni) in the dual&#8208;metal site likely generate a synergy to enable more optimal *COOH adsorption and *CO desorption than single&#8208;metal sites (FeN4 or NiN4) with improved intrinsic catalytic activity and selectivity.

A series of gold(I) complexes bearing bulky tri&#8208;(ortho&#8208;biaryl)phosphine ligands were synthesized. They were shown to exhibit remarkable catalytic activities thus demonstrating their value as synthetic tools in organic chemistry.







Abstract
The confinement of a catalytic site is an efficient strategy to control a reaction and modulate its selectivity. In the present work, a new class of structurally simple and easily accessible bulky tri&#8208;(ortho&#8208;biaryl)phosphine ligands were accessed, and their gold(I) complexes synthesized. Their X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and the comparative evaluation of their VBur% and G steric parameters against a series of gold complexes commonly employed in catalysis demonstrated their confined nature. Despite their notable steric congestion, these complexes exhibited remarkable catalytic activities and unusual selectivities, both in nature and level, that make them unique in the field of synthetic homogeneous gold catalysis.

         <title>Sulfone&#8208;Decorated Conjugated Organic Polymers Activate Oxygen for Photocatalytic Methane Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a process of methane conversion photocatalyzed by the sulfone&#8208;decorated conjugated organic polymer, S&#8208;CTTP, light irradiation first induced the homolytic dissociation of S=O bonds in sulfone groups on the catalyst surface to generate free radicals. The radicals drive efficient conversion of 1O2 to H2O2 and then &#8901;OH, for selective oxidation of adsorbed CH4 into CH3OH and HCOOH.







Abstract
Oxidizing CH4 into liquid products with O2 under mild conditions still mainly relies on metal catalysis. We prepared a series of sulfone&#8208;modified conjugated organic polymers and found that the catalyst with proper SVI content (0.10) could drive O2&#8594;H2O2&#8594;&#8901;OH to oxidize CH4 into CH3OH and HCOOH directly and efficiently at room temperature under light irradiation. Experimental results showed that after 4&#8197;h reaction, decomposition rate and residual amounts of H2O2 were 81.21&#8201;% and 4.83&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1 respectively, and CH4 conversion rate was 22.81&#8201;%. Mechanism studies revealed that illumination could induce the homolytic dissociation of S=O bonds on catalyst to produce oxygen and sulfur radicals, where the &#8901;O could adsorb and activate CH4, and the &#8901;S could supply electrons for 1O2 to generate H2O2 and then for decomposing the H2O2 into &#8901;OH timely to oxidize CH4. This research provided a novel organic catalysis approach for oxygen activation and utilization.

Experimental results showed that after 4&#8197;h reaction, decomposition rate and residual amounts of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; were 81.21&#8201;% and 4.83&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; respectively, and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; conversion rate was 22.81&#8201;%. Mechanism studies revealed that illumination could induce the homolytic dissociation of S=O bonds on catalyst to produce oxygen and sulfur radicals, where the &#8901;O could adsorb and activate CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and the &#8901;S could supply electrons for &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to generate H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and then for decomposing the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into &#8901;OH timely to oxidize CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. This research provided a novel organic catalysis approach for oxygen activation and utilization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Adatom Bonding Sites in a Nickel&#8208;Fe3O4(001) Single&#8208;Atom Model Catalyst and O2 Reactivity Unveiled by Surface Action Spectroscopy with Infrared Free&#8208;Electron Laser Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
With surface&#8208;sensitive action spectroscopy and DFT simulations, the binding site of Ni single atoms on Fe3O4(001) has been elucidated. These Ni single atoms can activate O2 to superoxide in contrast to bare Fe3O4(001) and subsurface Ni atoms in Fe3O4(001).







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom (SA) catalysis presently receives much attention with its promise to decrease the cost of the active material while increasing the catalyst's performance. However, key details such as the exact location of SA species and their stability are often unclear due to a lack of atomic level information. Here, we show how vibrational spectra measured with surface action spectroscopy (SAS) and density functional theory (DFT) simulations can differentiate between different adatom binding sites and determine the location of Ni and Au single atoms on Fe3O4(001). We reveal that Ni and Au adatoms selectively bind to surface oxygen ions which are octahedrally coordinated to Fe ions. In addition, we find that the Ni adatoms can activate O2 to superoxide in contrast to the bare surface and Ni in subsurface positions. Overall, we unveil the advantages of combining SAS and DFT for improving the understanding of single&#8208;atom catalysts.

         <title>Crystalline Porphyrazine&#8208;Linked Fused Aromatic Networks with High Proton Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new fused aromatic network has a highly stable and crystalline structure (denoted as Pz&#8208;FAN) in which pyrazine&#8208;based building blocks are used to form porphyrazine (Pz) linkages via an irreversible reaction with physicochemical stability. The newly prepared Pz&#8208;FAN displayed a high magnitude (1.16&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) of proton conductivity, and maximum power and current densities of 192&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 481&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively.







Abstract
Fused aromatic networks (FANs) have been studied in efforts to overcome the low physicochemical stability of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), while preserving crystallinity. Herein, we describe the synthesis of a highly stable and crystalline FAN (denoted as Pz&#8208;FAN) using pyrazine&#8208;based building blocks to form porphyrazine (Pz) linkages via an irreversible reaction. Unlike most COFs and FANs, which are synthesized from two different building blocks, the new Pz&#8208;FAN is formed using a single building block by self&#8208;cyclotetramerization. Controlled and optimized reaction conditions result in a highly crystalline Pz&#8208;FAN with physicochemical stability. The newly prepared Pz&#8208;FAN displayed a high magnitude (1.16&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) of proton conductivity compared to other reported FANs and polymers. Finally, the Pz&#8208;FAN&#8208;based membrane was evaluated for a proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), which showed maximum power and current densities of 192&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 481&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively.

         <title>Protein Flexibility and Dissociation Pathway Differentiation Can Explain Onset of Resistance Mutations in Kinases

Gleevec has the same binding affinity yet different dissociation times against Wild&#8208;Type and N368S&#8208;mutated Abl kinase. All&#8208;atom enhanced molecular dynamics simulations explain why.







Abstract
Understanding how mutations render a drug ineffective is a problem of immense relevance. Often the mechanism through which mutations cause drug resistance can be explained purely through thermodynamics. However, the more perplexing situation is when two proteins have the same drug binding affinities but different residence times. In this work, we demonstrate how all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations using recent developments grounded in statistical mechanics can provide a detailed mechanistic rationale for such variances. We discover dissociation mechanisms for the anti&#8208;cancer drug Imatinib (Gleevec) against wild&#8208;type and the N368S mutant of Abl kinase. We show how this point mutation triggers far&#8208;reaching changes in the protein's flexibility and leads to a different, much faster, drug dissociation pathway. We believe that this work marks an efficient and scalable approach to obtain mechanistic insight into resistance mutations in biomolecular receptors that are hard to explain using a structural perspective.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Self&#8208;Assembly of Chloride&#8208; and Ion&#8208;Pair&#8208;Templated Cryptates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of urea&#8208;based diols and simple orthoesters allowed the dynamic covalent encapsulation of the chloride ion and the simultaneous encapsulation of both ions present in cesium chloride.







Abstract
While supramolecular hosts capable of binding and transporting anions and ion pairs are now widely available, self&#8208;assembled architectures are still rare, even though they offer an inherent mechanism for the release of the guest ion(s). In this work, we report the dynamic covalent self&#8208;assembly of tripodal, urea&#8208;based anion cryptates that are held together by two orthoester bridgeheads. These hosts exhibit affinity for anions such as Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722; or I&#8722; in the moderate range that is typically advantageous for applications in membrane transport. In unprecedented experiments, we were able to dissociate the Cs&#8901;Cl ion pair by simultaneously assembling suitably sized orthoester hosts around the Cs+ and the Cl&#8722; ion.

         <title>Charge Separation by Creating Band Bending in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Improved Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A representative metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), MIL&#8208;125&#8208;NH2, was integrated with MoO3 or V2O5. Given their suited work functions and energy levels, band bending of the MOF occurs, giving rise to improved charge separation. Accordingly, the activity of the MOF composites toward photocatalytic H2 production is considerably enhanced. This is an unprecedented report with evidence on semiconductor&#8208;like band bending of MOFs.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been intensively studied as a class of semiconductor&#8208;like materials in photocatalysis. However, band bending, which plays a crucial role in semiconductor photocatalysis, has not yet been demonstrated in MOF photocatalysts. Herein, a representative MOF, MIL&#8208;125&#8208;NH2, is integrated with the metal oxides (MoO3 and V2O5) that feature appropriate work functions and energy levels to afford the corresponding MOF composites. Surface photovoltage results demonstrate band bending in the MOF composites, which gives rise to the built&#8208;in electric field of MIL&#8208;125&#8208;NH2, boosting the charge separation. As a result, the MOF composites present 56 and 42&#8197;times higher activities, respectively, compared to the pristine MOF for photocatalytic H2 production. Upon depositing Pt onto the MOF, &#8764;6&#8197;times higher activity is achieved. This work illustrates band bending of MOFs for the first time, supporting their semiconductor&#8208;like nature, which would greatly promote MOF photocatalysis.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Parameritannin&#8197;A2, a Branched Epicatechin Tetramer with Two Double Linkages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By overcoming steric constraints, a stereoselective total synthesis of the branched tetramer parameritannin&#8197;A2 was achieved. As a key step of the approach, a Pummerer/Friedel&#8211;Crafts cascade enabled the de novo construction of the middle flavan unit for its regioselective linkage to the bottom flavan unit.







Abstract
The first total synthesis of parameritannin&#8197;A2 (1), a branched epicatechin (EC) tetramer is reported. The &#8220;phloroglucinol trick&#8221; was used to circumvent two synthetic issues encountered when assembling four EC units, namely, the steric constraint and the formation of the C4&#8722;C6 interflavan linkage. As a substructure of the middle EC unit, phloroglucinol enabled the single&#8208;step assembly of two EC units (top and side) through A&#8208;type linkages. The middle EC unit was constructed by conducting a newly developed three&#8208;carbon flavan annulation via a Pummerer/Friedel&#8211;Crafts cascade reaction to furnish a trimeric intermediate bearing a thio&#8208;leaving group at C4 position, which allowed the final installation of the bottom EC unit.

         <title>Disorder&#8211;Order Conversion&#8208;Induced Enhancement of Thermal Stability of Pyroxene Near&#8208;Infrared Phosphors for Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ordering structures favor crystal rigidity which helps to develop highly efficient and thermally stable near&#8208;infrared phosphors. Disordering structures contain local soft regions, lowering the thermal stability. In changing from CaScAlSiO6&#8201;:&#8201;Cr3+ to the more rigid CaMgSi2O6&#8201;:&#8201;Cr3+, the thermal stability continuously improved allowing the development of NIR phosphors with weak thermal quenching and high efficiency.







Abstract
The minimization of thermal quenching, which leads to luminescence loss at high temperatures, is one of the most important issues for near&#8208;infrared phosphors. In the present work, we investigated the properties of near&#8208;infrared Ca(Sc,Mg)(Al, Si)O6&#8201;:&#8201;Cr3+ phosphors with a pyroxene&#8208;type structure under blue light excitation. The CaScAlSiO6&#8201;:&#8201;Cr3+ end member of Ca(Sc,Mg)(Al,Si)O6&#8201;:&#8201;Cr3+ phosphor led to broadband emission at a full&#8208;width half maximum of 215&#8197;nm, whereas the CaMgSi2O6&#8201;:&#8201;Cr3+ end member exhibited high thermal stability at 150&#8201;&#176;C, with an intensity of 88.4&#8201;% of that at room temperature. The structural analysis and density functional theory calculations revealed the absence of soft conformations and local space confinement contributed to the high structural rigidity and weakened the thermal quenching effect.

         <title>Bioinspired Design of seco&#8208;Chlorin Photosensitizers to Overcome Phototoxic Effects in Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic seco&#8208;chlorin (ZnBPL) can overcome detrimental phototoxic side effects arising from the slow metabolism of photosensitizer in photodynamic therapy (PDT). Upon irradiation, an elaborate control toggle between oxygen photosensitization and oxidative degradation of tetrapyrrole photosensitizer in a molecular entity enables effective therapeutic treatment and avoids the subsequent photosensitivity observed in many clinical PDT cases.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a non&#8208;invasive treatment modality against a range of cancers and nonmalignant diseases, however one must be aware of the risk of causing phototoxic reactions after treatment. We herein report a bioinspired design of next&#8208;generation photosensitizers (PSs) that not only effectively produce ROS but undergo fast metabolism after treatment to overcome undesirable side effects. We constructed a series of &#946;&#8208;pyrrolic ring&#8208;opening seco&#8208;chlorins, termed beidaphyrin (BP), beidapholactone (BPL), and their zinc(II) derivatives (ZnBP and ZnBPL), featuring intense near&#8208;infrared absorption and effective O2 photosensitization. Irradiation of ZnBPL led to a non&#8208;cytotoxic, metabolizable beidaphodiacetamide (ZnBPD) via in situ generated O2.&#8722; but not 1O2, as revealed by mechanistic studies including time&#8208;resolved absorption, kinetics, and isotope labeling. Furthermore, water&#8208;soluble ZnBPL showed an effective therapeutic outcome, fast metabolism, and negligible phototoxic reactions.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Enantioselective Carbo&#8208;Esterification of Styrenes Enabled by a Perfluoroalkylated&#8208;PyBox Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The radical enantioselective carbo&#8208;esterification of styrenes enabled by a newly developed perfluoroalkylated&#8208;PyBox ligand and copper catalysis is reported. Mechanistic studies reveal that this reaction is a rare example of an efficient ligand&#8208;decelerated system, in which the ligand decelerates the reaction, but the reaction is still efficient with reduced amounts of ligand.







Abstract
Chiral lactones are found in many natural products. The reaction of simple alkenes with iodoacetic acid is a powerful method to build lactones, but the enantioselective version of this reaction has not been implemented to date. Herein, we report the efficient catalytic radical enantioselective carbo&#8208;esterification of styrenes enabled by a newly developed CuI&#8208;perfluoroalkylated PyBox system. Simple styrenes have been converted to useful chiral lactones, whose synthetic applications are showcased. Mechanistic studies reveal that this reaction is a rare example of an efficient ligand&#8208;decelerated system, in which the ligand decelerates the reaction, but the reaction is still efficient with reduced amounts of ligand. This uncommon catalytic system may inspire further consideration of the effect of ligands in asymmetric catalysis.

     alt="Copper-Catalyzed Radical Enantioselective Carbo-Esterification of Styrenes Enabled by a Perfluoroalkylated-PyBox Ligand"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The radical enantioselective carbo-esterification of styrenes enabled by a newly developed perfluoroalkylated-PyBox ligand and copper catalysis is reported. Mechanistic studies reveal that this reaction is a rare example of an efficient ligand-decelerated system, in which the ligand decelerates the reaction, but the reaction is still efficient with reduced amounts of ligand.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiral lactones are found in many natural products. The reaction of simple alkenes with iodoacetic acid is a powerful method to build lactones, but the enantioselective version of this reaction has not been implemented to date. Herein, we report the efficient catalytic radical enantioselective carbo-esterification of styrenes enabled by a newly developed Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;-perfluoroalkylated PyBox system. Simple styrenes have been converted to useful chiral lactones, whose synthetic applications are showcased. Mechanistic studies reveal that this reaction is a rare example of an efficient ligand-decelerated system, in which the ligand decelerates the reaction, but the reaction is still efficient with reduced amounts of ligand. This uncommon catalytic system may inspire further consideration of the effect of ligands in asymmetric catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biocatalytic Enantioselective &#946;&#8208;Hydroxylation of Unactivated C&#8722;H Bonds in Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids</title>

Directed evolution rendered P450BS&#946; capable of &#946;&#8208;hydroxylating unactivated C&#8722;H bonds in aliphatic carboxylic acids with broad substrate scope and excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and enantioselectivity. The crystal structure of the evolved variant rationalizes the improved reactivity and selectivity. This study demonstrates the potential of exploring biocatalysts to fulfill reactions that are otherwise elusive with chemical strategies.







Abstract
Catalytic selective hydroxylation of unactivated aliphatic (sp3) C&#8722;H bonds without a directing group represents a formidable task for synthetic chemists. Through directed evolution of P450BS&#946; hydroxylase, we realize oxyfunctionalization of unactivated C&#8722;H bonds in a broad spectrum of aliphatic carboxylic acids with varied chain lengths, functional groups and (hetero&#8208;)aromatic moieties in a highly chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselective fashion (&gt;30 examples, C&#946;/C&#945;&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1, &gt;99&#8201;% ee). The X&#8208;ray structure of the evolved variant, P450BS&#946;&#8208;L78I/Q85H/G290I, in complex with palmitic acid well rationalizes the experimentally observed regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity, and also reveals a reduced catalytic pocket volume that accounts for the increased reactivity with smaller substrates. This work showcases the potential of employing a biocatalyst to enable a chemical transformation that is particularly challenging by chemical methods.

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes and Their Complexes by Chloronium Ion Abstraction from 2&#8208;Chloroazolium Salts Using Electron&#8208;Rich Phosphines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chloronium ion abstraction from 2&#8208;chloroimidazolium salts using tris(1,3&#8208;tert&#8208;butylimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenamino)phosphine 1 rapidly affords the free N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) and chlorophosphonium ions (1&#8208;Cl)+. The dechlorination can be used for the site&#8208;selective metallation of unsymmetric 2&#8208;chloroazole/2&#8208;chloroazolium bis&#8208;NHC precursors by phosphine&#8208;mediated chloronium ion abstraction followed by an oxidative addition reaction to give heterobimetallic complexes.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are commonly prepared by deprotonation of azolium salts using strong anionic bases. This reaction is often unselective, yielding alkali metal NHC complexes or dimerized NHCs. Alternatively, free NHCs are obtained by the dechlorination of 2&#8208;chloroazolium salts using electron&#8208;rich phosphines. PPh3, PCy3, and PtBu3 are unsuitable for Cl+ abstraction, while the sterically encumbered tris(1,3&#8208;tert&#8208;butylimidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenamino)phosphine 1 selectively removes Cl+ from 2&#8208;chloroazolium salts. Since bulky 1 does not bind to metal complexes, it was used for the preparation of NHC complexes via in&#8197;situ Cl+ abstraction from 2&#8208;chloroazolium salts. The dechlorination was employed for the site&#8208;selective monometallation with IrI, IrIII, RhI, RhIII, and RuII of a bis&#8208;NHC precursor composed of a 2&#8208;chlorobenzimidazolium and a 2&#8208;chlorobenzimidazole group, followed by the preparation of the heterobimetallic IrIII/PdII complex [18](BF4)2 by a dechlorination/oxidative addition reaction sequence.

The thermal dehydration of secondary alcohols to carbenes and reverse back&#8208;hydration are showcased. The in situ generation of cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes through the thermal 1,1&#8208;dehydration of secondary pyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ol alcohols was realized and utilized for various purposes such as the synthesis of transition metal&#8208;carbene complexes. This methodology opens a door for further consideration of various secondary alcohols as sources of carbenes.







Abstract
Herein we report secondary pyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ols as a source of cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAAC) for the synthesis of CAAC&#8208;CuI&#8208;complexes and cyclic thiones when reacted with CuI&#8208;salts and elemental sulfur, respectively, under reductive elimination of water from the carbon(IV)&#8208;center. This result demonstrates a convenient and facile access to CAAC&#8208;based CuI&#8208;salts, which are well known catalysts for different organic transformations. It further establishes secondary alcohols to be a viable source of carbenes&#8212;realizing after 185&#8197;years Dumas&#8217; dream who tried to prepare the parent carbene (CH2) by 1,1&#8208;dehydration of methanol. Addressed is also the reactivity of water towards CAACs, which proceeds through an oxidative addition of the O&#8722;H bond to the carbon(II)&#8208;center. This emphasizes the ability of carbon&#8208;compounds to mimic the reactivity of transition&#8208;metal complexes: reversible oxidative addition and reductive elimination of the O&#8722;H bond to/from the C(II)/C(IV)&#8208;centre.

         <title>Electrostatically Directed Long&#8208;Range Self&#8208;Assembly of Nucleotides with Cationic Nanoparticles To Form Multifunctional Bioplasmonic Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A slow and steady aggregation process unveils the ability of ATP and other nucleotides to undergo a long&#8208;range self&#8208;assembly process in the presence of cationic gold nanoparticles and divalent ions. The inherent properties of ATP and AuNP are well retained in the self&#8208;assembled bioplasmonic network.







Abstract
Precise control over interparticle interactions is essential to retain the functions of individual components in a self&#8208;assembled superstructure. Here, we report the design of a multifunctional bioplasmonic network via an electrostatically directed self&#8208;assembly process involving adenosine 5&#8242;&#8208;triphosphate (ATP). The present study unveils the ability of ATP to undergo a long&#8208;range self&#8208;assembly in the presence of cations and gold nanoparticles (AuNP). Modelling and NMR studies gave a qualitative insight into the major interactions driving the bioplasmonic network formation. ATP&#8208;Ca2+ coordination helps in regulating the electrostatic interaction, which is crucial in transforming an uncontrolled precipitation into a kinetically controlled aggregation process. Remarkably, ATP and AuNP retained their inherent properties in the multifunctional bioplasmonic network. The generality of electrostatically directed self&#8208;assembly process was extended to different nucleotide&#8211;nanoparticle systems.

The present study unveils the ability of ATP to undergo a long-range self-assembly in the presence of cations and gold nanoparticles (AuNP). Modelling and NMR studies gave a qualitative insight into the major interactions driving the bioplasmonic network formation. ATP-Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; coordination helps in regulating the electrostatic interaction, which is crucial in transforming an uncontrolled precipitation into a kinetically controlled aggregation process. Remarkably, ATP and AuNP retained their inherent properties in the multifunctional bioplasmonic network. The generality of electrostatically directed self-assembly process was extended to different nucleotide&#8211;nanoparticle systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Biodegradable Iridium(III) Coordination Polymer for Enhanced Two&#8208;Photon Photodynamic Therapy Using an Apoptosis&#8211;Ferroptosis Hybrid Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biodegradable iridium(III) coordination polymer IrS NPs was developed to trigger an apoptosis and ferroptosis hybrid cell death pathway and achieve tumor suppression in two&#8208;photon photodynamic therapy. Additionally, the changes in luminescence lifetime between monomer and polymer allow phosphorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (PLIM) imaging for targeted photodynamic therapy (PDT). These properties combine to make IrS NPs highly effective anticancer PDT agents.







Abstract
The clinical application of photodynamic therapy is hindered by the high glutathione concentration, poor cancer&#8208;targeting properties, poor drug loading into delivery systems, and an inefficient activation of the cell death machinery in cancer cells. To overcome these limitations, herein, the formulation of a promising IrIII complex into a biodegradable coordination polymer (IrS NPs) is presented. The nanoparticles were found to remain stable under physiological conditions but deplete glutathione and disintegrate into the monomeric metal complexes in the tumor microenvironment, causing an enhanced therapeutic effect. The nanoparticles were found to selectively accumulate in the mitochondria where these trigger cell death by hybrid apoptosis and ferroptosis pathways through the photoinduced production of singlet oxygen and superoxide anion radicals. This study presents the first example of a coordination polymer that can efficiently cause cancer cell death by apoptosis and ferroptosis upon irradiation, providing an innovative approach for cancer therapy.

         <title>Hybrid Pyridine&#8211;Pyridone Foldamer Channels as M2&#8208;Like Artificial Proton Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and efficient PyBOP&#8208;mediated one&#8208;pot copolymerization generates a unique family of aromatic amide foldamer&#8208;based helically folded organic nanotubes. These channels facilitate ultrafast and exceptionally selective transmembrane proton transport that likely proceeds via an unprecedented transport mechanism, where a proton may create its own channel&#8208;spanning water chain from two or more short water chains to facilitate its own transmembrane transport.







Abstract
Currently, completely abiotic channel systems that concurrently reproduce the high selectivity and high permeation rate of natural protein channels are rare. Here, we provide one such biomimetic channel system, i.e., a novel family of helically folded hybrid amide foldamers that can serve as powerful artificial proton channels to mimic key transport features of the exceptionally selective Matrix&#8208;2 (M2) proton channels. Possessing an angstrom&#8208;scale tubular pore 3&#8197;&#197; in diameter, these low water permeability artificial channels transport protons at a rate 1.22 and 11&#8197;times as fast as gramicidin A and M2 channels, respectively, with exceptionally high selectivity factors of 167.6, 122.7, and 81.5 over Cl&#8722;, Na+, and K+ ions. Based on the experimental and computational findings, we propose a novel proton transport mechanism where a proton may create a channel&#8208;spanning water chain from two or more short water chains to facilitate its own transmembrane flux via the Grotthuss mechanism.

         <title>One&#8208;Step C2H4 Purification from Ternary C2H6/C2H4/C2H2 Mixtures by a Robust Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Customized Pore Environment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of nonpolar pore environment and accessible active sites in a metal&#8211;organic framework affords benchmark C2H6/C2H4 selectivity and realizes one&#8208;step C2H4 purification from ternary C2H6/C2H4/C2H2 mixtures.







Abstract
One&#8208;step C2H4 purification from ternary C2H6/C2H4/C2H2 mixtures by a single adsorbent is of great industrial significance, but few adsorbents achieve this separation. Herein, we report a robust metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) that possesses methyl&#8208;decorated nonpolar pores and shows one&#8208;step C2H4 purification (purity &gt;99.9&#8201;%) from binary C2H6/C2H4 mixtures and ternary C2H6/C2H4/C2H2 mixtures. The methyl groups in pores provide a suitable pore environment to simultaneously enhance the adsorption capacity for C2H2 and C2H6 compared to C2H4. Simulations revealed the multiple interactions between C2H6 or C2H2 molecules and the pore wall, while the interactions with C2H4 molecules are weak and also unfavorable due to the repulsion from methyl groups in pores. The MOF displays high C2H6 and C2H2 uptakes and benchmark C2H6/C2H4 selectivity (2.2), surpassing all of the reported MOFs for one&#8208;step C2H4 purification from ternary C2H6/C2H4/C2H2 mixtures.

         <title>Programming Receptor Clustering with DNA Probabilistic Circuits for Enhanced Natural Killer Cell Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA probabilistic circuits were engineered to precisely regulate artificial receptor clustering on the cell membrane, which could allow modulation of the natural killer cell&#8211;cancer cell interactions to promote efficient cancer cell killing. This study provides an effective tool for precise control over cellular recognition and cell&#8208;based immunotherapy.







Abstract
Developing strategies to enhance the recognition ability of immune cells is important to the success of cell&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy. Herein, we report programming receptor clustering on membrane with DNA probabilistic circuits for enhanced immune cell recognition. By designing the circuit output to activate receptors for binding to adjacent receptors, we can engineer DNA probabilistic circuits for programmable regulation of receptor clustering. The generated receptor clusters show higher binding affinity to target cancer cells and improved membrane&#8208;anchoring stability compared with monomers. We demonstrate that programming receptor clustering could allow to modulate the recognition capability of natural killer cells and control natural killer cell&#8211;cancer cell interactions to promote efficient cancer cell killing. This work provides insights for precise control over cellular recognition and opens new opportunities for the development of cell&#8208;based immunotherapy.

         <title>Delicate and Fast Photochemical Surface Modification of 2D Photoresponsive Organosilicon Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>

A crystalline 2D Si&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) film was prepared with photoresponsive hexamethyltrisilane groups anchored to its surface. The fluorescence of the resulting film was turned on by UV light irradiation which causes a superhydrophobic&#8208;to&#8208;hydrophilic transformation. Fluorescent patterns, such as QR codes and logos, could be easily etched onto the MOF film endowing it with luminescent and hydrophilic patterns.







Abstract
Photoresponsive arylsilanes have been fascinating molecules for decades because of their unique photophysical characteristics and surface chemistry. Here we report the synthesis and fabrication of a crystalline two&#8208;dimensional trisilyl metal&#8211;organic framework (TSiMOF) orderly installed with the classical photoresponsive hexamethyltrisilane groups on the surface. Irradiated by UV light under air in minutes the fluorescence of the TSiMOF is turned on simultaneously with an intriguing surface transformation from superhydrophobic to hydrophilic. Thus, multifarious luminescent and hydrophilic patterns including logos, characters and Quick Response codes, etc. with good resolution are readily generated on the facilely fabricated TSiMOF film. The mechanism of this transformation is revealed by control experiments that the superficial trimethylsilyl groups suffering photochemical oxidation have been converted to hydroxyl groups.

         <title>4&#8208;Aminothiophenol Photodimerization Without Plasmons
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>

The photodimerization of 4&#8208;aminothiophenol (PATP) into 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dimercaptobenzene (DMAB) is demonstrated to occur in the absence of any plasmonic mediators, previously considered a paradigm for driving this type of photo&#8208;oxidation. An alternative pathway, based on direct activation of singlet oxygen, is demonstrated. These results provide new insights in light&#8208;driven redox processes, elucidating the role of sample morphology, light and oxygen.







Abstract
The photodimerization of 4&#8208;aminothiophenol (PATP) into 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dimercaptobenzene (DMAB) has been extensively utilized as a paradigm reaction to probe the role of surface plasmons in nanoparticle&#8208;mediated light&#8208;driven processes. Here I report the first observation of the PATP&#8208;to&#8208;DMAB photoreaction in the absence of any plasmonic mediators. The reaction was observed to occur with different kinetics either for PATP adsorbed on non&#8208;plasmonic nanoparticles (TiO2, ZnO, SiO2) or deposited as macroscopic droplets. Confocal microRaman spectroscopy enabled to investigate the reaction progress in different plasmon&#8208;free contexts, either aerobic or anaerobic, suggesting a new interpretation of the photodimerization process, based on direct laser&#8208;induced activation of singlet oxygen species. These results provide new insights in light&#8208;driven redox processes, elucidating the role of sample morphology, light and oxygen.

         <title>Photocaging of Activity&#8208;Based Ubiquitin Probes via a C&#8208;Terminal Backbone Modification Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocaged cell&#8208;permeable Ub&#8208;PA and diUb&#8208;Dha probes that can be activated on demand to label DUBs in vivo have been developed using a C&#8208;terminal backbone modification strategy. These new Ub&#8208;ABPs are temporally blocked and activated through installing a light&#8208;sensitive group (e.g. nitrobenzyl) at the backbone amide bond of the Ub Gly75 residue.







Abstract
Photocaged, activity&#8208;based ubiquitin (Ub) probes (Ub&#8208;ABPs) have been developed for the time&#8208;resolved probing of deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) activities, but many Ub&#8208;ABPs are still challenging to photocage because their warheads (e.g. propargylamide (PA) or dehydroalanine (Dha)) are difficult to temporally block and activate. Here, we describe a new C&#8208;terminal backbone modification strategy for the construction of photocaged Ub&#8208;ABPs in which a light&#8208;sensitive group is placed at the backbone amide bond of the Ub Gly75. This strategy enabled the facile generation of cell&#8208;permeable photocaged Ub&#8208;PA and Dha probes that could be activated to capture DUBs after photo&#8208;irradiation, and were used to profile DUBs in cells under specially designed conditions (e.g. in cells experiencing oxidative stress) or DUBs with isopeptide linkage selectivity. This backbone modification strategy is anticipated to provide a general solution for the development of photocaged Ub ABPs bearing any warheads for DUB profiling.

Using a Ru(bpy)3Cl2 photocatalyst a rapid trans to cis isomerization for a range of pharmacological agents based&#8208;on an alkene core is achieved. These include combretastatin A&#8208;4 (CA&#8208;4), a clinical candidate in oncology, and resveratrol derivatives, allowing their selective in cellulo activation. This provides a new platform for the rapid in situ activation of unmodified pharmacological agents.







Abstract
A Ru(bpy)3Cl2 photocatalyst is applied to the rapid trans to cis isomerization of a range of alkene&#8208;containing pharmacological agents, including combretastatin A&#8208;4 (CA&#8208;4), a clinical candidate in oncology, and resveratrol derivatives, switching their configuration from inactive substances to potent cytotoxic agents. Selective in cellulo activation of the CA&#8208;4 analog Res&#8208;3M is demonstrated, along with its potent cytotoxicity and inhibition of microtubule dynamics.

         <title>Enhanced Structural Stability and Pressure&#8208;Induced Photoconductivity in Two&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Perovskite (C6H5CH2NH3)2CuBr4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enhanced structural stability and pressure&#8208;induced photoconductivity in two&#8208;dimensional Cu&#8722;Br perovskites by inserting organic C6H5CH2NH3 groups between layers is reported. No obvious volume collapse and amorphization of the perovskite&#8208;like structure is observed under compression up to 30&#8197;GPa. The pressure&#8208;induced photoconductivity behavior ranging from 10 to 40&#8197;GPa enables the further development for photovoltaic devices under extreme conditions.







Abstract
The eco&#8208;friendly properties enable two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Cu&#8208;based perovskites as ideal candidates for next&#8208;generation optoelectronics, but practical application is limited by low photoelectric conversion efficiency because of poor carrier transport abilities. Here, we report enhanced structural stability of 2D CuBr4 perovskites under compression up to 30&#8197;GPa, without obvious volume collapse or structural amorphization, by inserting organic C6H5CH2NH3 (PMA) groups between layers. The band gap value of (PMA)2CuBr4 can be effectively tuned from 1.8 to 1.47&#8197;eV by employing external pressures, leading to a broadened absorption range of 400&#8211;800&#8197;nm. Notably, we successfully detected photoconductivity of the photoresponse at pressures from 10 to 40&#8197;GPa; the maximum value of 5&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 is observed at 28&#8197;GPa, indicating potential applications for high performance photovoltaic candidates under extreme conditions.

         <title>Free Metallophosphines: Extremely Electron&#8208;Rich Phosphorus Superbases That Are Electronically and Sterically Tunable
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>

An intriguing class of free Au&#8208;substituted phosphines (AuPhos) featuring an electronically and sterically tunable, extremely electron&#8208;rich phosphorus center has been described. These AuPhos are potent synthons for multi&#8208;nuclear transition metal complexes and have tremendous potential for transition metal catalysis.







Abstract
We report herein a facile and highly modular access to an intriguing class of free Au&#8208;substituted phosphines (AuPhos), namely (LAu)nPR3&#8722;n (L=singlet carbene ligand; R=H, aryl, alkyl, silyl) (n=1&#8211;3). The Tolman electronic parameter (TEP) values coupled with theoretical investigations showcase that Au&#8208;substitution can boost the electron&#8208;releasing ability of AuPhos, thus leading to an electronically and sterically tunable, extremely electron&#8208;rich phosphorus center. The high basicity of AuPhos is attributed to the d&#8208;p lone pair &#960;&#8208;repulsion arising from interaction between Au substituents and the lone pair at P. A series of multi&#8208;nuclear transition metal complexes (i.e. Rh, Ir, Pd, Au, W, Mn) ligated by AuPhos are readily prepared via a straightforward process. Preliminary catalytic results reveal the facilitation of Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N coupling reactions and Ir&#8208;catalyzed decarbonylation reactions via AuPhos. This work provides insights for future development of electron&#8208;rich ligands.

         <title>Modulating the Electronic Metal&#8208;Support Interactions in Single&#8208;Atom Pt1&#8722;CuO Catalyst for Boosting Acetone Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulation of the electronic metal&#8208;support interactions (EMSI) of a single&#8208;atom Pt1&#8722;CuO catalyst promotes charge redistribution and electron back donation through unified Pt&#8722;O&#8722;Cu coordination bonds. Abundant positively charged Pt species and activated lattice oxygen atoms significantly enhance the catalytic performance of the material in acetone oxidation.







Abstract
The development of highly active single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) and identifying their intrinsic active sites in oxidizing industrial hazardous hydrocarbons are challenging prospects. Tuning the electronic metal&#8208;support interactions (EMSIs) is valid for modulating the catalytic performance of SACs. We propose that the modulation of the EMSIs in a Pt1&#8722;CuO SAC significantly promotes the activity of the catalyst in acetone oxidation. The EMSIs promote charge redistribution through the unified Pt&#8722;O&#8722;Cu moieties, which modulates the d&#8208;band structure of atomic Pt sites, and strengthens the adsorption and activation of reactants. The positively charged Pt atoms are superior for activating acetone at low temperatures, and the stretched Cu&#8722;O bonds facilitate the activation of lattice oxygen atoms to participate in subsequent oxidation. We believe that this work will guide researchers to engineer efficient SACs for application in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions.

         <title>Partial Metalation of Porphyrin Moieties in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks Provides Enhanced CO2 Photoreduction Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic catalyst for efficient overall CO2 photoreduction was developed through self&#8208;assembling porphyrins into a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework. The combination of more photosensitizers than redox centers in the structure allows for not only the adequate photon input and efficient use of photogenerated charge, but noticeable changes to the microenvironment surrounding active sites.







Abstract
In natural photosynthesis, the architecture of multiproteins integrates more chromophores than redox centers and simultaneously creates a well&#8208;controlled environment around the active site. Herein, we demonstrate that these features can be emulated in a prototype hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) through simply varying the proportion of metalated porphyrin in the structure. Further studies demonstrate that changing the metalloporphyrin content not only realizes a fine tuning of the photosensitizer/catalyst ratio, but also alters the microenvironment surrounding the active site and the charge separation efficiency. As a result, the obtained material achieves the challenging overall CO2 reduction with a high HCOOH production rate (29.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, scavenger free), standing out from existing competitors. This work unveils that the degree of metalation is vital to the catalytic activity of the porphryinic framework, presenting as a new strategy to optimize the performance of heterogeneous catalysts.

         <title>Hydroxylated Multi&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes Covalently Modified with Tris(hydroxypropyl) Phosphine as a Functional Interlayer for Advanced Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
The organic small molecule tris(hydroxypropyl) phosphine (THPP) grafted on hydroxylated multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (CNT&#8208;OH) as intercalation of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs) has been demonstrated to accelerate the catalytic conversion, effectively restrain the shuttle effect of polysulfides and reduce the formation of lithium dendrites.







Abstract
We have successfully constructed a new type of intercalation membrane material by covalently grafting organic tris(hydroxypropyl)phosphine (THPP) molecules onto hydroxylated multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (CNT&#8208;OH) as a functional interlayer for the advanced LSBs. The as&#8208;assembled interlayer has been demonstrated to be responsible for the fast conversion kinetics of polysulfides, the inhibition of polysulfide shuttle effect, as well as the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase(SEI) layer. By means of spectroscopic and electrochemical analysis, we further found THPP plays a key role in accelerating the conversion of polysulfides into low&#8208;ordered lithium sulfides and suppressing the loss of polysulfides, thus rendering the as&#8208;designed lithium&#8211;sulfur battery in this work a high capacity, excellent rate performance and long&#8208;term stability. Even at low temperatures, the capacity decay rate was only 0.036&#8201;% per cycle for 1700&#8197;cycles.

A catalyst&#8208;dependent [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of sulfoxide&#8208;ynamides enables the divergent and atom&#8208;economic synthesis of a series of valuable medium&#8208;sized N,S&#8208;heterocycles in moderate to good yields with broad substrate scope. Excellent enantioselectivities were achieved with this chirality&#8208;transfer strategy, which was studied by theoretical calculations.







Abstract
Medium&#8208;sized N,S&#8208;heterocycles have received tremendous interest due to their biological activities and potential medical applications. However, asymmetric synthesis of these compounds are extremely rare. Described herein is a catalyst&#8208;dependent [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of sulfoxide&#8208;ynamides, enabling divergent and atom&#8208;economic synthesis of a series of valuable medium&#8208;sized N,S&#8208;heterocycles in moderate to good yields with broad substrate scope. Importantly, excellent enantioselectivities have been achieved via an unprecedented chirality&#8208;transfer. Moreover, theoretical calculations are employed to elucidate the origins of the catalyst&#8208;dependent stereospecific [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement.

Excellent enantioselectivities were achieved with this chirality-transfer strategy, which was studied by theoretical calculations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medium-sized &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-heterocycles have received tremendous interest due to their biological activities and potential medical applications. However, asymmetric synthesis of these compounds are extremely rare. Described herein is a catalyst-dependent [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of sulfoxide-ynamides, enabling divergent and atom-economic synthesis of a series of valuable medium-sized &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-heterocycles in moderate to good yields with broad substrate scope. Importantly, excellent enantioselectivities have been achieved via an unprecedented chirality-transfer. Moreover, theoretical calculations are employed to elucidate the origins of the catalyst-dependent stereospecific [3,3]-rearrangement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Meinwald Rearrangement with an Unusual Regioselective and Stereospecific 1,2&#8208;Methyl Shift</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly regioselective and stereospecific enzyme&#8208;catalyzed Meinwald rearrangement of internal and cyclic epoxides through a 1,2&#8208;methyl shift gave aldehydes or ketones as the sole product with enantio&#8208;retention. The unique isomerization was incorporated into enantioselective cascades, providing novel access to chiral alcohols, acids and amines from readily available trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;methylstyrenes.







Abstract
The Meinwald rearrangement is a synthetically useful reaction but often lacks regioselectivity and stereocontrol. A significant challenge in the Meinwald rearrangement of internal epoxides is the non&#8208;regioselective migration of different substituents to give a mixture of products. Herein, an enzyme&#8208;catalyzed regioselective and stereospecific 1,2&#8208;methyl shift in the Meinwald rearrangement of internal epoxides is reported. Styrene oxide isomerase (SOI) catalyzed the unique isomerization of internal epoxides through 1,2&#8208;methyl shift without 1,2&#8208;hydride shift to give the corresponding aldehydes and a cyclic ketone as the sole product. SOI&#8208;catalyzed isomerization showed high stereospecificity, fully retaining the stereoconfiguration. The synthetic utility of this enzymatic Meinwald rearrangement was demonstrated by its incorporation into three new types of enantioselective cascades, to convert trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;methyl styrenes into the corresponding R&#8208;configured alcohols, acids, or amines in high ee and yield.

         <title>Harnessing Natural Products by a Pharmacophore&#8208;Oriented Semisynthesis Approach for the Discovery of Potential Anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pharmacophore&#8208;oriented semisynthesis (POSS) approach was applied to (&#8722;)&#8208;maoelactone&#8197;A (1) and oridonin (2) for the discovery of anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 agents. A Wolff rearrangement/lactonization cascade (WRLC) was developed to install the unprecedented scaffold during semisynthesis of 1. Further assembly of the pharmacophore of 1 and scaffold of 2 by WRLC reaction led to the discovery of a potential anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 agent with EC50 at 19&#8197;nM.







Abstract
Natural products possessing unique scaffolds may have antiviral activity but their complex structures hinder facile synthesis. A pharmacophore&#8208;oriented semisynthesis approach was applied to (&#8722;)&#8208;maoelactone&#8197;A (1) and oridonin (2) for the discovery of anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 agents. The Wolff rearrangement/lactonization cascade (WRLC) reaction was developed to construct the unprecedented maoelactone&#8208;type scaffold during semisynthesis of 1. Further mechanistic study suggested a concerted mechanism for Wolff rearrangement and a water&#8208;assisted stepwise process for lactonization. The WRLC reaction then enabled the creation of a novel family by assembly of the maoelactone&#8208;type scaffold and the pharmacophore of 2, whereby one derivative inhibited SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 replication in HPA EpiC cells with a low EC50 value (19&#177;1&#8197;nM) and a high TI value (&gt;1000), both values better than those of remdesivir.

         <title>A Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Small&#8208;Molecule Metal&#8208;Carrying Prochelator: A Novel Prodrug Design Strategy for Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stimulus&#8208;responsive small&#8208;molecule metal&#8208;carrying prochelator was developed as a novel strategy for the prodrug design of metal complexes. The metal&#8208;carrying prochelator can co&#8208;carry a metal ion and chelator within a single small&#8208;molecule compound and remain inert until it undergoes a specifically triggered intramolecular chelation reaction for the in situ synthesis of a bioactive metal complex for targeted therapy.







Abstract
Selective activation of prodrugs is an important approach to reduce the side effects of disease treatment. We report a prodrug design concept for metal complexes, termed &#8220;metal&#8208;carrying prochelator&#8221;, which can co&#8208;carry a metal ion and chelator within a single small&#8208;molecule compound and remain inert until it undergoes a specifically triggered intramolecular chelation to synthesize a bioactive metal complex in situ for targeted therapy. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we designed a H2O2&#8208;responsive small&#8208;molecule prochelator, DPBD, based on the strong chelator diethyldithiocarbamate (DTC) and copper. DPBD can carry Cu2+ (DPBD&#8208;Cu) and respond to elevated H2O2 levels in tumor cells by releasing DTC, which rapidly chelates Cu2+ from DPBD&#8208;Cu affording a DTC&#8211;copper complex with high cytotoxicity, realizing potent antitumor efficacy with low systemic toxicity. Thus, with its unique intramolecularly triggered activation mechanism, this concept based on a small&#8208;molecule metal&#8208;carrying prochelator can help in the prodrug design of metal complexes.

         <title>A Fluorescent Cage for Supramolecular Sensing of 3&#8208;Nitrotyrosine in Human Blood Serum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescence by rotational restriction of two tetraphenylethenes (TPE) in a covalent cage is selectively quenched in human blood serum by 3&#8208;nitrotyrosine, a key biomarker of kidney injury. This cage, with a limit of detection under physiologically relevant concentrations, is the first reported fluorescent supramolecular sensor for such a relevant compound.







Abstract
3&#8208;Nitrotyrosine (NT) is generated by the action of peroxynitrite and other reactive nitrogen species (RNS), and as a consequence it is accumulated in inflammation&#8208;associated conditions. This is particularly relevant in kidney disease, where NT concentration in blood is considerably high. Therefore, NT is a crucial biomarker of renal damage, although it has been underestimated in clinical diagnosis due to the lack of an appropriate sensing method. Herein we report the first fluorescent supramolecular sensor for such a relevant compound: Fluorescence by rotational restriction of tetraphenylethenes (TPE) in a covalent cage is selectively quenched in human blood serum by 3&#8208;nitrotyrosine (NT) that binds to the cage with high affinity, allowing a limit of detection within the reported physiological concentrations of NT in chronic kidney disease.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework (HOF)&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Neural Stem Cell Encapsulation and Transplantation to Remodel Impaired Neural Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoencapsulation of neural stem cells (NSCs) in a biocompatible hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) composite is presented here to improve the therapeutic efficacy of NSC transplantation. Additionally, porous carbon nanosphere nanozymes (PCNs) are doped into the HOF shells to endow the cellular exoskeletons with hierarchical hydrogen bonds, NIR&#8208;II triggered degradation, and antioxidant activity. Implementing this strategy in a mouse model was shown to ameliorate pathological symptoms related to Alzheimer's disease.







Abstract
Herein we present a new way to encapsulate neural stem cells (NSCs) by using hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) to overcome the common causes of low therapeutic efficacy during NSC transplantation: 1)&#8197;loss of fundamental stem cell properties, &#8220;stemness&#8221;, before transplantation, 2)&#8197;cytomembrane damage during transplantation, and 3)&#8197;apoptosis due to oxidative stress after transplantation. Porous carbon nanospheres (PCNs) are doped into the HOF shell during the process of mineralization to endow the cellular exoskeletons with hierarchical hydrogen bonds, and the ability to resist oxidative stress due to the catalase and superoxide dismutase&#8208;like activities of PCN. Under NIR&#8208;II irradiation, thermal&#8208;responsive hydrogen bonds dissociate to release NSCs. Stereotactic transplanting encapsulated NSC into the brain of an Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model further verifies that our design can enhance NSC viability, promote neurogenesis, and ameliorate cognitive impairment. As the first example of using HOFs to encapsulate NSCs, this work may inspire the design of HOF&#8208;based exoskeletons to ameliorate neurogenesis and cognitive behavioral symptoms associated with AD.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free C&#8722;H Functionalization via Diaryliodonium Salts with a Chemically Robust Dummy Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step C&#8722;H functionalization applicable to both electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient arenes is described. The method does not require a transition&#8208;metal catalyst and allows rapid structural diversification through the incorporation of various functionalities into complex molecules.







Abstract
A two&#8208;step strategy for the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free C&#8722;H functionalization of arenes using unsymmetrical iodonium salts as versatile synthetic linchpins is presented. The key to the success of this strategy is the identification of the 3,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;isoxazolyl (DMIX) group as a superior dummy ligand, which enables not only site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H functionalization to afford unsymmetrical iodonium salts, but also highly selective aryl transfer during the subsequent metal&#8208;free coupling reaction. Both electron&#8208;rich and moderately electron&#8208;deficient arenes can be converted into the iodonium salts through C&#8722;H functionalization, allowing for diverse structural elaboration by metal&#8208;free C&#8722;N, C&#8722;C, C&#8722;S, and C&#8722;O coupling.

         <title>Towards Control and Oversight of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Diagnosis and Monitoring through Multiplexed Quantitative Electroanalytical Immune Response Biosensors</title>

A multiplexed amperometric bioplatform can detect and quantify total and isotype N&#8208; and S&#8208;specific anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 serum immunoglobulins within 75&#8197;minutes. The platform was used to analyze the global and isotype&#8208;specific immune response of COVID&#8208;19 convalescent and vaccinated individuals, and to detect variant&#8208;specific S antibodies from variants of concern.







Abstract
The development of versatile and sensitive biotools to quantify specific SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 immunoglobulins in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infected and non&#8208;infected individuals, built on the surface of magnetic microbeads functionalized with nucleocapsid (N) and in&#8208;house expressed recombinant spike (S) proteins is reported. Amperometric interrogation of captured N&#8208; and S&#8208;specific circulating total or individual immunoglobulin (Ig) isotypes (IgG, IgM, and IgA), subsequently labelled with HRP&#8208;conjugated secondary antibodies, was performed at disposable single or multiplexed (8&#215;) screen&#8208;printed electrodes using the HQ/HRP/H2O2 system. The obtained results using N and in&#8208;house expressed S ectodomains of five SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants of concern (including the latest Delta and Omicron) allow identification of vulnerable populations from those with natural or acquired immunity, monitoring of infection, evaluation of vaccine efficiency, and even identification of the variant responsible for the infection.

         <title>In Operando Identification of In Situ Formed Metalloid Zinc&#948;+ Active Sites for Highly Efficient Electrocatalyzed Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a zinc&#8208;based electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction reaction, the Zn&#948;+ metalloid hollow sites of stable, nonstoichiometric ZnOx, derived from Zn2P2O7, were shown to be the real active site structures for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion, demonstrated by structure characterizations through operando X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analysis in conjunction with evolutionary&#8208;algorithm&#8208;based global optimization.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion provides a possible way to address problems associated with the greenhouse effect; however, developing low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts to mediate high&#8208;efficiency CO2 reduction remains a challenge on account of the limited understanding of the nature of the real active sites. Herein, we reveal the Zn&#948;+ metalloid sites as the real active sites of stable nonstoichiometric ZnOx structure derived from Zn2P2O7 through operando X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analysis in conjunction with evolutionary&#8208;algorithm&#8208;based global optimization. Furthermore, theoretical and experimental results demonstrated that Zn&#948;+ metalloid active sites could facilitate the activation of CO2 and the hydrogenation of *CO2, thus accelerating the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. Our work establishes a critical fundamental understanding of the origin of the real active center in the zinc&#8208;based electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction reaction.

         <title>Guest Alignment and Defect Formation during Pore Filling in Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guest@MOF functionalities are strongly influenced by the degree of pore filling, the orientation of the guest as well as by structural changes of the host. We report a correlative study of these host&#8211;guest interactions as a function of the pore filling using combined polarisation&#8208;dependent ATR&#8208;FTIR spectroscopy and gas sorption.







Abstract
The degree of pore filling is an important parameter for defining guest@MOF properties in applications including electronics, optics, and gas separation. However, the interplay of key aspects of host&#8211;guest interactions, such as a quantitative description of the guest alignment or the structural integrity of the host as function of pore filling are yet to be determined. Polarisation&#8208;dependent infrared spectroscopy in attenuated total reflection configuration combined with gas sorption allowed to simultaneously study the orientation of the guest molecule and structural changes of the MOF framework during the pore filling process. Thereby we found, that initially randomly oriented guest molecules align with increasing pore filling during adsorption from the gas phase. At the same time, the framework itself undergoes a reversible, guest molecule&#8208;dependent rotation of the aromatic linker and a linker detachment process, which induce defects.

We report a correlative study of these host&#8211;guest interactions as a function of the pore filling using combined polarisation-dependent ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and gas sorption.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The degree of pore filling is an important parameter for defining guest@MOF properties in applications including electronics, optics, and gas separation. However, the interplay of key aspects of host&#8211;guest interactions, such as a quantitative description of the guest alignment or the structural integrity of the host as function of pore filling are yet to be determined. Polarisation-dependent infrared spectroscopy in attenuated total reflection configuration combined with gas sorption allowed to simultaneously study the orientation of the guest molecule and structural changes of the MOF framework during the pore filling process. Thereby we found, that initially randomly oriented guest molecules align with increasing pore filling during adsorption from the gas phase. At the same time, the framework itself undergoes a reversible, guest molecule-dependent rotation of the aromatic linker and a linker detachment process, which induce defects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>carba&#8208;Nucleopeptides (cNPs): A Biopharmaceutical Modality Formed through Aqueous Rhodamine&#8197;B Photoredox Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
Exchanging the amino acid side chains of a polypeptide with C&#8722;N linked nucleobases forms oligonucleotide&#8208;like structures (aza&#8208;nucleopeptides) with favorable physicochemical properties. Connecting the nucleobase to the peptide through a C&#8722;C bond can promote new, beneficial noncovalent interactions. A general method to make C&#8722;C linked carba&#8208;nucleopeptides in batch, parallel, and flow using aqueous Rhodamine&#8197;B photoredox catalysis is reported.







Abstract
Exchanging the ribose backbone of an oligonucleotide for a peptide can enhance its physiologic stability and nucleic acid binding affinity. Ordinarily, the eneamino nitrogen atom of a nucleobase is fused to the side chain of a polypeptide through a new C&#8722;N bond. The discovery of C&#8722;C linked nucleobases in the human transcriptome reveals new opportunities for engineering nucleopeptides that replace the traditional C&#8722;N bond with a non&#8208;classical C&#8722;C bond, liberating a captive nitrogen atom and promoting new hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions. We report the first late&#8208;stage synthesis of C&#8722;C linked carba&#8208;nucleopeptides (cNPs) using aqueous Rhodamine&#8197;B photoredox catalysis. We prepare brand&#8208;new cNPs in batch, in parallel, and in flow using three long&#8208;wavelength photochemical setups. We detail the mechanism of our reaction by experimental and computational studies and highlight the essential role of diisopropylethylamine as a bifurcated two&#8208;electron reductant.

         <title>Rapid High&#8208;Contrast Photoreversible Coloration of Surface&#8208;Functionalized N&#8208;Doped TiO2 Nanocrystals for Rewritable Light&#8208;Printing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;functionalized N&#8208;doped TiO2 nanocrystals are synthesized with controllable TiIII stability, displaying reversible color switching between whitish and black upon light illumination and controlled oxidation. They can be used as a rewritable material to produce high&#8208;resolution printing and writing with excellent cyclability, promising for applications such as optical data recording, smart windows, and oxygen sensors.







Abstract
Pristine titanium dioxide (TiO2) changes color from white to black when it is reduced from TiIV to TiIII by photoexcited electrons. However, the black coloration requires substantial light energy to create, and it vanishes instantaneously upon exposure to air. This work reports the synthesis of surface&#8208;functionalized N&#8208;doped TiO2 nanocrystals that rapidly change color (i.e., within seconds) from whitish to black under low&#8208;power irradiation with excellent color stability in atmospheric conditions. The N&#8208;doping plays a critical role in promoting the surface&#8208;adsorption of polyol groups to stabilize the TiIII species and accelerate the coloration process. A rewritable paper fabricated using these nanocrystals exhibits excellent writing and erasing reversibility in response to UV irradiation and oxygen exposure. The low&#8208;cost, rapid response, excellent reversibility, and good color stability are vital advantages of N&#8208;doped TiO2 nanocrystals for color&#8208;switching applications.

         <title>PdFe Single&#8208;Atom Alloy Metallene for N2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
PdFe1 single&#8208;atom alloy metallene is demonstrated as an effective and robust catalyst for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), delivering an NH3 yield of 111.9&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 37.8&#8201;% at &#8722;0.2&#8197;V (RHE). Combined theoretical computations and operando XAS/Raman spectroscopy identify Pd&#8208;coordinated Fe single atoms as active centers to enable efficient N2 activation, reduced protonation energy barriers, suppressed hydrogen evolution and high electrocatalytic stability.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom alloys hold great promise for electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), while the comprehensive experimental/theoretical investigations of SAAs for the NRR are still missing. Herein, PdFe1 single&#8208;atom alloy metallene, in which the Fe single atoms are confined on a Pd metallene support, is first developed as an effective and robust NRR electrocatalyst, delivering exceptional NRR performance with an NH3 yield of 111.9&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1, a Faradaic efficiency of 37.8&#8201;% at &#8722;0.2&#8197;V (RHE), as well as a long&#8208;term stability for 100&#8197;h electrolysis. In&#8208;depth mechanistic investigations by theoretical computations and operando X&#8208;ray absorption/Raman spectroscopy indentify Pd&#8208;coordinated Fe single atoms as active centers to enable efficient N2 activation via N2&#8208;to&#8208;Fe &#963;&#8208;donation, reduced protonation energy barriers, suppressed hydrogen evolution and excellent thermodynamic stability, thus accounting for the high activity, selectivity and stability of PdFe1 for the NRR.

The photocatalyzed uphill isomerization of drugs using Ru(bpy3)2 is reported by Nicolas Winssinger et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202203390). This chemistry was shown to locally convert inactive drugs into active ones that alter the tubulin dynamics in cells (green structures in the background of the picture).

         <title>Back Cover: Partial Metalation of Porphyrin Moieties in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks Provides Enhanced CO2 Photoreduction Activity (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 28/2022)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic catalyst for CO2 photoreduction was developed through self&#8208;assembling porphyrins into a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework, as reported by Tian&#8208;Fu Liu, Rong Cao, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202203955). The combination of photosensitizers and redox centers in the structure not only allows for adequate photon input and efficient utilization of the photogenerated charge, but also changes the microenvironment surrounding the active sites.

         <title>Recent Breakthroughs in P4 Chemistry: Towards Practical, Direct Transformations into P1 Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transformation of white phosphorus directly into useful P1 products has long been an extremely challenging synthetic goal. However, in the past few years, several independent breakthroughs have shown that such reactions are achievable using a variety of different mechanistic strategies. This Minireview highlights these recent innovations, discusses their key features, and analyses their implications for the future development of this field.







Abstract
For several decades, academic researchers have been intensively studying the chemistry of white phosphorus (P4) in the hope of developing direct methods for its transformation into useful P&#8208;containing products. This would bypass the hazardous, multistep procedures currently relied on by industry. However, while academically interesting P4 activation reactions have become well established, their elaboration into useful, general synthetic procedures has remained out of reach. Very recently, however, a series of independent reports has begun to change this state of affairs. Each shows how relatively simple and practical synthetic methods can be used to access academically or industrially relevant P1 compounds from P4 directly, in &#8220;one pot&#8221; or even in a catalytic fashion. These reports mark a step change in the field of P4 chemistry, and suggest its possible transition from an area of largely academic interest to one with the promise of true synthetic relevance.

         <title>Comparative Evaluation of Light&#8208;Driven Catalysis: A Framework for Standardized Reporting of Data
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Scientific Perspective describes current challenges in determining, reporting, and comparing performance indicators in homogeneous and heterogeneous light&#8208;driven catalysis. The need for comparative data analysis in the field is highlighted, and its role in future data reporting and big&#8208;data analysis is discussed. A minimum set of experimental parameters to be reported for light&#8208;driven catalysis is proposed.







Abstract
Light&#8208;driven homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis require a complex interplay between light absorption, charge separation, charge transfer, and catalytic turnover. Optical and irradiation parameters as well as reaction engineering aspects play major roles in controlling catalytic performance. This multitude of factors makes it difficult to objectively compare light&#8208;driven catalysts and provide an unbiased performance assessment. This Scientific Perspective highlights the importance of collecting and reporting experimental data in homogeneous and heterogeneous light&#8208;driven catalysis. A critical analysis of the benefits and limitations of the commonly used experimental indicators is provided. Data collection and reporting according to FAIR principles is discussed in the context of future automated data analysis. The authors propose a minimum dataset as a basis for unified collecting and reporting of experimental data in homogeneous and heterogeneous light&#8208;driven catalysis. The community is encouraged to support the future development of this parameter list through an open online repository.

         <title>The Influence of Nanoconfinement on Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advances in nanoscale fabrication techniques have promoted the development of electrocatalysts where the electrochemical reactions occur within a nanoconfined space. This Review explores how different degrees of freedom of nanoconfinement affect the electrocatalytic activity for a range of reactions and how implementing nanoconfinement can help break linear scaling relationships.







Abstract
The use of nanoparticles and nanostructured electrodes are abundant in electrocatalysis. These nanometric systems contain elements of nanoconfinement in different degrees, depending on the geometry, which can have a much greater effect on the activity and selectivity than often considered. In this Review, we firstly identify the systems containing different degrees of nanoconfinement and how they can affect the activity and selectivity of electrocatalytic reactions. Then we follow with a fundamental understanding of how electrochemistry and electrocatalysis are affected by nanoconfinement, which is beginning to be uncovered, thanks to the development of new, atomically precise manufacturing and fabrication techniques as well as advances in theoretical modeling. The aim of this Review is to help us look beyond using nanostructuring as just a way to increase surface area, but also as a way to break the scaling relations imposed on electrocatalysis by thermodynamics.

         <title>A Silylene&#8208;Stabilized Germanium Analogue of Alkynylaluminum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silylene&#8208;stabilized germanium analogue of alkynylaluminum, namely the digermynyl aluminum complex, was synthesized and characterized, which features a linear AlGeGe skeleton with a Ge=Ge double bond and a polarized Ge&#8722;Al bond. It readily reacted with H2, CS2 and TolNCO under mild conditions to give an unprecedented germylenyl aluminum complex and germanium&#8208;containing heterocycles, highlighting its utility as a synthon for the preparation of novel aluminum and germanium compounds.







Abstract
In contrast to the well&#8208;developed metal acetylides, the heavier analogues of the type REEM (E=Si, Ge, Sn, Pb; M=metals) have not been reported to date. Herein, we describe the synthesis of a silylene&#8208;stabilized germanium analogue of alkynylaluminum (4) by the reaction of a silylene&#8208;stabilized digermavinylidene (3) with 0.25&#8197;equiv of (AlCp*)4 in THF at 80&#8201;&#176;C. The structure of 4 has been unambiguously characterized by spectroscopic analysis, X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses and DFT calculations, and features a linear AlGeGe skeleton with a Ge=Ge double bond and a polarized Ge&#8722;Al bond. Complex 4 shows excellent reactivity towards small molecules such as H2, CS2 and TolNCO, and this allows for the construction of the structurally intriguing germylenyl aluminum complex (5) and the germacycles (6, 7).

         <title>Preparation of Distant Quaternary Carbon Stereocenters by Double Selective Ring&#8208;Opening of 1,1&#8208;Biscyclopropyl Methanol Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convergent approach to the formation of polysubstituted biscyclopropyl methanol derivatives was developed as a new entry to the formation of skipped dienals possessing two distant quaternary carbon stereocenters within acyclic systems with excellent diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
The diastereoselective double carbometalation reaction of cyclopropenes provides, in a single&#8208;pot operation, two &#969;&#8208;ene&#8208;[1,1]&#8208;bicyclopropyl ester derivatives. One regioisomer then undergoes a Pd&#8208;catalyzed addition of aryl iodide to provide skipped dienes possessing several distant stereocenters including two congested quaternary carbon centers with excellent diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Unexpected White Phosphorus (P4) Activation Modes with Silylene&#8208;Substituted o&#8208;Carboranes and Access to an Isolable 1,3&#8208;Diphospha&#8208;2,4&#8208;disilabutadiene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
New metal&#8208;free white phosphorus (P4) activation modes have been observed using divalent SiII atoms bonded to a 1,2&#8208;dicarborane scaffold: while two molar equivalents of the silylene&#8208;phosphine 1 are capable of co&#8208;activating one molecule of white phosphorus, yielding the P5&#8208;chain containing species 2, the degradation of P4 using the bis(silylene) analogue 3 affords the first isolable 1,3&#8208;diphospha&#8208;2,4&#8208;disilabutadiene 4 with a Si=P&#8722;Si=P delocalized skeleton.







Abstract
New types of metal&#8208;free white phosphorus (P4) activation are reported. While the phosphine&#8208;silylene&#8208;substituted dicarborane 1, CB&#8208;SiP (CB=ortho&#8208;C,C&#8242;&#8208;C2B10H10, Si=PhC(tBuN)2Si, P=P[N(tBu)CH2]2), activates white phosphorus in a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 molar ratio to yield the P5&#8208;chain containing species 2, the analogous bis(silylene)&#8208;substituted compound 3, CB&#8208;Si2, reacts with P4 in the molar ratio of 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 to furnish the first isolable 1,3&#8208;diphospha&#8208;2,4&#8208;disilabutadiene (Si=P&#8722;Si=P&#8208;containing) compound 4. For the latter reaction, two intermediates having a CB&#8208;Si2P4 and CB&#8208;Si2P2 core could be observed by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. The compounds 2 and 4 were characterized including single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. Their electronic structures and mechanisms were investigated by density functional theory calculations.

While the phosphine-silylene-substituted dicarborane &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, CB-&lt;b&gt;SiP&lt;/b&gt; (CB=&lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-C,C&#8242;-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Si&lt;/b&gt;=PhC(tBuN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si, &lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt;=P[N(tBu)CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), activates white phosphorus in a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 molar ratio to yield the P&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-chain containing species &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, the analogous bis(silylene)-substituted compound &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, CB-&lt;b&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;,&lt;/sub&gt; reacts with P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in the molar ratio of 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 to furnish the first isolable 1,3-diphospha-2,4-disilabutadiene (Si=P&#8722;Si=P-containing) compound &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;. For the latter reaction, two intermediates having a CB-Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and CB-Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; core could be observed by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. The compounds &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; were characterized including single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. Their electronic structures and mechanisms were investigated by density functional theory calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective Click Cycloaddition of Azides and Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective click cycloaddition of azides and alkynes for rapid and modular access to atropisomeric triazoles is reported. This click process features very mild reaction conditions, superior efficiency and enantioselectivity, broad substrate scope and facile scalability. The racemization study and further derivatizations demonstrate the good configurational stability of the obtained axially chiral triazole products.







Abstract
The cycloaddition of azides and alkynes is the leading click chemistry technology and has been widely used in drug discovery, biology and material sciences. However, the development of a modular and scalable enantioselective click cycloaddition remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, we report a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective click cycloaddition of azides and alkynes for rapid and modular access to atropisomeric triazoles in excellent yields and enantioselectivities. The process is mild, efficient and scalable, and features broad substrate scope.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Mutanobactins&#8197;A, B from the Human Microbiome: Macrocyclization and Thiazepanone Assembly in a Single Step</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The human&#8208;derived lipopeptides mutanobactins&#8197;A, B and D were prepared in a rapid solid&#8208;phase approach, featuring a cascade bicyclization as the last step. Additionally, a thiazepanone amino acid building block for application in analogue synthesis was produced.







Abstract
We report the first total syntheses of tricyclic mutanobactins&#8197;A and B, lipopeptides incorporating a thiazepanone, isolated from Streptococcus mutans, a member of the human oral microbiome. A rapid, solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) based route delivers these natural products from a cascade of cyclization reactions. This versatile process was also employed in a streamlined synthesis of mutanobactin&#8197;D. Additionally, we provide an independent synthesis of a truncated mutanobactin&#8197;A analog, utilizing a novel thiazepanone amino acid building block.

         <title>Stacked Reticular Frame Boosted Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Chiral Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) was achieved in olefin&#8208;linked chiral covalent organic frameworks (COFs) via dual confinement of the covalent reticular frame and the noncovalent interlayer stacking.







Abstract
Chiral covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) are intriguing as advanced chiroptical materials but have not been reported to date. We constructed chiroptical COF materials with CPL activity through the convenient Knoevenagel condensation of formyl&#8208;functionalized axially chiral linkers and C3&#8208;symmetric 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetriacetonitrile. Remarkably, the as&#8208;prepared chiral COFs showed high absorption and luminescent dissymmetric factors up to 0.02 (gabs) and 0.04 (glum), respectively. In contrast, the branched chiral polymers from the same starting monomers were CPL silent. Structural and spectral characterization revealed that the reticular frame was indispensable for CPL generation via confined chirality transfer. Moreover, reticular stacking boosted the CPL performance significantly due to the interlayer restriction of frame. This work demonstrates the first example of a CPL&#8208;active COF and provides insight into CPL generation through covalent reticular chemistry, which will play a constructive role in the future design of high&#8208;performance CPL materials.

         <title>Tunable CHA/AEI Zeolite Intergrowths with A Priori Biselective Organic Structure&#8208;Directing Agents: Controlling Enrichment and Implications for Selective Catalytic Reduction of NOx</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled CHA/AEI zeolite intergrowth materials were prepared with ab&#8208;initio&#8208;selected biselective organic structure&#8208;directing agents (OSDAs), which were gleaned from high&#8208;throughput simulation analysis of OSDA&#8208;zeolite interactions. Efficient selective catalytic reduction of NOx was performed with the resulting materials. This method guides the preparation of zeolite intergrowths toward more complex structures with unique catalytic properties.







Abstract
A novel ab initio methodology based on high&#8208;throughput simulations has permitted designing unique biselective organic structure&#8208;directing agents (OSDAs) that allow the efficient synthesis of CHA/AEI zeolite intergrowth materials with controlled phase compositions. Distinctive local crystallographic ordering of the CHA/AEI intergrowths was revealed at the nanoscale level using integrated differential phase contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC STEM). These novel CHA/AEI materials have been tested for the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx, presenting an outstanding catalytic performance and hydrothermal stability, even surpassing the performance of the well&#8208;established commercial CHA&#8208;type catalyst. This methodology opens the possibility for synthetizing new zeolite intergrowths with more complex structures and unique catalytic properties.

         <title>Traceless Benzylic C&#8722;H Amination via Bifunctional N&#8208;Aminopyridinium Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
C&#8722;H amination chemistry via traceless bifunctional nitrogen activation is reported. Sequential C&#8722;H aminopyridylation followed by Ni&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling with aryl boronic acids affords the products of aryl nitrene insertion into C&#8722;H bonds. These products are unavailable by direct nitrene insertion due to the intrinsic instability of aryl nitrenes. The described method can be applied in the context of pharmacologically active molecules.







Abstract
C&#8722;H amination reactions provide the opportunity to streamline the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;containing organic small molecules. The impact of intermolecular C&#8722;H amination methods, however, is currently limited the frequent requirement for the amine precursors to bear activating groups, such as N&#8208;sulfonyl substituents, that are both challenging to remove and not useful synthetic handles for subsequent derivatization. Here, we introduce traceless nitrogen activation for C&#8722;H amination&#8212;which enables application of selective C&#8722;H amination chemistry to the preparation of diverse N&#8208;functionalized products&#8212;via sequential benzylic C&#8722;H N&#8208;aminopyridylation followed by Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling with aryl boronic acids. Unlike many C&#8722;H amination reactions that provide access to protected amines, the current method installs an easily diversifiable synthetic handle that serves as a lynchpin for C&#8722;H amination, deaminative N&#8722;N functionalization sequences.

Sequential C&#8722;H aminopyridylation followed by Ni-catalyzed cross-coupling with aryl boronic acids affords the products of aryl nitrene insertion into C&#8722;H bonds. These products are unavailable by direct nitrene insertion due to the intrinsic instability of aryl nitrenes. The described method can be applied in the context of pharmacologically active molecules.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C&#8722;H amination reactions provide the opportunity to streamline the synthesis of nitrogen-containing organic small molecules. The impact of intermolecular C&#8722;H amination methods, however, is currently limited the frequent requirement for the amine precursors to bear activating groups, such as &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-sulfonyl substituents, that are both challenging to remove and not useful synthetic handles for subsequent derivatization. Here, we introduce traceless nitrogen activation for C&#8722;H amination&#8212;which enables application of selective C&#8722;H amination chemistry to the preparation of diverse &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-functionalized products&#8212;via sequential benzylic C&#8722;H &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-aminopyridylation followed by Ni-catalyzed C&#8722;N cross-coupling with aryl boronic acids. Unlike many C&#8722;H amination reactions that provide access to protected amines, the current method installs an easily diversifiable synthetic handle that serves as a lynchpin for C&#8722;H amination, deaminative N&#8722;N functionalization sequences.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Tris(pentafluorophenyl)methylium Cation: Isolation and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two brave knights worrying for their hydrides and electrons are caught in the storm of a small tritylium and a giant perfluorotritylium windmill. Herein, the structural proof of the perfluorinated trityl cation and its remarkable hydride ion affinity and oxidation potential compared to its non&#8208;fluorinated analogue are reported.







Abstract
Herein, we present two different routes for the synthesis of the perfluorinated trityl cation, which allowed the handling of the free, uncoordinated species in organic solvents for the first time. The usage of the weakly coordinating anion [Al(OTeF5)4]&#8722; and its derivatives allows the characterization of this species by NMR spectroscopy and most importantly by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The high hydride ion affinity of the cation is shown by hydrogen abstraction from isobutane. Furthermore, cyclic voltammetry reveals its oxidative potential which is supported by the reaction with tris(4&#8208;bromophenyl)amine, giving rise to the formation of the ammoniumyl radical cation, also known as &#8220;magic blue&#8221;.

         <title>Catalytic Decomposition of Long&#8208;Chain Olefins to Propylene via Isomerization&#8208;Metathesis Using Latent Bicyclic (Alkyl)(Amino)Carbene&#8208;Ruthenium Olefin Metathesis Catalysts</title>

         <dc:description>
Bicyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene ruthenium temperature&#8208;activated, thermally stable olefin metathesis (ethenolysis) catalysts are reported for the catalytic decomposition of long&#8208;chain olefins such as 1&#8208;octadecene or methyl oleate into propylene. The reaction occurs via isomerization&#8208;metathesis using the (RuHCl)(CO)(PPh3)3 isomerization co&#8208;catalyst.







Abstract
One of the most exciting scientific challenges today is the catalytic degradation of non&#8208;biodegradable polymers into value&#8208;added chemical feedstocks. The mild pyrolysis of polyolefins, including high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE), results in pyrolysis oils containing long&#8208;chain olefins as major products. In this paper, novel bicyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene ruthenium (BICAAC&#8722;Ru) temperature&#8208;activated latent olefin metathesis catalysts, which can be used for catalytic decomposition of long&#8208;chain olefins to propylene are reported. These thermally stable catalysts show significantly higher selectivity to propylene at a reaction temperature of 75&#8201;&#176;C compared to second generation Hoveyda&#8211;Grubbs or CAAC&#8722;Ru catalysts under ethenolysis conditions. The conversion of long&#8208;chain olefins (e.g., 1&#8208;octadecene or methyl oleate) to propylene via isomerization&#8208;metathesis is performed by using a (RuHCl)(CO)(PPh3)3 isomerization co&#8208;catalyst. The reactions can be carried out at a BICAAC&#8722;Ru catalyst loading as low as 1&#8197;ppm at elevated reaction temperature (75&#8201;&#176;C). The observed turnover number and turnover frequency are as high as 55&#8201;000 and 10&#8201;000&#8197;molpropylene&#8201;molcatalyst&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, respectively.

         <title>SrZnGeS4: A Dual&#8208;Waveband Nonlinear Optical Material with a Transparency Spanning UV/Vis and Far&#8208;IR Spectral Regions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electronic structure&#8208;engineering &#8220;bucket effect&#8221; strategy produces a novel non&#8208;linear optical compound SrZnGeS4 with unique dual&#8208;waveband NLO properties, including a second harmonic generation of 0.9&#8211;17.5&#215;AgGaS2 under 850&#8211;2100&#8197;nm incident laser wavelengths and a laser&#8208;induced damage threshold of 35&#215;AgGaS2.







Abstract
Non&#8208;linear optical chalcogenides with a wide band gap (Eg) and excellent NLO properties are key materials for highly desirable multiwaveband tunable optical parametric oscillators (OPOs). We exploit the &#8220;electronic structure engineer bucket effect&#8221; to develop a novel dual&#8208;waveband SrZnGeS4 with an ultrawide transparency window. It exhibits an asymmetric Fdd2 structure that consists of layers formed by corner&#8208;sharing [ZnGeS6] dimers. SrZnGeS4 is transparent from 0.30 to 23.6&#8197;&#956;m, spanning the UV&#8208;, vis&#8208;, mid&#8208; and far&#8208;IR spectral regions and has the widest Eg (3.63&#8197;eV) in the AeMIIMIVQ4 family to date. It exhibits phase matching, high SHG intensities (e.g., 11.0&#215;KDP and 17.5&#215;AGS under &#955;inc=1450 and 950&#8197;nm, respectively), and a very high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (35&#215;AGS). These results not only suggest bright prospects for high&#8208;power laser applications but may also enable applications of the multiwaveband OPO system from the UV&#8208;visible to far&#8208;IR regions.

         <title>Cobalt(III)/Chiral Carboxylic Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Synthesis of Benzothiadiazine&#8208;1&#8208;oxides via C&#8722;H Activation</title>

         <dc:description>
Enantioselective synthesis of benzothiadiazine&#8208;1&#8208;oxides has been achieved using an achiral cobalt(III) catalyst and a pseudo&#8208;C2&#8208;symmetric H8&#8208;binaphthyl chiral carboxylic acid. The hybrid catalytic system enables a rapid access to benzothiadiazine&#8208;1&#8208;oxides from readily available sulfoximines and dioxazolones with high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Among sulfoximine derivatives containing a chiral sulfur center, benzothiadiazine&#8208;1&#8208;oxides are important for applications in medicinal chemistry. Here, we report that the combination of an achiral cobalt(III) catalyst and a pseudo&#8208;C2&#8208;symmetric H8&#8208;binaphthyl chiral carboxylic acid enables the asymmetric synthesis of benzothiadiazine&#8208;1&#8208;oxides from sulfoximines and dioxazolones via enantioselective C&#8722;H bond cleavage. With the optimized protocol, benzothiadiazine&#8208;1&#8208;oxides with several functional groups can be accessed with high enantioselectivity.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of a Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Graphene Nanoribbon with Multiple Substitutional Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
N=9 nitrogen&#8208;doped armchair graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) (N&#8208;9&#8208;AGNRs) with multiple substitutional sites were synthesized. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the doped sites of N atoms play a significant role in modulating the electronic structures of N&#8208;9&#8208;AGNRs (semiconducting for (C&#8722;C), metallic for (C&#8722;N) and (N&#8722;N)).







Abstract
Doped graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with heteroatoms are a principal strategy to fine&#8208;tune the electronic structures of GNRs for future device applications. Here, we successfully synthesized the N=9 nitrogen&#8208;doped armchair GNR on the Au(111) surface. Due to the flexibility of precursor molecules, three different covalent bonds (C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, N&#8722;N) are formed in the GNR backbone. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy analysis together with band structure calculations reveals that the band gap of the N&#8208;9&#8208;AGNRs (C&#8722;C) will be enlarged compared to pristine 9&#8208;AGNRs, and the C&#8722;N bond and N&#8722;N bond at the isolated site of N&#8208;9&#8208;AGNR (C&#8722;C) will introduce new defect states near the Fermi level. DFT calculations reveal that the electronic structure of N&#8208;9&#8208;AGNR (C&#8722;C) shows semiconductor character, while N&#8208;9&#8208;AGNR (C&#8722;N) and N&#8208;9&#8208;AGNR (N&#8722;N) display metallic character. Our results provide a promising route for creating more complex molecular heterostructures with tunable band gaps, which may be useful for future molecular electronics and memory device applications.

         <title>Tetracoordinate Boron&#8208;Based Multifunctional Chiral Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters simultaneously showing aggregation&#8208;induced emission, circularly polarized luminescence, mechanochromism, and piezochromism behaviors have been developed. Moreover, a highly efficient solution&#8208;processed nondoped near&#8208;infrared organic light&#8208;emitting diode peaking at 716&#8197;nm was demonstrated with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 1.9&#8201;%, and a record&#8208;high exciton utilization efficiency of 86&#8201;%.







Abstract
Purely organic emitters have shown great potential but still suffer from low efficiency in near&#8208;infrared organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (NIR&#8208;OLEDs) due to the intensive non&#8208;radiative recombination. In this contribution, two pairs of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) enantiomers (R/S&#8208;DOBP and R/S&#8208;HDOBP) with tetracoordinate boron geometries were designed and synthesized. The TADF emitters simultaneously showed aggregation&#8208;induced emission, circularly polarized luminescence, high&#8208;contrast mechanochromism, and piezochromism behaviors. More importantly, R/S&#8208;DOBP and R/S&#8208;HDOBP revealed high photoluminescence quantum yields and efficient reverse intersystem crossing in neat films. The nondoped solution&#8208;processed OLEDs based on these unique emitters revealed the NIR emission (peaking at 716&#8197;nm) with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 1.9&#8201;% and high exciton utilization efficiency of 86&#8201;%, which represent one of the best solution&#8208;processed nondoped NIR&#8208;OLEDs.

         <title>Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Bastimolide&#8197;A: A Showcase for Type I Anion Relay Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of remote stereochemistry via successive Type I Anion Relay Chemistry (ARC) coupling of commercially available enantioenriched epoxides has enabled a 20&#8208;step total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;bastimolide&#8197;A. The streamlined assembly and manipulation of ARC products demonstrates a versatile approach that could be leveraged toward other polyhydroxylated macrolides







Abstract
A highly convergent total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;bastimolide&#8197;A (1), a polyhydroxy antimalarial macrolide, has been achieved via a longest linear sequence of twenty steps from commercially available glycidyl ethers. Type I Anion Relay Chemistry (ARC) coupling tactics enable rapid construction of the molecule's 1,5&#8208;polylol backbone. A late&#8208;stage B&#8208;alkyl Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura union and an Evans&#8208;modified Mukaiyama macrolactonization generate the forty&#8208;membered Z&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated macrocyclic lactone.

         <title>Unimolecular Nanoparticles toward More Precise Regulations of Self&#8208;Assembled Superlattices in Soft Matter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the precisely synthesized giant molecule &#946;CD&#8208;O21 the concept of soft unimolecular nanoparticles (UMNPs) has been realized. Upon self&#8208;assembly or assembly with other giant molecules, &#946;CD&#8208;O21 directly participates in superlattice formation, giving rise to various complex superlattices with fast dynamics and enhanced ordering.







Abstract
The hierarchical self&#8208;assembly process opens up great potential for the construction of nanostructural superlattices. Precise regulation of self&#8208;assembled superlattices, however, remains a challenge. Even when the primary molecules are precise, the supramolecular motifs (or secondary building blocks) can vary dramatically. In the present work, we propose the concept of unimolecular nanoparticles (UMNPs). The UMNPs act as the supramolecular motif and directly pack into the superlattices. A highly branched giant molecule is presented. We systematically explore its conformations and the superlattice of this giant molecule. Moreover, intriguing complex phases are discovered when blending this UMNP with other conventional giant molecules. These binary mixtures provide direct evidence to support our previously proposed self&#8208;sorting process in the self&#8208;assembly of &#8220;soft alloys&#8221;. The concept of UMNPs offers a unique approach toward more precise regulation of self&#8208;assembled superlattices in soft matter.

         <title>Site&#8208;Sensitive Selective CO2 Photoreduction to CO over Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermodynamic bottleneck of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion is unlocked by the incorporation of twinning planes into normal fcc&#8208;phase Au NPs. A forty&#8208;fold improvement in photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity is achieved, with near perfect CO selectivity.







Abstract
We demonstrate a new case of materials&#8211;gene engineering to precisely design photocatalysts with the prescribed properties. Based on theoretical calculations, a phase&#8208;doping strategy was proposed to regulate the pathways of CO2 conversion over Au nanoparticles (NPs) loaded TiO2 photocatalysts. As a result, the thermodynamic bottleneck of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion is successfully unlocked by the incorporation of stable twinning crystal planes into face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) phase Au NPs. Compared to bare pristine TiO2, the activity results showed that the loading of regular fcc&#8208;Au NPs raised the CO production by 18&#8208;fold but suppressed the selectivity from 84&#8201;% to 75&#8201;%, whereas Au NPs with twinning (110) and (100) facets boosted the activity by nearly 40&#8208;fold and established near unity CO selectivity. This enhancement is shown to originate from a beneficial shift in the surface reactive site energetics arising at the twinned stacking fault, whereby both the CO reaction energy and desorption energy were significantly reduced.

&lt;p&gt;The thermodynamic bottleneck of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-CO conversion is unlocked by the incorporation of twinning planes into normal &lt;i&gt;fcc&lt;/i&gt;-phase Au NPs. A forty-fold improvement in photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction activity is achieved, with near perfect CO selectivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate a new case of materials&#8211;gene engineering to precisely design photocatalysts with the prescribed properties. Based on theoretical calculations, a phase-doping strategy was proposed to regulate the pathways of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion over Au nanoparticles (NPs) loaded TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photocatalysts. As a result, the thermodynamic bottleneck of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-CO conversion is successfully unlocked by the incorporation of stable twinning crystal planes into face-centered cubic (&lt;i&gt;fcc&lt;/i&gt;) phase Au NPs. Compared to bare pristine TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the activity results showed that the loading of regular &lt;i&gt;fcc&lt;/i&gt;-Au NPs raised the CO production by 18-fold but suppressed the selectivity from 84&#8201;% to 75&#8201;%, whereas Au NPs with twinning (110) and (100) facets boosted the activity by nearly 40-fold and established near unity CO selectivity. This enhancement is shown to originate from a beneficial shift in the surface reactive site energetics arising at the twinned stacking fault, whereby both the CO reaction energy and desorption energy were significantly reduced.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Temperature&#8208;Controlled Regiodivergent Borylative Cyclizations of Enynes: BCl3&#8208;Promoted Skeletal Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free borylative cyclization reactions of 1,3,5&#8208;trien&#8208;7&#8208;ynes provide straightforward access to polycyclic borylated building blocks. Depending on the temperature, either phenanthrenes (at 60&#8201;&#176;C) or phenanthrene&#8208;fused cyclobutanes (at 0&#8201;&#176;C) can be obtained selectively. The reaction at 60&#8201;&#176;C proceeds through an unusual skeletal rearrangement unprecedented in BCl3&#8208;promoted cyclizations.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free borylative cyclization of biphenyl&#8208;embedded 1,3,5&#8208;trien&#8208;7&#8208;ynes in the presence of simple and inexpensive BCl3 provided synthetically useful borylated building blocks. The outcome of the process depends on the reaction temperature, with borylated phenanthrenes obtained at 60&#8201;&#176;C and phenanthrene&#8208;fused borylated cyclobutanes formed at 0&#8201;&#176;C. Based on DFT calculations, a mechanism for these novel transformations has been proposed, which involves an uncommon skeletal rearrangement, including migration of a methyl group and alkyne fragmentation, unprecedented in BCl3&#8208;promoted cyclization reactions.

         <title>Graphdiyne: A New Carbon Allotrope for Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pristine graphdiyne shows strong electrochemiluminescent emission with S2O82&#8722; as the coreactant, which is different with other carbon allotropes and widens the electrochemiluminescence (ECL) family.







Abstract
Graphdiyne (GDY), a well&#8208;known 2D carbon allotrope, demonstrates increasing fantastic performance in various fields owing to its outstanding electronic properties. Owing to its unique properties, electrochemiluminescence (ECL) technology is one powerful tool for understanding fundamental questions and for ultrasensitive sensing and imaging. Here, we firstly find that GDY without any functionalization or treatment shows a strong ECL emission with potassium persulfate (K2S2O8) as coreactant, which is totally different with other carbon allotropes. Mechanistic study indicates that the ECL emission of GDY is generated by the surface state transition. Interestingly, ECL is generated at 705&#8197;nm in the near infrared region with an ECL efficiency of 424&#8201;% compared to that of Ru(bpy)3Cl2/K2S2O8. The study demonstrates a new character of GDY in ECL investigation and sets the stage for the development of GDY for emerging applications, including imaging and light&#8208;emitting devices.

         <title>Sensitive, Efficient and Portable Analysis of Molecular Exchange Processes by Hyperpolarized Ultrafast NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hyperpolarized ultrafast diffusion exchange spectroscopy method is introduced, which allows highly sensitive and efficient quantification of molecular exchange rates by using low&#8208;cost, low&#8208;field, single&#8208;sided and portable NMR instruments. The method can be used to investigate exchange processes in many fields ranging from intra&#8208;extracellular exchange of metabolites to atmospheric surfactant solutions.







Abstract
Molecular exchange processes are ubiquitous in nature. Here, we introduce a method to analyze exchange processes by using low&#8208;cost, portable, single&#8208;sided NMR instruments. The inherent magnetic field inhomogeneity of the single&#8208;sided instruments is exploited to achieve diffusion contrast of exchange sites and spatial encoding of 2D data. This so&#8208;called ultrafast diffusion exchange spectroscopy method shortens the experiment time by two to four orders of magnitude. Furthermore, because full 2D data are measured in a single scan (in a fraction of a second), the sensitivity of the experiment can be improved by several orders of magnitude using so&#8208;called nuclear spin hyperpolarization methods (in this case, dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization). As the first demonstration of the feasibility of the method in various applications, we show that the method enables quantification of intra&#8208; and extracellular exchange of water in a yeast cell suspension.

         <title>Flexible Cuprous Triazolate Frameworks as Highly Stable and Efficient Electrocatalysts for CO2 Reduction with Tunable C2H4/CH4 Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible Cu(I) triazolate frameworks functionalized with dinuclear copper sites can serve as highly stable and efficient electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction to C2H4/CH4, and the selectivity is tunable by the size of uncoordinated ligand side groups.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks have attracted much attention for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, but they are generally instable and difficult to control the product selectivity. We report flexible Cu(I) triazolate frameworks as efficient, stable, and tunable electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction to C2H4/CH4. By changing the size of ligand side groups, the C2H4/CH4 selectivity ratio can be gradually tuned and inversed from 11.8&#8201;:&#8201;1 to 1&#8201;:&#8201;2.6, giving C2H4, CH4, and hydrocarbon selectivities up to 51&#8201;%, 56&#8201;%, and 77&#8201;%, respectively. After long&#8208;term electrocatalysis, they can retain the structures/morphologies without formation of Cu&#8208;based inorganic species. Computational simulations showed that the coordination geometry of Cu(I) changed from triangular to tetrahedral to bind the reaction intermediates, and two adjacent Cu(I) cooperated for C&#8722;C coupling to form C2H4. Importantly, the ligand side groups controlled the catalyst flexibility by the steric hindrance mechanism, and the C2H4 pathway is more sensitive than the CH4 one.

         <title>Spatially Selective Monitoring of Subcellular Enzyme Dynamics in Response to Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional nanoplatform was constructed for in situ imaging of the subcellular enzyme dynamics in response to near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;triggered, mitochondria&#8208;targeted photodynamic therapy (PDT). With this versatile nanodevice, mitochondrial accumulation of specific enzymes was visualized in response to the increased concentration of reactive oxygen species during PDT.







Abstract
Tracking spatial and temporal dynamics of bioactive molecules such as enzymes responding to therapeutic treatment is highly important for understanding of the related functions. However, in situ molecular imaging at subcellular level during photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been hampered by the limitations of existing methods. Herein, we present a multifunctional nanoplatform (termed as UR&#8208;HAPT) that is able to simultaneously monitor subcellular dynamics of human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) during the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;mediated PDT. UR&#8208;HAPT was constructed by the combination of an upconversion nanoparticle&#8208;based PDT design and a mitochondria&#8208;targeting strategy with an APE1&#8208;responsive DNA reporter. Benefiting from the gain&#8208;of&#8208;function approach, activatable mitochondrial accumulation of APE1 in response to the oxidative stress was observed during the NIR light&#8208;triggered, mitochondria&#8208;targeted PDT process. We envision that this nanoplatform can be applicable to screen and evaluate potential enzyme inhibitors to improve the PDT efficacy.

         <title>Controlled Synthesis of Cyclic&#8208;Helical Polymers with Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of chirally cyclic PdII catalysts were developed that initiated a living ring&#8208;expansion polymerization of isocyanides, providing cyclic polymers with precise molecular weight and low dispersity. Owing to the single&#8208;handed helical backbone, these polymers showed interesting circularly polarized luminescence with tuneable handedness and dissymmetric factor.







Abstract
Cyclic polymers attract attention because of their endless structure and unique properties, which differ from the linear analogs. However, the synthesis of cyclic polymers is difficult and prohibits their functions and applications. In this study, we reported chiral cyclic PdII&#8208;catalysts that initiate a living ring&#8208;expansion polymerization of isocyanides, yielding a single&#8208;handed cyclic&#8208;helical poly(phenyl isocyanide), with predictable molecular weight (Mn) and low dispersity (Mw/Mn), in good yield. Using this method, cyclic bottlebrush polymers were prepared via the grafting&#8208;onto strategy. The cyclic topology was confirmed using various spectroscopic data and atomic force microscope observation. Moreover, the cyclic polymer brushes, comprising of a one&#8208;handed helical backbone, showed interesting photoluminescence and circularly&#8208;polarized luminescence.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Photosensitizer Nanosheets via Low&#8208;Energy Electron Beam Induced Cross&#8208;Linking of Self&#8208;Assembled RuII Polypyridine Monolayers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large area &#8776;1&#8197;nm thick molecular photosensitizer nanosheets are synthesized via electron irradiation induced cross&#8208;linking of RuII polypyridine monolayers. Their physical and chemical properties are promising for applications in two&#8208;dimensional photocatalytic systems.







Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis for hydrogen production is an important element in the search for green energy sources. The incorporation of photoactive units into mechanically stable 2D materials paves the way toward the realization of ultrathin membranes as mimics for leaves. Here we present and compare two concepts to introduce a photoactive RuII polypyridine complex into &#8776;1&#8197;nm thick carbon nanomembranes (CNMs) generated by low&#8208;energy electron irradiation induced cross&#8208;linking of aromatic self&#8208;assembled monolayers. The photoactive units are either directly incorporated into the CNM scaffold or covalently grafted to its surface. We characterize RuII CNMs using X&#8208;ray photoelectron, surface&#8208;enhanced Raman, photothermal deflection spectroscopy, atomic force, scanning electron microscopy, and study their photoactivity in graphene field&#8208;effect devices. Therewith, we explore the applicability of low&#8208;energy electron irradiation of metal complexes for photosensitizer nanosheet formation.

         <title>Actuation of Liquid Crystalline Elastomers at or Below Ambient Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid crystal elastomers with actuation temperatures at or below ambient temperature are prepared via a sequential thiol&#8208;Michael/thiol&#8211;ene reaction scheme based on the monomer C6BAPE. The reduction in actuation temperature is accompanied by an increase in actuation rate (&gt;6&#8201;%&#8201;&#176;C&#8722;1). The low actuation temperatures achieved are promising for use in many applications at ambient temperature or below.







Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCE) are an emerging class of material actuators. LCE undergo macroscopic dimensional changes when subjected to a stimulus. The large stimuli&#8208;response of LCE is associated with thermotropic disruption of order. Historically, comparatively high temperatures are required to disrupt orientation in LCE to achieve meaningful work output. Here, we introduce an approach to prepare LCE via thiol&#8208;Michael/thiol&#8211;ene reactions that actuate at or below ambient temperature. Alignment was imparted to the LCE by mechanical alignment and 3D printing. The LCE materials detailed here achieve strains of 40&#8201;% with a maximum deformation rate of 6.5&#8201;%&#8201;&#176;C&#8722;1. The functional utility of the tunability of the thermotropic response of these materials is illustrated in reconfiguration triggered via body heat and sequential actuation of a multi&#8208;material element.

         <title>Non&#8208;Equal Ratio Cocrystal Engineering to Improve Charge Transport Characteristics of Organic Semiconductors: A Case Study on Indolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazole</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The packing structures of organic semiconductors can be tailored through non&#8208;equal ratio cocrystallization, which leads to significantly improved charge transport characteristics relative to the single&#8208;component material. As an example, a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 cocrystal displays a more appropriate herringbone stacking structure with a pronounced increase in both the electronic coupling and intermolecular distances compared to the 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 cocrystal and single&#8208;component crystal.







Abstract
Rare studies of cocrystal engineering have focused on improving carrier mobility of organic semiconductors mainly because of the generation of ambipolarity, the alteration of the charge carrier polarity or the reduction of electronic couplings. Herein, we utilize indolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazole (IC) as the model compound and 2,6&#8208;diphenylanthraquinone (DPAO) and 9&#8208;fluorenone (FO) as the coformers to construct IC2&#8208;DPAO and IC&#8208;FO cocrystals with 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 or 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratios, respectively, through hydrogen bonds and donor&#8211;acceptor interactions. Interestingly, the more appropriate packing structure, possessing not only enhanced electronic couplings but also increased intermolecular distances, is achieved in IC2&#8208;DPAO, which shows an improved carrier mobility of 0.11&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 by four orders of magnitude relative to the IC crystal. These results suggest that non&#8208;equal ratio cocrystal engineering opens up the possibility to develop organic semiconductors with enhanced charge transport behaviors.

Herein, we utilize indolo[2,3-a]carbazole (IC) as the model compound and 2,6-diphenylanthraquinone (DPAO) and 9-fluorenone (FO) as the coformers to construct IC2-DPAO and IC-FO cocrystals with 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 or 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratios, respectively, through hydrogen bonds and donor&#8211;acceptor interactions. Interestingly, the more appropriate packing structure, possessing not only enhanced electronic couplings but also increased intermolecular distances, is achieved in IC2-DPAO, which shows an improved carrier mobility of 0.11&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; by four orders of magnitude relative to the IC crystal. These results suggest that non-equal ratio cocrystal engineering opens up the possibility to develop organic semiconductors with enhanced charge transport behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Thioester&#8208;Assisted Sortase&#8208;A&#8208;Mediated Ligation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 28, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sortase A was found to mediate the efficient and irreversible ligation of a protein/peptide containing a C&#8208;terminal thioester with another protein/peptide bearing an N&#8208;terminal Gly, with broad tolerance for a wide variety of LPxT&#8208;derived sequences. The thioester&#8208;assisted SrtA&#8208;mediated ligation strategy enabled the expedient preparation of proteins bearing various N&#8208; or C&#8208;terminal labels and post&#8208;translationally modified proteins.







Abstract
Sortase A (SrtA)&#8208;mediated ligation, a popular method for protein labeling and semi&#8208;synthesis, is limited by its reversibility and dependence on the LPxTG motif, where &#8220;x&#8221; is any amino acid. Here, we report that SrtA can mediate the efficient and irreversible ligation of a protein/peptide containing a C&#8208;terminal thioester with another protein/peptide bearing an N&#8208;terminal Gly, with broad tolerance for a wide variety of LPxT&#8208;derived sequences. This strategy, the thioester&#8208;assisted SrtA&#8208;mediated ligation, enabled the expedient preparation of proteins bearing various N&#8208; or C&#8208;terminal labels, including post&#8208;translationally modified proteins such as the Ser139&#8208;phosphorylated histone H2AX and Lys9&#8208;methylated histone H3, with less dependence on the LPxTG motif. Our study validates the chemical modification of substrates as an effective means of augmenting the synthetic capability of existing enzymatic methods.

Theoretical and experimental studies reveal that nitro constitutional isomerism is key to zincophilic activity and redox kinetics.  p  &#8208;DB hosted in carbon nanoflower harvests a high capacity of 402 mAh g  &#8722;1  and superior stability up to 25,000 cycles at 5 A g  &#8722;1  , giving a Zn&#8722;organic battery a high energy density of 230 Wh kg  &#8722;1  . An anionic co&#8208;insertion charge storage mechanism is proposed, entailing two&#8208;step (de)coordination of Zn(CF  3  SO  3  )  +  with nitro oxygen. Besides, dinitrobenzene can be electrochemically optimized by side group regulation  via  implanting electron&#8208;withdrawing motifs. This work opens a new window to design multielectron nitroaromatics for Zn&#8208;organic batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterogenised molecular catalysts for sustainable electrochemical CO2 reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There has been a rapid rise in interest regarding the advantages of support materials to protect and immobilise molecular catalysts for the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) in order to overcome the weaknesses of many well&#8208;known catalysts in terms of their stability and selectivity. In this review, the state of the art of different catalyst&#8208;support systems for the CO2RR shall be commented with the intention of leading towards standard benchmarking for comparison of such systems across all support strategies, taking into account these multiple pertinent metrics, and also enabling clearer consideration of the necessary steps for further progress. The perspective of which are the most promising support systems, alongside a final note on the need for development of more advanced experimental and computational techniques will be projected to aid the rational design principles that would be prerequisite to prospective industrial upscaling.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The asymmetric synthesis of cyclopentachromenones from gold&#8208;catalyzed reaction of readily available skipped alkenynones is described. This cascade reaction involves an initial  anti  &#8208;Michael hydroarylation of the ynone moiety to form a gold&#8208;functionalized dialkenylketone intermediate, followed by a Nazarov cyclization that proceeds in an unprecedented enantioselective manner. Excellent enantiomeric ratios and chemical yields are obtained under mild reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Seeded Polymerization in Block Copolymer Nanoparticles: Post&#8208;Assembly Control of Colloidal Features</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Post&#8208;assembly modifications are efficient tools to adjust colloidal features of block copolymer (BCP) particles. However, existing methods often address particle shape, morphology, and chemical functionality individually. For simultaneous control, we transferred the concept of seeded polymerization to phase separated BCP particles. Key to our approach is the regioselective polymerization of (functional) monomers inside specific BCP domains. This was demonstrated in striped PS&#8208;b&#8208;P2VP ellipsoids. Here, polymerization of styrene preferably occurs in PS domains and increases PS lamellar thickness up to 5&#8208;fold. The resulting asymmetric lamellar morphology also changes the particle shape, i.e., increases the aspect ratio. Using 4&#8208;vinylbenzyl azide as co&#8208;monomer, azides as chemical functionalities can be added selectively to the PS domains. Overall, our simple and versatile method gives access to various multifunctional BCP colloids from a single batch of pre&#8208;formed particles.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Field NMR, Reactivity, and DFT Modeling Reveal the &#947;&#8208;Al2O3 Surface Hydroxyl Network.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aluminas are strategic materials used in many major industrial processes, either as catalyst supports or as catalysts in their own right. The transition alumina &#947;&#8208;Al  2  O  3  is a privileged support, whose reactivity can be tuned by thermal activation. This study provides a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the hydroxyl groups present on the surface of &#947;&#8208;Al  2  O  3  at three different dehydroxylation temperatures. The principal [AlOH] configurations are identified and described in unprecedented detail at the molecular level. The structures were established by combining information from high&#8208;field  1  H and  27  Al solid&#8208;state NMR, IR spectroscopy and DFT calculations, as well as selective reactivity studies. Finally, the relationship between the hydroxyl structures and the molecular&#8208;level structures of the active sites in catalytic alkane metathesis is discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Small&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Additives Modulate Calcification by Interacting with Prenucleation Clusters on the Molecular Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (MW) additives can strongly impact amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC), playing an elusive role in biogenic, geologic, and industrial calcification. Here, we present molecular mechanisms by which these additives regulate stability and composition of both CaCO  3  solutions and solid ACC. Potent antiscalants inhibit ACC precipitation by interacting with prenucleation clusters (PNC); they specifically trigger and integrate into PNCs or feed PNC growth actively. Only PNC&#8208;interacting additives are traceable in ACC, considerably stabilizing it against crystallization. The selective incorporation of potent additives in PNCs is a reliable chemical label that provides conclusive chemical evidence that ACC is a molecular PNC&#8208;derived precipitate. Our results reveal additive&#8208;cluster interactions beyond established mechanistic conceptions. They reassess the role of small&#8208;MW molecules in crystallization and biomineralization while breaking grounds for new sustainable antiscalants.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Detection of Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Raman Optical Activity in an Organic Molecular Lemniscate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and Raman optical activity (ROA) were observed in a single spectroscopic experiment for a purely organic molecule, an event that had so far been limited to lanthanide&#8208;based complexes. The present observation was achieved for [16]cycloparaphenylene lemniscate, a double macrocycle constrained by a rigid 9,9'&#8208;bicarbazole subunit, which introduces a chirality source and allows the molecule to be resolved into two configurationally stable enantiomers. Distortion of oligophenylene loops in this lemniscular structure produces a large magnetic transition dipole moment while maintaining the &#960;&#8208;conjugation&#8208;induced enhancement of the Raman signal, causing the appearance of the CPL/ROA couple. A two&#8208;photon mechanism is proposed to explain the population of the lowest&#8208;energy excited electronic state prior to the simultaneous emission&#8211;scattering event.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Nickel/Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective Cross&#8208;Coupling of 1,2&#8208;Bis&#8208;Boronic Esters Enabled by 1,2&#8208;Boron Shifts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;selective transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed mono&#8208;deboronative cross&#8208;couplings of 1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;boronic esters are valuable methods for the synthesis of functionalized organoboron compounds. However, such cross&#8208;couplings are limited to reaction of the sterically less hindered primary boronic ester. Herein, we report a nickel/photoredox&#8208;catalyzed mono&#8208;deboronative arylation of 1,2&#8208;bisboronic esters that is selective for coupling of the more sterically hindered secondary/tertiary position. This is achieved by taking advantage of a 1,2&#8208;boron shift of primary &#946;&#8208;boryl radicals to the thermodynamically favored secondary/tertiary radicals, which are subsequently intercepted by the nickel catalyst to enable arylation. The mild conditions are amenable to a broad range of aryl halides to give &#946;&#8208;aryl boronic ester products in good yields and with high regioselectivity. This method also allows stereodivergent coupling of cyclic  cis&#8208;1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;boronic esters to give  trans&#8208;substituted products.</dc:description>

The mild conditions are amenable to a broad range of aryl halides to give &#946;-aryl boronic ester products in good yields and with high regioselectivity. This method also allows stereodivergent coupling of cyclic  cis-1,2-bis-boronic esters to give  trans-substituted products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxidative Elimination and Reductive Addition of Thiol&#8208;Terminated Polymer Ligands to Metal Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal nanoparticles (NPs) stabilized with thiol&#8208; (HS&#8208;) terminated polymers have applications in medicine, optoelectronics, and catalysis. It is assumed that upon exposure to oxidants or even air, these NPs lose colloidal stability&#160;due to the oxidation of the HS&#8208; end&#8208;group and elimination of polymer ligands from the NP surface, however, this mechanism does not explain unsuccessful recovery of NP stability by adding fresh HS&#8208;terminated polymers. Here we propose the oxidation of the surface metal atoms as a mechanism for the oxidative elimination of polymer from the NP surface. Based on this mechanism, we reversed NP aggregation by reducing the oxidized metal surface and re&#8208;attaching HS&#8208;terminated polymer ligands. This mechanism is general for various metal NPs and different HS&#8208;terminated polymers. We show that oxidative elimination and reductive addition reactions can improve the colloidal stability of polymer&#8208;capped metal NPs and  control their stimuli&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Structures of the Most Twisted Thioamide and Selenoamide: Effect of Higher Chalcogens of Twisted Amides on N&#8211;C(X) Resonance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amide bond replacement with planar isosteric chalcogen analogues has an important implication for the properties of the N&#8211;C(X) linkage in structural chemistry, biochemistry and organic synthesis. Herein, we report the first higher chalcogen derivatives of non&#8208;planar twisted amides. The synthesis of twisted thioamide in a versatile system has been accomplished by direct thionation without cleavage of the &#963; N&#8211;C bond. The synthesis of twisted selenoamide has been accomplished by selenation with Woollins&#8217; reagent. The structures of higher chalcogen analogues of non&#8208;planar amides were unambiguously confirmed by x&#8208;ray crystallography. Reactivity studies were conducted to determine the effect of isologous N&#8211;C(O) to N&#8211;C(X) replacement on the properties of the amide linkage. Computational studies were employed to evaluate structural and energetic parameters of amide bond alteration in higher chalcogen amides. The study provides the first experimental evidence on the effect of chalcogen isologues on the structural and electronic properties of the non&#8208;planar amide N&#8211;C(X) linkage.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biological membrane fluidity enables shape reform upon complementary biomolecule and synthetic nanoparticle encounter. Nanomedicine uses ligand&#8208;cell surface receptor affinities for nanoparticle targeting. However, due to toxicity concerns, nanoparticlebiomembrane interaction nature needs exploring to realize ligand surface density and receptor&#8208;ligand interaction effects on subsequent uptake/other interaction outcome. Herein, giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) were surface immobilized with a hCAII model receptor to study nanoparticle&#8208;complementary surface ligand interaction. We find interaction strength impacts morphological outcomes,  viz  . inter&#8208;GUV adhesion, lysis, and GUV swallowing. Nanoparticle size, receptor/ligand surface densities, overall receptor/ligand concentrations and ratios affect strength of adhesion, thus, outcome.

         <title>On&#8208;Site Nonenzymatic Orthogonal Activation of a Catalytic DNA Circuit for Self&#8208;Reinforced In Vivo MicroRNA Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The wide extracellular&#8208;intracellular distribution of microRNA requires the on&#8208;site, robust and efficient activation of catalytic DNA circuits inside live cells. Herein, we developed an efficient non&#8208;enzymatic circuitry activation strategy to realize the orthogonally controlled catalytic DNA (CCD) circuit for achieving the high&#8208;fidelity in vivo microRNA imaging through the multiply guaranteed molecular recognition and progressively accelerated signal amplification. For predictable on&#8208;site activation and competent catalytic efficiency, the dominating circuitry fuel strand was initially splitted into inactive fuel subunits that were grafted into an auxiliary catalytic circuit, where the in&#8208;cell&#8208;specific mRNA triggered the orthogonal amplification of active fuel strands for sensitive target detection through the chief entropy&#8208;driven catalytic DNA circuit.

We herein report the syntheses of the first 2,5,8&#8208;  s  &#8208;heptazine&#8208;cored organometallic complexes, together with organic analogues. The complexes exhibit outstanding 3PA cross&#8208;sections in the NIR&#8208;III and exceptional 4PA cross&#8208;sections in the new 2080&#8208;2340 nm window. We demonstrate that replacing organic donor groups by organometallic units results in an order of magnitude increase in 3PA, the &#8220;switching on&#8221; of 4PA, and a dramatic improvement in photo&#8208;stability. Our results highlight the impressive outcomes possible with an &#8220;organometalation&#8221; approach to NLO materials design.</dc:description>

         <title>Sb3+&#8211;Er3+&#8208;Codoped Cs2NaInCl6 for Emitting Blue and Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Radiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cs2NaInCl6 double perovskite was codoped with Sb3+ (s&#8208;electron) and Er3+ (f&#8208;electrons). Sb3+ provides sub&#8208;band gap (s to p) optical excitation, which de&#8208;excites via both emitting intense blue light and non&#8208;radiatively exciting f&#8208;electrons of Er3+. Then Er3+ emits 1540&#8197;nm short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) radiation. Phosphor converted light emitting diode (pc&#8208;LED) show stable performance under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Cs2NaInCl6 double perovskite is stable, environmentally benign and easy to prepare. But it has a wide band gap (5.1&#8197;eV), and therefore, does not show optical and optoelectronic properties in the visible and short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) region. Here we introduce such functionalities in Cs2NaInCl6 by codoping Sb3+ (s&#8208;electron doping) and Er3+ (f&#8208;electron doping) ions. Sb3+ doping introduces optically allowed 5s2
5s15p1 electronic absorption at the sub&#8208;band gap level, which then emits blue photoluminescence with &#8776;93&#8201;% quantum yield. But f&#8208;f electronic absorption of Er3+ is parity forbidden. Codoping Sb3+&#8211;Er3+, leads to transfer of excitation energy from Sb3+ to Er3+, yielding SWIR emission at 1540&#8197;nm. Temperature (6 to 300&#8197;K) dependent photoluminescence measurements elucidate the excitation and emission mechanism. A phosphor converted light emitting diode (pc&#8208;LED) fabricated by using the codoped sample emits stable blue and SWIR radiation over prolonged (84&#8197;hours) operation at 5.1&#8197;V.

But it has a wide band gap (5.1&#8197;eV), and therefore, does not show optical and optoelectronic properties in the visible and short-wave infrared (SWIR) region. Here we introduce such functionalities in Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NaInCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; by codoping Sb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;-electron doping) and Er&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;-electron doping) ions. Sb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; doping introduces optically allowed 5&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
5&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;5&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; electronic absorption at the sub-band gap level, which then emits blue photoluminescence with &#8776;93&#8201;% quantum yield. But &lt;i&gt;f-f&lt;/i&gt; electronic absorption of Er&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is parity forbidden. Codoping Sb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;Er&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, leads to transfer of excitation energy from Sb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; to Er&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, yielding SWIR emission at 1540&#8197;nm. Temperature (6 to 300&#8197;K) dependent photoluminescence measurements elucidate the excitation and emission mechanism. A phosphor converted light emitting diode (pc-LED) fabricated by using the codoped sample emits stable blue and SWIR radiation over prolonged (84&#8197;hours) operation at 5.1&#8197;V.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer: A New Way to Develop High&#8208;Performance Fluorescence Sensing Film towards Opto&#8208;Electronically Inert Alkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New strategies are highly demanded for fast, sensitive, selective, on&#8208;site and at real&#8208;time detection of the important but challenging alkane vapors owing to their opto&#8208;electronic inertness. Herein, we report, for the first time, a high&#8208;performance fluorescent film sensor (FFS) for the alkanes with a rationally designed through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) molecule as the sensing fluorophore. Steady&#8208;state fluorescence, femto&#8208;second transient absorption spectroscopy and theoretical studies revealed continuous TSCT dynamics in the excited U&#8208;shape molecule with increasing medium polarity. Further, the interlocked, face&#8208;to&#8208;face alignment between the donor and acceptor favors mass transport of the analyte molecules in film state. As anticipated, the compound&#8208;based FFS showed an experimental detection limit of ~10 ppm for  n  &#8208;pentane, less than 5 s for a full detection, negligible interference and super&#8208;stability, elucidating the effectiveness of the design strategy. Notably, the sensor is small (~3.7 cm  3  ), power&#8208;saving, and workable at room temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Route to Flame Aerosol Synthesis and in situ Functionalization of Mesoporous Silica</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mesoporous silica is a versatile material for energy, environmental, and medical applications. Here, for the first time, we report a flame aerosol synthesis method for a class of mesoporous silica with hollow structure and specific surface area exceeding 1000 m  2  /g. We show its superior performance in water purification, drug carrier, and thermal insulation. Moreover, we propose a general route to produce mesoporous nanoshell supported nanocatalysts by  in situ  decorating active nanoclusters, including noble metal (Pt/SiO  2  ), transition metal (Ni/SiO  2  ), metal oxide (CrO  3  /SiO  2  ), and alumina support (Co/Al  2  O  3  ). As a prototypical application, we perform dry reforming of methane using Ni/SiO  2  , achieving constant 97% CH  4  and CO  2  conversions for more than 200 hours, dramatically outperforming MCM&#8208;41 supported Ni catalyst. This work provides a scalable strategy to produce mesoporous nanoshells and proposes an  in situ  functionalization mechanism to flexible catalysts design for many reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Hexagonal Planar [B6H6] within a [B6H12] Borate complex; Structure and Bonding of [(Cp*Ti)2(&#181;&#8208;&#627;6:&#627;6&#8208;B6H6)(&#181;&#8208;H)6]</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isolation of planar [B6H6] is a long&#8208;awaited goal in boron chemistry. Several attempts in the past to stabilize [B6H6] were unsuccessful due to the domination of polyhedral geometries. Herein, we report the synthesis of a triple&#8208;decker sandwich complex of titanium [(Cp*Ti)2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;B6H6)(&#956;&#8208;H)6] (1), which features the first&#8208;ever experimentally achieved nearly planar six&#8208;membered [B6H6] ring, albeit within a [B6H12] borate. The small deviation from planarity is a direct consequence of predicted structural pattern of middle ring in 24 Valence Electron Count (VEC) triple&#8208;decker complexes. The large ring size of [B6H6] in  1  brings the metal&#8208;metal distance into the bonding range. However, significant electron delocalization from M&#8208;M bonding orbital to the bridging hydrogen and B&#8208;B skeleton in the middle decreases its bond strength.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Real&#8208;time Nanoscale Resolution of Structural Evolution and Dynamics of Fluorescent Self&#8208;assemblies by Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The visualization of self&#8208;assembled structure and dynamic at the molecular level has become a powerful method to understand structure&#8208;function relationships of self&#8208;assembly. Herein, we in situ real&#8208;time imaged the dynamic process of benzyl&#8208;naphthalimide dyes at nano scale and inspected their internal structure with minimum 2.8 nm localization accuracy through single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) imaging. We monitored the growth process of three different assemblies in situ, which possessed highly heterogeneous dynamics with different shapes and growth rates. Furthermore, diverse growth rates were also found at different sites in the same assembly. These results highlight the application of super&#8208;resolution microscopy techniques for real&#8208;time visualization of internal assembled structure and dynamic in situ.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Chemical recycling of polymers to their constituent monomers is the foremost challenge in building a sustainable circular plastics economy. Here, we reported a strategy for highly efficient depolymerization of various CO  2  &#8208;based alicyclic polycarbonates to epoxide monomers in solvent free condition by a simple Cr  III  &#8208;Salen complex mediated catalytic pyrolysis process. The chemical recycling of the widely studied poly(cyclohexene carbonate) exhibits excellent reactivity (TOF up to 3000 h  &#8208;1  , 0.1 mol% catalyst loading) and high epoxide monomer selectivity (&gt;99%). Mechanistic investigation reveals that the process proceeds in a sequential fashion  via  a  trans  &#8208;carbonate intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Alcohols as Alkylating Agents in the Cation Induced Formation of Nitrogen Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A Ti(Oi&#8208;Pr)  4  promoted 5 or 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization to make nitrogen heterocycles is presented. The utilisation of HFIP as a key solvent enables the stereoselective preparation of di&#8208; &amp; tri&#8208;substituted pyrrolidines and piperidines while forming a new C&#8208;C bond at the same time. The process is triggered by a cationic intermediate generated from an allylic or benzylic alcohol and leads to the simultaneous generation of both a C&#8208;C and a C&#8208;N bond in a single step. Notably, either 2,3&#8208;trans or 2,3&#8208;cis substituted heterocycles can be obtained by using a nucleophilic amine bearing different substituents. Lastly, the stereoselective synthesis of enantiopure products was achieved by using readily available enantiopure acyclic starting materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Zr&#8208;oxo Nodes of MOFs with Tunable Electronic Properties Provide Effective &#8226;OH Species for Enhanced Methane Hydroxylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct conversion of methane to high value&#8208;added oxygenates under mild conditions has attracted extensive interest. However, the over&#8208;oxidation of target products is usually unavoidable due to the easily excessive activation of C&#8208;H bond on the sites of supported metal species. Here, we identified the most efficient Zr&#8208;oxo nodes of UiO&#8208;66 Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) catalysts for the selective oxidation of methane with H2O2  oxidant, which adopted the modification strategy by three types of benzene 1, 4&#8208;dicarboxylates (NH2&#8208;BDC, H2BDC, and NO2&#8208;BDC, respectively). Detailed characterizations and DFT calculations revealed that these ligands can effectively tune the electronic property of Zr&#8208;oxo nodes and the H2BDC ligand led to proper electronic density of Zr&#8208;oxo nodes in UiO&#8208;66. Consequently, this UiO&#8208;66&#8208;H catalyst can promote the formation of effective &#8226;OH species that adsorbed on Zr&#8208;oxo nodes, which facilitated the activation of methane with a lower energy barrier and subsequent conversion to hydroxylation oxygenates with 100% selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Ti3C2Tx MXene&#8208;Based Ionic Diode Membrane for High&#8208;Efficient Osmotic Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioinspired asymmetric nanofluidic ion channels with ionic diode behavior that can boost the osmotic energy (so&#8208;called blue energy) conversion are highly desirable, especially if they can be easily constructed and modified. Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal carbides and nitrides, known as MXenes, combine hydrophilic surfaces and tunable surface charge properties, providing a shortcut to prepare asymmetric nanofluidic ion channels. Here, we report a mechanically robust, flexible, and scale&#8208;up&#8208;friendly asymmetric Ti3C2Tx MXene&#8208;based ionic diode membrane with a highly rectified current and demonstrate its potential use in reverse electrodialysis osmotic energy conversion. Under the salinity gradient of synthetic seawater and river water, our ionic diode membrane&#8208;based generator's power density is 8.6 W m&#8208;2 and up to 17.8 W m&#8208;2 at a 500&#8208;fold salinity gradient, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes. The design of MXene&#8208;based ionic diode&#8208;type membrane provides a facile and general strategy in developing large&#8208;scale 2D nanofluidics and selective ion transport.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced, Single&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed, Directed C&#8722;H Functionalization: Metal&#8208;Substrate&#8208;Bound Complexes as Light&#8208;Harvesting Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in photochemical C&#8722;H functionalization reactions using a single metal catalyst to enable sustainable strategies for the functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds under ambient conditions without an external photosensitizer are highlighted in this Minireview. Reaction mechanisms and the role of visible light are described, and future perspectives and challenges to stimulate future research directions in the field of light&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H functionalization are discussed.







Abstract
C&#8722;H functionalization represents one of the most rapidly advancing areas in organic synthesis and is regarded as one of the key concepts to minimize the ecological and economic footprint of organic synthesis. The ubiquity and low reactivity of C&#8722;H bonds in organic molecules, however, poses several challenges, and often necessitates harsh reaction conditions to achieve this goal, although it is highly desirable to achieve C&#8722;H functionalization reactions under mild conditions. Recently, several reports uncovered a conceptually new approach towards C&#8722;H functionalization, where a single transition&#8208;metal complex can be used as both the photosensitizer and catalyst to promote C&#8722;H bond functionalization in the absence of an exogeneous photosensitizer. In this Minireview, we will provide an overview on recent achievements in C&#8722;H functionalization reactions, with an emphasis on the photochemical modulation of the reaction mechanism using such catalysts.

         <title>Homochiral Multiferroic Cyanido&#8208;Bridged Dimetallic Complexes Assembled by C&#8722;F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;K Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first homochiral multiferroic dimetallic cyanides were constructed by the introduction of rarely seen C&#8722;F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;K interactions, which show a saturated polarization of 9.4&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2, larger than those of other ferroelectric dimetallic cyanides.







Abstract
Cyanido&#8208;bridged dimetallic complexes are attracting attention due to their varied structures and properties. However, homochiral cyanido&#8208;bridged dimetallic complexes are rare, and making them ferroelectric is a great challenge. Introducing C&#8722;F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;K interactions between the guest chiral cations and the host [KFe(CN)6]2&#8722; framework, gives three&#8208;dimensional cyanido&#8208;bridged dimetallic multiferroics, [R&#8208; and S&#8208;3&#8208;fluoropyrrolidinium]2[KFe(CN)6] (R&#8208; and S&#8208;3&#8208;FPC). The mirror&#8208;symmetric vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) signal shows their enantiomeric nature. R&#8208; and S&#8208;3&#8208;FPC crystallize in the same chiral&#8208;polar space group P21 at 298&#8197;K. Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), polarizing optical microscopy, and temperature&#8208;dependent second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) measurements show their multiferroic properties (the coexistence of ferroelectricity and ferroelasticity), in line with the Aizu notation of 222F2. R&#8208;3&#8208;FPC shows excellent ferroelectricity with saturated polarization up to 9.4&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Chemically Tuning Attractive and Repulsive Interactions between Solubilizing Oil Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We systematically characterize The influence of oil chemical structure, nonionic surfactant structure, and surfactant concentration on the interfacial tensions and Marangoni flows of solubilizing oil&#8208;in&#8208;water drops is characterized systematically. Three regimes corresponding to droplet &#8220;attraction&#8221;, &#8220;repulsion&#8221;, or &#8220;inactivity&#8221; are identified and the chemical trends leading to these behaviors are discussed.







Abstract
Micellar solubilization is a transport process occurring in surfactant&#8208;stabilized emulsions that can lead to Marangoni flow and droplet motility. Active droplets exhibit self&#8208;propulsion and pairwise repulsion due to solubilization processes and/or solubilization products raising the droplet's interfacial tension. Here, we report emulsions with the opposite behavior, wherein solubilization decreases the interfacial tension and causes droplets to attract. We characterize the influence of oil chemical structure, nonionic surfactant structure, and surfactant concentration on the interfacial tensions and Marangoni flows of solubilizing oil&#8208;in&#8208;water drops. Three regimes corresponding to droplet &#8220;attraction&#8221;, &#8220;repulsion&#8221; or &#8220;inactivity&#8221; are identified. We believe these studies contribute to a fundamental understanding of solubilization processes in emulsions and provide guidance as to how chemical parameters can influence the dynamics and chemotactic interactions between active droplets.

         <title>Coordination Chemistry Engineered Polymeric Carbon Nitride Photoanode with Ultralow Onset Potential for Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By engineering the film/substrate interface via coordination chemistry, a polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) photoanode featuring intimate contact between the PCN film and the titanium&#8208;coated fluorine&#8208;doped SnO2 (FTO) substrate was derived. Benefitting from the substantially reduced interfacial resistance credited by the strong coordination interaction, a record ultralow onset potential which enables unbiased water splitting is achieved.







Abstract
Construction of an intimate film/substrate interface is of great importance for a photoelectrode to achieve efficient photoelectrochemical performance. Inspired by coordination chemistry, a polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) film is intimately grown on a Ti&#8208;coated substrate by an in situ thermal condensation process. The as&#8208;prepared PCN photoanode exhibits a record low onset potential (Eonset) of &#8722;0.38&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a decent photocurrent density of 242&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;VRHE for water splitting. Detailed characterization confirms that the origin of the ultralow onset potential is mainly attributed to the substantially reduced interfacial resistance between the Ti&#8208;coated substrate and the PCN film benefitting from the constructed interfacial sp2 N&#8594;Ti coordination bonds. For the first time, the ultralow onset potential enables the PCN photoanode to drive water splitting without external bias with a stable photocurrent density of &#8776;9&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 up to 1&#8197;hour.

         <title>A Cobalamin&#8208;Dependent Radical SAM Enzyme Catalyzes the Unique C&#945;&#8208;Methylation of Glutamine in Methyl&#8208;Coenzyme&#8197;M Reductase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enzyme responsible for the unique C&#945;&#8208;methylation of a glutamine residue within methyl&#8208;coenzyme M reductase was identified. Biochemical, spectroscopic and mass spectrometric characterization clearly classify the newly identified glutamine C&#8208;methyltransferase as a cobalamin&#8208;dependent radical SAM enzyme and, thus, as a new member of the class B radical SAM methyltransferase family.







Abstract
Methyl&#8208;coenzyme M reductase, which is responsible for the production of the greenhouse gas methane during biological methane formation, carries several unique posttranslational amino acid modifications, including a 2&#8208;(S)&#8208;methylglutamine. The enzyme responsible for the C&#945;&#8208;methylation of this glutamine is not known. Herein, we identify and characterize a cobalamin&#8208;dependent radical SAM enzyme as the glutamine C&#8208;methyltransferase. The recombinant protein from Methanoculleus thermophilus binds cobalamin in a base&#8208;off, His&#8208;off conformation and contains a single [4Fe&#8208;4S] cluster. The cobalamin cofactor cycles between the methyl&#8208;cob(III)alamin, cob(II)alamin and cob(I)alamin states during catalysis and produces methylated substrate, 5&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine and S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;homocysteine in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio. The newly identified glutamine C&#8208;methyltransferase belongs to the class B radical SAM methyltransferases known to catalyze challenging methylation reactions of sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Glidomides and Elucidation of Different Mechanisms for Formation of &#946;&#8208;OH Amino Acid Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glidomides include two unusual amino acid residues: threo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;OH&#8208;L&#8208;His and threo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;OH&#8208;D&#8208;Asp. GlmD independently catalyzes the hydroxylation of L&#8208;Asp to primarily produce threo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;OH&#8208;L&#8208;Asp on the thiolation domain and then undergoes epimerization to form threo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;OH&#8208;D&#8208;Asp in the final products. The &#946;&#8208;hydroxylation of His requires the concerted action of GlmF and the interface (I) domain, a novel condensation domain family clade.







Abstract
Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) can incorporate nonproteinogenic amino acids into peptidyl backbones to increase structural diversity. Genome mining of Schlegelella brevitalea led to the identification of a class of linear lipoheptapeptides, glidomides, featuring two unusual residues: threo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;OH&#8208;L&#8208;His and threo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;OH&#8208;D&#8208;Asp. The &#946;&#8208;hydroxylation of Asp and His is catalyzed by the nonheme FeII/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent &#946;&#8208;hydroxylases GlmD and GlmF, respectively. GlmD independently catalyzes the hydroxylation of L&#8208;Asp to primarily produce threo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;OH&#8208;L&#8208;Asp on the thiolation domain, and then undergoes epimerization to form threo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;OH&#8208;D&#8208;Asp in the final products. However, &#946;&#8208;hydroxylation of His requires the concerted action of GlmF and the interface (I) domain, a novel condensation domain family clade. The key sites of I domain for interaction with GlmF were identified, suggesting that the mechanism for hydroxylation of His depends on the collaboration between hydroxylase and NRPS.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Benzylic Addition Reactions of Alkylarenes to Michael Acceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of alkylarenes as nucleophile precursors in benzylic addition is challenging because the benzylic hydrogen atoms of these compounds are inert to deprotonation. Herein, we report Rh&#8208;catalyzed benzylic addition of alkylarenes to Michael acceptors for the formation of C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp3) bonds. The catalyst is proposed to activate the aromatic ring via &#951;6&#8208;coordination, dramatically facilitating deprotonation of the unactivated benzylic C&#8211;H bond and addition of the resulting carbanion to the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated double bond in the absence of bases. Notably, this byproduct&#8208;free method provides an access to all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers through the development of ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Catalysis between a Dipeptide Phosphonium Salt and a Metal&#8208;Based Lewis Acid for Asymmetric Synthesis of N&#8208;Bridged [3.2.1] Ring Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we presented an unprecedented synergic catalytic protocol for asymmetric construction of fluorinated  N  &#8208;bridged [3.2.1] cyclic members of tropane family via bifunctional phosphonium salt/silver co&#8208;catalyzed cyclization process. A broad variety of substrates bearing an assortment of functional groups are compatible with this protocol, providing targeted compounds bearing seven&#8208;membered ring and four contiguous stereocenters in high yields with excellent stereoselectivities. The gram&#8208;scale preparations, facile elaborations and preliminary biological activities of the products demonstrated the applicable potential. Moreover, both experimental and computational mechanistic studies revealed that the cyclization proceeded via an ingenious &#8220;sandwich&#8221; reaction model with multiple weak&#8208;bond cooperative activations. Insights gained from our studies are expected to advance general efforts towards the catalytic synthesis of challenging chiral heterocyclic molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Hydrogenation of 9&#8208;Phenanthrols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enantioselective hydrogenation of arenols to corresponding chiral cyclic alcohols remains a challenge because of their aromaticity and the difficulty in controlling the regio&#8208;, chemo&#8208;, and stereoselectivity. In this work, the first highly efficient ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrogenation of 9&#8208;phenanthrols has been successfully realized under mild conditions via trapping the unstable keto tautomers.The method provides a facile access to a range of chiral 9,10&#8208;dihydrophenanthren&#8208;9&#8208;ols with up to 98% yield and &gt;99%  ee  . The hydrogenation pathway includes base&#8208;promoted tautomerization of 9&#8208;phenanthrols and Ru&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of the  in situ  generated unstable keto tautomers.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three&#8208;membered rings (3&#8208;rings) are an important structural motif in zeolite chemistry, but their formation remains serendipitous in reticular chemistry when designing zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs). Herein, we report a design principle for constructing four new ZIFs, termed ZIF&#8208;1001 to &#8208;1004, from tetrahedral ZnII  centers (T), benzotriazolate (bTZ), and different functionalized benzimidazolates (RbIM) that adopt a new zeolite NPO&#8208;type topology built from 3&#8208;rings. Two factors were critical for this discovery: (i) incorporating the bTZ linker within the structures formed 3&#8208;rings due to a &#8736;(T&#8211;bTZ&#8211;T) angle of 120&#8208;130&#176; reminiscent of the &#8736;(Ge&#8211;O&#8211;Ge) angle (130&#176;) observed in germanate zeolite&#8208;type structures having 3&#8208;rings; and (ii) RbIM guided the coordination chemistry of bTZ to bind preferentially in an imidazolate&#8208;type mode. This series&#8217; ability to selectively capture CO  2  from high&#8208;humidity flue gas and trap ethane from tail gas during shale gas extraction was demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Switchable Electrostatically Templated Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a switchable templated polymerization system where the strength of the templating effect can be modulated by solution pH and/or ionic strength. The responsiveness to these cues is incorporated through a dendritic polyamidoamine&#8208;based template of which the charge density depends on pH. The dendrimers act as a template for the polymerization of an oppositely charged monomer, namely sodium styrene sulfonate. We show that the rate of polymerization and maximum achievable monomer conversion are directly related to the charge density of the template, and hence the environmental pH. The polymerization could effectively be switched &#8216;ON&#8217; and &#8216;OFF&#8217; on demand, by cycling between acidic and alkaline reaction environments. These findings break ground for a novel concept, namely harnessing co&#8208;assembly of a template and growing polymer chains with tunable association strength to create and control coupled polymerization and self&#8208;assembly pathways of (charged) macromolecular building blocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Diversification of Aryl Sulfonyl Compounds through Ligand Controlled meta&#8208; and para&#8208;C&#8208;H Borylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryl sulfones and aryl sulfonamides are of great importance in organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry. Although ortho  &#8208;C&#8208;H functionalization of aryl sulfonyl compounds has been extensively explored, the functionalization of remote meta&#8208;  and para  &#8208;C&#8208;H bonds is very rare. Herein, we report a tunable meta&#8208;  and para  &#8208;selective C&#8208;H borylation of aryl sulfonyl compounds enabled by computationally designed ligands and iridium catalyst. This method is capable of accommodating a broad range of substrates under mild reaction conditions. Gram&#8208;scale preparation can be achieved with iridium catalyst loading as low as 0.1 mol%. As the introduced boronate group can be easily converted into many other groups, our method provides a general solution to installing functional groups at either meta  &#8208; or para  &#8208;position of aryl sulfones and aryl sulfonamides with good to excellent selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving over 18% Efficiency Organic Solar Cell Enabled by a ZnO&#8208;Based Hybrid Electron Transport Layer with an Operational Lifetime up to 5 Years</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although organic solar cells (OSCs) have delivered impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 19%, most of them demonstrated rather limited stability. So far, there are hardly any effective and universal strategies to improve stability of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OSCs. Herein, we developed a hybrid electron transport layer (ETL) in inverted OSCs using ZnO and a new modifying agent (NMA), and significantly improved stability and PCEs for all the tested devices. In particular, when applied in D18:N3 system, its inverted OSC exhibits so far the highest PCE (18.20%) among inverted single&#8208;junction OSCs, demonstrating an extrapolated T80 lifetime of 7572 h (equivalent to 5 years under outdoor exposure). This is the first report with T80 over 5000 h among OSCs with over 18% PCEs. Furthermore, a high PCE of 16.12% can be realized even in large&#8208;area device (1 cm2). This hybrid ETL strategy provide a strong stimulus for highly prospective commercialization of OSCs.</dc:description>

Herein, we developed a hybrid electron transport layer (ETL) in inverted OSCs using ZnO and a new modifying agent (NMA), and significantly improved stability and PCEs for all the tested devices. In particular, when applied in D18:N3 system, its inverted OSC exhibits so far the highest PCE (18.20%) among inverted single-junction OSCs, demonstrating an extrapolated T80 lifetime of 7572 h (equivalent to 5 years under outdoor exposure). This is the first report with T80 over 5000 h among OSCs with over 18% PCEs. Furthermore, a high PCE of 16.12% can be realized even in large-area device (1 cm2). This hybrid ETL strategy provide a strong stimulus for highly prospective commercialization of OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulating Ti t2g Orbit&#8208;occupancy in Cu/TiO2 Composite for Selective Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electronic structure of composites plays a critical role in photocatalytic conversion, whereas it is challenging to modulate orbit for an efficient catalyst. Herein, we regulated the t2g orbital occupancy state of Ti to realize efficient CO2 conversion via adjusting the amount of photo&#8208;deposited Cu in the Cu/TiO2 composite. For the optimal sample, considerable electrons transfer from Cu d orbit to Ti t2g orbit, proved by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. The Raman spectra results also corroborates the electron enrichment on the Ti t2g orbit. Further theoretical calculations suggested that the orbital energy of Ti 3d orbit in TiO2 is declined, contributing to accepting Cu 3d electrons. As a result, the Cu/TiO2 composite exhibited the extremely high selectivity of 95.9 % for CO, and the productivity was 15.27 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, which is almost 6 times that of the original TiO2. Our work provides a strategy for designing efficient photocatalysis in the perspective of orbital regulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of All&#8208;Carbon Aromatic Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compared with heteroarenes, homogeneous asymmetric hydrogenation of all&#8208;carbon aromatic rings is a longstanding challenge in organic synthesis due to the strong aromaticity and difficult enantioselective control. Herein, we reported the rhodium/diphosphine catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of all&#8208;carbon aromatic rings, affording a series of axially chiral cyclic compounds with high enantioselectivity through desymmetrization or kinetic resolution. In addition, the central&#8208;chiral cyclic compounds were also obtained by asymmetric hydrogenation of phenanthrenes bearing a directing group. The key to success is the introduction of chiral diphosphine ligands with steric hindrance and strong electron&#8208;donating property. The axially chiral monophosphine ligands could be obtained by simple conversion of the hydrogenation products bearing the phosphine atom.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;regulated Pathway&#8208;dependent Chirality Control of Silver Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imparting chirality affords additive values, functions and responsiveness in molecular systems including nanoscale materials. Here, we report pathway dependent chirality control in silver nanoclusters (NCs). The use of enantiomeric ligand, &#945;&#8208;dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA), for the synthesis of Ag NCs leads to the preferential formation of one&#8208;handed chiral Ag29(DHLA)12  NCs with intrinsic chirality in the exterior shell composed of a silver&#8208;dithiolate framework. Small Lewis base molecules such as pyridine bind to silver atoms in the shell of NC as a guest. The guest binding reverses the relative stability between the right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed NCs upon a steric interaction with the chiral ligand DHLA in the exterior shell in a kinetic manner, leading to unprecedented chirality inversion in the synthesis of NCs. This mechanism is further extended to the self&#8208;regulation or self&#8208;replication of chirality through interNC interactions dependent on the concentration in the synthesis of NCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Intrinsic&#8208;Mitochondrial&#8208;ROS&#8208;Activated In Situ Synthesis of Trimethine Cyanines in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Environment&#8208;responsive in&#8208;situ synthesis of molecular fluorescent dyes has been a very challenging topic. Herein, we developed a photoextension strategy to make trimethine cyanines with decent conversion efficiency (up to 81%) using 1&#8208;butyl 2,3,3&#8208;trimethyl 3  H  &#8208;indole derivatives as the sole precursors, and demonstrated a free radical&#8208;participating mechanism. In the inducer&#8208;extension strategy, free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were able to mediate similar reaction with no assistance of light. Additionally, we explored a Mito&#8208;extension strategy to in situ synthesize trimethine cyanines in the living cells. The cellular ROS&#8208;dependence provided a foundation for cancer cell&#8208;preferential cyanine expression. Finally, we applied an iodized precursor as an intrinsic ROS&#8208;activated theranostic agent that integrated mitochondria&#8208;targeted cyanine synthesis, cell imaging and phototherapy.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>L&#8208;Homophenylalanine (L&#8208;HPA) is a vital building block for the synthesis of numerous chiral drugs. However, the high cost of starting materials limits the industrial production of L&#8208;HPA. In this study, an enzymatic&#8208;spontaneous chemical cascade route for L&#8208;HPA production was designed based on retrosynthetic analysis. This route, using simple benzaldehyde and pyruvate as starting materials, is extremely cost&#8208;effective. The enzymes were screened and further assembled in  E.coli, and&#160;TipheDH was identified as the rate&#8208;limiting enzyme. Therefore,  TipheDH was engineered to improve its specific activity (by 82%) and expression level (by 254%), thus generating the best strain (W14). W14 exhibited the optimum enzyme activity ratio (1.7:1.1:1:1.8) and demonstrated production of 100.9 g/L of L&#8208;HPA (with 94% conversion, &gt;99% ee) in a 5&#8208;L reactor. This route effectively exploits the power of cascades and offers insight into avenues for synthesizing other valuable chemicals from inexpensive building blocks.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA Tile Self&#8208;Assembly Guided by Base Excision Repair Enzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate here the use of DNA repair enzymes to control the assembly of DNA&#8208;based structures. To do so, we employed uracil&#8208;DNA glycosylase (UDG) and formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (Fpg), two enzymes involved in the base excision repair (BER) pathway. We designed two responsive nucleic acid modules containing mutated bases (deoxyuridine or 8&#8208;oxo&#8208;7,8&#8208; dihydroguanine recognized by UDG and Fpg, respectively) that, upon the enzyme repair activity, release a nucleic acid strand that induces the self&#8208;assembly of DNA tiles into tubular structures. The approach is programmable, specific and orthogonal and the two responsive modules can be used in the same solution without crosstalk. This allows to assemble structures formed by two different tiles in which tiles distribution can be accurately predicted as a function of the relative activity of each enzyme. Finally, we show that BER&#8208;enzymes inhibitors can also be used to control DNA&#8208;tile assembly in a specific and concentration&#8208;dependent manner .</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Dispersed MoOx on Rhodium Metallene Boosts Electrocatalyzed Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accelerating the slow water dissociation kinetics is key to boosting the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media. Here we report synthesis of atomically dispersed MoO  x  species anchored on Rh metallene using a one&#8208;pot solvothermal method. The resulting structures expose the oxide&#8208;metal interfaces to the maximum extent. This leads to a MoO  x  &#8208;Rh catalyst with ultrahigh alkaline HER activity. We obtain a mass activity of 2.32 A mg  Rh  &#8208;1  at an overpotential of 50 mV, which is 11.8 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C and surpasses the previously reported Rh&#8208;based electrocatalysts. First&#8208;principles calculations demonstrate that the interface between MoO  x  and Rh is the active center for alkaline HER. The MoO  x  sites preferentially adsorb and dissociate water molecules and adjacent Rh sites adsorb the generated atomic hydrogen for efficient H  2  evolution. Our findings illustrate the potential of atomic interface engineering strategies in electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Shell Engineering of a Au28 Nanocluster Boosts Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carboranethiolate&#8208;protected gold nanocluster Au28&#8208;S was fabricated by a facile self&#8208;reducing synthesis. Au28&#8208;S has an identical metal core to the reported Au28&#8208;C but different peripheral ligands. This ligand&#8208;shell tailoring led to obvious differences in their electronic structures and optical properties. Compared to Au28&#8208;C, Au28&#8208;S shows superior catalytic activity and selectivity for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction.







Abstract
Subtle tailoring of gold nanoclusters (NCs) could significantly change their physicochemical properties. However, direct comparison of the catalytic performance of gold NCs with identical metal cores but distinct ligand shells is rarely elucidated. In this work, a novel gold NC, Au28(C2B10H11S)12(tht)4Cl4 (Au28&#8208;S), was isolated by a facile self&#8208;reducing synthesis. Au28&#8208;S adopts an identical Au28 metal framework to that of the reported alkynyl&#8208;protected Au28&#8208;C. The different protective layers lead to distinctions in their electronic structure and optical properties. Furthermore, Au28&#8208;S shows better catalytic activity for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO. Theoretical calculations identified the active sites and shed light on the catalytic mechanism to elucidate the different catalytic performances. This work provides an ideal platform to study the protective layer&#8208;activity relationship of gold NCs, and may also provide guidance in the design of metal NC&#8208;based catalysts.

         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers (SPs) have attracted broad interest due to their intriguing features and functions. Host&#8208;guest interactions often impart tunable physicochemical properties, reversible hierarchical organization, and stimuli&#8208;responsiveness to SPs for diverse biomedical applications. Characterized by the strong yet dynamic interactions with guest molecules, cucurbit[  n  ]uril (CB[  n  ]) has shown great potential as an important building block of various functional polymers for biomedical applications. In this mini&#8208;review, we summarize the most recent examples of the design, fabrication, and biomedical applications of CB[  n  ]&#8208;based supramolecular polymers (CSPs), which are categorized into non&#8208;covalent and covalent CSPs according to the interactions between CB[  n  ] and polymer backbones. The design principles of CSPs and their unique advantages for the biomedical applications, as well as the developmental trends and future perspectives of this cross&#8208;disciplinary area are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Four&#8208;in&#8208;One Stimulus&#8208;Responsive Long&#8208;Lived Luminescent Systems Based on Pyrene&#8208;Doped Amorphous Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;lived luminescent systems are developed based on pyrene&#8208;doped polymers, where the phosphorescence exhibits radiation&#8208;, concentration&#8208;, time&#8208;, and excitation&#8208;dependent characteristics at the same time.







Abstract
Materials exhibiting ultralong luminescent lifetime show promising applications in the fields of information encryption, sensing, and bioimaging. Herein, we present a low&#8208;cost and general strategy to achieve stimulus&#8208;responsive ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) based on pyrene chromophores doped into polymer matrices. The UOP of the resulted systems presents radiation&#8208;, concentration&#8208;, time&#8208;, and excitation&#8208;dependent characteristics. The UOP color can be turned from blue to red by changing the excitation wavelength or the concentration of chromophores. Experimental results prove that these characteristics are attributed to the consumption of triplet oxygen and the different aggregation states of chromophores in the polymer matrices. Finally, we demonstrate that these systems could be applied for multilevel information encryption. This work would promote further development of multi&#8208;responsive long&#8208;lived luminescent materials.

         <title>Total Synthesis and Prediction of Ulodione Natural Products Guided by DFT Calculations
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic synthetic strategy has resulted in a two&#8208;step total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;ulodione&#8197;A and the prediction of two potential natural products, (&#177;)&#8208;ulodiones&#8197;C and D. This work was guided by computational investigations into the selectivity of a proposed biosynthetic Diels&#8211;Alder dimerization, which was then utilized in the chemical synthesis.

         <title>Imide&#8208;Functionalized Fluorenone and Its Cyanated Derivative Based n&#8208;Type Polymers: Synthesis, Structure&#8211;Property Correlations, and Thin&#8208;Film Transistor Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imide&#8208;functionalization of fluorenone and its cyanated derivative afforded new acceptors FOI and FCNI, respectively, featuring excellent solubility, high planarity, and low&#8208;lying LUMO, which enabled the resulting polymers with unique n&#8208;type transport character in organic thin&#8208;film transistors. The design strategy and synthetic routes to FOI and FCNI are highly informative for the further development of electron&#8208;deficient building blocks for n&#8208;type organic semiconductors.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors is powered by the design and synthesis of electron&#8208;deficient building blocks with optimized physicochemical properties. By meticulously installing an imide group onto fluorene and its cyanated derivative, we report here two very electron&#8208;deficient building blocks, imide&#8208;functionalized fluorenone (FOI) and its cyanated derivative (FCNI), both featuring a deep&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level down to &#8722;4.05&#8197;eV and highly coplanar framework, endowing them ideal units for constructing n&#8208;type polymers. Thus, a series of polymers are built from them, exhibiting unipolar n&#8208;type transport character with a highest electron mobility of 0.11&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Hence, FOI and FCNI offer a remarkable platform for accessing high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymers and the imide functionalization of appropriate (hetero)arenes is a powerful strategy for developing polymers with deep&#8208;lying LUMOs for n&#8208;type organic electronics.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Intermolecular Aminofluorination of Alkenes via Iodine(I)/Iodine(III) Catalysis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regio&#8208; and enantioselective, intermolecular vicinal fluoroamination of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl styrenes was achieved by enantioselective II/IIII catalysis. The transient iodonium intermediate is intercepted with nitriles, which function as both the solvent and nucleophile. In situ Ritter reaction provides direct access to the corresponding amides (up to 89&#8201;% yield). Crystallographic analyses of the &#946;&#8208;fluoroamide products show highly preorganized conformations that manifest the stereoelectronic gauche effect.







Abstract
The regio&#8208; and enantio&#8208;selective, intermolecular vicinal fluoroamination of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl styrenes has been achieved by enantioselective II/IIII catalysis. Leveraging C2&#8208;symmetric resorcinol&#8208;based aryl iodide catalysts, it has been possible to intercept the transient iodonium intermediate using simple nitriles, which function as both the solvent and nucleophile. In situ Ritter reaction provides direct access to the corresponding amides (up to 89&#8201;% yield, e.r. 93&#8201;:&#8201;7). This main group catalysis paradigm inverts the intrinsic regioselectivity of the uncatalyzed process, thereby providing facile access to tertiary, benzylic stereocenters bearing both CF3 and F groups. Privileged phenethylamine pharmacophores can be generated in which there is complete local partial charge inversion (CF3&#948;&#8722;/F&#948;&#8722; versus CH3&#948;+/H&#948;+). Crystallographic analyses of representative &#946;&#8208;fluoroamide products reveal highly pre&#8208;organized conformations that manifest the stereoelectronic gauche effect.

         <title>Unveiling the Proton&#8208;Feeding Effect in Sulfur&#8208;Doped Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur&#8208;doping in the second coordination shell of FeN4 induces the increased CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) performance relative to pristine FeN4. The proton&#8208;feeding effect after sulfur doping is demonstrated to promote protonation of *CO2 to *COOH, and thus CO2RR performances, through kinetic analysis, in situ characterization and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Heteroatom&#8208;doping in metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is considered a powerful strategy to promote the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), but the origin of enhanced catalytic activity is still elusive. Here, we disclose that sulfur doping induces an obvious proton&#8208;feeding effect for CO2RR. The model SAC catalyst with sulfur doping in the second&#8208;shell of FeN4 (Fe1&#8722;NSC) was verified by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy. Fe1&#8722;NSC exhibits superior CO2RR performance compared to sulfur&#8208;free FeN4 and most reported Fe&#8208;based SACs, with a maximum CO Faradaic efficiency of 98.6&#8201;% and turnover frequency of 1197&#8197;h&#8722;1. Kinetic analysis and in situ characterizations confirm that sulfur doping accelerates H2O activation and feeds sufficient protons for promoting CO2 conversion to *COOH, which is also corroborated by the theoretical results. This work deepens the understanding of the CO2RR mechanism based on SAC catalysts.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatic secondary&#8208;sphere interactions provide precise and systematic control over heterogeneous electrocatalytic CO2 reduction selectivity and activity in a Fe&#8208;porphyrin based MOF. Specifically, we show that MOFs allow the incorporation of molecular catalysts and positively&#8208;charged ligands one next to the other, in a manner which promotes catalysis by stabilization of reactive intermediates during electrochemical reaction conditions.

Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising platforms for heterogeneous tethering of molecular CO2 reduction electrocatalysts. Yet, to further understand electrocatalytic MOF systems, one also needs to consider their capability to fine&#8208;tune the immediate chemical environment of the active site, and thus affect its overall catalytic operation. Here, we show that electrostatic secondary&#8208;sphere functionalities enable substantial improvement of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion activity and selectivity. In situ Raman analysis reveal that immobilization of pendent positively&#8208;charged groups adjacent to MOF&#8208;residing Fe&#8208;porphyrin catalysts, stabilize weakly&#8208;bound CO intermediates, allowing their rapid release as catalytic products. Also, by varying the electrolyte's ionic strength, systematic regulation of electrostatic field magnitude was achieved, resulting in essentially 100&#8201;% CO selectivity. Thus, this concept provides a sensitive molecular&#8208;handle that adjust heterogeneous electrocatalysis on demand.

         <title>High&#8208;performance Lithium&#8211;Oxygen Batteries using a Urea&#8208;based Electrolyte&#160;with Kinetically Favorable One&#8208;electron Li2O2 Oxidation Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glymes are the most widely used electrolyte solvents in lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries (LOBs) due to their relatively high stability. However, their associated LOBs have long been plagued by large charge overpotential, which is closely related to the sluggish two&#8208;electron Li2O2 oxidation mechanism. Here, we report a new electrolyte solvent&#8212;1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylurea (TMU) for LOBs with high performance and an alternative mechanism, where a kinetically favorable one&#8208;electron Li2O2 oxidation pathway can happen in the urea electrolyte system, thus leading to a much lower charge overpotential (~0.51 V) compared to the tetraglyme&#8208;based LOBs (~1.27 V). Besides, TMU also exhibits good stability since it does not contain any alpha&#8208;hydrogen atoms that are vulnerable to be attacked by superoxide species, thus suppressing the hydrogen abstraction side reactions. Consequently, the TMU&#8208;based LOBs can stably work for more than 135 cycles, which is four times that of the tetraglyme&#8208;based LOBs (~28 cycles).</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox Generation of Isothiouronyl Radical Cations: A New Platform in Covalent Radical Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isothiouronyl radical cations have been identified as a new class of radical catalysts for the covalent activation of vinylcyclopropanes. Their generation by photoredox catalysis from N,N,N,N&#8208;tetrasubstituted thioureas provides a modular, versatile and practical platform to achieve covalent radical catalysis.







Abstract
Thiyl radicals offer unique catalytic patterns for the direct covalent activation of alkenes. However, important limitations in terms of structural diversity and handling have hampered the routine use of thiyl radicals in covalent radical catalysis. Herein, we report a new class of cationic sulfur&#8208;centered radicals to achieve covalent radical catalysis. Their generation from highly modular thioureas by photoredox catalysis make their utilization very simple and reliable. The synthetic potential and the versatility of the catalytic system were finally evaluated in a (3+2)&#8208;radical cascade between vinylcyclopropanes and olefins.

         <title>Stereodivergent Construction of 1,4&#8208;Nonadjacent Stereocenters via Hydroalkylation of Racemic Allylic Alcohols Enabled by Copper/Ruthenium Relay Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unprecedented hydroalkylation of racemic allylic alcohols and racemic ketimine esters enabled by Cu/Ru relay catalysis has been developed via merging the ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric borrowing&#8208;hydrogen reaction with copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Michael addition in a one&#8208;pot procedure. The current method enables the efficient preparation of highly functionalized &#948;&#8208;hydroxyesters bearing 1,4&#8208;nonadjacent stereocenters in good yields with high levels of diastereoselectivity and excellent enantioselectivity under mild reaction conditions. The full complement of the four stereoisomers of hydroalkylation products could be readily accessed by orthogonal permutations of two chiral metal catalysts. The current work highlights the power of relay catalysis for the stereodivergent construction of 1,4&#8208;nonadjacent stereocenters that were otherwise inaccessible.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Emeriones&#8197;A&#8211;C
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emeriones, three highly oxidized and densely functionalized polyketides, were synthesized from two enantioenriched fragments in a Stille&#8208;8&#960;/6&#960; sequence, followed by late&#8208;stage stereo&#8208; and chemoselective oxidations. This work enabled the structural revision of emerione&#8197;C.







Abstract
We report asymmetric bioinspired total syntheses of the fungal metabolites emeriones&#8197;A&#8211;C via stereoselective oxidations of two bicyclo[4.2.0]octadiene diastereomers. The central bicyclic scaffolds are prepared in an 8&#960;/6&#960; electrocyclization cascade of a stereodefined pentaene, which contains the fully assembled side chains of the emeriones. The anti&#8208;aldol side chain is made using a Paterson&#8208;aldol addition, and the epoxide of the dioxabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane side chain via ring&#8208;closure onto an oxidized acetal. Our work has enabled the structural revision of emerione&#8197;C, and resulted in the synthesis of a &#8220;missing&#8221; family member, which we call emerione&#8197;D. DFT calculations identified two methyl groups that govern torquoselectivity in the 8&#960;/6&#960; cascade.

A series of C&#8208;aryl pyranosides and furanosides were synthesized by ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;CAr&#8722;H glycosylation. Mechanistic studies suggest that the key pathway of ortho&#8208;CAr&#8722;H glycosylation involves an oxidative addition/reductive elimination process, while aryl meta&#8208;C&#8722;H glycosylation is mediated by &#963;&#8208;activation. DFT calculations showed that steric hindrance is responsible for the high stereoselectivity of meta&#8208;CAr&#8722;H glycosylation.







Abstract
C&#8208;aryl glycosides are popular basic skeletons in biochemistry and pharmaceutical chemistry. Herein, ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed highly stereo&#8208; and site&#8208;selective ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;CAr&#8722;H glycosylation is described. A series of C&#8208;aryl pyranosides and furanosides were synthesized by this method. The strategy showed good substrate scope, and various N&#8208;heterocyclic directing groups were compatible with the reaction system. A mechanistic study suggested that the key pathway of ortho&#8208;CAr&#8722;H glycosylation might involve oxidative addition/reduction elimination, whereas aryl meta&#8208;C&#8722;H glycosylation was mediated by &#963;&#8208;activation. Density functional theory calculations also showed that the high stereoselectivity of meta&#8208;CAr&#8722;H glycosylation was due to steric hindrance.

A mechanistic study suggested that the key pathway of &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;Ar&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;H glycosylation might involve oxidative addition/reduction elimination, whereas aryl &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-C&#8722;H glycosylation was mediated by &lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt;-activation. Density functional theory calculations also showed that the high stereoselectivity of &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;Ar&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;H glycosylation was due to steric hindrance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Borylation Directed Borylation of Indoles Using Pyrazabole Electrophiles: A One&#8208;Pot Route to C7&#8208;Borylated&#8208;Indolines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrophiles based on pyrazabole are simple to access reagents for the double E&#8722;H (E=N/C) borylation of N&#8722;H&#8208;indoles/indolines. Due to the robust B2N4 core of pyrazaboles and a B&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;B separation of ca. 3&#8197;&#197;, the first borylation directs the second to a proximal C&#8722;H. For N&#8722;H&#8208;indoles, C7&#8208;borylation occurs alongside reduction resulting, post work&#8208;up, in the one&#8208;pot formation of C7&#8208;BPin&#8208;indolines without requiring installation of a directing group.







Abstract
Pyrazabole (1) is a readily accessible diboron compound that can be transformed into ditopic electrophiles. In 1 (and derivatives), the B&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;B separation is ca. 3&#8197;&#197;, appropriate for one boron centre bonding to N and one to the C7 of indoles and indolines. This suitable B&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;B separation enables double E&#8722;H (E=N/C) functionalisation of indoles and indolines. Specifically, the activation of 1 with HNTf2 generates an electrophile that transforms N&#8722;H indoles and indolines into N/C7&#8208;diborylated indolines, with N&#8722;H borylation directing subsequent C7&#8722;H borylation. Indole reduction to indoline occurs before C&#8722;H borylation and our studies indicate this proceeds via hydroboration&#8212;C3&#8208;protodeboronation to produce an intermediate that then undergoes C7 borylation. The borylated products can be converted in situ into C7&#8208;BPin&#8208;N&#8208;H&#8208;indolines. Overall, this represents a transient directed C&#8722;H borylation to form useful C7&#8208;BPin&#8208;indolines.

         <title>Directing the Morphology, Packing, and Properties of Chiral Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks by Cation Exchange
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantitative exchange of metal cations has resulted in a variety of crystals having different optical and magnetic properties but with retention of the crystal shape. Crystals isolated during the exchange exhibited higher concentrations of the incoming metal cations at the hexagonal basal faces, which suggests that the nanochannels are mediating the process.







Abstract
We show that metal&#8211;organic frameworks, based on tetrahedral pyridyl ligands, can be used as a morphological and structural template to form a series of isostructural crystals having different metal ions and properties. An iterative crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal conversion has been demonstrated by consecutive cation exchanges. The primary manganese&#8208;based crystals are characterized by an uncommon space group (P622). The packing includes chiral channels that can mediate the cation exchange, as indicated by energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy on microtome&#8208;sectioned crystals. The observed cation exchange is in excellent agreement with the Irving&#8211;Williams series (Mn&lt;Fe&lt;Co&lt;Ni&lt;&#8201;Cu&gt;Zn) associated with the relative stability of the resulting coordination nodes. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the metal cation controls the optical and magnetic properties. The crystals maintain their morphology, allowing a quantitative comparison of their properties at both the ensemble and single&#8208;crystal level.

         <title>Alternative Benzoxazole Assembly Discovered in Anaerobic Bacteria Provides Access to Privileged Heterocyclic Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel biosynthetic route to a medically relevant benzoxazole scaffold was discovered in anaerobic bacteria. Genome editing, heterologous expression, and biotransformation studies show that the pathway invokes specialized precursors, backbone assembly, and heterocyclization to form closoxazoles. The biocatalysts involved display synthetic utility, and prompted the genomics&#8208;driven identification of cryptic gene clusters in diverse bacterial phyla.







Abstract
Benzoxazole scaffolds feature prominently in diverse synthetic and natural product&#8208;derived pharmaceuticals. Our understanding of their bacterial biosynthesis is, however, limited to ortho&#8208;substituted heterocycles from actinomycetes. We report an overlooked biosynthetic pathway in anaerobic bacteria (typified in Clostridium cavendishii) that expands the benzoxazole chemical space to meta&#8208;substituted heterocycles and heralds a distribution beyond Actinobacteria. The first benzoxazoles from the anaerobic realm (closoxazole A and B) were elucidated by NMR and chemical synthesis. By genome editing in the native producer, heterologous expression in Escherichia coli, and systematic pathway dissection we show that closoxazole biosynthesis invokes an unprecedented precursor usage (3&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxybenzoate) and manner of assembly. Synthetic utility was demonstrated by the precursor&#8208;directed biosynthesis of a tafamidis analogue. A bioinformatic survey reveals the pervasiveness of related gene clusters in diverse bacterial phyla.

         <title>Eu2P2S6: The First Rare&#8208;Earth Chalcogenophosphate Exhibiting Large Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation Response and High Laser&#8208;Induced Damage Threshold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eu2P2S6 exhibits excellent NLO properties, including a phase&#8208;matchable second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response &#8776;0.9&#215;AgGaS2@2.1&#8197;&#956;m, and a high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold of 3.4&#215;AgGaS2. Eu2P2S6 is the first NLO&#8208;active rare&#8208;earth&#8208;based chalcogenophosphate.







Abstract
Metal chalcogenophosphates are receiving increasing interest, specifically as promising infrared nonlinear optical (NLO) candidates. Here, a rare&#8208;earth chalcogenophosphate Eu2P2S6 crystallizing in the monoclinic noncentrosymmetric space group Pn was synthesized using a high&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state method. Its structure features isolated [P2S6]4&#8722; dimer, and two types of EuS8 bicapped triangular prisms. Eu2P2S6 exhibits a phase&#8208;matchable second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response &#8776;0.9&#215;AgGaS2@2.1&#8197;&#956;m, and high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold of 3.4&#215;AgGaS2, representing the first rare&#8208;earth NLO chalcogenophosphate. The theoretical calculation result suggests that the SHG response is ascribed to the synergetic contribution of [P2S6]4&#8722; dimers and EuS8 bicapped triangular prisms. This work provides not only a promising high&#8208;performance infrared NLO material, but also opens the avenue for exploring rare&#8208;earth chalcogenophosphates as potential IR NLO materials.

         <title>Reversible Insulator&#8211;Metal Transition by Chemical Doping and Dedoping of a Mott Insulator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical carrier doping of an x&#8208;LiPc molecular Mott insulator (Pc=phthalocyanine) induced an insulator&#8211;metal transition, and the obtained metallic x&#8208;LiPcI reverted to the pristine x&#8208;LiPc Mott insulator through dedoping iodine. The advent of the reversible insulator&#8211;metal transition by doping and dedoping of the molecular Mott insulator could lead to a new class of strongly correlated materials.







Abstract
The chemical carrier doping of molecular Mott insulators has been poorly investigated to date due to its difficulty. In this study, iodine doping of a molecular Mott insulator, lithium phthalocyanine crystallized in the x&#8208;form (x&#8208;LiPc), was performed to obtain metallic x&#8208;LiPcI. Crystal structure analysis revealed that iodine atoms penetrated channels of x&#8208;LiPc and formed one&#8208;dimensional chains. The Raman spectroscopy of x&#8208;LiPcI indicated the existence of linear I5&#8722;, demonstrating a transition from a half&#8208;filled band of the Mott insulating state to a 2/5&#8208;filled band of the metallic state. Electrical resistivity measurements confirmed the metallic nature of x&#8208;LiPcI, whereas a thermally activated behavior was observed for pristine x&#8208;LiPc. Furthermore, the x&#8208;LiPc Mott insulator was reproduced by dedoping iodine from x&#8208;LiPcI, suggesting that the electronic state can be reversibly tuned between the Mott insulating and metallic states by chemical doping and dedoping.

         <title>Origin of Red&#8208;Shifted Phosphorescence from Triphenylamines: Triplet Excimer or Impurity?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How much should triplet excimer phosphorescence shift in energy compared to that of the monomer? An original study on triphenylamine from more than 30&#8197;years ago showed a large shift of &gt;3000&#8197;cm&#8722;1, which is now debunked as new evidence suggests impurity phosphorescence interference. The purified aggregate phosphorescence shift is estimated to be &lt;200&#8197;cm&#8722;1.







Abstract
Triphenylamine (TPA) was reported to exhibit temperature&#8208;dependent dual phosphorescence, where the red&#8208;shifted band was assigned as the excimeric phosphorescence with an energy shift of &gt;3000&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (J. Phys. Chem. 1991, 95, 7189). Here we show that purified TPA (purity: &gt;99.97&#8201;%) shows a single phosphorescence band with a small energy shift of &lt;200&#8197;cm&#8722;1 under the same experimental conditions. The new experimental results, along with theoretical calculations, suggest that the previously reported triplet excimer of TPA is probably not valid and is most likely due to an unidentified impurity. As&#8208;received TPA samples, however, do exhibit temperature&#8208;dependent dual phosphorescence bands, and the wavelength, relative intensity, and temperature dependence of the lower&#8208;energy phosphorescence band vary significantly depending on dopant structures. It was found that dopant phosphorescence could still become dominant even in dilute third&#8208;party solutions of the host at low temperature.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroboration of Alkynes with Carboranes: Facile Construction of a Library of Boron Cluster&#8208;Based AIE&#8208;Active Luminogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration of alkynes with carboranes enables the construction of a library of boron cluster&#8208;based aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active luminogens. This work provides not only a general design principle for a new type of luminogens but also an efficient methodology to synthesize photo&#8208;functional boron cluster derivatives.







Abstract
The classical aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active luminogens (AIEgens) usually include two&#8208;dimensional aromatic systems such as tetraphenylethenes, which are synthesized in several steps by using toxic additives. Here, we proposed a new molecular design strategy for the realization of AIE properties by combining three&#8208;dimensional aromatic boron clusters of carboranes with vinyl group(s). To obtain a library of the boron cluster&#8208;based AIEgens, a Pd&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration of alkynes with carboranes is reported. This reaction protocol proceeds in one step under mild conditions with rapid reaction rate, excellent yields and regioselectivity. Photophysical property studies demonstrate that the facile molecular motions in solution can be inhibited in the solid state for these molecules, which leads to interesting AIE properties. This work provides not only a general design principle for AIEgens but also an efficient methodology to synthesize boron cluster&#8208;based photo&#8208;functional molecules.

         <title>Aminal&#8208;Linked Porphyrinic Covalent Organic Framework for Rapid Photocatalytic Decontamination of Mustard&#8208;Gas Simulant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel aminal&#8208;linked porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework (Por&#8208;Aminal&#8208;COF) was synthesized to detoxify the mustard&#8208;gas simulant 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES). Compared with imine&#8208;linked Por&#8208;COF, Por&#8208;Aminal&#8208;COF demonstrates higher photooxidation of CEES into 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfoxide (CEESO). The COF linkages contribute to an intersystem crossing process and enhance the photochemical properties of the catalyst.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are appealing photocatalysts for toxic chemical degradation. Great efforts have been devoted to regulate the photocatalytic performance of COFs by tuning their organic building blocks, but the relationship between COF linkage and photochemical properties has rarely been explored. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterisation of a novel aminal&#8208;linked porphyrinic COF, namely Por&#8208;Aminal&#8208;COF. Por&#8208;Aminal&#8208;COF (0.25&#8197;mol&#8201;%) showed excellent photocatalytic activity toward the detoxification of the sulfur mustard simulant with a half&#8208;life (t1/2) of 5&#8197;min, which is far lower than that of traditional imine&#8208;linked Por&#8208;COF (t1/2=16&#8197;min). Transient absorption spectroscopy indicated that the aminal linkages of Por&#8208;Aminal&#8208;COF facilitated the intersystem crossing process. Thus, Por&#8208;Aminal&#8208;COF showed higher triplet&#8208;state generation efficiency compared with Por&#8208;COF, consequently promoting the activation of oxygen molecular to singlet oxygen.

         <title>Effect of Surface&#8208;Adsorbed and Intercalated (Oxy)anions on the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As the kinetically demanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a key role in decarbonizing our society, a wide range of (pre)catalysts with various non&#8208;active site elements (e.g., Mo, S, Se, N, P, C, Si&#8230;) have been investigated. Thermodynamics dictate that these elements oxidize during industrial operation. The formed oxyanions are water soluble and thus predominantly leach in a reconstruction process. Nevertheless, recently, it was unveiled that these thermodynamically stable (oxy)anions can adsorb on the surface or intercalate in the interlayer space of the active catalyst. There, they tune the electronic properties of the active sites and can interact with the reaction intermediates changing the OER kinetics and potentially breaking the persisting OER *OH/*OOH scaling relations. Thus, the addition of (oxy)anions to the electrolyte opens a new design dimension for OER catalysis and the herein discussed observations deepen the understanding of the role of anions in the OER.</dc:description>

         <title>A Versatile Chemoenzymatic Nanoreactor that Mimics NAD(P)H Oxidase for the In Situ Regeneration of Cofactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a multifunctional chemoenzymatic nanoreactor (NanoNOx) for the glucose&#8208;controlled regeneration of natural and artificial nicotinamide cofactors. NanoNOx&#160;are built of glucose oxidase&#8211;polymer hybrids that assemble in the presence of an organometallic catalyst: hemin. The design of the hybrid is optimized to increase the effectiveness and the directional channeling at low substrate concentration. Importantly, NanoNOx can be reutilized without affecting the catalytic properties, can show high stability in the presence of organic solvents, and can effectively oxidize assorted natural and artificial enzyme cofactors. Finally, the hybrid was successfully coupled with NADH&#8208;dependent dehydrogenases in one&#8208;pot reactions, using a strategy based on the sequential injection of a fuel, namely, glucose. Hence, this study describes the first example of a hybrid chemoenzymatic nanomaterial able to efficiently mimic NOx enzymes in concurrent one&#8208;pot cascade reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Synthesis of Supramolecular Polymers: Finding the Right Conditions when Combining Covalent and Non&#8208;Covalent Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of covalent and non&#8208;covalent synthesis is omnipresent in nature and potentially enables access to new materials. Yet, the fundamental principles that govern such a synthesis are barely understood. Here, we demonstrate how even simple reaction mixtures behave surprisingly complex when covalent reactions are coupled to self&#8208;assembly processes. Specifically, we study the reaction behavior of a system in which the  in&#8208;situ  formation of discotic benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) monomers is linked to an intertwined non&#8208;covalent reaction network including self&#8208;assembly into helical BTA polymers. This system shows an unexpected phase&#8208;separation behavior in which an interplay of reactant/product concentrations, side&#8208;products and solvent purity determines the system composition. We envision that these insights can bring us one step closer to how to design the synthesis of systems in a combined covalent/non&#8208;covalent fashion.</dc:description>

         <title>The Synthetic Potential of Thiophenium Ylide Cycloadducts
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkynyl sulfides were shown to participate in thermal (3+2) cycloadditions with tethered alkynes. The resulting thiophenium ylide cycloadducts led to a variety of polysubstituted thiophenes by trapping with diverse electrophiles.







Abstract
(3+2) cycloaddition reactions are undeniably one of the most robust and versatile synthetic tools in heterocyclic chemistry. The classically required 1,3&#8208;dipoles are however limited to three&#8208;atom sequences bearing stabilized formal charges in their Lewis structure. The scope of three&#8208;atom groupings possible in (3+2) cycloadditions can be greatly expanded by taking of advantage neutral three&#8208;atom components (TACs). These groupings result in zwitterionic (3+2) cycloadducts adaptable to multiple outcomes depending on structure and conditions. Herein, the intramolecular (3+2) cycloaddition reaction between alkynyl sulfides (neutral TAC) and alkynes to provide key thiophenium ylide intermediates is first reported. These reactive species provide access to highly substituted fused thiophenes following predictable chemical sequences. Structural features on the obtained thiophenes were highly configurable by judicious choice of both alkynyl sulfide substitution and reaction conditions.
