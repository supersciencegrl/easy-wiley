         <title>Dopant&#8208;Free Hole Transport Materials Afford Efficient and Stable Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dopant&#8208;free D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type HTM named CI&#8208;TTIN&#8208;2F has been developed which showing excellent charge collection properties and multisite defect&#8208;healing effects. All&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3 PSCs with CI&#8208;TTIN&#8208;2F HTM feature high efficiencies up to 15.9&#8201;%, along with 86&#8201;% efficiency retention after 1000&#8197;h under ambient conditions. All&#8208;inorganic perovskite solar modules were also fabricated that exhibiting an efficiency of 11.0&#8201;% with a record area of 27&#8197;cm2.







Abstract
The emerging CsPbI3 perovskites are highly efficient and thermally stable materials for wide&#8208;band gap perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but the doped hole transport materials (HTMs) accelerate the undesirable phase transition of CsPbI3 in ambient. Herein, a dopant&#8208;free D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type HTM named CI&#8208;TTIN&#8208;2F has been developed which overcomes this problem. The suitable optoelectronic properties and energy&#8208;level alignment endow CI&#8208;TTIN&#8208;2F with excellent charge collection properties. Moreover, CI&#8208;TTIN&#8208;2F provides multisite defect&#8208;healing effects on the defective sites of CsPbI3 surface. Inorganic CsPbI3 PSCs with CI&#8208;TTIN&#8208;2F HTM feature high efficiencies up to 15.9&#8201;%, along with 86&#8201;% efficiency retention after 1000&#8197;h under ambient conditions. Inorganic perovskite solar modules were also fabricated that exhibiting an efficiency of 11.0&#8201;% with a record area of 27&#8197;cm2. This work confirms that using efficient dopant&#8208;free HTMs is an attractive strategy to stabilize inorganic PSCs for their future scale&#8208;up.

         <title>Bridge Functionalisation of Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarises the known chemistry for the preparation of bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) derivatives reported up to mid&#8208;2021. Bridge substitution on BCP derivatives often provides patent&#8208;free, novel vectors for substituent disposition in drug discovery and materials science; this capacity may prove to be transformational in the coming years.







Abstract
&#8220;Escaping from flatland&#8221;, by increasing the saturation level and three&#8208;dimensionality of drug&#8208;like compounds, can enhance their potency, selectivity and pharmacokinetic profile. One approach that has attracted considerable recent attention is the bioisosteric replacement of aromatic rings, internal alkynes and tert&#8208;butyl groups with bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) units. While functionalisation of the tertiary bridgehead positions of BCP derivatives is well&#8208;documented, functionalisation of the three concyclic secondary bridge positions remains an emerging field. The unique properties of the BCP core present considerable synthetic challenges to the development of such transformations. However, the bridge positions provide novel vectors for drug discovery and applications in materials science, providing entry to novel chemical and intellectual property space. This Minireview aims to consolidate the major advances in the field, serving as a useful reference to guide further work that is expected in the coming years.

         <title>Cooperative Effects in Switchable Catalysis: Enhancing Double&#8208;Click Reaction Yield of Symmetrical Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Like an eagle spreading its wings wide, the closed structure opens its hidden catalytic sites upon addition of an iron trigger thus furnishing a cavity for a double&#8208;click conversion toward rotaxanes. Surprisingly, a close distance match is not needed for double activation.







Abstract
Reversible switching between the closed cyclic dimeric assembly [Cu2(1)2]2+ (OFF state) and the extended dimeric homoleptic complex [FeCu2(1)2]4+ (ON State) by addition/removal of Fe2+ triggered catalysis of a double&#8208;click reaction and high yield preparation of [2]rotaxanes. Mechanistic and computational studies provide valuable general insight for double&#8208;click strategies by revealing cooperative effects in the second cycloaddition step due to a distance&#8208;tolerant preorganization of the first&#8208;click product by the two copper(I)&#8208;loaded phenanthroline subunits of [FeCu2(1)2]4+.

         <title>Modulating the Efficacy of Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors through Fluorine Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorination can have important beneficial effects in biologically active molecules, but these effects can sometimes be difficult to predict. Using the vast amount of data obtained on selective, fluorinated inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase, this Minireview attempts to give general guidelines on how to wisely insert fluorine atoms within an inhibitor moiety to precisely enhance or disrupt ligand&#8211;protein interactions.







Abstract
The insertion of fluorine atoms and/or fluoroalkyl groups can lead to many beneficial effects in biologically active molecules, such as enhanced metabolic stability, bioavailability, lipophilicity, and membrane permeability, as well as a strengthening of protein&#8211;ligand binding interactions. However, this &#8220;magic effect&#8221; of fluorine atom(s) insertion can often be meaningless. Taking advantage of the wide range of data coming from the quest for carbonic anhydrase (CA) fluorinated inhibitors, this Minireview attempts to give &#8220;general guidelines&#8221; on how to wisely insert fluorine atom(s) within an inhibitor moiety to precisely enhance or disrupt ligand&#8211;protein interactions, depending on the target location of the fluorine substitution in the ligand. Multiple approaches such as ITC, kinetic and inhibition studies, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and NMR spectroscopy are useful in dissecting single binding contributions to the overall observed effect. The exploitation of innovative directions made in the field of protein and ligand&#8208;based fluorine NMR screening is also discussed to avoid misconduct and finely tune the exploitation of selective fluorine atom insertion in the future.

         <title>Non&#8208;invasive Regulation of Cellular Morphology Using a Photoswitchable Mechanical DNA Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We created a photoswitchable DNA polymer containing azobenzene moieties and dynamically regulated the spatial distance between adhesion peptides with photoirradiation. Using the mechanical properties of this DNA polymer, UV and visible light irradiation induced a significant morphology change of the cells. This study presents a general strategy to explore nanoscale interactions between stem cells and stimuli&#8208;responsive DNA nanostructures.







Abstract
The extracellular matrix (ECM) in which the cells reside provides a dynamic and reversible environment. Spatiotemporal cues are essential when cells are undergoing morphogenesis, repair and differentiation. Emulation of such an intricate system with reversible presentation of nanoscale cues can help us better understand cellular processes and can allow the precise manipulation of cell function in&#8197;vitro. Herein, we formulated a photoswitchable DNA mechanical nanostructure containing azobenzene moieties and dynamically regulated the spatial distance between adhesion peptides using a photoswitchable DNA polymer with photoirradiation. We found that the DNA polymer reversibly forms two different structures, a relaxed linear and shrunken compact form, observed by AFM. Using the mechanical properties of this DNA polymer, UV and visible light irradiation induced a significant morphology change of the cells between a round shape and spindle shape, thus providing a tool to decipher the language of the ECM better.

         <title>Activation of Aryl Carboxylic Acids by Diboron Reagents towards Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Decarbonylative Borylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni&#8208;catalyzed direct decarbonylative borylation of aryl carboxylic acids with B2cat2 has been established. B2cat2 serves as a borylating agent, but also activates the carboxylic acid substrate towards decarbonylative coupling, playing a dual role in this reaction. A combination of experimental and computational studies reveals that the reaction proceeds through a hitherto unknown concerted decarbonylation and reductive elimination step.







Abstract
The Ni&#8208;catalyzed decarbonylative borylation of (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids with B2cat2 has been achieved without recourse to any additives. This Ni&#8208;catalyzed method exhibits a broad substrate scope covering poorly reactive non&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids, and tolerates diverse functional groups including some of the groups active to Ni0 catalysts. The key to achieve this decarbonylative borylation reaction is the choice of B2cat2 as a coupling partner that not only acts as a borylating reagent, but also chemoselectively activates aryl carboxylic acids towards oxidative addition of their C(acyl)&#8722;O bond to Ni0 catalyst via the formation of acyloxyboron compounds. A combination of experimental and computational studies reveals a detailed plausible mechanism for this reaction system, which involves a hitherto unknown concerted decarbonylation and reductive elimination step that generates the aryl boronic ester product. This mode of boron&#8208;promoted carboxylic acid activation is also applicable to other types of reactions.

         <title>Direct Amidation&#160;of Esters via Ball Milling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct mechanochemical amidation of esters &#8211; enabled by ball&#8208;milling &#8211; is herein described. The operationally simple procedure requires inputs of ester, amine, and sub&#8208;stoichiometric KOtBu and is applicable to a preparation of a large and diverse library of 78 amide structures with modest to excellent efficiency. Heteroaromatic and heterocyclic components are specifically shown to be amenable to this mechanochemical protocol. This direct synthesis platform has been applied to the synthesis of API&#8217;s, agrochemicals, and its ability to deliver gram&#8208;scale synthesis of active pharmaceuticals and building blocks is demonstrated, all in the absence of a reaction solvent.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrodeposition of Zinc onto Au(111) and Au(100) from the Ionic Liquid [MPPip][TFSI]</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The differences of the electrochemical deposition of Zn onto Au(111) and Au(100) from the ionic liquid N&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;propylpiperidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide are presented. The clearly different structures of the deposits on both gold single crystal electrodes reveal a strong influence of the crystallographic orientation on the metal deposition of zinc.







Abstract
The improvement of rechargeable zinc/air batteries was a hot topic in recent years. Predominantly, the influence of water and additives on the structure of the Zn deposit and the possible dendrite formation were studied. However, the effect of the surface structure of the underlying substrate was not focused on in detail, yet. We now show the differences in electrochemical deposition of Zn onto Au(111) and Au(100) from the ionic liquid N&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;propylpiperidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide. The fundamental processes were initially characterized via cyclic voltammetry and in situ scanning tunnelling microscopy. Bulk deposits were then examined using Auger electron spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Different structures of Zn deposits are observed during the initial stages of electrocrystallisation on both electrodes, which reveals the strong influence of the crystallographic orientation on the metal deposition of zinc on gold.

         <title>Molecular Engineering on MoS2 Enables Large Interlayers and Unlocked Basal Planes for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In&#8208;situ molecular engineering of structure defect manufacturing and O&#8208;doping unlocks the MoS2 basal plane and simultaneously upgrades its interlayer spacing (from 6.2 to 9.6&#8197;&#197;), hydrophilicity, and electrical conductivity. These merits enable highly efficient 3D Zn&#8208;ion transport in the MoS2 lattice along both the ab plane and c&#8208;axis, thus rendering the fast reaction kinetics and the exceptional rate performance in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;storage behaviors of MoS2&#8208;based cathodes mainly rely on the ion&#8208;(de)intercalation at edge sites but are limited by the inactive basal plane. Herein, an in&#8208;situ molecular engineering strategy in terms of structure defects manufacturing and O&#8208;doping is proposed for MoS2 (designated as D&#8208;MoS2&#8208;O) to unlock the inert basal plane, expand the interlayer spacing (from 6.2 to 9.6&#8197;&#197;), and produce abundant 1T&#8208;phase. The tailored D&#8208;MoS2&#8208;O with excellent hydrophilicity and high conductivity allows the 3D Zn2+ transport along both the ab plane and c&#8208;axis, thus achieving the exceptional high rate capability. Zn2+ diffusion through the basal plane is verified by DFT computations.

     alt="Molecular Engineering on MoS2 Enables Large Interlayers and Unlocked Basal Planes for High-Performance Aqueous Zn-Ion Storage"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In-situ molecular engineering of structure defect manufacturing and O-doping unlocks the MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; basal plane and simultaneously upgrades its interlayer spacing (from 6.2 to 9.6&#8197;&#197;), hydrophilicity, and electrical conductivity. These merits enable highly efficient 3D Zn-ion transport in the MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lattice along both the &lt;i&gt;ab&lt;/i&gt; plane and &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-axis, thus rendering the fast reaction kinetics and the exceptional rate performance in aqueous Zn-ion batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous Zn-storage behaviors of MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based cathodes mainly rely on the ion-(de)intercalation at edge sites but are limited by the inactive basal plane. Herein, an in-situ molecular engineering strategy in terms of structure defects manufacturing and O-doping is proposed for MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (designated as D-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-O) to unlock the inert basal plane, expand the interlayer spacing (from 6.2 to 9.6&#8197;&#197;), and produce abundant 1T-phase. The tailored D-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-O with excellent hydrophilicity and high conductivity allows the 3D Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transport along both the &lt;i&gt;ab&lt;/i&gt; plane and &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-axis, thus achieving the exceptional high rate capability. Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion through the basal plane is verified by DFT computations. As a proof of concept, the wearable quasi-solid-state rechargeable Zn battery employing the D-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-O cathode operates stably even under severe bending conditions, showing great application prospects. This work opens a new window for designing high-performance layered cathode materials for aqueous Zn-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Solid&#8208;Phase Peptide Macrocyclization and Multifunctionalization via Dipyrrin Construction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and highly efficient synthetic protocol towards multifunctional fluorescent cyclopeptides by solid&#8208;phase peptide macrocyclization via dipyrrin staple construction is introduced, where the dipyrrin moiety serves as a novel multifunctional staple linker for targeted protein imaging and selective metal sensing.







Abstract
We introduce a new and highly efficient synthetic protocol towards multifunctional fluorescent cyclopeptides by solid&#8208;phase peptide macrocyclization via dipyrrin construction, with full scope of proteinogenic amino acids and different ring sizes. Various bicyclic peptides can be created by dipyrrin&#8208;based crosslinking and double dipyrrin&#8208;ring formation. The embedded dipyrrin can be either transformed to fluorescent BODIPY and then utilized as cancer&#8208;selective targeted protein imaging probe in vitro, or directly employed as a selective metal sensor in aqueous media. This work provides a valuable addition to the peptide macrocyclization toolbox, and a blueprint for the development of multifunctional dipyrrin linkers in cyclopeptides for a wide range of potential bioapplications.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Oscillating Actuators with Phototactic Locomotion Based on Black Phosphorus Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of photoacutator based on a heterostructured black phosphorus (BP)&#8208;carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrid presents high&#8208;performance light&#8208;driven reversible actuation. By using the BP&#8208;based actuator as the working unit, together with the self&#8208;oscillating configuration and asymmetric structure design, an inchworm&#8208;like soft actuator that can crawl autonomously towards the light source is constructed.







Abstract
Developing self&#8208;oscillating soft actuators that enable autonomous, continuous, and directional locomotion is significant in biomimetic soft robotics fields, but remains great challenging. Here, an untethered soft photoactuators based on covalently&#8208;bridged black phosphorus&#8208;carbon nanotubes heterostructure with self&#8208;oscillation and phototactic locomotion under constant light irradiation is designed. Owing to the good photothermal effect of black phosphorus heterostructure and thermal deformation of the actuator components, the new actuator assembled by heterostructured black phosphorus, polymer and paper produces light&#8208;driven reversible deformation with fast and large response. By using this actuator as mechanical power and designing a robot configuration with self&#8208;feedback loop to generate self&#8208;oscillation, an inchworm&#8208;like actuator that can crawl autonomously towards the light source is constructed. Moreover, due to the anisotropy and tailorability of the actuator, an artificial crab robot that can simulate the sideways locomotion of crabs and simultaneously change color under light irradiation is also realized.

         <title>A Covalent Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Superlattice Covered with Organic Functional Groups for Highly Sensitive and Selective Gas Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalent organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid superlattice was designed and synthesized with a facile coordination assembly method. The surface functional groups and interlayer charge transport render the superlattice nanosheets an excellent gas sensing material with the highest sensitivity, the lowest detection limit, and exceptional selectivity towards NO2 at room temperature among all fast&#8208;response gas&#8208;sensing materials without the need of light assistance.







Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid superlattices (OIHSLs) hold attractive physical and chemical properties, while the construction of single&#8208;crystal covalent OIHSLs has not been achieved. Herein a coordination assembly strategy was proposed to create a single&#8208;crystal covalent OIHSL PbBDT (BDT=1,4&#8208;benzenedithiolate), where layered [PbS2] sublattice covalently connects with benzene sublattice. The covalent bonding offers better thermo&#8208;/chemi&#8208;stability, inter&#8208;sublattice electron transport, and unique organic&#8208;group&#8208;functionalized surface, which may enable better performances in chemical applications than non&#8208;covalent OIHSL. These features endow PbBDT with the highest sensitivity, the lowest detection limit and excellent selectivity towards NO2 at room temperature among all chemiresistive gas&#8208;sensing materials with reported response time less than 2&#8197;min without the need of light assistance.

         <title>Twofold C&#8722;H Activation&#8208;Based Enantio&#8208; and Diastereoselective C&#8722;H Arylation Using Diarylacetylenes as Rare Arylating Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed 1:2 coupling of phosphinamides and diarylacetylenes has been realized for enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective synthesis of axially chiral biaryls bearing a P&#8208;stereogenic center. The reaction proceeded via twofold C&#8722;H bond activation, with the alkynes being an arylating reagent.







Abstract
C&#8722;H bond activation has been established as an attractive strategy to access axially chiral biaryls, and the most straightforward method is direct C&#8722;H arylation of arenes. However, the arylating source has been limited to several classes of reactive and bulky reagents. Reported herein is rhodium&#8208;catalyzed 1:2 coupling of diarylphosphinic amides and diarylacetylenes for enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective construction of biaryls with both central and axial chirality. This twofold C&#8722;H activation reaction stays contrast to the previously explored Miura&#8211;Satoh type 1:2 coupling of arenes and alkynes in terms of chemoselectivity and proceeded under mild conditions with the alkyne acting as a rare arylating reagent. Both C&#8722;H activation events are stereo&#8208;determining and are under catalyst control, with the 2nd C&#8722;H activation being diastereo&#8208;determining in a remote fashion. Analysis of the stereochemistry of the major and side products suggests moderate enantioselectivity of the initial C&#8722;H activation&#8211;desymmetrization process. However, the minor (R) rhodium vinyl intermediate is consumed more readily in undesired protonolysis, eventually resulting in high enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity of the major product.

         <title>A Boratafulvene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first boratafulvene was accessed by deprotonation of a B&#8208;methyl borole. The boratafulvene is a new C&#8208;nucleophilic synthon for substituted boroles and reacts with carbonyls in a bora&#8208;Wittig&#8208;type reaction transferring the methylene group.







Abstract
Structurally authenticated free B&#8208;alkyl boroles are presented and electronic implications of alkyl substitution were assessed. Deprotonation of a boron&#8208;bound exocyclic methyl group in a B&#8208;methyl borole yields the first 5&#8208;boratafulvene anion&#8212;an isomer to boratabenzene. Boratafulvene was structurally characterized and its electronic structure probed by DFT calculations. The pKa value of the exocyclic B&#8722;CH3 in a set of boroles was computationally approximated and confirmed a pronounced acidic character caused by the boron atom embedded in an anti&#8208;aromatic moiety. The non&#8208;aromatic boratafulvene reacts as a C&#8208;centered nucleophile with the mild electrophile Me3SnCl to give a stannylmethyl borole, regenerating the anti&#8208;aromaticity. As nucleophilic synthons for boroles, boratafulvenes thus open an entirely new avenue for synthetic strategies toward this highly reactive class of heterocycles. Boratafulvene reacts as a methylene transfer reagent in a bora&#8208;Wittig&#8208;type reaction generating a borole oxide.

     alt="A Boratafulvene"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first boratafulvene was accessed by deprotonation of a B-methyl borole. The boratafulvene is a new C-nucleophilic synthon for substituted boroles and reacts with carbonyls in a bora-Wittig-type reaction transferring the methylene group.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structurally authenticated free B-alkyl boroles are presented and electronic implications of alkyl substitution were assessed. Deprotonation of a boron-bound exocyclic methyl group in a B-methyl borole yields the first 5-boratafulvene anion&#8212;an isomer to boratabenzene. Boratafulvene was structurally characterized and its electronic structure probed by DFT calculations. The p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; value of the exocyclic B&#8722;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in a set of boroles was computationally approximated and confirmed a pronounced acidic character caused by the boron atom embedded in an anti-aromatic moiety. The non-aromatic boratafulvene reacts as a C-centered nucleophile with the mild electrophile Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SnCl to give a stannylmethyl borole, regenerating the anti-aromaticity. As nucleophilic synthons for boroles, boratafulvenes thus open an entirely new avenue for synthetic strategies toward this highly reactive class of heterocycles. Boratafulvene reacts as a methylene transfer reagent in a bora-Wittig-type reaction generating a borole oxide.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Electrophilic Aminating Agents in Total Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review outlines the strategic use of electrophilic aminating agents in total synthesis. A wide range of C&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming methods are highlighted, including polar, radical and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed processes.







Abstract
Classical amination methods involve the reaction of a nitrogen nucleophile with an electrophilic carbon center; however, in recent years, umpoled strategies have gained traction where the nitrogen source acts as an electrophile. A wide range of electrophilic aminating agents are now available, and these underpin a range of powerful C&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming processes. In this Review, we highlight the strategic use of electrophilic aminating agents in total synthesis.

         <title>Red&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Photoredox Catalysis Enables Self&#8208;Reporting Nitric Oxide Release for Efficient Antibacterial Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Red&#8208;light&#8208;mediated photoredox catalysis for self&#8208;reporting nitric oxide release is reported in the presence of palladium(II) tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrin. The NO&#8208;releasing platform eradicates Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm in&#8197;vitro and treats bacterial infection in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Nitric oxide (NO) serves as a key regulator of many physiological processes and as a potent therapeutic agent. The local delivery of NO is important to achieve target therapeutic outcomes due to the toxicity of NO at high concentrations. Although light stimulus represents a non&#8208;invasive tool with spatiotemporal precision to mediate NO release, many photoresponsive NO&#8208;releasing molecules can only respond to ultraviolet (UV) or near&#8208;UV visible light with low penetration and high phototoxicity. We report that coumarin&#8208;based NO donors with maximal absorbances at 328&#8197;nm can be activated under (deep) red&#8208;light (630 or 700&#8197;nm) irradiation in the presence of palladium(II) tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrin, enabling stoichiometric and self&#8208;reporting NO release with a photolysis quantum yield of 8&#8201;% via photoredox catalysis. This NO&#8208;releasing platform with ciprofloxacin loading can eradicate Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm in&#8197;vitro and treat cutaneous abscesses in&#8197;vivo.

         <title>Discrete Self&#8208;Assembled Metallo&#8208;Foldamers with Heteroleptic Sequence Specificity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A turn for the better: ligands with orthogonal binding&#8208;site pairings allow the self&#8208;assembly of discrete heteroleptic PdII&#8208;containing sequences. These adopt persistent conformations in solution, allowing &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; metallo&#8208;foldamer formation under thermodynamic control.







Abstract
Discrete and structurally diverse foldamer sequences are constructed in both natural and abiotic systems primarily using inert connectivity with irreversible organic covalent bonds, serving to preserve the identity of the sequence. The formation of sequences under thermodynamic control using labile coordination bonds would be attractive for synthetic ease and modular capability, but this presents issues regarding sequence preservation. Here is presented an approach integrating palladium(II) metal ions into the sequence itself, with fidelity maintained through use of complementary pairings of ligand arrangements at the metal centre. This is accomplished using sites of different denticity and/or hydrogen bonding capability. In this fashion, discrete and ordered metallo&#8208;sequences are formed as thermodynamic products in a single step, and these then fold into defined conformations due to &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between electron&#8208;rich and &#8208;poor aromatic regions of the combined componentry.

         <title>Synergistical Dipole&#8211;Dipole Interaction Induced Self&#8208;Assembly of Phenoxazine&#8208;Based Hole&#8208;Transporting Materials for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
Dipole&#8211;dipole interaction induced self&#8208;assembly of phenoxazine&#8208;based hole&#8208;transporting material, N01, is achieved by introducing a hexyl bromide side&#8208;chain to tune its self&#8208;assembling properties. N01 exhibits a higher intrinsic hole mobility and more favorable interfacial properties for hole transport, extraction and perovskite growth, with a conversion efficiency of 21.85&#8201;% to be realized in an inverted PSC.







Abstract
Delicately designed dopant&#8208;free hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) with ordered structure have become one of the major strategies to achieve high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, we report two donor&#8208;&#960; linker&#8208;donor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D) HTMs, N01 and N02, which consist of facilely synthesized 4,8&#8208;di(n&#8208;hexyloxy)&#8208;benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene as a &#960; linker, with 10&#8208;bromohexyl&#8208;10H&#8208;phenoxazine and 10&#8208;hexyl&#8208;10H&#8208;phenoxazine as donors, respectively. The N01 molecules form a two&#8208;dimensional conjugated network governed by C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br interaction between phenoxazine donors, and synchronously construct a three&#8208;dimension lamellar structure with the aid of interlaminar &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction. Consequently, N01 as a dopant&#8208;free small&#8208;molecule HTM exhibits a higher intrinsic hole mobility and more favorable interfacial properties for hole transport, hole extraction and perovskite growth, enabling an inverted PSC to achieve a very impressive power conversion efficiency of 21.85&#8201;%.

         <title>Photoinduced Charge Separation Prompted Intervalence Charge Transfer in a Bis(thienyl)diketopyrrolopyrrole Bridged Donor&#8208;TCBD Push&#8208;Pull System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Occurrence of intervalence charge transfer in a newly synthesized multi&#8208;modular donor&#8211;acceptor system comprised of central bis(thienyl) diketopyrrolopyrrole hosting two phenothiazine&#8208;tetracyanobutadiene entities on the opposite sides is demonstrated. The near&#8208;infrared IVCT band has been used as a diagnostic marker to probe photoinduced electron transfer.







Abstract
Intervalence charge transfer (IVCT), a phenomenon observed in molecular systems comprised of two redox centers differing in oxidation states by one unit, is reported in a novel, newly synthesized, multi&#8208;modular donor&#8208;acceptor system comprised of central bis(thienyl)diketopyrrolopyrrole (TDPP) hosting two phenothiazine&#8208;tetracyanobutadiene (PTZ&#8208;TCBD) entities on the opposite sides. One&#8208;electron reduction of TCBD promoted electron exchange between the two TCBD resulting in IVCT transition in the near&#8208;infrared region. The stabilization energy, &#8722;&#916;Gcom and comproportionation equilibrium constant, Kcom calculated from peak potentials of the split reduction waves were found to be 1.06&#215;104&#8197;J&#8201;mol&#8722;1, and 72.3&#8197;M&#8722;1, respectively. Further, the IVCT transition was also witnessed during the process of thermodynamically feasible electron transfer upon excitation of the TDPP entity in the system, and served as a diagnostic marker to characterize the electron transfer product. Subsequent transient absorption spectral studies and data analysis by Global and Target analyses revealed occurrence of ultrafast charge separation (kcs&#8776;1010&#8197;s&#8722;1) owing to the close proximity and good communication between the entities of the multi&#8208;modular donor&#8208;acceptor system. The role of central TDPP in promoting IVCT is borne out from the present investigation.

&lt;p&gt;Occurrence of intervalence charge transfer in a newly synthesized multi-modular donor&#8211;acceptor system comprised of central bis(thienyl) diketopyrrolopyrrole hosting two phenothiazine-tetracyanobutadiene entities on the opposite sides is demonstrated. The near-infrared IVCT band has been used as a diagnostic marker to probe photoinduced electron transfer.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intervalence charge transfer (IVCT), a phenomenon observed in molecular systems comprised of two redox centers differing in oxidation states by one unit, is reported in a novel, newly synthesized, multi-modular donor-acceptor system comprised of central bis(thienyl)diketopyrrolopyrrole (TDPP) hosting two phenothiazine-tetracyanobutadiene (PTZ-TCBD) entities on the opposite sides. One-electron reduction of TCBD promoted electron exchange between the two TCBD resulting in IVCT transition in the near-infrared region. The stabilization energy, &#8722;&#916;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;com&lt;/sub&gt; and comproportionation equilibrium constant, &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;com&lt;/sub&gt; calculated from peak potentials of the split reduction waves were found to be 1.06&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;J&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and 72.3&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Further, the IVCT transition was also witnessed during the process of thermodynamically feasible electron transfer upon excitation of the TDPP entity in the system, and served as a diagnostic marker to characterize the electron transfer product. Subsequent transient absorption spectral studies and data analysis by Global and Target analyses revealed occurrence of ultrafast charge separation (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;cs&lt;/sub&gt;&#8776;10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) owing to the close proximity and good communication between the entities of the multi-modular donor-acceptor system. The role of central TDPP in promoting IVCT is borne out from the present investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Robust and Versatile Coatings Engineered via Simultaneous Covalent and Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfacial assemblies are spontaneously formed on various substrates in aqueous conditions via simultaneous covalent and noncovalent interactions using tannic acid and the small aromatic molecule benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiol. The robust and colorless coatings enable the subsequent on&#8208;surface synthesis or modification for the development of various multifunctional coatings and nanosystems.







Abstract
Interfacial modular assembly has emerged as an adaptable strategy for engineering the surface properties of substrates in biomedicine, photonics, and catalysis. Herein, we report a versatile and robust coating (pBDT&#8208;TA), self&#8208;assembled from tannic acid (TA) and a self&#8208;polymerizing aromatic dithiol (i.e., benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiol, BDT), that can be engineered on diverse substrates with a precisely tuned thickness (5&#8211;40&#8197;nm) by varying the concentration of BDT used. The pBDT&#8208;TA coating is stabilized by covalent (disulfide) bonds and supramolecular (&#960;&#8208;&#960;) interactions, endowing the coating with high stability in various harsh aqueous environments across ionic strength, pH, temperature (e.g., 100&#8197;mM NaCl, HCl (pH&#8197;1) or NaOH (pH&#8197;13), and water at 100&#8201;&#176;C), as well as surfactant solution (e.g., 100&#8197;mM Triton X&#8208;100) and biological buffer (e.g., Dulbecco's phosphate&#8208;buffered saline), as validated by experiments and simulations. Moreover, the reported pBDT&#8208;TA coating enables secondary reactions on the coating for engineering hybrid adlayers (e.g., ZIF&#8208;8 shells) via phenolic&#8208;mediated adhesion, and the facile integration of aromatic fluorescent dyes (e.g., rhodamine B) via &#960; interactions without requiring elaborate synthetic processes.

         <title>Porphyrinic MOF Film for Multifaceted Electrochemical Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integration of a porphyrinic metal&#8211;organic framework on a conductive indium tin oxide surface affords an electrochemical sensor, Mn&#8208;PCN&#8208;222/ITO. Thanks to detecting several inorganic ions, organic hazardous substances and pollutants, Mn&#8208;PCN&#8208;222/ITO demonstrates multifaceted sensing with low detection limits. Benchmark sensing performances are set not only across several single components, but also in the corresponding binary and ternary mixtures.







Abstract
Electrochemical sensors are indispensable in clinical diagnosis, biochemical detection and environmental monitoring, thanks to their ability to detect analytes in real&#8208;time with direct electronic readout. However, electrochemical sensors are challenged by sensitivity&#8212;the need to detect low concentrations, and selectivity&#8212;to detect specific analytes in multicomponent systems. Herein, a porphyrinic metal&#8208;organic framework (PP&#8208;MOF), Mn&#8208;PCN&#8208;222 is deposited on a conductive indium tin oxide (ITO) surface. It affords Mn&#8208;PCN&#8208;222/ITO, a versatile voltammetric sensor able to detect redox&#8208;active analytes such as inorganic ions, organic hazardous substances and pollutants, including nitroaromatics, phenolic and quinone&#8208;hydroquinone toxins, heavy metal ions, biological species, as well as azo dyes. As a working electrode, the high surface area of Mn&#8208;PCN&#8208;222/ITO enables high currents, and therefore leverages highly sensitive analysis. The metalloporphyrin centre facilitates analyte&#8208;specific redox catalysis to simultaneously detect more than one analyte in binary and ternary systems allowing for detection of a wide array of trace pollutants under real&#8208;world conditions, most with high sensitivity.

         <title>Activating Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence of Organic Luminophores via External Heavy&#8208;Atom Effect and Rigidity of Ionic Polymer Matrix**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A doping strategy to directly transform commercial fluorescent dyes to pure organic, amorphous phosphorescent materials is developed via a single ionic polymer. The external heavy&#8208;atom effect generates the triplet states, while the rigid ionic bonding matrix inhibits the nonradiative decay. This general strategy provides a method to activate room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and a powerful tool for studying triplet states.







Abstract
Pure organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have attracted wide attention for their easy preparation, low toxicity, and applications in various fields like bioimaging and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Developing phosphorescent systems with more universality and less difficulty in synthesis has long been the pursuit of materials scientists. By employing a polymeric quaternary ammonium salt with an ionic bonding matrix and heavy atoms, commercial fluorescent dyes are directly endowed with phosphorescence emission. In a single amorphous polymer, the external heavy&#8208;atom effect generates excited triplet states and the rigid polymer matrix stabilizes them. This study put forward a new general strategy to design and develop pure organic RTP materials starting from existing library of organic dyes without complicated chemical synthesis.

         <title>Reversible Ligand Exchange in Atomically Dispersed Catalysts for Modulating the Activity and Selectivity of the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination environments of atomically dispersed catalysts are important for their catalytic performances. We report the reversible control of the metal coordination environment in atomically dispersed electrocatalysts via simple ligand exchange reactions, which could reversibly modulate the catalytic reactivity of the oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
Rational control of the coordination environment of atomically dispersed catalysts is pivotal to achieve desirable catalytic reactivity. We report the reversible control of coordination structure in atomically dispersed electrocatalysts via ligand exchange reactions to reversibly modulate their reactivity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The CO&#8208;ligated atomically dispersed Rh catalyst exhibited ca. 30&#8208;fold higher ORR activity than the NHx&#8208;ligated catalyst, whereas the latter showed three times higher H2O2 selectivity than the former. Post&#8208;treatments of the catalysts with CO or NH3 allowed the reversible exchange of CO and NHx ligands, which reversibly tuned oxidation state of metal centers and their ORR activity and selectivity. DFT calculations revealed that more reduced oxidation state of CO&#8208;ligated Rh site could further stabilize the *OOH intermediate, facilitating the two&#8208; and four&#8208;electron pathway ORR. The reversible ligand exchange reactions were generalized to Ir&#8208; and Pt&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Identification of M&#8208;NH2&#8208;NH2 Intermediate and Rate Determining Step for Nitrogen Reduction with Bioinspired Sulfur&#8208;Bonded FeW Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by biological nitrogenases, a bimetallic sulfide material (FeWSx@FeWO4) was synthesized for a highly efficient N2 reduction (NRR) catalyst. In&#8197;situ Raman spectra and hydrazine reduction kinetics analysis revealed that the reduction of undissociated hydrazine intermediates (M&#8208;NH2&#8208;NH2) on the surface of catalyst is the rate&#8208;determing step for the NRR process.







Abstract
The multimetallic sulfur&#8208;framework catalytic site of biological nitrogenases allows the efficient conversion of dinitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH3) under ambient conditions. Inspired by biological nitrogenases, a bimetallic sulfide material (FeWSx@FeWO4) was synthesized as a highly efficient N2 reduction (NRR) catalyst by sulfur substitution of the surface of FeWO4 nanoparticles. Thus prepared FeWSx@FeWO4 catalysts exhibit a relatively high NH3 production rate of 30.2&#8197;ug&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1cat and a Faraday efficiency of 16.4&#8201;% at &#8722;0.45&#8197;V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode in a flow cell; these results have been confirmed via purified 15N2&#8208;isotopic labeling experiments. In situ Raman spectra and hydrazine reduction kinetics analysis revealed that the reduction of undissociated hydrazine intermediates (M&#8208;NH2&#8208;NH2) on the surface of the bimetallic sulfide catalyst is the rate&#8208;determing step for the NRR process. Therefore, this work can provide guidance for elucidating the structure&#8211;activity relationship of NRR catalysts.

         <title>Noncovalently Functionalized Commodity Polymers as Tailor&#8208;Made Additives for Stereoselective Crystallization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular strategy to fabricate &#8220;tailor&#8208;made&#8221; polymeric additives by attaching chiral small molecules onto achiral commodity polymers through non&#8208;covalent interactions is developed. These supramolecular additives were used in the stereoselective crystallization of various racemates and yielded enantiopure crystals with opposite configurations to the chiral moieties.







Abstract
Stereoselective inhibition of the nucleation and crystal growth of one enantiomer aided by &#8220;tailor&#8208;made&#8221; polymeric additives is an efficient method to obtain enantiopure compounds. However, the conventional preparation of polymeric additives from chiral monomers are laborious and limited in structures, which impedes their rapid optimization and applicability. Herein, we report a &#8220;plug&#8208;and&#8208;play&#8221; strategy to facilitate synthesis by using commercially available achiral polymers as the platform to attach various chiral small molecules as the recognition side&#8208;chains through non&#8208;covalent interactions. A library of supramolecular polymers made up of two vinyl polymers and six small molecules were applied with seeds in the selective crystallization of seven racemates in different solvents. They showed good to excellent stereoselectivity in yielding crystals with high enantiomeric purities in conglomerates and racemic compound forming systems. This convenient, low&#8208;cost modular synthesis strategy of polymeric additives will allow for high&#8208;efficient, economical resolution of various racemates on different scales.

         <title>Multistage Stimulus&#8208;Responsive Room Temperature Phosphorescence Based on Host&#8211;Guest Doping Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of different conjugation degrees on the quantum yield and lifetime of room temperature phosphorescence in a host&#8211;guest system is discussed. Multistage stimulus&#8208;responsive RTP characteristics from grinding to chemical stimulus were achieved by introducing a pyridine group into the guest molecule. Anti&#8208;counterfeiting printings were realized through various methods, including stylus printing, thermal printing and inkjet printing.







Abstract
Compared with inorganic long&#8208;lasting luminescent materials, organic room temperature phosphorescent (RTP) ones show several advantages, such as flexibility, transparency, solubility and color adjustability. However, organic RTP materials close to commercialization are still to be developed. In this work, we developed a new host&#8211;guest doping system with stimulus&#8208;responsive RTP characteristics, in which triphenylphosphine oxide (OPph3) acted host and benzo(dibenzo)phenothiazine dioxide derivatives as guests. Turn&#8208;on RTP effect was realized by mixing them together through co&#8208;crystallization or grinding, in which the efficient energy transfer from host to guest and the strong intersystem crossing (ISC) ability of the guest have played significant role. Further on, multistage stimulus&#8208;responsive RTP characteristics from grinding to chemical stimulus were achieved via introducing pyridine group into the guest molecule. In addition, the anti&#8208;counterfeiting printings were realized for these materials through various methods, including stylus printing, thermal printing and inkjet printing, which brings RTP materials closer to commercialization.

         <title>Synthesis and Structural Elucidation of Bisdibenzocorannulene in Multiple Redox States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical reduction/oxidation of a new type of curved &#960;&#8208;network (BDBC) provided access to its multiple redox states. For the one&#8208;electron reduced state, the BDBC.&#8722; was characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction as a solvent&#8208;separated radical anion; while the two&#8208;electron oxidized state was revealed as an unusual singlet diradical dication (BDBC..)2+. As a consequence of their redox behaviours, their structures and ring currents have large differences.







Abstract
We report an anti&#8208;folded bowl&#8208;shaped bisdibenzocorannulene (BDBC) featuring a new chair&#8208;cyclohexane&#8208;like hexagon as a bridge of two dibenzocorannulene moieties. The neutral compound showed multiple redox&#8208;active properties and could be converted to the corresponding redox states through chemical reduction or oxidation. Chemical reduction of BDBC by stoichiometric addition of metallic potassium in the presence of [18]crown&#8208;6 ether, provided a radical anion BDBC.&#8722; and a dianion BDBC2&#8722;, respectively; while chemical oxidation by silver hexafluoroantimonate(V), converted the neutral compound to an open&#8208;shell singlet diradical dication (BDBC..)2+. The structural consequences of both electron&#8208;reduction and oxidation were closely related to the release of ring&#8208;strain of the bowl&#8208;shaped &#960;&#8208;scaffold and imposed steric hindrance of the hexagonal bridge. In addition, the unusual open&#8208;shell nature of the dication could mainly be attributed to the changing of localized antiaromaticity in the closed&#8208;shell structure to delocalized character in the biradical, and thus the emergence of weakly bonded &#960;&#8208;electrons.

         <title>Discharge&#8208;Induced Enhancement of the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Current mechanism studies mainly concern on surface reconstruction at high potential with respect to formation of high&#8208;valence metal sites and metal oxyhydroxides. The understanding of correlation between low potential scanning, surface structure, and electrochemical activity is lacking. This work suggests that the low applied potential region must be a primary consideration in evaluating the origin of the activity of electrocatalysts.







Abstract
The fundamental understanding of the surface reconstruction induced by the applied potential is of great significance for enhancing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, we show that a previously overlooked discharge current in the low applied potential region also leads to in situ electrochemical activation of a nitrogen&#8208;doped nickel oxyhydroxide surface. We exploit the fact that doping of heteroatoms weakens the surface structure, and hence, a weak discharge current originating from the capacitive nature of nickel oxyhydroxide has a strong structure&#8208;reforming ability to promote the formation of nitrogen and oxygen vacancies. The current density at 1.4&#8197;V (vs. Hg/HgO) can dramatically increase by as much as 31.3&#8201;% after discharge in the low applied potential region. This work provides insight into in situ enhancement of the OER and suggests that the low applied potential region must be a primary consideration in evaluating the origin of the activity of electrocatalysts.

         <title>Di(indenyl)beryllium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The final puzzle piece fits in! Beryllium is the last of the non&#8208;radioactive s&#8208;block metals to be coordinated to indenyl ligands. Milling K[C9H7] with BeBr2 produces the indenyl complex [Be(C9H7)2]. Its crystal structure reveals mixed &#951;5/&#951;1 ring coordination. The monomeric &#8220;half&#8208;sandwich&#8221; complex [Be{1,3&#8208;(SiMe3)2C9H5}Br] is available via the same method.







Abstract
The bonding in beryllocene, [BeCp2], took decades to establish, owing to its unexpected mixed hapticity structure (i.e., [Be(&#951;5&#8208;Cp)(&#951;1&#8208;Cp)]). Beryllium complexes containing the indenyl ligand, which is a close relative of the cyclopentadienyl anion, but which is also known to exhibit its own bonding peculiarities (e.g., facile &#951;5 &#8644; &#951;3 shifts), have remained unknown. Standard metathetical approaches to their synthesis (e.g., with K[Ind&#8242;] + BeX2 in an ether solvent) give rise to intractable oils from which nothing identifiable can be isolated. In contrast, mechanochemical preparation, involving the solvent&#8208;free grinding of BeBr2 and potassium indenides, leads to the production of discrete (indenyl)beryllium complexes, including [Be(C9H7)2] (1) and [Be{1,3&#8208;(SiMe3)2C9H5}Br] (2). The former displays &#951;5/&#951;1&#8208;coordinated ligands in the solid state, but DFT calculations indicate that an &#951;5/&#951;5&#8208;conformation is less than 5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 higher in energy.

         <title>Green Conversion of CO2 and Propargylamines Triggered by Triply Synergistic Catalytic Effects in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mixed valence copper&#8208;based cationic framework {[(CuI6I5)Cu3IIL6(DMA)3](NO3)&#8901;9DMA}n was synthesized. The material realized the efficient and green conversion of propargylamine with CO2 in flue gas under solvent&#8208;free and co&#8208;catalyst free conditions.







Abstract
Cyclization of propargylamines with CO2 to obtain 2&#8208;oxazolidone heterocyclic compounds is an essential reaction in industry but it is usually catalyzed by noble&#8208;metal catalysts with organic bases as co&#8208;catalysts under harsh conditions. We have synthesized a unique CuI/CuII mixed valence copper&#8208;based framework {[(CuI6I5)Cu3IIL6(DMA)3](NO3)&#8901;9DMA}n (1) with good solvent and thermal stability, as well as a high density of uncoordinated amino groups evenly distributed in the large nanoscopic channels. Catalytic experiments show that 1 can effectively catalyze the reaction of propargylamines with CO2, and the yield can reach 99&#8201;%. The turnover frequency (TOF) reaches a record value of 230&#8197;h&#8722;1, which is much higher than that of reported noble&#8208;metal catalysts. Importantly, this is the first report of heterogeneously catalyzed green conversion of propargylamines with CO2 without solvents and co&#8208;catalysts under low temperature and atmospheric pressure. A mechanistic study reveals that a triply synergistic catalytic effect between CuI/CuII and uncoordinated amino groups promotes highly efficient and green conversion of CO2. Furthermore, 1 directly catalyzes this reaction with high efficiency when using simulated flue gas as a CO2 source.

         <title>Influence of Backbone Curvature on the Organic Electrochemical Transistor Performance of Glycolated Donor&#8211;Acceptor Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The targeted design of backbone geometries is shown to influence the p&#8208;type accumulation mode organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) performance of two glycolated donor&#8211;acceptor conjugated polymers, PgBT(F)2gT and PgBT(F)2gTT.







Abstract
Two new glycolated semiconducting polymers PgBT(F)2gT and PgBT(F)2gTT of differing backbone curvatures were designed and synthesised for application as p&#8208;type accumulation mode organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) materials. Both polymers demonstrated stable and reversible oxidation, accessible within the aqueous electrochemical window, to generate polaronic charge carriers. OECTs fabricated from PgBT(F)2gT featuring a curved backbone geometry attained a higher volumetric capacitance of 170&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3. However, PgBT(F)2gTT with a linear backbone displayed overall superior OECT performance with a normalised peak transconductance of 3.00&#215;104&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1, owing to its enhanced order, expediting the charge mobility to 0.931&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two benzo&#8208;fused tri[8]annulenes were synthesized via cyclotrimerization reactions, introducing two valid model compounds of the yet elusive carbon allotrope cubic graphite. Both conformers do not interconvert via temperature&#8208; or light&#8208;induced stimuli.







Abstract
Cyclotrimerization of 9,10&#8208;dibromo&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[3,4:7,8]cycloocta[1,2&#8208;l]phenanthrene with potassium tert&#8208;butoxide in the presence of a transition&#8208;metal catalyst afforded two polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon stereoisomers consisting of three cyclooctatetraene (COT) moieties connected via a central benzene ring. Both isomeric tri[8]annulenes were obtained selectively through the choice of the catalyst: The &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;form (Ru catalyst) displayed a threefold symmetrywith the COT subunits forming the side walls of a (chiral) molecular cup. In the thermodynamically more stable &#945;,&#945;,&#946;&#8208;isomer (Pd catalyst), one of the three boat&#8208;shaped COTs was flipped over and faced the opposite molecular hemisphere with respect to the central benzene ring as evidenced by crystal structure analysis. Both title compounds are small segments of &#8220;cubic graphite&#8221;, an elusive carbon allotrope.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of C&#8208;Vinyl Glycosides via Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Glycosylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy has been developed for stereoselective synthesis of C&#8208;vinyl glycosides via Pd&#8208;catalyzed directed C&#8722;H glycosylation of alkenes with glycosyl chloride donors using an easily removable bidentate auxiliary.







Abstract
C&#8208;vinyl glycosides are an important class of carbohydrates and pose a unique synthetic challenge. A new strategy has been developed for stereoselective synthesis of C&#8208;vinyl glycosides via Pd&#8208;catalyzed directed C&#8722;H glycosylation of alkenes with glycosyl chloride donors using an easily removable bidentate auxiliary. Both the &#947; C&#8722;H bond of allylamines and the &#948; C&#8722;H bond of homoallyl amine substrates can be glycosylated in high efficiency and with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. The resulting C&#8208;vinyl glycosides can be further converted to a variety of C&#8208;alkyl glycosides with high stereospecificity. These reactions offer a broadly applicable method to streamline the synthesis of complex C&#8208;vinyl glycosides from easily accessible starting materials.

         <title>Tuning Electrostatic Gating of Semiconducting Carbon Nanotubes by Controlling Protein Orientation in Biosensing Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoscale protein&#8208;based sensing devices designed to present proteins in defined orientations allowed the control of local electrostatic surface presented within the Debye length, and thus modulation of the conductance gating effect upon sensing protein targets.







Abstract
The ability to detect proteins through gating conductance by their unique surface electrostatic signature holds great potential for improving biosensing sensitivity and precision. Two challenges are: (1) defining the electrostatic surface of the incoming ligand protein presented to the conductive surface; (2) bridging the Debye gap to generate a measurable response. Herein, we report the construction of nanoscale protein&#8208;based sensing devices designed to present proteins in defined orientations; this allowed us to control the local electrostatic surface presented within the Debye length, and thus modulate the conductance gating effect upon binding incoming protein targets. Using a &#946;&#8208;lactamase binding protein (BLIP2) as the capture protein attached to carbon nanotube field effect transistors in different defined orientations. Device conductance had influence on binding TEM&#8208;1, an important &#946;&#8208;lactamase involved in antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Conductance increased or decreased depending on TEM&#8208;1 presenting either negative or positive local charge patches, demonstrating that local electrostatic properties, as opposed to protein net charge, act as the key driving force for electrostatic gating. This, in turn can, improve our ability to tune the gating of electrical biosensors toward optimized detection, including for AMR as outlined herein.

         <title>Standardization and Control of Grignard Reactions in a Universal Chemical Synthesis Machine using online NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal chemical synthesis platform was extended by online NMR to allow adjustments of the encoded reactions on the fly. The approach was demonstrated on the class of Grignard reactions showing robust analytical results under harsh conditions. Real&#8208;time process analytics and the use of straightforward feedback control algorithm enhance the usability of available synthesis formula considering existing deviations.







Abstract
A big problem with the chemistry literature is that it is not standardized with respect to precise operational parameters, and real time corrections are hard to make without expert knowledge. This lack of context means difficult reproducibility because many steps are ambiguous, and hence depend on tacit knowledge. Here we present the integration of online NMR into an automated chemical synthesis machine (CSM aka. &#8220;Chemputer&#8221; which is capable of small&#8208;molecule synthesis using a universal programming language) to allow automated analysis and adjustment of reactions on the fly. The system was validated and benchmarked by using Grignard reactions which were chosen due to their importance in synthesis. The system was monitored in real time using online&#8208;NMR, and spectra were measured continuously during the reactions. This shows that the synthesis being done in the Chemputer can be dynamically controlled in response to feedback optimizing the reaction conditions according to the user requirements.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Switchable Cycloisomerization of Alkynoic Acids with Napthalenediimide&#8208;Derived N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a series of rhodium(I) and iridium(I) complexes with a naphthalene&#8208;di&#8208;imide N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand that behave as effective redox&#8208;switchable catalysts for the cycloisomerization of alkynoic acids. The catalysts can adopt three electronically different stages with distinct catalytic activities. The activity of catalysts can toggle between the activated and inactivated forms for several cycles.







Abstract
Two naphthalene&#8208;diimide (NDI) bis&#8208;imidazolium salts have been used as N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) precursors for the preparation of NDI&#8208;functionalized complexes of rhodium and iridium of general formula [MCl(NDI&#8208;NHC)(COD)] (M=Rh, Ir; NDI&#8208;NHC=NDI&#8208;functionalized NHC ligand). Comparison of the IR spectra of the complexes [IrCl(NDI&#8208;NHC)(CO)2] and their related one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron reduced forms, reveal that each one&#8208;electron reduction produces a decrease of the average &#957;(CO) of 9&#8211;10&#8197;cm&#8722;1, indicating a significant enhancement of the electron&#8208;richness of the metal. The [MCl(NDI&#8208;NHC)(COD)] complexes were tested in the catalytic cycloisomerization of alkynoic acids. The one&#8208;electron reduced forms showed greatly enhanced activities. For the cyclization of 5&#8208;hexynoic acid, the two&#8208;electron reduction of the ligand produced further enhancement of the catalytic activity, therefore showing that the catalyst can switch between three redox species with three distinct catalytic activities.

         <title>Simultaneous Chiral Resolution of Two Racemic Compounds by Preferential Cocrystallization**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two racemic compounds are combined to form a stable conglomerate system. Both compounds are simultaneously resolved through a single preferential cocrystallization process, showing excellent enantiopurity towards both compounds.







Abstract
We tap into an unexplored area of preferential crystallization, being the first to develop simultaneous chiral resolution of two racemic compounds by preferential cocrystallization. We highlight how the two racemic compounds RS&#8208;mandelic acid (MAN) and RS&#8208;etiracetam (ETI) can be combined together as enantiospecific R&#8208;MAN&#8901;R&#8208;ETI and S&#8208;MAN&#8901;S&#8208;ETI cocrystals forming a stable conglomerate system and subsequently develop a cyclic preferential crystallization allowing to simultaneous resolve both compounds.

     alt="Simultaneous Chiral Resolution of Two Racemic Compounds by Preferential Cocrystallization**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two racemic compounds are combined to form a stable conglomerate system. Both compounds are simultaneously resolved through a single preferential cocrystallization process, showing excellent enantiopurity towards both compounds.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tap into an unexplored area of preferential crystallization, being the first to develop simultaneous chiral resolution of two racemic compounds by preferential cocrystallization. We highlight how the two racemic compounds &lt;i&gt;RS&lt;/i&gt;-mandelic acid (MAN) and &lt;i&gt;RS&lt;/i&gt;-etiracetam (ETI) can be combined together as enantiospecific R-MAN&#8901;R-ETI and S-MAN&#8901;S-ETI cocrystals forming a stable conglomerate system and subsequently develop a cyclic preferential crystallization allowing to simultaneous resolve &lt;i&gt;both compounds&lt;/i&gt;. The developed process leads to excellent enantiopurity both for etiracetam (&lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;&amp;gt;98&#8201;%) and mandelic acid (&lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;&#8776;95&#8201;%) enantiomers.&lt;/p&gt;

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While halide and oxide perovskites are numerous and many display outstanding properties, ABN  3  perovskite nitrides are extremely rare due synthetic challenges arising from the low chemical potential of nitrogen and a tendency to form low&#8208;coordination nitridometallate anions. Here we report the preparation of a perovskite nitride LaReN  3  through azide&#8208;mediated oxidation at high pressure. High&#8208;resolution synchrotron diffraction shows that LaReN  3  has a low symmetry, triclinic, perovskite superstructure resulting from orbital ordering with strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling distortions. Topotactic reduction of LaReN  3  above 500 &#176;C leads to layered tetragonal LaReN  2  via a probable LaReN  2.5  intermediate, the first reported examples of nitride defect&#8208;perovskites. Magnetisation and conductivity measurements indicate that LaReN  3  and LaReN  2  are both metallic solids. The two chemical approaches presented here are expected to lead to new classes of ABN  3  and defect ABN  3&#8722;x  nitride perovskite materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
Conductive Dy3+ phthalocyaninato complex single&#8208;molecule magnet, which exhibits slow magnetic relaxation, can be arranged in a 1D array by using electro&#8208;oxidation and chemical oxidation. Hysteresis of the magnetoresistance of the 1D array derived from the &#960;&#8208;f interactions was observed at 2.2&#8197;K.







Abstract
A one&#8208;dimensional (1D) arrangement of an unsubstituted partially oxidized Dy3+ double&#8208;decker complex, [DyPc2]Ix (Pc=phthalocyaninato, I=iodide; 1.93&lt;x&lt;2.26) (1), was obtained by using electro&#8208;oxidation and chemical oxidation. In 1, the Pc ligands were partially oxidized, and I3&#8722; ion was present as a counter ion. From the results of spectrophotometric analysis on 1, the &#960; radicals were delocalized in a 1D column and behaved as a conductor even at low&#8208;temperatures. Since conductivity was observed at temperatures lower than the blocking temperature (TB), magnetoresistance (MR) effects corresponding to a magnetic hysteresis of single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) were observed when the galvanomagnetic characteristics were investigated at 2.2&#8197;K.

         <title>Rational design of sustainable liquid microcapsules for spontaneous fragrance encapsulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:  &#160;Food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries rely on microencapsulation to grant the stability of products as well as protection and controlled release of active compounds. Concerning the fragrance technological sector, the high volatility, water&#8208;immiscibility, and light/oxygen&#8208;sensitivity of most aroma compounds represent a challenge to their incorporation in liquid consumer products. Current encapsulation methods entail the use of petroleum&#8208;based materials, initiators, and crosslinkers as well as mixing, heating, and purification steps. Hence, more efficient and eco&#8208;friendly approaches to encapsulation must be sought. In this work, we propose a simple method by making use of a pre&#8208;formed amphiphilic polymer and employing the Hansen Solubility Parameters approach to determine which fragrances could be encapsulated by spontaneous coacervation in water. The coacervates do not precipitate as solids but they remain suspended as colloidally stable liquid microcapsules, as demonstrated by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. The effective encapsulation of fragrance is proven through confocal Raman spectroscopy, while the structure of the capsules is investigated by means of cryo FIB/SEM, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Lead&#8208;free halide perovskites have triggered appealing interests in the field of optoelectronics and photocatalysis due to their low toxicity, tunable optical and charge carrier properties. For the application point of view, it is desired to develop stable lead&#8208;free halide perovskites with multifunction. Herein, we successfully developed a series of Cs  2  Pt  x  Sn  1&#8208;x  Cl  6  (0&#8804;x&#8804;1) with high stability, which show switchable photoluminescence and photocatalytic functions by varying the amount of Pt  4+  substitution. The Cs  2  Pt  x  Sn  1&#8208;x  Cl  6  solid solution with dominant proportion of Pt  4+  shows broadband photoluminescence with lifetime in microsecond&#8208;timescale. The Cs  2  Pt  x  Sn  1&#8208;x  Cl  6  solid solution with small amount of Pt  4+  substitution exhibits photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity. Optical spectroscopy study reveals the switch between photoluminescence and photocatalysis function is controlled by sub&#8208;bandgap states. Our finding provides a new way to develop lead&#8208;free halide perovskites with multifunction and high stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Incorporated Cobalt Diselenide with Cubic Phase Maintaining for Enhanced Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Introduction of heteroatom is regarded as one of the most important ways to modulate the intrinsic electronic structure of electrocatalysts to improve the catalytic activity. However, for transition metal chalcogenides with highly symmetric crystal structure (HS&#8208;TMC), the introduction of heteroatom, especially those with large atomic radius, often induces large lattice distortion and vacancy defects, which may lead to structural phase transition of doped materials or structural phase reconstruction during catalytic reaction. Such unpredictable situations will make it difficult to explore the connection between intrinsic electronic structure of doped catalysts and catalytic activity. Herein, taking thermodynamically stable cubic CoSe2 phase as an example, we demonstrate that a light element doping strategy, nitrogen incorporation, can effectively regulate the intrinsic electronic structure of HS&#8208;TMC with structural phase stability and thus promote its electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity. As a comparison, we also confirm that the introduction of phosphorus (with a relatively large atomic radius) can lead to structural phase transition from cubic CoSe2 to orthorhombic phase, and the structural phase of phosphorus doped CoSe2 is unstable for HER. Our work put forward a new insight into the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts with highly symmetric crystal structure based on the doping strategy.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Introduction of heteroatom is regarded as one of the most important ways to modulate the intrinsic electronic structure of electrocatalysts to improve the catalytic activity. However, for transition metal chalcogenides with highly symmetric crystal structure (HS-TMC), the introduction of heteroatom, especially those with large atomic radius, often induces large lattice distortion and vacancy defects, which may lead to structural phase transition of doped materials or structural phase reconstruction during catalytic reaction. Such unpredictable situations will make it difficult to explore the connection between intrinsic electronic structure of doped catalysts and catalytic activity. Herein, taking thermodynamically stable cubic CoSe2 phase as an example, we demonstrate that a light element doping strategy, nitrogen incorporation, can effectively regulate the intrinsic electronic structure of HS-TMC with structural phase stability and thus promote its electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity. As a comparison, we also confirm that the introduction of phosphorus (with a relatively large atomic radius) can lead to structural phase transition from cubic CoSe2 to orthorhombic phase, and the structural phase of phosphorus doped CoSe2 is unstable for HER. Our work put forward a new insight into the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts with highly symmetric crystal structure based on the doping strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Twelve BGCs that are bioinformatically predicted to encode 6 new congeners were recovered from soil metagenomic libraries.

         <title>PNA&#8208;Guided Peptide Engineering of Aptamer Sensor for Protease&#8208;Unlocked Molecular Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protease&#8208;triggered control of functional DNA has remained unachieved, leaving a significant gap in activatable DNA biotechnology. Here we disclose the design of a protease&#8208;activatable aptamer technology that can perform molecular sensing and imaging function in a tumor&#8208;specific manner. The system is constructed by locking structure&#8208;switching activity of aptamer using a rationally designed PNA&#8208;peptide&#8208;PNA triblock copolymer. Highly selective cleavage of the peptide substrate is achieved by protease&#8208;mediated enzymatic reaction that result in reduced binding affinity of PNA to the aptamer module, with the subsequently recovering its biosensing function. We demonstrated that the DNA/peptide/PNA hybrid system not only allows for tumor cell&#8208;selective ATP imaging  in vitro  , but it also produce a fluorescent signal  in vivo  with improved tumor specificity. This work illustrates the potential of bridging the gap between functional DNA field and peptide area for precise biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium(I) Complexes Bearing an Aryl&#8208;Substituted 1,3,5&#8208;Hexatriene Chain: Catalysts for Living Polymerization of Phenylacetylene and Potential Helical Chirality of 1,3,5&#8208;Hexatrienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unique and bench&#8208;stable rhodium(I) complexes bearing an aryl&#8208;substituted 1,3,5&#8208;hexatriene chain have been synthesized by the reactions of bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta&#8208;2,5&#8208;diene&#8208;rhodium(I) chloride dimer ([Rh(nbd)Cl]2) with aryl boronic acids and diphenylacetylenes in the presence of a 50% aqueous solution of KOH. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of the isolated complexes indicated a square&#8208;planar structure stabilized by a strong interaction with one of the aryl groups on the 1,3,5&#8208;hexatriene chain, which has a helical structure. The helical chirality of the isolated rhodium complexes was confirmed to be sufficiently stable to be resolved by chiral HPLC at room temperature into enantiomers, which showed mirror&#8208;imaged CD spectra. It was confirmed that the isolated rhodium complex worked as an initiator for living polymerization of phenylacetylene to give  cis&#8208;stereoregular poly(phenylacetylene) with a well&#8208;controlled molecular weight.</dc:description>

         <title>Facet&#8208;Dependent Oxidative Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interactions of Pd&#8208;TiO2 via In Situ TEM</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) is widely used in&#160;supported metal catalysts and extensive studies have been performed to understand the SMSI. Although considerable progress has been achieved, the surface structure of the support, as an important influencing factor, is usually ignored. Here, we report a facet&#8208;dependent SMSI of Pd&#8208;TiO  2  in oxygen by using in situ atmospheric pressure TEM. It is revealed that the Pd NPs supported on TiO  2  (101) and (100) surfaces showed encapsulation. In contrast, no such cover layer was observed in Pd&#8208;TiO  2  (001) catalyst under the same conditions. This facet&#8208;dependent SMSI, which originates from the different surface structure of the support, was demonstrated in a probe reaction of methane combustion catalyzed by Pd&#8208;TiO  2  . Our discovery of the oxidative facet&#8208;dependent SMSI gives direct evidence of the important role of the support surface structure in SMSI and provides a new way to tune the interaction between metal NPs and the support as well as catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we describe a new catalysis platform, supramolecular carbon&#8208;bonding catalysis, which exploits the highly directional weak interactions between carbon centres of catalysts and electron donors to drive chemical reactions. To demonstrate this catalysis approach, we discovered a class of cyclopropane derivatives incorporated with carbonyl, ester and cyano groups as catalysts which showed general catalysis capability in different types of benchmark reactions. Among these typical examples, a challenging tail&#8208;to&#8208;head terpene cyclization can be achieved by supramolecular carbon&#8208;bonding catalysis. The co&#8208;crystal structures of catalyst and electron donors, comparison experiments, and titrations support a catalysis mode of carbon&#8208;bonding activation of Lewis basic reactants.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphorized CoNi2S4 Yolk&#8208;Shell Spheres for Highly Efficient Hydrogen Production via Water and Urea Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring earth&#8208;abundant electrocatalysts with excellent activity, robust stability, and multiple functions is crucial for electrolytic hydrogen generation. Herein, porous phosphorized CoNi  2  S  4  yolk&#8208;shell spheres (P&#8208;CoNi  2  S  4  YSSs) are rationally designed and synthesized by a combined hydrothermal sulfidation and gas&#8208;phase phosphorization strategy. Benefiting from the strengthened Ni  3+  /Ni  2+  couple, enhanced electric conductivity, and hollow structure, the P&#8208;CoNi  2  S  4  YSSs exhibit excellent activity and durability towards hydrogen/oxygen evolution and urea oxidation reactions in alkaline solution, affording low potentials of &#8208;0.135 V, 1.512 V, and 1.306 V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode) at 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  , respectively. Remarkably, when used as the anode and cathode simultaneously, the P&#8208;CoNi  2  S  4  catalyst merely requires a cell voltage of 1.544 V in water splitting and 1.402 V in urea electrolysis to attain 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  with excellent durability for 100 h, outperforming most of the reported nickel&#8208;based sulfides and even noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. This work therefore not only promotes the application of sulfides in electrochemical hydrogen production but also provides a feasible approach for urea&#8208;rich wastewater treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Design and Crystal Structure of a Highly Efficient Benzoylecgonine Hydrolase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzoylecgonine (BZE) is the major toxic metabolite of cocaine, and is responsible for the long&#8208;term cocaine&#8208;induced toxicity due to its long residence time in humans. BZE is also the main contaminant following cocaine consumption, representing a risk to our environment and non&#8208;target organisms. Here, we identified the bacterial cocaine esterase (CocE) as a BZE&#8208;metabolizing enzyme (BZEase), which can degrade BZE into biological inactive metabolites (ecgonine and benzoic acid). CocE was redesigned by a reactant&#8208;state&#8208;based enzyme design theory. An encouraging mutant denoted as BZEase2, presented a &gt;400&#8208;fold improved catalytic efficiency against BZE compared with wild&#8208;type (WT) CocE.  In vivo  , a single dose of BZEase2 (1 mg/kg, IV) could eliminate nearly all BZE within only two minutes, suggesting the enzyme have the potential for cocaine overdose treatment and BZE&#160; elimination in the environment by accelerating BZE clearance. The crystal structure of a designed BZEase was determined, providing additional insights in support of our simulation results.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Nitric Oxide Reduction on Metal Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic denitrification is a promising technology for removing NOx species&#160; (NO3  &#8208;  , NO2  &#8208;  and NO). For NOx electroreduction (NOxRR), there is a desire for &#160;understanding the catalytic parameters that control the product distribution. Here, we elucidate selectivity and activity of catalyst for NOxRR. At low potential we classify metals by the binding of &#8194;NO versus &#8194;H. Analogous to classifying CO2 reduction by CO vs&#8194;H, Cu is able to bind&#8194;NO while not binding &#8194;H giving rise to a selective NH3 formation. Besides being selective, Cu is active for the reaction found by an activity&#8208;volcano. For metals that does not bind NO the reaction stops at NO, similar to CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO. At potential above 0.3 V vs RHE, we speculate a low barrier for N coupling with NO causing N2O formation. The work provide a clear strategy for selectivity and aims to inspire future research on NOxRR.</dc:description>

         <title>Observability of paramagnetic NMR signals at over 10&#8201;000 ppm chemical shifts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report an experimental observation of  31  P NMR resonances shifted by over 10&#8201;000 ppm (meaning  percent  range, and a new record for solutions), and similar  1  H chemical shifts, in an intermediate&#8208;spin square planar ferrous complex [  t  Bu  (PNP)Fe&#8211;H], where PNP is a carbazole based pincer ligand. Using a combination of electronic structure theory, nuclear magnetic resonance, magnetometry, and terahertz electron paramagnetic resonance, the influence of magnetic anisotropy and zero&#8208;field splitting on the paramagnetic shift and relaxation enhancement is investigated. Detailed spin dynamics simulations indicate that, even with relatively slow electron spin relaxation (  T  1  ~ 10  &#8208;11  s), it remains possible to observe NMR signals of directly metal&#8208;bonded atoms because pronounced rhombicity in the electron zero&#8208;field splitting reduces nuclear paramagnetic relaxation enhancement.</dc:description>

         <title>Imaging of Cancer Cells and Dictated Cytotoxicity Using Aptamer&#8208;Guided Hybridization Chain Reaction (HCR)&#8208;Generated G&#8208;Quadruplex Chains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA nanotechnology provides powerful tools for developing cancer theranostics. Here we introduce the autonomous surface&#8208;nucleolin&#8208;guided HCR that leads to the polymerization of G&#8208;quadruplex polymer chains, in which the Zn(II)&#8208;protoporphyrin IX is intercalated. We demonstrate that MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 (Triple Negative Breast Cancer cells, TNBC) with overexpressed surface nucleolin were able to induce HCR leading to the formation of the Zn(II)PPIX&#8208;loaded G&#8208;quadruplex polymer chains, while the M10 epithelial breast cells served as control. The Zn(II)PPIX&#8208;loaded nanowires allow the selective imaging of TNBC, and their permeation into the TNBC leads to selective cytotoxicity and guided photodynamic therapy toward the cancer cells due to structural perturbation of the membranes. The aptamer&#8208;guided HCR&#8208;generated G&#8208;quadruplex polymer chains may serve as a versatile tool to target TNBC featuring poor prognosis and high pathological risk of recurrence, thus offering a promising theranostic platform.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Highly enantioselective Darzens&#8208;type epoxidation of diazoesters with glyoxal derivatives was accomplished using a chiral boron&#8208;Lewis acid catalyst, which facilitated asymmetric synthesis of trisubstituted  &#945;,&#946;  &#8208;epoxy esters. In the presence of a chiral oxazaborolidinium ion catalyst, the reaction proceeded in high yield (up to 99%) with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity (up to &gt;99% ee and &gt;20:1 dr, respectively). The synthetic potential of this method was illustrated by conversion of the products to various compounds such as epoxy  &#947;  &#8208;butyrolactone, tertiary  &#946;  &#8208;hydroxy ketone and epoxy diester.</dc:description>

         <title>Template Guiding for Regioselective Fabrication of Uniformly Sub&#8208;nanometric Pt Clusters in beta&#8208;Zeolites with High Catalytic Activity and Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Subnanometric metal clusters have attracted extensive attention due to their unique properties as homogeneous&#8208;like catalyst. However, it is a challenge to obtain the uniformly distributed metal cluster under harsh synthesis procedure and reaction condition. Herein, we report a middle&#8208;up protocol to synthesize subnanometric metal clusters that are uniformly encapsulated in beta&#8208;zeolite, in which the precursors of metal ions are anchored in the internal of zeolite by template guidance through electrostatic interaction. The Pt metal clusters with the narrow size range of 0.89 to 1.22 nm are obtained on the intersectional sites of beta&#8208;zeolite (Pt@beta) with broad Si/Al molar ratio from 15 to 200. The strong interaction of Pt and zeolite in Pt@beta is effective to promote the spillover of active hydrogen, giving an excellent activity and stability for hydrodeoxygenation reaction. The proposed strategy provides a general strategy for the regioselective encapsulation of subnanometric metal clusters in zeolite with high thermal stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Can One Measure Resonance Raman Optical Activity?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Resonance Raman optical activity (RROA) is commonly measured as the difference in intensity of Raman scattered right and left circularly polarized light,  I  R  &#8211; I  L  ,  when a randomly polarized light is in resonance with a chiral molecule. Strong and sometimes mono&#8208;signate experimental RROA spectra of several chiral solutes were reported previously, although their signs and relative intensities could not be reproduced theoretically. By examining multiple light&#8208;matter interaction events which can occur simultaneously under resonance, we show that a new form of chiral Raman spectroscopy,  eCP&#8208;Raman  , a combination of electronic circular dichroism and circularly polarized Raman, prevails. By incorporating the finite&#8208;lifetime approach for resonance, the experimental patterns of the model chiral solutes are captured theoretically by  eCP&#8208;Raman  , without any RROA contribution. The results open opportunity for applications of  eCP&#8208;Raman  spectroscopy and for extracting  true  RROA experimentally.</dc:description>

         <title>Key Features of Polyimide&#8208;Derived Carbon Molecular Sieves</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes have impressive separation properties; however, both chemical and morphology structures need to be understood better. Here we characterize CMS with the simplest polyimide (PI) PMDA/pPDA (PMDA=Pyromellitic Dianhydride, pPDA=  p  &#8208;Phenylenediamine), using FTIR, solid state  15  N&#8208;NMR,  13  C&#8208;NMR, XPS, XRD, and Raman spectra to study chemical structure. We also compare gas separation properties for this CMS to a CMS derived from a more conventional polyimide precursor. The detailed characterization shows the presence of aromatic pyridinic, pyrrolic rings as well as graphitic, pyridonic components and a few other groups in both CMS types derived from the very different precursors. The CMS morphologies, while related to precursor and pyrolysis temperature details, show similarities consistent with a physical picture comprising distributed molecular sieving plate&#8208;like structures. These results assist in understanding diverse CMS membrane separation performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Regio&#8208;controllable Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Sequential Hydrosilylation/ Hydroboration of Arylacetylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regiodivergent addition reactions provide straightforward and atom&#8208;economic approaches to access different regioisomers. However, the regio&#8208;chemistry control to access all the possible results is still challenging especially for the reaction involving multiple addition steps. Herein, we reported regio&#8208;controllable cobalt&#8208;catalyzed sequential hydrosilylation/hydroboration of arylacetylenes, delivering all the possible regio&#8208;outcomes with high regioselectivities (up to &gt;20/1  rr  for all the cases). Each regioisomer of value&#8208;added silylboronates could be efficiently and regioselectively obtained from the same materials. The adjustment of the ligands of cobalt catalysts combined with dual catalysis relay strategy is the key to achieve regio&#8208;chemistry control. This regio&#8208;controllable research might inspire the exploration of the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis that involve multiple additions and provide full sets of regioisomers of other synthetic useful molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Quick and Easy Method for Dramatic Improvement of the Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Activity of an Iron Porphyrin Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of artificial molecular catalysts for CO  2  reduction is the key to solving energy and environmental problems. Although chemical modifications can generally improve the catalytic activity of this class of compounds, they often require complicated synthetic procedures. Here, we report a simple procedure that dramatically enhances electrochemical CO  2  reduction activity. A one&#8208;step counteranion exchange reaction increased the solubility of a commercially available catalyst, iron(III) tetraphenylporphyrin chloride, in a variety of solvents, allowing the investigation of its catalytic performance under various conditions. Surprisingly, the turnover frequency for CO evolution in acetonitrile (MeCN) reached 7,300,000 s  &#8211;1  , which is the highest among those of current best&#8208;in&#8208;class molecular catalysts. This excellent catalytic activity originates from the unique reaction between the generated Fe(I) species and CO  2  in MeCN during catalysis. The present study offers a &#8220;quick and easy&#8221; method for obtaining an efficient catalytic system for electrochemical CO  2  reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;assembled Organic Co&#8208;crystals Metal&#8208;organic Framework for Biological Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic self&#8208;assembled co&#8208;crystals have garnered considerable attention due to their facile synthesis and  intriguing  properties, such as room temperature ferroelectricity and two&#8208;photon absorption ability. However, the supramolecular interactions of co&#8208;crystals restrict their stability in the aqueous solution phase, which is especially important for biological applications. Herein, we reported on the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept biological application of self&#8208;assembled organic co&#8208;crystals via the construction of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) &#8208;stabilized co&#8208;crystals. In particular, we built an electron&#8208;deficient MOF with naphthalene diimide (NDI) as the ligand and biocompatible Ca  2+  as the metal nodes. An electron donor molecule, pyrene, was encapsulated to form the host&#8208;guest MOF self&#8208;assembled co&#8208;crystal. We observed that such MOF structure leads to uniquely high&#8208;density ordered arrangement and the close intermolecular distance (3.47 &#197;) of the charge transfer pairs. Hence, the concomitant superior charge transfer interaction between pyrene/NDI can be enhanced and the resultant photothermal conversion efficiency of Py@Ca&#8208;NDI in aqueous solution can thus reach up to 41.8%, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the highest value among the reported organic co&#8208;crystal materials as well as most of the reported MOFs. Based on this realization, as a proof of concept, we demonstrated that such a self&#8208;assembled organic co&#8208;crystal platform can be used in biological applications that are exemplified via highly effective long wavelength light photothermal therapy. This conceptual work demonstrates the feasibility of using organic co&#8208;crystals in aqueous solution and should pave the way to a wide variety of photonic and biophotonic applications via such new platforms.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Cation&#8208;Olefin Monocyclization by Engineered Squalene&#8208;Hopene Cyclases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Squalene&#8208;hopene cyclases (SHCs) have great potential for the industrial synthesis of enantiopure cyclic terpenoids. A limitation of SHC catalysis so far, however, has been the enzymes&#8217; strict (  S  )&#8208;enantioselectivity at the stereocenter formed after the first cyclization step. To gain enantio&#8208;complementary access to valuable monocyclic terpenoids such as (  R  )&#8208; and (  S  )&#8208;&#947;&#8208;dihydroionone, an SHC wild&#8208;type library including 18 novel homologs was set up. A previously not described SHC from&#160;  Acidothermus cellulolyticus  &#160;(  Aci  SHC) was found to synthesize small amounts of the desired monocyclic (  R  )&#8208;&#947;&#8208;dihydroionone from (  E/Z  )&#8208;geranylacetone. Using enzyme and process optimization, the conversion to the desired product was increased by two orders of magnitude&#160;to 79%.&#160;Notably, analyzed&#160;  Aci  SHC variants could finely differentiate between the geometric geranylacetone isomers: While the  Z  &#8208;isomer yielded the desired monocyclic (  R  )&#8208;&#947;&#8208;dihydroionone (&gt;99%&#160;  ee  ), the&#160;  E  &#8208;isomer was converted to the (  S  ,  S  )&#8208;bicyclic ether (&gt;95%&#160;  ee  ). Applying the knowledge gained from the observed stereodivergent and enantioselective transformations to an additional SHC&#8208;substrate pair, access to the complementary (  S  )&#8208;&#947;&#8208;dihydroionone (&gt;99.9%&#160;  ee  ) could be obtained through substrate engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Constitutional Frameworks as antibacterial and antibiofilm agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic Constitutional Frameworks (DCFs) were synthesized and screened for biofilm inhibition or disruption. They are composed of a trialdehyde core reversibly linked to a diamine PEG connector and to a variety of neutral, anionic or cationic heads, to generate a library of DCFs to generate multivalent dendritic architectures in the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. The best DCFs were always polycationic and the nature of the cationic heads significantly impact the antibiofilm activity. The best antibiofilm activity was observed for DCF3B, displaying a polyethyleneimine head. Interestingly, a simple inactive guanidinium functional head, strongly inhibited biofilm growth when assayed as a multivalent DCF3C. Using a more advanced in vitro bio&#64257;lm model of chronic wound infection, DCF3C was found significantly superior than all other DCFs. These results demonstrate 1) the versatility and effectiveness of DCFs as low cost and efficient systems for antibiofilm disruption 2) the efficiency of dynamic chemistry as a discovery technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethane to Ethylene in a Solid Oxide Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene is an important process in light olefin industry; however,  the  over&#8208;oxidation  of ethane  leads to low ethylene selectivity. Here, we report a novel approach to electrochemical oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane in anode in conjunction with CO  2  reduction at cathode in a solid oxide electrolyser using a porous single&#8208;crystalline CeO  2  electrode at 600&#176;C. We identify and engineer the flux and chemical states of active oxygen species that evolve from the lattice at anode surface in order to activate and dehydrogenate ethane to ethylene  via  the reaction of epoxy species. Active oxygen species (O  2  &#8722;  , O  2  2  &#8722;  and O  2  &#8722;  ) at the anode surface effectively dehydrogenate ethane to ethylene, but O  &#8722;  species tend to induce deep oxidation. We demonstrate exceptionally high ethylene selectivity of 95% and an ethane conversion of 10% with a durable operation of 300 h.</dc:description>

         <title>A Congruent&#8208;Melting Mid&#8208;Infrared Nonlinear Optical Vanadate Exhibiting Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mid&#8208;infrared (mid&#8208;IR) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials are vital for the development of photonics research and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art laser technology, but the study of these important optoelectronic materials is hindered by the competing requirements of optimized second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) coefficient dij and laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (LIDT), as well as the harsh synthetic conditions that are usually needed. Herein, we report the facile hydrothermal synthesis of a polar NLO vanadate Cs4V8O22 (CVO) featuring a quasi&#8208;rigid honeycomb&#8208;layered structure with [VO4] and [VO5] polyhedra aligned parallel. CVO possesses a wide IR&#8208;transparent window, high LIDT, and congruent&#8208;melting behavior.&#160;In particular, it displays very strong phase&#8208;matchable SHG intensities in the metal vanadate family (12.0 &#215; KH2PO4 @ 1064 nm and 2.2 &#215; AgGaS2 @ 2100 nm). First&#8208;principles calculations suggest that the exceptional SHG responses of CVO largely originate from virtual electronic transitions within the [V4O11]&#8734; layer, and that the excellent optical transmittance of CVO arises from the special characteristics of vibrational phonons resulting from the layered structure. These attributes suggest that CVO is an outstanding mid&#8208;IR NLO candidate material.</dc:description>

         <title>Feedback and Communication in Active Hydrogel Spheres with pH Fronts: Facile Approaches to Grow Soft Hydrogel Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Signal gating, communication, memory, and pattern formation are central to living systems, which operate under energy consuming, feedback&#8208;driven reaction networks. Programming systems realizing these phenomena will provide increasingly life&#8208;like materials with new emerging functions. Moving towards this, we compartmentalized urea&#8208;urease and more complex urea&#8208;urease/ester&#8208;esterase pH&#8208;feedback reaction networks into alginate hydrogel spheres and investigate how fuel&#8208;driven pH fronts can be sent out from these spheres and regulated by internal reaction networks. Further, we install membrane characteristic by covering urea&#8208;urease spheres with responsive hydrogel shells. In a systems chemistry approach, we then encapsulate the two antagonistic networks (urea&#8208;urease and ester&#8208;esterase) separately into different hydrogel spheres to devise communication, pattern formation, and attraction. We showcase that these pH fronts and pH front patterns can be used to localize peptide&#8208;based fibrillar hydrogels and can be used to develop complex geometric gel structures without 3D printing tools and for hydrogels that fail to be printable using classical extrusion printing. This study bridges systems chemistry and materials science aspects and opens a new scope for feedback&#8208;controlled compartmentalized reaction networks in developing smart, adaptive soft materials of non&#8208;injectable supramolecular gels.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon Nitride Supported&#160;High&#8208;Loading Fe Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Activating of Peroxymonosulfate to Generate 1O2&#160;with 100% Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Singlet oxygen (1O2) is an excellent active species for the selective degradation of organic pollutions. However, it is difficult to achieve high efficiency and selectivity for the generation of  1O2. In this work, we develop a graphitic carbon nitride supported Fe single&#8208;atoms catalyst (Fe1/CN) containing highly uniform Fe&#8208;N4  active sites with a high Fe loading of 11.2 wt%. The Fe1/CN achieves generation of 100%  1O2  by activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS), which shows an ultrahigh p&#8208;chlorophenol degradation efficiency. Density functional theory calculations results demonstrate that in contrast to Co and Ni single&#8208;atom sites, the Fe&#8208;N4  sites in Fe1/CN adsorb the terminal O of PMS, which can facilitate the oxidization of PMS to form SO5&#8226;&#8208;, and thereafter efficiently generate  1O2  with 100% selectivity. In addition, the Fe1/CN exhibits strong resistance to inorganic ions, natural organic matter, and pH value during the degradation of organic pollutants in the presence of PMS. This work develops a novel catalyst for the 100% selective production of  1O2  for highly selective and efficient degradation of pollutants.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly efficient CO2 electroreduction to methanol via atomically dispersed Sn coupled with defective CuO catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using renewable electricity to drive CO  2  electroreduction is an attractive way to achieve carbon&#8208;neutral energy cycle and produce value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels. As an important platform molecule and clean fuel, methanol requires 6&#8208;electron transfer in the process of CO  2  reduction. Currently, CO  2  electroreduction to methanol suffers from poor efficiency and low selectivity. Herein, we report the first work to design atomically dispersed Sn site anchored on defective CuO catalysts for CO  2  electroreduction to methanol. It exhibits high methanol Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 88.6% with a current density of 67.0 mA cm  &#8208;2  and remarkable stability in a H&#8208;cell, which is the highest FE(methanol) with such high current density compared with the results reported to date. The atomic Sn site, adjacent oxygen vacancy and CuO support cooperate very well, leading to higher double&#8208;layer capacitance, larger CO  2  adsorption capacity and lower interfacial charge transfer resistance. Operando experiments and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the catalyst is beneficial for CO  2  activation  via  decreasing the energy barrier of *COOH dissociation to form *CO. The obtained key intermediate *CO is then bound to the Cu species for further reduction, leading to high selectivity toward methanol.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring the Local Environment of Platinum&#160;in Single&#8208;Atom Pt1/CeO2 Catalysts for Robust Low&#8208;Temperature CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom Pt  1  /CeO  2  catalyst by atom trapping (AT, 800  o  C in air) shows excellent thermal stability, however, it is inactive for CO oxidation at low temperatures due to over&#8208;stabilization of Pt  2+  in a highly symmetric square&#8208;planar Pt  1  O  4  coordination. Reductive activation forming Pt nanoparticles (NPs) results in enhanced activity, however, NPs are easily oxidized leading to drastic activity loss. Here we show that tailoring the local environment of isolated Pt  2+  via thermal&#8208;shock (TS) synthesis leads to a highly active and thermally stable Pt  1  /CeO  2  catalyst. Ultrafast shockwaves (&gt; 1200  o  C) in an inert atmosphere induce surface reconstruction of CeO  2  , generating Pt single atoms in an asymmetric Pt  1  O  4  configuration. Originating from this unique coordination, Pt  1  &#948;+  in a partially reduced state dynamically evolved during CO oxidation, resulting in an exceptional low&#8208;temperature performance. The CO oxidation reactivity on the Pt  1  /CeO  2  _TS catalyst is retained under oxidizing conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>A New and Efficient Diazirine Based Four&#8208;armed Cross&#8208;linker for Photo&#8208;patterning of Polymeric Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of photo&#8208;patterning method is critical for all&#8208;solution fabrication of integrated electronic devices based on organic/polymeric semiconductors. In this paper, we report a new diazirine based four&#8208;armed cross&#8208;linker (  4CNN  ) with a tetrahedron geometry for efficient patterning of polymeric semiconductors by photo&#8208;induced carbene insertion reaction. After blending of  4  CNN  with no more than 3% (w/w), photo&#8208;patterning of  p  &#8208;,  n  &#8208; and ambipolar semiconducting polymers with side alkyl chains was successfully achieved, and regular patterns with size as small as 5 &#181;m were prepared easily with the aid of appropriate photomasks after UV (365 nm) light irradiation for just 40 s. Remarkably, the interchain packing order and the thin film morphology were nearly unaltered after the cross&#8208;linking. As a consequence, the semiconducting properties of the patterned thin films were mostly retained. By taking the advantage of the fact that the cross&#8208;linked thin films are robust and show good resistance to organic solvents, a complementary&#8208;like inverter with a gain value of 112 was constructed easily by two steps of photo&#8208;patterning of the  p  &#8208;type and  n  &#8208;type semiconducting polymers. These results demonstrate that  4CNN  is a new generation of cross&#8208;linker for the photo&#8208;patterning of polymeric semiconductors, and hold great potentials for all&#8208;solution processible flexible electronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>4&#8208;Selective Pyridine Alkylation via Wittig Olefination of Dearomatized Pyridylphosphonium Ylides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methods to synthesize alkylated pyridines are valuable because these structures are prevalent in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. We have developed a distinct approach to construct 4&#8208;alkylpyridines using dearomatized pyridylphosphonium ylide intermediates in a Wittig olefination&#8208;rearomatization sequence. Pyridine  N  &#8208;activation is key to this strategy, and  N&#8208;  triazinylpyridinium salts enable coupling between a wide variety of substituted pyridines and aldehydes. The alkylation protocol is viable for late&#8208;stage functionalization, including methylation of pyridine&#8208;containing drugs. This approach represents an alternative to metal&#8208;catalyzed  sp  2  &#8208;  sp  3  cross&#8208;coupling reactions and Minisci&#8208;type processes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Replacement of the allylic C=C&#8722;C unit with a N&#8211;B&#8211;N unit at each of the three zigzag edges of [4]triangulene gives rise to B  3  N  6  &#8208;[4]triangulene, which is envisioned to represent a key structural unit of a new hypothetical boron carbon nitride (BC  4  N). A  tert  &#8208;butylated B  3  N  6  &#8208;[4]triangulene has been successfully synthesized by three&#8208;fold nitrogen&#8208;directed borylation, and the X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis indicates that its slightly bent triangular polycyclic framework can be viewed as a 1,3,5&#8208;triphenylbenzene connected by three 4&#960;&#8208;electron N&#8722;B&#8722;N units. The HN&#8211;B&#8211;NH moiety provides a dual hydrogen&#8208;bond donor, which forms H&#8208;bonds with halide or carboxylate anions in solution, and form DD&#8208;AA hydrogen&#8208;bond arrays with 2,7&#8208;di(  tert  &#8208;butyl)&#8208;pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone in the co&#8208;crystal.

         <dc:description>In this work, a new kind of butterfly&#8208;like molecules of oxacalix[2]arene[2]pyrazine (OAP) are reported, which exhibit typical characteristics of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) via the restriction of intramolecular vibration (RIV) mechanism. Unlike any of the reported RIV&#8208;type AIE molecules, the synthetic procedures of which are complicated and associated high costs,  OAP  AIEgens can be synthesized in a facile manner by a one&#8208;step catalyst&#8208;free reaction using commercially available materials. Notably,  OAP  AIEgens are ideal ligands for constructing metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) due to their built&#8208;in coordination sites of pyrazine groups.  OAP&#8208;based MOFs exhibit multiple potential applications in reversible gas response, encrypted information storage, and construction of white light&#8208;emitting devices. This work enriches limited kinds of RIV&#8208;type AIEgens, offers additional selections of bridging ligands for constructing luminescent MOFs and provides a visualized prototype to understand the effect of RIV process on the luminescence property of MOFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Heterocycles via Oxidant&#8208;Free Dehydrocyclization of Alcohols Using Heterogeneous Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarizes recent developments in which both noble and non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts are used to synthesize N&#8208;heterocycles from alcohols and N&#8208;nucleophiles via acceptorless dehydrogenation or borrowing hydrogen methodologies. The strategies for the preparation and functionalization of heterogeneous catalysts, reaction mechanisms, and the roles of heterogeneous catalysts in these reactions are also discussed.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocycles, such as pyrroles, pyrimidines, quinazolines, and quinoxalines, are important building blocks for organic chemistry and the fine&#8208;chemical industry. For their synthesis, catalytic borrowing hydrogen and acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling reactions of alcohols as sustainable reagents have received significant attention in recent years. To overcome the problems of product separation and catalyst reusability, several metal&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts have been reported to achieve these transformations with good yields and selectivity. In this Minireview, we summarize recent developments using both noble and non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts to synthesize N&#8208;heterocycles from alcohols and N&#8208;nucleophiles via acceptorless dehydrogenation or borrowing hydrogen methodologies. Furthermore, this Minireview introduces strategies for the preparation and functionalization of the corresponding heterogeneous catalysts, discusses the reaction mechanisms and the roles of metal electronic states, and the influence of support Lewis acid&#8211;base properties on these reactions.

         <title>Cyclic Amplification of the Afterglow Luminescent Nanoreporter Enables the Prediction of Anti&#8208;cancer Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic afterglow luminescent nanoreporter (PFODBT@CPPO) is developed for visualizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and predicting immunogenic cell death during ROS&#8208;mediated cancer therapy. The thiophene&#8208;based afterglow luminescent nanoplatform is important to develop novel afterglow luminescent materials and provide instant information to avoid adverse immune responses.







Abstract
We developed a cyclic amplification method for an organic afterglow nanoreporter for the real&#8208;time visualization of self&#8208;generated reactive oxygen species (ROS). We promoted semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (PFODBT) as a candidate for emitting near&#8208;infrared afterglow luminescence. Introduction of a chemiluminescent substrate (CPPO) into PFODBT (PFODBT@CPPO) resulted in a significant enhancement of afterglow intensity through the dual cyclic amplification pathway involving singlet oxygen (1O2). 1O2 produced by PFODBT@CPPO induced cancer cell necrosis and promoted the release of damage&#8208;related molecular patterns, thereby evoking immunogenic cell death (ICD)&#8208;associated immune responses through ROS&#8208;based oxidative stress. The afterglow luminescent signals of the nanoreporter were well correlated with light&#8208;driven 1O2 generation and anti&#8208;cancer efficiency. This imaging strategy provides a non&#8208;invasive tool for predicting the therapeutic outcome that occurs during ROS&#8208;mediated cancer therapy.

         <title>Ultrafast Water Transport in Two&#8208;Dimensional Channels Enabled by Spherical Polyelectrolyte Brushes with Controllable Flexibility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast and high&#8208;efficiency water transport behaviour in 2D GO confined spacing assisted by spherical polyelectrolyte brushes can be easily realized. Further studies revealed that the water transport capacity was not only dependent on the hydrophilicity of the polyelectrolyte chains but also influenced by their flexibility in the solvent.







Abstract
Fast water transport channels are crucial for water&#8208;related membrane separation processes. However, overcoming the trade&#8208;off between flux and selectivity is still a major challenge. To address this, we constructed spherical polyelectrolyte brush (SPB) structures with a highly hydrophilic polyelectrolyte brush layer, and introduced them into GO laminates, which increased both the flux and the separation factor. At 70&#8201;&#176;C, the flux reached 5.23&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1, and the separation factor of butanol/water increased to &#8776;8000, which places it among the most selective separation membranes reported to date. Interestingly, further studies demonstrated that the enhancement of water transport was not only dependent on the hydrophilicity of the polyelectrolyte chains, but also influenced by their flexibility in the solvent. Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation and molecular dynamics simulations revealed the structure&#8208;performance correlations between water molecule migration and the flexibility of the ordered polymer chains in the 2D confined space.

         <title>Exploring the Druggability of Conserved RNA Regulatory Elements in the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Genome</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The RNA genome of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 contains 15 independently folded regulatory RNA elements. By NMR&#8208;based fragment screening, the RNA target space for small molecule binding, functional mapping and inhibition is defined.







Abstract
SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 contains a positive single&#8208;stranded RNA genome of approximately 30&#8201;000 nucleotides. Within this genome, 15 RNA elements were identified as conserved between SARS&#8208;CoV and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. By nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we previously determined that these elements fold independently, in line with data from in vivo and ex&#8208;vivo structural probing experiments. These elements contain non&#8208;base&#8208;paired regions that potentially harbor ligand&#8208;binding pockets. Here, we performed an NMR&#8208;based screening of a poised fragment library of 768 compounds for binding to these RNAs, employing three different 1H&#8208;based 1D NMR binding assays. The screening identified common as well as RNA&#8208;element specific hits. The results allow selection of the most promising of the 15 RNA elements as putative drug targets. Based on the identified hits, we derive key functional units and groups in ligands for effective targeting of the RNA of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

         <title>Porous 2D and 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks with Dimensionality&#8208;Dependent Photocatalytic Activity in Promoting Radical Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D and 3D N,N&#8208;diaryl dihydrophenazine (PN)&#8208;based COFs are prepared and used as heterogeneous photocatalysts to promote radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization (RROP) of vinylcyclopropanes (VCPs). The 2D COFs had higher catalytic activity and showed dimensionality&#8208;dependent photocatalytic activity, allowing the efficient synthesis of poly(VCPs) with controlled molecular weight, low dispersity and high l/c selectivity (up to 97&#8201;%).







Abstract
Dimensionality is a fundamental parameter to modulate the properties of solid materials by tuning electronic structures. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a prominent class of porous crystalline materials, but the study of dimensional dependence on their physicochemical properties is still lacking. Herein we illustrate photocatalytic performances of N,N&#8208;diaryl dihydrophenazine (PN)&#8208;based COFs are heavily dependent on the structural dimensionality. Six isostructural imine&#8208;bonded 2D&#8208;PN COFs and one 3D&#8208;PN COF were prepared. All can be heterogeneous photocatalysts to promote radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization of vinylcyclopropanes (VCPs), which typically produces polymers with a combination of linear (l) and cyclic (c) repeat units. The 2D&#8208;PN COFs have much higher catalytic activity than the 3D&#8208;PN COF, allowing the efficient synthesis of poly(VCPs) with controlled molecular weight, low dispersity and high l/c selectivity (up to 97&#8201;%). The improved performance can be ascribed to the 2D structure which has a larger internal surface area, more catalytically active sites, higher photosensitizing ability and photoinduced electron transfer efficiency.

         <title>Unravelling the Hydration Barrier of Lignin Oleate Nanoparticles for Acid&#8208; and Base&#8208;Catalyzed Functionalization in Dispersion State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lignin oleate nanoparticles (OLNPs) are demonstrated for functionalization in aqueous dispersion under acidic (pH&#8197;2) and basic (pH&#8197;12) conditions owing to the hydration barrier effect provided by oleic acid chains in the shells of OLNPs. Covalent functionalization of these nanoparticles using robust chemistries opens new avenues such as functional anticorrosive coatings and pH&#8208;switchable adsorbents for removal of organic dyes from wastewater.







Abstract
Lignin nanoparticles (LNPs) are promising renewable nanomaterials with applications ranging from biomedicine to water purification. However, the instability of LNPs under acidic and basic conditions severely limits their functionalization for improved performance. Here, we show that controlling the degree of esterification can significantly improve the stability of lignin oleate nanoparticles (OLNPs) in acidic and basic aqueous dispersions. The high stability of OLNPs is attributed to the alkyl chains accumulated in the shell of the particle, which delays protonation/deprotonation of carboxylic acid and phenolic hydroxyl groups. Owing to the enhanced stability, acid&#8208; and base&#8208;catalyzed functionalization of OLNPs at pH&#8197;2.0 and pH&#8197;12.0 via oxirane ring&#8208;opening reactions were successfully performed. We also demonstrated these new functionalized particles as efficient pH&#8208;switchable dye adsorbents and anticorrosive particulate coatings.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Pyridines with All&#8208;Carbon Quaternary Carbon Centers via Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetric [2+2+2] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective synthesis of pyridines with all&#8208;carbon quaternary carbon centers has been developed by cobalt&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition of alkyne&#8208;bearing malononitrile and terminal alkynes using a desymmetrization strategy. The regioselectivity of pyridine is controlled by the inherent nature of terminal alkynes and the substituents on the bisoxazolinephosphine ligands.







Abstract
A Co&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective desymmetric [2+2+2] cycloaddition for synthesis of pyridines with all&#8208;carbon quaternary carbon centers has been developed. The regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities are controlled by the inherent nature of terminal alkynes and the substituents on the bisoxazolinephosphine ligands. Pyridines with 5&#8208;substitutents could be obtained with &gt;20:1 regioselectivity and up to 94&#8201;% ee when terminal alkyl, alkenyl or silyl alkynes and DTBM/Ph&#8208;based NPN* ligand L6 were used. Terminal aryl alkynes and Ph/Bn&#8208;based ligand L4 leads to formation of pyridines with 6&#8208;substitutents in up to 99&#8201;% ee.

         <title>BODIPY&#8208;Based Photodynamic Agents for Exclusively Generating Superoxide Radical over Singlet Oxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY)&#8208;based photosensitizers generate ROS exclusively by the Type&#8208;I process upon near&#8208;infrared light illumination for tumor ablation.







Abstract
Developing Type&#8208;I photosensitizers is considered as an efficient approach to overcome the deficiency of traditional photodynamic therapy (PDT) for hypoxic tumors. However, it remains a challenge to design photosensitizers for generating reactive oxygen species by the Type&#8208;I process. Herein, we report a series of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;linked BODIPY dimers and a trimer that exclusively generate superoxide radical (O2&#8722;.) by the Type&#8208;I process upon light irradiation. The triplet formation originates from an effective excited&#8208;state relaxation from the initially populated singlet (S1) to triplet (T1) states via an intermediate triplet (T2) state. The low reduction potential and ultralong lifetime of the T1 state facilitate the efficient generation of O2&#8722;. by inter&#8208;molecular charge transfer to molecular oxygen. The energy gap of T1&#8208;S0 is smaller than that between 3O2 and 1O2 thereby precluding the generation of singlet oxygen by the Type&#8208;II process. The trimer exhibits superior PDT performance under the hypoxic environment.

         <title>Enzymatic Tailoring in Luzopeptin Biosynthesis Involves Cytochrome&#8197;P450&#8208;Mediated Carbon&#8211;Nitrogen Bond Desaturation for Hydrazone Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luzopeptins are potent antitumor and antiviral agents with their biological activities controlled by rare modified tetrahydropyridazine structural subunits. Reconstitution of the tailoring pathway in luzopeptin&#8197;A biosynthesis reveals the molecular basis of this key pharmacophore formation, which involves unusual carbon&#8211;nitrogen bond desaturation by multitasking cytochrome&#8197;P450 and extracellular O&#8208;acetylation by integral membrane acyltransferase.







Abstract
Luzopeptins and related decadepsipeptides are bisintercalator nonribosomal peptides featuring rare acyl&#8208;substituted tetrahydropyridazine&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acid (Thp) subunits that are critical to their biological activities. Herein, we reconstitute the biosynthetic tailoring pathway in luzopeptin&#8197;A biosynthesis through in vivo genetic and in vitro biochemical approaches. Significantly, we revealed a multitasking cytochrome&#8197;P450 enzyme that catalyzes four consecutive oxidations including the highly unusual carbon&#8211;nitrogen bond desaturation, forming the hydrazone&#8208;bearing 4&#8208;OH&#8208;Thp residues. Moreover, we identified a membrane&#8208;bound acyltransferase that likely mediates the subsequent O&#8208;acetylation extracellularly, as a potential self&#8208;protective strategy for the producer strain. Further genome mining of novel decadepsipeptides and an associated P450 enzyme have provided mechanistic insights into the P450&#8208;mediated carbon&#8211;nitrogen bond desaturation. Our results not only reveal the molecular basis of pharmacophore formation in bisintercalator decadepsipeptides, but also expand the catalytic versatility of P450 family enzymes.

Abstract
An iridium&#8208;catalyzed reductive three&#8208;component coupling reaction for the synthesis of medicinally relevant &#945;&#8208;amino 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazoles from abundant tertiary amides or lactams, carboxylic acids, and (N&#8208;isocyanimino) triphenylphosphorane, is described. Proceeding under mild conditions using (&lt;1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) Vaska's complex (IrCl(CO)(PPh3)2) and tetramethyldisiloxane to access the key reactive iminium ion intermediates, a broad range of &#945;&#8208;amino 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole architectures were accessed from carboxylic acid feedstock coupling partners. Extension to &#945;&#8208;amino heterodiazole synthesis was readily achieved by exchanging the carboxylic acid coupling partner for C&#8208;, S&#8208;, or N&#8208;centered Br&#248;nsted acids, and provided rapid and modular access to these desirable, yet difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access, heterocycles. The high chemoselectivity of the catalytic reductive activation step allowed late&#8208;stage functionalization of 10 drug molecules, including the synthesis of heterodiazole&#8208;fused drug&#8211;drug conjugates.

A method is described for the isomerization of acyclic allylic alcohols into &#946;&#8208;functionalized ketones via 1,3&#8208;alkyl transposition. This reaction proceeds via light&#8208;driven proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) activation of the O&#8722;H bond in an allylic alcohol substrate, followed by C&#8722;C &#946;&#8208;scission of the resulting alkoxy radical to form an enone and an alkyl radical that may recombine via radical conjugate addition.

The transient alkyl radical and enone acceptor generated in the scission event subsequently recombine via radical conjugate addition to deliver &#946;&#8208;functionalized ketone products. A variety of allylic alcohol substrates bearing alkyl and acyl migratory groups were successfully accommodated. Insights from mechanistic studies led to a modified reaction protocol that improves reaction performance for challenging substrates.

&lt;p&gt;A method is described for the isomerization of acyclic allylic alcohols into &#946;-functionalized ketones via 1,3-alkyl transposition. This reaction proceeds via light-driven proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) activation of the O&#8722;H bond in the allylic alcohol substrate, followed by C&#8722;C &#946;-scission of the resulting alkoxy radical. The transient alkyl radical and enone acceptor generated in the scission event subsequently recombine via radical conjugate addition to deliver &#946;-functionalized ketone products. A variety of allylic alcohol substrates bearing alkyl and acyl migratory groups were successfully accommodated. Insights from mechanistic studies led to a modified reaction protocol that improves reaction performance for challenging substrates.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Configuration Sampling With Five&#8208;Membered Atropisomeric P,N&#8208;Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The utility of a small series of atropisomeric, C1&#8208;symmetric P,N&#8208;ligands that incrementally change the position of the groups within the chiral pocket is reported. This enables sampling of chiral space without modifying the steric parameters of the substituents. As a demonstration of the utility, using this small series of stack ligands, a P,N ligand was identified for the enantioselective &#946;&#8208;borylation of Michael acceptors.







Abstract
Here we report a strategy for the systematic variation of atropisomeric C1&#8208;symmetric P,N ligands to incrementally change the position of the groups within the chiral pocket without modifying their steric parameters. More specifically, the effects of systematic modification of the nitrogen heterocycle in atropisomeric C1&#8208;symmetric stack ligands have been investigated in this study. The versatility and applicability of this approach has been demonstrated in mechanistically distinct catalytic enantioselective transformations, resulting in the identification of a P,N&#8208;ligand for a highly enantioselective synthesis of organoboranes.

         <title>Crystalline Sponge Method: X&#8208;ray Structure Analysis of Small Molecules by Post&#8208;Orientation within Porous Crystals&#8212;Principle and Proof&#8208;of&#8208;Concept Studies</title>

         <dc:description>
Crystal growth is not needed for single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis when the crystalline sponge method is used. This method makes use of single&#8208;crystalline porous coordination networks (&#8220;crystalline sponges&#8221;) that can absorb small guest molecules within the pores and make the absorbed guests observable by conventional single&#8208;crystal diffraction. This Review focuses on the principles of this approach as well as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies.







Abstract
This Review discusses, along with the historical background, the principles as well as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies of the crystalline sponge (CS) method, a new single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) method for the analysis of the structures of small molecules without sample crystallization. The method uses single&#8208;crystalline porous coordination networks (crystalline sponges) that can absorb small guest molecules within their pores. The absorbed guest molecules are ordered in the pores through molecular recognition and become observable by conventional SCXRD analysis. The complex {[(ZnI2)3(tpt)2]&#8901;x(solvent)}n (tpt=tris(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine) was first proposed as a crystalline sponge and has been most generally used. Crystalline sponges developed later are also discussed here. The principle of the CS method can be described as &#8220;post&#8208;crystallization&#8221; of the absorbed guest, whose ordering is templated by the pre&#8208;latticed cavities. The method has been widely applied to synthetic chemistry as well as natural product studies, for which proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept examples will be shown here.

         <title>Dynamic Catalytic Highly Enantioselective 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselectively catalyzed dynamic covalent one&#8208;pot&#8208;tandem 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of azomethine ylides to &#945;&#8242;&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;2&#8208;cyclopentenones is described. Time&#8208;dependend enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent synthesis was achieved by using the same set of reagents. A reversible cycloaddition of the kinetically favored product enables the interconversion to its more stable thermodynamically favored product through a chiral complex&#8208;mediated process.







Abstract
In dynamic covalent chemistry, reactions follow a thermodynamically controlled pathway through equilibria. Reversible covalent&#8208;bond formation and breaking in a dynamic process enables the interconversion of products formed under kinetic control to thermodynamically more stable isomers. Notably, enantioselective catalysis of dynamic transformations has not been reported and applied in complex molecule synthesis. We describe the discovery of dynamic covalent enantioselective metal&#8208;complex&#8208;catalyzed 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions. We have developed a stereodivergent tandem synthesis of structurally and stereochemically complex molecules that generates eight stereocenters with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity through asymmetric reversible bond formation in a dynamic process in two consecutive Ag&#8208;catalyzed 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions of azomethine ylides with electron&#8208;poor olefins. Time&#8208;dependent reversible dynamic covalent&#8208;bond formation gives enantiodivergent and diastereodivergent access to structurally complex double cycloadducts with high selectivity from a common set of reagents.

A highly regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective cascade reaction of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds with 2&#8208;nitroindoles, 2&#8208;nitrobenzofurans and 2&#8208;nitrobenzothiophenes was achieved through dipeptide&#8208;phoaphonium salt catalysis. Three types of structurally fused heterocycles were obtained in excellent stereoselectivities. Regioselectivities were determined by the low reaction energy resulting from the initial &#945;&#8208;addition but not &#947;&#8208;addition.







Abstract
Chiral (dihydro)furo&#8208;fused heterocycles are significant structural motifs in numerous natural products, functional materials and pharmaceuticals. Therefore, developing efficient methods for preparing compounds with these privileged scaffolds is an important endeavor in synthetic chemistry. Herein, we develop an effective, modular method by a dipeptide&#8208;phosphonium salt&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and stereoselective cascade reaction of readily available linear &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones with aromatic alkenes, affording a wide variety of structurally fused heterocyclic molecules in high yields with excellent stereoselectivities. Moreover, mechanistic investigations revealed that the bifunctional phosphonium salt controlled the regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities of this cascade reaction, particularly proceeding through the initial ketone &#945;&#8208;addition followed by O&#8208;participated substitution; and the multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between Br&#248;nsted acid moieties of catalyst and nitro group of aromatic alkene were crucial in asymmetric induction. Given the generality, versatility, and high efficiency of this method, we anticipate that it will have broad synthetic utilities.

         <title>Intermolecular [5+2] Annulation between 1&#8208;Indanones and Internal Alkynes by Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8211;C Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Rh&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular [5+2] annulation between 1&#8208;indanones and alkynes is reported. It provides a rapid and straightforward entry to benzocycloheptenones. DFT calculation reveals the beneficial &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between the ligand and the substrate in the turnover&#8208;limiting migration insertion step.







Abstract
Herein, we report a [5+2] cycloaddition between readily accessible 1&#8208;indanones and internal alkynes through Rh&#8208;catalyzed activation of less strained C&#8722;C bonds. The reaction is enabled by a strongly &#963;&#8208;donating NHC ligand and a carefully modified temporary directing group. A wide range of functional groups is tolerated, and the method provides straightforward access to diverse benzocycloheptenones that are hard to access otherwise. DFT studies of the reaction mechanism imply the migration insertion as the turnover&#8208;limiting step and suggest beneficial &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions in the transition states.

DFT studies of the reaction mechanism imply the migration insertion as the turnover-limiting step and suggest beneficial &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions in the transition states.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Temporal Control over Two&#8208; and Three&#8208;State Living Coordinative Chain Transfer Polymerization for Modulating the Molecular Weight Distribution Profile of Polyolefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design and successful demonstration of a highly versatile new strategy for manipulating the molecular weight distribution profiles of a variety of different polyolefins is reported. It involves temporal control over two&#8208; and three&#8208;state living coordinative chain transfer polymerization (LCCTP) of olefins in a programmable way.







Abstract
A highly versatile new strategy for manipulating the molecular weight profiles, including breadth, asymmetry (skewness) and modal nature (mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, and multimodal), of a variety of different polyolefins is reported. It involves temporal control over two&#8208; and three&#8208;state living coordinative chain transfer polymerization (LCCTP) of olefins in a programmable way. By changing the identity of the R&#8242; groups of the chain transfer agent, ER&#8242;n, with time, different populations of chains within a bi&#8208; or multimodal polyolefin product can be selectively tagged with different end&#8208;groups. By changing the nature of the main&#8208;group metal of the CTA, programmed manipulation of the relative magnitudes of the dispersities of the different maxima that make up the final MWD profile can be achieved. This strategy can be implemented with existing LCCTP materials and conventional reactor methods to provide access to scalable and practical quantities of an unlimited array of new polyolefin materials.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Highly Selective Protoboration of CF3&#8208;Containing 1,3&#8208;Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel copper&#8208;catalyzed protoboration of CF3&#8208;containing 1,3&#8208;dienes with proton source and B2Pin2 has been developed. This chemistry afforded the CF3&#8208;containing borated products with good selectivity and efficiency.







Abstract
The copper&#8208;catalyzed highly selective protoboration of CF3&#8208;containing conjugated diene with proton source and B2Pin2 has been developed. This chemistry could suppress the well&#8208;known defluorination and provide borated reagents with an intact CF3&#8208;group. Further studies indicated that the functional group tolerance of this chemistry is very well, and the products could be used as versatile precursors for different types of transformations. Importantly, using chiral diphosphine ligand, we have developed the first example for using such starting material to synthesis allylic boron&#8208;reagents which bearing a CF3&#8208;containing chiral center. Notably, the reaction mechanism was intensively studied by DFT calculations, which could reveal the reason that defluorination was inhibited.

         <title>A Mild Intermolecular Synthesis of Cyclopropane&#8208;Incorporated Tricyclic Skeleton: Unusual Reactivity of Isobenzopyryliums</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopropanes embedded in a polycyclic bridged architecture are a versatile structural motif, but such complex frameworks often impose substantial synthetic challenges. Herein we introduce a new approach for the expedient access to such spring&#8208;loaded strained systems via an exceptionally mild intermolecular convergent process between the readily available isobenzopyryliums and vinylboronic acids. Different from the typical conventional approaches, our protocol does not involve the highly active carbenoid intermediates or strong conditions in order to overcome the disfavored kinetic and thermodynamic problems. Instead, the key cyclopropane ring was formed between the well&#8208;positioned nucleophile and electrophile in the adduct from the regioselective [4+2] cycloaddition. Thus, this unusual process also represents a new reactivity of the versatile isobenzopyryliums. The choice of a Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst with proper acidity is crucial to the high efficiency and selectivity for this multiple bond&#8208;forming process. The strained products are precursors to other useful synthetic building blocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Charge Transfer from Donor to Acceptor in Conjugated Microporous Polymer for Enhanced Photosensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photosensitization associated with light absorption and energy/electron&#8208;transfer represents the central processes for photosynthesis. However, it&#8217;s still a great challenge to develop heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free (HAF) strategy to improve the sensitizing ability of polymeric photosensitizers. Herein, we propose a new protocol to significantly improve the photosensitization by decorating mother conjugated microporous polymer (CMP&#8208;1) with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), resulting in a series of CMPs (CMP&#8208;2&#8208;4). Systematic study reveals that covalent modification with PAHs can transfer charge to Bodipy in CMP to further facilitate both intersystem crossing and electron&#8208;hole separation, which can dramatically boost energy&#8208;/electron&#8208;transfer reactions. Remarkably, CMP&#8208;2 as a representative CMP can efficiently drive the photosynthesis of methyl phenyl sulfoxide with 92% yield, substantially higher than that of CMP&#8208;1 (32%). Experiments and theory calculations demonstrate the structure&#8208;property&#8208;activity relationship of these CMPs, opening a new horizon for developing HAF heterogeneous photosensitizers with highly efficient sensitizing activity by rational structure regulation at a molecular level.</dc:description>

However, it&#8217;s still a great challenge to develop heavy-atom-free (HAF) strategy to improve the sensitizing ability of polymeric photosensitizers. Herein, we propose a new protocol to significantly improve the photosensitization by decorating mother conjugated microporous polymer (CMP-1) with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), resulting in a series of CMPs (CMP-2-4). Systematic study reveals that covalent modification with PAHs can transfer charge to Bodipy in CMP to further facilitate both intersystem crossing and electron-hole separation, which can dramatically boost energy-/electron-transfer reactions.

         <title>AgII&#8208;Mediated Electrocatalytic Ambient CH4 Functionalization Inspired by HSAB Theory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18152-18161, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the HSAB theory, we explored the electrocatalytic CH4 functionalization mediated by AgII metalloradical, the last class (b) transition metal whose reactivity towards CH4 is unknown. Detailed mechanistic investigation unveils a low activation energy of 13.1&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and a high pseudo&#8208;first&#8208;order rate constant of CH4 activation up to 2.8&#215;103&#8197;h&#8722;1 at room temperature.







Abstract
Although most class (b) transition metals have been studied in regard to CH4 activation, divalent silver (AgII), possibly owing to its reactive nature, is the only class (b) high&#8208;valent transition metal center that is not yet reported to exhibit reactivities towards CH4 activation. We now report that electrochemically generated AgII metalloradical readily functionalizes CH4 into methyl bisulfate (CH3OSO3H) at ambient conditions in 98&#8201;% H2SO4. Mechanistic investigation experimentally unveils a low activation energy of 13.1&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, a high pseudo&#8208;first&#8208;order rate constant of CH4 activation up to 2.8&#215;103&#8197;h&#8722;1 at room temperature and a CH4 pressure of 85&#8197;psi, and two competing reaction pathways preferable towards CH4 activation over solvent oxidation. Reaction kinetic data suggest a Faradaic efficiency exceeding 99&#8201;% beyond 180&#8197;psi CH4 at room temperature for potential chemical production from widely distributed natural gas resources with minimal infrastructure reliance.

         <title>Thermal Unequilibrium of PdSn Intermetallic Nanocatalysts: From In Situ Tailored Synthesis to Unexpected Hydrogenation Selectivity</title>

Metastable PdSn intermetallic nanoparticles are made through a rapid quenching method, inspired by in situ characterization results. PdSn shows unprecedented high hydrogenation selectivity of C=O over C=C bonds in &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes.







Abstract
Effective control on chemoselectivity in the catalytic hydrogenation of C=O over C=C bonds is uncommon with Pd&#8208;based catalysts because of the favored adsorption of C=C bonds on Pd surface. Here we report a unique orthorhombic PdSn intermetallic phase with unprecedented chemoselectivity toward C=O hydrogenation. We observed the formation and metastability of this PdSn phase in situ. During a natural cooling process, the PdSn nanoparticles readily revert to the favored Pd3Sn2 phase. Instead, using a thermal quenching method, we prepared a pure&#8208;phase PdSn nanocatalyst. PdSn shows an &gt;96&#8201;% selectivity toward hydrogenating C=O bonds of various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes, highest in reported Pd&#8208;based catalysts. Further study suggests that efficient quenching prevents the reversion from PdSn&#8208; to Pd3Sn2&#8208;structured surface, the key to the desired catalytic performance. Density functional theory calculations and analysis of reaction kinetics provide an explanation for the observed high selectivity.

         <title>Capture and Separation of SO2 Traces in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks via Pre&#8208;Synthetic Pore Environment Tailoring by Methyl Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 17998-18005, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pre&#8208;synthetic pore environment tailoring strategy has been applied to improve low&#8208;pressure SO2 affinity on stable isostructural methyl&#8208;functionalized MOFs by controlling methyl groups density. Enhanced low&#8208;pressure SO2 uptake and SO2 separation was achieved. This work provides a facile strategy to obtain tailor&#8208;made MOF adsorbents for challenging gas purification applications.







Abstract
Herein, we report a pre&#8208;synthetic pore environment design strategy to achieve stable methyl&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) for preferential SO2 binding and thus enhanced low (partial) pressure SO2 adsorption and SO2/CO2 separation. The enhanced sorption performance is for the first time attributed to an optimal pore size by increasing methyl group densities at the benzenedicarboxylate linker in [Ni2(BDC&#8208;X)2DABCO] (BDC&#8208;X=mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tetramethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate/terephthalate; DABCO=1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane). Monte Carlo simulations and first&#8208;principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate the key role of methyl groups within the pore surface on the preferential SO2 affinity over the parent MOF. The SO2 separation potential by methyl&#8208;functionalized MOFs has been validated by gas sorption isotherms, ideal adsorbed solution theory calculations, simulated and experimental breakthrough curves, and DFT calculations.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Binding&#8208;Initiated Activation of O&#8722;H Bonds on a Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Surface for the Catalytic Oxidation of Biomass Hydroxyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18103-18110, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#916;G0 value of on&#8208;surface hydrogen binding was obtained from the chemical&#8208;shift change of the involved protons and the variation of acceptor concentrations via NMR. This reflects the ability of the catalyst surface to form hydrogen bonds with hydroxyl groups. The on&#8208;surface hydrogen&#8208;binding was successfully employed to drive the initiated activation of O&#8722;H bonds in probing the oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural with Co&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts.







Abstract
Hydrogen binding of molecules on solid surfaces is an attractive interaction that can be used as the driving force for bond activation, material&#8208;directed assembly, protein protection, etc. However, the lack of a quantitative characterization method for hydrogen bonds (HBs) on surfaces seriously limits its application. We measured the standard Gibbs free energy change (&#916;G0) of on&#8208;surface HBs using NMR. The HB&#8208;accepting ability of the surface was investigated by comparing &#916;G0 values employing the model biomass platform 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural on a series of Co&#8208;N&#8208;C&#8208;n catalysts with adjustable electron&#8208;rich nitrogen&#8208;doped contents. Decreasing &#916;G0 improves the HB&#8208;accepting ability of the nitrogen&#8208;doped surface and promotes the selectively initiated activation of O&#8722;H bonds in the oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural. As a result, the reaction kinetics is accelerated. In addition to the excellent catalytic performance, the turnover frequency (TOF) for this oxidation is much higher than for reported non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal catalysts.

A highly reproducible, homogeneous plasmonic substrate was fabricated by electron&#8208;beam lithography to detect the Raman fingerprints of molecular self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) by surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) at all points of the substrate with high uniformity. This substrate was employed for characterizing the intermediates and the product of a solid&#8208;phase synthesis in a SAM by SERS.







Abstract
Nanopatterned surfaces enhance incident electromagnetic radiation and thereby enable the detection and characterization of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs), for instance in surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Herein, Au nanohole arrays, developed and characterized as SERS substrates, are exemplarily used for monitoring a solid&#8208;phase deprotection and a subsequent copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition &#8220;click&#8221; reaction, performed directly on the corresponding SAMs. The SERS substrate was found to be highly reliable in terms of signal reproducibility and chemical stability. Furthermore, the intermediates and the product of the solid&#8208;phase synthesis were identified by SERS. The spectra of the immobilized compounds showed minor differences compared to spectra of the microcrystalline solids. With its uniform SERS signals and the high chemical stability, the platform paves the way for monitoring molecular manipulations in surface functionalization applications.

         <title>One&#8208;Shot Intrablock Cross&#8208;Linking of Linear Diblock Copolymer to Realize Janus&#8208;Shaped Single&#8208;Chain Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18122-18128, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;shot intrablock cross&#8208;linking protocol was demonstrated to achieve a rapid and facile synthesis of single&#8208;chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) with two chemically compartmentalized domains (Janus&#8208;shaped SCNPs) from the various diblock copolymers bearing one particular cross&#8208;linkable functionality across the entire polymer chain. Janus&#8208;shaped SCNP produce significantly small microphase&#8208;separated structure.







Abstract
Developing an efficient and versatile process to transform a single linear polymer chain into a shape&#8208;defined nanoobject is a major challenge in the fields of chemistry and nanotechnology to replicate sophisticated biological functions of proteins and nucleic acids in a synthetic polymer system. In this study, we performed one&#8208;shot intrablock cross&#8208;linking of linear block copolymers (BCPs) to realize single&#8208;chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) with two chemically compartmentalized domains (Janus&#8208;shaped SCNPs). Detailed structural characterizations of the Janus&#8208;shaped SCNP composed of polystyrene&#8208;block&#8208;poly(glycolic acid) revealed its compactly folded conformation and compartmentalized block localization, similar to the self&#8208;folded tertiary structures of natural proteins. Versatility of the one&#8208;shot intrablock cross&#8208;linking was demonstrated using several different BCP precursors. In addition, the Janus&#8208;shaped SCNP produce miniscule microphase&#8208;separated structures.

&lt;p&gt;A one-shot intrablock cross-linking protocol was demonstrated to achieve a rapid and facile synthesis of single-chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) with two chemically compartmentalized domains (Janus-shaped SCNPs) from the various diblock copolymers bearing one particular cross-linkable functionality across the entire polymer chain. Janus-shaped SCNP produce significantly small microphase-separated structure.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing an efficient and versatile process to transform a single linear polymer chain into a shape-defined nanoobject is a major challenge in the fields of chemistry and nanotechnology to replicate sophisticated biological functions of proteins and nucleic acids in a synthetic polymer system. In this study, we performed one-shot intrablock cross-linking of linear block copolymers (BCPs) to realize single-chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) with two chemically compartmentalized domains (Janus-shaped SCNPs). Detailed structural characterizations of the Janus-shaped SCNP composed of polystyrene-block-poly(glycolic acid) revealed its compactly folded conformation and compartmentalized block localization, similar to the self-folded tertiary structures of natural proteins. Versatility of the one-shot intrablock cross-linking was demonstrated using several different BCP precursors. In addition, the Janus-shaped SCNP produce miniscule microphase-separated structures.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Direct Organocatalytic Enantioselective Route to Functionalized trans&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder Products Having the Norcarane Scaffold</title>

An asymmetric organocatalytic methodology for obtaining diverse trans&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder products with up to 86&#8201;% yield &gt;20:1 d.r. &gt;99&#8201;% ee and five stereocenters, of which one is a quaternary carbon, has been developed. This was achieved using a pseudo&#8208;halogen effect to increase reactivity and selectivity. An SN2&#8208;like substitution at a tertiary center transforms the fleeting cis&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder intermediate into the trans&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder product.







Abstract
An enantioselective methodology to construct trans&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder scaffolds by organocatalysis with excellent selectivity, high yield and up to five contiguous stereocenters is presented. The reaction concept integrates the halogen effect and a novel discovered pseudo&#8208;halogen effect to direct an endo&#8208;selective, secondary&#8208;amine catalyzed Diels&#8211;Alder reaction allowing for the subsequent formation of trans&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder cycloadducts featuring the norcarene scaffold. The methodology relies on the reaction between an in situ generated trienamine and an &#945;&#8208;brominated or &#945;&#8208;pseudo&#8208;halogenated enone to form a fleeting cis&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder intermediate. The endo&#8208;transition state&#8208;enhanced by the (pseudo&#8208;)halogen effect&#8208;sets the stereochemistry that allows for a subsequent SN2&#8208;like reaction at a tertiary center to obtain the trans&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder scaffold. The mechanism was investigated and supported by experimental results as well as computational studies.

Fe&#8208;HHTP&#8208;MOF, a unique cubic metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) comprising hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP) supertetrahedral units and FeIII ions arranged in a diamond topology is reported. Fe&#8208;HHTP&#8208;MOF is a highly crystalline, porous and deep black material featuring high electrical conductivity.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of a unique cubic metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), Fe&#8208;HHTP&#8208;MOF, comprising hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP) supertetrahedral units and FeIII ions, arranged in a diamond topology. The MOF is synthesized under solvothermal conditions, yielding a highly crystalline, deep black powder, with crystallites of 300&#8211;500&#8197;nm size and tetrahedral morphology. Nitrogen sorption analysis indicates a highly porous material with a surface area exceeding 1400&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1. Furthermore, Fe&#8208;HHTP&#8208;MOF shows broadband absorption from 475 up to 1900&#8197;nm with excellent absorption capability of 98.5&#8201;% of the incoming light over the visible spectral region. Electrical conductivity measurements of pressed pellets reveal a high intrinsic electrical conductivity of up to 10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1. Quantum mechanical calculations predict Fe&#8208;HHTP&#8208;MOF to be an efficient electron conductor, exhibiting continuous charge&#8208;carrier pathways throughout the structure.

         <title>Tricomponent Supramolecular Multiblock Copolymers with Tunable Composition via Sequential Seeded Growth</title>

Synthesis of tricomponent supramolecular block copolymers with tunable microstructure is demonstrated by a kinetically controlled sequential seeded supramolecular polymerization of fluorescent core&#8208;substituted naphthalenediimide derivatives.







Abstract
Synthesis of supramolecular block co&#8208;polymers (BCP) with small monomers and predictive sequence requires elegant molecular design and synthetic strategies. Herein we report the unparalleled synthesis of tri&#8208;component supramolecular BCPs with tunable microstructure by a kinetically controlled sequential seeded supramolecular polymerization of fluorescent &#960;&#8208;conjugated monomers. Core&#8208;substituted naphthalene diimide (cNDI) derivatives with different core substitutions and appended with &#946;&#8208;sheet forming peptide side chains provide perfect monomer design with spectral complementarity, pathway complexity and minimal structural mismatch to synthesize and characterize the multi&#8208;component BCPs. The distinct fluorescent nature of various cNDI monomers aids the spectroscopic probing of the seeded growth process and the microscopic visualization of resultant supramolecular BCPs using Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM). Kinetically controlled sequential seeded supramolecular polymerization presented here is reminiscent of the multi&#8208;step synthesis of covalent BCPs via living chain polymerization. These findings provide a promising platform for constructing unique functional organic heterostructures for various optoelectronic and catalytic applications.

         <title>Highly Selective CO2 Conversion to Methanol in a Bifunctional Zeolite Catalytic Membrane Reactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18289-18294, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional catalytic membrane reactor is developed for CO2 conversion to methanol, in which CO2 conversion to methanol and the by&#8208;product water removal by hydrophilic zeolite LTA membrane is realized simultaneously. Attributing to in situ and continuous removal of water from the reaction system, the equilibrium limitation of CO2 conversion to methanol is broken, leading to a significant enhancement of CO2 conversion and methanol selectivity.







Abstract
The hydrogenation of sequestrated CO2 to methanol can reduce CO2 emission and establish a sustainable carbon circuit. However, the transformation of CO2 into methanol is challenging because of the thermodynamic equilibrium limitation and the deactivation of catalysts by water. In the present work, different reactor types have been evaluated for CO2 catalytic hydrogenation to methanol. Best results have been obtained in a bifunctional catalytic membrane reactor (CMR) based on a zeolite LTA membrane and a catalytic Cu&#8208;ZnO&#8208;Al2O3&#8208;ZrO2 layer on top. Due to the in situ and rapid removal of the produced water from the catalytic layer through the hydrophilic zeolite LTA membrane, it is effective to break the thermodynamic equilibrium limitation, thus significantly increasing the CO2 conversion (36.1&#8201;%) and methanol selectivity (100&#8201;%). Further, the catalyst deactivation by the produced water can be effectively inhibited, thus maintaining a high long&#8208;term activity of the CMR.

Parallel, automated, and practical multicomponent reaction synthesis of high diversity acrylamides/ester libraries and HT protein crystallography (PX) yielded potent covalent inhibitors of the main protease of the COVID&#8208;19 causing agent SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. More general, integration of HT PX and HT synthesis into the &#8220;design&#8208;make&#8208;test&#8208;analyze&#8221; cycle will open unprecedented horizons in medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
Protein crystallography (PX) is widely used to drive advanced stages of drug optimization or to discover medicinal chemistry starting points by fragment soaking. However, recent progress in PX could allow for a more integrated role into early drug discovery. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the interplay of high throughput synthesis and high throughput PX. We describe a practical multicomponent reaction approach to acrylamides and &#8208;esters from diverse building blocks suitable for mmol scale synthesis on 96&#8208;well format and on a high&#8208;throughput nanoscale format in a highly automated fashion. High&#8208;throughput PX of our libraries efficiently yielded potent covalent inhibitors of the main protease of the COVID&#8208;19 causing agent, SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Our results demonstrate, that the marriage of in situ HT synthesis of (covalent) libraires and HT PX has the potential to accelerate hit finding and to provide meaningful strategies for medicinal chemistry projects.

         <title>Synergistic Polarization Engineering on Bulk and Surface for Boosting CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18303-18308, August 9, 2021. </description>

Synergistic polarization engineering on bulk and on the surface of Bi4Ti3O12 is realized by coupling corona poling and surface I&#8208;grafting, which strengthen ferroelectric polarization for facilitating the separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers and enrich the reactive sites, largely improving the photocatalytic activity for reducing CO2 into CO.







Abstract
Sluggish charge kinetics and low CO2 affinity seriously inhibit CO2 photoreduction. Herein, the synchronous promotion of charge separation and CO2 affinity of Bi4Ti3O12 is realized by coupling corona poling and surface I&#8208;grafting. Corona poling enhances ferroelectric polarization of Bi4Ti3O12 by aligning the domains direction, which profoundly promotes charge transfer along opposite directions across bulk. Surface I&#8208;grafting forms a surface local electric field for further separating charge carriers and provides abundant active sites to enhance CO2 adsorption. The two modifications cooperatively further increase the ferroelectric polarization of Bi4Ti3O12, which maximize the separation efficiency of photogenerated charges, resulting in an enhanced CO production rate of 15.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 (nearly 9 times) with no sacrificial agents or cocatalysts. This work discloses that ferroelectric polarization and surface ion grafting can promote CO2 photoreduction in a synergistic way.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Directed Modification of Active Matrix Metalloproteases: Activity&#8208;based Probes with no Photolabile Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18272-18279, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activity&#8208;based probes have been designed that react with matrix metalloproteases active sites without any external trigger. These phosphinic pseudo peptide probes displayed a preference for human matrix metalloelastase hMMP&#8208;12 and were capable of selectively labelling human and mouse MMP&#8208;12 in complex proteomes.







Abstract
Activity&#8208;based probes enable discrimination between the active enzyme and its inactive or inactivated counterparts. Since metalloproteases catalysis is non&#8208;covalent, activity&#8208;based probes targeting them have been systematically developed by decorating reversible inhibitors with photo&#8208;crosslinkers. By exploiting two types of ligand&#8208;guided chemistry, we identified novel activity&#8208;based probes capable of covalently modifying the active site of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) without any external trigger. The ability of these probes to label recombinant MMPs was validated in&#8197;vitro and the identity of the main labelling sites within their S3&#8242; region unambiguously assigned. We also demonstrated that our affinity probes can react with rhMMP12 at nanogram scale (that is, at 0.07&#8201;% (w/w)) in complex proteomes. Finally, this ligand&#8208;directed chemistry was successfully applied to label active MMP&#8208;12 secreted by eukaryote cells. We believe that this approach could be transferred more widely to many other metalloproteases, thus contributing to tackle their unresolved proteomic profiling in&#8197;vivo.

Following individual molecules and their changing environment during photoinduced dissociation reveals the importance of local changes during a reaction on its efficiency. Two counteracting processes lead to a volcano&#8208;shaped reactivity.







Abstract
Though largely influencing the efficiency of a reaction, the molecular&#8208;scale details of the local environment of the reactants are experimentally inaccessible hindering an in&#8208;depth understanding of a catalyst's reactivity, a prerequisite to maximizing its efficiency. We introduce a method to follow individual molecules and their largely changing environment during a photochemical reaction. The method is illustrated for a rate&#8208;limiting step in a photolytic reaction, the dissociation of CO2 on two catalytically relevant surfaces, Ag(100) and Cu(111). We reveal with a single&#8208;molecule resolution how the reactant's surroundings evolve with progressing laser illumination and with it their propensity for dissociation. Counteracting processes lead to a volcano&#8208;like reactivity. Our unprecedented local view during a photoinduced reaction opens the avenue for understanding the influence of the products on reaction yields on the nanoscale.

Viral untranslated regulatory regions (UTRs) contain a variety of conserved yet dynamic RNA structures crucial for viral replication. Combining in vitro RNA analysis with molecular dynamics simulations 3D models of the structure and dynamics of key regions of the 5&#8217; UTR of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 are created. Metallo&#8208;supramolecular helicates are shown to bind at a bulge and junction, and in cell assays confirm that they inhibit viral infection.







Abstract
The untranslated regions (UTRs) of viral genomes contain a variety of conserved yet dynamic structures crucial for viral replication, providing drug targets for the development of broad spectrum anti&#8208;virals. We combine in vitro RNA analysis with molecular dynamics simulations to build the first 3D models of the structure and dynamics of key regions of the 5&#8242; UTR of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genome. Furthermore, we determine the binding of metallo&#8208;supramolecular helicates (cylinders) to this RNA structure. These nano&#8208;size agents are uniquely able to thread through RNA junctions and we identify their binding to a 3&#8208;base bulge and the central cross 4&#8208;way junction located in stem loop 5. Finally, we show these RNA&#8208;binding cylinders suppress SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 replication, highlighting their potential as novel anti&#8208;viral agents.

         <title>Ultrasmall Nanocapsules Obtained by Controlling Ostwald Ripening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18094-18102, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ostwald ripening is used for reducing particle size in miniemulsions, providing a rapid and versatile method to synthesize silica nanocapsules with an ultrasmall size (ca. 6&#8197;nm) and a well&#8208;defined core&#8211;shell morphology, even at low surfactant concentration. Aqueous solubility of solvents and reactivity of alkoxysilanes used in the synthesis are the key factors in controlling the formation of ultrasmall nanocapsules.







Abstract
We describe here a method to synthesize ultrasmall nanocapsules with a diameter of 6&#8197;nm, exhibiting a well&#8208;defined core&#8211;shell morphology. Remarkably, the nanocapules are synthesized in a miniemulsion process without the need of large amounts of surfactant as commonly used in the microemulsion process. Ultrasmall nanocapsules with an oil core and a silica shell are formed by the concurrent processes of a sol&#8211;gel reaction and Ostwald ripening. Using solvents with different water solubilities and alkoxysilanes with different reactivities, we demonstrate that sizes of obtained nanocapsules depend on the ripening rate and alkoxysilane conversion rate. The method can be also used for encapsulating natural oils such as peppermint oil and limonene. This work shows that the Ostwald ripening phenomenon can be employed beneficially for the preparation of very small colloids.

Two modular&#8208;agent probes (MAPs) with same agents (small molecule scaffold module for construction and photodynamic reaction, module T for enhancing the internalization by tumor cells and module M for causing mitochondrial dysfunction) but different spatial arrangements are designed. T&#8208;AIE&#8208;M with larger RGD binding angle performed higher specificities, while TM&#8208;AIE characterizing longer &#945;&#8208;helix structure displayed superior toxicity.







Abstract
To overcome a series of challenges in tumor therapy, modular&#8208;agent probes (MAPs) comprised of various functional modules have been proposed. Researchers have tried to optimize the MAPs by exploiting the new modules or increasing the numbers of module, while neglecting the configuration of various modules. Here, we focus on the different spatial arrangements of existing modules. By utilizing a tetraphenylethylene (TPE) derivative with stereochemical structure and dual modifiable end&#8208;group sites as small molecule scaffold, two MAPs with same modular agents (module T for enhancing the internalization of MAPs by tumor cells and module M for causing mitochondrial dysfunction) but different spatial arrangements (on the one side, TM&#8208;AIE, and two sides, T&#8208;AIE&#8208;M, of the molecule scaffold) are designed. T&#8208;AIE&#8208;M with larger RGD binding angle performed higher specificity, while TM&#8208;AIE characterizing longer &#945;&#8208;helix structure displayed superior toxicity.

         <title>Access to and Reactivity of Fe0, Fe&#8722;I, FeI, and FeII PCcarbeneP Pincer Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18168-18177, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report access to an Fe0 PCcarbeneP pincer complex that proceeds via an isolated &#945;&#8208;hydroxylalkyl hydrido complex. Reversible carbonyl migration to the carbene position is found to allow coordination chemistry and E&#8722;H bond addition (E=H, B, Cl) across the iron&#8211;carbene linkage, representing a unique mechanism for metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity. The PCcarbeneP pincer ligand is also found to stabilize formal FeII, FeI and Fe&#8722;I oxidation states.







Abstract
Despite their promising metal&#8211;ligand cooperative reactivity, PCcarbeneP pincer ligands are rarely reported for first&#8208;row transition&#8208;metal centres. Using a dehydration methodology, we report access to an Fe0 PCcarbeneP pincer complex (1) that proceeds via an isolated &#945;&#8208;hydroxylalkyl hydrido complex (3). Reversible carbonyl migration to the carbene position in 1 is found to allow coordination chemistry and E&#8722;H bond addition (E=H, B, Cl) across the iron&#8211;carbene linkage, representing a unique mechanism for metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity. The PCcarbeneP pincer ligand is also found to stabilize formal FeII, FeI, and Fe&#8722;I oxidation states, as demonstrated with synthesis and characterization of the complexes [11&#8208;X][BArF20] (X=Br, I), 12, and K[13]. Compound K[13] is found to be highly reactive, and abstracts hydrogen from a range of aliphatic C&#8722;H sources. Computational analysis by DFT suggests that the formal FeI and Fe&#8722;I complexes contain significant carbene radical character. The ability of the PCcarbeneP ligand scaffold to partake in metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity and to support a range of iron oxidation states renders it as potentially useful in many catalytic applications.

         <title>Selective Bacterial Targeting and Infection&#8208;Triggered Release of Antibiotic Colistin Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 17989-17997, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional peptide&#8211;colistin conjugate for the treatment of bacterial infections has been synthesized. The conjugate binds to E.&#8197;coli bacteria by an all&#8208;d sequence of the human peptide ubiquicidin29&#8211;41. Host immune cells, activated upon infection, secrete the enzyme neutrophil elastase that cleaves an optimized linker sequence to release free colistin, a potent antibiotic that kills the bacteria.







Abstract
In order to render potent, but toxic antibiotics more selective, we have explored a novel conjugation strategy that includes drug accumulation followed by infection&#8208;triggered release of the drug. Bacterial targeting was achieved using a modified fragment of the human antimicrobial peptide ubiquicidin, as demonstrated by fluorophore&#8208;tagged variants. To limit the release of the effector colistin only to infection&#8208;related situations, we introduced a linker that was cleaved by neutrophil elastase (NE), an enzyme secreted by neutrophil granulocytes at infection sites. The linker carried an optimized sequence of amino acids that was required to assure sufficient cleavage efficiency. The antibacterial activity of five regioisomeric conjugates prepared by total synthesis was masked, but was released upon exposure to recombinant NE when the linker was attached to amino acids at the 1&#8208; or the 3&#8208;position of colistin. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept was achieved in co&#8208;cultures of primary human neutrophils and Escherichia coli that induced the secretion of NE, the release of free colistin, and an antibacterial efficacy that was equal to that of free colistin.

         <title>Zeolitic Octahedral Metal Oxides with Ultra&#8208;Small Micropores for C2 Hydrocarbon Separation</title>

Zeolitic cobalt molybdate was designed and synthesized for C2 hydrocarbon separation. The separation performance was able to be tuned by changing the composition of the material. The material showed good separation performance for C2 hydrocarbons even at high temperatures.







Abstract
Separation of C2 hydrocarbons, C2H6, C2H4, and C2H2, remains significant challenges in chemical industry. However, there are only few adsorbents that can effectively isolate C2 hydrocarbons from their mixtures particularly at a high temperature. Herein, we design a zeolitic octahedral metal oxide based on &#1013;&#8208;Keggin polyoxometalates with metal ion linkers. Single gas adsorption of the material shows the different adsorption performances for the C2 hydrocarbons and the strong interaction of the material with the C2 hydrocarbons. Dynamic competitive adsorption experiments show that the material efficiently separates each of the binary C2 hydrocarbon mixtures and even the ternary C2 hydrocarbon mixtures with high selectivity. The material keeps high separation performance even the temperature was increased to 85&#8201;&#176;C. The material is stable and is able to be reused without loss of the separation performance.

         <title>Unusual Surface Texture, Dimensions and Morphology Variations of Chiral and Single Crystals**

The egg&#8208;shaped homochiral crystals: A brain&#8208;like texture combined with single crystallinity. A series of isomorphous crystals found in a rare space group have been formed with varied morphologies. These crystals contain chiral channels and are made from achiral components.







Abstract
We demonstrate here a unique metallo&#8208;organic material where the appearance and the internal crystal structure are in contradiction. The egg&#8208;shaped (ovoid) crystals have a brain&#8208;like texture. Although these micro&#8208;sized crystals are monodispersed; like fingerprints their grainy surfaces are never exactly alike. Remarkably, our X&#8208;ray and electron diffraction studies unexpectedly revealed that these structures are single&#8208;crystals comprising a continuous coordination network of two differently shaped homochiral channels. By using the same building blocks under different reaction conditions, a rare series of crystals have been obtained that are uniquely rounded in their shape. In stark contrast to the brain&#8208;like crystals, these isostructural and monodispersed crystals have a comparatively smooth appearance. The sizes of these crystals vary by several orders of magnitude.

         <title>Regulation of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence to Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescent Emission Channels by Controlling the Excited&#8208;States Dynamics via J&#8208; and H&#8208;Aggregation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18059-18064, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
J&#8208;aggregates significantly reduce the energy gap between the lowest singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) excited states and contribute to the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process; while H&#8208;aggregates will accelerate ISC and suppress radiation transition of S1 to realize phosphorescence. This provides crucial information for the deep undrstanding of the internal mechanism of the excited state dynamics controlled by different aggregates.







Abstract
Control of excited&#8208;state dynamics is key in tuning room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emissions but is challenging for organic luminescent materials (OLMs). We show the regulation of TADF and RTP emissions of a boron difluoride &#946;&#8208;acetylnaphthalene chelate (&#946;CBF2) by controlling the excited&#8208;state dynamics via its J&#8208; and H&#8208;aggregation states. Two crystalline polymorphs emitting green and red light have been controllably obtained. Although both monoclinic, the green and red crystals are dominated by J&#8208; and H&#8208;aggregation, respectively, owing to different molecular packing arrangements. J&#8208;aggregation significantly reduces the energy gap between the lowest singlet and triplet excited states for ultra&#8208;fast reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) and enhances the radiative singlet decay, together leading to TADF. The H&#8208;aggregation accelerates the ISC and suppresses the radiative singlet decay, helping to stabilize the triplet exciton for RTP.

         <title>Photoinduced Electron&#8208;Transfer (PIET) Strategy for Selective Adsorption of CO2 over C2H2 in a MOF</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18223-18230, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using porous materials is a promising technique but a great challenge to achieve high CO2/C2H2 uptake ratio. This work has developed a PIET strategy and obtained the second highest CO2/C2H2 adsorption ratio for porous materials. These findings will promote the development of a new generation of CO2&#8208;selective adsorption technique in C2H2 production and inspire design and synthesis of porous materials for high efficient gas adsorption and separation.







Abstract
Similarities in sizes, shapes, and physical properties between carbon dioxide (CO2) and acetylene (C2H2) make it a great challenge to separate the major impurity CO2 from products in C2H2 production. The use of porous materials is an appealing path to replace current very costly and energy&#8208;consuming technologies, such as solvent extraction and cryogenic distillation; however, high CO2/C2H2 uptake ratio with minor adsorption of C2H2 at standard pressure was only unexpectedly observed in scarce examples in recent years although the related research started early at 1950s, and general design strategies to realize this aim are still absent. This work has successfully developed an efficient PIET strategy and obtained the second highest CO2/C2H2 adsorption ratio for porous materials in a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept MOF with a photochromism&#8208;active bipyridinium zwitterion. An unprecedented photocontrollable gate effect, owing to change of interannular dihedral after photoinduced generation of radical species, was also observed for the first time. These findings will inspire design and synthesis of porous materials for high efficient gas adsorption and separation.

         <title>Mechanistic Investigation on Copper&#8211;Arylacetylide Polymerization and Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18014-18021, August 9, 2021. </description>

For the first time, a copper&#8211;arylacetylide polymerization exhibiting the characteristics of mild reaction temperature, air atmosphere reaction, high molecular weight, and fast polymerization rate is presented. DFT calculations show that the polymerization is a thermodynamically favorable process. The resulting polymers exhibit strong fluorescence emission and inherent semiconductive properties.







Abstract
Exploration of new polymerization reactions is very intriguing in fundamental and practical research, which will advance reaction theories and produce various functional materials. Herein, we report a new polymerization method based on the reaction of CuI and arylacetylide, which generates linear polymers with high molecular weight and low polydispersity index of molecular weight. The Cu&#8211;arylacetylide polymerization exhibits different characteristics with traditional polymerizations such as mild reaction temperature, air atmosphere reaction, high molecular weight, fast polymerization rate, and imprecise molar ratio between monomers. The bond formation path and activation energy of each step was investigated by density functional theory calculations to understand the reaction mechanism. The poly(Cu&#8208;arylacetylide)s exhibit strong fluorescence emission and inherent semiconductive properties, which have been used to fabricate an electronic device for streptavidin sensing.

         <title>Porous Covalent Organic Polymers for Efficient Fluorocarbon&#8208;Based Adsorption Cooling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18037-18043, August 9, 2021. </description>

The first joint experimental&#8211;computational study of fluorocarbon adsorption into porous covalent organic polymers (COPs) reveals that the presence of structure defects leading to the creation of mesopores with a broad size range offers not only exceptional high&#8208;uptake adsorption of fluorocarbon R134a, but also unique overall linear&#8208;shaped isotherms. COPs are thus proven to be excellent sorbent materials for cooling applications.







Abstract
Adsorption&#8208;based cooling is an energy&#8208;efficient renewable&#8208;energy technology that can be driven using low&#8208;grade industrial waste heat and/or solar heat. Here, we report the first exploration of fluorocarbon adsorption using porous covalent organic polymers (COPs) for this cooling application. High fluorocarbon R134a equilibrium capacities and unique overall linear&#8208;shaped isotherms are revealed for the materials, namely COP&#8208;2 and COP&#8208;3. The key role of mesoporous defects on this unusual adsorption behavior was demonstrated by molecular simulations based on atomistic defect&#8208;containing models built for both porous COPs. Analysis of simulated R134a adsorption isotherms for various defect&#8208;containing atomistic models of the COPs shows a direct correlation between higher fluorocarbon adsorption capacities and increasing pore volumes induced by defects. Combined with their high porosities, excellent reversibility, fast kinetics, and large operating window, these defect&#8208;containing porous COPs are promising for adsorption&#8208;based cooling applications.

         <title>Solvated Nickel Complexes as Stoichiometric and Catalytic Perfluoroalkylation Agents**
</title>

&#8220;Ligandless&#8221; nickel was found to be exceptionally capable of acting as a reservoir of fluoroalkyl anions or radicals. This property was exploited to fluoroalkylate organic substrates under stoichiometric and catalytic conditions.







Abstract
The acetonitrile&#8208;solvated [(MeCN)Ni(C2F5)3]&#8722; was prepared in order to compare and contrast its reactivity with the known [(MeCN)Ni(CF3)3]&#8722; towards organic electrophiles. Both [(MeCN)Ni(CF3)3]&#8722; and [(MeCN)Ni(C2F5)3]&#8722; successfully react with aryl iodonium and diazonium salts as well as alkynyl iodonium salts to give fluoroalkylated organic products. Electrochemical analysis of [(MeCN)NiII(C2F5)3]&#8722; suggests that, upon electro&#8208;oxidation to [(MeCN)nNiIII(C2F5)3], reductive homolysis of a perfluoroethyl radical occurs, with the concomitant formation of [(MeCN)2NiII(C2F5)2]. Catalytic C&#8722;H trifluoromethylations of electron&#8208;rich arenes were successfully achieved using either [(MeCN)Ni(CF3)3]&#8722; or the related [Ni(CF3)4]2&#8722;. Stoichiometric reactions of the solvated nickel complexes reveal that &#8220;ligandless&#8221; nickel is exceptionally capable of serving as reservoir of CF3 groups under catalytically relevant conditions.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Mediated In Situ Self&#8208;Assembly Promotes In Vivo Bioorthogonal Reaction for Pretargeted Multimodality Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18082-18093, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pretargeted multimodality imaging strategy is based on a combination of the enzyme&#8208;mediated fluorogenic reaction and in situ self&#8208;assembly with the IEDDA reaction. A trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) bearing a small&#8208;molecule probe is first activated by the target enzyme, leading to in situ self&#8208;assembly and enrichment of the TCOs. This allows subsequent labelling of radioisotopes via the IEDDA reaction, providing NIR FL, MRI and PET signals for in vivo imaging.







Abstract
Pretargeted imaging has emerged as a promising approach to advance nuclear imaging of malignant tumors. Herein, we combine the enzyme&#8208;mediated fluorogenic reaction and in situ self&#8208;assembly with the inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction to develop an activatable pretargeted strategy for multimodality imaging. The trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) bearing small&#8208;molecule probe, P&#8208;FFGd&#8208;TCO, can be activated by alkaline phosphatase and in situ self&#8208;assembles into nanoaggregates (FMNPs&#8208;TCO) retained on the membranes, permitting to (1) amplify near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence (FL) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signals, and (2) enrich TCOs to promote IEDDA ligation. The Gallium&#8208;68 (68Ga) labeled tetrazine can readily conjugate the tumor&#8208;retained FMNPs&#8208;TCO to enhance radioactivity uptake in tumors. Strong NIR FL, MRI, and positron emission tomography (PET) signals are concomitantly achieved, allowing for pretargeted multimodality imaging of ALP activity in HeLa tumor&#8208;bearing mice.

Unprecedentedly stable salts of the 1,3&#8208;bis(tricyanoborane)imidazolate ion with different types of counterions were obtained on large scale. Deprotonation of the imidazolate ion provided access to the corresponding dianionic NHC that acts as ditopic ligand.







Abstract
The 1,3&#8208;bis(tricyanoborane)imidazolate anion 1 was obtained in high yield from lithium imidazolate and B(CN)3&#8722;pyridine adduct. Anion 1 is chemically very robust and thus allowed the isolation of the corresponding H5O2+ salt. Furthermore, monoanion 1 served as starting species for the novel dianionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC), 1,3&#8208;bis(tricyanoborane)imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenate anion 3 that acts as ditopic ligand via the carbene center and the cyano groups at boron. First reactions of this new NHC 3 with methyl iodide, elemental selenium, and [Ni(CO)4] led to the methylated imidazolate ion 4, the dianionic selenium adduct 5, and the dianionic nickel tricarbonyl complex 6. These NHC derivatives provide a first insight into the electronic and steric properties of the dianionic NHC 3. Especially the combination of properties, such as double negative charge, different coordination sites, large buried volume and good &#963;&#8208;donor and &#960;&#8208;acceptor ability, make NHC 3 a unique and promising ligand and building block.

         <title>Heterogeneously Catalyzed Aerobic Oxidation of Methane to a Methyl Derivative</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18138-18143, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methane is aerobically converted to an oxidation&#8208;resistant methyl ester in high yields with a solid cobalt&#8208;containing catalyst at a moderate temperature and pressure. Improved reaction conditions result from the dilution of the trifluoroacetic acid in an inert perfluoroalkane co&#8208;solvent. The fluorous character of the solvent enables the facile recovery of the product ester through a simple liquid&#8208;liquid extraction with non&#8208;fluorous solvent.







Abstract
A promising strategy to break through the selectivity&#8208;conversion limit of direct methane conversion to achieve high yields is the protection of methanol via esterification to a more stable methyl ester. We present an aerobic methane&#8208;to&#8208;methyl&#8208;ester approach that utilizes a highly dispersed, cobalt&#8208;containing solid catalyst, along with significantly more favorable reaction conditions compared to existing homogeneously&#8208;catalyzed approaches (e.g. diluted acid, O2 oxidant, moderate temperature and pressure). The trifluoroacetic acid medium is diluted (&lt;25&#8197;wt&#8201;%) with an inert fluorous co&#8208;solvent that can be recovered after the separation of the methyl trifluoroacetate via liquid&#8211;liquid extraction at ambient conditions. Silica&#8208;supported cobalt catalysts are highly active in this system, with competitive yields and turnovers in comparison to known aerobic transition metal&#8208;based catalytic systems.

         <title>Introducing Intermolecular Cation&#8208;&#960; Interactions for Water&#8208;Stable Low Dimensional Hybrid Lead Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18265-18271, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead halide perovskites are unstable in water due to the high water solubility of the A&#8208;site cations present in them. We introduce the intermolecular cation&#8208;&#960; interactions between the A&#8208;site organic cations in 1D hybrid lead bromide perovskites. The cation&#8208;&#960; interactions make these 1D perovskites completely stable in water.







Abstract
Optoelectronically active hybrid lead halide perovskites dissociate in water. To prevent this dissociation, here, we introduce long&#8208;range intermolecular cation&#8208;&#960; interactions between A&#8208;site cations of hybrid perovskites. An aromatic diamine like 4,4&#8242;&#8208;trimethylenedipyridine, if protonated, can show a long&#8208;range cation&#8208;&#960; stacking, and therefore, serves as our A&#8208;site cation. Consequently, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;trimethylenedipyridinium lead bromide [(4,4&#8242;&#8208;TMDP)Pb2Br6], a one&#8208;dimensional hybrid perovskite, remains completely stable after continuous water treatment for six months. Mechanistic insights about the cation&#8208;&#960; interactions are obtained by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The concept of long&#8208;range cation&#8208;&#960; interaction is further extended to another A&#8208;site cation 4,4&#8242;&#8208;ethylenedipyridinium ion (4,4&#8242;&#8208;EDP), forming water&#8208;stable (4,4&#8242;&#8208;EDP)Pb2Br6 perovskite. These water&#8208;stable perovskites are then used to fabricate white light&#8208;emitting diode and for light up&#8208;conversion through tunable third&#8208;harmonic generation. Note that the achieved water stability is the intrinsic stability of perovskite composition, unlike the prior approach of encapsulating the unstable perovskite material (or device) by water&#8208;resistant materials. The introduced cation&#8208;&#960; interactions can be a breakthrough strategy in designing many more compositions of water&#8208;stable low&#8208;dimensional hybrid perovskites.

Directed C&#8722;H functionalization has been realized to achieve borylation at a distal position of aliphatic amines. The oxidative borylation at the distal &#948;&#8208;position of aliphatic amines is achieved using various borylating agents, a palladium catalyst, and a rightly tuned ligand in the presence of a cheap oxidant. Moreover, an organopalladium &#948;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H&#8208;activated intermediate has been isolated and crystallographically characterized.

A stable and selective Au/TS&#8208;1 catalyst is synthesised for direct gas phase epoxidation of propylene to propylene oxide, a key commodity chemical. The synthesis methodology is highly versatile for obtaining a stable, supported gold catalyst. The stabilising ligands play an important role in providing enhanced stability to the Au nanoparticles.







Abstract
Designing a stable and selective catalyst with high H2 utilisation is of pivotal importance for the direct gas&#8208;phase epoxidation of propylene. This work describes a facile one&#8208;pot methodology to synthesise ligand&#8208;stabilised sub&#8208;nanometre gold clusters immobilised onto a zeolitic support (TS&#8208;1) to engineer a stable Au/TS&#8208;1 catalyst. A non&#8208;thermal O2 plasma technique is used for the quick removal of ligands with limited increase in particle size. Compared to untreated Au/TS&#8208;1 catalysts prepared using the deposition precipitation method, the synthesised catalyst exhibits improved catalytic performance, including 10 times longer lifetime (&gt;20&#8197;days), increased PO selectivity and hydrogen efficiency in direct gas phase epoxidation. The structure&#8208;stability relationship of the catalyst is illustrated using multiple characterisation techniques, such as XPS, 31P MAS NMR, DR&#8208;UV/VIS, HRTEM and TGA. It is hypothesised that the ligands play a guardian role in stabilising the Au particle size, which is vital in this reaction. This strategy is a promising approach towards designing a more stable heterogeneous catalyst.

         <title>Fluorinated Poly&#8208;oxalate Electrolytes Stabilizing both Anode and Cathode Interfaces for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li/NMC811 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18335-18343, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of F&#8208;terminated poly&#8208;oxalate structures were prepared, in which the odd&#8208;carbon&#8208;diol precursors endow higher Li+ conductivity. The terminal trifluoroacetate units not only help to generate a LiF&#8208;based passivating layer with the Li&#8208;metal anode, but also improve the antioxidative capability, with which the cycling performance of the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal/NMC811 cells was significantly improved.







Abstract
The relatively narrow electrochemical steady window and low ionic conductivity are two critical challenges for Li+&#8208;conducting solid polymer electrolytes (SPE). Here, a family of poly&#8208;oxalate(POE) structures were prepared as SPE; among them, POEs composed from diols with an odd number of carbons show higher ionic conductivity than those composed from diols with an even number of carbons, and the POE composed from propanediol (C5&#8208;POE) has the highest Li+ conductivity. The HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) electrons of POE were found located on the terminal units. When using trifluoroacetate as the terminating unit (POE&#8208;F), not only does the HOMO become more negative, but also the HOMO electrons shift to the middle oxalate units, improving the antioxidative capability. Furthermore, the interfacial compatibility across the Li&#8208;metal/POE&#8208;F is also improved by the generation of a LiF&#8208;based solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interlayer(SEI).

&lt;p&gt;A family of F-terminated poly-oxalate structures were prepared, in which the odd-carbon-diol precursors endow higher Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductivity. The terminal trifluoroacetate units not only help to generate a LiF-based passivating layer with the Li-metal anode, but also improve the antioxidative capability, with which the cycling performance of the all-solid-state Li-metal/NMC811 cells was significantly improved.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relatively narrow electrochemical steady window and low ionic conductivity are two critical challenges for Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-conducting solid polymer electrolytes (SPE). Here, a family of poly-oxalate(POE) structures were prepared as SPE; among them, POEs composed from diols with an odd number of carbons show higher ionic conductivity than those composed from diols with an even number of carbons, and the POE composed from propanediol (C5-POE) has the highest Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductivity. The HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) electrons of POE were found located on the terminal units. When using trifluoroacetate as the terminating unit (POE-F), not only does the HOMO become more negative, but also the HOMO electrons shift to the middle oxalate units, improving the antioxidative capability. Furthermore, the interfacial compatibility across the Li-metal/POE-F is also improved by the generation of a LiF-based solid-electrolyte-interlayer(SEI). With the trifluoroacetate-terminated C5-POE (C5-POE-F) as the electrolyte and Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-conducting binder in the cathode, the all-solid-state Li/LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NMC811) cells showed significantly improved stability than the counterpart with poly-ether, providing a promising candidate for the forthcoming all-solid-state high-voltage Li-metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Selective Permeable Lithium&#8208;Ion Channels on Lithium Metal for Practical Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18031-18036, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selectively permeable lithium&#8208;ion channels, which were created by aminopropyl&#8208;terminated polydimethylsiloxanes anchored on the lithium metal surface, allow lithium ions to get through, while the polysulfides are effectively blocked due to their much larger volume. The selective lithium ion channels enable a prolonged cycle life and a high Coulombic efficiency of 99&#8201;% in a practical Li&#8211;S pouch cell.







Abstract
Lithium metal batteries are considered a promising candidate for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy storage. However, the strong reducibility and high reactivity of lithium lead to low Coulombic efficiency when contacting oxidants, such as lithium polysulfide caused by the serious &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221; in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. Herein we design selectively permeable lithium&#8208;ion channels on lithium metal surface, which allow lithium ions to pass through by electrochemical overpotential, while the polysulfides are effectively blocked due to the much larger steric hindrance than lithium ions. The selective permeation of lithium ions through the channels is further elucidated by the molecular simulation and visualization experiment. Consequently, a prolonged cycle life of 75&#8197;cycles and high Coulombic efficiency of 99&#8201;% are achieved in a practical Li&#8211;S pouch cell with limited amounts of lithium and electrolyte, confirming the unique role the selective ion permeation plays in protecting highly reactive alkali metal anodes in working batteries.

A route for the spatiotemporal control of intracellular RNA epigenetic modifications is presented. The agonism effect of a small compound can be concealed through appropriate photo&#8208;responsive caging groups, and the synthesized compounds exhibited a high sensitivity of external light irradiation and rapidly restored their effects in live cells.







Abstract
Bioactive small molecules with photo&#8208;removable protecting groups have provided spatial and temporal control of corresponding biological effects. We present the design, synthesis, computational and experimental evaluation of the first photo&#8208;activatable small&#8208;molecule methyltransferase agonist. By blocking the functional N&#8208;H group on MPCH with a photo&#8208;removable ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl moiety, we have developed a promising photo&#8208;caged compound that had completely concealed its biological activity. Short UV light exposure of cells treated with that caged molecule in a few minutes resulted in a considerable hypermethylation of m6A modification in transcriptome RNAs, implicating a rapid release of the parent active compound. This study validates for the first time the photo&#8208;activatable small organic molecular concept in the field of RNA epigenetic research, which represents a novel tool in spatiotemporal and cellular modulation approaches.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Design of G&#8208;Protein&#8208;Coupled Receptor Polypharmacology</title>

Structure&#8208;based modelling was used to design a single compound with the ability to modulate the activity of two G&#8208;protein&#8208;coupled receptors relevant for Parkinson's disease. The most potent scaffold displayed nanomolar binding affinities for both targets and was active in a rat model of parkinsonism.







Abstract
Many diseases are polygenic and can only be treated efficiently with drugs that modulate multiple targets. However, rational design of compounds with multi&#8208;target profiles is rarely pursued because it is considered too difficult, in particular if the drug must enter the central nervous system. Here, a structure&#8208;based strategy to identify dual&#8208;target ligands of G&#8208;protein&#8208;coupled receptors is presented. We use this approach to design compounds that both antagonize the A2A adenosine receptor and activate the D2 dopamine receptor, which have excellent potential as antiparkinson drugs. Atomic resolution models of the receptors guided generation of a chemical library with compounds designed to occupy orthosteric and secondary binding pockets in both targets. Structure&#8208;based virtual screens identified ten compounds, of which three had affinity for both targets. One of these scaffolds was optimized to nanomolar dual&#8208;target activity and showed the predicted pharmacodynamic effect in a rat model of Parkinsonism.

         <title>Simultaneous Regulation on Solvation Shell and Electrode Interface for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Ion Batteries Achieved by a Low&#8208;Cost Glucose Additive</title>

A low&#8208;cost glucose additive into traditional ZnSO4 electrolyte can greatly inhibit the dendrite growth on Zn anodes in Zn ion batteries by simultaneously modulating the solvation shell in the electrolyte and electrode interface.







Abstract
Dendrite growth and by&#8208;products in Zn metal aqueous batteries have impeded their development as promising energy storage devices. We utilize a low&#8208;cost additive, glucose, to modulate the typical ZnSO4 electrolyte system for improving reversible plating/stripping on Zn anode for high&#8208;performance Zn ion batteries (ZIBs). Combing experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations, we show that the glucose in ZnSO4 aqueous environment can simultaneously modulate solvation structure of Zn2+ and Zn anode&#8208;electrolyte interface. The electrolyte engineering can alternate one H2O molecule from the primary Zn2+&#8208;6H2O solvation shell and restraining side reactions due to the decomposition of active water. Concomitantly, glucose molecules are inclined to absorb on the surface of Zn anode, suppressing the random growth of Zn dendrite. As a proof of concept, a symmetric cell and Zn&#8208;MnO2 full cell with glucose electrolyte achieve boosted stability than that with pure ZnSO4 electrolyte.

         <title>The Controllable Reconstruction of Bi&#8208;MOFs for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction through Electrolyte and Potential Mediation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18178-18184, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reconstruction of Bi&#8208;MOFs prior to CO2 electroreduction can be decoupled into two steps: 1)&#8197;electrolyte&#8208;mediated conversion of Bi&#8208;MOFs to Bi2O2CO3 by HCO3&#8722;&#8208;initiated ligand substitution, and 2)&#8197;potential&#8208;mediated reduction of Bi2O2CO3 to Bi. The first step controls the final morphology and structure, whilst the second step determines the final composition and valence states.







Abstract
Monitoring and controlling the reconstruction of materials under working conditions is crucial for the precise identification of active sites, elucidation of reaction mechanisms, and rational design of advanced catalysts. Herein, a Bi&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Bi&#8208;MOF) for electrochemical CO2 reduction is selected as a case study. In situ Raman spectra combined with ex situ electron microscopy reveal that the intricate reconstruction of the Bi&#8208;MOF can be controlled using two steps: 1)&#8197;electrolyte&#8208;mediated dissociation and conversion of Bi&#8208;MOF to Bi2O2CO3, and 2)&#8197;potential&#8208;mediated reduction of Bi2O2CO3 to Bi. The intentionally reconstructed Bi&#8197;catalyst exhibits excellent activity, selectivity, and durability for formate production, and the unsaturated surface Bi&#8197;atoms formed during reconstruction become the active sites. This work emphasizes the significant impact of pre&#8208;catalyst reconstruction under working conditions and provides insight into the design of highly active and stable electrocatalysts through the regulation of these processes.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Based Microparticle Tension Sensors (&#956;TS) for Measuring Cell Mechanics in Non&#8208;planar Geometries and for High&#8208;Throughput Quantification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18044-18050, August 9, 2021. </description>

A microparticle tension sensor is designed for measuring molecular forces in non&#8208;planar geometries and for high&#8208;throughput flow cytometry analysis of cell mechanics.







Abstract
Mechanotransduction, the interplay between physical and chemical signaling, plays vital roles in many biological processes. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques to quantify cell forces employ deformable polymer films or molecular probes tethered to glass substrates. However, the applications of these assays in fundamental and clinical research are restricted by the planar geometry and low throughput of microscopy readout. Herein, we develop a DNA&#8208;based microparticle tension sensor, which features a spherical surface and thus allows for investigation of mechanotransduction at curved interfaces. The micron&#8208;scale of &#956;TS enables flow cytometry readout, which is rapid and high throughput. We applied the method to map and measure T&#8208;cell receptor forces and platelet integrin forces at 12 and 56&#8197;pN thresholds. Furthermore, we quantified the inhibition efficiency of two anti&#8208;platelet drugs providing a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of &#956;TS to screen drugs that modulate cellular mechanics.

         <title>Scalable Fabrication of Crystalline COF Membranes from Amorphous Polymeric Membranes</title>

A disorder&#8208;to&#8208;order transformation strategy is developed for the scalable fabrication of highly crystalline covalent organic framework (COF) membrane from amorphous polymeric membrane via monomer exchange.







Abstract
Covalent organic framework (COF) membranes hold potential for widespread applicability, but scalable fabrication is challenging. Here, we demonstrate the disorder&#8208;to&#8208;order transformation from amorphous polymeric membrane to crystalline COF membrane via monomer exchange. Solution processing is used to prepare amorphous membrane and the replacing monomer is selected based on the chemical and thermodynamical stability of the final framework. Reversible imine bonds allow the extraneous monomers to replace the pristine monomers within amorphous membrane, driving the transformation from disordered network to ordered framework. Incorporation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds enables the crystalline COF to imprint the amorphous membrane morphology. The COF membranes harvest proton conductivity up to 0.53&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C. Our strategy bridges amorphous polymeric and crystalline COF membranes for large&#8208;scale fabrication of COF membranes and affords guidance on materials processing.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;like Supramolecular Iridium Catalysis Enabling C&#8722;H Bond Borylation of Pyridines with meta&#8208;Selectivity</title>

         <dc:description>
An iridium&#8208;based supramolecular catalyst has been designed to selectively recognize pyridine&#8208;like derivatives via secondary Zn&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions. Owing to the distance between the substrate binding site and the active site as well as the geometrical constraints, meta&#8208;selective borylation reactions were accomplished displaying catalytic behaviors typically encountered in enzymes.







Abstract
The use of secondary interactions between substrates and catalysts is a promising strategy to discover selective transition metal catalysts for atom&#8208;economy C&#8722;H bond functionalization. The most powerful catalysts are found via trial&#8208;and&#8208;error screening due to the low association constants between the substrate and the catalyst in which small stereo&#8208;electronic modifications within them can lead to very different reactivities. To circumvent these limitations and to increase the level of reactivity prediction in these important reactions, we report herein a supramolecular catalyst harnessing Zn&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions that binds to pyridine&#8208;like substrates as tight as it can be found in some enzymes. The distance and spatial geometry between the active site and the substrate binding site is ideal to target unprecedented meta&#8208;selective iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond borylations with enzymatic Michaelis&#8211;Menten kinetics, besides unique substrate selectivity and dormant reactivity patterns.

         <title>Influence of Magnetic Fields on Electrochemical Reactions of Redox Cofactor Solutions</title>

         <dc:description>
Through a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches the underlying mechanism of magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;driven enhancement of Faradaic currents in solutions of redox cofactors, such as flavin mononucleotide, was investigated. The findings reveal that a magneto&#8208;hydrodynamic effect rather than radical pair mechanism is responsible for the observed current enhancement.







Abstract
Redox cofactors mediate many enzymatic processes and are increasingly employed in biomedical and energy applications. Exploring the influence of external magnetic fields on redox cofactor chemistry can enhance our understanding of magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;sensitive biological processes and allow the application of magnetic fields to modulate redox reactions involving cofactors. Through a combination of experiments and modeling, we investigate the influence of magnetic fields on electrochemical reactions in redox cofactor solutions. By employing flavin mononucleotide (FMN) cofactor as a model system, we characterize magnetically induced changes in Faradaic currents. We find that radical pair intermediates have negligible influence on current increases in FMN solution upon application of a magnetic field. The dominant mechanism underlying the observed current increases is the magneto&#8208;hydrodynamic effect. We extend our analyses to other diffusion&#8208;limited electrochemical reactions of redox cofactor solutions and arrive at similar conclusions, highlighting the opportunity to use this framework in redox cofactor chemistry.

         <title>A Family of Superhelicenes: Easily Tunable, Chiral Nanographenes by Merging Helicity with Planar &#960; Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18073-18081, August 9, 2021. </description>

We present the synthesis and in&#8208;depth physico&#8208;chemical characterization of a family of &#960;&#8208;extended helicenes that consist of HBCs fused via different five&#8208;membered rings. Despite being only a small part of the compounds, the nature of the five&#8208;membered rings has a huge impact on the properties of the whole molecule. We show the enantiomeric separation and circular dichroism properties together with X&#8208;ray analysis and charge transport calculations.







Abstract
We designed a straightforward synthetic route towards a full&#8208;fledged family of &#960;&#8208;extended helicenes: superhelicenes. They have two hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes (HBCs) in common that are connected via a central five&#8208;membered ring. By means of structurally altering this 5&#8208;membered ring, we realized a versatile library of molecular building blocks. Not only the superhelicene structure, but also their features are tuned with ease. In&#8208;depth physico&#8208;chemical characterizations served as a proof of concept thereof. The superhelicene enantiomers were separated, their circular dichroism was measured in preliminary studies and concluded with an enantiomeric assignment. Our work was rounded&#8208;off by crystal structure analyses. Mixed stacks of M&#8208; and P&#8208;isomers led to twisted molecular wires. Using such stacks, charge&#8208;carrier mobilities were calculated, giving reason to expect outstanding hole transporting properties.

         <title>Coupling Aptamer&#8208;based Protein Tagging with Metabolic Glycan Labeling for In Situ Visualization and Biological Function Study of Exosomal Protein&#8208;Specific Glycosylation</title>

A dual labeling strategy for in situ visualization of exosomal protein&#8208;specific glycosylation based on a protein&#8208;specific aptamer tagging and metabolic glycan labeling (ExoAp&#8208;MGL) was used to study the presence and function of exosomal protein&#8208;specific glycosylation. Exosomal PD&#8208;L1 glycosylation is required for the interaction of exoPD&#8208;L1/PD&#8208;1 and inhibition of CD8+ T cell proliferation.







Abstract
Exosomal glycoproteins play important roles in many physiological and pathological functions. Herein, we developed a dual labeling strategy based on a protein&#8208;specific aptamer tagging and metabolic glycan labeling for visualizing glycosylation of specific proteins on exosomes. The glycosylation of exosomal PD&#8208;L1 (exoPD&#8208;L1) was imaged in situ using intramolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between fluorescent PD&#8208;L1 aptamers bound on exoPD&#8208;L1 and fluorescent tags on glycans introduced via metabolic glycan labeling. This method enables in situ visualization and biological function study of exosomal protein glycosylation. Exosomal PD&#8208;L1 glycosylation was confirmed to be required in interaction with PD&#8208;1 and participated in inhibiting of CD8+ T cell proliferation. This is an efficient and non&#8208;destructive method to study the presence and function of exosomal protein&#8208;specific glycosylation in situ, which provides a powerful tool for exosomal glycoproteomics research.

         <title>Improved Reactive Oxygen Species Generation by Chiral Co3O4 Supraparticles under Electromagnetic Fields</title>

Chiral Co3O4 supraparticles (SPs) with a g&#8208;factor of up to 0.02 at 550&#8197;nm and paramagnetic performance were applied in the treatment of thromboembolism under an electromagnetic field (MF). Compared to l&#8208;SPs, d&#8208;SPs exhibited much stronger thrombolytic ability and effectively enhanced the survival rate of thrombosis model mice more than 70&#8201;% in the 25&#8197;d of observation.







Abstract
One of the most common methods to treat thromboembolism is the use of thrombolytic drugs to activate fibrinolytic protease. The aim of this treatment was to initiate the lysis of fibrin; however, there are many side&#8208;effects associated with this form of treatment. Herein, we fabricated chiral Co3O4 supraparticles (SPs) with a g&#8208;factor of up to 0.02 at 550&#8197;nm and paramagnetic performance applied in the treatment of thromboembolism under an electromagnetic field (MF). In vitro experiments showed that d&#8208;SPs degraded blood clot within 8&#8197;hours under MF. Compared to l&#8208;SPs, d&#8208;SPs exhibited much stronger thrombolytic ability and effectively enhanced the survival rate of thrombosis model mice more than 70&#8201;% in the 25&#8197;d of observation. The results of mechanism study showed that under MF, the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by d&#8208;SPs were 1.5 times higher than that of l&#8208;SPs, which might be attributed to the chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity effects.

A computational and experimental study on the reaction of oxadiazinones and strained alkynes to give polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is reported. Mechanistic aspects of the reaction, such as why the use of non&#8208;aromatic strained alkynes can be used to access unsymmetrical PAHs whereas the use of arynes leads to symmetrical PAHs, are investigated. Experimental studies enable the rapid synthesis of new PAHs, including tetracene and pentacene scaffolds.







Abstract
We report a computational and experimental study of the reaction of oxadiazinones and strained alkynes to give polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The reaction proceeds by way of a pericyclic reaction cascade and leads to the formation of four new carbon&#8722;carbon bonds. Using M06&#8208;2X DFT calculations, we interrogate several mechanistic aspects of the reaction, such as why the use of non&#8208;aromatic strained alkynes can be used to access unsymmetrical PAHs, whereas the use of arynes in the methodology leads to symmetrical PAHs. In addition, experimental studies enable the rapid synthesis of new PAHs, including tetracene and pentacene scaffolds. These studies not only provide fundamental insight regarding the aforementioned cycloaddition cascades and synthetic access to PAH scaffolds, but are also expected to enable the synthesis of new materials.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Adsorbed Carboxylate Ligands on Layered Double Hydroxides/Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Promote the Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18129-18137, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), surface&#8208;adsorbed carboxylate ligands on bi/trimetallic layered double hydroxides (LDHs)/MOFs demonstrate a synergistic effect. As a Lewis base the carboxylate ligands promote the sluggish OER by accelerating proton transfer and facilitating adsorption, activation, and dissociation of OH&#8722; ions, while also facilitating intrinsic electron redistribution and a partially distorted octahedral structure.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with carboxylate ligands as co&#8208;catalysts are very efficient for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the role of local adsorbed carboxylate ligands around the in&#8208;situ&#8208;transformed metal (oxy)hydroxides during OER is often overlooked. We reveal the extraordinary role and mechanism of surface&#8208;adsorbed carboxylate ligands on bi/trimetallic layered double hydroxides (LDHs)/MOFs for OER electrocatalytic activity enhancement. The results of X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the carboxylic groups around metal (oxy)hydroxides can efficiently induce interfacial electron redistribution, facilitate an abundant high&#8208;valence state of nickel species with a partially distorted octahedral structure, and optimize the d&#8208;band center together with the beneficial Gibbs free energy of the intermediate. Furthermore, the results of in&#8197;situ Raman and FTIR spectra reveal that the surface&#8208;adsorbed carboxylate ligands as Lewis base can promote sluggish OER kinetics by accelerating proton transfer and facilitating adsorption, activation, and dissociation of hydroxyl ions (OH&#8722;).

&lt;p&gt;In the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), surface-adsorbed carboxylate ligands on bi/trimetallic layered double hydroxides (LDHs)/MOFs demonstrate a synergistic effect. As a Lewis base the carboxylate ligands promote the sluggish OER by accelerating proton transfer and facilitating adsorption, activation, and dissociation of OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions, while also facilitating intrinsic electron redistribution and a partially distorted octahedral structure.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with carboxylate ligands as co-catalysts are very efficient for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the role of local adsorbed carboxylate ligands around the in-situ-transformed metal (oxy)hydroxides during OER is often overlooked. We reveal the extraordinary role and mechanism of surface-adsorbed carboxylate ligands on bi/trimetallic layered double hydroxides (LDHs)/MOFs for OER electrocatalytic activity enhancement. The results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the carboxylic groups around metal (oxy)hydroxides can efficiently induce interfacial electron redistribution, facilitate an abundant high-valence state of nickel species with a partially distorted octahedral structure, and optimize the d-band center together with the beneficial Gibbs free energy of the intermediate. Furthermore, the results of in&#8197;situ Raman and FTIR spectra reveal that the surface-adsorbed carboxylate ligands as Lewis base can promote sluggish OER kinetics by accelerating proton transfer and facilitating adsorption, activation, and dissociation of hydroxyl ions (OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

Extreme gas&#8208;phase chemistry with the exotic transactinide dubnium and its lighter homologues tantalum and niobium is described by Nadine&#8197;M. Chiera, Tetsuya&#8197;K. Sato, and co&#8208;workers in their Communication on page&#8197;17871. The sequence of volatility among Group&#8197;5 elements, as deduced from the behavior of their oxychloride compounds, is in agreement with Mendeleev's law, establishing dubnium as one of the least volatile elements of the periodic table.

Fluorescent polymeric nanoparticles have emerged as a highly attractive and promising platform for the visualisation of complex biological and pathological processes. This Minireview discusses different strategies based on polymeric nanoparticles for enhanced bioimaging applications. Solutions to overcome problems in the existing systems are also proposed.







Abstract
In recent years, polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) have become increasingly popular for in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo bioimaging because of their excellent versatility and exceptional optical properties. Following a brief introduction on fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging, as well as the merits of using polymeric NPs over other types of fluorescent probes, this Minireview gives a concise summary of key advances made in recent years (2017&#8211;2020) in the use of polymeric NPs for fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging. A particular focus is placed on various strategies used for enhanced bioimaging applications, including polymeric NPs that encapsulate near&#8208;infrared dyes, aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission fluorogens, cationic dyes doped with bulky hydrophobic counterions, and semiconducting polymers. Next, the current limitations in some of these polymeric NP systems are summarized and potential solutions offered to overcome them. Finally, some critical considerations in regard to the design of polymeric NPs are given for future bioimaging and sensing applications.

This Minireview examines how recent work on capillary microfluidics for point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics may be used to enhance adherence to medication.







Abstract
Medication adherence is a medical and societal issue worldwide, with approximately half of patients failing to adhere to prescribed treatments. The goal of this Minireview is to examine how recent work on microfluidics for point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics may be used to enhance adherence to medication. It specifically focuses on capillary microfluidics since these devices are self&#8208;powered, easy to use, and well established for diagnostics and drug monitoring. Considering that an improvement in medication adherence can have a much larger effect than the development of new medical treatments, it is long overdue for the research communities working in chemistry, biology, pharmacology, and material sciences to consider developing technologies to enhance medication adherence. For these reasons, this Minireview is not meant to be exhaustive but rather to provide a quick starting point for researchers interested in joining this complex but intriguing and exciting field of research.

The generation of NiIII and excited NiII intermediates facilitates the reductive elimination step leading to the mild cross&#8208;couplings. This review provides an overview of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art approaches for mild C&#8208;heteroatom bond formations via homo&#8208; and heterogeneous photoredox and nickel dual catalysis, electro&#8208; and nickel dual catalysis, as well as conventional zinc and nickel dual catalysis.







Abstract
The formation of C&#8208;heteroatom bonds represents an important type of bond&#8208;forming reaction in organic synthesis and often provides a fast and efficient access to privileged structures found in pharmaceuticals, agrochemical and materials. In contrast to conventional Pd&#8208; or Cu&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;heteroatom cross&#8208;couplings under high&#8208;temperature conditions, recent advances in homo&#8208; and heterogeneous Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;heteroatom formations under mild conditions are particularly attractive from the standpoint of sustainability and practicability. The generation of NiIII and excited NiII intermediates facilitate the reductive elimination step to achieve mild cross&#8208;couplings. This review provides an overview of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art approaches for mild C&#8208;heteroatom bond formations and highlights the developments in photoredox and nickel dual catalysis involving SET and energy transfer processes; photoexcited nickel catalysis; electro and nickel dual catalysis; heterogeneous photoredox and nickel dual catalysis involving graphitic carbon nitride (mpg&#8208;CN), metal organic frameworks (MOFs) or semiconductor quantum dots (QDs); as well as more conventional zinc and nickel dual catalyzed reactions.

Fuel cells are a powerful renewable energy technology. This review gives a comprehensive overview on oxygen reduction electrocatalysts towards practical fuel cells.







Abstract
Fuel cells are an incredibly powerful renewable energy technology, but their broad applications remains lagging because of the high cost and poor reliability of cathodic electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). This review focuses on the recent progress of ORR electrocatalysts in fuel cells. More importantly, it highlights the fundamental problems associated with the insufficient activity translation from rotating disk electrode to membrane electrode assembly in the fuel cells. Finally, for the atomic&#8208;level in&#8208;depth information on ORR catalysts in fuel cells, potential perspectives are suggested, including large&#8208;scale preparation, unified assessment criteria, advanced interpretation techniques, advanced simulation and artificial intelligence. This review aims to provide valuable insights into the fundamental science and technical engineering for efficient ORR electrocatalysts in fuel cells.

         <title>A Trapezoidal Octacyanoquinoid Acceptor Forms Solution and Surface Products by Antiparallel Shape Fitting with Conformational Dipole Momentum Switch</title>

A new compound formed by two antiparallelly disposed tetracyano thienoquinoidal units is synthesized. Such species feature an in&#8208;plane to out&#8208;of&#8208;plane switch of the electric dipole momentum upon adsorption and self&#8208;assembly on Au(111).







Abstract
A new compound (1) formed by two antiparallelly disposed tetracyano thienoquinoidal units has been synthesized and studied by electrochemistry, UV/Vis&#8208;NIR, IR, EPR, and transient spectroscopy. Self&#8208;assembly of 1 on a Au(111) surface has been investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy. Experiments have been rationalized by quantum chemical calculations. 1 exhibits a unique charge distribution in its anionic form, with a gradient of charge yielding a neat molecular in&#8208;plane electric dipole momentum, which transforms out&#8208;of&#8208;plane after surface deposition due to twisted&#8594;folded conformational change and to partial charge transfer from Au(111). Intermolecular van der Waals interactions and antiparallel trapezoidal shape fitting lead to the formation of an optimal dense on Au(111) two&#8208;dimensional assembly of 1.

         <title>A 3D Anionic Metal Covalent Organic Framework with soc Topology Built from an Octahedral TiIV Complex for Photocatalytic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 17881-17886, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Octahedral TiIV complex was used to construct the first 3D anionic titanium&#8208;based COF (Ti&#8208;COF&#8208;1) with the edge transitive (6, 4)&#8208;connected soc topology. Ti&#8208;COF&#8208;1 shows high crystallinity, superior stability, abundant porosity, and high photocatalytic activity for Meerwein addition reactions. This research will extend to enrich the structure and functionality of 3D frameworks.







Abstract
The construction of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) remains challenging due to the limited types of organic building blocks. With octahedral TiIV complex as the building unit, this study reports on the first 3D anionic titanium&#8208;based COF (Ti&#8208;COF&#8208;1) with an edge&#8208;transitive (6, 4)&#8208;connected soc topology. Ti&#8208;COF&#8208;1 exhibits high crystallinity, superior stability, and large specific surface area (1000.4&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1). Moreover, Ti&#8208;COF&#8208;1 has a broad absorption band in the UV spectrum with an optical energy gap of 1.86&#8197;eV, and exhibits high photocatalytic activity toward Meerwein addition reactions. This research demonstrates an attractive strategy for the design of 3D functional COFs.

         <title>Synthesizing Photoluminescent Au28(SCH2Ph&#8208;tBu)22 Nanoclusters with Structural Features by Using a Combined Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 17932-17936, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concurrently joint reduction&#8208;ligand induction method is introduced to synthesize a gold nanocluster Au28(SCH2Ph&#8208;tBu)22 with the best PL quantum yield among hydrophobic thiolated gold nanoclusters so far, probably owing to the enhanced charge transfer from the bi&#8208;ring to the kernel via Au&#8722;Au bonds closely related to the structural features including tritetrahedron kernel with two bridging thiolates and two surface hexamer rings.







Abstract
We present a method for atomically precise nanocluster synthesis. As an illustration, we introduced the reducing&#8208;ligand induction combined method and synthesized a novel nanocluster, which was determined to be Au28(SCH2Ph&#8208;tBu)22 with the same number of gold atoms as existing Au28(SR)20 nanoclusters but different ligands (hetero&#8208;composition&#8208;homo&#8208;size). Compared with the latter, the former has distinct properties and structures. In particular, a novel kernel evolution pattern is reported, i.e., the quasi&#8208;linear growth of Au4&#8208;tetrahedron by sharing one vertex and structural features, including a tritetrahedron kernel with two bridging thiolates and two Au6(SCH2Ph&#8208;tBu)6 hexamer chair&#8208;like rings on the kernel surface were also first reported, which endow Au28(SCH2Ph&#8208;tBu)22 with the best photoluminescence quantum yield among hydrophobic thiolated gold nanoclusters so far, probably due to the enhanced charge transfer from the bi&#8208;ring to the kernel via Au&#8722;Au bonds.

         <title>Decatungstate&#8208;Mediated C(sp3)&#8211;H Heteroarylation via Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover in Batch and Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 17893-17897, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of decatungstate photocatalysis with oxidative radical&#8211;polar crossover is reported. This strategy enables the C(sp3)&#8211;H heteroarylation under mild conditions with excellent functional group tolerance. It was also adopted to enable late&#8208;stage functionalization of valuable compounds. Microflow technology reduced reaction times and boosted productivity of the transformation.







Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen atom transfer is a very powerful strategy for the regioselective C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization of organic molecules. Herein, we report on the unprecedented combination of decatungstate hydrogen atom transfer photocatalysis with the oxidative radical&#8211;polar crossover concept to access the direct net&#8208;oxidative C(sp3)&#8211;H heteroarylation. The present methodology demonstrates a high functional group tolerance (40 examples) and is scalable when using continuous&#8208;flow reactor technology. The developed protocol is also amenable to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of biologically relevant molecules such as stanozolol, (&#8722;)&#8208;ambroxide, podophyllotoxin, and dideoxyribose.

         <title>Spatially Selective Imaging of Mitochondrial MicroRNAs via Optically Programmable Strand Displacement Reactions</title>

An optically controlled DNA nanoreporter technology was reported for imaging of mitochondrial microRNAs in vitro and in vivo. This was accomplished by mitochondria&#8208;targeted localization and near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;initiated programmable strand displacement reactions.







Abstract
MicroRNA (miRNA) functions are tightly regulated by their sub&#8208;compartmental location in living cells, and the ability to imaging of mitochondrial miRNAs (mitomiRs) is essential for understanding of the related pathological processes. However, most existing DNA&#8208;based methods could not be used for this purpose. Here, we report the development of a DNA nanoreporter technology for imaging of mitomiRs in living cells through near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;controlled DNA strand displacement reactions. The sensing function of the DNA nanoreporters are silent (OFF) during the delivery process, but can be photoactivated (ON) with NIR light after targeted mitochondrial localization, enabling spatially&#8208;restricted imaging of two types of cancer&#8208;related mitomiRs with improved detection accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate imaging of mitomiRs in vivo through spatiotemporally&#8208;controlled delivery and activation. Therefore, this study illustrates a simple methodology that may be broadly applicable for investigating the mitomiRs&#8208;associated physiological events.

         <title>Electrochromic Polycationic Organoboronium Macrocycles with Multiple Redox States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 17942-17946, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polycationic organoboronium macrocycles comprising four bipyridylboronium units in a cyclic conjugated framework are introduced, with the boron cations linked by fluorene and two electron&#8208;deficient arylborane or two electron&#8208;rich arylamine moieties. Cyclic voltammetry and spectroelectrochemical studies reveal that multiple redox states can be reversibly accessed with transfer of up to 10&#8197;electrons and switchable electrochromic properties are realized.







Abstract
Polycationic macrocycles are attractive as they display unique molecular switching capabilities arising from their redox properties. Although diverse polycationic macrocycles have been developed, those based on cationic boron systems remain very limited. We present herein the development of novel polycationic macrocycles by introducing organoboronium moieties into a conjugated organoboron macrocyclic framework. These macrocycles consist of four bipyridylboronium units that are connected by fluorene and either electron&#8208;deficient arylborane or electron&#8208;rich arylamine moieties. Electrochemical studies reveal that the macrocycles undergo reversible multi&#8208;step redox processes with transfer of up to 10&#8197;electrons. Switchable electrochromic behavior is demonstrated via spectroelectrochemical studies and the observed color changes are rationalized by correlation with computed electronic transitions using DFT methods.

         <title>Photoelectron Circular Dichroism in the Photodetachment of Amino Acid Anions</title>

Electrospraying allows bringing &#8220;molecular elephants&#8221; into the gas phase, as phrased by J.&#8197;B. Fenn, where subsequent chirality analysis&#8212;in the current example via photoelectron circular dichroism resulting from photodetachment from anions&#8212;reveals the chirality of enantiomers present.







Abstract
The chirality of chemical compounds is of undisputed importance in science and technology. In particular with respect to pharmacological application most molecules of interest cannot be accessed by the powerful techniques developed in recent years for gas phase analytes. Here, we demonstrate that the combination of electrospray ionization (ESI) with the detection of photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) provides access to chirality information applicable to molecular materials with negligible vapor pressure, for example, amino acids. To this end, glutamic acid and 3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) have been electrosprayed into the source of a chirality spectrometer, where photodetachment is enforced and the PECD is detected. The technique can be expected to be conceptually applicable to all chemical systems with chirality based on molecular properties.

         <title>Synthesis of Azaylide&#8208;Based Amphiphiles by the Staudinger Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 17915-17919, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of new amphiphiles through the Staudinger reaction is reported. These azaylide&#8208;based amphiphiles are stable against hydrolysis even in water and form ca. 2&#8197;nm spherical aggregates through self&#8208;assembly. Furthermore, the obtained amphiphiles are capable of encapsulation of hydrophobic organic dyes in water.







Abstract
Catalyst&#8208; and reagent&#8208;free reactions are powerful tools creating various functional molecules and materials. However, such chemical bonds are usually hydrolysable or require specific functional groups, which limits their use in aqueous media. Herein, we report the development of new amphiphiles through the Staudinger reaction. Simple mixing of chlorinated aryl azide with a hydrophilic moiety and various triarylphosphines (PAr3) gave rise to azaylide&#8208;based amphiphiles NPAr3, rapidly and quantitatively. The obtained NPAr3 formed ca. 2&#8197;nm&#8208;sized spherical aggregates (NPAr3)n in water. The hydrolysis of NPAr3 was significantly suppressed as compared with those of non&#8208;chlorinated amphiphiles nNPAr3. Computational studies revealed that the stability is mainly governed by the decrease in LUMO around the phosphorus atom owing to the o&#8208;substituted halogen groups. Furthermore, hydrophobic dyes such as Nile red and BODIPY were encapsulated by the spherical aggregates (NPAr3)n in water.

         <title>The Enantioselective Synthesis of Eburnamonine, Eucophylline, and 16&#8242;&#8208;epi&#8208;Leucophyllidine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 17957-17962, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;convergent&#8211;divergent&#8221; strategy was used to synthesize the dimeric natural product leucophyllidine. An enantioenriched lactam building block was advanced in a divergent fashion to complete syntheses of both eburnamonine and eucophylline in 10 and 16 steps, respectively. A convergent cross&#8208;coupling and hydrogenation sequence was then employed to afford 16&#8242;&#8208;epi&#8208;leucophyllidine (see scheme).







Abstract
A synthetic approach to the heterodimeric bisindole alkaloid leucophyllidine is disclosed herein. An enantioenriched lactam building block, synthesized through palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation, served as the precursor to both hemispheres. The eburnamonine&#8208;derived fragment was synthesized through a Bischler&#8211;Napieralski/hydrogenation approach, while the eucophylline&#8208;derived fragment was synthesized by Friedl&#228;nder quinoline synthesis and two sequential C&#8722;H functionalization steps. A convergent Stille coupling and phenol&#8208;directed hydrogenation united the two monomeric fragments to afford 16&#8242;&#8208;epi&#8208;leucophyllidine in 21 steps from commercial material.

         <title>Chiral Induction in Buckminsterfullerene Using a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 17947-17951, August 9, 2021. </description>

Buckminsterfullerene (C60) is one of the most symmetrical molecules. Nanoconfinement of C60 within a chiral metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) is able to perturb the inherent symmetry of C60 via the host&#8211;guest interactions. As a consequence, C60 confined in the MOF exhibited unprecedented substantial chiroptical properties.







Abstract
Chiral induction is an emerging topic of interest in various areas of chemistry because of its relationship to the elusive mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking in nature. Buckminsterfullerene (C60) with the shape of a highly symmetric truncated icosahedron has rarely been referred for chiral induction due to the difficult symmetry breaking. In this work, we demonstrate that a chiral metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) can provide a key field for chiral induction. C60 could be incorporated into the chiral nanochannels of the MOF using an in situ self&#8208;assembly strategy. The circular dichroism spectra of the resulting nanocomposites showed an intense chiral signal in the absorption region of C60. Experimental and theoretical studies showed that this unprecedented chiral induction of C60 was attributed to hybridization of the molecular orbitals through a close association with the pore surface of the MOF. Our method can endow highly symmetric achiral compounds with chirality, paving the new way toward fabrication of novel chiral nanomaterials.

         <title>A Versatile Silver(I) Pentafluorooxosulfate Reagent for the Synthesis of OSF5 Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 17866-17870, August 9, 2021. </description>

The reaction of AgF with SOF4 in MeCN solution gives rise to solvated AgOSF5, which defines the starting point for a variety of other SF5O compounds. For example, transition metal salts are accessible by metathesis; furthermore, bipyridine&#8208;stabilised AgOSF5 has proven its general utility in the preparation of SF5O&#8208;substituted aromatics. The solid&#8208;state structure of the distorted octahedral [OSF5]&#8722; anion has been revealed by X&#8208;ray crystallography.







Abstract
Herein, we report the preparation of silver(I) pentafluorooxosulfate from commercially available AgF and OSF4. The compound is surprisingly stable in a MeCN solution. Apart from that, AgOSF5 has been stabilised by the addition of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine ligands. Starting from solutions of the unstabilised silver(I) salt, OSF5 complexes with NiII, CuI, and CuII&#8208;centres have been obtained. In addition, AgOSF5 has proven to be generally capable of mediating the transfer of OSF5 groups to aryne moieties, thus furnishing a new and safe method for the preparation of OSF5&#8208;substituted arenes. X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis of selected transition&#8208;metal OSF5 compounds have revealed distorted octahedral [OSF5]&#8722; anions which are extensively stabilised by hydrogen bonding.

         <title>Photoinduced Reversible Semicrystalline&#8208;to&#8208;Amorphous State Transitions of Stereoregular Azopolyesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 17898-17903, August 9, 2021. </description>

The rapid and reversible transition in aggregation structure of stereoregular azopolyesters between the semicrystalline and amorphous states can be easily manipulated via the reversible cis&#8211;trans photoisomerization of the azobenzene moieties in the side chains.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of isotactic azobenzene&#8208;based polyesters (azopolyesters) with main&#8208;chain chirality via highly enantioselective resolution copolymerization of racemic azobenzene&#8208;containing epoxides with cyclic anhydrides. All polyesters with trans&#8208;azobenzene moieties were found to be semicrystalline materials with melting temperatures of 153&#8211;231&#8201;&#176;C, while the corresponding isotactic cis&#8208;azopolyesters were amorphous. The azobenzene groups in the copolymers exhibited reversible trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis and cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans photoisomerization upon irradiation with light. This demonstrates that the crystallinity of isotactic azopolyesters can be manipulated via photoinduced reversible isomerization. In addition, mixing isotactic trans&#8208;polyesters with different enantiomeric configurations in a 1:1 mass ratio afforded crystalline stereocomplexes for which the crystalline behavior differed significantly from those of the component enantiomer. Also, photoinduced reversible transitions between semicrystalline and amorphous states were observed in various stereocomplexes of isotactic trans&#8208;azopolyesters, similar to the isotactic azopolyesters themselves.

Particle&#8208;size reduction of iron sulfide nanoparticles improves its performance as an active material in solid&#8208;state conversion cathodes: For reduced particle dimensions, the electrochemical utilization of FeS2 is increased. The potential of FeS2 as an electrode in solid&#8208;state batteries is highlighted and the importance of the morphological design of battery materials is underscored.







Abstract
Given the inherent performance limitations of intercalation&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries, solid&#8208;state conversion batteries are promising systems for future energy storage. A high specific capacity and natural abundancy make iron disulfide (FeS2) a promising cathode&#8208;active material. In this work, FeS2 nanoparticles were prepared solvothermally. By adjusting the synthesis conditions, samples with average particle diameters between 10&#8197;nm and 35&#8197;nm were synthesized. The electrochemical performance was evaluated in solid&#8208;state cells with a Li&#8208;argyrodite solid electrolyte. While the reduction of FeS2 was found to be irreversible in the initial discharge, a stable cycling of the reduced species was observed subsequently. A positive effect of smaller particle dimensions on FeS2 utilization was identified, which can be attributed to a higher interfacial contact area and shortened diffusion pathways inside the FeS2 particles. These results highlight the general importance of morphological design to exploit the promising theoretical capacity of conversion electrodes in solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Amphiphilic Iodine(III) Reagents for the Lipophilization of Peptides in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 17963-17968, August 9, 2021. </description>

Amphiphilic hypervalent iodine reagents enable the alkynylation of cysteine residues in peptides with lipophilic groups in water. The reaction proceeds in neutral standard buffers with high efficiency for a broad range of peptides and one protein. The thioalkynes can be converted into cleavable thioesters under acidic conditions.







Abstract
We report the functionalization of cysteine residues with lipophilic alkynes bearing a silyl group or an alkyl chain using amphiphilic ethynylbenziodoxolone reagents (EBXs). The reactions were carried out in buffer (pH&#8197;6 to 9), without organic co&#8208;solvent or removal of oxygen, either at 37&#8201;&#176;C or room temperature. The transformation led to a significant increase of peptide lipophilicity and worked for aromatic thiols, homocysteine, cysteine, and peptides containing 4 to 18 amino acids. His6&#8208;Cys&#8208;Ubiquitin was also alkynylated under physiological conditions. Under acidic conditions, the thioalkynes were converted into thioesters, which could be cleaved in the presence of hydroxylamine.

&lt;p&gt;We report the functionalization of cysteine residues with lipophilic alkynes bearing a silyl group or an alkyl chain using amphiphilic ethynylbenziodoxolone reagents (EBXs). The reactions were carried out in buffer (pH&#8197;6 to 9), without organic co-solvent or removal of oxygen, either at 37&#8201;&#176;C or room temperature. The transformation led to a significant increase of peptide lipophilicity and worked for aromatic thiols, homocysteine, cysteine, and peptides containing 4 to 18 amino acids. His&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-Cys-Ubiquitin was also alkynylated under physiological conditions. Under acidic conditions, the thioalkynes were converted into thioesters, which could be cleaved in the presence of hydroxylamine.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>One&#8208;Pot and Shape&#8208;Controlled Synthesis of Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 17904-17909, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot, gram&#8208;scale and shape&#8208;controlled synthesis of two covalent organic cages is presented. They can convert into high&#8208;yielding per&#8208;hydroxylated analogues that exhibit great potential for further modification. The [2]cage can be utilized as gas chromatographic stationary phase for high&#8208;resolution separation of benzene/cyclohexane and toluene/methylcyclohexane.







Abstract
Organic cages are fascinating because of their well&#8208;defined 3D cavities, excellent stability, and accessible post&#8208;modification. However, the synthesis is normally realized by fragment coupling approach in low yields. Herein, we report one&#8208;pot, gram&#8208;scale and shape&#8208;controlled synthesis of two covalent organic cages (box&#8208;shaped [4]cage and triangular prism&#8208;shaped [2]cage) in yields of 46&#8201;% and 52&#8201;%, involving direct condensation of triangular 1,3,5&#8208;tris(2,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl)benzene monomer with paraformaldehyde and isobutyraldehyde, respectively. The cages can convert into high&#8208;yielding per&#8208;hydroxylated analogues. The [2]cage can be utilized as gas chromatographic stationary phase for high&#8208;resolution separation of benzene/cyclohexane and toluene/methylcyclohexane. By changing the central moiety of the triangular monomer and/or aldehyde, this synthetic method would have the potential to be a general strategy to access diverse cages with tunable shape, size, and electronic properties.

         <title>Tailoring the Microporosity of Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity for Advanced Gas Separation by Atomic Layer Deposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 17875-17880, August 9, 2021. </description>

Excellent gas separation performance and suitable stability and mechanical properties are simultaneously obtained via Al2O3 atomic layer deposition on PIM&#8208;1 membranes owing to the strong molecular sieving effect induced by Al2O3 deposition that tailors the polymer microporosity.







Abstract
Tailoring the microporosity of intrinsically microporous polymers at the atomic level is one of the biggest challenges in achieving high&#8208;performance polymeric gas separation membranes. In this study, for the first time, the Al2O3 atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique was used to modify the microporosity of a typical polymer of intrinsic microporosity (PIM&#8208;1) at the atomic level. PIM&#8208;1 with six ALD cycles (PIM&#8208;1&#8208;Al2O3&#8208;6) exhibited simultaneous high thermal, mechanical, pure&#8208; and mixed&#8208;gas separation, and anti&#8208;aging properties. The O2/N2, H2/N2, and H2/CH4 separation performances were adequate above the latest trade&#8208;off lines. PIM&#8208;1&#8208;Al2O3&#8208;6 showed CO2 and O2 permeabilities of 624 and 188&#8197;Barrer, combined with CO2/CH4 and O2/N2 selectivities of 56.2 and 8.8, respectively. This significantly enhanced performance was attributed to the strong size sieving effect induced by the Al2O3 deposition.

         <title>Host&#8211;Guest Interactions in a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Isoreticular Series for Molecular Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 17854-17860, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The search for more efficient and stable catalysts often yields hybrid host&#8211;guest systems. This work rationally engineered a series of metal&#8211;organic frameworks as hosts and selectively positioned guests, a CO2 reduction catalyst and a photosensitizer, on the surface or inside the pores for photocatalytic solar fuel production. The results help understand host&#8211;guest interactions and provide transferrable criteria for material design.







Abstract
A strategy to improve homogeneous molecular catalyst stability, efficiency, and selectivity is the immobilization on supporting surfaces or within host matrices. Herein, we examine the co&#8208;immobilization of a CO2 reduction catalyst [ReBr(CO)3(4,4&#8242;&#8208;dcbpy)] and a photosensitizer [Ru(bpy)2(5,5&#8242;&#8208;dcbpy)]Cl2 using the isoreticular series of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) UiO&#8208;66, &#8208;67, and &#8208;68. Specific host pore size choice enables distinct catalyst and photosensitizer spatial location&#8212;either at the outer MOF particle surface or inside the MOF cavities&#8212;affecting catalyst stability, electronic communication between reaction center and photosensitizer, and consequently the apparent catalytic rates. These results allow for a rational understanding of an optimized supramolecular layout of catalyst, photosensitizer, and host matrix.

Dubnium obeys Mendeleev's periodicity. Fifty years after the discovery of this element, its chemical behavior was experimentally revisited. From the gas chromatographic investigation of the volatile oxychloride compound, a trend of decreasing volatility along Group&#8197;5 elements was deduced, in agreement with the expectations by the laws established in the Periodic Table.







Abstract
The formation and the chemical characterization of single atoms of dubnium (Db, element 105), in the form of its volatile oxychloride, was investigated using the on&#8208;line gas phase chromatography technique, in the temperature range 350&#8211;600&#8201;&#176;C. Under the exactly same chemical conditions, comparative studies with the lighter homologues of Group&#8197;5 in the Periodic Table clearly indicate the volatility sequence being NbOCl3 &gt; TaOCl3 &#8805; DbOCl3. From the obtained experimental results, thermochemical data for DbOCl3 were derived. The present study delivers reliable experimental information for theoretical calculations on chemical properties of transactinides.

A bimetallic core&#8211;shell [Au42Cd40(SR)52]2&#8722; nanocluster is synthesized and its structure is determined. The metal core possesses a Au42 core encaged by a shell of 40 cadmium atoms, which is protected by 52 thiolate ligands. The elucidation of this gold core/cadmium shell nanostructure expands the types of hetero&#8208;structured nanoclusters and promotes the understanding of bimetallic metal&#8208;metal bonding and interactions at the atomic level.







Abstract
Bimetallic core&#8211;shell nanostructures hold great promise in elucidating the bimetallic synergism. However, it remains a challenge to construct atomically precise core&#8211;shell with high&#8208;valence active metals on the gold surface. In this work, we report the total structure of a [Au42Cd40(SR)52]2&#8722; core&#8211;shell nanocluster and multiple implications. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) reveals that the structure possesses a two&#8208;shelled Au6@Au36 core and a closed cadmium shell of Cd40, and the core&#8211;shell structure is then protected by 52 thiolate (&#8208;SR) ligands. The composition of the nanocluster is further confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS). A catalytic test for styrene oxidation and a comparison with relevant nanoclusters reveal the surface effect on the catalytic activity and selectivity.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Carbene Catalysis for the Synthesis of Aliphatic and &#945;&#8208;Amino Ketones</title>

We developed a single&#8208;electron approach for the construction of aliphatic ketones from activated carboxylic acids using merged NHC/photoredox catalysis. Computational studies and mechanistic analysis revealed that reactivity is dependent on both the substrate and NHC catalyst. This methodology was showcased in the direct functionalization of amino acids and bioactive compounds.







Abstract
Single&#8208;electron N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis has gained attention recently for the synthesis of C&#8722;C bonds. Guided by density functional theory and mechanistic analyses, we report the light&#8208;driven synthesis of aliphatic and &#945;&#8208;amino ketones using single&#8208;electron NHC operators. Computational and experimental results reveal that the reactivity of the key radical intermediate is substrate&#8208;dependent and can be modulated through steric and electronic parameters of the NHC. Catalyst potential is harnessed in the visible&#8208;light driven generation of an acyl azolium radical species that undergoes selective coupling with various radical partners to afford diverse ketone products. This methodology is showcased in the direct late&#8208;stage functionalization of amino acids and pharmaceutical compounds, highlighting the utility of single&#8208;electron NHC operators.

         <title>Hypsochromic Shift of Multiple&#8208;Resonance&#8208;Induced Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence by Oxygen Atom Incorporation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 17910-17914, August 9, 2021. </description>

A multiple&#8208;resonance&#8208;induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence material that comprised oxygen, nitrogen, and boron atoms (&#957;&#8208;DABNA&#8208;O&#8208;Me) was synthesized via one&#8208;shot double borylation. An OLED device employing the fabricated &#957;&#8208;DABNA&#8208;O&#8208;Me exhibits deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence with a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum and a high external quantum efficiency with minimum efficiency roll&#8208;off.







Abstract
Herein, we reported an ultrapure blue multiple&#8208;resonance&#8208;induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) material (&#957;&#8208;DABNA&#8208;O&#8208;Me) with a high photoluminescence quantum yield and a large rate constant for reverse intersystem crossing. Because of restricted &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the HOMO rather than the LUMO induced by oxygen atom incorporation, &#957;&#8208;DABNA&#8208;O&#8208;Me shows a hypsochromic shift compared to the parent MR&#8208;TADF material (&#957;&#8208;DABNA). An organic light&#8208;emitting diode based on this material exhibits an emission at 465&#8197;nm, with a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 23&#8197;nm and Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage coordinates of (0.13, 0.10), and a high maximum external quantum efficiency of 29.5&#8201;%. Moreover, &#957;&#8208;DABNA&#8208;O&#8208;Me facilitates a drastically improved efficiency roll&#8208;off and a device lifetime compared to &#957;&#8208;DABNA, which demonstrates significant potential of the oxygen atom incorporation strategy.

Post&#8208;synthetic modification of diamondoid MOF SHF&#8208;61 generates its methylamide analogue [(Me2NH2)[In(BDC&#8208;NH(CO)Me)], SHF&#8208;62, as single crystals. Resulting ligand steric demands and H&#8208;bonding capability lead to a change in dimensionality of the MOF breathing behaviour from 2D breathing (pore width) to 3D breathing (pore width and length), which has been mapped by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.







Abstract
Post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) of the interpenetrated diamondoid metal&#8211;organic framework (Me2NH2)[In(BDC&#8208;NH2)2] (BDC&#8208;NH2=aminobenzenedicarboxylate) SHF&#8208;61 proceeds quantitatively in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal manner to yield the acetamide derivative (Me2NH2)[In(BDC&#8208;NHC(O)Me)2] SHF&#8208;62. Continuous breathing behaviour during activation/desolvation is retained upon PSM, but pore closing now leads to ring&#8208;flipping to avert steric clash of amide methyl groups of the modified ligands. This triggers a reduction in the amplitude of the breathing deformation in the two dimensions associated with pore diameter, but a large increase in the third dimension associated with pore length. The MOF is thereby converted from predominantly 2D breathing (in SHF&#8208;61) to a distinctly 3D breathing motion (in SHF&#8208;62) indicating a decoupling of the pore&#8208;width and pore&#8208;length breathing motions. These breathing motions have been mapped by a series of single&#8208;crystal diffraction studies.

         <title>Direct detection of surface species formed on iridium electrocatalysts during the oxygen evolution reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The effect of surface orientations on the formation of iridium oxide species during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains yet unknown. In this study, we use a needle&#8208;shaped iridium atom probe specimen as a nanosized working electrode to ascertain the role of the surface orientations in the formation of oxide species during OER. At the beginning of electrolysis, the top 2&#8208;3&#160;nm of (024), (026), (113) and (115) planes are covered by IrO&#8208;OH, which activates all surfaces towards OER. A thick sub&#8208;surface oxide layer consisting of sub&#8208;stoichiometric Ir&#8208;O species is formed on the open (024) planes as OER proceeds. Such metastable Ir&#8208;O species are thought to provide an additional contribution to the OER activity. Overall, this study sheds light on the importance of the morphological effects of iridium electrocatalysts for OER. It also provides an innovative approach that can directly reveal surface species on electrocatalysts at atomic scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Base&#8208;Activated Latent Heteroaromatic Sulfinates as Nucleophilic Coupling Partners in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heteroaromatic sulfinates are effective nucleophilic reagents in Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions with aryl halides.&#160;However, metal sulfinate salts can be challenging to&#160;purify, solubilize in reaction media, and are not tolerant to multi&#8208;step transformations.&#160;Here we introduce base&#8208;activated, latent sulfinate reagents;&#160;&#946;&#8208;nitrile and &#946;&#8208;ester sulfones. We show that under the cross&#8208;coupling conditions, these species eliminate to generate the sulfinate salt&#160;in situ, which then undergoes efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed desulfinative cross&#8208;coupling with (hetero)aryl bromides to deliver a broad range of biaryls. These latent sulfinate reagents have proven to be stable through multi&#8208;step substrate elaboration, and amenable to scale&#8208;up.</dc:description>

         <title>Radically Enhanced Dual Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Complexation between a viologen radical cation (  V  &#8226;+  ) and cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;  p  &#8208;phenylene) diradical dication (  CBPQT  2(&#8226;+)  ) has been investigated and utilized extensively in the construction of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) and artificial molecular machines (AMMs). The selective recognition of two  V  &#8226;+  &#160;using radical&#8208;pairing interactions, however, remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the efficient encapsulation of two methyl viologen radical cations (  MV  &#8226;+  ) in a size&#8208;matched bisradical dicationic host&#8212;namely, cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;2,6&#8208;naphthalene)  2(&#8226;+)  , i.e.,  CBPQN  2(&#8226;+)  . Central to this dual recognition process was the choice of 2,6&#8208;bismethylenenaphthalene linkers for incorporation into the bisradical dicationic host. They provide the space between the two bipyridinium radical cationic units&#160;in  CBPQN  2(&#8226;+)  suitable for binding two  MV  &#8226;+  &#160;with relatively short (3.05&#8211;3.25 &#197;) radical&#8208;pairing distances. The radical host was found to exhibit highly selective and cooperative association&#160;with the two  MV  &#8226;+  &#160;in MeCN at room temperature. The formation of the tetrakisradical tetracationic inclusion complex&#8212;namely, [  (MV)  2  &#8834;  CBPQN]  4(&#8226;+  )  &#8212;in MeCN was confirmed by VT&#160;  1  H NMR, as well as by EPR, spectroscopy. The solid&#8208;state superstructure of [  (MV)  2  &#8834;  CBPQN]  4(&#8226;+  )  reveals an uneven distribution of the binding distances (3.05, 3.24, 3.05 &#197;) between the three different  V  &#8226;+  , suggesting that localization of the radical&#8208;pairing interactions has a strong influence on the packing of the two  MV  &#8226;+  &#160;inside the radical host.&#160;Our findings constitute a rare example of binding two radical guests with high affinity and cooperativity using host&#8208;guest radical&#8208;pairing interactions. Moreover, they open up possibilities of harnessing the tetrakisradical tetracationic inclusion complex as a new, orthogonal and redox&#8208;switchable recognition motif for the construction of MIMs and AMMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Sono&#8208;Fenton Chemistry Converts Phenol&#8208; and Phenyl&#8208;Derivatives into Polyphenols for Engineering Surface Coatings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyphenol&#8208;based supramolecular assembly has attracted interest for engineering a range of functional surface coatings. Herein, we report a sono&#8208;Fenton strategy to mediate the supramolecular assembly of metal&#8211;phenolic networks (MPNs) as substrate&#8208;independent coatings using phenol and phenyl derivatives as building blocks. The assembly process is initiated from the generation of hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) using high&#8208;frequency ultrasound (412 kHz), while the metal ions synergistically participate in the production of additional &#8226;OH for hydroxylation/phenolation of phenol and phenyl derivatives via the Fenton reaction and also coordinate with the phenolic compounds for film formation. The coating strategy is applicable to various phenol and phenyl derivatives (from small molecules to biological macromolecules containing phenol groups) and different metal ions including Fe(II), Fe(III), Cu(II), and Co(II). In addition, the sono&#8208;Fenton strategy allows real&#8208;time control over the assembly process by turning the high&#8208;frequency ultrasound on or off. Importantly, the properties (e.g., radical scavenging and antibacterial activity) of the building blocks are maintained in the formed films. This work provides an environmentally friendly and controllable method to expand the application of phenolic coatings for the surface engineering of diverse materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct NO Reduction by a Biomimetic Iron(II) Pyrazolate MOF</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) containing one&#8208;dimensional, Fe2+  chains bridged by dipyrazolate linkers and  N,N  &#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) ligands has been synthesized. The unusual chain&#8208;type metal nodes feature accessible coordination sites on adjacent metal centers, resulting in motifs that are reminiscent of the active sites in non&#8208;heme diiron enzymes. The MOF facilitates direct reduction of nitric oxide (NO), producing nearly quantitative yields of nitrous oxide (N2O) and emulating the reactivity of flavodiiron nitric oxide reductases (FNORs). The ferrous form of the MOF can be regenerated via a synthetic cycle involving reduction with cobaltocene (CoCp2) followed by reaction with trimethylsilyl triflate (TMSOTf).</dc:description>

         <title>New Mechanistic and Reaction Pathway Insights for Oxidative Coupling of Methane (OCM) over Supported Na2WO4/SiO2 Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The complex structure of the catalytic active phase, and surface&#8208;gas reaction networks have hindered understanding of the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) reaction mechanism by supported Na  2  WO  4  /SiO  2  catalysts. The present study demonstrates, with the aid of  in&#8208;situ  Raman and chemical probe (H  2  &#8208;TPR, TAP and steady&#8208;state kinetics) experiments, that the long speculated crystalline Na  2  WO  4  active phase is unstable and melts under OCM reaction conditions, partially transforming to thermally stable dispersed surface Na&#8208;WO  x  sites. Kinetic analysis via temporal analysis of products (TAP) and steady&#8208;state OCM reaction studies demonstrate that (  i  ) surface Na&#8208;WO  x  sites are responsible for selectively activating CH  4  to C  2  H  x  and over&#8208;oxidizing CH  y  to CO and (  ii  ) molten Na  2  WO  4  phase is mainly responsible for over&#8208;oxidation of CH  4  to CO  2  and also assists in oxidative dehydrogenation of C  2  H  6  to C  2  H  4  . These new insights reveal the nature of catalytic active sites and resolve the OCM reaction mechanism over supported Na  2  WO  4  /SiO  2  catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Laterally Engineering Ln&#8208;MOFs Epitaxial Heterostructures for Spatially Resolved Planar 2D Photonic Barcoding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) heterostructures with domain&#8208;controlled emissive colors have shown great potential for achieving high&#8208;throughput sensing, anti&#8208;counterfeit and information security.&#160; Here, a strategy based on steric&#8208;hindrance effect is proposed to construct lateral lanthanide&#8208;MOFs (Ln&#8208;MOFs) epitaxial heterostructures, where the channel&#8208;directed guest molecules are introduced to rebalance in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane growth rates of the Ln&#8208;MOFs microrods and eventually generate lateral MOF epitaxial heterostructures with controllable aspect ratios. A library of lateral Ln&#8208;MOFs heterostructures are acquired through a stepwise epitaxial growth procedure, from which rational modulation of each domain with specific lanthanide doping species allows for definition of photonic barcodes in a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) domain with remarkably enlarged encoding capacity. The results provide molecular&#8208;level insight into the use of modulators in governing crystallite morphology for spatially assembling multifunctional heterostructures.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective and highly sensitive quantification of gut microbiome and human metabolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The microbiome has a fundamental impact on the human host&#8217;s physiology through the production of highly reactive compounds that can lead to disease development. One class of such compounds are carbonyl&#8208;containing metabolites, which are involved in diverse biochemical processes. Mass spectrometry is the method of choice for analysis of metabolites but carbonyls are analytically challenging.&#160;Herein, we have developed a new chemical biology tool using chemoselective modification to overcome analytical limitations. Two isotopic probes allow for the simultaneous and semi&#8208;quantitative analysis at&#160;femto&#8208; and attomole quantities, and detection of more than 200 metabolites in human fecal, urine and plasma samples. This comprehensive mass spectrometric analysis enhances the scope of metabolomics&#8208;driven biomarker discovery. We anticipate that our Chemical Biology tool will be of general use in metabolomics analysis to obtain a better understanding of microbial interactions with the human host and disease development.</dc:description>

         <title>Hard X&#8208;ray Nanotomography for 3D Analysis of Coking in Nickel&#8208;based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding catalyst deactivation by coking is crucial for knowledge&#8208;based catalyst and process design in reactions with carbonaceous species. Post&#8208;mortem analysis of catalyst coking is often performed by bulk characterization methods. Here hard X&#8208;ray ptychographic computed tomography (PXCT) was used to study Ni/Al2O3 catalysts for CO2 methanation and CH4 dry reforming after artificial coking treatment. PXCT generated quantitative 3D maps of local electron density at ca. 80 nm resolution, allowing to visualize and evaluate the severity of coking in entire catalyst particles of ca. 40 &#181;m diameter. Coking was&#160;primarily revealed in the nanoporous solid, which was not detectable in resolved macropores. Coke formation was independently confirmed by operando Raman spectroscopy. PXCT is highlighted as an emerging characterization tool for nanoscale identification, co&#8208;localization, and potentially quantification of deactivation phenomena in 3D space within entire catalyst particles.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies to avoid artifacts in mass spectrometry&#8208;based epitranscriptome analyses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this report, we perform structure validation of recently reported RNA phosphorothioate (PT) modifications, a new set of epitranscriptome marks found in bacteria and eukaryotes including humans. By comparing synthetic PT&#8208;containing diribonucleotides with native species in RNA hydrolysates by high resolution mass spectrometry (MS), metabolic stable isotope labeling, and PT&#8208;specific iodine&#8208;desulfurization, we disprove the existence of PTs in RNA from  E.  &#160;  coli  ,  S. cerevisiae  , human cell lines, and mouse brain. Furthermore, we discuss how an MS artifact led to the initial misidentification of 2&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;methylated diribonucleotides as RNA phosphorothioates. To aid structure validation, we present a detailed guideline for MS analysis of RNA hydrolysates, emphasizing how the chosen RNA hydrolysis protocol can be a decisive factor in discovering and quantifying RNA modifications in biological samples.</dc:description>

         <title>The voltage dependent sidedness of the reprotonation of the retinal Schiff base determines the unique inward pumping of Xenorhodopsin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The new class of microbial rhodopsins, called xenorhodopsins (XeRs) (1), extends the versatility of this family by inward H  +  pumps (2&#8211;4). These pumps are an alternative optogenetic tool to the light&#8208;gated ion channels (e.g. ChR1,2), because the activation of electrically excitable cells by XeRs is independent from the surrounding physiological conditions. In this work we functionally and spectroscopically characterized XeR from Nanosalina (  Ns  XeR) (1). The photodynamic behavior of  Ns  XeR was investigated on the ps to s time scale elucidating the formation of the J and K and a previously unknown long&#8208;lived intermediate. The pH dependent kinetics reveal that alkalization of the surrounding medium accelerates the photocycle and the pump turnover. In patch&#8208;clamp experiments the blue&#8208;light illumination of  Ns  XeR in the M state shows a potential&#8208;dependent vectoriality of the photocurrent transients, suggesting a variable accessibility of reprotonation of the retinal Schiff base. Insights on the kinetically independent switching mechanism could furthermore be obtained by mutational studies on the putative intracellular H  +  acceptor D220.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Electrosynthetic Hydrocarboxylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Esters with Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The carboxylation of low value commodity chemicals to&#160;provide higher value carboxylic acids is of significant interest.&#160;Recently alternative routes to the traditional hydroformylation&#160;processes that used potentially toxic carbon monoxide and a&#160;transition metal catalyst have appeared. A significant challenge has&#160;been the selectivity observed for olefin carboxylation. Photochemical&#160;methods have shown a viable route towards the hydrocarboxylation&#160;of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated alkenes but rely on the use of an excess sulfur or&#160;amine reagent. Herein we report our investigations of an&#160;electrochemical approach that is able to hydrocarboxylate a,bunsaturated&#160;alkenes with excellent regioselectivity and the ability to&#160;carboxylate hindered substrates to afford &#945;&#8208;quaternary centre&#160;carboxylic acids. The reported process requires no chromatography&#160;and the products are purified by simple crystallisation from the&#160;reaction mixture after work up.</dc:description>

Herein we report our investigations of an&#160;electrochemical approach that is able to hydrocarboxylate a,bunsaturated&#160;alkenes with excellent regioselectivity and the ability to&#160;carboxylate hindered substrates to afford &#945;-quaternary centre&#160;carboxylic acids. The reported process requires no chromatography&#160;and the products are purified by simple crystallisation from the&#160;reaction mixture after work up.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Advanced Electrolyte Design for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Li Metal Batteries under Practical Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given the limitation inherent in current intercalation&#8208;based Li&#8208;ion batteries, much research attentions have focused on the potential successor of Li&#8208;ion batteries such as Lithium Sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries and Lithium oxygen (Li&#8208;O2) batteries. In order to realize the potential of these batteries, the use of metallic Lithium as anode is essential. Nevertheless, the growth of Li dendrites accompanied with severe safety hazards hinder the practical application of Li metal anode. Another obstacle that hinders the practical application of Li metal anode is the formation of &#8220;dead Li&#8221; during cycles, which causes inevitable active Li loss. Hence, a large amount of inventory metallic Li is needed to prolong the cycle life of Li metal batteries. However, largely excessive Li in the anode is undoubtedly detrimental to the actual energy density of Li metal batteries. For Li metal batteries under practical conditions, low negative/positive ratio (N/P ratio), electrolyte/cathode ratio (E/C ratio) accompanied with high&#8208;voltage cathode is perquisite. In this reviews, we summarize the development of new electrolyte systems for Li metal batteries under practical conditions, revisit the design criteria of advanced electrolyte for practical Li metal batteries and provide perspectives on future development of electrolyte for practical Li metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Intermetallic FePt@PtBi Core&#8211;Shell Nanoparticles for Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of active and stable platinum (Pt)&#8208;based oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts with good resistance to poisoning is a prerequisite for widespread practical application of fuel cells. One effective strategy for enhancing the electrocatalytic performance is to tune or control the physicochemical state of the Pt surface. Here, we demonstrate a general surface&#8208;engineering approach to prepare a range of nanostructured Pt alloys by coating chemically ordered intermetallic phases with alloy&#160;PtBi shells. FePt@PtBi core&#8211;shell nanoparticles&#160;showed the best ORR performance with a mass activity of 0.96 A mg  Pt  &#8211;1  and a specific activity of 2.06 mA cm  &#8211;2  , respectively 7 times and 11 times those of the corresponding values for benchmark Pt/C. Moreover, FePt@PtBi shows much better tolerance to methanol and carbon monoxide than conventional Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts. The observed comprehensive enhancement in ORR performance of FePt@PtBi can be attributed to the increased compressive strain of the Pt surface due to in&#8208;plane shearing resulting from the presence of the large Bi atoms in the surface&#8208;structured PtBi overlayers, as well as charge displacement via Pt&#8722;Bi bonding which mitigates crossover issues.</dc:description>

         <title>Decarboxylation&#8208;Induced Defects in MOF&#8208;Derived Single Co Atom@Carbon Electrocatalysts for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing transition metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is of great importance. Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) as a subgroup of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are distinguished as SAC precursors, due to their large porosity and N content. However, the activity of the formed metal sites is limited. Herein, we reported a decarboxylation&#8208;induced defects strategy to improve their intrinsic activity via increasing the defect density. Carboxylate/amide mixed&#8208;linker MOF (DMOF) was chosen to produce defective Co SACs (Co@DMOF) by gas&#8208;transport of Co species to DMOF upon heating. Comparing with ZIF&#8208;8 derived SAC (Co@ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;900), Co@DMOF&#8208;900 with more defects yet one fifth Co content and similar specific double&#8208;layer capacitance shows better ORR activity and eight times higher turnover frequency (2.015 e s  &#8211;1  site  &#8211;1  ). Quantum calculation confirms the defects can weaken the adsorption free energy of OOH on Co sites and further boost the ORR process.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The asymmetric synthesis of enantiopure pyrrolidines is reported via a streamlined strategy relying on two sequential C&#8211;H functionalizations of simple hydrocarbons. The first step is a regio&#8208; and stereoselective catalytic nitrene C&#8211;H insertion. Then, a subsequent diastereoselective cyclization involving a 1,5&#8208;Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) from a&#160;  N  &#8208;centered radical leads to the formation of pyrrolidines that can then be converted to their free&#160;  NH&#8208;  derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Defect of Lithium Metal in Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery with Li metal anode is a promising rechargeable battery technology with high energy density and improved safety. Currently, the application of Li metal anode is plagued by the failure at the interfaces between lithium metal and solid electrolyte (SE). However, little is known about the defects at Li&#8211;SE interfaces and their effects on Li cycling, impeding further improvement of Li metal anodes. Here, by performing large&#8208;scale atomistic modeling of Li metal interfaces with common SEs, we discover that lithium metal forms an interfacial defect layer of nanometer&#8208;thin disordered lithium at the Li&#8211;SE interfaces. This interfacial defect Li layer is highly detrimental, leading to interfacial failure such as pore formation and contact loss during Li stripping. By systematically studying and comparing incoherent, coherent, and semi&#8208;coherent Li&#8211;SE interfaces, we find that the interface with good lattice coherence has reduced Li defects at the interface and has suppressed interfacial failure during Li cycling. Our finding discovers the critical roles of atomistic lithium defects at interfaces for the interfacial failure of Li metal anode, and motivates future atomistic&#8208;level interfacial engineering for Li metal anode in solid&#8208;state batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery and characterization of spike N&#8208;terminal domain&#8208;binding aptamers for rapid SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#8208;19) pandemic has devastated families and disrupted healthcare, economies and societies across the globe. Molecular recognition agents that are specific for distinct viral proteins are critical components for rapid diagnostics and targeted therapeutics. In this work, we demonstrate the selection of novel DNA aptamers that bind to the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike glycoprotein with high specificity and affinity (&lt; 80 nM). Through binding assays and high resolution cryo&#8208;EM, we demonstrate that SNAP1 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein N&#8208;terminal domain&#8208;binding aptamer 1) binds to the S N&#8208;terminal domain. We applied SNAP1 in lateral flow assays (LFAs) and ELISAs to detect UV&#8208;inactivated SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 at concentrations as low as 10  6  copies/mL. SNAP1 is therefore a promising molecular tool for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 diagnostics.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing ammonia quantification minefield in photo/electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photo/electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis&#8212;a low&#8208;carbon and sustainable process has developed fast over the past decade while the ammonia yields over state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photo/electrocatalysts are still very moderate. Such low concentration of synthesized NH  3  brings about a challenge to the reliable quantification of the product in photo/electrocatalysis. Notably, we found that the quantitative detection of ammonia concentration below 0.2 ppm is error&#8208;prone, which is likely the case happening in the majority of photo/electrocatalytic NH  3  synthesis, thus arising concerns about the rationality and accuracy for low&#8208;concentration ammonia quantification in these processes. Herein, we discuss the methodology used and analyze the reliability of various detection methods for the detection of trace ammonia in aqueous media. By regulating the parameters of detection methods, the experimental detection limitation can be expanded from 0.2 ppm to 0.1 ppm, even lower. The challenges facing the detection of low concentration of ammonia in photo/electrocatalysis can be overcome by integration with multiple detection methods. According to the data presented, we also propose an effective criterion for precise quantification of ammonia, avoiding the unreasonable comparisons in photo/electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;pressure CO electroreduction at silver produces ethanol and propanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reducing CO  2  to long&#8208;chain carbon products is attractive considering such products are typically more valuable than shorter ones. However, the best electrocatalyst for making such products from CO  2  , copper, lacks selectivity. By studying alternate C2+ producing catalysts we can increase our mechanistic understanding, which is beneficial for improving catalyst performance. Therefore, we investigate CO reduction on silver, as density functional theory (DFT) results predict it to be good at forming ethanol. To address the current disagreement between DFT and experimental results (ethanol vs. no ethanol), we investigated CO reduction at higher surface coverage (by increasing pressure) to ascertain if desorption effects can explain the discrepancy. In terms of product trends, our results agree with the DFT&#8208;proposed acetaldehyde&#8208;like intermediate, yielding ethanol and propanol as C2+ products &#8211; making the CO  2  electrochemistry of silver very similar to copper at sufficiently high coverage.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid and Direct Photocatalytic C(sp3)&#8210;H Acylation and Arylation in Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a photocatalytic procedure that enables the acylation/arylation of unfunctionalized alkyl derivatives in flow. The method exploits the ability of the decatungstate anion to act as a hydrogen atom abstractor and produce nucleophilic carbon&#8208;centered radicals that are intercepted by a nickel catalyst to ultimately forge C(sp  3  )&#8210;C(sp  2  ) bonds. Owing to the intensified conditions in flow, the reaction time can be reduced from 12&#8208;48 hours to only 5&#8208;15 minutes. Finally, kinetic measurements highlight how the intensified conditions do not change the reaction mechanism but reliably speed up the overall process.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral distorted hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes bearing a nonagon&#8208;embedded carbohelicene.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new family of chiral saddle&#8208;helix hybrid nanographenes is reported. The first hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) analogues bearing a nine&#8208;membered carbocycle are presented. Furthermore, for the first time, &#960;&#8208;extended carbo[n]helicenes containing a nine&#8208;membered ring as part of the helical moiety have been synthesized. The combination of a [5]helicene moiety and a nonagon ring in a single chiral motif induces a tremendous distortion from planarity into the nanographenic structures compared to other saddle&#8208;helix hybrids such as heptagon&#8208; and octagon&#8208;containing &#960;&#8208;extended carbo[5]helicenes. In fact, the interplanar angle of the two terminal rings reaches the largest angle (134.8&#176;) of a carbohelicene reported to date, thus being by far the most twisted helicene yet prepared. Photophysical properties evaluation showed improved absorption dissymmetry factors (|gabs| = 4.2 &#215; 10&#8211;3) in the new family of nonagon&#8208;containing &#960;&#8208;extended carbo[5]helicenes.</dc:description>
