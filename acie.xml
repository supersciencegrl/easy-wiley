         <title>Redox&#8208;Activated Probes Enable High&#8208;Contrast Live Imaging of Native Postsynaptic Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sylives are modified fluorescent peptides for high&#8208;contrast live imaging of inhibitory (gephyrin) and excitatory (PSD&#8208;95) postsynaptic scaffolds in native neurons. Clean labeling requires low nanomolar probe levels, whereas uptake needs micromolar cell&#8208;penetrating peptide (CPP). Redox&#8208;triggered CPP masking and release reconciles both, enabling efficient delivery with low&#8208;background staining.








ABSTRACT
Direct visualization of postsynaptic scaffolds in living neurons is essential for dissecting synaptic dynamics and plasticity. Existing methods for live synapse visualization have major constraints, relying on genetic engineering or multistep application of live&#8208;cell incompatible antibodies or nanobodies. Available affinity probes and delivery strategies lack the required contrast due to incomplete or excess delivery. Here, we introduce Sylives, a set of compact, synthetic fluorescent peptides that enable high&#8208;contrast live imaging of inhibitory (gephyrin) and excitatory (PSD&#8208;95) postsynaptic scaffolds in native neurons. Critically, by pre&#8208;purification of the redox&#8208;cleavable CPP&#8208;probe conjugate we overcome side&#8208;product formation of in&#8208;situ coupling strategies, achieving reliable cytosolic delivery and restored scaffold binding after intracellular reduction. The Sylive design addresses the need for nanomolar probe levels versus micromolar CPP for clean labelling and efficient delivery by decoupling targeting and uptake. Through quantitative evaluation of uptake and off&#8208;target binding, we defined a transferrable parameter space for effective intracellular delivery. Near traceless Sylive uptake and target specificity are validated by direct comparison to transiently expressed proteins and immunolabeling in fixed neurons. The reduction&#8208;sensitive Sylive conjugates enable high&#8208;contrast, specificity&#8208;restored labelling of endogenous postsynaptic sites without genetic modification and offer a modular platform for targeting alternative intracellular proteins in living primary neurons.

         <title>Ethane Chlorination Toward Vinyl Chloride Synthesis: Mechanistic and Catalytic Perspectives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ethane chlorination is emerging as a promising low&#8208;carbon route to vinyl chloride monomer, yet it remains academically underexplored due to the complexity of radical chemistry. As the first focused Minireview on this topic, it offers forward&#8208;looking mechanistic analysis, unveils catalyst evolution pathways, and defines research priorities to accelerate breakthroughs in this nascent but critical field.








ABSTRACT
Ethane chlorination has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional ethylene&#8208; and acetylene&#8208;based routes for the production of vinyl chloride monomer (VCM). Unlike conventional catalytic processes, this approach relies on chlorine radical&#8208;mediated activation to convert ethane into 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane, followed by thermal cracking to VCM. However, this route remains in its early stages, hindered by the complexity of gas&#8208;phase radical chemistry and catalyst deactivation under chlorination conditions. This review provides a critical assessment of the mechanistic foundations of ethane chlorination, highlighting the interplay between radical&#8208;mediated and surface&#8208;catalyzed pathways. Particular attention is given to advances in rare&#8208;earth oxychloride catalysts, which have shown the ability to stabilize key intermediates. We also discuss major deactivation mechanisms, including phase transformation and surface hydroxylation, that limit catalyst lifetime. Furthermore, we highlight the feasibility of ethane chlorination as a low&#8208;carbon VCM production route under future decarbonized energy scenarios. Finally, key directions in catalyst design, mechanistic understanding, and process integration are outlined to advance ethane chlorination from laboratory&#8208;scale innovation to industrial reality.

         <title>A Metallosupramolecular Receptor for Squaraine Dyes Enabling Ultrafast Dark Resonance Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metallosupramolecular receptor binds squaraine dyes with high affinity and enables efficient dark resonance energy transfer (DRET) that generates bright near&#8208;infrared emission with large pseudo&#8208;Stokes shifts.








ABSTRACT
A metal&#8208;organic cage was obtained by combining acridone&#8208;based dipyridyl ligands with Pd2+ ions. The cage acts as a potent receptor for squaraine dyes, with a pronounced preference for guests with 2,6&#8208;dihydroxyphenyl substituents. This selectivity profile differs from that of previously reported receptors for squaraine dyes. The acridone&#8208;based cage itself is non&#8208;emissive. Upon its photoexcitation, ultrafast (sub&#8208;ps) dark resonance energy transfer (DRET) to the encapsulated squaraine dyes was observed, resulting in bright, near&#8208;infrared guest emission, with pseudo&#8208;Stokes shifts of up to 440&#160;nm. Upon binding of a chiral dye, chirality transfer to the host could be evidenced by circular dichroism spectroscopy.

         <title>Proton Tautomerism for Anhydrous Superprotonic Conduction in 1,2,3&#8208;Triazolium Dihydrogen Phosphate Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates the contribution of proton tautomerism to solid&#8208;state proton conduction and achieves isotropic superprotonic conduction in acid&#8211;base single crystals. Specifically, low&#8208;barrier isotropic superprotonic conductivity exceeding 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 is achieved in a cocrystal of 1,2,3&#8208;triazole and phosphoric acid. We demonstrate proton tautomerism as a new guideline for anhydrous proton conduction, as an alternative to molecular motion. 








ABSTRACT
Proton dynamics within molecular organic solids are crucial for energy&#8208;related technologies. Proton conductors for use as solid electrolytes in hydrogen fuel cells have been developed, elucidating the higher proton transport mechanism and establishing design guidelines for higher conduction. Many anhydrous proton conductors for proton transport utilizing molecular motion in solids have been studied; however, low&#8208;barrier conduction is challenging. In this study, we addressed proton tautomerism as a new guideline for proton conduction, rather than molecular motion. The key to facilitating low&#8208;barrier conduction is proton transport without molecular motion via dynamic interconversion between multiple tautomers. We demonstrated the effectiveness of proton&#8208;tautomerism strategy in 1,2,3&#8208;triazole dihydrogen phosphate crystal, which exhibited low&#8208;barrier, isotropic superprotonic conductivity exceeding 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1. Both theoretical and experimental results confirmed that superprotonic conduction originates from proton tautomerism, demonstrating for the first time that proton tautomerism can serve as a design guide for highly efficient anhydrous proton conductors.

         <title>Living Polymerization Strategy for Conjugated Multiblock Copolymers: A Systematic Study of Structure&#8211;Property Relationships in Stretchability and Charge Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study systematically elucidates how living polymerization enables molecular&#8208;level control over key structural parameters&#8212;molecular weight, dispersity, and end&#8208;group fidelity&#8212;leading to conjugated multiblock copolymers that simultaneously achieve ultrahigh stretchability (&gt;300%) and optimized charge carrier mobility.








ABSTRACT
Achieving high mechanical stretchability while maintaining charge carrier mobility in semiconducting polymers remains a central challenge due to their intrinsic trade&#8208;off. Conjugated multiblock copolymers (CMPs) incorporating semiconducting and elastomeric segments represent a promising design strategy to overcome this limitation, yet a systematic understanding of how structural parameters influence material properties and device performances is still lacking. To address this issue, we chose a model polymer, poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) (P3HT), and systematically constructed its library precursors with independently varied molecular weight, dispersity, and end&#8208;group fidelity. Then, these precursors were incorporated into CMPs containing flexible polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) over a broad composition range (0&#8211;75 mol%). As a result, this design enabled deconvolution of the individual effects of each structural parameter on CMP performance. Notably, CMPs incorporating well&#8208;defined P3HT blocks exhibited significantly enhanced stretchability (&gt;300%) while retaining high hole mobility, in contrast to those prepared using P3HT from uncontrolled polymerization. These results underscore the advantage of living polymerization in precisely tailoring conjugated polymer architectures and optimizing the mechanical and electronic properties of stretchable semiconducting materials, while also offering a platform that may be extended to other conjugated polymers.

Notably, CMPs incorporating well-defined P3HT blocks exhibited significantly enhanced stretchability (&amp;gt;300%) while retaining high hole mobility, in contrast to those prepared using P3HT from uncontrolled polymerization. These results underscore the advantage of living polymerization in precisely tailoring conjugated polymer architectures and optimizing the mechanical and electronic properties of stretchable semiconducting materials, while also offering a platform that may be extended to other conjugated polymers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Carbocation Functionalization by Catalytic Transchalcogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acid&#8208;generated carbocations are selectively trapped by sulfide and selenide donor molecules in the form of onium salts. Through manipulation of one of the donor's substituents, these onium salts undergo elimination towards the corresponding transchalcogenation products. This strategy enables the shuttling of toxic S and Se moieties, while providing a rational platform to improve reaction selectivity in carbocation functionalization.








ABSTRACT
Introducing functionalities via acid&#8208;mediated carbocation chemistry is conceptually straightforward, but typically lacks in selectivity and broad&#8208;scale applicability, which is further hampered by the need for toxic reaction partners. Here, we show that small S&#8208; and Se&#8208;based functionalities can be selectively and safely introduced into feedstock molecules via acid&#8208;catalyzed transchalcogenation reactions. A designable y&#8208;keto donor compound delivers the functionality through the formation of a trialkyl chalcogenonium intermediate that is prone to elimination in conjunction with the acid catalyst and its counteranion. We demonstrate how this strategy enables chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselective construction of C(sp3)&#9472;S and &#9472;Se bonds, offering clear advantages over classical acid&#8208;catalyzed carbocation functionalization.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Competitive Selection in a Protein&#8208;Catalyzed Dissipative Peptide Replication</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structurally flexible protein catalyzes replication within a dissipative reaction network driven by UVA&#8208;induced disulfide rearrangements. The protein accelerates templated autocatalytic cycles with replication emerging as the dominant pathway. Competition among replicators for limited catalyst binding sites enables light intensity&#8208;dependent competitive selection.








ABSTRACT
Theoretical models of prebiotic evolution propose that catalytic modulation can influence autocatalytic replication cycles. We hypothesized that a protein catalyst could create a favorable environment for proximity&#8208;controlled, dissipative replication of primitive peptides. This setup, in principle, allows competitive selection by making the catalyst a limited resource. Here, we show that a structurally flexible and promiscuous protein, calmodulin, catalyzes UVA light&#8208;driven replication in a helical foldamer&#8208;based replicator system. The protein accelerates both non&#8208;autocatalytic synthesis and autocatalytic replication, with autocatalysis being the dominant pathway. The system demonstrates light&#8208;intensity&#8208;dependent competitive selection, where replicators compete for scarce binding sites on the catalyst. This mechanism enables efficient selection even within a large replicator pool. Our results provide evidence that the specific catalyst&#8211;replicator interactions envisioned in Eigen's hypercycle model can be approximated under dissipative conditions in catalyzed primitive replicator systems.

         <title>pH&#8208;Mediated Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction Construction Through Dynamic Fermi Level Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;stimuli strategy was developed that couples pH adjustment with ultrasonication to construct a strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) in aqueous media via dynamic Fermi&#8208;level regulation. In situ pH&#8208;induced charge redistribution at the metal&#8211;support boundary enables controlled encapsulation of metal nanoparticles. The resulting catalysts feature adjustable SMSI strength and exhibit improved activity and selectivity in hydrogenation.








ABSTRACT
The metal&#8211;support interface is central to governing catalytic transformations. While strong metal&#8211;support interaction (SMSI) is an established strategy to tailor the morphology and electronic properties of supported metal catalysts, the role of interfacial charge redistribution in SMSI formation remains poorly understood and rarely leveraged. Here, we report a dual&#8208;stimuli approach that combines pH modulation with ultrasonication to mediate SMSI construction in aqueous solution through dynamic Fermi level tuning. By leveraging in situ pH&#8208;driven charge redistribution at the metal&#8211;support interface, we achieve controllable SMSI encapsulation of metal nanoparticles, as verified by electrochemical analysis, work function measurements, and x&#8208;ray&#8208;based techniques. The resulting catalysts exhibit tunable SMSI features and deliver enhanced activity and selectivity in hydrogenation reactions. This work establishes a facile strategy to modulate catalyst structure and electronic properties by exploiting Fermi level variation as a driving force, thereby advancing rational SMSI design and catalytic performance across diverse environments.

         <title>Conformation&#8208;Resolved Single&#8208;Luminogen Systems for Time&#8208;Dependent Multicolor Afterglow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy regarding conformation&#8208;resolved single&#8208;luminogen systems with dual&#8208;phosphorescence that integrates flexible C&#8211;S&#8211;C rotors into a rigid pyrene core to obtain stable and flexible conformations with different triplet energy levels was presented, and thus leading to intrinsic dual&#8208;phosphorescence and resulting in material that exhibits a time&#8208;dependent multicolor afterglow transition from red to yellow, and finally to green.








ABSTRACT
Time&#8208;dependent multicolor afterglow enables temporal encoding of naked&#8208;eye distinguishable optical signals that cannot be achieved with static luminescence. However, available strategies to control the wavelength and color of time&#8208;dependent multicolor afterglow remain highly limited. Herein, we propose a conformation&#8208;resolved molecular design that successfully unlocks intrinsic dual&#8208;phosphorescence characteristics in single&#8208;luminogen systems, enabling dynamically color&#8208;tunable afterglow within the polymer matrix. Our strategy integrates flexible C&#8211;S&#8211;C rotors into a rigid pyrene core, allowing simultaneous stabilization of distinct emissive conformers with different triplet energy levels, specifically, a parallel conformer that can produce red phosphorescence and a perpendicular one yielding green phosphorescence. The asynchronous decay of these phosphorescent afterglows results in a visually perceptible emission color transition from red to yellow, and finally to green over a naked&#8208;eye distinguishable time scale, representing a rare paradigm of intrinsic, conformation&#8208;mediated dual&#8208;phosphorescence. Moreover, our systems are able to exhibit remarkable resistance to water, acids/bases, and organic solvents, as well as intrinsic UV&#8208;shielding capabilities, demonstrating that the time&#8208;dependent multicolor afterglow can readily integrate with diverse material functionalities, and is thus well suited for a wide range of application scenarios.

         <title>Mechanically Triggered Chemical Recyclable Polyethylene&#8208;Like Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyethylene&#8208;like copolymers with benchmark properties are prepared by embedding latent cyclobutene mechanophores to overcome PE's end&#8208;of&#8208;life limits. The mechanophores are inert in service but are selectively opened by solvent&#8208;free ball milling to yield well&#8208;defined telechelic oligomers. After ethanolysis/hydrogenation, these oligomers are repolymerized to cross&#8208;linked PE with commercial&#8208;grade properties, enabling a practical closed&#8208;loop circularity. 








ABSTRACT
Polyethylene (PE) materials are indispensable to modern infrastructure due to their exceptional thermal, mechanical, and chemical resilience. However, the same properties that make these materials durable also render them environmentally persistent and unrecyclable by conventional means, posing a critical sustainability challenge. Here, we report a mechanochemically triggered, chemically recyclable PE&#8208;like system that enables the closed&#8208;loop recycling of cross&#8208;linked polyethylene (XLPE). Through palladium&#8208;catalyzed coordination copolymerization of ethylene with the cyclobutene&#8208;fused ester (CBE) comonomer, polar PE&#8208;like materials with tunable properties are achieved. Upon optimal mechanical activation in the presence of a radical inhibitor, the CBE units undergo ring opening, installing ester linkages into the polymer backbone. Notably, the high crystallinity of copolymers with low CBE content enables ball&#8208;milling to achieve activation efficiency comparable to cryo&#8208;milling. Subsequent ethanolysis of ester linkages cleanly converts the initial copolymer into multifunctional oligomers, which can be repolymerized after hydrogenation via transesterification to yield a recyclable XLPE with properties comparable to a commercial analogue. This work demonstrates a robust platform for reconciling the durability and recyclability of polyethylene, offering a transformative route toward sustainable polyolefins.

         <title>Regulating Both In&#8208;Plane and Out&#8208;Of&#8208;Plane Supramolecular Interactions in COFs for Simultaneously Enhanced Crystallinity and Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Both in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane supramolecular interactions are regulated to strengthen interlayer stacking of COFs. Such a multi&#8208;dimensional supramolecular&#8208;based strategy endows the COFs with simultaneously enhanced crystallinity and stability, which in turn significantly improves the performance of COFs in ion sieving applications under harsh conditions.








ABSTRACT
The demand for high&#8208;performance applications of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) under harsh conditions drives the need for reaching both outstanding crystallinity and high stability, while these two properties necessitate contradictory structural features and are thus challenging to achieve simultaneously. We herein report a multidimensional supramolecular approach to manipulating both crystallinity and stability of COFs by harnessing in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane interactions with greatly enhanced performance in applications. The introduction of triple three&#8208;center hydrogen bonds into the linkage enhances in&#8208;plane local rigidity and planarity, while embedding electron&#8208;withdrawing heteroatoms into the linker mitigates out&#8208;of&#8208;plane electrostatic repulsion. The integration of the two structural features into a single COF results in profoundly enhanced interlayer &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions, ultimately providing considerably higher crystallinity and stability than those of control COFs, as well as significantly improved performance under harsh conditions, as exemplified by palladium separation from simulated high&#8208;level liquid waste. This work establishes a hybrid supramolecular approach to improving both crystallinity and stability of COFs toward prominent applications.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Limonoids Enabled by Sterically Assisted Boron Chain&#8208;Walking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective strategy for limonoid synthesis utilizes a Hajos&#8211;Parrish ketone derivative to rapidly assemble the tetracyclic core. A novel sterically assisted hydroboration/boron chain&#8208;walking/oxidation protocol enables challenging late&#8208;stage remote C&#8211;H hydroxylation in sterically congested polycyclic scaffolds. This approach achieved total syntheses of (+)&#8208;azadiradione (17 steps LLS) and (&#8211;)&#8208;7&#8208;desacetyl&#8208;7&#8208;benzoylazadiradione (15 steps LLS). This establishes a unified entry to limonoid family and a versatile solution for site&#8208;selective functionalization in complex natural products.








ABSTRACT
Limonoids are architecturally complex tetranortriterpenoids with diverse biological activities, yet their synthetic inaccessibility has limited detailed investigations. Here, we report an enantioselective strategy that enables efficient access to intact limonoids. Our approach begins with a readily available Hajos&#8211;Parrish ketone derivative and rapidly assembles the tetracyclic core of the target scaffold. Central to this route is a novel sterically assisted hydroboration/boron chain&#8208;walking/oxidation protocol, which achieves a challenging late&#8208;stage remote C&#8211;H hydroxylation in a highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective manner within sterically congested polycyclic scaffolds. This strategy has enabled the total syntheses of (+)&#8208;azadiradione and (&#8722;)&#8208;7&#8208;desacetyl&#8208;7&#8208;benzoylazadiradione. These studies provide a unified entry to multiple limonoid families and establish a broadly applicable solution for site&#8208;selective late&#8208;stage functionalization in complex natural product frameworks.

         <title>Crown Ether Rotaxane&#8208;Induced Construction of COF Membranes With Recognition Channels for High&#8208;Efficiency Ion Sieving</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic membrane with high ion recognition capability is constructed by inducing the oriented stacking of COF nanosheets using crown ether rotaxanes. Compared with the reported membranes, it features a precise pore structure and channel microenvironment with appropriate binding strength. The target ions undergo selective dehydration at the pore entrance and intrapore hopping transport, achieving efficient ion sieving. 








ABSTRACT
Biological ion channels can achieve high ion discrimination through the synergy between pore structure and microenvironment. However, constructing biomimetic ion&#8208;sieving membranes with precise recognition capabilities for target ions remains challenging. Herein, we propose a rotaxane&#8208;induced stacking method for constructing COF membranes integrated with ion&#8208;recognition sub&#8208;nanoscale channels. The dibenzo&#8208;crown ether rotaxane COF (CRCOF) nanosheets are fabricated and subsequently stacked into membranes. Driven by &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between rotaxane moieties and CRCOF nanosheets, as well as the specific ion&#8208;recognition ability of rotaxanes, the nanosheets undergo oriented stacking, yielding well&#8208;defined sub&#8208;nanoscale channels equipped with recognition sites. The angstrom&#8208;scale pore size and specific binding channels synergistically enhance selectivity and minimize transport energy penalties of target ions. By modulating the ion recognition capability of channels, the obtained CRCOF membrane demonstrates an exceptional Li+ permeation rate of 0.04&#160;mol m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 (approximately five times higher than reported polymer membranes) and high Li+ selectivity (Li+/Mg2+ selectivity of 315 and Li+/Na+ selectivity of 12) in a mixture solution. This work provides a new avenue for the accurate construction of biomimetic ion&#8208;sieving membranes and offers new insights into the mechanisms of high&#8208;efficiency ion separation in sub&#8208;nanoscale confined recognition channels.

         <title>Confining a Single Water Molecule Through Molecular Crystal Engineering for Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through molecular crystal engineering, isolated water monomers are obtained, minimizing the influence of hydrogen&#8208;bond networks in water clusters on water activation and facilitating the oxidation of monomeric water to hydrogen peroxide.








ABSTRACT
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded water clusters (H2O)n obscure the intrinsic reactivity of monomeric H2O (n = 1) by restricting molecular reorientation. Elucidating the catalytic behavior of isolated water remains a key challenge in aqueous&#8208;phase chemistry. Here, we address this by designing a molecular crystal that uniformly confines single water molecules in identical tetrahedral cavities. This platform, CB&#8208;H2O, exhibits exceptional activity for photocatalytic H2O&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2 conversion, achieving 7.03&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with pure water, representing an 11.6&#8208;fold enhancement over cavity&#8208;deficient controls and being markedly superior to existing photocatalytic systems. This performance advantage is directly attributed to the crystallographically defined monomeric water, as verified by isotopic labelling and in&#8208;situ spectroscopy. Theoretical calculations further demonstrate that cavity confinement eliminates hydrogen&#8208;bond reorganization penalties, substantially lowering the activation barrier for water oxidation. Our work establishes monomeric&#8208;water catalysis as a distinct and efficient paradigm, showcasing molecular crystal engineering as a versatile approach to tailoring water&#8208;involved reactions for sustainable catalysis.

         <title>Ultralow&#8208;Potential Photoelectrochemical Synthesis of Hydroxylamine and Oximes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have synthesized a bimetallic Bi&#8208; and Cu&#8208;modified TiO2/CdS/Sb2(S,Se)3 photocathode, achieving a Faradaic efficiency of 91.9% and a selectivity of 92.7% for the conversion of nitrate to hydroxylamine. This approach not only provides a viable route to hydroxylamine but has also been systematically extended to produce diverse oxime derivatives, thereby demonstrating its broad applicability in nitrate reduction processes.








Abstract
The efficient and environmentally friendly synthesis of hydroxylamine (NH2OH) remains a challenge in sustainable chemical production. Electrochemical nitrate reduction to NH2OH suffers from dependence on external hydrogen sources, which often lead to the nitrite accumulation or over&#8208;reduction of NH2OH to ammonia due to unbalanced hydrogenation intensity. Herein, we report the photoelectrochemical nitrate reduction to NH2OH (PENRH) using a bimetallic Bi&#8208; and Cu&#8208;modified TiO2/CdS/Sb2(S,Se)3 semiconductor. Under AM 1.5&#160;G illumination, the resulting photocathode achieves a Faradaic efficiency of 91.9% and a selectivity of 92.7% at 0.3 VRHE for NH2OH, while effectively suppressing side reactions. In situ characterization and theoretical calculations reveal that the synergy between Bi and Cu sites optimizes the adsorption of intermediates, promotes NO3&#8722; protonation, and facilitates the rapid desorption of NH2OH, thereby preventing its over&#8208;reduction. This system is successfully extended to the oxime synthesis by coupling in situ generated NH2OH with aldehydes or ketones, enabling efficient preparation of various oximes and demonstrating the broad applicability of PENRH. This work not only introduces a green photoelectrochemical approach for NH2OH synthesis, but also offers a new paradigm for the resource utilization of nitrate.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The efficient and environmentally friendly synthesis of hydroxylamine (NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH) remains a challenge in sustainable chemical production. Electrochemical nitrate reduction to NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH suffers from dependence on external hydrogen sources, which often lead to the nitrite accumulation or over-reduction of NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH to ammonia due to unbalanced hydrogenation intensity. Herein, we report the photoelectrochemical nitrate reduction to NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH (PENRH) using a bimetallic Bi- and Cu-modified TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CdS/Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(S,Se)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; semiconductor. Under AM 1.5&#160;G illumination, the resulting photocathode achieves a Faradaic efficiency of 91.9% and a selectivity of 92.7% at 0.3 V&lt;sub&gt;RHE&lt;/sub&gt; for NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH, while effectively suppressing side reactions. In situ characterization and theoretical calculations reveal that the synergy between Bi and Cu sites optimizes the adsorption of intermediates, promotes NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; protonation, and facilitates the rapid desorption of NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH, thereby preventing its over-reduction. This system is successfully extended to the oxime synthesis by coupling in situ generated NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH with aldehydes or ketones, enabling efficient preparation of various oximes and demonstrating the broad applicability of PENRH. This work not only introduces a green photoelectrochemical approach for NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH synthesis, but also offers a new paradigm for the resource utilization of nitrate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Piezoelectric Polarization Optimized Photocharge Separation and Surface Proton Cycling for Efficient Pure Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual&#8208;group approach successfully increased the dipole moment of C3N5 and successfully formed specific charge transfer channels, significantly enhancing the efficiency of carrier separation. Under the action of external stress, it can optimize surface proton cycling and facilitate the generation of free radicals, leading to the formation of H2O2, thereby achieving piezo&#8208;photocatalytic water splitting.








ABSTRACT
The simultaneous production of hydrogen (H2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from pure water represents an ideal solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical pathway for sustainable fuel and oxidant generation. However, conventional photocatalysts face intrinsic limitations, including sluggish carrier dynamics and insufficient power for water oxidation. Herein, we unveil an intramolecular electron transfer pathway from cyano groups to hydroxyl groups in C3N5 that creates a high&#8208;performance piezo&#8208;photocatalyst for water splitting. The hydroxyl/cyano groups direct electron&#8208;hole flow, optimizing the surface potential and dipole moment (DM) for a stronger piezoelectric response. Interestingly, the piezoelectric polarization induced by mechanical strain in MCN&#8208;8 enhances its H+ desorption ability to facilitate a rapid adsorption&#8208;reaction&#8208;desorption process. In situ infrared spectroscopy results indicate that MCN&#8208;8 generates key substances such as &#183;O2&#8722; and &#183;OOH, clarifying the water oxidation process. Thus, the rates of H2 and H2O2 release by its piezo&#8208;photocatalysis were 4.14&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and 1.39&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, respectively. Under simulated outdoor sunlight and ultrasonic conditions, the as&#8208;fabricated MCN&#8208;8/PVDF&#8208;HFP composite film retains its ability to produce H2 and H2O2. This strategy of enhancing the piezo&#8208;photocatalytic performance through surface group modulation provides a new idea for the development of highly efficient and multifunctional water decomposition catalysts.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Nitrogen Multi&#8208;Resonance Framework With Heptagon&#8208;Fused Carbazole and Spiro&#8208;Locking Units Enables Extremely Long&#8208;Lifetime Narrowband Green OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic molecular design strategy combining boron&#8208;nitrogen (BN) multi&#8208;resonance frameworks with heptagon&#8208;fused carbazole (HpCz) and spiro&#8208;locking units yields highly stable, purely fluorescent narrowband green emitter. The HpCz&#8208;spiro synergy reinforces rigidity and suppresses degradation, enabling OLED with narrow emission, high external quantum efficiency of 27.7%, and long operational lifetime (LT90) of 17,811&#160;h at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2.








ABSTRACT
Achieving high efficiency, narrow emission bandwidth, and long operational stability simultaneously remains a major challenge for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) in ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition (UHD) displays. Herein, we report a synergistic molecular design integrating boron&#8211;nitrogen&#8208;based multiple resonance (MR) frameworks with &#960;&#8208;extended heptagon&#8208;fused carbazole (HpCz) and dibenzo&#8208;carbazole (DBCz) units, reinforced by a spiro&#8208;locking architecture. This dual strategy enhances molecular rigidity, suppresses vibronic coupling, and improves chemical stability. The resulting emitters, DBCzB&#8208;Fl and HpCzB&#8208;Fl, exhibit narrow green emission with full&#8208;widths at half&#8208;maximum of 26 (0.114&#160;eV) and 22&#160;nm (0.080&#160;eV), respectively. OLEDs based on HpCzB&#8208;Fl achieve an external quantum efficiency of 27.7%, a current efficiency of 113.0 cd&#183;A&#8722;1, a power efficiency of 126.8 lm&#183;W&#8722;1, and an operational lifetime (LT90 at 1000 cd&#183;m&#8722;2) of 17811&#160;h, which is 2.3 times longer than its DBCz analogue. The superior performance and stability arise from the HpCz&#8211;spiro synergy, offering a robust design paradigm for stabilizing MR frameworks while maintaining spectral precision for next&#8208;generation UHD display technologies.

         <title>Area&#8208;Selective Atomic Layer Deposition of AlOx at the Buried Interface for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AlOx precisely targets and covers NiOx areas uncovered by self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAM), avoiding deposition on SAM. This selective passivation preserves efficient hole transport through SAM&#8208;covered areas while suppressing charge recombination and adverse reactions at the buried interface. Additionally, AlOx enhances perovskite film quality. As a result, optimized PSCs achieve a PCE of 26.41%. 








ABSTRACT
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAM) have demonstrated significant potential for enhancing the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, their incomplete surface coverage exposes defect sites on the NiOx surface, leading to detrimental non&#8208;radiative recombination and exacerbating the perovskite degradation. To overcome these limitations, we developed a strategy of area&#8208;selective atomic layer deposition (AS&#8208;ALD) that precisely deposits an ultrathin AlOx layer on exposed NiOx surfaces while preserving SAM&#8208;covered areas. This approach effectively suppresses charge recombination by blocking direct contact between NiOx and the perovskite while leveraging the intrinsic negative fixed charges in AlOx to attract holes and repel electrons. Importantly, the SAM&#8208;covered areas remain unaffected, ensuring unhindered carrier extraction. Additionally, the deposited AlOx reduces the deleterious Ni4+ content, which can readily trigger perovskite decomposition, thereby significantly enhancing device performance and stability. As a result, the PCE of PSCs increased to 26.41%, with perovskite modules achieving 20.88% efficiency over a 64.68 cm2 active area. Device stability significantly improved with &#8764; 95% initial PCE retained after 1500&#160;h dark storage (ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;1), &#8764; 80% after 800&#160;h at 85&#176;C (ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;2), &#8764; 85% after 48 thermal cycles (ISOS&#8208;T&#8208;1), and &#8764; 90% after 1300&#160;h continuous 1&#8208;sun illumination (ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1, MPPT).

         <title>Reaction Discovery Involving Digital co&#8208;Expert with a Practical Application in Atom&#8208;Economic Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid human&#8211;AI workflow accelerates reaction discovery by &#8764;180&#8208;fold. Starting from a 134k compound dataset, machine learning filters and clusters 30600 cycloaddition candidates into 205 high&#8208;priority reactions. Expert evaluation and density functional theory (DFT) optimization guide experimental validation, leading to two novel silver&#8208;catalyzed cycloadditions and demonstrating practical digital co&#8208;expert integration within current research infrastructure.








Abstract
The discovery of new chemical transformations is central to advancing modern chemistry, yet conventional approaches often require months or years of extensive experimental screening. Here, we present a machine&#8208;learning&#8208;assisted and expert&#8208;guided pipeline for reaction discovery applied to the search for atom&#8208;economic cycloaddition reactions. Candidate reactions were generated from publicly available quantum chemical data, filtered through unsupervised machine learning, and clustered to reduce redundancy. A digital co&#8208;expert then enabled rapid prioritization, after which human expertise provided final selection and experimental validation. This hybrid workflow is fully compatible with current laboratory infrastructure and addresses the most time&#8208;consuming stage of reaction discovery, accelerating the expert screening bottleneck by approximately 180&#8208;fold (from&#160;&gt;&#160;1200 days to 7 days). Within &#8764;1 week, two novel cycloaddition reactions were identified and experimentally confirmed, yielding previously undescribed products. While fully autonomous robotic platforms represent a long&#8208;term vision, their high cost and limited availability restrict immediate application. In contrast, our approach demonstrates the practicality of human&#8208;AI collaboration for reaction discovery, combining computational screening, machine learning and expert knowledge to efficiently expand the accessible chemical space.

Expert evaluation and density functional theory (DFT) optimization guide experimental validation, leading to two novel silver-catalyzed cycloadditions and demonstrating practical digital co-expert integration within current research infrastructure.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of new chemical transformations is central to advancing modern chemistry, yet conventional approaches often require months or years of extensive experimental screening. Here, we present a machine-learning-assisted and expert-guided pipeline for reaction discovery applied to the search for atom-economic cycloaddition reactions. Candidate reactions were generated from publicly available quantum chemical data, filtered through unsupervised machine learning, and clustered to reduce redundancy. A digital co-expert then enabled rapid prioritization, after which human expertise provided final selection and experimental validation. This hybrid workflow is fully compatible with current laboratory infrastructure and addresses the most time-consuming stage of reaction discovery, accelerating the expert screening bottleneck by approximately 180-fold (from&#160;&amp;gt;&#160;1200 days to 7 days). Within &#8764;1 week, two novel cycloaddition reactions were identified and experimentally confirmed, yielding previously undescribed products. While fully autonomous robotic platforms represent a long-term vision, their high cost and limited availability restrict immediate application. In contrast, our approach demonstrates the practicality of human-AI collaboration for reaction discovery, combining computational screening, machine learning and expert knowledge to efficiently expand the accessible chemical space.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sustainable Ammonia Electrosynthesis Coupled With Glycerol Valorization via an Adaptive Tri&#8208;Component Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8208;Ni&#8208;W tri&#8208;component catalyst enables efficient nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion under pulsed electrolysis. Combined experimental and theoretical studies attribute its performance to component synergism and regulated intermediates. Its facile adaptation for glycerol valorization to formic acid underscores a versatile system design concept, advancing electrochemical coupling strategies for a broad spectrum of industrially relevant reactions.








ABSTRACT
Electrochemical nitrate reduction represents a promising route for sustainable ammonia (NH3) production, yet its practical deployment is constrained by the limited efficiency of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts and immature system architectures. Here, we report a generalist copper&#8211;nickel&#8211;tungsten tri&#8208;component tandem electrocatalyst via a sequential microwave&#8208;hydrothermal deposition route. Under pulsed electrolysis conditions, the catalyst delivers a remarkable Faradaic efficiency of 97.1% and a record&#8208;high ammonia yield rate of 43.87&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. Online differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) identifies key intermediates and associated pathways, while density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidate the cooperative roles of each component: the copper component facilitates nitrate adsorption and deoxygenation, the nickel component promotes water dissociation for steady *H supply, and the tungsten component serves as a dynamic *H reservoir. This synergy efficiently suppresses hydrogen evolution and enhances ammonia selectivity. Furthermore, coupling with glycerol valorization (to formic acid) as the anodic reaction demonstrates the potential for energy&#8208;efficient ammonia electrosynthesis. Collectively, this work offers both design strategies and mechanistic understanding for next&#8208;generation multi&#8208;component tandem electrocatalysts targeting advanced nitrogen&#8208;based chemical synthesis.

         <title>Dynamic Color&#8208;Tunable Dual Room Temperature Phosphorescence via Activation of Both Host and Guest Triplet States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual RTP system is proposed that synergistically activates host and guest triplet radiative channels via thermally activated reverse triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer (rTTET). Modulating the host's triplet energy levels at the aggregate level via alkyl engineering promotes the rTTET. Benefiting from the dual RTP, dynamically tunable phosphorescence colors, controllable host&#8208;to&#8208;guest phosphorescence ratio, and widely tunable lifetimes were achieved. 








ABSTRACT
The design of dual organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from both the host and guest remains a significant challenge, as most organic doping systems generally enable either the guest or the host to serve as a single static phosphorescent emitter. Here we report a host&#8211;guest dual RTP system featuring dynamically tunable colors, controllable host&#8208;to&#8208;guest phosphorescence ratios, and widely tunable lifetimes of 18.8&#8211;472&#160;ms. This unique performance is enabled by bidirectional triplet energy transfer processes between host and guest, which not only activates RTP of the host molecules but also induces a blue shift of the phosphorescence from 673 to 528&#160;nm, with CIE chromaticity coordinates ranging from (0.51, 0.45) to (0.40, 0.57). More importantly, alkyl ring groups effectively modulate the triplet energy levels of the identical &#960;&#8208;conjugated host molecules at the aggregate level, resulting in the lowest triplet energy levels of host crystals ranging from 2.88 to 2.53&#160;eV. This work provides a unique insight into achieving dual RTP in organic doping systems and holds great potential for applications in multilevel information encryption and optoelectronics research.

         <title>Substituent&#8208;Induced Secondary Interactions Reprogram Ion Permselectivity in Cationic Covalent Organic Framework Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing simple neutral groups into the membrane, we tune its local electrostatic environment, reversing charge preference and enabling selective cation or anion transport without altering the main framework. This strategy yields a membrane stack that efficiently converts thermal gradients into electricity with record&#8208;breaking performance.








ABSTRACT
Precise modulation of ion permselectivity in synthetic membranes is crucial for advancing separation and energy conversion technologies. Here, we demonstrate that neutral substituents can reprogram the intrinsic ion selectivity of cationic covalent organic framework (COF) membranes by introducing secondary local interactions that compete with long&#8208;range Coulombic forces. Using triaminoguanidinium&#8208;based COFs as a model system, we systematically varied both the number and type of substituents on 1,3,5&#8208;trialdehyde linkers. The introduced substituents generated secondary interactions that modulated the primary Coulombic interactions between guanidinium cations and Cl&#8211; counterions. When two or more hydroxyl groups were present on the aldehyde linkers, these interactions immobilized anions and inverted the effective surface potential from positive to negative, thereby switching the transport polarity from anion&#8208; to cation&#8208;selective behavior. In contrast, methoxy substitution weakened Coulombic interactions, enhancing anion selectivity. This tunable control over the local chemical microenvironment enabled programmable and reversible ion permselectivity without altering the permanent framework charge. Leveraging this mechanism, we achieved record&#8208;high ionic thermoelectric performance, 25.9&#160;W m&#8722;2 for a single membrane and 39.1&#160;W m&#8722;2 for a stacked configuration under a 50 K temperature gradient. This work establishes substituent&#8208;mediated secondary interactions as a general and powerful strategy for programming ion transport, bridging biological selectivity principles with the design of adaptive COF&#8208;based membranes for energy harvesting and separation.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Synthesis of Planar&#8208;Chiral Macrocycles via De Novo Isoquinoline Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a highly efficient synthesis of planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles via CpRh(III)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular asymmetric [4+2] annulation reaction of imines with alkynes. The atroposelective de novo isoquinoline ring formation was utilized in this process. The detailed mechanistic studies revealed the rate&#8208;determining step of the reaction and the origin of enantioselectivity. 








ABSTRACT
De novo formation of the aromatic ring is an attractive strategy for atroposelective synthesis, but its application to planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles remains challenging. Herein, we report a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles via de novo isoquinoline construction. This method is characterized by high levels of enantioselectivity (up to 96% ee), regioselectivity (up to &gt;20:1 rr), and functional group tolerance, providing a series of isoquinoline&#8208;based macrocyclic atropisomers. Furthermore, the synthetic utility of this protocol is validated via a mmol&#8208;scale reaction and post&#8208;modification process of the product. Mechanistic studies, including deuterium labeling, kinetic isotope effect, and DFT calculations, support C&#9472;H bond cleavage as the rate&#8208;determining step and elucidate the origin of the stereoselectivity.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Scale Architecture Regulation of Hard Carbons for High&#8208;Efficiency Sodium Storage Across Ambient and Subzero Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;scale structural regulation strategy enables precise tailoring of hard carbon architectures at micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;scales. The pitch&#8208;modulated carbonization directs the self&#8208;assembly of polyphosphazene (PZS) precursors into monodisperse microparticles while in situ forming nanoscale short&#8208;range&#8208;ordered graphitic domains. The resulting hard carbons demonstrate excellent electrochemical performance for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) under both ambient and subzero conditions.








ABSTRACT
Hard carbons, despite their cost&#8208;efficient production and precursor availability, face critical electrochemical performance constraints from excessive defects, limited closed&#8208;pore structures, and poor interfacial stability.

&lt;p&gt;A multi-scale structural regulation strategy enables precise tailoring of hard carbon architectures at micro- and nano-scales. The pitch-modulated carbonization directs the self-assembly of polyphosphazene (PZS) precursors into monodisperse microparticles while in situ forming nanoscale short-range-ordered graphitic domains. The resulting hard carbons demonstrate excellent electrochemical performance for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) under both ambient and subzero conditions.

&lt;p&gt;Hard carbons, despite their cost-efficient production and precursor availability, face critical electrochemical performance constraints from excessive defects, limited closed-pore structures, and poor interfacial stability.

         <title>Pyridine Into Pyrrole Transformation Induced Within the Confinement of the Macrocycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the nontrivial reactivity of pyridine incorporated into a porphyrin framework. The most significant achievement is the contraction of the six&#8208;membered ring to a pyrrole ring, which is a phenomenon of great interest to researchers in this field. In addition, under controlled and mild conditions, the reversible formation of C&#8211;O bonds and the coordination of the outer gold ion are also observed.








ABSTRACT
The pyridine contracted to form the pyrrole ring. This transformation belongs to a unique class of reactions with the fundamental characteristic of the cleavage of the aromatic structure. By investigating the unusual coordination chemistry of N&#8208;confused pyriporphyrin with silver and gold ions, we observed this process and obtained several complexes that exhibited remarkable reactivity. This includes the reversible cleavage of C&#8211;O bonds and the selective demetallation of the outer metal ion.

         <title>Regulating Lithium Bond to Reduce Polysulfide Parasitic Reactivity for High&#8208;Stability Lithium Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Weak cation interaction is proposed to mitigate the intrinsic lithium polysulfide parasitic reactivity toward 500&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 long&#8208;cycling lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries following the lithium bond theory. Ammonium cation with weaker polarizing power than Li+ is introduced to interact with lithium polysulfides, thereby elevating their lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels and suppressing the detrimental parasitic reactions at lithium metal anodes.








ABSTRACT
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries hold great potential as high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy storage devices, yet their practical application is hindered by rapid cycling failure caused by parasitic reactions between lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and lithium metal anodes. Inspired by lithium bond chemistry, we herein propose a weak cation interaction strategy as a new molecular design principle to intrinsically mitigate the parasitic reactivity of LiPSs and endow long&#8208;cycling Li&#8211;S batteries operating at 500&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 level. Specifically, molecular&#8208;level interaction regulation is introduced by employing ammonium cation (NH4+) with weaker polarizing power than Li+ to interact with LiPSs, thereby attenuating their electrophilicity, elevating their lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels, and suppressing the detrimental parasitic reactions with lithium metal anodes. This regulation strategy markedly prolongs the lifespan of Li&#8211;S coin cells from 53 to 149 cycles under harsh conditions of using 4.2&#160;mg cm&#8722;2&#8208;loading sulfur cathodes and 50&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thick lithium anodes. More importantly, an 8 Ah&#8208;level Li&#8211;S pouch cell achieves a high initial energy density of 502&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and stable 16 cycles. This work establishes a new weak cation interaction regulation strategy following lithium bond chemistry, offering a generalizable route toward long&#8208;cycling and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Electron Cloud Polarization of Single&#8208;Atom Cu Boosts Electrocatalytic Reduction of High&#8208; and Low&#8208;Concentration CO2 to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient Cu single&#8208;atom catalyst (CuN3&#8722;C) with polar electron cloud enables high&#8208;rate CO2 electroreduction to CH3OH, achieving 80% Faradaic efficiency and 0.57 &#181;mol s&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 production rate via enhanced *CO hydrogenation.








ABSTRACT
Catalysis of the conversion of CO2 from industrial exhaust gases to methanol at dynamically varying concentrations using renewable electrical energy is crucial for reducing CO2 emissions and producing valuable chemical feedstocks. However, the challenges associated with the weak activation of linear nonpolar CO2 molecules and the high energy difference of key proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer steps make it difficult for existing catalysts to simultaneously achieve a high current density and a high selectivity. Herein, we report a strategy for regulating electron polarization in a Cu single&#8208;atom catalyst (CuN3&#8208;C) to achieve efficient electrocatalytic reduction of high&#8208; and low&#8208;concentration CO2 to CH3OH. For both high&#8208;concentration or low&#8208;concentration CO2 used as the feedstock, the CuN3&#8208;C catalyst achieves a current density exceeding &#8722;450&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, a Faradaic efficiency of 80% for methanol production, and record&#8208;high production rate of 0.57&#160;&#181;mol s&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. In situ characterization and theoretical calculations jointly show that strong electron polarization of the CuN3&#8208;C catalyst facilitates more effective CO2 activation and preferential *CO hydrogenation toward *CHO and *CHOH. This study provides a strategy for designing highly efficient catalysts for the conversion of CO2 to methanol via electronic polarization modulation.

         <title>Deciphering the Transition From Tunneling to Band&#8208;Like Transport in Protein&#8208;Templated Biohybrid Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Embedding atomically precise metal nanoclusters within a protein scaffold induces a metal&#8208;dependent evolution from tunneling to band&#8208;like charge transport, governed by cluster size, orbital delocalization, and protein&#8208;metal electronic coupling.








ABSTRACT
Protein&#8208;templated metal nanoclusters (MNCs) offer a unique strategy for integrating the structural precision of biological scaffolds with the quantum electronic characteristics of atomically precise metallic cores. Despite this promise, the fundamental principles governing charge transport in such biohybrid systems remain limited. Here, we report a systematic investigation of electron transport in Au/BSA&#8208;MNCs/Au Nanowire junctions incorporating a series of bovine serum albumin (BSA)&#8208;templated metal nanoclusters of copper, silver, and gold (CuNC, AgNC, and AuNC). Incorporation of MNCs yields up to a 17&#8208;fold increase in current relative to native BSA junctions. The conductivity follows the trend AuNC &gt; AgNC &gt; CuNC, a disparity that fragment&#8208;level Density Functional Theory (DFT) analysis attributes to the greater structural robustness and enhanced orbital delocalization of AuNC and AgNC, which together facilitate stronger electronic coupling with proximal protein residues. Temperature&#8208;dependent charge transport measurements (I&#8208;V&#8208;T) further reveal a systematic evolution from tunneling&#8208;dominated to increasingly band&#8208;like transport across the BSA&#8208;MNC series, governed by the extent of electronic delocalization imparted by the metal core. Collectively, these findings provide molecular&#8208;level insight into charge transport in protein&#8208;templated MNCs and establish structure&#8208;property design principles for the next&#8208;generation bioelectronic materials.

         <title>Adhesive Photoinitiator Constructs Polymer Jackets on Enzymes: Direct, Release&#8208;Free Cytosolic Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular adhesive photoinitiator, GuCD&#8835;BP&#8208;SH, overcomes a central dilemma in enzyme therapeutics. The initiator, featuring a guanidinium&#8208;modified cyclodextrin (GuCD) host, triggers formation of a semi&#8208;permeable polymer jacket directly on an enzyme. This jacket uniquely provides proteolytic resistance and enables direct cytosolic delivery, all while preserving significant catalytic function, thus unifying protection and substrate access.








ABSTRACT
Enzyme therapeutics require both catalytic activity and efficient cytosolic delivery&#8212;yet protective encapsulation typically compromises enzymatic function, while achieving cellular uptake without lysosomal degradation remains challenging. We address this with a rationally designed supramolecular adhesive photoinitiator (GuCD&#8835;BP&#8208;SH) that unifies surface adhesion, radical initiation, and membrane translocation within a single host&#8208;guest architecture. Guanidinium (Gu+) motifs on a cyclodextrin scaffold (GuCD) enable non&#8208;covalent adhesion to protein surfaces at carboxylate&#8208;rich regions; the cyclodextrin cavity hosts a thiol&#8208;benzophenone guest (BP&#8208;SH) whose photoactivation (365&#160;nm, 60&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 for 30&#160;min) initiates localized grafting&#8208;from polymerization, constructing a semi&#8208;permeable polymer jacket. Applied to &#946;&#8208;galactosidase, this yields sub&#8208;100&#160;nm multi&#8208;enzyme nanoassemblies (containing &#8764;10 enzymes per particle) retaining &#8764;30% catalytic activity with exceptional proteolytic resistance: 86% activity retained versus 25% for unprotected enzyme after Proteinase K challenge. The incorporated Gu+ motifs enable efficient, energy&#8208;independent cytosolic delivery via membrane translocation, with 91% of cells showing catalytic activity compared to 5% with non&#8208;jacketed enzyme. This modular strategy confers protection and cell&#8208;penetrating capability onto native biomacromolecules while maintaining catalytic function, eliminating the need for enzyme release&#8212;a persistent bottleneck in therapeutic delivery.

         <title>Distinct Tunable In&#8208;Plane Birefringence via Domain Manipulation in a 2D Metal Halide Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a distinct tunable in&#8208;plane birefringence via domain manipulation in a 2D metal halide ferroelectric, which will advance the development of ferroelectric&#8208;based photonic devices for data storage and integrated optoelectronics.








ABSTRACT
Single crystals with tunable birefringence hold an exciting position in optical and photonic devices due to their exceptional ability of light manipulation. Although ferroelectric domains have been utilized to regulate physical properties, studies on tuning their birefringence by virtue of domain structure remain largely scarce. Herein, we have demonstrated the modulation of in&#8208;plane birefringence through manipulating domain structures in a 2D metal halide ferroelectric, (2&#8208;MBA)2PbCl4 (1, 2&#8208;MBA&#160;=&#160;2&#8208;methylbutylamine), which exhibits a phase transition at 314&#160;K with spontaneous polarization of 1.6&#160;&#181;C/cm2. Crystal 1 exhibits controllable birefringence that can be modified by thermal and optical stimuli; this behavior directly involves with its ferroelectric properties. Notably, we have achieved unusual in&#8208;plane birefringence tuning via domain structure, which is further modulated by coupling domain manipulation with heat, light, and mechanical pressure. This work provides a new strategy for controlling birefringence, and advances the development of ferroelectric&#8208;based photonic devices for data storage and integrated optoelectronics.

         <title>Dual Chemical Looping/Catalytic Process for Alkylation of Benzene With Ethane and Propane Yielding Ethylbenzene and Cumene Over Copper&#8208;Containing Mordenite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a dual chemical looping/catalytic process coupling alkane dehydrogenation with aromatic alkylation over Cu&#8208;mordenite, yielding up to 25% alkylated aromatics with &gt;95% selectivity per cycle. In situ NMR, FTIR spectroscopy, and DFT show alkylation proceeds via a &#960;&#8208;bound Cu(I)&#8211;olefin intermediate and Br&#248;nsted acid sites. DFT reveals a low&#8208;barrier bifunctional pathway versus prohibitively high barriers for direct Cu(I)&#8208;mediated mechanism.








ABSTRACT
Given the sustained demand for alkylated aromatics and the strained olefin market, there is an urgent need to develop efficient one&#8208;step processes for the direct alkylation of aromatics using alkanes instead of olefins. Such technologies offer greater energy efficiency and sustainability by eliminating the need for separate, energy&#8208;intensive alkane dehydrogenation steps. In this work, we report a dual chemical looping / catalytic process that couples alkane dehydrogenation with aromatic alkylation over a copper&#8208;containing mordenite yielding up to 25% of alkylated aromatics with &gt;97% selectivity per cycle. In situ MAS NMR and FTIR spectroscopies combined with DFT calculations showed that the alkylation of benzene with alkanes proceeds via a &#960;&#8208;bounded Cu(I)&#8208;olefin intermediate, which subsequently interacts with benzene, catalyzed by Br&#248;nsted acid sites, leading to alkylated products that readily desorb from the active material into the gas phase. DFT calculations show that alkylation mediated solely by Cu(I) has prohibitively high barriers (&gt;1.8&#160;eV), whereas a bi&#8208;functional pathway involving both Cu(I) and Br&#248;nsted acid sites can proceed with significantly lower barrier (0.8&#160;eV) through a concerted C&#8211;C bond formation and proton transfer step.

         <title>From Phenols to Proteins: One&#8208;Pot Biosynthesis and Genetic Encoding of Chalcogen&#8208;Containing Tyrosine Analogues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot enzymatic platform enables the biosynthesis and site&#8208;specific incorporation of chalcogen&#8208;containing tyrosine analogues (O, S, Se) into proteins in E. coli. Engineered tyrosine phenol lyase (TPL) variants and orthogonal synthetases are combined to expand the genetic code with redox&#8208;active residues, paving the way for designer proteins with tunable electronic and catalytic properties.








ABSTRACT
Expanding the genetic code with unnatural amino acids (UAAs) offers powerful opportunities to engineer proteins with novel redox and catalytic functions, but is often limited by the need for multistep UAA synthesis and inefficient cellular uptake. Here, we report an integrated biosynthetic&#8211;genetic incorporation strategy for chalcogen&#8208;containing proteins from the respective phenols. Structure&#8208;guided engineering of tyrosine phenol lyase (TPL) enabled the enzymatic production of 3&#8208;methoxy&#8208;, 3&#8208;methylthio&#8208;, and 3&#8208;methylseleno&#8208;L&#8208;tyrosine (MeSeY) directly in living cells. Using evolved orthogonal aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases, these analogues were site&#8208;specifically incorporated into green fluorescent protein (GFP), as confirmed by fluorescence assays, spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. We further established a one&#8208;pot in vivo system that unifies analogue biosynthesis with translation, reducing precursor requirements and cellular toxicity. This work introduces selenium as a genetically encoded handle for protein engineering and establishes a scalable strategy that couples biocatalysis with genetic code expansion to access redox&#8208;active designer proteins. Importantly, installation of MeSeY at the GFP chromophore residue Tyr66 provides redox&#8208;responsive fluorescence. In a circularly permuted GFP (cpGFP) scaffold, improved chromophore accessibility enables reversible redox switching under H2O2/thiol cycling.

         <title>Local Polarity Engineering via Unsaturated Cu&#8211;N3 Sites for Enhanced Iodine Redox Chemistry in Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We engineer unsaturated Cu&#8211;N3 sites to create local polarized microenvironments on the carbon host matrix, which accelerates iodine redox reaction and suppresses polyiodides shuttling. This work provides a general strategy for rational design of aqueous battery electrodes, bridging atomic&#8208;scale chemistry with macroscopic electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Rational engineering of the local microenvironment in catalytic host materials is pivotal for high&#8208;performance zinc&#8208;iodine batteries, as it governs iodine species adsorption, accelerates redox kinetics, and suppresses polyiodides shuttling. Herein, we propose a local polarity engineering strategy by incorporating unsaturated Cu&#8211;N3 sites into carbon matrix to construct polarized microenvironments and promote iodine redox chemistry. Combined theoretical and experimental analyses reveal that the unsaturated coordination of Cu atoms induces intrinsic local polarity, which enhances charge redistribution, lowers the activation barrier of the I2/I&#8722; redox reaction, and strengthens electronic coupling with polyiodide intermediates. In situ UV&#8211;vis and Raman spectroscopies corroborate that the Cu&#8211;N3 sites effectively immobilize polyiodides, thus mitigating the shuttle effect. As cathode host, the Cu&#8211;N3 sites&#8208;rich carbon electrode achieves high discharge capacity of 232.2 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1 and exceptional long&#8208;term stability with 94.02% capacity retention after 50,000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1. More importantly, benefiting from its superior catalytic activity toward iodine redox reaction, the Cu&#8211;N3 sites&#8208;rich carbon enables solar cells to achieve a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 9.14%. This work elucidates a novel design principle for regulating local polarity to propel iodine electrochemistry, offering new insights into the development of advanced iodine&#8208;based energy devices.

         <title>Phosphorus&#8208;Induced Charge Redistribution and Lattice Self&#8208;Regulation in Cu3PSe4 Enables Low N/P Ratio and Durable Zn&#8211;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique charge and lattice self&#8208;regulation mechanism is unveiled in Cu3PSe4 that drives expedited Zn2+ transport and high&#8208;capacity performance. This mechanism originates from phosphorus&#8208;induced charge and structural reconfiguration of in situ&#8208;formed Cu2Se, triggering a transition from lattice contraction to expansion and thereby enhances capacity and Zn2+ transport kinetics.








ABSTRACT
Zn&#8211;I2 batteries is a promising large&#8208;scale energy storage technology, yet conventional Zn metal anode faces challenges including corrosion, dendrite growth, and side reactions, hindering its practical application. Zn2+ host anodes, leveraging the rocking&#8208;chair mechanism and inherent polyiodide inertness, offer a potential solution to these issues. However, existing host anodes suffer from sluggish Zn2+ kinetics and low capacity, limiting their compatibility with cathodes. Herein, we report a unique charge and lattice self&#8208;regulation mechanism in Cu3PSe4 that drives expedited Zn2+ transport and high&#8208;capacity performance. In this configuration, Cu3PSe4 in situ decomposes to P and Cu2Se during initial cycling and Cu2Se provide subsequent capacity. Importantly, phosphorus modulates the Cu2Se lattice, inducing a transition from conventional contraction to expansion during Zn2+ insertion, thereby enhancing ion transport kinetics and capacity simultaneously. Theoretical calculations reveal that P reconfigures the charge distribution and spatial configuration in Cu2Se, reducing Zn2+ diffusion barrier. Consequently, the optimized Cu3PSe4 anode delivers 150.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20 A g&#8722;1, and the assembled Cu3PSe4||I2 cell achieves an exceptional lifespan of 30,000 cycles at 9&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 with a low N/P ratio of 1.1, demonstrating superior stability. This work provides a novel system of corrosion&#8208;resistant anode for high&#8208;performance and metal&#8208;zinc&#8208;free zinc&#8211;iodine batteries.

         <title>Biocatalytic Regioselective C&#8208;Formylation of Resorcinol Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acyltransferase from Chromobacterium sphagni (CsATase) was identified that catalyzes the regioselective formylation of resorcinol substrates. The formylation of substituted resorcinol derivatives yielded mono&#8208;formylated products with up to 99% conversion and up to 74% isolated yield. The structure of CsATase was elucidated by X&#8208;ray crystallography, providing insight into its active site.








ABSTRACT
Although aromatic formylation reactions are highly valuable from a synthetic perspective, a biocatalytic version has not yet been reported. Here, the cofactor&#8208;independent multimeric three&#8208;component acyltransferase from Chromobacterium sphagni (CsATase) was identified to enable the nonnatural promiscuous regioselective C&#8208;formylation of polyphenolic substrates, especially resorcinol derivatives, and thus extending the reaction scope of acyltransferases. Formylation of 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;substituted resorcinol derivatives gave access to regioselectively mono&#8208;formylated products with up to 99% conversion and up to 74% isolated yield. Formylation of phloroglucinol led to the di&#8208;formylated product with 99% conversion, outperforming chemical methods. Structural analysis of CsATase by X&#8208;ray crystallography provided insights into its active site.

         <title>DNA Flap&#8208;Mediated Control of Transcription for Programmable RNA Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrimidine&#8208;rich ssDNA flaps on the T7 promoter inhibit T7 RNA polymerase (T7RP) transcription. Leveraging this pyrimidine bias, we developed DNAzyme&#8208; and MNAzyme&#8208;mediated flap promoter induced transcription control (D&#8208;FIT and M&#8208;FIT) systems. These platforms enable regulated transcription and sequence&#8208;specific detection, highlighting the programmable potential of T7RP pyrimidine bias. 








ABSTRACT
The growing success of RNA&#8208;based therapeutics has emphasized the need for precise and programmable RNA synthesis platforms. T7 RNA polymerase (T7RP) is widely utilized for in vitro transcription; however, most existing regulatory strategies rely on auxiliary proteins or chemical modulators. Here, we investigated whether transcription can be regulated solely through nucleic acid sequences. Specifically, we evaluated the effects of single&#8208;stranded DNA flap sequences appended to the 3&#8242; end of the non&#8208;template strand of the T7 promoter, termed the flap promoter, on transcriptional efficiency. Remarkably, we observed a sequence&#8208;dependent inhibitory effect, wherein flaps enriched in pyrimidines (cytosine and thymine) significantly suppressed T7RP&#8208;mediated transcription. Leveraging this intrinsic sequence preference, we developed two novel transcription control platforms, D&#8208;FIT (DNAzyme&#8208;mediated Flap promoter Induced Transcription control) and M&#8208;FIT (MNAzyme&#8208;mediated Flap promoter Induced Transcription control) that enable precise regulation of T7RP activity without the need for auxiliary proteins or chemical agents. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized sequence&#8208;specific regulatory mechanism of T7RP and establish a new framework for the rational design of programmable RNA synthesis systems, with broad potential applications in RNA therapeutics and diagnostics.

         <title>Molecular Electrocatalyst Enables Direct Electrochemical Capture and Conversion of CO2 up to Atmospheric Concentration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular manganese electrocatalyst enables the direct electrochemical capture and conversion of dilute CO2 (1% &#8211; 0.2%) to CO with nearly unit Faradaic efficiency, achieving high efficiency even at atmospheric concentrations (420&#160;ppm). By bypassing energy&#8208;intensive pre&#8208;concentration steps, this integrated approach highlights a sustainable pathway for valorizing dilute CO2 streams directly into chemical fuels.








ABSTRACT
The conversion of low&#8208;concentration CO2 streams into fuel is highly desirable for industrial applications, avoiding energy&#8208;intensive CO2 capture and concentration. Here, we report a highly active molecular electrocatalyst, fac&#8208;[Mn(CO)3(bis&#8208;MeNHC)(MeCN)]+ (1&#8208;MeCN+), which enables the direct electrochemical reduction of near&#8208;atmospheric CO2 concentrations to CO with up to 100% Faradaic efficiency. Voltammetric analysis at varying CO2 concentrations reveals a clear transition between distinct kinetic regimes, shifting from pure kinetic control to a regime dominated by CO2 depletion. Kinetic analysis in the 5%&#8211;100% CO2 range reveals a first&#8208;order dependence on substrate concentration. Infrared spectroelectrochemistry confirms that the electrogenerated anionic catalyst remains active under extremely diluted CO2 conditions. Computational modeling further supports that the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion mediated by the doubly reduced species is kinetically accessible at atmospheric CO2 levels.

     alt="Molecular Electrocatalyst Enables Direct Electrochemical Capture and Conversion of CO2 up to Atmospheric Concentration"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A molecular manganese electrocatalyst enables the direct electrochemical capture and conversion of dilute CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (1% &#8211; 0.2%) to CO with nearly unit Faradaic efficiency, achieving high efficiency even at atmospheric concentrations (420&#160;ppm). By bypassing energy-intensive pre-concentration steps, this integrated approach highlights a sustainable pathway for valorizing dilute CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; streams directly into chemical fuels.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversion of low-concentration CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; streams into fuel is highly desirable for industrial applications, avoiding energy-intensive CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture and concentration. Here, we report a highly active molecular electrocatalyst, &lt;i&gt;fac&lt;/i&gt;-[Mn(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(bis-MeNHC)(MeCN)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1-MeCN&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;), which enables the direct electrochemical reduction of near-atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations to CO with up to 100% Faradaic efficiency. Voltammetric analysis at varying CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations reveals a clear transition between distinct kinetic regimes, shifting from pure kinetic control to a regime dominated by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; depletion. Kinetic analysis in the 5%&#8211;100% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; range reveals a first-order dependence on substrate concentration. Infrared spectroelectrochemistry confirms that the electrogenerated anionic catalyst remains active under extremely diluted CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conditions. Computational modeling further supports that the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-CO conversion mediated by the doubly reduced species is kinetically accessible at atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels. This work demonstrates molecular electrocatalysis even at CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations as low as 420&#160;ppm (i.e. atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; partial pressure).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Targeting the Membrane&#8208;Embedded Rhomboid Protease GlpG: A Multimodal Strategy for Inhibitor Discovery and Mechanistic Insight</title>

Rhomboid proteases are a mechanistically unique and evolutionarily conserved protein family. Despite their pharmacological relevance, the development of selective inhibitors has lagged behind that of soluble proteases. Using a high&#8208;throughput screen, novel chemotypes with selective inhibitory activity were identified. Biochemical assays, solid&#8208;state NMR, and molecular docking were used to define inhibitor binding sites and modes.








ABSTRACT
Rhomboid proteases, a class of intramembrane proteases characterized by a Ser&#8208;His catalytic dyad, have recently emerged as promising therapeutic targets. While inhibitors for soluble serine proteases have been extensively studied, the spectrum of potent rhomboid protease inhibitor chemotypes is limited to active&#8208;site targeted nucleophiles. To address this limitation, we conducted a high&#8208;throughput screen of over 68,000 compounds targeting the E. coli rhomboid protease GlpG, using a fluorescent liposome&#8208;based assay. A selection of 326 inhibitory compounds was evaluated in a subsequent IC50 screen against two variants of GlpG (core domain and full length), a soluble serine protease (chymotrypsin), as well as the human mitochondrial rhomboid PARL. Of these, the selective inhibitory effects of 2 compounds and their analogues on GlpG were confirmed through further biochemical and biophysical characterisation, molecular docking, and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. This study paves the way for developing small&#8208;molecule tool compounds and drug&#8208;like molecules targeting rhomboid proteases.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Activated Artificial Channels for pH&#8208;Selective Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of proton&#8208;activated artificial ion channels was developed by integrating self&#8208;assembled peptide chains into a pH&#8208;responsive 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine scaffold. Protonation induces a conformational switch in the channel&#8208;forming units, promoting one&#8208;dimensional self&#8208;assembly and subsequent hydrophobic packing into functional channels that selectively kill cancer cells while sparing normal cells.








ABSTRACT
Proton&#8208;activated ion channels mediate ion transport in response to extracellular acidification, enabling cellular adaptation to acidic microenvironments. Despite their biological importance, mimicking proton&#8208;activated functionality in artificial ion channels remains a significant challenge. Here, we present a novel class of proton&#8208;activated artificial ion channels built from self&#8208;assembled peptide chains integrated into a pH&#8208;responsive 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine scaffold. Protonation induces a conformational switch in the channel&#8208;forming units, promoting one&#8208;dimensional self&#8208;assembly and subsequent hydrophobic packing into functional channels capable of transporting small molecules. As extracellular pH decreases from 7.4 to 6.5, C&#8208;FF exhibits a 10.3&#8208;fold enhancement in cytotoxicity against human colorectal carcinoma cells, boosting an IC50 of 2.8&#160;&#181;M, mediated through apoptosis induction and cell cycle arrest resulting from disruption of the autophagic process. Significantly, C&#8208;FF demonstrates exceptional selectivity for cancer cells, achieving a selectivity index of 8.5, surpassing that of doxorubicin by one order of magnitude while maintaining comparable potency, highlighting its potential as a pH&#8208;responsive platform for selective anticancer therapy in acidic tumor microenvironments.

         <title>Modulation of Local Hydrogen Bonding for Highly Efficient Bi&#8208;MOFs Photocatalyzed Fixation of N2 in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;induced modulation of the local microenvironment on the surface of Bi&#8208;MOF enhances H+ supply capacity and the LMCT effect, thereby facilitating PCET process. The cation hydration effect disrupts HB networks to construct N2 transport channels. These strategies synergistically achieve a dynamic balance among N2 adsorption and activation, proton supply capacity and proton transfer, thus promoting the pNRR process.








ABSTRACT
For photocatalytic reduction of dinitrogen in aqueous solution, water plays an important role as not only a reactant to supply protons via the water oxidation reaction, but also a solvent, which cannot be neglected. At the interface between the catalyst surface and local water molecules, modulation of the hydrogen bonds (HBs) is critical for improving the production rate of ammonia. Herein, both roles (i.e., reactant and solvent) were balanced through the formation of an interfacial HB network between organic ligands of Bi&#8208;MOFs and water with the aim of accelerating water oxidation to produce more protons and facilitating the adsorption of N2 as well as the release of free water molecules. With this approach, the ammonia synthesis rate reached 258.86 &#181;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 at ambient conditions. As demonstrated, the empty 6p orbitals present in Bi3+(6s26p0), can accept electrons from the ligands due to the ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) effect. These electrons are then transferred to the &#960;* antibonding orbitals of N2, thus significantly weakening the N&#8801;N bond. The photogenerated holes on the ligands oxidize hydrogen&#8208;bonded water molecules, producing more protons, which can further promote the critical process, namely the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET), for the multi&#8208;step hydrogenation of N2. Therefore, the dynamic balance among N2 adsorption and activation, proton supply capacity, and proton transfer was achieved through a local microenvironment modulation strategy on MOFs. As a further proof, a phototactically produced NH4+ solution with a concentration of approx. 200 mg&#183;L&#8722;1 was concentrated and used as a fertilizer. Overall, this work provided a new design strategy for the photocatalytic reduction of N2 to produce ammonia on MOFs by elucidating the key role of the HB network.

         <title>Simultaneous Boost of SF6 Adsorption Capacity and Kinetics Through Isoreticular Functionalization of Zinc(II)&#8208;Pyrazolate Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isoreticular functionalization of a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) with a pyridine unit unlocks record&#8208;setting dynamic sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) capture. This strategy enables BUT&#8208;125 (BUT: Beijing University of Technology) to combine a high&#8208;equilibrium capacity with exceptionally fast adsorption kinetics.








ABSTRACT
The capture of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), the most potent greenhouse gas, is of critical importance. Enhancement of dynamic SF6 capture capacity presents significant challenges due to its chemical inertness and low concentration in industrial effluent streams. Herein, we demonstrate that the isoreticular functionalization of zinc&#8208;pyrazolate metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) enables simultaneous enhancement of both SF6 adsorption capacity and uptake kinetics. Through replacement of benzene with pyridine in the ligand, BUT&#8208;125 (BUT: Beijing University of Technology) achieves a record&#8208;high SF6 adsorption capacity of 3.57&#160;mmol cm&#8722;3 at 0.1&#160;bar and 298 K, representing a 27% improvement over its structural analogue Zn&#8208;DPB (DPB: 1,3&#8208;di(pyrazolate&#8208;4&#8208;yl)benzene). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that pyridine functionalization increases the positive charge density on hydrogen atoms within molecular trap sites, strengthening C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;F interactions with SF6 molecules. Remarkably, BUT&#8208;125 also exhibits outstanding adsorption kinetics, that combined with high equilibrium uptake, leads to an exceptional dynamic SF6 capture capacity of 3.42&#160;mmol cm&#8722;3 from the SF6/N2 (10/90) mixture, surpassing reported porous sorbents.

&lt;p&gt;Isoreticular functionalization of a metal-organic framework (MOF) with a pyridine unit unlocks record-setting dynamic sulfur hexafluoride (SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) capture. This strategy enables BUT-125 (BUT: Beijing University of Technology) to combine a high-equilibrium capacity with exceptionally fast adsorption kinetics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The capture of sulfur hexafluoride (SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), the most potent greenhouse gas, is of critical importance. Enhancement of dynamic SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; capture capacity presents significant challenges due to its chemical inertness and low concentration in industrial effluent streams. Herein, we demonstrate that the isoreticular functionalization of zinc-pyrazolate metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) enables simultaneous enhancement of both SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption capacity and uptake kinetics. Through replacement of benzene with pyridine in the ligand, BUT-125 (BUT: Beijing University of Technology) achieves a record-high SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption capacity of 3.57&#160;mmol cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1&#160;bar and 298 K, representing a 27% improvement over its structural analogue Zn-DPB (DPB: 1,3-di(pyrazolate-4-yl)benzene). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that pyridine functionalization increases the positive charge density on hydrogen atoms within molecular trap sites, strengthening C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;F interactions with SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; molecules.

         <title>Inert Complexes Unlock Ligand&#8208;Accelerated Transition&#8208;Metal Catalysis on Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand&#8208;accelerated transition&#8208;metal catalysis on proteins is achieved by stabilizing metal&#8211;ligand complexes against competitive coordination on protein surfaces. Guided by coordination&#8208;strength screening, Ni&#8208;BCS and Cu&#8208;BCS remain active in biological environments, enabling depropargylation and CuAAC directly on proteins with substoichiometric catalyst loadings. This work establishes truly catalytic transition&#8208;metal chemistry in living systems.








ABSTRACT
Reactions that excel in small&#8208;molecule settings typically require metal loadings far exceeding the number of protein reaction sites (often &#8805;10&#8208;fold) once transplanted into proteinaceous media&#8212;conditions that are not truly &#8220;catalytic.&#8221; Here, we show that biologically inert metal&#8211;ligand complexes based on bathocuproine disulfonic acid disodium salt (BCS) overcome this barrier and enable ligand&#8208;accelerated catalysis (LAC) on proteins under substoichiometric conditions. For example, Ni&#8208;BCS effects complete deprotection of green fluorescent protein bearing N&#949;&#8208;propargyloxycarbonyl&#8208;L&#8208;lysine (GFP&#8208;ProcLys) at 5 mol% catalyst with an observed turnover number (TON) &#8776; 20, surpassing all previously reported metal&#8208;catalyzed depropargylation reactions. Mechanistic studies indicate that an in situ Ni&#8211;H intermediate mediates multiple transformations on proteins, including reductive deuteration of terminal alkenes/alkynes and efficient decaging across diverse amino acid side chains. Likewise, Cu&#8208;BCS enables copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) on proteins at 10 mol% with low residual copper and no protein oxidation, in sharp contrast to the benchmark Cu&#8208;BTTAA (tris((1&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1H&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)methyl)amine) system. These outcomes stem from a screening strategy that prioritized metal&#8211;ligand stability, eliminating metal complexes susceptible to protein sequestration and selecting strongly coordinating, physiologically inert pairs. The resulting rational ligand&#8208;design framework for protein&#8208;level transition&#8208;metal catalysis expands the frontier of protein chemistry and paves the way to translate advanced small&#8208;molecule LAC strategies onto protein substrates for posttranslational mutagenesis.

         <title>Dynamic Iodide Regeneration Enabled by Piperazine&#8208;Tailored PCBM Interfaces for Photothermally Stable and Efficient Inverted Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new class of PA&#8208;tailored fullerene derivative, PCBM&#8208;PA, that uniquely exhibits dual functionality in iodine capture and dissociation, markedly enhancing perovskite stability and mitigating silver electrode corrosion. Incorporation of PCBM&#8208;PA into inverted PSCs leads to significant improvement of both device efficiency and operational durability, delivering a champion efficiency of 26.26% and&#160;&gt;&#160;T93 lifetime under MPPT at 65 &#176;C for 1000&#160;h.








Abstract
Molecular iodine release under working conditions remains a major obstacle to the long&#8208;term stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Despite significant progress, developing a simple yet effective strategy to suppress this degradation pathway&#8212;while reconciling high photothermal stability and high efficiency without sacrificing charge transport&#8212;remains challenging. Here, through integrated molecular design, theoretical modeling, and experimental validation, we develop a new class of piperazine (PA)&#8208;tailored fullerene derivative, PCBM&#8208;PA, that uniquely exhibits dual functionality in iodine capture and dissociation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that PCBM&#8208;PA promotes I2 adsorption and I&#9472;I bond cleavage at the perovskite surface, facilitating dynamic iodide regeneration. Comprehensive experiments further confirm that PCBM&#8208;PA effectively suppresses I2 release through robust N&#183;&#183;&#183;I halogen&#8208;bonding (XB) interactions, while simultaneously promoting I&#9472;I bond cleavage and restoration of iodide ions, consistent with theoretical insights. This coupled &#8220;iodine adsorption&#8211;dissociation&#8221; behavior, unprecedented among previously reported XB acceptors, enables dynamic self&#8208;repair of iodine vacancy defects. Consequently, inverted PSCs incorporating PCBM&#8208;PA exhibit outstanding photothermal stability, retaining over 93% of their initial efficiency after 1000&#160;h under maximum power point tracking (MPPT) at 65 &#176;C, together with a champion efficiency of 26.26%. This work offers a new molecular&#8208;engineering pathway toward iodine&#8208;resilient, high&#8208;performance perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Highly Efficient Deep&#8208;Blue Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence With Tunable Long&#8208;Lived Afterglow and Reversible Photoactivation Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of succinimide units into the triphenylamine skeleton enables n&#8208;&#960;* transition as a source of phosphorescence. In this way, three wide&#8208;band&#8208;gap emitters, MSPA, BSPA, and TSPA, exhibiting deep&#8208;blue room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) with reversible photoactivation properties were constructed. MSPA&#8208;doped PVA film exhibits excellent RTP at 440&#160;nm with ultralong lifetime of 1403&#160;ms and phosphorescence yield as high as 14.32%








ABSTRACT
Wide band gap organic molecule with ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) remains a big challenge in optoelectronic field due to the intrinsic large Stokes shift of phosphorescence relative to fluorescence, and complexity of filling and stabilizing high&#8208;energy triplet excited states. In this work, three organic small molecules, MSPA, BSPA, and TSPA, based on succinimide and triphenylamine groups are designed and synthesized, and deep&#8208;blue RTP with reversible photoactivation properties is successfully realized by physically doping them into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix. Notably, MSPA&#8208;doped film exhibits RTP at 440&#160;nm with ultralong lifetime of 1403&#160;ms and phosphorescence quantum yield as high as 14.32%. Theoretical calculations reveal that the efficient intersystem crossing and strong intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions leads to the ultralong RTP in MSPA/PVA doping system. Taking advantages of the wide band gaps, tunable organic afterglow, and reversible photoactivation behaviors of MSPA, BSPA, and TSPA, the amorphous and flexible films are prepared and show potential applications in photoactivated information encryption, advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and multicolored displays through triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet F&#246;rster energy transfer. This work provides a reliable strategy to realize high&#8208;performance wide band gap RTP materials and further broadening practical applications in organic optoelectronic information.

         <title>Covalent Protein Inhibitors via Tyrosine and Tryptophan Conjugation with Cyclic Imine Mannich Electrophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeted covalent inhibitors (TCI) containing cyclic imine warheads react with tyrosine and tryptophan residues via the Mannich reaction. These cyclic imine warheads show comparable reaction kinetics to cysteine&#8208;reactive electrophiles commonly used in TCIs. Tyrosine&#8208;reactive TCIs were developed from an inhibitor of the CBX8 chromodomain and demonstrated increased potency, selective proteome&#8208;wide labeling, and improved cellular activity. This strategy will expand the capabilities of TCIs for targeting both tyrosine and tryptophan. 








Abstract
Targeted covalent inhibitors (TCIs) are increasingly popular as drug candidates and chemical probes. Among current TCIs, the chemistry is largely limited to cysteine and lysine side chain reactivity. Here, we investigated the utility of cyclic imine Mannich electrophiles as covalent warheads to target protein tyrosine and tryptophan side chains. We characterized the intrinsic reaction rates of several cyclic imines to tyrosine and other amino acid side chains and validated reactivity using protein affinity labeling of a cyclic imine&#8208;modified trimethoprim with tyrosine and tryptophan mutants of E. coli dihydrofolate reductase. To validate the utility of the approach, we appended cyclic imine warheads to a CBX8 chromodomain inhibitor to label a non&#8208;conserved tyrosine, which improved both the potency and selectivity of the inhibitor for CBX8 in vitro and in cells. These findings indicate that Mannich electrophiles are promising and robust chemical warheads for tyrosine and tryptophan bioconjugation and development of covalent inhibitors.

     alt="Covalent Protein Inhibitors via Tyrosine and Tryptophan Conjugation with Cyclic Imine Mannich Electrophiles"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeted covalent inhibitors (TCI) containing cyclic imine warheads react with tyrosine and tryptophan residues via the Mannich reaction. These cyclic imine warheads show comparable reaction kinetics to cysteine-reactive electrophiles commonly used in TCIs. Tyrosine-reactive TCIs were developed from an inhibitor of the CBX8 chromodomain and demonstrated increased potency, selective proteome-wide labeling, and improved cellular activity. This strategy will expand the capabilities of TCIs for targeting both tyrosine and tryptophan. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeted covalent inhibitors (TCIs) are increasingly popular as drug candidates and chemical probes. Among current TCIs, the chemistry is largely limited to cysteine and lysine side chain reactivity. Here, we investigated the utility of cyclic imine Mannich electrophiles as covalent warheads to target protein tyrosine and tryptophan side chains. We characterized the intrinsic reaction rates of several cyclic imines to tyrosine and other amino acid side chains and validated reactivity using protein affinity labeling of a cyclic imine-modified trimethoprim with tyrosine and tryptophan mutants of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; dihydrofolate reductase. To validate the utility of the approach, we appended cyclic imine warheads to a CBX8 chromodomain inhibitor to label a non-conserved tyrosine, which improved both the potency and selectivity of the inhibitor for CBX8 in vitro and in cells. These findings indicate that Mannich electrophiles are promising and robust chemical warheads for tyrosine and tryptophan bioconjugation and development of covalent inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rapid RASER MRI</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid RASER MRI allows for image acquisition without RF excitation. Instead, a population inversion on the nuclear spins is generated by SABRE hyperpolarization, which allows for self&#8208;excitation through the RASER approach. When the desired transverse magnetization is built&#8208;up, conventional EPI encoding is triggered to record the image.








Abstract
Conventional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) relies on high&#8208;power Radio&#8208;Frequency (RF) pulses to excite nuclear spins and in turn generate NMR signals. These pulses require large high&#8208;power RF&#8208;amplifiers and cause heat deposition in the tissue, which must be minimized for safety, presenting a growing problem when moving toward ever&#8208;higher field MRI. An alternative to RF&#8208;pulse excitation is self&#8208;excitation of nuclear spins using Radiofrequency Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation (RASER), where the nuclear spins undergo spontaneous transition, without RF excitation, from an over&#8208;populated state to a ground state. Here, the feasibility of recording rapid proton RASER MRI images of pyrazine at low concentration (120&#160;mM) with large matrix (128x128 pixels) in as little as 78&#160;ms is demonstrated at 500&#160;MHz (11.7&#160;T). We also recorded a time&#8208;series of images using a single bolus hyperpolarized pyrazine highlighting the feasibility of dynamic tracking. The demonstrated approach allows recording MRI scans without transmit&#8208;receive electronics of the MRI scanner, which is highly desirable for portable MRI as well as the emerging field of hyperpolarized MRI using, e.g., HP protons, 129Xe gas or HP 13C labeled biomolecules as molecular tracers and imaging agents.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Complex Orchestrating Pyroptosis for Hypoxia&#8208;Tolerant Photoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Zn2+&#8208;complex was developed for orchestrating hypoxia&#8208;tolerant photoimmunotherapy. Zn2+ coordination significantly lower the &#916;ES1&#8722;T1, leading to exceptionally high ROS generation efficiency through Type I mechanisms to overcome hypoxic microenvironment. It can photodynamically damage lysosomes to trigger pyroptosis, which further activate anti&#8208;tumor immune responses to curbe the proliferation of 4T1 tumors in vivo.








ABSTRACT
Photon&#8208;driven pyroptosis represents an advanced and promising modality in anti&#8208;tumor immunotherapy, offering new avenue in combating cancer recurrence and metastasis. Essential metal&#8208;complex shows great potential in photoimmunotherapy, which however hardly generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) to active photoimmunotherapy under light irradiation due to low spin&#8211;orbit coupling (SOC) resulting in intersystem crossing (ISC) being blocked. To address this challenge, we innovatively proposed the concept of essential&#8208;metal ion as an electron&#8208;withdrawing group to modulate the donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) system, thereby significantly improving ROS generation efficiency. As a proof of concept, we designed and synthesized a series of Zn2+&#8208;complexes through constructing enhanced D&#8208;A systems. Zn2+ coordination efficiently enhances the ISC by lowering the excited singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;ES1&#8722;T1), leading to exceptionally high ROS generation efficiency through Type I mechanisms to overcome hypoxia and the immunosuppression of tumor microenvironment. In these Zn2+&#8208;complexes, Zn&#8208;TPY&#8208;TPA&#8208;DTZ can photodynamically damage lysosomes to trigger pyroptosis, which further induce anti&#8208;tumor immune responses through the promotion of immunogenic cell death (ICD), and ultimately generates a robust anti&#8208;tumor immune response and curbed the proliferation of 4T1 tumors in vivo. This study provides systematic guidance for the rational design of advanced Zn2+&#8208;complexes, propelling advancements in cancer treatment strategies.

         <title>PCA&#8208;Based Database Mining Enables the Discovery of Bacterial Carbene Transferases for Stereodivergent Cyclopropanation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Database mining using principal component analysis (PCA)&#8208;based clustering enabled discovery of bacterial enzymes capable of catalyzing stereodivergent cyclopropanation of styrene. Statistical analyses of sequence data further revealed characteristic structural properties of these enzymes, highlighting the potential of the bioinformatics tools for exploring enzyme candidates for abiotic reactions beyond the scope of natural biological function. 








ABSTRACT
Protein engineering is a practical approach to providing enzymes with an &#8220;abiotic&#8221; catalytic activity. However, it remains difficult to explore the full diversity of natural sequence space through the engineering of a single specific protein. As an alternative to these protein engineering approaches, we here demonstrate a database mining approach using a principal component analysis (PCA)&#8208;based clustering method to facilitate the identification of promising enzyme candidates. As a proof of concept, we applied this method to the cyclopropanation of styrene, and the sequence space of bacterial globins in the database was extensively investigated. By screening 275 globins from 171 different organisms, we successfully discovered enzymes capable of catalyzing stereodivergent carbene transfer reactions. Furthermore, statistical analyses of sequence data allowed us to detect characteristic structural properties of these globins, which determine the unique stereoselectivity of cyclopropanation. While these bioinformatics tools have primarily been applied to predict enzymes&#8217; natural biological functions, this study demonstrates their applicability to exploring enzyme candidates for abiotic reactions unrelated to their native biological activity. Given the increasing interest in biocatalytic applications beyond natural reactivity, this PCA&#8208;based mining approach provides a promising direction for expanding the functional diversity of biocatalysts.

Abstract
Iridium&#8208;catalyzed Conia&#8208;ene reactions of &#945;&#8208;amino amides are described. These units undergo 6&#8208; or 7&#8208;exo cyclization onto amido&#8208;tethered alkenes to provide benzofused N&#8208;heterocycles. In this process, challenging contiguous stereocenters are installed with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. The method provides a versatile platform for constructing sp3&#8208;rich heterocycles, and offers unusual examples of alkenes engaging in enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective Conia&#8208;ene reactions. This study adds to an emerging body of processes that exploit the directed generation of Ir&#8208;enolates.

         <title>Hidden Diradical: Conformational Switch for Solvatochromic NIR Emission With Unity Quantum Yield in Thiele's Hydrocarbon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halogen substitution controls a conformational switch between a folded closed&#8208;shell and a flat singlet&#8208;diradical conformer in an air&#8208;stable Thiele&#8208;diradical. This conformational switch allows for near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield with a large Stokes shift, solvatochromism, and a long&#8208;lived excited state. We delineate how to harness the peculiar photophysical properties of usually air&#8208;sensitive diradicals by air&#8208;stable proxy compounds.








ABSTRACT
We present that halogen&#8208;substituted and air&#8208;stable Thiele&#8208;type diradicaloids with folded (1) and planar (2, 3) structures can be obtained by switching the positions of fluorine and chlorine substituents. The strongly distorted p&#8208;quinodimethane 1 demonstrates emission in the UV&#8211;visible/near&#8208;infrared (UV&#8211;vis/NIR) range with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 100%, an exceedingly large Stokes shift of up to 2.0&#160;eV, an excited state lifetime of 81&#160;ns, and pronounced solvatochromic emission (from 1.81&#160;eV in n&#8208;pentane to approximately 2.0&#160;eV in dichloromethane). Dual emission in pentane, transient absorption spectroscopy, quantum chemical calculations, as well as the comparison with compounds 2 and 3 reveal that the exceptional photophysical properties of closed&#8208;shell 1 are thanks to interconversion with its planar conformer 1flat. The key here is that the conformer 1flat, which is generated upon photoexcitation, excels with a pronounced singlet diradical character (y0 = 0.78) and a dark doubly excited (DE) S1 state. Our findings delineate how to leverage conformational equilibria to design bright luminescent materials based on hidden and thus air&#8208;stable organic diradicals.

         <title>Resolving the Efficiency&#8211;Mechanical Trade&#8208;off in Organic Solar Cells: 20.4% Enabled by Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy combining random copolymerization and hydrogen&#8208;bonding modulation was developed to balance the photovoltaic performance and mechanical robustness of conjugated polymer donors. This approach enabled the fabrication of organic solar cells with a high&#8208;power conversion efficiency of 20.4%, accompanied by robust mechanical properties and superior stability.








ABSTRACT
Organic solar cells (OSCs) face a trade&#8208;off between power conversion efficiency (PCE) and mechanical robustness: high toughness requires low&#8208;crystallinity amorphous polymers, which impair photovoltaic performance. Herein, we propose a strategy combining random copolymerization and hydrogen&#8208;bonding modulation to resolve this conflict. First, the incorporation of an ester&#8208;substituted thiophene yields PM6&#8208;H, exhibiting improved toughness (high crack&#8208;onset strain, COS) but lower PCE. Subsequently, introducing &#9472;OH and &#9472;OOCNHC6H13 groups at the terminals of alkyl chains forms PM6&#8208;OH and PM6&#8208;UR. The hydrogen bonding serves dual functions: acting as dynamic cross&#8208;linking sites to further enhance mechanical properties while restoring optimal lamellar stacking for efficient charge transport. As a result, these copolymers simultaneously achieve a COS exceeding 46%, a high PCE of up to 20.4%, and superior storage, thermal, and light stability (with T80 being twice that of the PM6 benchmark). Flexible OSCs fabricated using these donor polymers deliver a PCE of 18.22% while maintaining outstanding flexibility, with &#8764;90% PCE retention after 2200 bending cycles (vs. 78% for controls). This work demonstrates that copolymerization with controlled hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions overcomes the efficiency&#8208;robustness trade&#8208;off in OSCs through precise structural modulation, paving the way for high&#8208;performance, mechanically durable, and stable OSCs suitable for practical applications.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of a tumor&#8208;specific protein degradation nanoplatform is achieved by splitting PROTACs into click&#8208;reactive ligands and incorporating them into a delivery system responsive to tumor&#8208;overexpressed enzymes legumain and cathepsin B. The two split PROTAC precursors are separately released and undergo in&#8208;cell bioorthogonal clicking to reconstitute functional PROTACs. These findings confer logic&#8208;gated tumor selectivity to PROTAC delivery systems for efficient and precise protein degradation.








ABSTRACT
PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs) represents a promising therapeutic modality with the potential to revolutionize targeted protein degradation. However, challenges such as low bioavailability and off&#8208;target effects significantly limit their clinical efficacy. Herein, we introduce a Split&#8208;Deliver&#8208;Click nanoplatform that enables tumor&#8208;specific protein degradation through &#8220;AND&#8221; logic&#8208;gated, in&#8208;cell bioorthogonal clicking of PROTACs, inspired by the ternary structure of PROTACs and logic&#8208;gated stimulus&#8208;sensitive drug delivery. First, PROTACs were split with click&#8208;reactive ligands, enabling their direct use in cellular assays for efficient PROTAC screening. Next, a delivery system was developed, utilizing an &#8220;AND&#8221; logic gate mechanism triggered by tumor&#8208;overexpressed enzymes legumain and cathepsin B to separately activate and release the split PROTAC precursors. Finally, this approach permitted in&#8208;cell click chemistry to generate PROTAC (Click&#8208;PROTAC), achieving efficient and specific protein degradation. This Split&#8208;Deliver&#8208;Click strategy facilitated the in situ generation of PROTACs for precise protein degradation.

         <dc:description>
An unnoted electronic state was shown to guide water nucleophilic attack, generating a quartet state with five unpaired electrons and placing Co&#8943;O oxygen in a local atomic&#8208;like character. Electrons of water flow into the SOMOs of the atomic&#8208;oxygen&#8208;like center. This electronic structure is a key to understanding O&#8211;O bond formation.








Abstract
O&#8211;O bond formation catalyzed by a water&#8208;oxidizing Co&#8211;O center was studied via state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art multi&#8208;configurational quantum chemical calculations. An unnoted electronic state was shown to guide water nucleophilic attack (WNA). Incoming water perturbs and over&#8208;stretches the Co&#8211;O bond, generating a quartet state with five unpaired electrons, with a formal Co[d(yz)2 d(xz)2 d(z2)1 d(xy)1 d(x2&#8208;y2)1] O[p(z)2 p(y)1 p(x)1] representation and placing Co&#8943;O oxygen in a local atomic&#8208;like character. Lone pair electrons of water flow into SOMOs of the atomic&#8208;oxygen&#8208;like center&#8211;a picture different than the classical WNA mechanism, where two electrons are transferred to LUMO. This atomic&#8208;oxygen&#8208;like electronic structure is a key to understanding O&#8211;O bond formation and originates from an internally excited state of the Co&#8211;O center in the absence of water. The conventional three&#8208;electron quartet is restored when the O&#8211;O bond is generated. Local electronic structure of the atomic&#8208;like oxygen can be foreseen by the symmetry of the water approach coordinate, enabling the prediction of catalytic activity. Our findings were successfully tested on eight experimentally available metal&#8211;oxo complexes with distinct catalytic profiles, comprising both active and inactive compounds. Generalization of the current results to other metal&#8211;oxo systems in nucleophilic attack and/or small molecule activation reactions might be possible.

         <title>Unveiling Residual Charge Effects in the Direct Regeneration of Spent LiFePO4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, multiple characterizations and theoretical calculations are carried out to expound the physicochemical differences between the incompletely and fully discharged spent LiFePO4 (IDS&#8208;LFP and FDS&#8208;LFP), distinguishing and establishing a screening standard for them. Various regeneration methods are also employed to investigate the differences in regeneration effects between FDS&#8208;LFP and IDS&#8208;LFP under the same conditions. 








Abstract
The emergence of safe crushing technologies for spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries treatment will significantly increase the proportion of incompletely discharged spent LiFePO4 (IDS&#8208;LFP) in future recycling industry. The IDS&#8208;LFP and fully discharged S&#8208;LFP (FDS&#8208;LFP) with different residual charge show different microstructures and physicochemical properties. However, the current research in direct regeneration mainly focus on FDS&#8208;LFP, the regeneration of IDS&#8208;LFP and the relationship between residual charges and regeneration effect that has received less attention. Therefore, we classify the FDS&#8208;LFP and IDS&#8208;LFP based on their physicochemical properties and investigate the differences in their repair process using three kinds of regeneration methods. Compared to FDS&#8208;LFP, IDS&#8208;LFP exhibits a higher lithium intercalation energy barrier due to vacancies in the bulk. In addition, the proportion of FeLi anti&#8208;site defects in regenerated IDS&#8208;LFP (IDR&#8208;LFP) (1.3%) is higher than regenerated FDS&#8208;LFP (FDR&#8208;LFP) (0.6%), confirming that IDS&#8208;LFP cannot be completely regenerated. As a result, FDR&#8208;LFP delivers a specific discharge capacity of 137.1 mA h g&#8722;1 at 1 C, retaining 81.5% capacity retention after 400 cycles. In sharp contrast, IDR&#8208;LFP only provides a specific discharge capacity of 105.1 mA h g&#8722;1 at 1 C. This study provides foundational insights for handing S&#8208;LFP with varying residual charge.

&lt;p&gt;In this work, multiple characterizations and theoretical calculations are carried out to expound the physicochemical differences between the incompletely and fully discharged spent LiFePO4 (IDS-LFP and FDS-LFP), distinguishing and establishing a screening standard for them. Various regeneration methods are also employed to investigate the differences in regeneration effects between FDS-LFP and IDS-LFP under the same conditions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emergence of safe crushing technologies for spent lithium-ion batteries treatment will significantly increase the proportion of incompletely discharged spent LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (IDS-LFP) in future recycling industry.

         <title>From Plastic Waste to Pharmaceutical Precursors: PET Upcycling Through Ruthenium Catalyzed Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>

We present a new catalytic process that converts real&#8208;life PET waste into ethyl 4&#8208;hydroxymethylbenzoate (EHMB), which serves as a valuable intermediate for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, an insecticide, and a novel polyester.








Abstract
We report here the upcycling of PET (polyethylene terephthalate) waste via semihydrogenation to make ethyl 4&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)benzoate. The reaction is catalyzed by a ruthenium pincer catalyst at 80 &#176;C in bioderived solvents &#8211; a combination of 2&#8208;methyl THF and ethanol. A detailed mechanistic investigation through organometallic and kinetic studies, as well as chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) NMR spectroscopy, provides insights into the nature of active species and factors that promote and inhibit the catalytic hydrogenation of PET. Using this mechanistic knowledge, a record high turnover number of&#160;&gt;30&#160;000 was achieved for the hydrogenative depolymerization of end&#8208;of&#8208;life PET waste (e.g., bottles and textiles). The semihydrogenation product, ethyl 4&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)benzoate, was utilized to make precursors of various known pharmaceutical drugs, an agrochemical, as well as a new and recyclable polyester. A cradle&#8208;to&#8208;gate life cycle assessment demonstrated that using PET waste as a feedstock for EHMB production significantly reduces the environmental footprint compared to the conventional route from p&#8208;toluic acid.

         <title>Three&#8208;Motif Molecular Junction with Long&#8208;Lived Charge Carriers for Efficient Overall Photosynthesis of H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals that a covalently connected three&#8208;motif molecular junction synthesized via sequential polymerization significantly enhances visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven, sacrificial&#8208;agent&#8208;free H2O2 production (4302&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) from air and water by dramatically extending carrier lifetime (&#8764;12&#160;ns) and facilitating a stepwise one&#8208;electron oxygen reduction pathway.








Abstract
Photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from air and water has emerged as one of promising alternative strategies to the conventional anthraquinone process. Nevertheless, its practical development is impeded by limited charge separation efficiency and rapid charge&#8208;carrier recombination. In this study, a covalently connected molecular junction is synthesized via sequential Schiff and Knoevenagel polymerization reactions for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven and sacrificial&#8208;agent&#8208;free H2O2 synthesis. The molecular junction effectively promotes charge separation and enhances photocatalytic efficiency. Femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TAS) spectra reveals that construction of the three&#8208;motif molecular junction dramatically extends carrier lifetimes up to 12&#160;ns, which is about 100 times longer than the two&#8208;motif junction. As expected, the three&#8208;motif molecular junction (TAS4) exhibits an impressive photocatalytic H2O2 production rate of 4302&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under AM 1.5G irradiation without any sacrificial agent in air atmosphere, which is 2.4 and 2 times higher than that of the two&#8208;motif junctions (TA and TS). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) confirm that H2O2 production on three&#8208;motif molecular junction TAS4 occurs via a stepwise one&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). This work demonstrates the potential of molecular junction for efficient solar&#8208;driven H2O2 production.

         <title>AIMNet2&#8208;NSE: A Transferable Reactive Neural Network Potential for Open&#8208;Shell Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
AIMNet2&#8208;NSE enables accurate modeling of open&#8208;shell radical chemistry through neural spin&#8208;charge equilibration (NSE). This machine learning interatomic potential predicts radical reaction energies, barriers, and spin&#8208;crossing events with near&#8208;DFT accuracy while offering five orders of magnitude computational speedup, making high&#8208;throughput exploration of radical intermediates feasible for industrial applications.








Abstract
Open&#8208;shell systems such as radical intermediates are central to radical polymerization (RP), combustion, catalysis, and many other chemical and industrial processes, yet their accurate modeling presents significant computational challenges. Most of the current machine learning interatomic potentials do not distinguish between different spin states, making them unsuitable for open&#8208;shell reactive chemistry. Here we present AIMNet2&#8208;NSE (neural spin&#8208;charge equilibration), a neural network potential that incorporates spin&#8208;charge equilibration for accurate treatment of molecules and reactions with arbitrary charge and spin multiplicities. Built upon the AIMNet2 framework, AIMNet2&#8208;NSE is trained on an extensive dataset comprising 20 million closed&#8208;shell neutral and charged molecules, 13 million open&#8208;shell radical configurations, and 200K radical reaction profiles. With explicit handling of spin charges, AIMNet2&#8208;NSE enables prediction of spin&#8208;resolved properties with near&#8208;DFT accuracy while maintaining a favorable linear scaling compared to the polynomial scaling of electronic structure methods. The predictive capabilities and generalizability of our model are confirmed by evaluations on large&#8208;scale radical test sets, the industrially relevant BASChem19 benchmark, and RP reactions. Overall, AIMNet2&#8208;NSE represents a significant advancement in machine learning interatomic potentials, allowing efficient exploration of complex open&#8208;shell systems, and significantly advancing our ability to model radical reaction pathways and reactive intermediates in chemical processes where traditional quantum mechanical methods are computationally prohibitive.

         <title>Targeting the Spliceosomal Protein USP39 Through Allosteric Ligands and PROTAC&#8208;Induced Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) enable degradation of proteins previously considered undruggable by harnessing the cellular ubiquitin&#8211;proteasome system. In this study, Sch&#228;fer et&#160;al. identify thiazole&#8208;based small molecules that allosterically bind the zinc finger domain of ubiquitin&#8208;specific protease 39 (USP39), a non&#8208;enzymatic scaffold protein essential for spliceosome assembly and implicated in proteotoxicity&#8208;relevant diseases. These ligands were converted into PROTACs that effectively recruit E3 ligases, induce potent, selective USP39 degradation at nanomolar concentrations in cells.








Abstract
The precise regulation of gene expression is fundamental to cellular homeostasis and diversity. Dysregulation of splicing has been implicated in a range of diseases, including cancer and neurodegeneration. Ubiquitin&#8208;specific protease 39 (USP39), an essential spliceosome component lacking enzymatic activity, has remained an elusive target for pharmacological intervention. Here, we report the discovery of small&#8208;molecule ligands that selectively engage with USP39 through a thiazole scaffold, primarily interacting with its zinc finger domain. Guided by AlphaFold&#8208;based structure&#8211;activity relationship studies, we designed and optimized proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs), culminating in the development of USP39_PROTAC_V1, which harnesses the von Hippel&#8211;Lindau (VHL) E3 ubiquitin ligase for targeted degradation.

     alt="Targeting the Spliceosomal Protein USP39 Through Allosteric Ligands and PROTAC-Induced Degradation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) enable degradation of proteins previously considered undruggable by harnessing the cellular ubiquitin&#8211;proteasome system. In this study, Sch&#228;fer et&#160;al. identify thiazole-based small molecules that allosterically bind the zinc finger domain of ubiquitin-specific protease 39 (USP39), a non-enzymatic scaffold protein essential for spliceosome assembly and implicated in proteotoxicity-relevant diseases. These ligands were converted into PROTACs that effectively recruit E3 ligases, induce potent, selective USP39 degradation at nanomolar concentrations in cells.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The precise regulation of gene expression is fundamental to cellular homeostasis and diversity. Dysregulation of splicing has been implicated in a range of diseases, including cancer and neurodegeneration. Ubiquitin-specific protease 39 (USP39), an essential spliceosome component lacking enzymatic activity, has remained an elusive target for pharmacological intervention. Here, we report the discovery of small-molecule ligands that selectively engage with USP39 through a thiazole scaffold, primarily interacting with its zinc finger domain. Guided by AlphaFold-based structure&#8211;activity relationship studies, we designed and optimized proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs), culminating in the development of USP39_PROTAC_V1, which harnesses the von Hippel&#8211;Lindau (VHL) E3 ubiquitin ligase for targeted degradation. Biophysical and biochemical assays demonstrated potent ternary complex formation and nanomolar-range binding affinities. In cellular models, USP39_PROTACs achieved efficient degradation of USP39 at concentrations as low as 1&#160;nM, with minimal off-target effects as confirmed by proteome-wide profiling. Mechanistic studies revealed that degradation was dependent on VHL recruitment and was abrogated by proteasome or neddylation inhibition. Notably, USP39 depletion recapitulated 5&#8242;-splice-site-specific splicing patterns previously described, thereby validating both the mechanism of action and the therapeutic relevance of this approach&#8212;particularly for modulating splicing-associated disease pathways such as cancer and retinitis pigmentosa.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Stabilization Strategy for Inhibiting Metal Nanoparticle Sintering Over Ceria Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a novel dual&#8208;stabilization strategy of constructing &#8220;deeper well and taller wall&#8221; migration energetics via proper Ge doping to inhibit the sintering of industrially important nanometer&#8208;sized Pt/CeO2 catalysts, where the Ge dopant uniquely strengthens the local but weakens the distant metal&#8208;support interaction through Ge4+&#8594;Ge2+ reduction and sustains the highly dispersed Pt particles up to 800 &#176;C.








Abstract
Ceria supported noble metals are important commercial catalysts, however, the long&#8208;term stability suffering from metal particle sintering still challenges the practical benefits. This work determines the favorable migration pathway of supported Pt particles over CeO2 surface as well as three distinct trends of isomorphous substitution in modulating the metal&#8208;support interactions (MSIs), via extensive ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and density functional theory calculations with on&#8208;site Coulomb interaction correction. We find that, while several dopants (Ti, Ge, Sn) enhance the MSI upon contact with metal particles, Ge shows additionally an intriguing MSI weakening effect in the distant region, stemming from the reduction of tetravalence Ge into off&#8208;lattice Ge2+ cation (Ge4+ + 2Ce3+ &#8594; Ge2+ + 2Ce4+). Integrating with the dynamic bury&#8208;and&#8208;expose migratory structure inspires us to propose an effective sintering&#8208;resistance strategy of constructing dual&#8208;stabilization &#8220;deeper well and taller wall&#8221; migration energetics, simply by manipulating Ge doping content within an estimated threshold (roughly to be one tenth of Pt). Such approach can remarkably stabilize surface Pt particles with migration energy consumption being elevated by 1.80&#160;eV and exhibit broad applicability to other supported metals (e.g., Rh/CeO2), giving rise to excellent stability even under harsh experimental conditions of H2 atmosphere at 800&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Skeletal Editing of Hydroxyl Oxindoles via Organoiodine&#8208;Catalyzed Oxygen Atom Insertion Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organoiodine&#8208;catalyzed single&#8208;oxygen atom insertion of hydroxyl oxindoles with N&#8208;centered nucleophiles was established, enabling efficient access to structurally diverse six&#8208;membered N,O&#8208;heterocycles and providing a new organocatalytic strategy for skeletal editing. This work represents the first organocatalytic oxygen&#8208;insertion and the first application of hydroxyl oxindoles as substrates in skeletal editing. Furthermore, theoretical studies revealed the critical role of HFIP in facilitating the reaction.








Abstract
In the field of skeleton editing, the development of catalytic single&#8208;atom insertion into five&#8208;membered rings is highly desirable and holds significant synthetic value. While numerous transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed strategies have been established, organocatalytic single&#8208;atom insertions into five&#8208;membered rings remain scarce due to persistent challenges such as the development of competent organocatalytic systems and the identification of suitable five&#8208;membered heterocyclic substrates. To address this gap, we have developed a novel organoiodine&#8208;catalyzed single&#8208;oxygen atom insertion reaction employing hydroxyl oxindoles and N&#8208;centered nucleophiles such as triazoles, indazoles, and purine derivatives to access a broad range of structurally diverse six&#8208;membered N,O&#8208;heterocycles. Control experiments and theoretical calculations provide deep insight into the reaction mechanism and the activation mode underlying this organoiodine&#8208;catalyzed transformation. Notably, theoretical studies reveal that hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP) plays a critical role by forming multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding and C&#9472;H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#960; interactions with the reactants, thereby facilitating the single&#8208;oxygen atom insertion. This work constitutes the first example of organocatalytic oxygen atom insertion in molecular skeletal editing and marks the first use of hydroxyl oxindoles as substrates in this context, enabling skeletal editing of five&#8208;membered non&#8208;aromatic heterocycles. Moreover, this study presents a successful case of catalytic intermolecular oxidation within organoiodine chemistry, thereby contributing substantially to related research areas.

Atomically dispersed Ni sites embedded in a boron/nitrogen co&#8208;doped carbon nanotube matrix (Ni&#8208;BNC) steer the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) toward H2O2 with high efficiency. Ni&#8208;BNC delivers &gt;90% Faradaic efficiency for H2O2 at current densities up to &#8764;400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and reaches a production rate of 31.13&#160;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. The results highlight atomic&#8208;level B&#8208;N&#8208;Ni synergy as a decisive lever for industrially relevant peroxide electrosynthesis beyond conventional single&#8208;heteroatom designs.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts have emerged as cost&#8208;effective alternatives to noble metals for the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR); however, their practical application in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrosynthesis remains limited by persistent trade&#8208;offs among activity, selectivity, and stability. Herein, we demonstrate that synergistic integration of atomically dispersed Ni and B, N co&#8208;dopants within a carbon matrix (Ni&#8208;BNC) effectively regulates the 2e&#8722; ORR for efficient H2O2 production. The Ni&#8208;BNC catalyst delivers&#160;&gt;90% Faradaic efficiency for H2O2&#160;at current densities up to &#8764;&#8722;400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and critically maintains this high selectivity for over 50&#160;h at &#8722;100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell, achieving a maximum production rate of 31.13&#160;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. In situ infrared spectroscopy and kinetic analysis revealed that B, N&#8208;coordination facilitates electron transfer from adjacent single Ni atoms, electronically modulating the *OOH adsorption energy and lowering the kinetic barrier. The practical viability is further demonstrated in a porous solid electrolyte reactor, which continuously produces pure, salt&#8208;free H2O2 (&gt;1,400&#160;ppm) for 100&#160;h. This work highlights the effectiveness of atomic&#8208;level synergy for designing advanced electrocatalysts beyond sole active&#8208;site engineering.

         <title>Photochemical Deracemization of Chromanes and its Application to the Synthesis of Enantiopure Bioactive Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various substituted chromane&#8208;2&#8208;carboxamides were successfully deracemized by employing a chiral benzophenone (BP, 10 mol%) as photocatalyst and an achiral thiol as additive (20 mol%). The method was applied to the concise enantioselective synthesis of five active pharmaceutical ingredients.








Abstract
Chromanes are frequently encountered as chiral structure elements in active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). We have now discovered an access to enantiopure chromanes, which employs a 1:1 mixture of their enantiomers (racemate) in a photochemical deracemization reaction (21 examples, 71%&#8211;90% yield, 80%&#8211;99% ee). A chiral photocatalyst (10 mol%) acts by selective hydrogen abstraction at one chromane enantiomer and establishes a photostationary state in which the other enantiomer prevails. A thiol additive (20 mol%) was found to improve the enantioselectivity of the process. The mechanism of the reaction was investigated by experimental and quantum&#8208;chemical studies. The oxygen atom of the chromane locks the rotation around the exocyclic C&#9472;C bond to the amide by forming an intramolecular hydrogen bond. Forward hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) occurs exclusively in one diastereomeric complex via a readily accessible transition state. Reasonable pathways for back HAT were identified which are in line with deuterium labeling experiments. The method was applied to the concise preparation of five chromane&#8208;containing drugs (Doxazosin, Fidarestat, Nebivolol, Repinotan, Sarizotan) as single enantiomers.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Controlled Synthesis of Corannulene&#8208;Based Multi&#8208;Helicenes: Highly Integrated Curvature/Planarity for Enhanced CPL Brightness and Solid&#8208;State Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bowl&#8208;shaped corannulene and planar HBC were maximally hybridized, showcasing the temperature&#8208;controlled product selectivity. One of hybrid resembles a propeller structure, while the other features an incomplete propeller combined with a nonagon. The curved core significantly enhances molecular strain, improving chiral response and BCPL, while suppressed &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking alleviates solid&#8208;state fluorescence quenching.








Abstract
Corannulene and hexabenzocoronene (HBC), as archetypal bowl&#8208;shaped and planar nanographene, have attracted considerable interest. Highly integrating these complementary motifs into a single architecture, however, remains a challenge owing to considerable intramolecular strains. Here, we report a temperature&#8208;controlled synthesis that enables selective hybridization between corannulene and multiple HBC&#8208;like motifs, yielding the anticipated quintuple [8]helicene (Cor&#8208;5H) and an unexpected triple [8]helicene (Cor&#8208;4H) incorporating a rare nonagon, likely involving a phenyl shift rearrangement mechanism. DFT calculations provide insights into the preferential formation of Cor&#8208;5H at lower temperatures, while Cor&#8208;4H predominates at elevated temperatures. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction confirms their hybrid bowl&#8211;helix topologies, in which a central corannulene is fused with four (Cor&#8208;4H) or five (Cor&#8208;5H) HBC&#8208;like blades. The significant steric constraint imposed by the curved core results in high strain energies. This synergistic integration of curvature and planarity endows both compounds with intense deep&#8208;red to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence; enhanced chiroptical responses and high circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) brightness; as well as unusual solid&#8208;state fluorescence due to suppressed &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. As the largest &#960;&#8208;extended corannulene&#8208;based multiple [n]helicenes reported to date, Cor&#8208;5H and Cor&#8208;4H demonstrate the powerful potential of fusing curved and planar nanographene motifs to design materials with advanced chiroptical functions.

         <title>Organoplatinum(II) J&#8208;Aggregates with Prolonged Triplet Lifetimes for Enhanced Photodynamic and Photocatalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the Pt(II) complexes capable of self&#8208;assembling into J&#8208;aggregates. The J&#8208;aggregates exhibit a prolonged triplet excited&#8208;state lifetime and enhanced triplet sensitization, which collectively boost their photodynamic and photocatalytic performance, leading to significantly improved tumor ablation efficacy.








Abstract
J&#8208;aggregates have demonstrated superior phototherapeutic performance compared to their monomeric counterparts. However, the underlying mechanisms for this enhancement are not fully understood. In this work, we report two near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;emissive organoplatinum(II) complexes, Pt&#8208;2TPE and Pt&#8208;2TPA, which self&#8208;assemble into J&#8208;aggregates via Pt&#8208;Pt and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. Theoretical calculations reveal that J&#8208;aggregates possess lower LUMO energy levels and reduced singlet&#8211;triplet energy gaps compared to their monomers, indicating enhanced electron&#8208;accepting ability and more efficient intersystem crossing (ISC). Transient absorption spectroscopy confirmed a dramatically prolonged triplet excited&#8208;state lifetime in Pt&#8208;2TPA J&#8208;aggregates (5.8 &#181;s) versus the monomer (123&#160;ns). The efficient oxygen quenching of this long&#8208;lived triplet excited&#8208;state verified enhanced triplet&#8208;state population and sensitization in the J&#8208;aggregates. Consequently, the J&#8208;aggregates efficiently generate Type I/II reactive oxygen species (ROS) and catalyze NADH oxidation under red light, leading to effective eradication of B16&#8208;F10 cells under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, a biotin&#8208;modified nanoformulation (Biotin@Pt&#8208;2TPA) exhibits excellent tumor accumulation and tumor growth suppression in vivo. This work provides a strategy to enhance the efficacy of photodynamic and photocatalytic therapy of platinum(II) complexes.

         <title>Engineering Gas&#8208;Releasing Polymersome Nanoreactors for Selective Biocatalytic Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the rational design of a glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsive polymersome nanoreactor system with selective activation. Upon GSH stimulation, these glucose oxidase (GOx)&#8208;loaded polymersome nanoreactors are capable of releasing SO2, which enhances the permeability of the polymersome membrane, thereby activating the nanoreactors&#8217; biocatalytic activity.








Abstract
Polymersomes, often referred to as polymeric vesicles, can act as nanoreactors by encapsulating enzymes within their aqueous lumen. However, most polymersome systems exhibit low membrane permeability, hindering substrate exchange and thus posing a critical challenge to their application as nanoreactors. Herein, we report the design of a glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsive polymersome nanoreactor system with selective intracellular biocatalytic activation. Upon GSH stimulation, the glucose oxidase (GOx)&#8208;loaded polymersome nanoreactors are capable of releasing SO2, which enhances the permeability of the polymersome membrane, thereby activating biocatalysis to convert glucose into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In vitro studies confirmed the successful cellular uptake of nanoreactors, and importantly, the biocatalytic reaction was only activated within cancer cells due to the overexpressed GSH levels, suggesting the system's &#8220;ON/OFF&#8221; selectivity. Moreover, the GOx&#8208;mediated catalytic reactions, coupled with the concurrent generation of SO2, enabled the polymersome nanoreactors to exhibit enhanced cancer cell&#8208;killing capacity by modulating intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. This work presents a new strategy for selective biocatalytic activation of nanoreactors, providing a promising platform for the development of functional polymersome systems.

         <title>Confined Chiral Center Stacking Induced Twisted Silica Nanoribbons for Tumor Cell Proliferation Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work employs silica co&#8208;assembly to impart a longitudinal stacking force within a confined space, inducing and stabilizing mesostructured chirality in peptide amphiphiles, yielding uniform twisted nanoribbons. Without any drug loading, this chiral architecture inhibits tumor cell proliferation by up to 60% by suppressing cell adhesion and activating apoptosis. This study highlights the crucial role of inter&#8208;component confinement in the construction of mesostructured chirality and its direct biological consequences.








Abstract
Chirality governs physiological processes across scales, yet the ambiguous link between molecular chirality and mesostructured chirality persists. Here, we show that while peptide amphiphiles with molecular chirality can assemble into achiral nanostructures, the co&#8208;assembly with silanes leads to left&#8208;handed helical&#8208;twisted nanoribbons and generates tumor cell activity inhibitory properties. The as&#8208;synthesized micrometer&#8208;long nanoribbons have a uniform morphology with a pitch of &#8764;340 nm, a width of &#8764;75 nm, and a thickness of &#8764;25 nm. An increase in the proportion of silane&#8208;peptide amphiphile modulates the pitch radius ratios from 4.5 to 10.4. It is proposed that the longitudinal stacking force toward the chiral centers during the silane crosslinking can successfully induce chirality transfer from the molecular to the mesostructure. Theoretical calculations confirm this mechanism reduces surface area by 35%. Without drugs, these twisted nanoribbons inhibit tumor cell activity by up to 60%, versus &lt;30% for achiral assemblies. RNA sequencing reveals that mesostructured chirality triggers apoptosis by suppressing cell adhesion and ultimately disrupting cellular metabolism. Our study focuses on the easily overlooked molecular interactions between multiple components during mesostructured chirality formation and the biofeedback role of mesostructured chirality, providing new perspectives for understanding the evolution and significance of chirality in nature.

         <title>Hexabenzocoronene&#8211;Benzimidazole Hybrid Architectures and Faraday Rotation of the First Hexabenzocoronene&#8211;Phthalocyanine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of four hexabenzocoronene (HBC) benzimidazole hybrid molecules is shown, culminating in tetra&#8208;HBC&#8208;Ni&#8208;phthalocyanine (Pc). Its application as a Faraday rotator reveals a remarkable Verdet constant. The compounds are fully characterized and their optoelectronic properties investigated by electrochemistry, UV&#8211;vis, and fluorescence spectroscopy. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the experimental data.








Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of a first example of a Ni&#8208;phthalocyanine (Pc) hybrid molecule carrying four hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) substituents and of three HBC&#8208;benzimidazole derivatives is reported. These &#960;&#8208;electron rich chromophores exhibit a high molar absorption coefficient with extended absorption up to 460&#160;nm. Particularly, HBC&#8208;Pc absorbs throughout most of the UV&#8211;vis range with the Pc Q&#8208;band located at 672&#160;nm. This enables its investigation as a Faraday rotator where it displayed a remarkable Verdet constant of &#8722;1.4&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;deg&#160;T&#8722;1m&#8722;1 at 700&#160;nm assigned to Faraday A&#8208;term activity. Electrochemical measurements supported by DFT calculations elucidated the electronic structure of the molecules together with excited state molecular orbital analysis using TDDFT. Here, HBC&#8208;Pc showed a HOMO/LUMO gap considerably lower than the other HBC&#8208;based compounds due to the introduction of the Pc scaffold.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Structural Distortion Drives Exciton Localization for Near&#8208;Unity Photoluminescence in Copper&#8211;Iodide Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>

Amplifying self&#8208;trapped emission to near&#8208;unity quantum yield by atomic&#8208;level distortion control in a soft copper&#8211;iodide lattice involving two vertically oriented and alternately arranged [Cu2I4]6&#8722; clusters.








Abstract
Engineering structural distortions presents a powerful strategy for tailoring the optoelectronic properties of luminescent materials, while a fundamental understanding of how atomic&#8208;scale distortions govern photoluminescence in copper&#8208;iodide clusters has remained elusive. Herein, we report a model van der Waals solid based on copper&#8211;iodide clusters, where two vertically oriented and alternately arranged [Cu2I4]2&#8722; clusters are assembled via protection and interaction afforded by peripheral long&#8208;alkyl&#8208;chain cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ligands. This unique architecture affords a cooperative distortion response and exceptional buffering capacity, enabling precise control and direct probing of atomic&#8208;scale structural distortions under pressure. We demonstrate that hydrostatic pressure induces controlled atomic distortions and an isostructural phase transition, which collectively enhance exciton localization. This leads to a dramatic amplification of self&#8208;trapped emission, boosting the photoluminescence quantum yield from 32.25% to near&#8208;unity (99.82%). Our work establishes atomic&#8208;distortion engineering as a general principle for achieving ultimate control over light emission in hybrid semiconductors.

         <title>Protein&#8208;Triggered Reassembly of Quinocyanine Nanosheets for Intraoperative NIR&#8208;II Cholangiography</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>

A protein&#8208;triggered reassembly probe, QCG, forms quenched &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked nanosheets that reorganize into bright dye&#8211;hemoglobin complexes in bile, enabling intraoperative NIR&#8208;II Cholangiography imaging.








Abstract
Intraoperative near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence imaging offers high&#8208;contrast, real&#8208;time visualization during surgery, yet the development of activatable probes remains a formidable challenge because most tissue&#8208;specific biomarkers, such as receptor proteins, are chemically inert intrinsic. Here, we present a protein&#8208;triggered reassembly strategy in which planar NIR&#8208;II dyes pre&#8208;assemble into &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked aggregates with quenched fluorescence that reorganize into highly emissive dye&#8208;protein complexes upon target binding, thereby achieving activatable intraoperative imaging. Compared with indocyanine green (ICG), a clinically approved &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; cholangiography&#160;agent, quinocyanine green (QCG) was developed as a bile specifical&#160;activated NIR&#8208;II probe through stepwise molecular engineering. Native PAGE, protein sequencing, and TEM analyses all revealed that a hemoglobin subunit in bile drives the transformation of the initial QCG nanosheets into uniform homogeneous spherical protein&#8208;dye complexes, yielding a remarkable 310&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement at 1011&#160;nm. Taking such advantage, for the first time, we have clearly and directly visualized intrahepatic bile duct in vivo. Moreover, QCG afforded high&#8208;contrast, precise intraoperative cholangiography, allowing detailed biliary tree mapping, stricture identification, bile leakage detection, and dual&#8208;color hepatobiliary imaging. This in situ reassembly strategy establishes a generalizable molecular design principle for activatable NIR&#8208;II probes and expands the toolbox for precision fluorescence&#8208;guided surgery.

         <title>A Phosphorus&#8208;Bridged Spin Trigger for Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
How does phosphorus (P) boost the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the composite active site? In our Fe single&#8208;atom/cluster catalyst (FeSA/AC/PNC), P bridges the Fe species (FeSA&#8208;P&#8208;FeAC), triggering a spin&#8208;state transition while simultaneously serving as an electron bridge. The dual effect optimizes reaction kinetics, enabling superior performance in both acidic/neutral media and fuel cells. Moreover, this mechanism proves universally effective for Co&#8208; and Ni&#8208;based catalysts.








Abstract
Precise control over the spin degree of freedom of catalytic metal centers represents a significant challenge in enhancing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In this work, we report a phosphorus(P)&#8208;bridged composite comprising Fe single atoms (SAs) and atomic clusters (ACs), FeSA/AC/PNC, wherein the FeSA&#8208;P&#8208;FeAC structure functions as an efficient electron channel and, more importantly, a spin trigger. This trigger induces a spin&#8208;state transition of FeII from low&#8208;spin (S&#160;=&#160;0) to medium&#8208;spin (S&#160;=&#160;1), as unequivocally deciphered by advanced spectroscopic and magnetic analyses. This spin&#8208;state reconstruction directly optimizes the reaction pathway by enhancing O2 adsorption and facilitating *OH desorption.

     alt="A Phosphorus-Bridged Spin Trigger for Oxygen Reduction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does phosphorus (P) boost the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the composite active site? In our Fe single-atom/cluster catalyst (Fe&lt;sub&gt;SA/AC&lt;/sub&gt;/PNC), P bridges the Fe species (Fe&lt;sub&gt;SA&lt;/sub&gt;-P-Fe&lt;sub&gt;AC&lt;/sub&gt;), triggering a spin-state transition while simultaneously serving as an electron bridge. The dual effect optimizes reaction kinetics, enabling superior performance in both acidic/neutral media and fuel cells. Moreover, this mechanism proves universally effective for Co- and Ni-based catalysts.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precise control over the spin degree of freedom of catalytic metal centers represents a significant challenge in enhancing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In this work, we report a phosphorus(P)-bridged composite comprising Fe single atoms (SAs) and atomic clusters (ACs), Fe&lt;sub&gt;SA/AC&lt;/sub&gt;/PNC, wherein the Fe&lt;sub&gt;SA&lt;/sub&gt;-P-Fe&lt;sub&gt;AC&lt;/sub&gt; structure functions as an efficient electron channel and, more importantly, a spin trigger. This trigger induces a spin-state transition of Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; from low-spin (S&#160;=&#160;0) to medium-spin (S&#160;=&#160;1), as unequivocally deciphered by advanced spectroscopic and magnetic analyses. This spin-state reconstruction directly optimizes the reaction pathway by enhancing O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption and facilitating *OH desorption. The resulting catalyst exhibits exceptional oxygen reduction activity in both acidic and neutral media, with half-wave potentials of 0.852 and 0.831&#160;V, respectively, and achieves a peak power density of 1.35&#160;W cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs).

         <title>Rational Integration of Amino Functionalization and Catalytic Site Modulation in Zr&#8208;MOFs for Synergistic Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a versatile platform enabling precise modulation of the primary building blocks (PBBs) and secondary building blocks (SBBs) in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) was constructed. This research aims to address the challenge where PBBs and SBBs have struggled to improve properties in a coordinated manner while providing a novel approach to enhance the photocatalytic performance of relatively inert Zr&#8208;MOFs








Abstract
The modular nature endows metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with structural precision and functional programmability. However, the predefined structural constraints of precursors and confined post&#8208;synthetic environments pose significant challenges for achieving cooperative regulation of dual modules toward unified functionality. Herein, a versatile platform enabling precise modulation of the primary building blocks (PBBs) and secondary building blocks (SBBs) was constructed. The synergistic effect between the amino functionalization of the PBBs and the regulation of catalytic sites focusing on SBBs significantly enhances the efficiency of photocatalytic processes. The photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of NKM&#8208;818&#8208;BDBPt can reach 871&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, which is 10.62 times higher than that of NKM&#8208;818@Pt. This work establishes a new paradigm for exploring synergistic interactions among modular components in MOFs, and contributes to the further development of coordination&#8208;engineering&#8208;driven single&#8208;site photocatalysts with excellent activity.

         <title>Hydroxyl Radicals Unlock Strong C(sp3)&#9472;Si Bonds: Photocatalytic Alkylation and Silacycle Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radical C(sp3)&#9472;Si bond functionalization of strong tetraorganosilicon compounds enabled by photocatalytic hydroxyl/alkoxyl radicals generated from water or alcohols has been developed. The reaction system demonstrates broad substrate scope, accommodating a variety of non&#8208;activated alkyl silanes and electron&#8208;deficient alkenes, while maintaining compatibility with diverse functional groups. This approach not only provides a new method for C&#9472;Si bond cleavage and transformation but also offers a strategy for synthesizing silicon&#8208;containing compounds via radical ring&#8208;opening difunctionalization of silacycles.








Abstract
Organosilicon reagents play a significant role in the preparation of molecules essential to synthetic chemistry, materials science, and medicinal chemistry. However, selectively transforming strong C(sp3)&#9472;Si bonds in unactivated organosilicon reagents remains a significant challenge due to their high stability and low reactivity. Herein, we report that hydroxyl radical generated from water (H2O) can effectively drive the homolysis of strong C(sp3)&#9472;Si bonds, enabling radical alkylation with electron&#8208;deficient alkenes. We reveal that H2O facilitates the generation of alkyl radicals, including tertiary, secondary, and primary radicals. Even the inert Et4Si can be activated and used in radical alkylation under our methodology. Moreover, we show that this strategy can be applied to the radical difunctionalization of silacycles, leading to the synthesis of organosilicon compounds not previously achievable through other methods. We anticipate that this approach will serve as a foundation for the development of more advanced radical reactions with unactivated organosilicon reagents, thereby facilitating the synthesis of a wide range of valuable molecules.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Triggered Anion Transport Induces Cancer Cell Death</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>

Photo&#8208;responsive transmembrane anion transporters that are activated with NIR light are reported. Experiments in cancer cells revealed that NIR activation of the ionophore triggered near&#8208;IR light&#8208;dependent chloride influx and triggered cell death.








Abstract
Artificial transmembrane anion carriers have shown potential in biological research and medicine, such as chemotherapeutics to treat channelopathies and anticancer agents. Stimuli&#8208;responsive systems, controlled by triggers such as light, pH, redox, enzymes, or membrane potential, offer the potential for targeted activation. Photoactivation of ion transport is particularly advantageous due to the possibility of achieving spatiotemporal control, remote addressability, and reduced cytotoxicity. However, poor tissue penetration and undesired cytotoxicity are significant drawbacks to many photo&#8208;activated ionophores reported to date, which are mostly triggered by UV or violet light. Here, we report BODIPY&#8208;caged photo&#8208;responsive anionophores activated with NIR light, which utilize dynamic hydrogen bonding interactions of a 4&#8208;hydroxyisophthalamide motif. Caging of the hydroxyl group of the anionophore with BODIPY&#8208;photocages locks the amide proton through six&#8208;membered intramolecular hydrogen bonding, rendering it unavailable for anion recognition and transport. Decaging with 730&#160;nm NIR irradiation reverses the hydrogen bonding pattern to switch on binding, with efficient off&#8208;on activation profiles observed in anion transport experiments in vesicles. Analogous experiments in cancer cells revealed turn&#8208;on transmembrane chloride transport and a dramatic, dose&#8208;dependent decrease in cell viability following NIR decaging of the anionophore, demonstrating the potential for NIR&#8208;triggered ionophores as an alternative to existing photodynamic therapies for cancer.

A phase transition&#8211;guided route enables selective synthesis of Mn&#8208;doped Cs&#8211;Cd&#8211;Cl scintillators with tunable afterglow. The CsCdCl3:Mn, showing the strongest scintillation afterglow, supports high&#8208;resolution flexible time&#8208;lapse X&#8208;ray imaging and thermally stimulated retrieval of stored images.








Abstract
X&#8208;ray time&#8208;lapse flexible imaging and information retrieval significantly broaden the application scope of X&#8208;ray technologies, while posing new challenges for the design of advanced scintillators. Herein, we report a phase transition&#8211;guided strategy for the rational design of Mn&#8208;doped ternary cadmium chlorides long afterglow emitters, wherein crystal growth dynamics are precisely modulated via solubility&#8208;controlled synthesis. By sequentially preparing powders and single crystals of Cs2CdCl4:Mn, Cs3Cd2Cl7:Mn, and CsCdCl3:Mn, we achieve phase&#8208;selective synthesis through fine&#8208;tuning of mixed solvent ratios, establishing a robust framework for phase engineering in the Mn&#8208;doped Cs&#8211;Cd&#8211;Cl system. Among them, CsCdCl3:Mn exhibits the highest trap density, resulting in a pronounced scintillation afterglow. Benefiting from this unique property, a flexible scintillating film fabricated by embedding phosphor powders into a polymer matrix enables high&#8208;resolution time&#8208;lapse X&#8208;ray imaging (13.6 lp mm&#8722;1), along with thermally stimulated image retrieval after X&#8208;ray exposure. This work not only presents a generalizable approach for phase&#8208;controlled afterglow modulation in Mn&#8208;doped chlorides, but also offers new avenues toward flexible, high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray scintillators with delayed visualization capabilities.

Among them, CsCdCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;:Mn exhibits the highest trap density, resulting in a pronounced scintillation afterglow. Benefiting from this unique property, a flexible scintillating film fabricated by embedding phosphor powders into a polymer matrix enables high-resolution time-lapse X-ray imaging (13.6 lp mm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), along with thermally stimulated image retrieval after X-ray exposure. This work not only presents a generalizable approach for phase-controlled afterglow modulation in Mn-doped chlorides, but also offers new avenues toward flexible, high-performance X-ray scintillators with delayed visualization capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Radical Cascade with Double Intramolecular Hydrogen Atom Transfer for the Generation of Bisfunctionalized Cyclopentanes from Linear Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radical cascade process involving the activation of two aliphatic C&#8211;H bonds in a series of five elementary steps converts readily available terminal alkynes into functionalized cyclopentylmethyl arylsulfones. The methodology delivers flexible synthetic intermediates and was applied to the preparation of diquinanes and triquinanes possessing a rare trans ring junction.








Abstract
Radical cascade reactions represent a powerful synthetic tool for the preparation of complex molecules from easily assembled starting materials. The incorporation of an intramolecular hydrogen atom transfer step in the cascade enhances considerably the level of complexity that can be achieved in a single synthetic operation. We describe here an efficient radical cascade process that involves the activation of two aliphatic C&#8211;H bonds in a series of five elementary steps. It converts efficiently readily available terminal alkynes into functionalized cyclopentylmethyl arylsulfones, which are highly valuable and flexible synthetic intermediates, as demonstrated by the preparation of diquinanes and triquinanes possessing a rare trans ring junction. This work illustrates also the unique reactivity of &#945;&#8208;sulfonylated alkyl radicals in C&#8211;H bond activation processes.

         <title>Amorphous Zero&#8208;Dimensional Organic Metal Halide Hybrid Scintillators with High Light Yield and Fast Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a rational molecular design strategy to develop solution&#8208;processed amorphous 0D OMHH scintillators, combining strong X&#8208;ray absorption by metal halides with efficient, short&#8208;decay&#8208;lifetime emission from organic cations. The resulting amorphous 0D (DMAC&#8208;TPP)2ZnBr4 films deliver exceptional performance, including the highest absolute light yield (~227,000 photons MeV&#8722;1) yet achieved for OMHH scintillators with nanosecond decay times (&#8764;8.00&#160;ns), and enable flexible, low&#8208;cost devices such as wearable scintillating fabrics for X&#8208;ray imaging.








Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic metal halide hybrids (OMHHs) have recently emerged as a promising class of scintillation materials, offering advantages in performance, tunability, environmental friendliness, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. While numerous 0D OMHH scintillators have been developed to date, most of them rely on radioluminescence (RL) originating from metal halide species with long decay lifetimes and are typically prepared as small&#8208;sized single crystals via a slow solution growth process. Here, we report for the first time high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray scintillators based on facile, solution&#8208;processed amorphous 0D OMHH films that exhibit efficient RL with short decay lifetimes enabled by molecular sensitization. By reacting a rationally designed green&#8208;emitting organic halide, (4&#8208;(9,9&#8208;dimethylacridin&#8208;10(9H)&#8208;yl)phenyl)triphenylphosphonium bromide (DMAC&#8208;TPPBr), with zinc bromide (ZnBr2), we have obtained amorphous 0D (DMAC&#8208;TPP)2ZnBr4 films that exhibit outstanding optical and scintillation properties, with a high photoluminescence quantum yield of &#8764;85%, a short photoluminescence decay lifetime (&#8764;12.5&#160;ns), a high absolute light yield of &#8764;27,000 photons MeV&#8722;1, a radioluminescence decay lifetime of &#8764;8.00&#160;ns, and a low limit of detection (LOD) of &#8764;9.00 nGyair s&#8722;1. By leveraging the benefits of solution&#8208;processed amorphous OMHHs with molecular sensitization, our approach paves a new pathway toward scalable, low&#8208;cost, and fast&#8208;response X&#8208;ray scintillators.

         <title>A Boron&#8208;Doped Buckybowl with a C42B2 Core: Synthesis, Crystal Structure, and Optoelectronic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A boron&#8208;doped buckybowl, C42B2, was rationally designed and constructed through region&#8208;cyclization&#8208;induced curvature. This molecule exhibits a highly stable bowl&#8208;shaped geometry, along with several unexpected photophysical and electronic properties, including narrowband fluorescence, stimulated emission, and amplified spontaneous emission, demonstrating the significant contributions of the boron atoms.








Abstract
Constructing curved topologies of and/or doping heteroatoms into molecular carbons are of importance for synthetic chemistry and materials science. Herein, we disclose a boron&#8208;doped buckybowl, which was realized by region&#8208;cyclization&#8208;induced curvature of an organoboron &#960;&#8208;system. Its synthesis was enabled by consecutive alkyne&#8208;based annulation and palladium&#8208;catalyzed regional C&#8211;H arylation. This molecule features a C42B2 polycyclic &#960;&#8208;skeleton containing two pentagonal rings, and has a highly stable bowl&#8208;shaped geometry, thus representing an unprecedented kind of curved heterocyclic molecular carbons. Notably, a few unexpected photophysical properties were achieved, including narrowband red fluorescence, stimulated emission, and amplified spontaneous emission. All of these properties have never been reported in other all&#8208;carbon and heterocyclic buckybowls, and demonstrate that such boron&#8208;doped buckybowls are promising for use as narrowband emitters and optical&#8208;gain materials. Additionally, it shows a four&#8208;step reversible reduction activity, revealing its efficient electron&#8208;accepting capability contributed by the boron atoms and pentagonal rings.

In the Research Article (e19150), Hui Liu, Jianming Zhang, Yingjie Zhao, and co&#8208;workers reveal solvent&#8208;directed in situ stacking modulation in 2D COFs. Changing the reaction solvent switches the interlayer arrangement between AA and AB without altering the linkers, reshaping the pore architecture. The AA&#8208;stacked COF exhibits straighter channels and delivers enhanced selectivity for xylene isomer separation.

         <title>Thiophene Derivatives as Versatile Precursors for (Hetero)Arene and Natural Product Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hidden but Powerful: Thiophenes and their saturated analogues have been demonstrated to be versatile C4&#8208;building blocks that can be rapidly applied to natural product synthesis and the construction of functionalized (hetero)arenes. This minireview aims to provide a concise overview of the strategies and implementations of these sulfur&#8208;containing heterocyclic precursors in challenging synthetic applications.








Abstract
Thiophenes and their saturated analogues are versatile C4&#8208;building blocks used to construct structurally intricate ring systems found in various biologically active structures. For instance, thiophenes can undergo dearomative cycloaddition reactions under photocatalytic conditions forming highly substituted benzenes. Thiophene S&#8208;oxides and S,S&#8208;dioxides have emerged as valuable precursors for the construction of complex frameworks in (4&#160;+&#160;2)/retro&#8208;(4&#160;+&#160;1) cascade reactions through cheletropic release of SO or SO2, respectively. In addition, 2,5&#8208;dihydrothiophenes can be rapidly converted into furans or pyrroles via pericyclic cascade reactions. The installation of a tetrahydrothiophene followed by reductive deletion of the sulfur atom has been demonstrated to be a powerful method for the cis&#8208;dialkylation of electron&#8208;poor olefins. The ability to generate highly complex, aromatic scaffolds and quaternary stereocenters makes thiophene compounds valuable intermediates for synthesizing natural products and bioactive molecules, which are important for crop science and medicinal chemistry. This minireview provides an overview of strategies for using these sulfur&#8208;containing heterocyclic precursors in challenging synthetic applications.

         <title>Deciphering Eg Occupancy Descriptor in Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The eg occupancy serves as a pivotal descriptor for oxygen electrocatalysis, integrating multidimensional electronic factors into a unified predictive framework. Governing the mechanisms and kinetics of OER/ORR by regulating intermediate adsorption, it can be precisely tuned via heteroatom doping and interface engineering. A deep understanding of its principles, rooted in coordination chemistry and probed by XAS and DFT, is key to designing eg&#8208;optimized, noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for sustainable energy conversion.








Abstract
Single variable descriptors serve as pivotal tools for evaluating catalyst performance, elucidating reaction mechanisms and guiding catalyst design in electrocatalysis. Among the existing oxygen electrocatalysis descriptors, eg occupancy stands out for integrating multidimensional electronic factors into a quantitative framework, enabling precise prediction of activity/selectivity trends. However, a comprehensive model for translating the mechanistic insights of eg occupancy into rational catalyst design remains underdeveloped. This review bridges this gap through a systematic analysis of eg occupancy across five dimensions: 1) fundamental principles of eg occupancy tuning via transition metal coordination environments, 2) characterization techniques for eg occupancy determination, 3) its governing role in oxygen evolution/reduction reaction (OER/ORR) mechanisms and kinetics, 4) precise eg occupancy tuning strategies for material design, and 5) emerging challenges and future perspectives in rational catalyst design. By integrating these perspectives, this work not only deciphers the mechanistic link between eg occupancy and catalytic activities but also establishes design principles for eg&#8208;optimized electrocatalysts, thereby advancing next&#8208;generation oxygen electrocatalysts beyond noble&#8208;metal benchmarks for sustainable energy applications (e.g., fuel cells, water electrolyzers, and zinc&#8208;air batteries).

         <title>The Expanding Horizons of Chemodynamic Therapy: From Fenton Chemistry to Radical&#8208;Driven Biological Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by recent advances in fundamental research and biomedical applications of chemodynamic therapy (CDT), this review integrates progress in reaction&#8208;center engineering, electron&#8208;state modulation, radical&#8208;driven biological mechanisms, and newly identified subcellular targets. It highlights therapeutic opportunities and proposes a new conceptual framework, presenting a forward&#8208;looking roadmap for CDT research and clinical translation.








Abstract
Since the integration of Fenton chemistry into biomedicine, chemodynamic therapy (CDT) has rapidly emerged as a vibrant interdisciplinary research frontier. In recent years, exciting advances in both the fundamental understanding and the attractive applications of CDT have greatly enriched the field, expanding its conceptual boundaries and therapeutic potential. In this review, we first summarize the advances in CDT from a chemical perspective, including strategies to optimize reaction centers at the electronic level and approaches to refine reaction environments through cellular metabolic regulation. We then discuss emerging insights into hydroxyl radical (&#183;OH)&#8211;mediated biological mechanisms and effects, including CDT&#8208;related cell death pathways, newly identified subcellular therapeutic targets, and the growing applications of CDT in antibacterial therapy, wound healing, and immune activation. Furthermore, we summarize ongoing efforts toward clinical translation and outline key challenges and perspectives from a translational standpoint. More importantly, we propose an expanded conceptual framework for CDT in response to the evolving research landscape and present an outlook on the key scientific questions and promising application directions. We hope this review will benefit the disciplinary research paradigm across chemistry, nanotechnology, and biology, providing valuable inspiration for future research in nanomedicine.

         <title>Interwoven Porous ZIF Polyhedra Threaded with Silver Thiolate Nanowires for Ultrasensitive SERS Detection of Chlorotoluene Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rationally designed SERS substrate of (Ag02AgIMpy)n@h&#8208;ZIF is fabricated through the integration of structure&#8208;defined Ag&#8208;Mpy into a porous ZIF framework. The inherent porosity of ZIF, along with the incorporation of Mpy signal molecules, facilitate the effective enrichment of target molecules, positioning them in close vicinity to the electromagnetic enhancement zones of the Ag0 substrates. Remarkably, the (Ag02AgIMpy)n@h&#8208;ZIF substrate demonstrates SERS recognition capabilities for monochlorotoluene isomers that are difficult to distinguish non&#8208;destructively using alternative techniques.








Abstract
The identification of isomeric organic compounds poses a significant challenge due to their structurally and chemically analogous features. This research introduces an innovative methodology for the detection of chlorotoluene isomers through the utilization of Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS). The approach utilizes an exceptionally efficient SERS substrate, namely (Ag02AgIMpy)n@h&#8208;ZIF (where Mpy denotes p&#8208;mercaptopyridine), characterized by its hollow Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks (h&#8208;ZIFs) interwoven with silver thiolate nanowires. The porous channels within h&#8208;ZIFs stably adsorb various chlorotoluene isomers, subsequently exposing them to the electromagnetic field generated by Ag0 species. In addition to coordinating with silver ions, the Mpy component within the silver nanowires functions as a highly stable SERS probe, which improves detection accuracy by serving as an internal standard. This study introduces a novel Ag&#8208;ZIF model as a highly efficient SERS substrate and presents a distinctive methodology for differentiating organic isomers or analogous small molecules.

         <title>Enriching Higher Affinity Aptamers by Addressing the Kinetic Aspect of the DNA Strand&#8208;Displacement Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Capture&#8208;SELEX for ampicillin aptamers led to the dominance of a low&#8208;affinity aptamer, while extending the target&#8208;library incubation time significantly increased the abundance of a high&#8208;affinity aptamer, revealing a previously unrecognized kinetic effect in the DNA strand displacement reaction during SELEX. Kinetic effects were also observed in aptamer selections for adenosine and voriconazole, confirming the generality of this phenomenon.








Abstract
Selection of high affinity aptamers is the basis for aptamer&#8208;related applications. Most aptamer selections prioritize thermodynamic factors such as the target concentration but neglect interaction kinetics. Using ampicillin as a target, aptamer selections were carried out based on the DNA strand&#8208;displacement reaction. A low&#8208;affinity aptamer (Kd&#160;=&#160;12.7&#160;&#181;M) dominated under the typical condition of gravity flow with a short interaction time of 1 to 2&#160;min, whereas a high affinity aptamer (Kd&#160;=&#160;1.8&#160;&#181;M) dominated the library with an additional 10&#160;min incubation. These two aptamers differ only in three positions, and the strand&#8208;displacement kinetics was determined to be responsible for the selection outcomes. Kinetic effects were also observed in aptamer selection for adenosine, highlighting the broad applicability of this finding. Additionally, aptamers for a challenging target voriconazole were successfully enriched by extending incubation time. To reliably obtain thermodynamically best aptamers, a combination of low target concentration and long incubation time is recommended. This work not only yields a high&#8208;affinity and selective aptamer for ampicillin but also highlights the interplay between thermodynamics and kinetics in aptamer selection.

         <title>Versatile and Selective Biomolecule Pulldown with Combinatorial DNA&#8208;Crosslinked Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a programmable smart polymer system for universal, sequence&#8208;selective bioseparation under native conditions. Polymer phase separation is achieved through combinatorial DNA crosslinking, enabling the capture of DNA, RNA, or proteins in a homogeneous solution with high pulldown efficiency and near&#8208;zero background binding. This method reduces biases in ribosomal RNA depletion for RNA&#8208;seq, while offering long&#8208;term stability and cost&#8208;efficiency.








Abstract
Current methods for sequence&#8208;selective biomolecule isolation suffer from high cost, off&#8208;target effects, and limited flexibility. Here, we introduce LASSO (crossLink&#8208;Assisted Sequence&#8208;Selective isOlation), a versatile platform using programmable polymer phase separation to capture biomolecules under native conditions. LASSO relies on combinatorial crosslinker libraries&#8212;diverse mixtures of DNA strands that collectively trigger the formation of highly swollen polymer agglomerates with near&#8208;zero background binding. We demonstrate&#160;&gt;80% pulldown efficiency for diverse targets, including DNA, SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA, and human thrombin. LASSO provides 8&#8211;20x higher binding capacity (4&#160;nmol mg&#8722;1 polymer) than commercial microbeads. In RNA&#8208;seq workflows, LASSO depleted ribosomal RNA with 86% efficiency, while yielding up to 7x fewer off&#8208;target outliers versus state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art magnetic beads and enzyme&#8208;based methods. Thrombin was captured via switchable aptamers with 90% efficiency, and a gentle release mechanism allowed the subsequent isolation of 98% enzymatically active proteins from the polymer. LASSO's cost&#8208;effectiveness ($0.96/sample versus $46&#8211;$51 for commercial kits), long&#8208;term stability (7&#160;+&#160;years), simple usage, and modularity position it to advance diagnostics, transcriptomics, and bionanotechnology workflows.

We develop novel strategies for the facile synthesis of anionic phosphasilenes in the forms of both P&#8208;metalation and Si&#8208;metalation. The P&#8208;metalated phosphasilene displays a pronounced &#960;&#8208;bond&#8208;driven reactivity toward robust inert molecules, whereas the Si&#8208;metalated analogue behaves as a silylene equivalent via a retro&#8208;1,2&#8208;silver migration. 








Abstract
Anionic reagents with silicon&#8208;containing double bonds, M(R)Si&#9552;ERn (E&#160;=&#160;main group elements), have garnered significant interest owing to their unique metal&#8208;mediated reactivity and their potential in transferring the Si&#9552;E unit. Within this domain, the intriguing field of Si&#8208;metalated phosphasilenes remains uncharted. Herein, we present a novel strategy for the efficient synthesis of P&#8208;metalated phosphasilenes and their subsequent transformation into Si&#8208;metalated phosphasilenes via a distinctive phosphinosilylene intermediate formed during a metal&#8208;mediated skeletal rearrangement. While P&#8208;metalated phosphasilenes exhibit a pronounced &#960;&#8208;bonding character in the Si&#9552;P linkage, the skeletal rearrangement attenuates both the Si&#9552;P and Si&#9472;M bonds in the resulting Si&#8208;metalated phosphasilenes, rendering them effective silylene equivalents. Moreover, formal transmetallation of Si&#8208;metalated phosphasilene with dimetal carbonyl complexes provides access to a broader array of Si&#8208;metalated analogues. This transmetallation proceeds through the phosphinosilylene intermediate, as evidenced by the isolation of a silylene&#8211;dimanganese complex, thereby revealing an uncharted mechanistic manifold for this class of transformations.

         <title>Bis(2&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;thienyl)Ketone as Oxygen Tolerant Sensitizer for Conventional Radical Photopolymerization</title>

Bis(2&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;thienyl)ketones operate as sensitizer in multi&#8208;component photoinitiating systems using either diaryl iodonium cation or amino benzoates as coinitiators to initiate conventional radical polymerization following either oxidative or reduction photoinduced electron transfer protocol, respectively. These systems result in formation of crosslinked polymers even under aerobic conditions. A 395&#160;nm emitting LED operated as exposure source.








Abstract
Bis(2&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;thienyl)ketones (TKs) operated as effective sensitizer in a multi&#8208;component photoinitiating system for conventional radical photopolymerization. The distinct amino pattern (morpholino 1&#160;versus diaryl moiety 2) followed an oxidative photoinduced electron transfer (PET) mechanism with the iodonium salt C1 and the sulfonium cation C2. 2 performed well under air upon UV&#8208;LED exposure at 395&#160;nm. The TKs mostly reacted from the triplet state (T1) with either C1 or C2 resulting in a cation radical with certain instability. This changes considering the radical anion studied by spectroelectrochemistry confirmed by reversibility. Electrochemical measurements and transient absorption experiments disfavor from a thermodynamic point of view a reductive mechanism of the T1 with C3. Long&#8208;lived charge separated states discuss a new paradigm as a further alternative to form reactive intermediates even with C3. 1O2 generation by 3TK* operated as additional pathway to form the initiating &#8764;N&#9472;CH2&#8226; radical of C3. The higher efficiency of photoinduced electron transfer (PET) with C1 explained the higher network density of the crosslinked material. The subsequent [4+2] cycloaddition of 1O2 to the thiophene moiety led to a mass increase of 32 mz of either 1 or 2, which led to depletion of inhibiting 3O2. This additionally explains the unexpected, good oxygen tolerance. Furthermore, TK 2a showed no significant cytotoxic response explaining its future potential for biocompatible applications.

         <title>Creep Resistant and Reprocessable Polyamide Networks Based on Reversible Lactone Ring&#8208;Opening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the reversible ring&#8208;opening reaction of &#947;&#8208;lactones with primary amines was used to obtain dynamic covalent polyamide networks combining excellent reprocessability and creep resistance. This behavior was facilitated by neighboring group participation of the mildly nucleophilic &#947;&#8208;hydroxyl moiety present after amide formation.








Abstract
Amides are robust chemical linkages of interest in the field of dynamic covalent polymer networks (DCPNs), but their activation towards dynamic exchange remains an outstanding challenge. Herein, we introduce &#947;&#8208;hydroxy amides as a versatile motif for the design of creep resistant, yet fully reprocessable crosslinked polyamide&#8208;based materials. This was achieved by the reversible ring&#8208;opening of &#947;&#8208;lactones with primary amines. Small molecule kinetic studies showed that temperatures exceeding 120&#160;&#176;C are required for the ring&#8208;closure to occur at a significant rate. Thus, efficient exchange of the &#947;&#8208;hydroxy amide bonds was expected upon heating, while essentially non&#8208;dynamic covalent amide bonds should prevail at lower temperatures. &#947;&#8208;Hydroxy amides were then introduced into DCPNs, for which a newly prepared bifunctional &#947;&#8208;lactone monomer was cured with amine hardeners. A marked thermal response was observed in the rheological behavior, while creep resistance comparable to that of a non&#8208;dynamic epoxy&#8208;amine network was maintained up to 120&#160;&#176;C. Finally, we could also demonstrate the thermal resilience of &#947;&#8208;hydroxy amides after multiple compression molding cycles for a material with a glass transition temperature above 80&#160;&#176;C. Consequently, we expect that this simple chemistry platform has high potential for application in reprocessable thermoset materials.

B&#8211;N&#8208;substituted organic photosensitizers enable efficient triplet energy transfer under visible light, outperforming traditional sensitizers in challenging EnT reactions with high&#8208;energy substrates.








Abstract
We report a new class of rationally designed organic photosensitizers based on boron&#8211;nitrogen&#8208;substituted scaffolds, capable of mediating challenging triplet energy transfer (EnT) reactions under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Guided by DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations, we modulated the twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) character of the excited state through strategic substitution on the carbazole&#8211;borane framework, allowing fine&#8208;tuning of both absorption and triplet energy levels (ET&#160;=&#160;63&#8211;70&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1). The most effective catalyst outperformed traditional Ir&#8208; and xanthone&#8208;based sensitizers across benchmark EnT reactions, including E/Z isomerizations, [2&#160;+&#160;2] photocycloadditions, and [1,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement. This B&#8211;N system enables the sensitization of coumarin&#8208;related substrates with ET&#160;&#8805;&#160;65&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1, which was previously inaccessible to fully organic EnT photocatalysts. These results establish a new design principle for modular, high&#8208;energy triplet sensitizers based on organic aminoborane scaffolds.

The self&#8208;adaptive low&#8208;valent indium single atoms serve as solid&#8208;state buffering sites, inducing a potential&#8208;dependent adsorption behavior of the nitrate ion over that of the sulfate ion as a supporting oxoanion in the electric double layer of Cu&#8208;based catalysts, achieving near&#8208;unity selectivity toward the NH3 product in neutral media.








Abstract
Microenvironment modulation, involving the selective adsorption of ions and the engineering of hydrogen radicals, is critical for the neutral electrochemical reduction of nitrate to ammonia at high current densities. In this work, self&#8208;adaptive low&#8208;valent indium single atoms SAs decorated copper&#8208;based nanosheets were investigated as a prototype. The catalyst exhibits a maximum ammonia Faradaic efficiency (FENH3) of 99.36% and a high NH3 yield rate of 29.02&#160;mg h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 in neutral electrolyte. In&#8208;depth experiments and theoretical calculations suggest that the indium SAs optimize the local electronic distribution of the derived Cu matrix through strong p&#8208;d orbital couplings, with the electron&#8208;relay effect, thereby enhancing electron transfer and regulating the supply of hydrogen radicals to accelerate the hydrogenation process. Furthermore, in situ Raman results and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the indium SAs can act as solid&#8208;state buffering sites by inducing a potential&#8208;dependent adsorption behavior of NO3&#8722; over SO42&#8722; as a supporting oxoanion in the electric double layer, consequently maintaining high reaction activity and selectivity. Herein, the as&#8208;designed electrode operates stably at 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 150&#160;h in a bipolar membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer with a FENH3 of &#8764;83%, indicating promising practical applications.

         <title>Novel Sulfonium Reagents for the Modular Synthesis of Spiro[2.3]Hexanes and Heteroatom&#8208;Containing Analogues: Synthesis, Application, and Evaluation as Bioisosteres</title>

Strained spirocyclic spiro[2.3]hexane and its heteroatom&#8208;containing derivatives, including previously underrepresented 5&#8208;oxa&#8208;1&#8208;azaspiro[2.3]hexanes and 1,5&#8208;diazaspiro[2.3]hexanes, were synthesized via a modular approach of insertion of cyclobutane&#8208;, oxetane&#8208;, and azetidine&#8208;containing sulfonium reagents into alkenes, carbonyls and imines. A combined in silico unsupervised learning and predictive analytics approach was used to investigate their potential as bioisosteres and our hypothesis was validated through in vitro studies.








Abstract
Molecular scaffolds with a high fraction of sp3&#8208;hybridized centers have attracted considerable attention in medicinal chemistry as bioisosteres for a wide range of aromatic and nonstrained heterocycles. In particular, strained spiro&#8208;heterocycles have garnered popularity for this purpose, although access to spiro[2.3]hexane analogues is underrepresented. We herein report modular access to nine different spiro[2.3]hexane analogues, including previously underdeveloped 5&#8208;oxa&#8208;1&#8208;azaspiro[2.3]hexane and 1,5&#8208;diazaspiro[2.3]hexane motifs. Our synthetic approach leverages novel cyclobutane&#8208;, oxetane&#8208;, and azetidine&#8208;substituted sulfonium salts, which can undergo Johnson&#8211;Corey&#8211;Chaykovsky type reactions with alkenes, carbonyls and imines to provide access to the desired spiro[2.3]hexanes. Here, we also report the first comprehensive computational and predictive in silico evaluation of their bioisosteric potential, with validation provided by in vitro experiments.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Release Induced 1,2&#8208;Metallate Rearrangement of Geminal Diborons: Multicomponent 1,5&#8208;Difunctionalization via Ring&#8208;Opening Coupling</title>

         <dc:description>
A multicomponent 1,2&#8208;metallate rearrangement of geminal diborons is developed via strain&#8208;release. This approach enabled allylative and iodinative ring opening of cyclopropanes while simultaneously providing sterically encumbered internal geminal diborons. Mechanistic studies shed light into the role of trans&#8208;orientation of vinyl and boronate groups to facilitate ring opening.








Abstract
1,2&#8208;metallate rearrangement of geminal diboryl alkanes typically requires an &#945;&#8208;leaving group and results in monofunctionalization at the proximal carbon. We present a strategy to engage non&#8208;terminal geminal diborons in 1,2&#8208;boronate shift via ring&#8208;opening of strained vinyl cyclopropyl diborons (VCPDBs). This multicomponent reaction enabled proximal and remote 1,5&#8208;difunctionalization yielding densely functionalized homoallylic diboryl alkanes featuring allylic halide or branched 1,5&#8208;diene motifs which are components of bioactive natural products. The VCPDB reaction displayed polarity inversion relative to majority of the previous VCP ring&#8208;opening reactions. The protocol showed broad substrate scope, providing alkenyl products with high E&#8208;stereoselectivity, and their downstream synthetic utility was also demonstrated. Employing a chiral ligand in the allylation preserved the reaction efficiency while indicating enantioenrichment in the ring&#8208;opening coupling. 11B NMR studies indicated the involvement of &#8220;ate&#8208;complex&#8221; and the role of trans&#8208;orientation of vinyl and boronate groups to facilitate ring opening. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first examples of strain&#8208;release induced 1,2&#8208;metallate rearrangement on geminal diborons and Ir catalyzed multicomponent allylation of organoborons beyond 1,2 or 1,3&#8208;addition.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights of Bipolar Redox Cathodes for Organic Rechargeable Batteries: LUMO Anti&#8210;Bonding Contributions</title>

         <dc:description>
A rational design framework for bipolar organic cathodes is established by integrating p&#8210;type pendants (&#8210;NH2, &#8210;OH, &#8210;SH) with carbonyl backbones and elucidating their structure&#8210;property relationships. Thermodynamic and electronic analyses clarify mechanistic origins of bipolar redox activity, while PF6&#8208;induced decomposition is confirmed to form only HF&#8208;coordinated adducts beyond standard operating voltage window, posing no performance penalty.








Abstract
The search for sustainable organic cathode materials has been constrained by intrinsically low redox potentials and limited understanding of p&#8210;type redox chemistry. In this study, we establish a rational design framework for bipolar cathodes by combining p&#8210;type functionalities (&#8210;NH2, &#8210;OH, &#8210;SH) with carbonyl backbones and elucidating their structure&#8210;property relationships using the first&#8208;principles calculations. We find that redox potentials and resultant discharging behaviors are governed by the interplay between backbone electron deficiency, p&#8210;type pendant group identity, and solvation stability, in conjunction with charging energy and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) anti&#8208;bonding contributions as principal electronic descriptors. While PF6 anion&#8208;induced decomposition occurs through backbone fluorination and/or locally HF&#8208;coordinated bipolar compound generation depending on p&#8210;type functionality, its onset beyond the electrochemical voltage window allows full utilization of both n&#8210;type and p&#8210;type mechanisms. This design strategy enables theoretical charge capacities and energy densities that surpass those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art inorganic and organic cathodes. These insights highlight the underexplored role of p&#8210;type functionalities and provide molecular&#8210;level guidelines for engineering next&#8210;generation, high&#8210;performance organic cathodes.

A versatile synthetic approach employing customised C&#8208;glycosyl &#945;&#8208;amino acids enables the preparation of C&#8208;glycopeptides with precise spatial incorporation of non&#8208;canonical residues. NMR analyses reveal that the identity, number, and distribution of C&#8208;glycosyl units govern peptide conformations via intramolecular hydrogen bonding between backbone amides and carbohydrate side chains.








Abstract
C&#8208;glycosylation is a well&#8208;established strategy for improving the pharmacokinetic properties of peptides; however, the influence of chiral C&#8208;glycosyl amino acid incorporation on peptide conformation remains insufficiently explored. Most existing synthetic approaches restrict C&#8208;glycosyl amino acid placement to the N&#8208;terminus, C&#8208;terminus, or specific residues containing pre&#8208;installed reactive groups. Here, we present a more versatile strategy based on the design and synthesis of customized C&#8208;glycosyl amino acids. Four variants bearing protected galactopyranose, ribofuranose, sorbofuranose, or allofuranose side chains were synthesized and incorporated into peptides using a solid&#8208;phase methodology, enabling substitution at diverse sequence positions. Detailed NMR analyses revealed that each C&#8208;glycosyl &#945;&#8208;amino acid promotes distinct conformational preferences, primarily stabilized by hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks between backbone amides and carbohydrate side chains. These findings uncover conformational information encoded within four non&#8208;canonical C&#8208;glycosyl &#945;&#8208;amino acids, offering new molecular tools for catalysis, materials development and drug discovery.

         <title>Synthesis of Perdeuterated Pentane and THF Under Mild Conditions by Silica&#8208;Supported Ta/M (M&#160;=&#160;Co, Ir) Heterobimetallic Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silica&#8208;supported Ta/Co heterobimetallic catalyst prepared by surface organometallic chemistry shows excellent room&#8208;temperature activity in pentane perdeuteration, outperforming Ta and Ta/Ir systems. By combining the complementary reactivity of the Ta/Co and Ta/Ir catalysts, a mild, solvent&#8208;free tandem hydrogen isotope exchange/deuterogenation strategy was further developed for the efficient synthesis of high&#8208;purity and high&#8208;value THF&#8208;d8.








Abstract
The catalytic hydrogen&#8208;isotope exchange (HIE) of unactivated C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds remains a formidable challenge, relevant for the synthesis of high&#8208;purity high&#8208;value perdeuterated NMR solvents such as pentane or tetrahydrofuran. Existing methods primarily rely on precious metal&#8208;based catalysts (eg. Ir, Ru) under homogeneous conditions. In pursuit of more sustainable alternatives, we report the synthesis of the heterobimetallic complex [Ta(CH2tBu)2(&#956;&#8208;CHtBu)2CoCp*], 1, which is used for the preparation of a novel silica&#8208;supported tantalum&#8211;cobalt heterobimetallic catalyst through Surface OrganoMetallic Chemistry (SOMC). This Ta/Co material demonstrated exceptional catalytic efficiency in perdeuterating pentane under mild conditions (room temperature, &lt;&#160;1&#160;bar D2, 1 mol% cat.), outperforming both the Ta monometallic and the noble&#8208;metal based Ta/Ir heterobimetallic analogues. Furthermore, we took profit of the complementary arene HIE and deuterogenation activities of the Ta/M (M&#160;=&#160;Ir, Co) catalysts to develop a tandem catalytic synthetic strategy for the efficient preparation of perdeuterated tetrahydrofuran from furan, achieving up to 94% total deuterium incorporation. This novel catalytic system offers several key advantages such as a) mild reaction conditions, b) atom&#8208;efficient use of D2 as the deuterium source, and c) simplified handling, allowing for the recovery of pure deuterated solvent via simple condensation, not hampered by the use of solvents nor additives.

         <title>All&#8208;Scale Structural Optimization of Resiliently Crystalline Na&#8211;Ce&#8211;Sn&#8211;S Chalcogel for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na&#8211;Ce&#8211;Sn&#8211;S chalcogel model overcomes the challenge of achieving long&#8208;range order in chalcogels by using cerium ions to template a robust, 2D crystalline framework. The stoichiometric tuning of cerium provides hierarchical, all&#8208;scale control over this architecture, which arises from the coordination transformation of thiostannate clusters. The resulting robust and tunable crystalline framework is optimized for the oxygen evolution reaction, establishing a new class of chalcogels with high catalytic efficiency.








Abstract
The metal cation linker in metathesis&#8208;derived chalcogels critically governs structural evolution, porosity, and resultant physicochemical properties. However, most studies have emphasized atomic&#8208;scale functionality of metal linker within chalcogel network, with limited attention to local structural transformation and even long&#8208;range ordering. This work demonstrates the unprecedented role of cerium ions in directing the formation of a sustainable 2D crystalline Ce&#8211;Sn&#8211;S (CTS) chalcogel. The crystalline framework arises from coordination transformation of SnS4 tetrahedra within Sn2S6 dimers into distorted Sn3S4 broken&#8208;cube clusters, yielding a [Sn3S7]n2n&#8722; layered geometry. Cerium oxidation states, particularly Ce3+ enrichment, further stabilize the crystalline network via a templating effect and enhance electrocatalytic activity. The optimized CTS&#8208;5 chalcogel exhibits superior oxygen evolution reaction performance, including a low overpotential of 300&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, the lowest Tafel slope of 80&#160;mV dec&#8722;1, and stable operation for 50&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The crystalline CTS chalcogel represents a new class of aerogel materials, where robust 2D crystallinity persists even under high cation loading, enabling functional tunability without compromising network integrity.

         <title>Reversible Na+/I&#8722; Dual&#8208;Ion Chemistry by Electrolyte Engineering Enables High&#8208;Rate and Long&#8208;Lifespan Energy Storage Device</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible Na+/I&#8208;dual&#8208;ion chemistry enables a high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;lifespan energy storage device. The solvation engineering strategy was performed through the introduction of sodium trifluoromethanesulfonate (NaOTf), reducing the desolvation energy barrier by approximately 40%. Therefore, the Na&#8208;I2 batteries achieve a high capacity of 105 mAh g&#8722;1 for 20,000 cycles with 79.2% capacity retention at the current density of 5 A g&#8722;1. 








Abstract
Aqueous battery energy storage systems have driven extensive attention owing to safety, low&#8208;cost, and environmental friendliness. However, the dendrite growth, poor reversibility, and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) hinder their commercial utilization. To address these issues, we first developed a dual&#8208;ion sodium&#8208;iodine (Na&#8208;I2) battery system, incorporating a carbon&#8208;coated Fe0.5Ti2(PO4)3 anode coupled with an activated carbon cathode. This system demonstrates dendrite&#8208;free behavior, superior durability, and excellent reversibility. Impressively, a Na&#8208;ion solvation engineering strategy was performed through electrolyte optimization of sodium trifluoromethanesulfonate (NaOTf), in which OTf&#8722; replaces the H2O in Na+ solvation sheath. Breaking the hydrogen&#8208;bond network of H2O molecules and reducing the desolvation energy barrier by approximately 40% is confirmed by MD simulations, as well as enhancing ionic conductivity and charge transfer kinetics. Accordingly, the Na&#8208;I2 batteries achieve a high capacity of 105 mAh g&#8722;1 for 20,000 cycles with 79.2% capacity retention at 5 A g&#8722;1. Pouch cells with a capacity of 56 mAh achieve a long cycling lifespan up to 500 cycles with the retention of 92.3% at the current of 50&#160;mA. Extended to 1.1 Ah, it also presents outstanding charging&#8211;discharging performance. This work offers a transformative framework for the development of high&#8208;performance aqueous Na&#8208;I2 batteries.

         <title>Molecular Traffic Control: Fast Mg2+ Transport via Carbonyl&#8208;Induced Ion&#8208;Dipole Interactions in Covalent Organic Framework Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a carbonyl&#8208;mediated &#8220;Molecular Traffic Control&#8221; system within Tp&#8208;DAAQ COF channels, which accelerates Mg2+ transport via ion&#8208;dipole interactions that promote dissociation, desolvation, and rapid (001) migration. This intrinsic kinetic enhancement yields a high&#8208;capacity cathode with remarkable rate capability and stability. Our finding that organic active sites can be engineered to orchestrate ion flow establishes a new paradigm for designing high&#8208;power energy storage materials.








Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) have garnered significant attention due to their high energy density, abundant resources, and inherent safety. However, developing cathode materials with both high specific capacity and excellent kinetic performance remains a significant challenge. In this study, two carbonyl&#8208;functionalized covalent organic frameworks (COFs), namely Tp&#8208;DAAQ COF and Tp&#8208;DAA COF, were successfully synthesized via a molecular engineering strategy. Among them, the Tp&#8208;DAAQ COF, with a higher density of carbonyl sites, exhibits superior performance in terms of specific capacity and rate capability. Mechanistic investigations revealed that reversible storage of Mg2+ is achieved through the enolization reaction of carbonyl groups. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations and theoretical calculations indicated that the carbonyl oxygen acts as a negatively charged center, facilitating Mg2+ dissociation via ion&#8208;dipole interactions and modulating the ion distribution within the COF channels. This significantly reduces the diffusion energy barrier for Mg2+ within the porous framework. As a result, the Tp&#8208;DAAQ COF cathode exhibits not only a high ion diffusion rate but also exceptional cycling stability, maintaining 72% capacity retention over 4000 cycles at 1000&#160;mA g&#8722;1. This work highlights carbonyl&#8208;rich COFs potential as RMBs cathode, elucidates their high kinetics mechanism, and provides insights into RMBs advanced organic cathode structural design.

         <title>The Zintl&#8211;Klemm Concept in the Amorphous State: A Case Study of Na&#8211;P Battery Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The long&#8208;established Zintl&#8211;Klemm concept can be applied to amorphous materials just as well &#8212; as is shown here for disordered Na&#8211;P phases that are relevant for sodium&#8208;ion battery anodes. Machine&#8208;learning&#8208;driven, quantum&#8208;mechanically accurate simulations yiel insights into structure and bonding, and unlock the atomistic modeling of structural changes during battery operation.








Abstract
The Zintl&#8211;Klemm concept has long been used to explain and predict the bonding, and thereby the structures, of crystalline solid&#8208;state materials. We apply this concept to the amorphous state, examining as an example the diverse disordered Na&#8211;P phases that can form in sodium&#8208;ion battery anodes. Using first&#8208;principles computations combined with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art machine&#8208;learning methods, we provide atomic&#8208;scale insights into the structures and energetics of amorphous Na&#8211;P phases. We showcase the applicability of the Zintl&#8211;Klemm rules in the amorphous state and discuss implications for future&#160;work.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Layered Platinum&#8208;Based Intermetallic with Phosphorus Pillar Nanoengineering Enables pH&#8208;Universal Hydrogen Oxidation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt5GaP/Pt5InP intermetallics feature layered architectures with P&#8208;pillared interlayer tunnels, enabling size&#8208;selective H2 transport/CO blocking. They exhibit exceptional full&#8208;pH HOR activity and CO tolerance, with Pt5InP showing 13.9/11.5&#8208;fold higher mass activity than Pt/C in acid/alkaline media. This pillar nanoengineering strategy is generalized for Pt&#8208;based layered electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Layered materials boost hydrogen energy catalytic efficiency by expanding electrochemically surface area and elevating the intrinsic site activity. However, synthesizing atomically layered platinum intermetallic catalysts remains challenging due to platinum&#8217;s bulk crystallization tendency. Herein, we first prepare Pt5GaP and Pt5InP nanoparticles with self&#8208;supported interlayer tunnels via pillar nanoengineering, featuring Pt5X (X = Ga/In) tri&#8208;layers alternating with &#8220;P pillars&#8221;. The pillar effect enables selective H2 transport while blocking CO, endowing superior full&#8208;pH HOR activity and CO tolerance vs. commercial Pt/C. Pt5InP exhibits 13.9&#8208; and 11.5&#8208;fold higher mass activity than Pt/C at pH = 1 and 13 (50 mV overpotential) with exceptional CO resistance. This novel layered compound and generalizable strategy pave the way for atomic&#8208;scale platinum&#8208;based catalysts, offering a tunnel size&#8208;dependent CO&#8208;tolerant approach and expanding small&#8208;molecule catalysis applicability.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Activated Circular Oligonucleotides for Spatiotemporal Control of Gene Silencing in Mice</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
NIR light&#8208;activatable circular DNAzyme and ASO have been developed using cyanine&#8208;scaffolded NIR linkers, enabling spatiotemporal control of gene silencing in cells and in vivo. Our data demonstrated that NIR&#8208;activated circular DNAzymes specifically suppressed EGR1 expression and inhibited tumor growth in a tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model, highlighting their potential for safe and on&#8208;demand gene therapy.








Abstract
Oligonucleotide therapeutics hold great promise for gene regulation but face challenges in achieving spatiotemporal control of their functions in vivo. In this study we developed a novel design of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;activatable circular oligonucleotide platform that incorporates a cyanine&#8208;scaffolded NIR photocleavable linker. These engineered circular DNAs, including DNAzymes and antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) remain functionally inactive until NIR light irradiation triggers the linker cleavage and activates their functions, thereby enabling spatiotemporal control of gene silencing in cells and in vivo. Live cell studies demonstrated that circular DNAzymes and ASOs maintained minimal basal activity but could be efficiently activated by NIR light to achieve robust gene silencing of both exogenous and endogenous mRNAs. In vivo studies showed that lipid nanoparticle&#8208;delivered circular DNAzymes targeting the early growth response protein 1 (EGR1) mRNA achieved localized tumor suppression upon NIR irradiation, while exhibiting minimal gene silencing activity in normal organs. Our work establishes a versatile and effective platform for the spatiotemporal control of oligonucleotide functions in vivo, providing a powerful tool for the basic study of gene function and highlighting their potential in the development of safe and on&#8208;demand gene therapeutics.

         <title>Reconfiguring Ionomers in Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell Catalyst Layer to Promote Multi&#8208;Species Transport and Durability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing porous graphene&#8208;based nanosheet@Nafion composite ionomers into proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), the structure of Nafion is reconfigured from a lamellar configuration to microchannels with ionic domains. This improves the rapid transfer of protons and water while reducing the resistance to oxygen transfer, improving output power at high voltages, and increasing durability through better water management.








Abstract
In proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), ionomers in the catalyst layer tend to align lamellar to the catalyst surface, impeding the formation of continuous ionic domains essential for efficient proton transport.

&lt;p&gt;By introducing porous graphene-based nanosheet@Nafion composite ionomers into proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), the structure of Nafion is reconfigured from a lamellar configuration to microchannels with ionic domains. This improves the rapid transfer of protons and water while reducing the resistance to oxygen transfer, improving output power at high voltages, and increasing durability through better water management.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), ionomers in the catalyst layer tend to align lamellar to the catalyst surface, impeding the formation of continuous ionic domains essential for efficient proton transport. This alignment also obstructs oxygen diffusion to the catalyst-liquid-gas three-phase boundary (TPB), which critically limits the PEMFC's power density. Here, we introduce porous graphene-based nanosheet@Nafion composite ionomers that reconfigure ion transport domains and gas channels at the nanoscale within the catalyst layer. These composite ionomers dramatically enhance proton transport (5.0-fold) and oxygen diffusion (3.3-fold), increasing rated power density by 1.70 times and peak power density by 1.48 times compared to Nafion-based fuel cells. Furthermore, they demonstrate significant durability improvements during accelerated stress tests. This strategy provides an effective approach to optimizing microstructures and constructing efficient multi-species transport pathways at the TPB, highlighting their potential for maximizing the performance of advanced high-activity electrocatalytic materials in PEMFCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Air Capture and Photoconversion of CO2 to Ethylene by Defect&#8208;Tailored Cu3&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of defect&#8208;tailored Cu3&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Cu3&#8208;MOFs) featuring coordinatively unsaturated Cu active sites were constructed for simultaneous direct air capture and photoreduction of CO2 to ethylene, offering fundamental insights for developing advanced materials in direct air&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.








Abstract
The development of efficient direct air capture (DAC) systems coupled with photocatalytic CO2 conversion is still an appealing challenge. Here, we engineered a series of defective Cu3&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Cu3&#8208;MOFs) for integrated atmospheric CO2 capture and in situ photoreduction. The defective Cu3&#8208;MOFs were constructed through selective removal of coordinated CO32&#8722; from pristine MOFs with HCl etching, generating unsaturated Cu active sites for CO2 harvesting, and the Cu3&#8208;MOFs demonstrated enhanced CO2 capture kinetics and capacity that compared to their pristine counterpart. Remarkably, the captured CO2 could be directly photoreduced to C2H4 with an optimal production rate of 18.25&#160;&#181;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 without additional photosensitizer or sacrificial agent. The experimental and theoretical results revealed that the defective sites not only facilitated CO2 adsorption but also promoted C&#8211;C coupling of *CO intermediates, thereby enhancing C2H4 production. This work provides deep insights for designing advanced materials toward direct air&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.

         <title>Regulating *H Dynamics via Photoinduced Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;Lattice Oxygen Frustrated Lewis Pairs for Superior CO2 Photoreduction</title>

Construction of photoinduced oxygen vacancy&#8211;lattice oxygen frustrated Lewis pairs (Vo&#8208;OL FLPs) on the metal oxide atomic layers, coupled with employing BA as alternative *H source, to concurrently facilitate *H generation and subsequent transfer from BA to CO2, while suppressing competitive *H reduction to H2, thereby enabling superior CO2 photoreduction.








Abstract
Herein, we construct photoinduced oxygen vacancy&#8208;lattice oxygen frustrated Lewis pairs (Vo&#8208;OL FLPs) on metal oxide atomic layers, coupled with employing benzyl alcohol (BA) as an alternative *H source, to concurrently promote *H production and transfer, enabling efficient CO2 photoreduction. Taking the Vo&#8208;Bi2WO6 atomic layers as examples, in situ solid&#8208;state electron paramagnetic resonance and in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy elucidate photoinduced FLPs, composed of Vo and OL, which respectively trap photogenerated electrons and holes to activate CO2 and facilitate BA dehydrogenation. In situ Kelvin probe force microscopy and density of states calculations indicate Vo suppresses the electron&#8208;hole recombination by creating defect levels. Importantly, in situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectra, isotopic&#8208;labeling experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrate the Vo&#8208;OL FLPs mediate efficient *H transfer from BA to CO2, suppressing competitive *H reduction to H2. In situ electron paramagnetic resonance spectra also disclose BA oxidation proceeds via a more kinetically favorable pathway for *H production than H2O oxidation. Benefiting from the synergistic enhancement in *H production and transfer, the photocatalyst achieves an impressive CO2 conversion rate of 3667.1&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with excellent 240 h stability, surpassing previously reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art systems. This work offers atomic&#8208;level insights for designing active sites to optimize *H dynamics.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Polarization in Rigid/Soft Layered Oxide Catalyst Regulates Key Intermediates for Efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Formate Conversion</title>

         <dc:description>
The rigid&#8208;flexible layered CuInAlO4 comprises a rigid Al&#8211;O framework and soft Cu&#8211;O units. Unpaired electrons in Cu dz2 orbitals yield spin polarization, transferring to In3+ via 3d(Cu)&#8722;2p(O)&#8722;5s/5p(In) superexchange. Enhanced spin polarization promotes metal&#8722;*OCHO spin&#8208;orbit coupling, forming an In&#8211;O&#8211;CH&#8211;O&#8211;Cu bridge to boost formate efficiency. Al&#8211;O stabilizes metal&#8208;oxygen bonds, inhibits oxygen dissolution, and accelerates kinetics via spin&#8208;polarized charge transfer.








Abstract
Precise control of metal oxidation states is pivotal in regulating the adsorption energetics of *OCHO intermediate during CO2 electroreduction. However, the stabilization of oxidation states to enable effective intermediate adsorption&#8211;desorption behavior remains a critical challenge for enhancing formate yield. Herein, we synthesize a rigid/soft layered oxides (CuInAlO4) with rigid Al&#8211;O framework and soft Cu&#8211;O active units. Spin&#8208;polarized electrons derived from the unpaired electrons in the dz2 orbital of CuO5 units transfer to the empty 5s/5p orbitals of In3&#8314; via the superexchange interaction of 3d(Cu)&#160;&#8722;&#160;2p(O)&#160;&#8722;&#160;5s/5p(In). The enhanced spin polarization promotes spin&#8208;orbit coupling between metal sites (Cu, In) and *OCHO intermediates (O), forming In&#9472;*O&#9472;CH&#9472;O*&#9472;Cu electronic bridge and greatly improving the formation efficiency of formate. CuInAlO4 catalyst achieves exceptional formate selectivity (faradaic efficiency of 95% at 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, energy efficiency of 80.3%, overpotential of 180&#160;mV), outperforming conventional In&#9472;O*&#9472;CH&#9472;O*&#9472;In pathways by reducing the *OCHO&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH energy barrier by 1.31&#160;eV. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the rigid AlO5 units stabilize metal&#8208;oxygen bonds, preventing oxygen dissolution, while accelerating formate production kinetics through spin&#8208;polarized charge transfer.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Induced Size&#8208;Focusing Synthesis of High&#8208;Quality Colloidal Quantum Dots</title>

We present a laser&#8208;assisted atom&#8208;by&#8208;atom photoetching process via the activation&#8211;coordination coupling mechanism, which enables the on&#8208;demand synthesis of colloidal CdSe quantum dots thanks to the laser wavelength&#8208;dependent size&#8208;focusing effect. By studying the underlying reaction thermodynamics and kinetics using in situ and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopies, we show an atomic&#8208;level view on such exciton&#8208;involved photochemical reactions, offering a guideline for the laser&#8208;assisted retrosynthesis of high&#8208;quality quantum&#8208;confined materials.








Abstract
Laser&#8208;assisted chemical synthesis has emerged as a promising toolkit for producing unconventional nanomaterials otherwise not readily accessible. However, it remains challenging for the high&#8208;precision laser&#8208;assisted photoetching of colloidal quantum dots (QDs). Here, we report a laser&#8208;assisted atom&#8208;by&#8208;atom photoetching process that post&#8208;synthetically enables the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art colloidal CdSe QDs. By deciphering the surface chemistry and ultrafast excitonic dynamics, we provide an atomic&#8208;level activation&#8211;coordination coupling mechanism in such exciton&#8208;involved photochemical reactions. In situ spectroscopies further reveal the reaction kinetics as a four&#8208;step size&#8208;focusing process that is highly dependent on the laser wavelength. As such, by modulating the laser wavelength, which dictates the excitonic absorption threshold of final QDs, we are capable of retrosynthetically programming their sizes across a wide quantum&#8208;confined regime, thereby achieving an ultrabroad color gamut. These findings offer a guideline for the laser&#8208;assisted retrosynthesis of high&#8208;quality quantum&#8208;confined materials.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Channel Fluorescence Assays with Supramolecular Host&#8208;Dye Reporter Pairs for Membrane Activity Mapping of Peptides</title>

Membrane&#8208;active peptides (MAPs) such as cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs) and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) can translocate across lipid membranes and create membrane pores. The combination of a dye efflux and a supramolecular tandem membrane assay in a dual&#8208;channel format enables an advanced mechanistic characterization and an exploration of the mechanistic landscape of MAPs enabling their straightforward functional classification.








Abstract
Membrane&#8208;active peptides (MAPs) are a major class of peptides that renders lipid bilayer membranes permeable for hydrophilic compounds. MAPs include cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs) and pore&#8208;forming antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which are believed to be mechanistically related. CPPs render the membrane sufficiently permeable to enable their own translocation, while AMPs create membrane damage and induce cell death. We report herein a fluorescence&#8208;based, dual&#8208;channel assay, which combines a classical dye efflux assay based on self&#8208;quenched carboxyfluorescein (CF) and a recently established supramolecular tandem membrane assay based on the supramolecular host&#8208;dye complex of p&#8208;sulfonatocalix[4]arene (CX4) and lucigenin (LCG). The new assay provides a functional classification of MAPs, which distinguishes between their capability to directly translocate across the vesicle membrane or to induce sufficient membrane permeability to allow dye efflux. The assay was validated with melittin, penetratin, Pep&#8208;1, TP10, and various oligoarginine peptides including the TAT peptide, which confirmed their classification as CPPs or pore&#8208;forming peptides. An advanced variant of the tandem membrane assay also allowed to distinguish between the formation of transient pores and stable equilibrium pores. Overall, the established dual&#8208;channel assay provides a simple and easy to implement method for the advanced mechanistic characterization of MAPs and an exploration of their mechanistic landscape.

         <title>Excited State Modulation of Copper Clusters Realized by Single&#8208;Site Alteration Achieving Near&#8208;Infrared Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)&#8208;active copper clusters (Cu4P, Cu4S, and Cu4Se) were successfully constructed using different anionic templates. Among them, Cu4P exhibits near&#8208;infrared emission, while Cu4S achieves a near&#8208;unity quantum yield. Theoretical calculations reveal that single&#8208;site modulation governs the excited states of these copper clusters, enabling precise manipulation of their photoluminescence properties.








Abstract
Modulating the excited states of coinage metal clusters can effectively improve their photophysical properties, and significant progress has been realized through ligand modification and heterometallic doping. However, precise substitution of individual atoms within the kernel remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we present three copper cluster analogs, namely Cu4S, Cu4Se, and Cu4P, displaying distinct thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), wherein Cu4S and Cu4Se display yellow luminescence with QYs of 99.2% and 89.0% respectively, while Cu4P with the first HP2&#8722; unit in copper clusters exhibits near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission with a QY of 22.2%. Theoretical calculations have verified that the energy levels of excited states in copper clusters are modulated by substituting the central coordinating atoms. The spin&#8208;orbit coupling of Cu4P, Cu4S, and Cu4Se, as well as the structural deformation differences between the excited state and the ground state, leads to the different luminescence quantum yields. This study not only reports the first HP2&#8722;&#8208;involved copper cluster but also establishes a platform for investigation on single&#8208;site modulation directed luminescence of copper clusters.

This tool captures transient hemoglobin intermediates and reveals a synergistic pathogenic mechanism for the neurodegenerative protein &#945;&#8208;synuclein.








Abstract
Observing protein structural dynamics directly within the complex cellular milieu is crucial for understanding biology but is hampered by severe matrix interference in mass spectrometry. Here, we introduce the RapiBOX&#8208;IM&#8208;MS platform, which enables time&#8208;resolved analysis of proteins directly in crude lysates and living cells. The device integrates rapid online buffer exchange with pulsed electrophoretic separation at a nano&#8208;electrospray emitter, eliminating matrix suppression and providing sub&#8208;second temporal resolution. Its power is demonstrated by capturing transient, asymmetric intermediates in hemoglobin refolding and visualizing the lobe&#8208;specific calcium binding dynamics of in&#8208;cell calmodulin. Most significantly, we applied the platform to the neurodegenerative protein alpha&#8208;synuclein, revealing a synergistic pathogenic mechanism where initial acid&#8208;induced compaction paradoxically stabilizes the protein against subsequent thermal stress. This work provides a powerful new tool for dissecting the complex interplay of environmental stressors that trigger protein misfolding and disease.

         <title>Thermodynamic Control of Oxygen Vacancies for Li&#8208;Rich Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pyrometallurgical approach, guided by phase diagrams, provides a method to precisely engineer oxygen vacancies in Li&#8208;rich layered oxides. This strategy establishes a thermodynamic equilibrium to systematically modulate the electronic structure and enhance superstructures. The resulting material exhibits a sixfold increase in initial capacity, offering a generalizable method for advanced cathode material design.








Abstract
Oxygen vacancies (OVs) play a critical role in tuning the properties of oxides, yet their rational control remains challenging. We present a meticulous engineering approach to modulate OVs in lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides (LRLOs), a promising cathode material for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Guided by a Mn&#8208;O2 binary phase diagram, our method achieves accurate and broad tuning of the oxygen partial pressure (PO2) during calcination using a pyrometallurgical CO/CO2 gas pair. Using an ultra&#8208;high&#8208;Mn LRLO model, we quantify a thermodynamic equilibrium between OV concentration and a wide PO2 range (10&#8722;0.7&#8211;10&#8722;10.0 atm). Structural characterizations reveal progressive lattice expansion and an unprecedented enhancement of Li@Mn6 superstructures. An optimized LRLO with 3.8&#160;mol % OVs shows a sixfold improvement in initial discharge capacity (175.9 mAh g&#8722;1) over a reference sample (28.5 mAh g&#8722;1) at 0.1C, achieving a maximum capacity of 287.9 mAh g&#8722;1. Theoretical calculations clarify the role of OVs in modifying the electronic structure of LRLOs, which enables ideal conditioning for facile and reversible anion redox. This study provides a generalizable and facile strategy for OV engineering, which accelerates the commercial viability of LRLOs and offers a new framework for the rational design of other modern materials.

&lt;p&gt;A pyrometallurgical approach, guided by phase diagrams, provides a method to precisely engineer oxygen vacancies in Li-rich layered oxides. This strategy establishes a thermodynamic equilibrium to systematically modulate the electronic structure and enhance superstructures. The resulting material exhibits a sixfold increase in initial capacity, offering a generalizable method for advanced cathode material design.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxygen vacancies (OVs) play a critical role in tuning the properties of oxides, yet their rational control remains challenging. We present a meticulous engineering approach to modulate OVs in lithium-rich layered oxides (LRLOs), a promising cathode material for next-generation lithium-ion batteries. Guided by a Mn-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; binary phase diagram, our method achieves accurate and broad tuning of the oxygen partial pressure (PO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) during calcination using a pyrometallurgical CO/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas pair. Using an ultra-high-Mn LRLO model, we quantify a thermodynamic equilibrium between OV concentration and a wide PO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; range (10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;0.7&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;10.0&lt;/sup&gt; atm). Structural characterizations reveal progressive lattice expansion and an unprecedented enhancement of Li@Mn&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; superstructures. An optimized LRLO with 3.8&#160;mol % OVs shows a sixfold improvement in initial discharge capacity (175.9 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) over a reference sample (28.5 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) at 0.1C, achieving a maximum capacity of 287.9 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific and Regioselective Modification of Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 via Site&#8208;Sculpted DNA Nanorefiners</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;ligand DNA nanodevices constrain human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) orientation and enable site&#8208;specific and regioselective modification via a spatially tunable catalyst. These nanodevices form programmable, site&#8208;sculpted DNA nanorefiners that precisely recognize HER2 and direct multi&#8208;site covalent labeling at spatially defined residues, without perturbing the receptor's intrinsic activity in biological environments.








Abstract
The site&#8208;specific modification of native proteins is essential for regulating their functions and behaviors in biological systems. Such modifications enable advanced studies, but existing artificial methods often lack site selectivity and may perturb the functional integrity of the native proteins. In this study, we have developed a programmable platform based on site&#8208;sculpted DNA nanorefiners (SS&#8208;DNRs), which enables site&#8208;specific modifications of proteins at multiple spatially defined sites through precise molecular recognition. Using the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) as a model system, we demonstrate that this approach could achieve precise site&#8208;specific and regioselective modifications at multiple distinct sites without perturbing its intrinsic activity. By leveraging the programmability and addressability of DNA nanostructures, our platform effectively addresses fundamental challenges related to molecular selectivity and site selectivity that are inherent in chemical, enzymatic, genetic, and affinity&#8208;based modification strategies.

A twofold C&#9472;H cross&#8208;coupling platform that synergistically combines a through&#8208;space 1,n&#8208;M/H shift with photoredox&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) is reported. This mild protocol enables the migratory cross&#8208;coupling of diverse aryl bromides and even less reactive aryl chlorides with the &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds in arenes, alkenes, and ethers, delivering migratory C(sp2)&#8211;H/C(sp3)&#8211;H coupled products with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity.








Abstract
Direct twofold C&#9472;H cross&#8208;coupling between two readily available substrates offers a step&#8208; and atom&#8208;economical alternative to traditional cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Here we report the successful realization of this transformation through a dual catalytic platform that combines two orthogonal C&#9472;H activation modes: nickel&#8208;catalyzed through&#8208;space 1,4&#8208;Ni/H shift and photoredox&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). This synergistic strategy enables regio&#8208; and stereoselective synthesis of substituted alkenes or arenes from aryl bromides (or chlorides) and abundant alkanes with excellent chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivity. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations indicate that HAT is the rate&#8208;limiting step, while radical addition and subsequent reductive elimination collectively govern the observed regioselectivity.

         <title>O2 Activation at an Enzymatic Diiron Site: Bridging Ligand Substitutions Alter Diferric&#8208;(Hydro)peroxo States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituting the bridging carboxylates in diFe sulerythrin shifts the bridging ligand coordination from 1,3&#8208;carboxylate to 1,1&#8208;carboxylate, yielding all three diferrous bridging motifs in one protein. This shortens the Fe&#8211;Fe distance and increases reactivity with O2. O2 exposure triggers Fe rearrangements and traps two distinct diferric (hydro)peroxo intermediates.








Abstract
A variety of non&#8208;heme diiron enzymes employ a conserved 2&#8208;His&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylate motif to coordinate a dinuclear Fe site and activate dioxygen for diverse types of reactions. Two of the carboxylate residues act as bridging ligands between the Fe ions. As the type and coordination geometry of the bridging ligands in the diferrous state are thought to modulate reactivity, they were used to group diiron oxygenases into three structural subclasses. Here, we use the small diiron&#8208;enzyme sulerythrin as a model to demonstrate that replacements of the bridging carboxylate amino acids allow us to decrease the distance between the two Fe ions, change the coordination of the bridging ligands from 1,3&#8208;carboxylates to 1,1&#8208;carboxylates and generate all three structural subclasses of diferrous active sites within the same protein scaffold. In addition to the known classes, we generated a coordination mode containing two 1,1&#8208;carboxylate bridges. The resulting changes in the Fe coordination also alter the nature of the diferric (hydro)peroxo intermediates formed upon reaction with O2. Finally, we show that modulating the carboxylate bridges influences the reactivity of sulerythrin with O2. We establish sulerythrin as a versatile platform to engineer distinct diFe centers by a few exchanges, producing various stable (hydro)peroxo intermediates for further studies.

         <title>Breaking the Trade&#8208;Off Between Activity and Stability in Reverse Water&#8211;Gas Shift Reaction by Forming Highly Active Pt&#9472;O&#9472;Na&#9472;Si Unit Within Silicalite&#8208;1 Catalyst</title>

         <dc:description>
A dual ligand&#8208;protection approach was utilized to regulate the incorporation of Pt and Na within the silicalite&#8208;1. A newly discovered Na&#8208;decorated Pt configuration, designated as Pt&#9472;O&#9472;Na&#9472;Si, was found to significantly elevate the oxidation state of Pt, consequently improving its capacity to facilitate CO desorption. This structure restrains Pt mobility and breaks the trade&#8208;off between activity and stability.








Abstract
The reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction holds significant industrial importance. While directly incorporating alkali metals can enhance the catalytic activity, its contribution to enhancing stability remains rather limited. Encapsulating metal centers within zeolites offers a solution to increase stability, however the fine structure of inner active units is hard to control, bringing negative impact on activity. In this work, a dual ligand&#8208;protected strategy to control the hybridization of Pt and Na species within silicalite&#8208;1 (S1) frameworks is reported, which possesses simultaneously&#8208;improved activity and stability compared with conventional RWGS catalysts. Specifically, the catalyst achieves an impressive turnover frequency (TOF) of 207,156.4 h&#8722;1 with 100% CO selectivity at 350&#160;&#176;C. Moreover, it retains high activity even after undergoing accelerated aging tests at 800&#160;&#176;C. Further mechanistic investigations uncover the formation of a novel Pt&#9472;O&#9472;Na&#9472;Si unit within the confined space of S1, where a skeletal oxygen atom simultaneously coordinates with one Na&#8314; ion and one Pt atom. In this hybrid structure, the Pt centers exhibit a significantly&#8208;raised oxidation state, which was identified as the key factor for the enhancement in RWGS activity: the positive oxidation state facilitates CO desorption, thereby promoting the forward progression of the reaction.

Further mechanistic investigations uncover the formation of a novel Pt&#9472;O&#9472;Na&#9472;Si unit within the confined space of S1, where a skeletal oxygen atom simultaneously coordinates with one Na&#8314; ion and one Pt atom. In this hybrid structure, the Pt centers exhibit a significantly-raised oxidation state, which was identified as the key factor for the enhancement in RWGS activity: the positive oxidation state facilitates CO desorption, thereby promoting the forward progression of the reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Minimalist Molecules Drive Liquid&#8211;Liquid Phase Separation to Modularly Assemble Functional Coacervate Protocells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of phase&#8208;separating molecules with unprecedented ultralow molecular weight was reported. These molecules feature a hydrophobic head and a hydrophilic tail, forming a minimalistic framework that enables precise dissection of the fundamental interactions governing LLPS. This molecular model serves as a versatile synthon for modular construction of task&#8208;specific coacervates that support a series of key prebiotic processes.








Abstract
Although coacervates formed via liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) are widely considered plausible protocell models relevant to the origin of life, identifying minimalist, ultralow&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight molecules (Mw &lt;300&#160;Da) capable of undergoing LLPS remains a major challenge. Here we present a class of synthetic phase&#8208;separating molecules with Mw ranging from 211 to 215&#160;Da&#8211;among the smallest known to drive coacervation. These molecules feature a modular design comprising a hydrophobic head and a hydrophilic tail, forming a minimalistic framework that significantly reduces molecular freedom and enables precise dissection of the fundamental interactions governing LLPS. Our findings reveal that LLPS is governed by a delicate balance between intermolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions and molecular solvation. Furthermore, this molecular architecture serves as a versatile synthon for modularly constructing a range of task&#8208;specific coacervates, including proton&#8208;responsive, redox&#8208;responsive, light&#8208;responsive, and self&#8208;fluorescent variants. These coacervates selectively accumulate diverse guest molecules and act as efficient bio&#8208;crucibles that support key prebiotic processes, such as amino acid&#8208;involved C&#9472;N coupling reactions, chiral catalysis, DNA hybridization, and energy transfer. These results provide both a molecular framework and chemical insights into the minimal requirements for LLPS, while advancing the coacervate toolkit for origins&#8208;of&#8208;life studies and synthetic cell engineering.

         <title>Unveiling Anion&#8208;Cation Interaction of Electrolyte for Long&#8208;Life Ah&#8208;Level Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The anion/cation dehydration shielding force as effective descriptor is proposed for designing high&#8208;performance aqueous electrolytes to achieve the anion&#8208;cation coordination structure, protecting Zn anode from side reaction and dendrite growth, which enables Ah&#8208;level pouch cells to achieve excellent cyclability.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs) are attractive for stationary energy storage due to their low cost and high safety. However, parasitic side reactions and severe Zn dendrites hinder practical implementation. Here, we propose the anion/cation dehydration shielding force as an effective guideline for electrolyte engineering that prioritizes anion&#8208;cation coordination structure. The methodology identifies 2&#8208;ethoxyethanol solvent as optimal components, enhancing Zn2+ diffusion kinetics and suppressing water activity through anion&#8208;dominated coordination chemistry. The preferential reduction of OTF&#8722; enables fluorine&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase formation with high Zn2+ conductivity and excellent mechanical robustness, protecting Zn anode from side reaction and dendrite growth. As a result, the designed electrolyte enables symmetric Zn||Zn pouch cells to achieve 1500&#160;h cycling with a remarkable cumulative capacity of 30&#160;Ah cm&#8722;2 under demanding conditions (20 and 10&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2). More importantly, Ah&#8208;level pouch cells set extremely excellent durability milestones, maintaining 1400 cycles (4.2 months/3000&#160;h operation) while outperforming most reported Zn metal counterparts in comparable capacity ranges.

         <title>Structural Symmetry and Mixed&#8208;anion Engineering in Halopnictides for Extraordinary Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report, for the first time, a synergistic structural symmetry and mixed&#8208;anion engineering strategy in halophosphides, which drives a continuous series of space group transitions in the [Cd4P2][MX4](M = Zn, Mn, Mn/Cd; X = Cl, Br, Cl/I) family and dramatically enhances the second&#8208;harmonic generation response up to 6.6&#160;&#215;&#160;AgGaS2 at 1700&#160;nm.








Abstract
Achieving high nonlinear optical (NLO) coefficients in NLO materials remains a significant challenge. Herein, based on the [Cd4P2] flexible host pore framework, through the structural symmetry and mixed&#8208;anion engineering, different tetrahedral units as the guest are selected as structural directing agents for embedding, resulting in host&#8208;guest halopnictides [Cd4P2][ZnCl4] (space group P21, 1), [Cd4P2][MnCl4] (P212121, 2), [Cd4P2][ZnBr4] (Pna21, 3), [Cd4P2][Mn0.6Cd0.4Br4] (Pna21, 4), and [Cd4P2][ZnCl3I] (Pna21, 5). Notably, we enhance sharply second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) responses (0&#8764;6.6&#160;&#215;&#160;AgGaS2@1700&#160;nm) by synergistically disrupting local symmetry through host framework porosity tuning (54.1% to 63.1%) and constructing polarizable polyhedra via mixed&#8208;anion modulations. Furthermore, millimeter&#8208;sized single&#8208;crystal (3.0&#160;&#215;&#160;5.0&#160;&#215;&#160;8.0 mm3) 3 is successfully obtained, and possesses a strong SHG response (2.5&#160;&#215;&#160;AgGaS2), a high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (3.0&#160;&#215;&#160;AgGaS2@1064&#160;nm), and broad infrared transmittance (2.5&#8211;14.9&#160;&#181;m), indicating the possible promise as a NLO material. This work offers valuable insights for the development of NLO materials through combined structural symmetry and mixed&#8208;anion engineering.

         <title>Possible Peierls Distortion Through Re2 Dimer Formation in the LaNiO2&#8208;Type Nitrides LnReN2 (Ln = Pr, Nd)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the high&#8208;pressure synthesis of two new anion&#8208;vacancy&#8208;ordered perovskite&#8208;related nitrides, PrReN2 and NdReN2, featuring distorted LaNiO2&#8208;type structures. X&#8208;ray and neutron diffraction reveal a structural distortion driven by dimerization of Re&#8208;chains, while electronic structure calculations reveal the simultaneous presence of nitridometallate anions and an intermetallic framework. Magnetic properties were studied with neutron diffraction and magnetization measurements, which reveal an antiferromagnetic ordering of Nd3+ moments in NdReN2 at 15.5 K.








Abstract
Nitride perovskites are a recently opened class of materials with a limited number of stable compounds. Notably, anion&#8208;vacancy&#8208;ordered materials such as LaNiO2&#8208;type nitrides are rare despite useful properties such as superconductivity reported for analogous oxides. Here, we report the preparation of two LnReN2 (Ln&#160;=&#160;Pr, Nd) materials with a distorted LaNiO2&#8208;type structure at high&#8208;pressure, high&#8208;temperature conditions of a large volume press. Powder X&#8208;ray and neutron diffraction show that the orthorhombic distortion (o&#8208;LnReN2) of the LaNiO2&#8208;aristotype structure is caused by buckling of the ReN4/2 layers through Re dimerization.

     alt="Possible Peierls Distortion Through Re2 Dimer Formation in the LaNiO2-Type Nitrides LnReN2 (Ln = Pr, Nd)"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study presents the high-pressure synthesis of two new anion-vacancy-ordered perovskite-related nitrides, PrReN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NdReN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, featuring distorted LaNiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-type structures. X-ray and neutron diffraction reveal a structural distortion driven by dimerization of Re-chains, while electronic structure calculations reveal the simultaneous presence of nitridometallate anions and an intermetallic framework. Magnetic properties were studied with neutron diffraction and magnetization measurements, which reveal an antiferromagnetic ordering of Nd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; moments in NdReN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at 15.5 K.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitride perovskites are a recently opened class of materials with a limited number of stable compounds. Notably, anion-vacancy-ordered materials such as LaNiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-type nitrides are rare despite useful properties such as superconductivity reported for analogous oxides. Here, we report the preparation of two &lt;i&gt;Ln&lt;/i&gt;ReN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Ln&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;Pr, Nd) materials with a distorted LaNiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-type structure at high-pressure, high-temperature conditions of a large volume press. Powder X-ray and neutron diffraction show that the orthorhombic distortion (o-&lt;i&gt;Ln&lt;/i&gt;ReN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) of the LaNiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-aristotype structure is caused by buckling of the ReN&lt;sub&gt;4/2&lt;/sub&gt; layers through Re dimerization. Electronic structure analysis reveals that the o-&lt;i&gt;Ln&lt;/i&gt;ReN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; materials are composed of classic nitridometallate anions and a cationic intermetallic framework. Moreover, the calculations reveal the driving force of the Re dimerization likely to be from an electronic instability related to a Peierls-type distortion. We further characterize the magnetic ground state of both materials with magnetization measurements as well as magnetic neutron scattering uncovering a long-range antiferromagnetic order of Nd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; moments in NdReN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at T&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;15.5&#160;K. The stability of the compounds is investigated by temperature-dependent powder X-ray diffraction showing decomposition of NdReN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at ca. 750 &#176;C.

         <title>Nanoclusters as Deep&#8208;Red Light&#8208;Absorbing Photocatalysts for Laser&#8208; or LED&#8208;Driven Povarov Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold nanoclusters serve as efficient deep&#8208;red photocatalysts to drive the Povarov reaction under laser or LED light, enabling the synthesis of complex tricyclic N&#8208;heterocycles from bioactive scaffolds. Scalable photoreactions and extension to other deep&#8208;red processes establish a versatile, low&#8208;energy platform for cluster&#8208;based photochemistry.








Abstract
Photocatalysis is primarily initiated with ultraviolet/blue light, which has several drawbacks, namely, deficiencies in reaction efficiency, and scalability. Designing catalysts that can absorb low&#8208;energy light offers a promising solution aiming at these drawbacks. In this study, we showed atomically precise gold nanoclusters serve as deep&#8208;red&#8208;absorbing photocatalysts towards Povarov&#8208;type reactions driven by laser or LED irradiation, giving rise to complex tricyclic N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds derived from bioactive molecules. Mechanistic studies revealed that the Au15 cluster demonstrates two&#8208;photon absorption when excited by a 700&#160;nm laser, while maintaining a single&#8208;photon excitation process under red LED irradiation. Furthermore, the versatility and broad applicability of the Au15 photocatalyst were underscored through batch&#8208;scalable photoreactions and various other deep&#8208;red light&#8208;induced reactions. Overall, the combination of nonlinear optics and photocatalysis of metal nanoclusters provides a new avenue for deep&#8208;red photocatalysis with continuous and scalable capabilities.

         <title>Twisted Tin&#8208;Chloride Perovskite Single&#8208;Crystal Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Replacing lead with tin in a single&#8208;crystal halide perovskite heterostructure drives a twist between the perovskite (gray) and intergrowth (blue) layers. The accompanying structural distortions and interfacial strain change the calculated orbital composition of the band edges and enable high in&#8208;plane optical anisotropy in the Sn analog. (VBT = valence band top; CBB = conduction band bottom).








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly affords simpler synthetic routes to heterostructures compared with manual layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking, yet controlling interlayer twist angles in a bulk solid remains an outstanding challenge. We report two new single&#8208;crystal heterostructures: (Sn2Cl2)(CYS)2SnCl4 (CYS = +NH3(CH2)2S&#8211;; Sn_CYS) and (Sn2Cl2)(SeCYS)2SnCl4 (SeCYS = +NH3(CH2)2Se&#8211;; Sn_SeCYS) synthesized in solution, with alternating perovskite and intergrowth layers. Notably, compared to the recently reported lead analog, (Pb2Cl2)(CYS)2PbCl4 (Pb_CYS), the tin heterostructures feature a twist between the perovskite and intergrowth layers. We trace this twist to local distortions at the Sn centers, which change the interfacial lattice&#8208;matching requirements compared to those of the Pb analog. Electronic band structure calculations show that the striking differences in the relative energies of perovskite&#8208; and intergrowth&#8208;derived bands in Sn_CYS and Pb_CYS arise from structural and not compositional differences. The structural anisotropy of Sn_CYS is also reflected in a large in&#8208;plane photoluminescence linear anisotropy ratio. Interfacial strain further affords differential incorporation of Pb into the perovskite and intergrowth layers of the Sn heterostructures, resulting in redshifted optical absorption onsets. Thus, we posit that local structural distortions may be exploited to manipulate the twist angle and interfacial strain in bulk heterostructures, providing a new handle for tuning the band alignments of bulk quantum&#8208;well electronic structures.

         <title>Highly Stable Twin Defects Enabled by High Entropy Configuration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;confined FeCoNiMn based entropy&#8208;enhanced nanocatalysts host highly stable, concentrated twin defects. The configurational flexibility of multi&#8208;element twins allows high&#8208;energy states to transform into energetically favorable twins rather than being detwinned. Deep learning, in situ TEM, and molecular dynamics reveal atomic&#8208;scale strain and multi&#8208;step formation dynamics, with these stable twins persisting throughout synthesis and catalytic OER, demonstrating entropy&#8208;driven defect stabilization.








Abstract
The strategic engineering of crystalline defects has been proven effective in enhancing the efficiency of metallic catalysts. However, owing to the confined and metastable nature of these defects, controlling their formation in nanosized particles remains challenging, especially in multi&#8208;element alloy catalysts, where complex interactions further complicate defect stabilization. Herein, we report concentrated and stable twin defects in carbon&#8208;confined FeCoNiMn nanocatalysts (denoted as T&#8208;FeCoNiMn/C), spotlighting entropy&#8208;sensitive formation mechanisms and durable catalytic performance. By integrating deep learning, in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and molecular dynamics simulations, we reveal the atomic&#8208;scale strain distribution in T&#8208;FeCoNiMn/C and disclose the multi&#8208;step formation dynamics of these twin defects. Notably, the entropy&#8208;enhanced multielement nature endows twin defects with highly flexible atomic configurations and a broad energy landscape, allowing structurally adaptable high&#8208;energy configurations to relax into more energetically favorable twins rather than detwinning; ultimately, highly concentrated and stable twin configurations prevail throughout not only the synthesis process but also the following catalysis service for oxygen evolution reactions. Our findings demonstrate entropy&#8208;driven twin defect stabilization in metallic nanocatalysts, offering new strategies for catalytic structural engineering.

         <title>3D Covalent Organic Frameworks from Twistable Building Block Toward an Unprecedented ibd&#8208;r Topology for Efficient C3H6/C2H4 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three novel isoreticular 3D COFs, JUC&#8208;320, &#8208;321, and &#8208;322, were constructed by combining a 6&#8208;coordinated (6&#8208;c) building block with a twistable D3&#8208;symmetric configuration and three different rectangular D2h&#8208;symmetric building blocks. These COFs feature an unprecedented self&#8208;catenated ibd&#8208;r topology with reduced pore sizes and exhibit outstanding separation capabilities for C3H6/C2H4.








Abstract
Owing to the limited diversity of structural topologies and pore features, it remains a tremendous challenge to elaborately design and synthesize three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) for efficient gas separation. In this study, we present a series of isoreticular 3D COFs using [6&#160;+&#160;4] design strategy based on a designed 6&#8208;coordinated (6&#8208;c) building block with twistable D3&#8208;symmetric configuration and three different rectangular building blocks, named JUC&#8208;320, &#8208;321, and &#8208;322, respectively. The torsional flexibility of 6&#8208;c building blocks enables the targeted network to adopt an unprecedented self&#8208;catenated ibd&#8208;r topology with reduced pore sizes. Remarkably, these COFs exhibit exceptional performances in C3H6/C2H4 separation with high adsorption ratios and selectivities. Dynamic breakthrough experiments further confirmed their ability to efficiently separate C3H6/C2H4 mixtures (30/70, v/v), yielding polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 (&gt;99.99%). This work offers a useful strategy for constructing 3D COFs with unprecedented topologies and porous architectures toward efficient gas separation.

&lt;p&gt;Three novel isoreticular 3D COFs, JUC-320, -321, and -322, were constructed by combining a 6-coordinated (6-c) building block with a twistable &lt;i&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Photoactive Luminescence in a Silver Cluster Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first photo&#8208;responsive luminescent silver cluster (Ag8) was reported, whose phosphorescence can be activated through UV light irradiation in crystal state. Mechanism study revealed that the photo&#8208;response of Ag8 was attributed to the photo&#8208;induced oxygen scavenging by methanol within the lattice, which relieved the quenching of the phosphorescence of the metal cluster, leading to a &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; response.








Abstract
Due to their atomically precise structures and tunable electronic properties, coinage metal clusters have emerged as a significant class of luminescent materials, demonstrating broad application potential in the development of optical sensors and light&#8208;emitting diodes. Recently, luminescent coinage metal clusters exhibiting novel photophysical properties, such as afterglow emission, circularly polarized luminescence, near&#8208;infrared luminescence, and x&#8208;ray excited luminescence, have been successively reported, attracting significant research attention. In this work, the first photo&#8208;responsive luminescent silver cluster (Ag8) was reported, whose phosphorescence can be activated through UV light irradiation in crystal state. Mechanism study revealed that the photo&#8208;response of Ag8 was attributed to the photo&#8208;induced oxygen scavenging by methanol within the lattice, which relieved the quenching of the phosphorescence of the metal cluster, leading to a &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; response. Due to its reversible photoactive luminescent properties in the solid state and excellent stability, a specialized photo&#8208;responsive ink for three&#8208;dimensional printing was developed based on Ag8. This study expands the range of luminescent coinage metal clusters and offers a novel strategy for the development of coinage metal cluster&#8208;based stimuli&#8208;responsive materials.

         <title>Intrinsic Ni0&#8211;Ni&#948;+ Pairs in Anti&#8208;Perovskite NiNNi3 Act as Hydrogen Radical Emitters for Cu Enabling Promoted Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intrinsic Ni&#8304;&#8211;Ni&#948;+ pairs in anti&#8208;perovskite NiNNi3 act as precision hydrogen&#8208;radical emitters: their surface electrostatic potential gradient cleaves H&#9472;OH bonds, generates abundant *H while suppressing HER, and funnels spillover *H to Cu for low&#8208;barrier *NO hydrogenation, enabling ampere&#8208;level nitrate reduction to NH3 at +0.05 VRHE. 








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction (NO3RR) enables ambient&#8208;condition ammonia production, while ampere&#8208;level application is still limited by the unsatisfactory efficiency due to the insufficient *H supply for rapid *NO hydrogenation. Herein, we tackled this challenge by constructing the NiNNi3/Cu heterostructure catalyst that utilizes the substantial electrostatic potential differences derived from the intrinsic Ni0&#8211;Ni&#948;+ pairs in anti&#8208;perovskite NiNNi3 to accelerate the O&#9472;H bond cleavage for *H generation, enhancing NO3RR. Consequently, the NiNNi3/Cu delivers 1.2 A cm&#8722;2 with 100&#160;&#177;&#160;0.7% Faradaic efficiency (FE) at ultralow +0.05 VRHE. The paired electrosynthesis by coupling NO3RR with formaldehyde oxidation yields 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a low cell voltage of 0.8&#160;V, with 95% NH3&#8208;FE and 90% formate&#8208;FE. Importantly, industrial&#8208;level application is further demonstrated by a flow cell with 25 cm2 electrode that delivers 20 A, and produces 64&#160;g NH4Cl for 20&#160;h. This work provides a novel rationale for catalyst design that can boost *H density to accelerate hydrogenation kinetics for advanced electrosynthesis applications.

         <title>Construction of Terminal Exposed Ti Active Sites Based on Aluminum Oxo Cluster Supports for Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a universal &#8220;solvent magnified differentiated aggregation&#8221; strategy to construct terminal exposed Ti based on aluminum oxo cluster supports. The supports featuring natural Al2O3&#8208;like structure were proved to be highly customizable to incorporate functional groups and immobilizing single&#8208;atom Ti, realizing high atomic utilization.








Abstract
Maximize the exposure of Ti active sites in titanium&#8208;oxo clusters (TOCs) has been considered as the key to highly efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction. However, the fast aggregation rate of Ti4+ greatly limits its realization. Herein, we reported a universal strategy to precisely immobilize and disperse Ti via aluminum oxo clusters (AlOCs) supports. Leveraging the coordination&#8208;delay effects of alcohol solvents to modulate the differentiated aggregation kinetics of Ti4+ and Al3+, we successfully induced the priority assembly of Al3+ into AlOC supports, and further immobilized Ti on it in a terminal&#8208;exposed mode. Based on this strategy, we successfully synthesized a structural well&#8208;defined Ti4Al6 cluster, which featured a natural &#952;&#8208;Al2O3&#8208;like support. This support platform can be readily modified for functionalization (such as incorporation of ferrocene) or realizing single Ti dispersity. The optimal catalyst, Ti2Al4&#8208;Fc (featuring a &#947;&#8208;Al2O3&#8208;like support, Fc = ferrocenecarboxylate) realized a high Ti turnover frequency of 2.4&#160;h&#8722;1 in visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 photoreduction, significantly higher than many reported Ti&#8208;based photocatalysts. This work provides a new paradigm for designing metal&#8208;oxo cluster&#8208;based photocatalysts with atomic dispersity and high atomic utilization.

In the Ni1/Mn2&#8208;MIL catalyst, the Ni1 site activates CO2 to form CO, and the Mn2 site facilitates *COCHO intermediate formation. Strong electronic interaction between adjacent Ni1 and Mn2 sites induces a charge&#8208;polarized center, weakening electrostatic repulsion between C1 and C2 intermediates. This promotes C1&#8211;C2 coupling to form the key C3 intermediate *CH2OCOCO, and enhances C3H8 selectivity.








Abstract
The photocatalytic conversion of CO2 and H2O into long carbon chain products (Cn, n&#160;&#8805;&#160;3) presents a sustainable strategy for synthesizing high&#8208;value fuels and chemicals. However, the synthesis of long carbon chain products under mild conditions still faces great challenges, largely due to sluggish multi&#8208;electron/proton transfer kinetics and the thermodynamically unfavorable C1&#8211;C1 and C1&#8211;C2 coupling processes. In this study, we developed tri&#8208;metal active sites composed of Ni single atoms and Mn2 dual atoms anchored on NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125(Ti) (Ni1/Mn2&#8208;MIL) for synergistic photocatalytic C3H8 production. The synthesized Ni1/Mn2&#8208;MIL catalyst achieved efficient CO2 photoreduction (CO2PR) in pure water, yielding 32.2&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 of C3H8 with 81.3% electron&#8208;based selectivity, significantly outperforming Ni1&#8208;MIL and Mn2&#8208;MIL. Remarkably, the catalyst exhibited exceptional stability over 50 cycles without degradation. Integrated experimental and theoretical investigations revealed that the Ni1 site activates CO2 to form CO, while the adjacent Mn2 site promotes the formation of *COCHO intermediates. Strong electronic interactions between Ni1 and Mn2 create charge&#8208;polarized active sites, which mitigate electrostatic repulsion between C1 and C2 intermediates, thereby promoting C&#8211;C coupling and subsequent formation of the *CH2OCOCO intermediates. Consequently, both the selectivity and catalytic efficiency toward C3H8 production are significantly enhanced.

         <title>Boosting Cancer Chemoimmunotherapy with Mitochondria&#8208;Targeting Iridium(III)&#8208;Based Immunogenic Oncosis Inducers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iridium(III) complexes modified with benzothiazole and benzoselenazole moieties were designed to concurrently trigger oncosis and activate the cyclic GMP&#8211;AMP synthase&#8211;stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS&#8211;STING) pathway, thereby bridging chemotherapy with immunotherapy








Abstract
Most clinically used chemotherapeutic agents act by inducing apoptosis. However, their clinical effectiveness is often limited by poor therapeutic efficacy and the rapid development of drug resistance. In contrast, oncosis, as an inflammatory form of cell death independent of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and apoptotic pathways, exhibits unique advantages in overcoming tumor drug resistance and regulating anti&#8208;tumor immune responses. Herein, we present the first iridium(III)&#8208;based immunogenic oncosis inducers designed to concurrently induce oncosis and activate the cGAS&#8211;STING pathway, thereby bridging chemotherapy with immunotherapy. Through a bioisosteric design strategy, we identified benzoselenazole and benzothiazole derivatives as key pharmacophores for triggering oncosis. These iridium(III)&#8208;based oncosis&#8208;inducers rapidly disrupt mitochondrial architecture, induce oxidative stress, and promote Ca(II) release, which subsequently activate calpain and porimin to initiate oncosis in multidrug&#8208;resistant cancer cells. Transcriptomic profiling further revealed their ability to regulate actin cytoskeleton organization, modulate ABC transporter activity, and affect glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. Notably, the metal complexes induce mitochondrial swelling and mt&#8208;DNA damage, leading to robust activation of the cGAS&#8211;STING innate immune pathway and eliciting a strong anticancer immune response. Based on these multimodal mechanisms, the Ir(III)&#8208;based immunogenic oncosis inducers were able to effectively kill drug&#8208;resistant cancer cells and enhance the anticancer immune response in tumor mouse models.

         <title>Physicochemically Informed Axial Chirality Descriptors Enable Accurate Prediction of Atropisomeric Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine learning model for atropisomers&#8217; stability is developed. By integrating a physicochemically&#8208;informed axial chirality structure descriptor (ACSD) with a graph attention network (GAT), the model accurately predicts rotational barriers. Its robustness is validated on complex drugs and molecular switches, providing a powerful tool for rational catalyst and drug design.








Abstract
Atropisomers play a vital role in asymmetric synthesis, drug discovery, and the development of functional materials. However, the rational design of atropisomers is challenging due to the difficulty in predicting their configurational stability, which depends on the rotational barrier (&#916;G&#8225;). Here, we introduce ACSD&#8208;GAT, a deep learning framework that addresses this issue. Our approach comprises a newly curated benchmark dataset of 1015 experimentally measured rotational barrier, along with a physicochemically informed axial chirality structure descriptor (ACSD) that explicitly quantifies both static and dynamic steric repulsion during rotation. By integrating the ACSD with a graph attention network (GAT), our model accurately predicts the rotational barrier, achieving an R2 of 0.91 and a RMSE of 2.02&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1 on test datasets. The robustness and real&#8208;world applicability of the model are also demonstrated through rigorous validation with complex pharmaceuticals, molecular switches, and newly synthesized atropisomers.

         <title>Analyte&#8208;Targeted Plasmonic Hotspots on Superlattice Mirror Enable Ultra&#8208;Broad&#8208;Range SERS Sensing of Acetylcholinesterase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we introduce a dynamic SERS strategy that synchronizes real&#8208;time hotspot generation with target recognition. A plasmonic superlattice mirror and cyclodextrin&#8208;functionalized superparticles enable enzymatic self&#8208;assembly of nanoparticle&#8208;on&#8208;mirror nanocavities via competitive host&#8211;guest displacement. This design ensures spatiotemporally synchronized cavity formation, hotspot activation, and analyte binding, achieving background&#8208;free AChE detection across 9 orders of magnitude for diagnostic and environmental applications.








Abstract
Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) enables molecular fingerprinting, but its widespread application is limited by poor detection sensitivity and signal reproducibility due to inefficient analyte retention in hotspots, less than 1 in 100,&#160;000 molecules. To address this, we present a dynamic sensing strategy that actively couples in&#8208;situ analyte recognition with the real&#8208;time formation of plasmonic hotspots. The system integrates a resonant plasmonic nanoparticle superlattice monolayer as a 2D optical cavity and gap&#8208;enhanced Au&#8208;Ag superparticles functionalized with cyclodextrin molecular spacers. Enzymatic recognition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), a pivotal neurofunctional enzyme, induces the self&#8208;assembly of high&#8208;density nanoparticle&#8208;on&#8208;&#8220;superlattice mirror&#8221; (NPoSM) nanocavities through competitive host&#8208;guest displacement during acetylthiocholine hydrolysis. This active guidance ensures spatiotemporal synchronization between nanocavity formation, hotspot activation, and target binding. The system achieves high specificity with background&#8208;free, ultrasensitive AChE detection over a 9&#8208;order dynamic range (10&#8722;8 to 10&#160;U/L), offering a restricted detection platform for SERS sensing in molecular diagnostics, neurotoxicity assessment, and environmental monitoring.

         <dc:description>
An asymmetric intramolecular hydride shift reaction has been developed that is catalyzed by Al Lewis acids in conjunction with a chiral BINOL&#8208;derived ligand. Racemic THP substrates are transformed into cyclohexene products via an intermediate prochiral enone; which undergoes a key 1,5&#8208;hydride shift reaction. This reaction works well on a gram scale, the desired products are formed with very high enantioselectivity (up to&#160;&gt;98:2 e.r.) and the chiral ligand is easy to recover. Importantly, the cyclohexene products contain functionality that can be easily derivatized as exemplified in the paper.








Abstract
An asymmetric intramolecular hydride shift reaction has been developed that is catalyzed by Al Lewis acids in conjunction with a chiral BINOL&#8208;derived ligand. Racemic THP substrates are transformed into cyclohexene products via a prochiral intermediate ring opened enone; which then undergoes a key 1,5&#8208;hydride shift reaction. This reaction is operationally simple, works well on a gram scale, and the desired products are formed with very high enantioselectivity (up to&#160;&gt;98:2 e.r.). Importantly, the cyclohexene products contain functionality that can be easily derivatized and this is exemplified in the paper. Finally, a model is presented for the enantioselective hydride shift that is based on previous DFT studies.

         <title>Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Complexes Based on Terpyridine Bi&#8208;Functionalization for Efficient Solar&#8208;Driven H2O2 Production</title>

Achieving precise control over donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) stacking and optimizing through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) for efficient photocatalysis remains great challenging. Herein, we develop and utilize a novel terpyridine bi&#8208;functionalization strategy to construct two non&#8208;noble metal Zn&#8208;coordinated complexes, enabling finely tunable D&#8211;A stacking. The distinct intramolecular stacking modes lead to markedly different TSCT behaviors and photocatalytic performances in hydrogen peroxide production.








Abstract
To achieve precise spatial control of donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) stacking and optimize through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) for efficient photocatalysis, we develop a novel terpyridine bi&#8208;functionalization strategy, which utilizes the dissymmetrical 6&#8208; and 4&#8242;&#8208;functionalization of 2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8243;&#8208;terpyridine (tpy) scaffold with triphenyltriazine (acceptor) and triphenylamine (donor) units. Using this strategy, we designed and synthesized two ligands, L1 and L2, differing by a single phenylene unit in length. Upon coordination with Zn(II), the D and A units in the resulting complexes S1 and S2 are precisely edited at the molecular level, giving rise to distinct stacking geometries: slip&#8208;stacked S1 and co&#8208;facially S2. S2 significantly enhances TSCT, resulting in improved visible&#8208;light absorption, prolonged charge carrier lifetime, superior charge separation efficiency and achieves a photocatalytic efficiency (2063 &#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1) for H2O2 production that is twice that of S1 without the need for sacrificial agents. This work demonstrates the unique advantages of terpyridine bi&#8208;functionalization strategy in constructing photocatalytic materials with tunable TSCT, providing new insights for the design and functional development of supramolecular systems.

         <title>B&#8208;N Fused Anthracene as Functional Linker for &#960;&#8208;Extended Viologens: Near&#8208;IR Emission and Electrochromism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce &#960;&#8211;extended viologens with B&#8208;N fused dipyridylanthracene (BDPA) as conduit for delocalization. Quaternization of pyridyl&#8208;substituted BDPA by methylation or Lewis pair formation with B(C6F5)3 produces strongly colored compounds that are emissive in the near&#8208;IR. Spectroelectrochemical studies reveal reversible formation of doubly reduced species that adopt a closed shell electronic configuration with prominent quinoidal delocalization.








Abstract
As prototypical organic electrochromic materials viologens have been extensively studied in display technologies, smart materials, and energy storage applications. Their properties can be fine&#8208;tuned by introducing different substituents on the pyridine rings, fusion with heteroatoms, or insertion of &#960;&#8211;conjugated linkers. In this article we study the effect of B&#8208;N fused dipyridylanthracene (BDPA) as a novel linker unit in viologens on the electronic structure, optical properties, and electrochromic characteristics. Quaternization of pyridyl&#8208;functionalized BDPA (1Py) by N&#8208;methylation or complexation with B(C6F5)3 as a powerful Lewis acid gives rise to two fundamentally different &#960;&#8208;extended viologens, dicationic [1Py&#8208;Me](PF6)2, and the neutral complex 1Py&#8208;BCF. We investigate the effect of these different quaternization methods on the LUMO energy, band gaps, absorption and emission, and the self&#8208;sensitized reactivity toward oxygen. We also demonstrate facile electrochemical reduction to singly and multiply reduced species. Spectroelectrochemical and computational studies reveal formation of strongly colored doubly reduced species with a closed shell electronic configuration and prominent quinoidal delocalization. The corresponding radical anions give rise to absorptions in the near&#8208;IR. A prototype electrochromic device with 1Py&#8208;BCF as the redox&#8208;active material is also presented.

         <title>Esterase&#8208;Responsive Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Hydropersulfide Donors Mitigate Doxorubicin Cardiotoxicity While Preserving Anticancer Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Esterase&#8208;activated, triphenylphosphine&#8208;conjugated hydropersulfide (RSSH) donors are developed that selectively release RSSH in mitochondria. These compounds protect cardiomyocytes from doxorubicin&#8208;induced toxicity while enhancing its anticancer activity. Mechanistic studies reveal that these diverging effects arise from differences in basal reactive sulfur species, mitochondrial physiology, and redox states between cardiac and cancer cells.








Abstract
Therapeutic agents that protect the heart from doxorubicin (DOX) toxicity without reducing its anticancer efficacy remain a critical unmet need. We report esterase&#8208;activated hydropersulfide (RSSH) donors, alkyl sulfenyl thiocarbonate (AST&#8208;2), and acetoxy perthiocarbamate (APT&#8208;1), together with their mitochondria&#8208;targeted analogs, AST&#8208;2&#8208;TPP and APT&#8208;1&#8208;TPP, which bear a triphenylphosphonium (TPP&#8314;) moiety. These compounds release RSSH upon esterase activation with tunable half&#8208;lives (20&#8211;125&#160;min in PBS, pH 7.4). LC&#8211;MS/MS analysis revealed that APT&#8208;1 elevates hydropersulfide levels in the cytosol of H9c2 cardiomyoblasts, whereas its mitochondrial analog, APT&#8208;1&#8208;TPP, increases levels in mitochondria. All donors attenuated DOX&#8208;induced toxicity in H9c2 cells, but in cancer cell lines (HepG2, MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;468, MCF&#8208;7), APT&#8208;1 did not blunt DOX cytotoxicity and APT&#8208;1&#8208;TPP synergistically enhanced its activity. Mechanistic studies revealed that both APT&#8208;1 and APT&#8208;1&#8208;TPP rescue DOX&#8208;induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization and ATP depletion in H9c2 cells but not in HepG2 cells. Further characterization indicated that cancer cells exhibit higher basal sulfane sulfur levels and mitochondrial membrane potentials compared to H9c2 cells, suggesting that divergent redox environments may underlie these contrasting effects. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that redox heterogeneity between cardiac and cancer cells can be exploited to develop cardioprotective interventions that preserve or enhance DOX's anticancer efficacy.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
At industrial current densities (&gt;0.4 A cm&#8722;2), pulsed CO2 reduction (p&#8208;CO2RR) in flow&#8208;cell gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) achieves 82.7% C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FE) by suppressing hydrogen evolution. We identify flooding suppression through dynamic wettability control (instead of CuxO formation) as the key mechanism. Combined experimental and simulation evidence reveals how alternating potentials modulate interfacial wettability to retard flooding for high CO2 mass transfer.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR) converts CO2 into value&#8208;added fuels and chemicals using renewable electricity. Pulsed CO2RR(p&#8208;CO2RR) has been proposed to enhance the selectivity of multicarbon products (C2+), yet mechanistic clarity at industrially relevant rates remains limited by the complex gas&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid microenvironment of gas&#8208;diffusion electrodes (GDEs). Here, we investigate p&#8208;CO2RR in GDE flow&#8208;cells operating at industrially&#8208;relevant current densities. Under cathodic potentials where conventional constant&#8208;potential CO2 electrolysis yields&#160;&gt;&#160;70% H2 (Faradaic efficiency, FE), pulsed operation achieves a maximum C2+ FE of 82.7% at current densities above 0.4 A cm&#8722;2. Operando Raman and UV&#8211;visible spectroscopy indicates that formation of CuxO only weakly perturbs the coverage of *CO intermediates, suggesting that redox restructuring is not the principal driver of pulse&#8208;enhanced C2+ production. Instead, ex situ scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (SEM&#8208;EDS) mapping reveals a strong correlation between reduced electrolyte intrusion and improved C2+ selectivity, with pulsing stabilizing the gas&#8211;liquid interface, suppressing electrolyte penetration, and enhancing CO2 mass transfer. These experimental findings are supported by numerical simulations of electrochemical capillary&#8208;pressure dynamics, which confirm that alternating cathodic and anodic potentials modulate interfacial wettability to retard flooding. These mechanistic insights contribute to the design principles for industrial p&#8208;CO2RR systems, emphasizing hydrodynamic management over traditional catalyst engineering approaches.

         <title>Pd/Cu Single Atom Alloys for Selective Alcohol Dehydrogenation: From Single Crystalline to Nanostructured Model Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Model Pd/Cu single atom alloy catalysts were prepared in nanostructured form and structurally characterized. They show an outstanding performance in dehydrogenating butanol to butanal with 100% selectivity &#8211; the property that cannot be reproduced over simplified single crystalline Pd/Cu(111) counterparts. It is one of the first evidences that the catalytic performance of single atom alloys can be greatly enhanced due to their nanoscopic nature.








Abstract
Heterogeneous catalysts based on Single Atom Alloys (SAA) play a significant role in numerous technical processes. The fundamental working principles of these systems, however, remain poorly understood, especially the aspects related to the nanoscopic nature of bimetallic particles and the associated structure&#8208;reactivity relationships. In this study, we developed for the first time well&#8208;defined SAA catalysts consisting of Pd atomically dispersed in Cu nanoparticles prepared under ultra&#8208;high vacuum (UHV) conditions on model Al2O3/NiAl(110) support. Employing a unique combination of surface sensitive techniques &#8211; scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS), molecular beams &#8211; and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we performed detailed structural characterization of these systems at the microscopic level. We demonstrate that Pd disperses atomically in Cu nanoparticles and becomes partly negatively charged. Importantly, these Pd/Cu nanostructured systems show an outstanding catalytic performance in selective dehydrogenation of butanol and exhibit 100% selectivity toward butanal over a broad range of Pd loadings &#8211; the property that cannot be reproduced employing simplified single crystalline Pd/Cu(111) counterparts. The developed approach for preparation and characterization of these nanostructured SAA&#8208;catalysts lays a foundation for further fundamental&#8208;level catalytic studies on this important class of materials and their rational design for practical applications.

         <title>Leveraging 3d&#8208;4f Coordination: Molecular Quantum Spring&#8208;Magnet Behavior in Axial Ni2Ln Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report heterotrimetallic Ni2Ln complexes mimicking exchange spring magnets at the molecular level. CASSCF calculations show collinear anisotropy axes, while &#181;SQUID studies reveal slow relaxation and open hysteresis in Ni2Tb, Ni2Dy, and Ni2Ho. Ferromagnetic 3d&#8211;4f coupling and anisotropy alignment enhance bistability, offering promise for quantum, and nanoscale magnetic devices.








Abstract
We report heterotrimetallic 3d&#8211;4f complexes, mimicking classical exchange spring magnets at the molecular scale. The complexes feature a linear Ni&#183;&#183;&#183;Ln&#183;&#183;&#183;Ni core, where the lanthanide ion is sandwiched between two Ni2+ centers coordinated by N3O3 ligand environments. The complexes are isostructural, while CASSCF calculations reveal collinear anisotropy axes and favorable electronic configurations for magnetic bistability in selected systems. Magnetic characterization via DC, AC, and &#181;SQUID magnetometry down to 30 mK demonstrates slow magnetic relaxation and open hysteresis loops exclusively in Ni2Tb, Ni2Dy, and Ni2Ho. These systems exhibit ferromagnetic 3d&#8208;4f coupling, while their isolated or antiferromagnetically coupled analogs (Ni2Y, Zn2Tb/Dy) and Ni2Er/Yb counterparts show fast relaxation and closed loops. Analysis suggests that the Ni2+ ions alone, with modest anisotropy, deviate from the expected &#8220;hard&#8221; magnetic behavior due to a broad zero&#8208;field QTM, while the Ln3+ ions alone serve as the &#8220;soft&#8221; phase with large magnetic moments and sharp zero&#8208;field QTM. Nevertheless, when brought together, their coupling and alignment of the anisotropy axis enhances the magnetic performance with exchange&#8208;bias features mimicking the macroscopic exchange spring magnets. We highlight an optimal utilization of 3d&#8208;4f coordination in designing molecular magnets with tunable relaxation and bistability, advancing prospects for quantum information and nanoscale magnetic devices.

         <title>Spatially Orchestrated Oxygen Motifs Decouple Ion Dissociation/Migration in Liquid Crystal Elastomer for High&#8208; Performance Solid&#8208;State Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatially orchestrated oxygen coordination within a multi&#8208;crosslinked liquid&#8208;crystal&#8208;elastomer (LCE) electrolyte enables a cooperative &#8220;anchor&#8211;relay&#8221; mechanism for Li+ transport. Carbonyl oxygens act as stationary anchors for Li&#8208;salt dissociation, while ether oxygens function as dynamic relays for rapid ion hopping through ordered mesophases. This programmable coordination network achieves high ionic conductivity (4.05 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1), a Li+ transference number of 0.78, and dendrite&#8208;free cycling. 








Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) emerge as prime candidates for next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries, capitalizing on their intrinsic electrochemical robustness and enhanced safety profiles. However, overcoming the inherent trade&#8208;off between efficient lithium&#8208;salt dissociation and rapid ion migration remains a fundamental challenge for SPEs. We propose a programmable liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) framework with spatially patterned carbonyl (&#9472;C&#9552;O) and ether (&#9472;C&#9472;O&#9472;C&#9472;) oxygen motifs. In this hierarchical architecture, carbonyl groups act as stationary anchors to dissociate LiTFSI via strong coordination, while ether chains serve as dynamic relays enabling barrier&#8208;reduced Li&#8314; hopping along oriented mesophases. This decoupled &#8220;anchor&#8208;relay&#8221; mechanism achieves outstanding room&#8208;temperature performance: ionic conductivity of 4.05&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 and Li&#8314; transference number of 0.78. The synergistically induced LiF&#8208;rich interphase further suppresses dendrite growth, the symmetric Li//Li cell exhibits a long&#8208;term cycling lifespan over 1000&#160;h with a low overpotential of 300&#160;mV, delivering exceptional cycling stability in both LiFePO4//Li cell (90.1% capacity retention after 500 cycles) and high&#8208;voltage LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2//Li cell systems. The proposed LCEs as a transformative platform for next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state batteries through rational molecular engineering.

         <title>Investigation of Intercellular Trafficking of Global Glycosylphosphatidylinositol&#8208;Anchored Proteins Using Cell Metabolic Engineering and Transwell Coculture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method to explore intercellular GPI&#8208;anchored protein trafficking using metabolically engineered donor cells containing azide&#8208;labelled GPIs for Transwell coculture with recipient cells was developed to directly demonstrate GPI&#8208;anchored protein transfer between cells through exosomes, the influences of cell membrane cholesterol and other factors, and preferred trafficking of GPI&#8208;anchored proteins from cancer to normal cells.








Abstract
Glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) are essential for GPI&#8208;anchored proteins (GPI&#8208;APs), as the loose association of GPIs with the cell membrane is thought to facilitate GPI&#8208;AP shedding and intercellular trafficking, which dictates cell communication. To explore this property, a novel method was developed based on metabolic engineering of GPI&#8208;APs in live cells and coculture of labelled donor cells along with recipient cells in a Transwell system for straight observation of intercellular GPI&#8208;AP transfer. Studies using this method have provided direct proof of intercellular GPI&#8208;AP trafficking and its dependence on cell types. Notably, there is a preference for GPI&#8208;AP transfer from cancer to normal cells. Lipid raft&#8208;mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis play a critical role in GPI&#8208;AP trafficking and incorporation, with extracellular vesicles (EVs) involved as GPI&#8208;AP transporters. It is further revealed that depleting cholesterol in the donor cell can enhance GPI&#8208;AP shedding and trafficking. The method also allowed for in&#8208;depth studies to gain insights into the regulatory mechanisms of GPI&#8208;AP trafficking, such as its association with phospholipase A2 (PLA2), EV biogenesis, and membrane&#8208;adjacent Ras and Rho signaling pathways. The results are important not only for understanding GPI biology but also for its biomedical applications, for example, GPI&#8208;based cancer therapy.

         <title>Engineering Intralayer Anisotropy in Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mixed linker strategy controls in&#8208;plane anisotropy in 2D COFs through longitudinal diamine linker length variation. T&#8208;COF&#8208;1, constructed with the shortest diamine, enhances interchain electronic coupling, achieving 93.81% visible&#8208;light NADH regeneration and sustaining 14.67% conversion under near&#8208;IR light, demonstrating photodynamic therapy potential.








Abstract
Precise control of intralayer anisotropy in two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) remains a significant challenge in materials design. We address this through a mixed&#8208;linker strategy using 8&#8208;connected pyrene and triphenylamine monomers with 4&#8208;connected ETTA to form 1D nanoribbons. These ribbons are longitudinally stitched by diamines of programmable lengths, enabling precise in&#8208;plane anisotropy tuning. Shortening the linkers from biphenyl to phenyl (T&#8208;COF&#8208;2 &#8594; T&#8208;COF&#8208;1) induces compressive strain within the &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone, enhancing &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization and boosting photogenerated charge carrier mobility by over fourfold. Consequently, T&#8208;COF&#8208;1 achieves a 93.81% conversion efficiency in visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) oxidation&#8212;a 4.26&#8208;fold enhancement over T&#8208;COF&#8208;2&#8212;along with a 1.41% apparent quantum yield at 420 nm. Remarkably, T&#8208;COF&#8208;1 retains substantial activity under 650 nm near&#8208;infrared light (14.67% conversion, 0.11% quantum yield), highlighting its potential for photodynamic therapy. This work establishes interchain covalent proximity as a design principle for rationally engineering high&#8208;performance COF photocatalysts, with broad implications for solar energy conversion and biomedical applications.

         <title>Meltable Polycarbonate Polymersomes as Photoresponsive Micro&#8208;Analgesia Pumps for Concurrent Tumor Therapy and Pain Relief</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoresponsive micro&#8208;analgesic pumps were successfully developed by encapsulating the non&#8208;opioid analgesic tetrodotoxin (TTX) within meltable polycarbonate polymersomes. Upon 660&#160;nm laser irradiation, these micro&#8208;analgesic pumps generate photothermal and photodynamic effects, inducing a crystalline&#8208;to&#8208;fluidic phase transition of the polycarbonate bilayers that triggers TTX release, thereby enabling concurrent tumor inhibition and cancer pain relief.








Abstract
Over 75% of patients with advanced&#8208;stage tumors experience severe cancer&#8208;associated pain, yet current opioid&#8208;based therapies are limited by dose&#8208;dependent toxicity, adverse side effects, and poor delivery control. Here, we present a light&#8208;responsive meltable polycarbonate polymersome (MPP) micro&#8208;analgesia pump, self&#8208;assembled from Nile blue&#8208;labeled polycarbonate block copolymers encapsulating tetrodotoxin (TTX), a non&#8208;opioid analgesic. The MPPs effectively suppress spontaneous TTX leakage under dark conditions, thereby minimizing off&#8208;target toxicity, while enabling on&#8208;demand release upon red light irradiation. This release is driven by localized photothermal heating of aggregated Nile blue moieties, which induces melting of the polycarbonate bilayer membrane. In addition, the photoresponsive system integrates photothermal and photodynamic effects to inhibit tumor growth while simultaneously alleviating tumor&#8208;induced pain. Overall, this strategy provides a promising non&#8208;opioid approach for concurrent management of cancer pain and tumor progression.

Cu(I) dual&#8208;atom sites within a two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) stabilize key C2 intermediates through distinct binding configurations during carbon monoxide (CO) electroreduction, delivering 72% C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FE) at &#8722;430&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 partial current density and a maximum of 86% at &#8722;200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 total current density, thereby meeting commercially viable benchmarks.








Abstract
The electroreduction of carbon monoxide (CO) provides a sustainable pathway to valuable multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products, contributing to carbon neutrality. Enhancing coupling efficiency and selectivity for C2+ formation hinges on precise control of the spatial arrangement of catalytic sites where CO molecules adsorb. Here, we introduce a structurally well&#8208;defined Cu(I) dual&#8208;atom catalyst (DAC) embedded in a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) that is synthesized via a thermal transformation. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCD) reveals Cu2N6 motifs with a Cu&#8211;Cu distance of 3.6&#160;&#197;, stabilized by tetrazolate within a 2D layer, ensuring CO accessibility and efficient coupling. The catalyst achieves a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 72% for C2+ products at a partial current density of &#8722;430&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and a maximum C2+ FE of 86% at a total current density of &#8722;200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. In situ spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the paired Cu nodes stabilize key C2 intermediates via distinct binding configurations, underpinning the system's exceptional performance.

         <title>Unlocking Selective Electrochemical Regulation via Interlayer Anion Competition for Nitrate Extraction from Wastewater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
By engineering structural compatibility between 2D bismuth&#8208;based materials and planar nitrate ions, we developed [Bi2O2]2+ layered electrodes for selective NO3&#8722; capture. A controlled carbonate ion (CO32&#8722;) doping strategy was employed to modulate interlayer bonding energies through metal&#8208;affinity coordination, enhancing NO3&#8722;&#8208;specific adsorption while repelling competing anions. This enables a high NO3&#8722; removal capacity of 182.47&#160;mg g&#8722;1 and a remarkable 90.78% NO3&#8722; removal efficiency in complex ionic systems.








Abstract
Electrochemical separation technology offers an effective approach to recycle valuable nitrogen from industrial wastewater, but its separation efficiency is reduced by competitive electrostatic interactions from multiple ions. By engineering a competitive chemical reaction to facilitate site&#8208;specific electrochemical binding of NO3&#8722;, this approach offers a promising route for high&#8208;efficiency anion separation in complex solutions. Herein, a novel [Bi2O2]2+ layered Faraday electrode was designed with two&#8208;dimensional channels for NO3&#8722; migration and multiple sites that boost its interaction through combined electrostatic and coordination forces. In addition, by strategically introducing exogenous anions, the induced antisite cation defects at Bi3+ sites enhance the coordination of subsequent NO3&#8722; insertion, achieving a NO3&#8722; removal capacity of 182.47&#160;mg g&#8722;1. Meanwhile, the highly charged CO32&#8722; enhances its repulsion against other competitive anions, leading to an impressive removal ratio of 90.78% for NO3&#8722; in multi&#8208;ion solutions. More importantly, exogenous CO32&#8722; intercalation reverses the interlayer binding energy hierarchy between NO3&#8722; and SO42&#8722;, converting the substitution by NO3&#8722; (&#8722;13.12&#160;eV) more thermodynamically favorable than that by SO42&#8722; (&#8722;12.16&#160;eV), enabling spontaneous NO3&#8722; uptake. Our work provides new insights for designing NO3&#8722;&#8208;selective electrodes, enhancing understanding of anion&#8208;interface interactions.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Reorganization and Core&#8208;Shell Confinement Engineering for Full&#8208;Spectrum Solar Absorption and Spatial Thermal Localization in Dynamic Solar Evaporator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>

We prepare Cu0.33(Fe,Co,Ni,Cr)0.67S via cation&#8208;site substitution in CuS. The &#8220;high&#8208;entropy reorganization and core&#8208;shell confinement&#8221; design strategy optimizes the material's performance in terms of solar absorption, heat localization, and stability, as validated by tests and calculations. Integrated into a photovoltaic rotating device, it achieves excellent comprehensive performance in solar desalination, surpassing existing high&#8208;entropy&#8208;based evaporators.








Abstract
Conventional photothermal conversion materials are limited by a conflict between broad&#8208;spectrum absorption and low thermal conductivity, restricting their overall performance in solar desalination. Herein, we report a synergistic &#8220;high&#8208;entropy reorganization and core&#8208;shell confinement&#8221; strategy to synthesize a core&#8208;shell Cu0.33(Fe,Co,Ni,Cr)0.67S with a chemically homogeneous yet structurally heterogeneous architecture. This design offers three key advantages: (1) Strong hybridization between the 3d orbitals of Fe, Co, Ni, Cr, Cu, and the 3p orbitals of S reconfigures the band structure, which generates a high joint density of states that enables 96.66% average absorbance across the 250&#8211;2500&#160;nm wavelength range. (2) Cu0.33(Fe,Co,Ni,Cr)0.67S possesses greater thermodynamic stability than CuS, as demonstrated by its lower formation energy. (3) Core&#8208;shell interfacial phonon scattering, coupled with high&#8208;entropy&#8208;induced lattice distortion, significantly suppresses thermal conductivity. A photovoltaic&#8208;driven rotating evaporator that integrates Cu0.33(Fe,Co,Ni,Cr)0.67S achieves a stable evaporation rate of 3.70&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 in 20 wt% high&#8208;salinity brine with&#160;&lt;&#160;3% decay over 120&#160;h, outperforming other reported high&#8208;entropy&#8208;material&#8208;based evaporators. This work advances the design paradigm for photothermal conversion materials from single&#8208;component modification to a dual&#8208;driven framework of high&#8208;entropy component synergy and core&#8208;shell spatial confinement, providing a transformative solution for stable freshwater production from hypersaline and highly contaminated water sources.

Based on the &#8220;asymmetric spiro&#8208;carbon&#8208;locking architecture&#8221; strategy, (R/S)&#8208;BN&#8208;FLTPA exhibit saturated green emission with the EQEmax of 39.8% and full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 27 nm in non&#8208;sensitized 5 wt% doped device, accompanied by intense chiral EL signals with gEL values of&#160;+0.84/&#8722;1.22&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3. Even at the high doping concentration of 30 wt%, the EQEmax remains at 36.6% with an FWHM of 28 nm, showing an anti&#8208;quenching effect over a wide range of doping concentration.








Abstract
Highly efficient circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) emitters with narrowband emission are promising for ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition (UHD) and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) displays. Herein, we put forward an &#8220;asymmetric spiro&#8208;carbon&#8208;locking architecture&#8221; strategy to construct chiral multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters. Two pairs of enantiomers, (R/S)&#8208;BN&#8208;FLCz and (R/S)&#8208;BN&#8208;FLTPA, are successfully achieved, which show high photoluminescence quantum yields exceeding 95%, narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximums (FWHMs) of 24&#8211;26&#160;nm (0.11&#8211;0.12&#160;eV) and 26&#8211;27&#160;nm (0.12&#160;eV) in films over a wide range of dopant concentrations (1&#8211;30 wt%), and obvious mirror&#8208;image CPL properties in both solution and film states. As a result, the sensitizer&#8208;free organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on BN&#8208;FLCz and BN&#8208;FLTPA exhibit pure green emission with the FWHMs of 26&#160;nm (0.12&#160;eV) and 27&#160;nm (0.13&#160;eV), Commission International de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.16, 0.72) and (0.18, 0.73), and the record&#8208;breaking maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEmaxs) of 37.9% and 39.8%, respectively. Even at the high doping concentration of 30 wt%, the EQEmaxs for BN&#8208;FLCz and BN&#8208;FLTPA remain at 35.5% and 36.6% without sacrificing the color fidelity. Furthermore, the circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) with (R/S)&#8208;BN&#8208;FLCz and (R/S)&#8208;BN&#8208;FLTPA displayed clear circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) signals with electroluminescence dissymmetry factors (gEL) of&#160;+0.85/&#8722;1.19&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 and&#160;+0.84/&#8722;1.22&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3, respectively.

An innovative molecular design strategy of incorporating &#8220;highly luminescent&#8221; and &#8220;3D&#8208;architectured&#8221; substituents into NFAs is proposed to improve its photoluminescence quantum yield and reduce nonradiative energy loss. A triptycene derivative&#8208;modified NFA TQX&#8208;IC is synthesized, showing a high PLQY of 12.80%. Binary D18:TQX&#8208;IC OSCs achieve high VOC (0.963&#160;eV) and low nonradiative energy loss (0.148&#160;eV). Ternary OSCs (D18:BTP&#8208;eC9:TQX&#8208;IC and D18:L8&#8208;BO:TQX&#8208;IC) exhibit enhanced PCEs (19.48% and 20.26%).








Abstract
Developing narrow&#8208;bandgap nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) is a major challenge, but also a promising strategy to reduce nonradiative energy loss for boosting power&#8208;conversion&#8208;efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, we design and synthesize a Y&#8208;series NFA (Y&#8208;NFA, named TQX&#8208;IC) by incorporating a triptycene&#8208;derived &#8220;highly luminescent&#8221; and &#8220;3D&#8208;architectured&#8221; substituent. Study shows that TQX&#8208;IC can suppress aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ), achieving a remarkable PLQY of 12.80%, currently one of the highest reported values among Y&#8208;NFAs. Therefore, its binary OSCs offer an exceptionally low nonradiative energy loss of 0.148&#160;eV, significantly outperforming the control Y&#8208;NFA named Me&#8208;Y (0.209&#160;eV). When incorporating it as a third component into D18:BTP&#8208;eC9 and D18:L8&#8208;BO systems, ternary OSCs based on both D18:BTP&#8208;eC9:TQX&#8208;IC and D18:L8&#8208;BO:TQX&#8208;IC achieve impressive PCEs of 19.48% and 20.26%, respectively, significantly surpassing the Me&#8208;Y based ternary OSCs (18.19% and 18.23%). This enhancement of ternary systems is attributed to the reduced nonradiative energy loss, optimized exciton dynamics, improved charge transport, and optimized active layer morphology and component distribution when compared to their binary systems. Our findings demonstrate that introducing &#8220;highly luminescent&#8221; and &#8220;3D&#8208;architectured&#8221; substituent into Y&#8208;NFAs is a promising approach to enhance PLQY, thereby paving the way toward efficient OSCs.

         <title>Integration of Redox&#8208;Active Viologen Moiety into Bifunctional Covalent Organic Framework for Boosting Electrochemical CO2 Overall Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of redox&#8208; active viologen moieties into bifunctional covalent organic framework enables reversible electron transfer to balance anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and cathodic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), thereby achieving efficient overall electrochemical overall CO2 reaction. 








Abstract
The electrochemical overall CO2 reduction involving concurrent CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) could realize energy conversion but still remains a grand challenge. Herein, a bifunctional cationic covalent organic framework (Vg&#8208;Por(Co)&#8208;COF) is constructed by the redox&#8208;active viologen unit and cobalt porphyrin building block to enhance the electrochemical CO2 overall reaction. The redox&#8208;active viologen moiety can switch from its original dicationic state to a neutral state, which could facilitate in transfer electron to the active center and enhance the cathodic CO2RR. While the anodic OER process, the viologen group can maintain its electron&#8208;deficient oxidation state, and induces the cobalt active center to a trivalent state, which is conducive to the occurrence of the OER. When Vg&#8208;Por(Co)&#8208;COF is employed as both cathodic and anodic catalysts, high CO Faradic efficiencies over 90% are achieved at 2.6 to 3.3&#160;V. The Vg&#8208;Por(Co)&#8208;COF || Vg&#8208;Por(Co)&#8208;COF system achieves a current density of 9.76&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 3.2&#160;V, outperforming both the Vg&#8208;Por(Co)&#8208;COF || Pt and the neutral COF electrocatalyst COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co || COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co systems under the same conditions. This work opens up a new avenue for exploring bifunctional materials toward efficient electrochemical CO2 overall reaction.

         <title>Supramolecular Mechanoluminescence via Fluorine Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we present a subtle supramolecular assembly strategy involving fluorine interactions that can effectively resolve the long&#8208;standing brightness&#8208;sensitivity&#8208;durability trade&#8208;off for organic mechanoluminescence (ML) systems, which results in bright, sensitive, durable ML emission. Meanwhile, a supramolecular host&#8208;guest system has been established that enables efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer across the visible spectrum.








Abstract
Mechanoluminescent (ML) materials, capable of converting mechanical stimuli directly into light emission without external excitation, hold great potential for use in sustainable optoelectronics and wearable technologies. However, the development of organic ML systems has long been limited by the trade&#8208;off among brightness, sensitivity, and mechanical durability. Here, we present a supramolecular assembly design that overcomes this trade&#8208;off by leveraging directional fluorine interactions, i.e., well&#8208;defined C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;F&#9472;C hydrogen&#8208;bonds and the rarely reported L&#8208;geometry C&#9472;F&#183;&#183;&#183;F&#9472;C contacts. The resulting supramolecular network stabilizes favorable molecular packing against mechanical damage while preserving optimal crystallinity, leading to bright and durable ML emission even during continuous mechanical grinding. Systematic structure&#8211;property analysis has successfully revealed the key design criteria for high&#8208;performance ML. We also establish a universal supramolecular platform that enables efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from the ML host to the ML&#8208;inactive luminophores across the visible spectrum (green, yellow, and red). Furthermore, the fabricated prototype supramolecular ML stress sensors exhibit remarkable sensitivity, with naked&#8208;eye&#8208;detectable ML at an ultralow impact force of 0.05&#160;N. This work has put forward that fluorine&#8208;driven supramolecular assembly is a robust and versatile design strategy for advanced organic ML materials.

         <title>Aromatic Pentaamide Macrocycles as High&#8208;Affinity Sulfate Binders and Efficient Transporters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocycles c5 exhibit high affinities for sulfate binding in organic solvents, which remain significant in water. Macrocycles c5a and c5b bearing hydrophobic side chains facilitate efficient and selective sulfate transport across bulk CHCl3 phases and lipid bilayers.








Abstract
The binding and transport of the highly hydrophilic sulfate ion pose a significant challenge. Receptors capable of both strong sulfate binding and efficient transport are rare. Macrocycles c5, featuring a constrained aromatic amide backbone that convergently locks multiple amide NH and phenyl NH donors, along with five large amide dipoles, create a preorganized, electropositive cavity that binds sulfate in a 1:1 stoichiometry, with affinities (Ka&#8217;s) from 108 to 1013 M&#8722;1 in solvents of low to high polarity. The water&#8208;soluble c5c binds sulfate, forming a 4:1 complex in aqueous solution. Macrocycles c5a and c5b with hydrophobic sidechains serve as carriers that mediate efficient sulfate transport across both a bulk chloroform phase and lipid bilayers. With their synthetic tunability, macrocycles c5 can be tailored to media of different properties, yielding effective sulfate binders and carriers with broad applicability.

Macrocycles &lt;b&gt;c5a&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;c5b&lt;/b&gt; with hydrophobic sidechains serve as carriers that mediate efficient sulfate transport across both a bulk chloroform phase and lipid bilayers. With their synthetic tunability, macrocycles &lt;b&gt;c5&lt;/b&gt; can be tailored to media of different properties, yielding effective sulfate binders and carriers with broad applicability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulating Electron&#8208;Transfer via Covalent Assembly Polyoxometalate with Photosensitizer for Efficient H2 Evolution and Tandem Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strongly&#8208;sensitized Ir&#8208;2 photosensitizer and a Co7 POM was covalent integration via Schiff&#8208;base chemistry, which can modulate electron transfer mechanism from reductive to oxidative quenching process. The Ir&#8208;2@Co7 assembly exhibits exceptional photocatalytic H2 evolution performance, demonstrating &#8764;18 and 253&#8208;fold enhancements compared to its physically mixed system and the Ir&#8208;1@Co7 assembly, respectively.








Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution efficiency is critically dependent on electron transfer between photosensitizers (PSs) and catalysts. Herein, covalent assembly of Ir&#8208;PSs with Co7 polyoxometalate was achieved via Schiff&#8208;base condensation to adjust electron transfer pathways, the resulting Ir&#8208;2@Co7 assembly exhibits a turnover number of 2280 for H2 evolution, &#8764;18 and &#8764;253 times higher than that of its physically mixture and Ir&#8208;1@Co7, respectively. Moreover, the generated H2 can drive tandem styrene hydrogenation under ambient conditions, achieving 99.9% ethylbenzene yield. Spectroscopic and thermodynamic analyses reveal that covalent linkage switches dominant quenching mechanism from reductive to oxidative, and dramatically enhances electron quenching rate constant by over two orders of magnitude from 2.54&#160;&#215;&#160;109 M&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in physical&#8208;mixed system to 5.87&#160;&#215;&#160;1011 M&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in the assembly. This work highlights the key role of covalent integration in promoting electron transfer, providing a general design principle for developing high&#8208;performance H2 evolution and tandem hydrogenation systems.

         <title>Aqueous and Surfactant&#8208;Free Synthesis of Nanoscale Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an aqueous, surfactant&#8208;free, and versatile synthesis method for imine&#8208;linked nanoCOFs incorporating porphyrin units, with tunable size and morphology. The resulting nanoCOFs exhibit excellent aqueous dispersibility, strong light absorption, and significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity.








Abstract
The synthesis of nanosized covalent organic frameworks (nanoCOFs) with good dispersibility is vital for optical and optoelectronic applications. However, conventional methods rely on surfactants and organic solvents, limiting scalability and water compatibility. Here, we report a facile, scalable, and surfactant&#8208;free strategy to synthesize imine&#8208;linked nanoCOFs incorporating porphyrin units in aqueous acetic acid. By tuning monomer and catalyst concentrations, we modulated polymerization kinetics to obtain highly crystalline nanoCOFs with controlled sizes (&#8764;50&#160;nm&#8211;5&#160;&#181;m), tunable morphologies (nanocubes, nanorods, nanofibers), and good dispersibility. Protonation of porphyrin units during synthesis introduced surface charges, preventing aggregation and enabling excellent water dispersibility. The nanoCOFs exhibited strong and broad light absorption along with high colloidal stability. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study demonstrated their remarkable photocatalytic activity for oxidative coupling of benzylamines in water, even at an ultra&#8208;low loading (0.0074&#160;mol%). This sustainable approach offers a versatile route to high&#8208;performance nanoCOFs, advancing COF&#8208;based photocatalysis and fundamental studies of their photophysical properties.

         <title>Facilitating the Construction of Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction via Accelerating the Hydrogen Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) profoundly regulates the performance of supported metal catalysts, but the conventional construction method, high&#8208;temperature reduction in H2, may sinter metal species. This work develops a universal strategy for promoting SMSI by accelerating the hydrogen catalysis kinetics. Through strategically introducing Pt single atoms, the SMSI formation temperature for Ru/TiO2 and Pd/TiO2 is decreased by 200&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) critically regulates the catalytic performance of supported metal catalysts. Conventionally, a high&#8208;temperature reduction (HTR) in H2 is required to construct this state, a process that involves H2 dissociation, spillover, and support activation. However, while a high temperature is indispensable to initiate SMSI, it also risks sintering the metal species, presenting a fundamental dilemma. Here, we demonstrate that this challenge can be overcome by accelerating the hydrogen catalysis kinetics through strategically manipulating active metal sites. As a proof of concept, by introducing Pt single atoms, the HTR temperature required to construct SMSI between Ru nanoparticles and TiO2 is reduced from 600 to 400&#160;&#176;C. The key is that the Pt sites substantially promote the hydrogen spillover from Ru to TiO2, which is inherently sluggish due to an over&#8208;strong Ru&#8211;H interaction. Both experimental and theoretical results confirm the accelerated support activation with the presence of Pt. The general effectiveness of this strategy is further validated by promoting SMSI formation in a Pd/TiO2 system. The results highlight the significant role catalysis plays in SMSI manipulation and provide deeper insights into the SMSI formation mechanism, which is vital to the advancement of supported metal catalysts and beyond.

         <title>Atomic Fe&#8210;P Pairs Eliminate H2O2 Migration Barriers for Sustainable Electro&#8208;Fenton Water Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>

The atomic&#8208;level pairing effectively overcomes the overlooked diffusion limitation of intermediate H2O2, leading to markedly improved electro&#8208;Fenton performance.








Abstract
The electro&#8208;Fenton process, involving O2 reduction to H2O2 and its subsequent activation into &#8226;OH, is an eco&#8208;friendly strategy for degrading organic pollutants in wastewater. Enhancing electro&#8208;Fenton efficiency necessitates two distinct functional sites: one for H2O2 generation to preserve the O&#8210;O bond and the other for activation to cleave the O&#8210;O bond. Despite extensive efforts to optimize these functions, the role of H2O2 migration between sites has been largely overlooked. Excessive inter&#8208;site distances can lead to sluggish H2O2 migration, making it a potential rate&#8208;limiting step in electro&#8208;Fenton catalysis. To address this challenge, we have developed Fe&#8210;P pairs at the atomic level, achieving the theoretical shortest site distance, with single&#8208;atom Fe acting as the H2O2 activation center and P in its first coordination shell facilitating H2O2 generation. Experimental and theoretical analyses revealed that Fe&#8210;P pairs significantly shortened the H2O2 diffusion time to &#8764;1.5&#160;ps, over 10 times faster than unpaired configurations, by reducing the migration distance, thereby improving the H2O2 utilization efficiency by over 4 times and enhancing electro&#8208;Fenton performance. Life cycle assessment further highlighted the low environmental impact of this approach, indicating its potential for large&#8208;scale wastewater treatment. By exploiting the previously neglected role of H2O2 migration, this study not only enhances our understanding of the electro&#8208;Fenton process but also offers new insights into the rational design of advanced electro&#8208;Fenton catalysts.

         <title>Coumarin&#8208;Based Volatile and Non&#8208;Volatile Solid Additives Enable Organic Solar Cells with 20.32% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two coumarin&#8208;derived volatile and non&#8208;volatile solid (non&#8208;VS) additives (named C5 and C6) were developed to optimize morphology and probe their different working mechanisms. Among them, the C6&#8208;treated binary organic solar cells (OSCs) achieved a record&#8208;high efficiency of 20.32% among the reported OSCs processed with small molecule non&#8208;VS additives.








Abstract
Solid additives, including volatile solid (VS) and non&#8208;volatile solid (non&#8208;VS) additives, have drawn great attention due to their crucial function in improving photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells (OSCs), while the post&#8208;treatment of non&#8208;VS additives is more convenient. However, compared with VS additives, non&#8208;VS additives often fall&#8208;short in optimizing device morphology, and their systematic comparisons in working mechanisms&#160;are still lacking. Herein, we design and synthesize two coumarin&#8208;derived additives, including volatile 7&#8208;(diethylamino)&#8208;2H&#8208;chromen&#8208;2&#8208;one (C5) and nonvolatile 3&#8208;(benzo[d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;7&#8208;(diethylamino)&#8208;2H&#8208;chromen&#8208;2&#8208;one (C6), to assess their various impacts on device performance. Both the C5&#8208; and C6&#8208;treated OSCs obtain optimized morphology, improved charge transfer, and less energy loss than the additive&#8208;free device, while C6 plays an additional charge transport channel to promote the exciton utilization through F&#246;ster&#8208;Reasonable energy transfer (FRET) between C6 and the donor. As a result, the OSC based on C6 treated D18:L8&#8208;BO obtained an impressive efficiency of 20.32%, as the highest value among the reported small molecule non&#8208;VS additive&#8208;treated devices, which is higher than those of additive&#8208;free (18.85%) and C5&#8208;treated (19.55%) ones. Our work provides a deep insight into the different mechanisms by which non&#8208;VS and VS additives boost photovoltaic performance of the resulting OSCs.

&lt;p&gt;Solid additives, including volatile solid (VS) and non-volatile solid (non-VS) additives, have drawn great attention due to their crucial function in improving photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells (OSCs), while the post-treatment of non-VS additives is more convenient.

Abstract
Reactions of the doubly reduced distannynes, [Ar&#8242;SnSnAr&#8242;M2], (Ar&#8242; = C6H3&#8208;2,6&#8208;Dipp; M = Li, Na, K), with the successively heavier group 1 elements (M&#8242;) result in reduction of M and the isolation of [Ar&#8242;SnSnAr&#8242;M&#8242;2]. Although the viability of these observations, along with the reversible formation of [Ar&#8242;SnSnAr&#8242;K2] by treatment of [Ar&#8242;SnSnAr&#8242;Rb2]&#160;with potassium, is successfully predicted by a combined theoretical and thermochemical analysis, assessment of the bonding within [Ar&#8242;SnSnAr&#8242;M2] suggests that any M+ ns valence orbital contribution should be too high in energy to effect M+ reduction. Based on a consideration of the Sn&#9472;Sn &#960; bonding and theoretical assessment of the resultant frontier orbitals, however, we suggest that the electron transfer necessary for M+ reduction, occurs intramolecularly and via a suitably disposed &#960;* SOMO of the putative radical anions, [Ar&#8242;SnSnAr&#8242;M2]&#8226;&#8722;.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Chiral Sulfinamidines via Asymmetric Amination of Sulfenamides Using a Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of chiral sulfinamidine was achieved with excellent efficiency and enantiocontrol through a CPA catalyzed enantioselective amination of sulfenamides at room temperature. This method features a broad substrate scope, mild conditions, and excellent functional group compatibility. The obtained sulfinamidines allow for further stereospecific elaborations to afford sulfinimidoyl fluoride, sulfonimidamide, and other aza&#8208;sulfur derivatives.








Abstract
Despite the significant applications of stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;sulfur compounds in pharmaceutical sciences and organic chemistry, efficient methods for precise construction of valuable chiral sulfinamidines remain limited. Herein, we disclosed a chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric strategy for the synthesis of chiral sulfinamidines through the direct amination of sulfenamides. This method demonstrated remarkable substrate scope and excellent yields and stereoselectivities across a diverse array of sulfinamidine compounds. The synthetic utility and practicability of this robust protocol were further highlighted through gram&#8208;scale reactions, product derivatization and late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural products and drugs.

         <title>Enhancing the Photocatalytic Reduction of O2 to H2O2 Through Proton Enrichment on Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effective enrichment of protons was achieved by constructing adjacent nitrogen sites on covalent organic frameworks, which promoted the photocatalytic reduction of O2 to generate H2O2.








Abstract
Increasing the concentration of reagents in chemical reactions is crucial for improving reaction rates. In this study, which focused on the O2 photocatalytic reduction as a model reaction, a targeted proton enrichment was achieved through the synergistic coordination of imine bonding and pyridazine functional groups in a covalent organic framework. This enhancement resulted in an increased supply of protons during O2 reduction, leading to the efficient photocatalytic production of H2O2. The adjacent distribution of nitrogen atoms provides sites for proton enrichment, and the maintenance of the stability of the protons on the catalyst surface is facilitated by moderate intermolecular forces, thus enabling protons to participate in the O2 reduction process. The specific reduction mode of the pyridazine functional group, whereby the adsorption of protons is followed by that of O2, has been shown to significantly enhance the transition from &#183;O2&#8722; to *OOH. The H2O2 yield was determined to be 12,100&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, exhibiting a solar chemical conversion efficiency of 2.15%, which is the highest observed value for photocatalysts in pure water. This study provides new insights for improving the efficiency of photocatalytic H2O2 production.

         <title>Dimeric Acceptor with Small Singlet&#8208;Triplet Energy Gap Enables Suppressed Triplet Loss and 20.85% Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report a dimeric acceptor, DY&#8208;TXT, with a TADF bridging unit. It features a small &#916;EST (&#8764;0.1&#160;eV), which suppresses triplet exciton loss and enables triplet recycling. The resulting ternary OSC achieves a low energy loss of 0.194&#160;eV and a high 20.85% efficiency.








Abstract
The relatively high non&#8208;radiative energy loss has become a major limiting factor for improving the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs), with triplet exciton formation being a primary source. Narrowing the energy gap between the first singlet and triplet excited states (&#916;EST) in low&#8208;bandgap acceptors is considered an effective strategy to mitigate this issue. In this work, we design and synthesize a dimeric acceptor, DY&#8208;TXT, utilizing a thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecule as the bridging unit. This novel structure exhibits a higher photoluminescence quantum yield and a significantly reduced &#916;EST (&#8764;0.1&#160;eV) compared to conventional nonfullerene acceptors. When incorporated into the D18:L8&#8208;BO host system, DY&#8208;TXT enhances the electroluminescence quantum efficiency and markedly suppresses triplet exciton generation, thereby reducing energy loss via triplet states. The small &#916;EST also facilitates reverse intersystem crossing process, enabling recycling of triplet excitons. Consequently, the resulting ternary device achieves a low non&#8208;radiative energy loss of 0.194&#160;eV and an outstanding power conversion efficiency of 20.85%. This work demonstrates an effective strategy for suppressing triplet&#8208;mediated energy losses and provides a promising avenue for advancing the performance of OSCs.

         <title>Axial Phosphate Coordination Driven Spin State Change in FeN4 Site for Stable Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>

Axial phosphate ligands (PO4) dynamically modulate FeN4 crystal field splitting and spin states, enhancing ORR activity and stability in Zn&#8208;air batteries.








Abstract
Understanding the structure&#8211;performance relationships of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) under realistic operating conditions remains a major challenge in electrocatalysis. In this study, axial phosphate groups (PO4) were introduced into the microenvironment of Fe single&#8208;atom sites embedded in cellulose&#8208;derived carbon (P&#8208;FeN4/CC), inducing a dynamic transformation of the crystal field from D4h to C4v and modulating the spin state through charge redistribution to better accommodate the catalytic reaction. The ligand&#8208;induced spin tunability combined with magnetic field&#8208;driven kinetic control enhances the intrinsic activity, selectivity, and stability for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The P&#8208;FeN4/CC catalyst demonstrates a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.97&#160;V, an ultra&#8208;high kinetic current density of 179.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 0.85&#160;V, and retains over 90.5% of its current after 136&#160;h, considerably outperforming Pt/C&#8208;20%. In practical applications, liquid zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) achieve a peak power density of 280.1&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and an impressive cycle life of 11,130 cycles (3,710&#160;h), while flexible ZABs deliver 81&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and operate stably for more than 160&#160;h. Theoretical calculations and in situ spectroscopy confirmed the critical role of axial PO4&#8208;induced modulation of Fe centers in enhancing ORR performance, offering new insights into the rational design of high&#8208;performance SACs.

         <title>Dynamic Li+ Respiration Effect Enables Cascade Conversion of Lithium Polysulfides for Li&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Li+&#8208;respiration&#8208;effect concept through tailoring the electrochemical&#8208;lithiation&#8208;tunable TiNb2O7 (TNO) catalyst is proposed to drive the cascade conversion of multiphase intermediates for Li&#8211;S batteries. By in situ potential modulation, LixTNO with dynamic active sites can automatically switch catalytic states to accelerate sulfur redox kinetics one&#8208;by&#8208;one. Li&#8211;S cells with LiTNO display enhanced cycling stability and wide temperature adaptability.








Abstract
High&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries exhibit obvious kinetics differences involving multistep reactions, making it hard to realize constantly high&#8208;efficient polysulfide conversion during the full charging/discharging Herein, we propose a concept of Li+&#8208;respiration&#8208;effect&#8208;induced cascade catalysis through taking full advantage of dynamic active sites from in situ potential&#8208;modulated TiNb2O7. The Li+ respiration effect activates the lattice O atom and regulates the antibonding orbitals filling, triggering an electrochemical&#8208;dominated switchable catalytic for sequential conversion of intermediates. As a result, the Li&#8211;S cell displays a good cycling stability and wide&#8208;temperature ability from &#8722;30 to +60&#160;&#176;C. A flexible pouch cell maintains a capacity retention of 94.6% after 120 cycles. Our discovery provides a fire&#8208;new perspective in electrochemically reconstructed catalysis for wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;tolerant Li&#160;&#8722;&#160;S batteries.

         <title>Harnessing Photoenzymatic Systems for Intermolecular C&#8211;H Fluorination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the remarkable versatility of enzymes for catalyzing complex organic transformations under mild aqueous conditions, no biocatalytic system has been reported for intermolecular C&#8211;H fluorination. A radical photoenzymatic approach is introduced that leverages a designed de novo protein scaffold with an unnatural amino acid to achieve precise benzylic monofluorination by a hydrogen atom transfer mechanism.








Abstract
Organofluorine compounds are vital in pharmaceuticals, and enzymes, nature's most efficient catalysts, offer tremendous potential for precise fluorination. However, no enzymatic strategies for intermolecular C&#8211;H fluorination have been realized&#8212;until now. We present the first radical photoenzymatic system enabling intermolecular C&#8211;H fluorination using an unnatural amino acid within a robust de novo protein scaffold. This system achieves chemoselective benzylic monofluorination in aqueous solutions with Selectfluor, driven by hydrogen atom transfer from the photoexcited amino acid. It successfully fluorinated various aromatic compounds and enabled biosynthesis of fluorinated polyketides and chiral fluorinated alcohols. These results establish radical photoenzymatic systems as a powerful new approach for efficient, selective biocatalytic fluorination, with direct relevance to pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Isolation of Germyliumylidene&#8208;Stabilized Heteronuclear Transition Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report the synthesis of a germyliumylidene&#8208;embedded monoanionic species exhibiting ambiphilic reactivity toward nucleophilic and electrophilic metal complexes. Subsequent reactions with metalates allow access to heterobimetallic complexes featuring Au&#9472;M (M&#9552;Mn, Co, W) bonds, demonstrating the capability of the germyliumylidene as an ancillary supporting ligand.








Abstract
Heterobimetallic complexes featuring heavier tetrylenes and tetryliumylidenes are scarce due to their limited stabilization capability stemming from the inert pair effect. Herein, we report that the incorporation of a chlorogermyliumylidene into a dianionic B6 cluster&#8208;based diphosphine ligand allows access to the germyliumylidene&#8208;containing unit carrying a monoanionic charge. This molecule exhibits ambiphilic reactivity toward nucleophilic KFeCp(CO)2 and electrophilic AuCl&#183;SMe2, rendering the iron&#8208;substituted germyliumylidene and inorganic macrocycle via molecular self&#8208;assembly, respectively. The latter is found to serve as a precursor, by reacting with metalates, for the construction of heterobimetallic complexes featuring Au&#9472;M (M&#9552;Mn, Co, W) bonds. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and computational studies elucidate that those heterobimetallic fragments are stabilized by s&#8208;donation from the Ge atom, demonstrating the capability of the germyliumylidene as an ancillary supporting ligand.

&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report the synthesis of a germyliumylidene-embedded monoanionic species exhibiting ambiphilic reactivity toward nucleophilic and electrophilic metal complexes. Subsequent reactions with metalates allow access to heterobimetallic complexes featuring Au&#9472;M (M&#9552;Mn, Co, W) bonds, demonstrating the capability of the germyliumylidene as an ancillary supporting ligand.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heterobimetallic complexes featuring heavier tetrylenes and tetryliumylidenes are scarce due to their limited stabilization capability stemming from the inert pair effect. Herein, we report that the incorporation of a chlorogermyliumylidene into a dianionic B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; cluster-based diphosphine ligand allows access to the germyliumylidene-containing unit carrying a monoanionic charge. This molecule exhibits ambiphilic reactivity toward nucleophilic KFeCp(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and electrophilic AuCl&#183;SMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, rendering the iron-substituted germyliumylidene and inorganic macrocycle via molecular self-assembly, respectively. The latter is found to serve as a precursor, by reacting with metalates, for the construction of heterobimetallic complexes featuring Au&#9472;M (M&#9552;Mn, Co, W) bonds.

         <title>Patching Solid Electrolyte Interphase via Modulating Anion Decomposition Reactions for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulating the decomposition reactions of bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide anion (FSI&#8722;) by increasing the overpotential of anodes is proposed to rapidly patch fractured solid electrolyte interphase. This approach promotes the rapid and complete decomposition of FSI&#8722;, thereby reducing the accumulation of inactive lithium compounds.








Abstract
Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on lithium (Li) metal anodes undergoes repeated rupture and patching during cycles, which induces the formation of inactive Li and the rapid failure of Li metal batteries. The inactive Li compounds used to patch SEI dominate inactive Li for highly reversible Li metal anodes. Herein, patching SEI rapidly by modulating decomposition reactions of bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide anion (FSI&#8722;) in the electrolyte is proposed to decrease the amount of inactive Li compounds. Increasing overpotential of anodes can promote the fast and complete decomposition reactions of FSI&#8722;, which increases the amount of insoluble inorganic components in the decomposition products of one FSI&#8722;. Abundant insoluble inorganic components can build SEI efficiently to avoid the further decomposition of the electrolyte. Then, a protocol is proposed to increase overpotential of anodes by applying a high current density within a short time during the final stage of Li deposition in Li metal batteries. With the proposed protocol, the amount of inactive Li compounds decreases by 62.2%. Furthermore, a prototype pouch cell of 411 Wh kg&#8722;1 achieves 202 stable cycles. This work provides a fresh understanding of SEI formation and inspires a new strategy to stabilize SEI.

         <title>Accessing Molecular Complexity from Methane and Other Gaseous Alkanes via Photocatalytic Cascade Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron&#8208;catalyzed protocol for the cascade cyclization of N&#8208;aryl and N&#8208;benzoyl acrylamides promoted by methane and other gaseous alkanes is reported. The current protocol provides an efficient platform for the conversion of feedstock gaseous alkanes into complex and medicinally relevant N&#8208;heterocycles.








Abstract
The direct transformation of simple and abundant feedstocks into structurally complex molecules remains a central challenge in modern organic synthesis. Herein, we report a method for the oxidative cascade cyclization of N&#8208;aryl and N&#8208;benzoyl acrylamide derivatives, promoted by methane and other gaseous alkanes. This transformation is enabled by a readily available iron catalyst in combination with N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) as the oxidant, proceeding under mild conditions to afford a diverse array of N&#8208;heterocyclic frameworks in high yields. Late&#8208;stage functionalization studies highlight the utility of methane in the synthesis of biologically relevant scaffolds. Moreover, the Fe/NFSI system facilitates a radical sampling regime that enables the selective functionalization of less reactive primary C&#9472;H bonds. Overall, this work establishes a sustainable and versatile platform for constructing molecular complexity directly from gaseous alkanes.

         <title>Facile Introduction of Quantum Confinement in Linear Conjugated Polymers for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
By stabilizing Linear conjugated polymers into their entangled state before bulkification, we achieve a high&#8208;yield nanoscale morphology, thus bypassing exfoliation. This structure introduces quantum confinement characteristics that, in turn, modify the optical absorption profile, enhance hydrophilicity, and ultimately lead to improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rates.








Abstract
While the structurally tunable nature of Linear conjugated polymers (Linear CPs) offers promising opportunities for advancing photocatalysts, their current fabrication methods predominantly yield particles or bulk materials, significantly hindering the full exploitation of their catalytic potential. In this study, we demonstrate that the inherent entangled state of Linear CPs can be retained before bulk formation, leading to enhanced catalytic performance. Without exfoliation or modified synthesis, the entangled Linear CPs displayed a quantum confinement effect, leading to blue&#8208;shifted absorption and emission along with improved carrier separation efficiency. The entangled P28&#8208;E exhibits a photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rates (HERs) of 42.8 mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1, which is 28 times higher than that of its bulk counterpart (P28&#8208;S). A notable trend was observed in the HERs. A notable order shift occurred from P28&#8208;S&#160;&lt;&#160;TpPz&#8208;COF, PBT&#8208;S, P7&#8208;S in the bulk to P28&#8208;E&#160;&gt;&#160;TpPz&#8208;COF, PBT&#8208;E, P7&#8208;E in the entangled state. This work not only presents an effective approach toward efficient photocatalytic water splitting, but also provides new insights into exploring potential microscopic features of Linear CPs.

         <title>Intact Proteoform Analysis by Capillary Electrophoresis&#8211;Mass Spectrometry. Are We There Yet?</title>

Mass spectrometry (MS) and top&#8211;down proteomics (TDP) have emerged as powerful tools to decipher proteoform&#8208;level information, advancing biological insight and translational research. This study unites leaders in capillary electrophoresis (CE) and MS from multiple institutions across the globe to showcase the reproducibility, unique information, and predictability of CE&#8208;MS for TDP analysis for a diverse set of platforms.








Abstract
Mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based top&#8211;down proteomics (TDP) has emerged as a powerful tool for characterizing proteoforms to advance both fundamental and translational research. TDP requires high&#8208;efficiency liquid&#8208;phase separation, high&#8208;resolution MS, and tandem MS. Capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE)&#8208;MS has been proposed as a promising analytical technique for protein analysis decades ago because of its unique and valuable features, including high separation efficiency and high detection sensitivity. However, CZE&#8208;MS has not been widely adopted by the proteomics community, mainly due to concerns with its robustness and reproducibility. Here, we hypothesized that CZE&#8208;MS is sufficiently robust and reproducible for broad adoption due to the continued efforts of the community over the last three decades. In this work, for the first time, research teams from around the world validated the robustness, repeatability, and reproducibility of CZE&#8208;MS for TDP in both simple and complex model proteoform mixtures employing a full spectrum of commercially available capillary electrophoresis (CE)&#8208;MS interfaces, instrumentation, and compared CZE&#8208;MS performance with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art liquid chromatography (LC)&#8208;MS methods. This study offers the research community an informative resource of ready&#8208;to&#8208;use experimental CE&#8208;MS techniques and a better understanding of the CZE&#8208;MS approach and its potential in TDP, accelerating the broad adoption of CZE&#8208;MS in proteoform research.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Directed in Situ Stacking Modulation of 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks for Selective Separation of Xylene Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stacking mode of 2D COFs can be in situ tuned by varying reaction solvents, enabling selective formation of eclipsed (AA) or staggered (AB) arrangements. This solvent&#8208;driven control highlights the dynamic nature of COF assembly and yields AA&#8208;stacked frameworks with enhanced xylene separation performance.








Abstract
The precise regularity of stacking modes in two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) remains insufficiently understood, and achieving precise control during synthesis is highly challenging. Here, we show that the interlayer stacking arrangement can be in situ modulated simply by varying the reaction solvent, allowing the selective formation of either eclipsed (AA) or staggered (AB) stacking. This direct solvent&#8208;driven regulation, achieved without post&#8208;synthetic modification, underscores the dynamic nature of COF assembly. Notably, the AA&#8208;stacked COF exhibits promising separation performance for xylene isomers compared to its AB&#8208;stacked counterpart.

         <title>Some Like It Hot &#8211;Structural Changes in Extremophile Rubredoxin at 120 &#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reveal the high temperature crystal structure of a hyperthermophilic (Pyrococcus furiosus) rubredoxin at 393&#160;K (120 &#176;C), together with multiple complementary structures down to 100&#160;K. The results are compared with molecular dynamics calculations. Significant changes in H&#8208;bonding are observed. Discussions about high&#8208;temperature protein structure and stability need to recognize that low temperature structures may not represent the high temperature case.








Abstract
How does the structure of a protein change as the temperature is raised from cryogenic conditions at 100&#160;K to 393 K? Understanding the structure and dynamics of proteins under environmental extremes is relevant for human health, biotechnological applications, and our search for life elsewhere in the universe. Here we reveal the high temperature crystal structure of a hyperthermophilic (Pyrococcus furiosus) rubredoxin at 393&#160;K (120 &#176;C), together with multiple complementary structures down to 100&#160;K. The results are compared with molecular dynamics calculations. Significant changes in H&#8208;bonding are observed.

         <title>Cross&#8208;Shaped Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Acceptor Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Push&#8211;Pull Architectures for Effective Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>

         <dc:description>
A cross&#8208;shaped donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor topology is constructed via TCNQ&#8208;based framework design, and further refined through post&#8208;synthetic conversion of cyano groups into N&#8208;heterocycles. This multilevel D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8242;&#8208;D1 architecture enables multidirectional charge transport and enhanced exciton dissociation, offering a tunable molecular platform for COF&#8208;based photocatalysts beyond conventional linear COFs.








Abstract
Efficient photocatalysts for H2O2 production are pivotal for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion. However, their performance remains limited by inefficient charge separation and rapid electron&#8211;hole recombination. Rational molecular design is therefore essential to enhance intrinsic charge&#8208;separation driving forces and establish efficient transport pathways. Herein, a TCNQ&#8208;based covalent organic framework (TCNQ&#8208;COF) featuring a rare cross&#8208;shaped donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor fragment was constructed by integrating electron&#8208;deficient TCNQ and electron&#8208;rich triphenylene into a conjugated backbone, achieving multidirectional charge&#8208;transfer pathways. Post&#8208;synthetic transformation of the cyano groups into electron&#8208;withdrawing heterocycles (pyrazole or pyrimidine, A&#697;), when combined with triphenylene (D) and amino groups (D1), yielded two novel COFs (Pz&#8208;COF, Pym&#8208;COF) with multilevel cross&#8208;shaped D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#697;&#8208;D1 architectures. This sophisticated push&#8211;pull system enables gradient&#8208;tuning of donor&#8211;acceptor interactions, thereby promoting efficient charge separation and carrier mobility. Among them, Pz&#8208;COF exhibits the highest H2O2 production rate (7613&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Spectroscopic and theoretical analyses further reveal a synergistic effect between acceptor strength and donor diversity in regulating intramolecular charge behavior. The proposed cross&#8208;shaped D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A and its multilevel D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8242;&#8208;D1 architectures overcome the limitations of conventional linear motifs, offering a blueprint for the development of advanced photocatalytic COFs.

         <dc:description>
This study develops a novel fluorescent NO2 sensor using a newl fabricated &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked COF membrane. It shows ultrafast response/recovery (1.5&#160;s/2.0&#160;s), high selectivity, a 0.1&#160;ppm detection limit, and stability over 5000 tests. Its practical use is proven by real&#8208;time monitoring of vehicle exhaust and waste incineration emissions, enabled by its porous, electron&#8208;rich structure.








Abstract
Developing compact and structurally simple sensors for reliable and rapid monitoring of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) remains a challenge. In this study, we synthesized a novel &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked 4&#160;+&#160;3 covalent organic framework (COF) membrane with unique topology structure using tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)ethene (ETTA) and 1,3,5&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol (TP) as monomers through liquid&#8208;liquid interfacial polymerization. The sensitive NO2 response of the ETTA&#8208;TP COF membrane enables the creation of the first and high&#8208;performance NO2 film&#8208;based fluorescent sensor, achieving fastest response/recovery time (1.5 s/2.0&#160;s) and a high selectivity (over 16 potential interferents). This sensor realizes a low detection limit of 0.1&#160;ppm and a broad detection range from 0.1 to 50&#160;ppm, while maintaining stable performance over 5000 continuous tests. Furthermore, it demonstrates on&#8208;site, real&#8208;time monitoring of NO2 emissions from automotive exhaust and waste incineration. The sensing mechanism studies reveal that the carbonyl groups of &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine structure can bind NO2 via electrostatic interactions and undergoes an energy&#8208;level&#8208;matching photoinduced electron transfer process under photoexcitation. The responses of other carbonyl&#8208;containing fluorescent molecules and COF materials to NO2 corroborate the generality of this mechanism. This study offers valuable insights into the development of oxidizing gas sensors characterized by fast response time, high sensitivity, and robust in situ online monitoring capabilities.

         <title>Biocatalytic Atroposelective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Styrenes via Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Identification and protein engineering on an imine reductase (IRED) for both (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;selective synthesis of nonbiaryl amine atropisomers via dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) have been achieved. Enantiocomplementary ADHs were also identified to catalyze the reductive DKR processes. The axially chiral styrenes were produced in high atroposelectivity and yields with broad substrate scope.








Abstract
Enzymatic synthesis of atropisomers has recently attracted considerable research attention, with most studies focusing on axially chiral biaryls. We report a less explored atroposelective dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of nonbiaryl styrenes catalyzed by imine reductases (IREDs) and alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs). The IR189 wild type enzyme was identified to be highly active and selective; furthermore, the inversion of atroposelectivity was achieved with protein engineering. Additionally, two ADHs with enantio&#8208;complementary selectivity for the reductive DKR were identified and applied in the synthesis of axially chiral styrenes. Both IREDs and ADHs exhibited broad substrate scope, affording up to 99:1 e.r. and 99% yields for up to 29 examples. Scaled&#8208;up reactions and derivatization of optically pure products demonstrated the synthetic utility of these axially chiral styrenes. Molecular recognition mechanisms were elucidated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The current strategy expands the scope of enzymatic DKR of atropisomeric compounds and significantly advances the field of biocatalytic synthesis of axially chiral compounds.

         <title>Unlocking Durable and Efficient Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electrocatalysis via Interface&#8208;Stabilized Trivalent Cobalt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have demonstrated that the interface electric field at the CoOOH/(CoxSn1&#8208;x)3O4 junction could stabilize the critical low&#8208;spin Co3+ (t2g6eg0) active centers, thereby enabling highly durable nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia even under high&#8208;current&#8208;density operation.








Abstract
Although cobalt&#8208;based materials are promising catalysts for electrochemical nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia reduction, achieving stable operation at high current densities remains challenging due to significant overpotential issues. To address this, we engineered a CoOOH/(CoxSn1&#8208;x)3O4 assembly to stabilize low&#8208;spin Co3+ (t2g6eg0) active centers, enabling highly durable performance under high current density operation. Sn doping in the underlying (CoxSn1&#8208;x)3O4 strengthens the stability of Co3+ within the CoOOH catalytic layer by inducing an interfacial electric field at the CoOOH/(CoxSn1&#8208;x)3O4 junction. This field promotes electron transfer from Co3+ species in CoOOH to (CoxSn1&#8208;x)3O4, thereby stabilizing the critical Co3+ active centers during high&#8208;current operation. The enhanced interfacial electric field arises from the higher electronegativity of Sn4+ (1.706) compared to Co3+ (1.693). Consequently, the CoOOH/(CoxSn1&#8208;x)3O4 catalyst achieves a remarkable Faradaic efficiency of 96.7% for NH4+ generation at &#8722;0.3&#160;V versus RHE (110&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and demonstrates exceptional long&#8208;term stability for 1000 h at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This work demonstrates that creating an interface electric field is an efficient strategy to stabilize electroreduction active centers at high currents.

         <title>Suppressing Non&#8208;Radiative Decay via Cyanation: A Promising Design Strategy for Bright Organic NIR&#8208;II Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A peripheral cyanation strategy was developed to resolve the intrinsic trade&#8208;off among absorption wavelength, light&#8208;harvesting efficiency, and emission intensity in conventional donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) NIR&#8208;II fluorophores, enabling in vivo perfusion assessment, vascular and lymphatic imaging, and precise fluorescence guidance for tumor resection.








Abstract
Achieving high fluorescence efficiency in organic fluorophores within the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8764;1700&#160;nm) remains challenging, as extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and active intramolecular motions typically funnel excitation energy into non&#8208;radiative decay. Here, we present peripheral cyanation as a molecular design strategy that directly modulates excited&#8208;state dynamics and suppresses non&#8208;radiative relaxation. Incorporation of cyano groups (A') into the D&#8208;A&#8208;D scaffold of BBTCz afforded BBTCzCN with an A&#8217;&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8217; architecture, which significantly reduced vibronic coupling compared to the parent dye. Upon encapsulation with DSPE&#8208;mPEG5000, BBTCzCN nanoparticles (NPs) retained a high FLQY of 2.8% with a record&#8208;high brightness of 565&#160;M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1, representing a 10.4&#8208;fold enhancement over BBTCz NPs and placing it among the brightest organic NIR&#8208;II emitters reported to date. Mechanistic studies combining density functional theory and ultrafast spectroscopy revealed that cyanation synergistically suppressed vibrational relaxation and internal conversion, thereby prolonging radiative decay pathways. As a result, BBTCzCN NPs enabled high&#8208;resolution vascular imaging, real&#8208;time lymphatic tracking, and precise intraoperative delineation of tumors and peritoneal metastases. This work establishes peripheral cyanation as a broadly applicable molecular design strategy for tailoring excited&#8208;state decay pathways, advancing the development of next&#8208;generation NIR&#8208;II fluorophores for deep&#8208;tissue imaging and image&#8208;guided surgery.

         <title>Giant Cycloparaphenylene&#8208;Scaffolded Porphyrins as Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Giant porphyrin&#8208;CPP conjugates were synthesized from the iodinated CPP precursors. These conjugates exhibit high photocatalytic performance in the cycloaddition of tertiary anilines with maleimides, achieving high yields and broad substrate scope. Their superior activity over benchmark catalysts stems from the unique 3D CPP scaffold that suppresses &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and promotes efficient generation of 1O2/O2&#183;&#8722; via loose packing of porphyrin units.








Abstract
The efficient synthesis of cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) with the designated functional groups still remains challenging. Meanwhile, the applications of functional CPPs have received increasing attention. In this paper, we first present a staged macrocyclization and TMS&#8208;I exchange strategy for the precise synthesis of [12]CPP&#8208;8I, while a direct three&#8208;fold macrocyclization of a diiodo&#8208;terphenyl precursor yields [9]CPP&#8208;6I in 39% yield. These results not only provide reliable routes to iodinated CPPs, but also reveal the influence of ring size on their chemical reactivity. Second, we further synthesized the giant porphyrin&#8208;CPP conjugates [12]CPP&#8208;8tBu3TPP and [9]CPP&#8208;6tBu3TPP from the respective iodinated precursors via Suzuki coupling with the porphyrin boronic ester. The unique 3D structure of the CPP scaffold can weaken intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and favor the intermolecular loose packing of porphyrin units, ushering in generating 1O2 and O2&#183;&#8722; with high efficiency under light irradiation in DMF. Third, the giant porphyrin&#8208;CPP conjugates, in particular [9]CPP&#8208;6tBu3TPP, were demonstrated to be efficient photocatalysts for the photochemical reaction between tertiary aniline and maleimide with high yield and wide substrate scope, significantly outperforming porphyrins and other benchmark catalysts reported previously. Furthermore, the utility of [9]CPP&#8208;6tBu3TPP as the photocatalyst for developing photoinduced polymerization was explored.

These results not only provide reliable routes to iodinated CPPs, but also reveal the influence of ring size on their chemical reactivity. Second, we further synthesized the giant porphyrin-CPP conjugates [12]CPP-8&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;TPP and [9]CPP-6&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;TPP from the respective iodinated precursors via Suzuki coupling with the porphyrin boronic ester. The unique 3D structure of the CPP scaffold can weaken intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and favor the intermolecular loose packing of porphyrin units, ushering in generating &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#183;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; with high efficiency under light irradiation in DMF. Third, the giant porphyrin-CPP conjugates, in particular [9]CPP-6&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;TPP, were demonstrated to be efficient photocatalysts for the photochemical reaction between tertiary aniline and maleimide with high yield and wide substrate scope, significantly outperforming porphyrins and other benchmark catalysts reported previously. Furthermore, the utility of [9]CPP-6&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;TPP as the photocatalyst for developing photoinduced polymerization was explored.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrastable Implanting&#8208;Structured Catalyst for Long&#8208;Lasting Acidic CO2 Electrolysis with Industrial&#8208;Level Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An implanting&#8208;structured catalyst is developed for acidic CO2 electrolysis, featuring full anchoring of metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) within zeolite crystals and strong resistance to undesirable self&#8208;reduction derived from a unique electron shielding effect. A record&#8208;high stability of sustaining HCOOH Faradaic efficiency (FE) over 94% for 500 h and a remarkable partial current density of 865&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1 A cm&#8722;2 are achieved in strong acids.








Abstract
Acidic electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) holds promise for high CO2 utilization. However, corrosive and reductive acidic electrolytes typically cause catalyst degradation and undesirable self&#8208;reduction. In this study, we strategically design an implanting&#8208;structured catalyst encompassing Bi2O3 nanoparticles (NPs) core within zeolite crystals through a novel stepwise seed&#8208;directed crystallization technique. This design potently inhibits the dissolution, detachment, agglomeration and reshaping of NPs during acidic CO2RR and precisely controls NP size to offer high&#8208;density active sites per unit area. The concomitant strong metal oxide&#8208;support interaction induces the electron shielding effect, which drives electrons unidirectionally exported from Bi to *OCHO intermediate and zeolite but prevents the electron inflow to Bi, preventing the working Bi2O3 from self&#8208;reduction during acidic CO2RR. Meanwhile, the interfacial electron transfer steers the CO2RR intermediates coverage by enhancing *OCHO intermediate stabilization and weakening *H binding. This innovative catalyst has been effectively utilized in acidic CO2 electrolysis, attaining a maximum HCOOH Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 99% and a remarkable partial current density of 865&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1 A cm&#8722;2, particularly achieving extraordinary stability &#8211; sustain FE exceeding 94% for 500 hours in strongly acidic media. This work opens up new opportunities of ultrastable implanting&#8208;structured catalyst for long&#8208;lasting acidic CO2 electrolysis and other catalytic systems.

         <title>Double&#8208;Cyclized Dipeptides for Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly Into Crystalline Macroscopic Superhelices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral macrocycle embedded with cyclodipeptides can construct macroscopic superhelical structures. The electron&#8208;rich aromatic regions of the macrocycle interact with the fluorescent guests through host&#8211;guest interaction, achieving efficient chirality transfer in both ground and excited states.








ABSTRACT
Cyclic peptides have attracted significant attentiondue to their persistent structures and particular biological effects, which are also key building blocks for creating functional chiral materials. Here, we report a double&#8208;cyclized dipeptide structure&#8212;a macrocycle embedded with a cyclic dipeptide&#8212;and its use in constructing superhelical structures. By further cyclizing modified cyclic diphenylalanine, a macrocyclic arene embedded with a cyclodipeptide was synthesized. Its unique, rigid structure allows to give hierarchical helical structures by bottom&#8208;up assembly process in solution. These superhelical structures are macroscopic, reaching lengths of at centimeter scale. This demonstrates a bottom&#8208;up, multiscale transfer of chirality from the molecular to the macroscopic scale. Moreover, assembly patterns can be precisely controlled by adjusting kinetic conditions such as temperature, concentration, enantiomeric ratio, and solvent, allowing for both rigid and flexible arrangement modalities. The presence of the macrocycle in these superhelices enables the encapsulation of cationic dyes, leading to both ground&#8208;state and excited&#8208;state chirality transfer. This provides a valuable template for designing macroscopic chiroptical materials.

         <title>Engineering Fluoroacetate Dehalogenase by Growth&#8208;Based Selections on Non&#8208;Natural Organofluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a high&#8208;throughput selection system to engineer fluoroacetate dehalogenases (FAcDs). By challenging E. coli populations that produce diverse FAcD libraries to grow on non&#8208;natural organofluorides as their sole carbon source, we isolated a panel of FAcD variants with improved activity and altered substrate specificity.








ABSTRACT
The widespread use of organofluorides in modern society has inadvertently led to the bioaccumulation of harmful pollutants, most prominently per&#8208; and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS). In principle, tailored biocatalysts able to cleave C&#9472;F bonds represent an attractive strategy to combat this (emerging) environmental crisis. However, Nature is largely impartial to C&#9472;F bonds, with fluoroacetate dehalogenases (FAcDs) standing out by catalyzing the hydrolysis of single C&#9472;F bonds in fluoroacetate at high turnover rates. To harness its catalytic prowess for non&#8208;natural organofluorides, we designed and applied a robust growth&#8208;based selection strategy for large&#8208;scale FAcD engineering. Specifically, we demonstrate that FAcD&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;F bond cleavage of (natural and) synthetic organofluorides generates metabolizable carbon sources for bacteria, enabling in vivo enrichment of active FAcD variants. By forcing populations expressing diverse FAcD&#8208;libraries to utilize various organofluorides as sole carbon source, we elicited a panel of FAcD variants with improved activities and altered substrate profiles for fluoroacetate, 2&#8208;fluoropropionate, and 2,2&#8208;difluoroacetate. In these efforts, we also identified a previously overlooked inhibition pathway, which impedes the conversion of gem&#8208;difluoride compounds. Overall, our study presents the first large&#8208;scale engineering campaign of FAcDs and introduces an operationally simple selection platform to adapt these enzymes for the sustainable degradation of contaminating organofluorides.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Allylation of Alkynylboronates to Access Chiral 1,4&#8208;Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We here reported an iridium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective allylation reaction with allylic electrophiles and alkynyl boronates, resulting in various 1,4&#8208;dienes with excellent Z/E ratios and enantioselectivity. The reaction proceeds through a concerted mechanism that involves an allylation&#8208;induced 1,2&#8208;migration of the alkynyl boronate, followed by a syn&#8208;addition of the migrating group and Ir(&#960;&#8208;allyl) complex across the alkynyl fragment.








ABSTRACT
Skipped dienes, particularly 1,4&#8208;dienes, play significant roles in pharmaceuticals and organic synthesis as they serve as key intermediates for the construction of complex structures and also bioactive molecules. However, the catalytic assembly of this motif with high stereoselectivity from readily available starting materials remains a substantial synthetic challenge. Herein, we reported a direct iridium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective allylation reaction with allylic electrophiles and alkynyl boronates, resulting in various 1,4&#8208;dienes with excellent Z/E ratios and enantioselectivity. The reaction proceeds through a concerted mechanism that involves an allylation&#8208;induced 1,2&#8208;migration of the alkynyl boronate, followed by a syn&#8208;addition of the migrating group and Ir(&#960;&#8208;allyl) complex across the alkynyl fragment to selectively deliver the more challenging Z&#8208;alkenes. DFT calculations clarify the origins of the observed high chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivity. Furthermore, this method demonstrates a broad substrate scope, and the resulting enantiomerically enriched 1,4&#8208;diene products can be readily derivatized.

         <title>Programmable Anisotropic in Diazapyrene Cocrystals With Birefringence Exceeding 1.2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of diazapyrene&#8208;based crystals have been developed through N&#8208;containing regulation and cocrystal engineering, which can be programmed to tune &#8710;n values from 0.152 to 1.269 at 546 nm. Based on these results, a novel Boltzmann distribution model was proposed to predict high &#916;n values in organic conjugated crystals.








ABSTRACT
Birefringent crystals underpin polarization control and angular phase matching in nonlinear optics and therefore, attract sustained interest. However, achieving large birefringence (&#916;n) has largely depended on inorganic frameworks composed of metals with limited natural abundance or sustainability concerns. By contrast, organic cocrystals offer simple preparation and readily tunable packing. Here we design a series of diazapyrene derivatives and obtain 13 crystals, including three single&#8208;component crystals and ten two&#8208;component cocrystals formed separately with three distinct benzene derivatives, whose crystal&#8208;packing anisotropy can be programmed to yield &#916;n&#160;=&#160;0.152&#8211;1.269. Two compositions, D27N and D13N, combine suitable optical band gaps with exceptional birefringence (&#916;n = 1.223 and 1.269 at 546 nm, respectively), ranking among the highest reported for purely organic crystals, and under identical conditions, surpassing all reported inorganic birefringent crystals. Across the series, we uncover a Boltzmann&#8208;type relationship between &#916;n and a geometric descriptor &#916;S (minimal/maximal projected area of the conjugated core on crystallographic planes), thereby quantitatively linking molecular&#8208;level packing anisotropy to macroscopic &#916;n. Cocrystal engineering also modulates second&#8208;order nonlinear optical responses, including symmetry control and second&#8208;harmonic generation tuning. This work establishes a metal&#8208;free, designable route to high&#8208;&#916;n optical crystals and provides a predictive metric for anisotropy&#8208;driven materials discovery.

         <title>Spatial Molecular Engineering of Hole Semiconductors Enables Record Efficiency and Durability in Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatial molecular engineering endows hole&#8208;transporting materials with comprehensively optimized performances, leading to inverted PSCs with a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.6% and exceptional operational stability.








ABSTRACT
Conventional small&#8208;molecule hole&#8208;transporting materials (SM&#8208;HTMs), although morphologically robust, typically suffer from limited hole mobility, interfacial energy misalignment, and inefficient charge extraction, which collectively hinder power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) above 25% in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, breaking from conventional design paradigm, novel spatial molecular engineering was targeted proposed for SM&#8208;HTMs to overcome inherent limitations while reinforcing advantages. By spatially exposing the functional heterocyclic core to release its full potential, the tailored WH13 dramatically enhances the perovskite/HTM interfacial interactions, promotes crystallization, and facilitates hole extraction. More importantly, the resultant planar&#8208;steric architecture enables long&#8208;range &#960;&#8208;stacking order while supporting nanocrystal&#8208;level film&#8208;formation, thereby achieving an optimal balance between charge transport dynamics and morphological features. Consequently, WH13&#8208;based inverted PSCs achieve a champion PCE of 26.6% (certified 26.24%) with exceptional operational stability (&gt;99%, ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1 500&#160;h), representing the highest efficiency reported to date for SM&#8208;HTM&#8208;based PSCs. This spatial molecular engineering strategy establishes a generalizable design paradigm for next&#8208;generation HTMs, opening a promising pathway toward high&#8208;performance, operationally stable, and commercially viable PSCs.

         <title>Stereospecific Assembly of Triply Chiral Pseudopeptidic Cages Through Dynamic Dual Chirality Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spontaneous assembly of triply chiral (L, &#916;, P or D, &#923;, M) cages has been achieved from a simple tripodal chiral effector based on phenylalanine tris(amidoamine), non&#8208;chiral bipyridine dialdehyde, and a metal ion. Orthogonal imine bond and iron (II) coordination generate a single combination of chiral elements, while configurationally stable ruthenium (II) allows their stereospecific selection, reflecting a highly efficient dynamic chiral information transfer.








ABSTRACT
A stereospecific transmission of chiral information within tripodal pseudopeptidic cages has been observed from dynamic constitutional co&#8208;operation of reversible orthogonal processes: imine bond and metal coordination. The chiral centers from the phenylalanine amino acid moieties induce a specific chirality into the formed octahedral Fe(II) complex and into the helical twist of the macrobicycle, as confirmed by NMR, circular dichroism, X&#8208;ray diffraction of single crystals, and theoretical calculations. Instead, when a configurationally stable Ru(II) complex is employed, the dynamic imine exchange efficiently selects the corresponding matched&#8208;combination of the same chiral elements, leading after reduction to a water&#8208;soluble homochiral stable macrobicyclic pseudopeptide Ru(II) complex with appealing chemical and photophysical properties. Overall, our study demonstrates how subtle structural factors from a chiral effector in a reversible dynamic system rule the generation and selection of subsequent chiral elements with high fidelity and complete stereocontrol.
