         <title>Direct Epitaxial Growth of Polycrystalline MOF Membranes on Cu Foils for Uniform Li Deposition in Long&#8208;life Anode&#8208;free Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anode&#8208;free Li&#8208;metal battery (AFLMB) is being developed as the next generation of advanced energy storage devices. However, the low plating and stripping reversibility of Li on Cu foil prevents its widespread application. A promising avenue for further improvement is to enhance the lithophilicity of Cu foils and optimise their surfaces through a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) functional layer. However, excessive binder usage in the current approaches obscures the active plane of the MOF, severely limiting its performance. In response to this challenge, MOF polycrystalline membrane technology has been integrated into the field of AFLMB in this work. The dense and seamless HKUST&#8208;1 polycrystalline membrane was deposited on Cu foil (HKUST&#8208;1M@Cu) via an epitaxial growth strategy. In contrast to traditional MOF functional layers, this binder&#8208;free polycrystalline membrane fully exposes lithophilic sites, effectively reducing the nucleation overpotential and optimising the deposition quality of Li. Consequently, the Li plating layer becomes denser, eliminating the effects of dendrites. When coupled with LiFePO4 cathodes, the battery based on the HKUST&#8208;1 membrane exhibits excellent rate performance and cycling stability, achieving a high reversible capacity of approximately 160 mAh g&#8722;1 and maintaining a capacity retention of 80.9% after 1100 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Cocrystallization&#8208;Induced Red Ultralong Organic Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic cocrystals formed through multicomponent self&#8208;assembly have attracted significant interest owing to their clear structure and tunable optical properties. However, most cocrystal systems suffer from inefficient long&#8208;wavelength emission and low phosphorescence efficiency due to strong non&#8208;radiative processes governed by the energy gap law. Herein, an efficient long&#8208;lived red afterglow is achieved using a pyrene (Py) cocrystal system incorporating a second component (NPYC4) with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) properties. The cocrystal (NPYC4&#8208;Py) not only inherits the excellent luminescence of its monomeric counterparts, but also exhibits unique dual&#8208;mode characteristics, including persistent TADF and UOP emission with a high quantum yield of 58% and a lifetime of 362 ms. The precise cocrystal stacking distinctly reveals that intermolecular interactions lock the cocrystal formation and weaken the intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions between NPYC4 and Py, thereby stabilizing the excited triplet excitons. Furthermore, the favorable energy level of NPYC4 acts as a bridge, reducing the energy gap between the S1 and T1 states for Py, therefore activating its red phosphorescence from Py. This research provides direct insights into achieving efficient red UOP through co&#8208;crystallization.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Gene Expression System Using a Caging&#8208;Group&#8208;Free Photoactivatable Dye</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optical regulation of transcription using chemical compounds is an effective strategy to manipulate gene expression spatiotemporally. Conventional caging approaches with photoremovable protecting groups may require intense UV&#8208;light exposure and release potentially toxic byproducts. To address these problems, here we developed a light&#8208;mediated transcriptional regulation system by combining a caging&#8208;group&#8208;free photoactivatable dye PaX560 and a multidrug&#8208;binding transcriptional regulator QacR. The cationic dye generated from PaX560 through traceless photoconversion bound QacR and reduced its repressor function, resulting in transcriptional activation. Importantly, this system allowed transcriptional activation with a large dynamic range under mild visible light exposure and simultaneous detection of the state of the photoactivated effector. This module was integrated into the T7 RNA polymerase expression system to demonstrate light&#8208;activated transcription in vitro and in living cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Precisely Tuning Band Gaps of Hexabenzocoronene&#8208;Based MOFs Toward Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise adjusting the band gaps in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is crucial for improving their visible&#8208;light absorption capacity during photocatalysis, presenting both a formidable challenge and a charming opportunity. This present study employed a symmetry&#8208;reduction strategy to pre&#8208;design six novel 4&#8208;connected ligands with systematic substituents (&#8208;NO2, &#8208;H, &#8208;tBu, &#8208;OCH3, &#8208;OH and &#8208;NH2) and synthesized the corresponding pillared&#8208;layer Zr&#8208;MOFs (NKM&#8208;668) retaining the hexaphenylbenzene fragment. Subsequently, the NKM&#8208;668 MOFs were transformed into large&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated hexabenzocoronene&#8208;based MOFs (pNKM&#8208;668) via the Scholl reaction. These twelve MOFs exhibited broad and tunable band gaps over 1.41 eV (ranging from 3.25 eV to 1.84 eV), and the photocatalytic CO2 conversion rate raised by 33.2&#8208;fold. This study not only enriches the type of hexaphenylbenzene&#8208;based MOFs, but also paves the way for nanographene&#8208;containing MOFs in the further application of photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Band Engineering of Mn&#8208;P Alloy Enables HER&#8208;suppressed Aqueous Manganese Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous manganese ion batteries hold potential for stationary storage applications owing to their merits in cost, energy density, and environmental sustainability. However, the formidable challenge is the instability of metallic manganese (Mn) anodes in aqueous electrolytes due to severe hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which is more serious than the commonly studied Zn metal anodes. Moreover, the mechanism of HER side reactions has remained unclear. Herein, we design a series of Mn&#8208;P alloying anodes by precisely regulating their energy band structures to mitigate the HER issue. It is found that the serious HER primarily originates from the spontaneous Mn&#8208;H2O reaction driven by the excessively high HOMO energy level of Mn, rather than electrocatalytic water splitting. Owing to a reduced HOMO energy level and enhanced electron escape work function, the MnP anode achieves an evidently enhanced cycle durability (over 1000 hours at a high current density of 5 mA cm&#8208;2). The MnP||AgVO full cell with an N/P ratio of 4 exhibits better rate capability and extended cycle life (7000 cycles) with minimal capacity degradation than the cell using metallic Mn anode (less than 100 cycles). This study provides a practical approach for developing highly durable aqueous Mn ion batteries</dc:description>

         <title>A Fentanyl Hapten&#8208;Displaying Lipid Nanoparticle Vaccine that Non&#8208;Covalently Encapsulates a TLR7/8 Agonist and T&#8208;helper Epitope Induces Protective Anti&#8208;Fentanyl Immunity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Opioid use disorder &#8208; particularly involving fentanyl &#8208; has precipitated a public health crisis characterized by a significant increase in addiction and overdose&#8208;related deaths. Fentanyl&#8208;specific immunotherapy, which aims at inducing&#160;fentanyl&#8208;specific&#160;antibodies capable of binding fentanyl molecules in the bloodstream, preventing their entry in the central nervous system, is therefore gaining momentum.&#160;Conventional opioid designs&#160;rely on the covalent conjugation of fentanyl analogues to immunogenic carrier proteins that hold the inherent capacity of mounting immunodominant responses. Here, we present an alternative fentanyl vaccine design that utilizes a non&#8208;covalent assembly of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to deliver fentanyl haptens in conjunction with a CD4+&#160;T&#8208;helper peptide epitope and an imidazoquinoline TLR7/8 agonist. Our results demonstrate that a single intramuscular administration of the LNP&#8208;based nanovaccine elicits fentanyl&#8208;specific antibodies, significantly mitigating the effects of opioid overdose in preclinical mouse models. Furthermore, we analyzed the immunobiological behavior of the vaccine in vivo in mouse models, providing evidence that covalent attachment of a fentanyl hapten to a carrier proteins or peptide epitope is not necessary for inducing an effective immune response. However, co&#8208;delivery &#8208; specifically, the physical assembly of all immune cues into an LNP &#8208; remains essential for inducing hapten&#8208;specific immunity.</dc:description>

However, co-delivery - specifically, the physical assembly of all immune cues into an LNP - remains essential for inducing hapten-specific immunity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Standardized Parts for Activation of Small GTPase Signaling in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a plug and play approach for the direct control of small GTPase activation in living cells. This approach is applied to the temporal control of filopodia formation, membrane ruffling, cell retraction, and MAPK signaling.







Abstract
Small GTPases comprise a superfamily of over 167 proteins in the human genome and are critical regulators of a variety of pathways including cell migration and proliferation. Despite the importance of these proteins in cell signaling, a standardized approach for controlling small GTPase activation within living cells is lacking. Herein, we report a split&#8208;protein&#8208;based approach to directly activate small GTPase signaling in living cells. Importantly, our fragmentation site can be applied across the small GTPase superfamily. We highlight the utility of these standardized parts by demonstrating the ability to directly modulate the activity of four different small GTPases with user&#8208;defined inputs, providing the first plug and play system for direct activation of small GTPases in living cells.

         <title>Dichloromethane as C1 Synthon for the Photoredox Catalytic Cyclopropanation of Aromatic Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dichloromethane, an inexpensive C1 synthon, can be used with a nickel aminopyridine complex and iridium photocatalyst dual system to efficiently cyclopropanate aromatic olefins under mild conditions. This versatile methodology enables gram&#8208;scale synthesis of cyclopropanes. Mechanistic studies highlight the role of the reduced nickel complex, facilitating homolytic Csp3&#8722;Cl bond cleavage and chloromethyl radical formation, captured by olefins.







Abstract
Dichloromethane, as a readily available and inexpensive C1 synthon is proposed as a powerful building block for cyclopropanation of alkenes under mild conditions. Herein, we report a highly efficient and versatile dual photoredox system, involving a nickel aminopyridine coordination complex and a photocatalyst, for the cyclopropanation of aromatic olefins using dichloromethane, under visible&#8208;light irradiation. The cyclopropanation protocol has been successfully applied at gram scale. Mechanistic studies suggest a Ni(II) pyridyl radical complex as the key intermediate for the homolytic cleavage of the Csp3&#8722;Cl bond, generating a chloromethyl radical that is captured by the olefin coupling partner. Our findings also highlight the versatility of this methodology. By directing the radical/polar crossover process, we were able to selectively drive the reaction towards either the formation of cyclopropyl derivatives or the corresponding non&#8208;cyclic alkyl chloride products. The methodology also successfully apply to geminal dichloroalkanes, including the formation of spiro[2,2] compounds. Moreover, our methodology extends to the synthesis of deuterium&#8208;labelled cyclopropanes, demonstrating its utility in isotopic labelling and broadening its applicability in chemical synthesis and drug development.

         <title>Third Metal Ion Dictates the Catalytic Activity of the Two&#8208;Metal&#8208;Ion Pre&#8208;Ribosomal RNA&#8208;Processing Machinery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;atom simulations suggest that a transient K+ ion at the catalytic site promotes catalysis in RNase mitochondrial RNA processing complex by rigidifying the active site and promoting proton transfer from the water nucleophile to the scissile phosphate. Conversely, the third Mg2+ ion captured in the experimental structure hinders catalysis by blocking the proton transfer and preventing the approach of the K+ ion.







Abstract
Nucleic acid processing enzymes use a two&#8208;Mg2+&#8208;ion motif to promote the formation and cleavage of phosphodiester bonds. Yet, recent evidence demonstrates the presence of spatially conserved second&#8208;shell cations surrounding the catalytic architecture of proteinaceous and RNA&#8208;dependent enzymes. The RNase mitochondrial RNA processing (MRP) complex, which cleaves the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) precursor at the A3 cleavage site to yield mature 5&#8242;&#8208;end of 5.8S rRNA, hosts in the catalytic core one atypically&#8208;located Mg2+ ion, in addition to the ions forming the canonical catalytic motif. Here, we employ biased quantum classical molecular dynamics simulations of RNase MRP to discover that the third Mg2+ ion inhibits the catalytic process. Instead, its displacement in favour of a second&#8208;shell monovalent K+ ion propels phosphodiester bond cleavage by enabling the formation of a specific hydrogen bonding network that mediates the essential proton transfer step. This study points to a direct involvement of a transient K+ ion in the catalytic cleavage of the phosphodiester bond and implicates cation trafficking as a general mechanism in nucleic acid processing enzymes and ribozymes.

         <title>Coordination Environment and Distance Optimization of Dual Single Atoms on Fluorine&#8208;Doped Carbon Nanotubes for Chlorine Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A platinum dual single&#8208;atom catalyst (DSAC) dispersed on fluorine&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes was designed for an efficient and robust chlorine evolution reaction (CER) process. The prepared Pt DSAC exhibits excellent CER performance that outperforms that of the commercial dimensionally stable anode and Pt single&#8208;atom catalyst.







Abstract
The chlorine evolution reaction (CER) is a crucial anode reaction in the chlor&#8208;alkali industrial process. Precious metal&#8208;based dimensionally stable anodes (DSA) are commonly used as catalysts for CER but are constrained by their high cost and low selectivity. Herein, a Pt dual singe&#8208;atom catalyst (DSAC) dispersed on fluorine&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes (F&#8208;CNTs) is designed for an efficient and robust CER process. The prepared Pt DSAC demonstrates excellent CER activity with a low overpotential of 21&#8197;mV to achieve a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a remarkable mass activity of 3802.6&#8197;A&#8201;gpt&#8722;1 at an overpotential around 30&#8197;mV, outperforming those of commercial DSA and Pt single&#8208;atom catalyst. The excellent CER performance of Pt DSAC is attributed to the high atomic utilization and improved intrinsic activity. Notably, introducing fluorine atoms on CNTs increases the oxidation and chlorination resistance of Pt DSAC, and reduces the demetalization ratio of Pt atoms, resulting in excellent long&#8208;term CER stability. Theoretical calculations reveal that several Pt DSAC configurations with optimized first&#8208;shell ligands and interatomic distance display lower energy barriers for Cl intermediates generation and weaker ionic Pt&#8722;Cl bond interaction, which are favorable for the CER process.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Directed Synthesis of a Self&#8208;Organized Chloro&#8208;Bridged Cubic Pd(II) Cage Showing Selective Encapsulation of Phenols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stepwise formation of a metal&#8208;chloride neutral cage has been shown to involve the initial pre&#8208;organization of the Pd3 subunits of a Pd6&#8208;hexamer mediated by a directional oxamide linker to a tetrameric Pd12 assembly followed by its conversion into a Pd12&#8208;tetrahedron and finally to a chloro&#8208;bridged Pd24 cube upon ligand substitution. The Pd24&#8208;cube shows selective encapsulation of phenolic guest molecules.







Abstract
The synthesis and guest recognition properties of a neutral Pd24&#8208;cubic cage, [{Pd3(NiPr)3PO}8(&#956;2&#8208;Cl)24] 1 are reported. The formation of the cubical assembly takes place by an exclusive one&#8208;pot ligand&#8208;assisted pathway directed by an oximido linker. The initial coordination of the oximido ligand pre&#8208;organizes the [Pd3(NiPr)3PO]3+ polyhedral building units into a tetrameric intermediate, which then transforms into an oximido&#8208;tethered tetrahedral assembly and to the cubical cage 1 in the presence of chloride ions. In the absence of the directing oximido linker, no cage formation was observed, and the Pd6&#8208;precursor was found to undergo self&#8208;condensation, giving rise to a new pentameric polyhedral cluster, [Pd5{(NiPr)3PO}2(OAc)2(OH)2] 2. The central cavity of the cube has been probed for guest encapsulation studies, which shows a high binding with phenolic guest molecules with association constants of the order of 104&#8211;105&#8197;M&#8722;1. The favorable formation of host&#8211;guest complexes was attributed to the strong hydrogen bonding interactions between the host and guest functional groups.

&lt;p&gt;A stepwise formation of a metal-chloride neutral cage has been shown to involve the initial pre-organization of the Pd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; subunits of a Pd&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-hexamer mediated by a directional oxamide linker to a tetrameric Pd&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; assembly followed by its conversion into a Pd&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;-tetrahedron and finally to a chloro-bridged Pd&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt; cube upon ligand substitution. The Pd&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;-cube shows selective encapsulation of phenolic guest molecules.

         <title>Indazole to 2&#8208;Cyanoindole Scaffold Progression for Mycobacterial Lipoamide Dehydrogenase Inhibitors Achieves Extended Target Residence Time and Improved Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Cyanoindole Lpd inhibitors make critical contacts inside substrate lipoamide binding site to ensure induced fit tight binding and long residence time via Asn382 and Asn463. Asn463 is H&#8208;bonded with Tyr16 to maintain its favorable configuration. Mutations in any of these 3 residues lining the pocket result in inhibitor losing the induced fit interaction and long residence.







Abstract
Tuberculosis remains a leading cause of death from a single infection worldwide. Drug resistance to existing and even new antimycobacterials calls for research into novel targets and unexplored mechanisms of action. Recently we reported on the development of tight&#8208;binding inhibitors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) lipoamide dehydrogenase (Lpd), which selectively inhibit the bacterial but not the human enzyme based on a differential modality of inhibitor interaction with these targets. Here we report on the striking improvement in inhibitor residence time on the Mtb enzyme associated with scaffold progression from an indazole to 2&#8208;cyanoindole. Cryo&#8208;EM of Lpd with the bound 2&#8208;cyanoindole inhibitor 19 confirmed displacement of the buried water molecule deep in the binding channel with a cyano group. The ensuing hours&#8208;long improvement in on&#8208;target residence time is associated with enhanced antibacterial activity in axenic culture and in primary mouse macrophages. Resistance to 2&#8208;cyanoindole inhibitors involves mutations within the inhibitor binding site that have little effect on inhibitor affinity but change the modality of inhibitor&#8208;target interaction, resulting in fast dissociation from Lpd. These findings underscore that on&#8208;target residence time is a major determinant of antibacterial activity and in vivo efficacy.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Axial Self&#8208;Driven X&#8208;Ray Detection by a Two&#8208;Dimensional Biaxial Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Perovskite Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;axial self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection was achieved by using the multi&#8208;axial ferroelectric material BA2EA2Pb3I10 for the first time. It presents ultra&#8208;low detection limits along the c&#8208;axis and b&#8208;axis (19.4&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1 and 17.2&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, respectively) at zero bias, which was two orders of magnitude lower than commercial &#945;&#8208;Se.







Abstract
Metal halide perovskite ferroelectrics combining spontaneous polarization and excellent semiconducting properties is an ideal platform for enabling self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection. However, achievements to date have been only based on uniaxiality, which increases the complexity of device fabrication. Multi&#8208;axial ferroelectric materials have multiple equivalent polarization directions, making them potentially amenable to multi&#8208;axial self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection, but the report on these types of materials is still a huge blank. Herein, a high&#8208;quality (BA)2(EA)2Pb3I10 (1) biaxial ferroelectric single crystal was successfully grown, which exhibited significant spontaneous polarization along the c&#8208;axis and b&#8208;axis. Under X&#8208;ray irradiation, bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) was exhibited along both the c&#8208;axis and b&#8208;axis, with open circuit voltages (Voc) of 0.23&#8197;V and 0.22&#8197;V, respectively. Then, the BPVE revealed along the inversion of polarized direction with the polarized electric fields. Intriguingly, due to the BPVE of 1, 1 achieved multi&#8208;axial self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection for the first time (c&#8208;axis and b&#8208;axis) with relatively high sensitivities and ultralow detection limits (17.2&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1 and 19.4&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, respectively). This work provides a reference for the subsequent use of multi&#8208;axial ferroelectricity for multi&#8208;axial self&#8208;driven optoelectronic detection.

         <title>Facile Synthesis and Global Aromaticity of Aza&#8208;Superbenzene and Aza&#8208;Supernaphthalene at Different Oxidation States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetraazasuperbenzene (1) and a hexaazasupernaphthalene (2) were synthesized via a facile intermolecular Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation reaction. The neutral compounds show localized aromaticity and slow dynamics, but their charged dications, tetracations and hexacations show global aromaticity or anti&#8208;aromaticity with &#960; electrons mainly delocalized along the outmost skeletons.







Abstract
All&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or macrocycles usually display localized aromaticity. On the other hand, incorporation of quinoidal units into the skeleton could lead to effective electron delocalization and global (anti)aromaticity. In this work, fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocycle 1 and bismacrocycle 2 containing both para&#8208;quinodimethane and triphenylamine units are efficiently synthesized mainly through intermolecular Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation reaction. They can be considered as a tetraazasuperbenzene and a hexaazasupernaphthalene, respectively, due to their similar geometry and electronic structures to the benzene and naphthalene. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses reveal a largely planar geometry for both 1 and 2 and variable&#8208;temperature NMR measurements disclose slow dynamic processes owing to restricted ring flipping of the phenyl rings. 1 and 2 can be easily oxidized into higher&#8208;oxidation&#8208;state species. NMR and theoretical calculations indicate that 12+ and 14+ show global anti&#8208;aromaticity and aromaticity, respectively, with a dominant 32&#960; and 30&#960; conjugation pathway, while for the bismacrocycle 2, its dication 22+, tetracation 24+ and hexacation 26+ exhibit global aromaticity, antiaromaticity, and aromaticity with a 54&#960;, 52&#960; and 50&#960; conjugation pathway along the outermost backbone, respectively.

         <title>Regulating the Scaling Relations in Ammonia Synthesis through a Light&#8208;Driven Bendable Seesaw Effect on Tailored Iron Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stepped {110} surface of the prepared &#945;&#8208;Fe&#8208;110s exposes abundant C7 sites with moderate EN, achieving a delicate balance in scaling relations and thermal catalytic activity for ammonia synthesis. A novel light&#8208;induced &#8220;bendable seesaw effect&#8221; resulting from hot electron transfer between catalyst and adsorbates was discovered to regulate the scaling relations and further significantly enhances the catalytic activity.







Abstract
Advancing the energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8211;Bosch process faces significant challenges due to the intrinsic constraints of scaling relations in heterogeneous catalysis. Herein, we reported an approach of bending the &#8220;seesaw effect&#8221; to regulate the scaling relations over a tailored &#945;&#8208;Fe metallic material (&#945;&#8208;Fe&#8208;110s), realizing highly efficient light&#8208;driven thermal catalytic ammonia synthesis with a rate of 1260&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcatalyst&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 without additional heating. Specifically, the thermal catalytic activity of &#945;&#8208;Fe&#8208;110s was significantly enhanced by the novel stepped {110} surface, exhibiting a 3.8&#8208;fold increase compared to the commercial fused&#8208;iron catalyst with promoters at 350&#8201;&#176;C. The photo&#8208;induced hot electron transfer further accelerates the dinitrogen dissociation and hydrogenation simultaneously, effectively overcoming the limitation of scaling relation over identical sites. Consequently, the ammonia production rate of &#945;&#8208;Fe&#8208;110s was further enhanced by 30&#8197;times at the same temperature with irradiation. This work designs an efficient and sustainable system for ammonia synthesis and provides a novel approach for regulating the scaling relations in heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Ene&#8208;Reductase&#8208;Catalyzed Aromatization of Simple Cyclohexanones to Phenols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ene&#8208;reductase (TsER) system is reported that facilitates the direct aromatization of cyclohexanones to give substituted phenols. The process entails successive dehydrogenation of two saturated carbon&#8208;carbon bonds and leverages molecular oxygen from the air to drive the reaction cycle. This approach serves as a robust alternative to conventional synthetic methods.







Abstract
Direct aromatization of cyclohexanones to synthesize substituted phenols represents a significant challenge in modern synthetic chemistry. Herein, we describe a novel ene&#8208;reductase (TsER) catalytic system that converts substituted cyclohexanones into the corresponding phenols. This process involves the successive dehydrogenation of two saturated carbon&#8208;carbon bonds within the six&#8208;membered ring of cyclohexanones and utilizes molecular oxygen to drive the reaction cycle. It demonstrates a versatile and efficient approach for the synthesis of substituted phenols, providing a valuable complement to existing chemical methodologies.

         <title>Crosslink&#8208;Enhanced Emission&#8208;Dominated Design Strategy for Constructing Self&#8208;Protective Carbonized Polymer Dots With Near&#8208;Infrared Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>

         <dc:description>
A crosslink&#8208;enhanced emission (CEE)&#8208;dominated strategy was proposed, achieving desired Near&#8208;Infrared (NIR) room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) (710&#8197;nm) in self&#8208;protective carbonized polymer dots (CPDs). Combined with experiments and theoretical calculations, crosslinking, conjugation and steric hindrance factors were confirmed indispensable for triggering NIR RTP emission.







Abstract
Self&#8208;protective carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) with advantageous crosslinked nano&#8208;structures have attracted considerable attention in metal&#8208;free room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials, whereas their RTP emissions are still limited to short wavelength. Expanding their RTP emissions to Near&#8208;Infrared (NIR) range is attractive but suffers from the difficulties in constructing narrow energy levels and inhibiting intense non&#8208;radiative decay. Herein, a crosslink&#8208;enhanced emission (CEE)&#8208;dominated construction strategy was proposed, achieving desired NIR RTP (710&#8197;nm) in self&#8208;protective CPDs for the first time. Structural factors, i.e., crosslinking (covalent&#8208;bond CEE), conjugation (conjugated amine with bridging N&#8722;H and C=C group), and steric hindrance (confined&#8208;domain CEE), were confirmed indispensable for triggering NIR RTP emission in CPDs. Contrast experiments and theoretical calculations further revealed the rationality of the design strategy originating from CEE in terms of promoting the narrow energy level emission of triplet excitons and inhibiting the non&#8208;radiative quenching. This work not only firstly achieves NIR RTP in self&#8208;protective CPDs but also helps understand the origin of NIR RTP to further guide the synthesis of diverse CPDs with efficient long&#8208;wavelength RTP emission.

         <title>Pyrolytic Depolymerization of Polyolefins Catalysed by Zirconium&#8208;based UiO&#8208;66 Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defective UiO&#8208;66, a Zr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) catalyst, overcomes limitations in plastic waste depolymerization. During pyrolysis at 400&#8201;&#176;C, it promotes conversion of polyolefins to useful liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons, reducing solid wax formation. This approach also offers a distinct catalytic pathway compared to conventional zeolite catalysts.







Abstract
Polyolefins such as polyethylenes and polypropylenes are the most&#8208;produced plastic waste globally, yet are difficult to convert into useful products due to their unreactivity. Pyrolysis is a practical method for large&#8208;scale treatment of mixed, contaminated plastic, allowing for their conversion into industrially&#8208;relevant petrochemicals. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), despite their tremendous utility in heterogeneous catalysis, have been overlooked for polyolefin depolymerization due to their perceived thermal instabilities and inability of polyethylenes and polypropylenes to penetrate their pores. Herein, we demonstrate the viability of UiO&#8208;66 MOFs containing coordinatively&#8208;unsaturated zirconium nodes, as effective catalysts for pyrolysis that significantly enhances the yields of valuable liquid and gas hydrocarbons, whilst halving the amounts of residual solids produced. Reactions occur on the Lewis&#8208;acidic UiO&#8208;66 nodes, without the need for noble metals, and yield aliphatic product distributions distinctly different from the aromatic&#8208;rich hydrocarbons that can be obtained from zeolite catalysis. We also demonstrate the first unambiguous characterization of polyolefin penetration into UiO&#8208;66 pores at pyrolytic temperatures, allowing access to the abundant Zr&#8208;oxo nodes within the MOF interior for efficient C&#8722;C cleavage. Our work highlights the potential of MOFs as highly&#8208;designable heterogeneous catalysts for depolymerisation of plastics, which can complement conventional catalysts in reactivity.

By combining hydrogen&#8208;bonded bottlebrush block copolymers and electrostatic interaction induced polymer/inorganic eutectics, nanospheres and multi&#8208;stage morphology transformation from hexagonal platelets, needle&#8208;like, curved rod&#8208;like micelles, to end&#8208;to&#8208;end closed rings are obtained by solution and co&#8208;crystallization&#8208;assistant self&#8208;assembly, which not only endows unique nanostructure transition, also induce in&#8208;to&#8208;out reconfiguration of PS domain.







Abstract
Achieving structural reconfiguration of supramolecular bottlebrush block copolymers toward topological engineering is of particular interest but challenging. Here, we address the creation of supramolecular architectures to discover how assembled topology influences the structured aggregates, combining hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) bottlebrush block copolymers and electrostatic interaction induced polymer/inorganic eutectics. We first design H&#8208;bonding linear&#8208;brush block copolymer P(NBDAP&#8208;co&#8208;NBC)&#8208;b&#8208;P(NBPEO), bearing linear block P(NBDAP&#8208;co&#8208;NBC) (poly(norbornene&#8208;terminated diaminopyridine&#8208;co&#8208;norbornene&#8208;terminated hexane)) with pendant H&#8208;bonding DAP (diaminopyridine) motifs, and PEO (poly(ethylene oxide)) densely grafted P(NBPEO) brush block. Thanks to H&#8208;bonding association between DAP and thymine (Thy), incorporation of Thy&#8208;functionalized polystyrene (Thy&#8208;PS65) enables solution self&#8208;assembly and formation of H&#8208;bonded bottlebrush block copolymers, generating augmented nanospheres with increasing Thy&#8208;PS65 amount. Noteworthy that integration of inorganic cluster silicotungstic acid (STA) to P(NBC&#8208;co&#8208;NBDAP)&#8208;b&#8208;P(NBPEO), endows the formation of PEO/STA eutectic core. Therefore, co&#8208;crystallization&#8208;assistant self&#8208;assembly at the interfaces of polymeric, inorganic and supramolecular chemistry is realized, reflecting multi&#8208;stage morphology transformation from hexagonal platelets, needle&#8208;like, curved rod&#8208;like micelles, finally to end&#8208;to&#8208;end closed rings, by gradually increasing Thy&#8208;PS65 while fixing STA content. Interestingly, such solution self&#8208;assembly to co&#8208;crystallization&#8208;assistant self&#8208;assembly strategy not only endows unique nanostructure transition, also induce in&#8208;to&#8208;out reconfiguration of PS domains. These findings clearly provide unique methodology towards programmable fabrication of geometrical objects promising in smart materials.

         <title>Exocyclic and Linker Editing of Lys63&#8208;linked Ubiquitin Chains Modulators Specifically Inhibits Non&#8208;homologous End&#8208;joining Repair</title>

Strategic modifications to cyclic peptide CP2 followed by screening through in vitro cellular studies, yielding CP7, significantly enhance cell permeability and apoptosis&#8208;inducing activity. CP7 acts as a selective inhibitor of non&#8208;homologous end joining (NHEJ), increasing sensitivity to ionizing radiation, and suggesting a promising strategy for enhancing radiation therapy efficacy.







Abstract
Despite the great advances in discovering cyclic peptides against protein targets, their reduced aqueous solubility, cell permeability, and activity of the cyclic peptide restrict its utilization in advanced biological research and therapeutic applications. Here we report on a novel approach of structural alternation of the exocyclic and linker parts that led to a new derivative with significantly improved cell activity allowing us to dissect its mode of action in detail. We have identified an effective cyclic peptide (CP7) that induces approximately a 9&#8208;fold increase in DNA damage accumulation and a remarkable increase in apoptotic cancer cell death compared to the reported molecule. Notably, treating cells with CP7 leads to a dramatic decrease in the efficiency of non&#8208;homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair of DNA double&#8208;strand breaks (DSBs), which is accompanied by an increase in homologous recombination (HR) repair. Interestingly, treating BRCA1&#8208;deficient cells with CP7 restores HR integrity, which is accompanied by increased resistance to CP7. Additionally, CP7 treatment increases the sensitivity of cancer cells to ionizing radiation. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that CP7 is a selective inhibitor of NHEJ, offering a potential strategy to enhance the effectiveness of radiation therapy.

         <title>High&#8208;Energy Aqueous S&#8208;MnO2 Batteries with Redox Charge Carriers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Membrane&#8208;free aqueous S&#8208;MnO2 batteries were designed via matching Mn2+/MnO2 and S/Cu2S redox couplings, which exhibit high energy density and excellent cycling stability. These merits endow them with significant potential for large&#8208;scale energy storage.







Abstract
The energy densities of conventional aqueous batteries are often unsatisfactory due to the limited capacities of electrode materials. Therefore, the design of creative aqueous batteries has to be considered. Herein, aqueous S&#8208;MnO2 batteries are constructed by matching S/Cu2S redox couples and MnO2 deposition/dissolution. In such batteries, S/Cu2S redox couples undergo the solid&#8208;solid conversion reaction with four&#8208;electron transfer, ensuring a high specific capacity of 2220&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 in S anodes. Furthermore, the conversion reaction of S/Cu2S redox couples can take place stably in acidic electrolyte that is essential for the MnO2 deposition/dissolution. As a result, the S/Cu2S redox couples can match MnO2 deposition/dissolution well, which endow the batteries with a membrane&#8208;free configuration. As a proof of concept, Ah&#8208;level prismatic and single&#8208;flow batteries were assembled and could operate stably for over 1000&#8197;h, demonstrating their great potential for large&#8208;scale energy storage. This work broadens the horizons of aqueous batteries beyond metal&#8208;manganese chemistry.

         <title>A Bio&#8208;Inspired Multifunctional Hydrogel Network with Toughly Interfacial Chemistry for Dendrite&#8208;Free Flexible Zinc Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bio&#8208;inspired multifunctional hydrogel electrolyte network (polyacrylamide (PAM)/trehalose) with improved mechanical and adhesive properties was developed via a simple trehalose network&#8208;repairing strategy to stabilize the interfacial chemistry for dendrite&#8208;free and long&#8208;life flexible ZIBs. This work offers a great potential in flexible energy&#8208;related applications and beyond.







Abstract
Flexible and high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs), coupled with low cost and safe, are considered as one of the most promising energy storage candidates for wearable electronics. Hydrogel electrolytes present a compelling alternative to liquid electrolytes due to their remarkable flexibility and clear advantages in mitigating parasitic side reactions. However, hydrogel electrolytes suffer from poor mechanical properties and interfacial chemistry, which limits them to suppressed performance levels in flexible ZIBs, especially under harsh mechanical strains. Herein, a bio&#8208;inspired multifunctional hydrogel electrolyte network (polyacrylamide (PAM)/trehalose) with improved mechanical and adhesive properties was developed via a simple trehalose network&#8208;repairing strategy to stabilize the interfacial chemistry for dendrite&#8208;free and long&#8208;life flexible ZIBs. As a result, the trehalose&#8208;modified PAM hydrogel exhibits a superior strength and stretchability up to 100&#8197;kPa and 5338&#8201;%, respectively, as well as strong adhesive properties to various substrates. Also, the PAM/trehalose hydrogel electrolyte provides superior anti&#8208;corrosion capability for Zn anode and regulates Zn nucleation/growth, resulting in achieving a high Coulombic efficiency of 98.8&#8201;%, and long&#8208;term stability over 2400&#8197;h. Importantly, the flexible Zn//MnO2 pouch cell exhibits excellent cycling performance under different bending conditions, which offers a great potential in flexible energy&#8208;related applications and beyond.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Ligand Bonds Based Reprogrammable and Re&#8208;Processable Supramolecular Liquid Crystal Elastomer Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic crosslinked LCE network based on metal&#8208;ligand bonds can achieve orientation programming of liquid crystal mesogen via partial stress relaxation. This programmed LCE maintains stable actuation even at elevated temperatures due to the high strength of metal&#8208;ligand bonds comparable to traditional covalent bonds. The flexible and reversible nature of metal&#8208;ligand interactions also allows for the reprogramming of actuation behaviors and enables reprocessing and reshaping upon complete dissociation.

Dynamic covalent bonds endow liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) with network rearrangeability, facilitating the fixation of mesogen alignment induced by external forces and enabling reversible actuation. In comparison, the bond exchange of supramolecular interactions is typically too significant to stably maintain the programmed alignment, particularly under intensified external stimuli. Nevertheless, remaking and recycling of supramolecular interaction&#8208;based polymer networks are more accessible than those based on dynamic covalent bonds, as the latter are difficult to completely dissociate. Thus, preparing an LCE that possesses both supramolecular&#8208;like exchangeability and covalent bond&#8208;level stability remains a significant challenge. In this work, we addressed this issue by employing metal&#8208;ligand bonds as the crosslinking points of LCE networks. As such, mesogen alignment can be repeatedly encoded through metal&#8208;ligand bond exchange and stably maintained after programming, since the bond exchange rate is sufficiently slow when the programming and actuation temperatures are below the bond dissociation temperature. More importantly, the metal&#8208;ligand bonds can be completely dissociated at high temperatures, allowing the LCE network to be dissolved in a solvent and reshaped into desired geometries via solution casting. Building on these properties, our LCEs can be fabricated into versatile actuators, such as reversible folding origami, artificial muscles, and soft robotics.

&lt;p&gt;A dynamic crosslinked LCE network based on metal-ligand bonds can achieve orientation programming of liquid crystal mesogen via partial stress relaxation. This programmed LCE maintains stable actuation even at elevated temperatures due to the high strength of metal-ligand bonds comparable to traditional covalent bonds. The flexible and reversible nature of metal-ligand interactions also allows for the reprogramming of actuation behaviors and enables reprocessing and reshaping upon complete dissociation.

         <title>MOFite: A High&#8208;Density Lithiophilic and Scalable Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Anode for Rechargeable Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>

A salicylaldehydate&#8208;linked iron&#8208;based MOF (Fe&#8722;Tp) was demonstrated as a scalable and high&#8208;performance pristine anode material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIB). Furthermore, Fe&#8722;Tp has been explored as a performance enhancer for commercial graphite anodes in LIBs, highlighting its potential practical utility.







Abstract
Developing an anode material that has better performance efficiency than commercial graphite while keeping the features of economic scalability and environmental safety is highly desirable yet challenging. MOFs are a promising addition to the ongoing efforts, however, the relatively poor performance, chemical instability, and large&#8208;scale economic production of efficiency&#8208;proven pristine MOFs restrict their utility in real&#8208;life energy storage applications. Furthermore, hierarchical porosity for lucid mass diffusion, high&#8208;density lithiophilic sites are some of the structural parameters for improving the electrode performance. Herein, we have demonstrated the potential of economically scalable salicylaldehydate 3D&#8208;conjugated&#8208;MOF (Fe&#8722;Tp) as a high&#8208;performance anode in Li&#8208;ion batteries: the anode&#8208;specific capacity achieved up to 1447&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 89&#8201;% of cyclic stability after 500&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 for pristine MOF. More importantly, incorporating 10&#8201;% Fe&#8722;Tp doping in commercial graphite (MOFite) significantly enhanced lithium storage, doubling capacity after 400&#8197;cycles. It signifies the potential practical utility of Fe&#8722;Tp as a performance booster for commercial anode material.

         <title>Reductive Elimination From Tetra&#8208;Alkyl Cuprates [MenCu(CF3)4&#8722;n]&#8722; (n=0&#8211;4): Beyond Simple Oxidation States</title>

The full series of high&#8208;valent cuprates [MenCu(CF3)4&#8722;n]&#8722;, 0&#8804;n&#8804;4, has been studied by a combination of gas&#8208;phase fragmentation experiments and quantum chemical calculations. The distinct reactivities observed can be attributed to subtle differences in the electronic structures of the complexes.







Abstract
In recent years, the electronic structures of organocuprates in general and the complex [Cu(CF3)4]&#8722; in particular have attracted significant interest. A possible key indicator in this context is the reactivity of these species. Nonetheless, this aspect has received only limited attention. Here, we systematically study the series of tetra&#8208;alkyl cuprates [MenCu(CF3)4&#8722;n]&#8722; and their unimolecular reactivity in the gas phase, which includes concerted formal reductive eliminations as well as radical losses. Through computational studies, we characterize the electronic structures of the complexes and show how these are connected to their reactivity. We find that all [MenCu(CF3)4&#8722;n]&#8722; ions feature inverted ligand fields and that the distinct reactivity patterns of the individual complexes arise from the interplay of different effects.

         <title>Nonplanar Nanographene: A Hydrocarbon Hole&#8208;Transporting Material That Competes with Triarylamines</title>

         <dc:description>
Hexabenzo[a,c,fg,j,l,op]tetracene (HBT), a small nonplanar nanographene, functions as a hydrocarbon HTM with hole transport properties that match those of triarylamine&#8208;based HTMs. A HBT&#8208;based OLED exhibited excellent performance, featuring superior curves for current density&#8211;voltage, external quantum efficiency&#8211;luminance, and lifetime as compared to those of representative triarylamine&#8208;based OLEDs.







Abstract
Hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) are essential for optoelectronic devices, such as organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells, and perovskite solar cells. Triarylamines have been employed as HTMs since they were introduced in 1987. However, heteroatoms or side chains embedded in the core skeleton of triarylamines can cause thermal and chemical stability problems. Herein, we report that hexabenzo[a,c,fg,j,l,op]tetracene (HBT), a small nonplanar nanographene, functions as a hydrocarbon HTM with hole transport properties that match those of triarylamine&#8208;based HTMs. X&#8208;ray structural analysis and theoretical calculations revealed effective multidirectional orbital interactions and transfer integrals for HBT. In&#8208;depth experimental and theoretical analyses revealed that the nonplanarity&#8208;inducing annulative &#960;&#8208;extension can achieve not only a stable amorphous state in bulk films, but also a higher increase in the highest occupied molecular orbital level than conventional linear or cyclic &#960;&#8208;extension. Furthermore, an in&#8208;house manufactured HBT&#8208;based OLED exhibited excellent performance, featuring superior curves for current density&#8211;voltage, external quantum efficiency&#8211;luminance, and lifetime compared to those of representative triarylamine&#8208;based OLEDs. A notable improvement in device lifetime was observed for the HBT&#8208;based OLED, highlighting the advantages of the hydrocarbon HTM. This study demonstrates the immense potential of small nonplanar nanographenes for optoelectronic device applications.

         <title>Efficient Self&#8208;Sorting Behaviours of Metallacages with Subtle Structural Differences</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we elucidated the unusual and efficient self&#8208;sorting behaviour of metallacages with subtle structural differences in batch reactors and microdroplets. The volume confinement and efficient mixing effects within microdroplets accelerate the self&#8208;sorting of metallacages in microdroplets compared to the same self&#8208;sorting in batch reactors.







Abstract
Investigating the self&#8208;sorting behaviour of assemblies with subtle structural differences is a captivating yet challenging endeavour. Herein, we elucidate the unusual self&#8208;sorting behaviour of metallacages with subtle structural differences in batch reactors and microdroplets.

&lt;p&gt;Herein, we elucidated the unusual and efficient self-sorting behaviour of metallacages with subtle structural differences in batch reactors and microdroplets. The volume confinement and efficient mixing effects within microdroplets accelerate the self-sorting of metallacages in microdroplets compared to the same self-sorting in batch reactors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigating the self-sorting behaviour of assemblies with subtle structural differences is a captivating yet challenging endeavour. Herein, we elucidate the unusual self-sorting behaviour of metallacages with subtle structural differences in batch reactors and microdroplets.

         <title>Heteroatoms&#8208;Stabilized Single Palladium Atoms on Amorphous Zeolites: Breaking the Tradeoff between Catalytic Activity and Selectivity for Alkyne Semihydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient catalytic system based on single&#8208;atom Pd catalysts supported on heteroatom (B, Al, or Ga)&#8208;containing amorphous zeolite, achieves the tradeoff breaking between the activity and selectivity for the semihydrogenation of alkynes, demonstrating a recorded turnover frequency value of 24198&#8197;h&#8722;1 and high styrene selectivity (95&#8201;%).







Abstract
As a fundamental industrial catalytic process, the semihydrogenation of alkynes presents a challenge in striking a balance between activity and selectivity due to the issue of over&#8208;hydrogenation. Herein, we develop an efficient catalytic system based on single&#8208;atom Pd catalysts supported on boron&#8208;containing amorphous zeolites (Pd/AZ&#8722;B), achieving the tradeoff breaking between the activity and selectivity for the selective hydrogenation of alkynes. Advanced characterizations and theoretical density functional theory calculations confirm that the incorporated B atoms in the Pd/AZ&#8722;B can not only alter the geometric and electronic properties of Pd atoms by controlling the electron migration from Pd but also mitigate the interaction between alkene and the catalyst supports. This boosts the exceptional catalytic efficacy in the semihydrogenation of phenylacetylene to styrene under mild conditions (298&#8197;K, 2&#8197;bar H2), achieving a recorded turnover frequency (TOF) value of 24198&#8197;h&#8722;1 and demonstrating 95&#8201;% selectivity to styrene at full conversion of phenylacetylene. By comparison, the heteroatom&#8208;free amorphous zeolite&#8208;anchored Pd nanoparticles and the commercial Lindlar catalyst have styrene selectivities of 73&#8201;% and 15&#8201;%, respectively, under identical reaction conditions. This work establishes a solid foundation for developing highly active and selective hydrogenation catalysts by controllably optimizing their electronic and steric properties.

         <title>SnF2&#8208;Catalyzed Lithiophilic&#8211;Lithiophobic Gradient Interface for High&#8208;Rate PEO&#8208;Based All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
SnF2&#8208;catalyzed lithiophilic&#8211;lithiophobic gradient SEI layer (SCG&#8208;SEI) exhibits a low nucleation overpotential along with strong mechanical strength, enabling rapid Li+ diffusion and electron conduction. This synergistic effect facilitates the dendrite&#8208;free deposition of PEO&#8208;based solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries, thus ensuring excellent cells performance even under ultra&#8208;high temperature (100&#8201;&#176;C) and high current density (5&#8197;C).







Abstract
Polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs) are strongly hindered by the fast dendrite growth at the Li metal/electrolyte interface, especially under large rates. The above issue stems from the suboptimal interfacial chemistry and poor Li+ transport kinetics during cycling. Herein, a SnF2&#8208;catalyzed lithiophilic&#8208;lithiophobic gradient solid electrolyte interphase (SCG&#8208;SEI) of LixSny/LiF&#8208;Li2O is in situ formed. The superior ionic LiF&#8208;Li2O rich upper layer (17.1&#8197;nm) possesses high interfacial energy and fast Li+ diffusion channels, wherein lithiophilic LixSny alloy layer (8.4&#8197;nm) could highly reduce the nucleation overpotential with lower diffusion barrier and promote rapid electron transportation for reversible Li+ plating/stripping. Simultaneously, the insoluble SnF2&#8208;coordinated PEO promotes the rapid Li+ ion transport in the bulk phase. As a result, an over 46.7 and 3.5&#8197;times improvements for lifespan and critical current density of symmetrical cells are achieved, respectively. Furthermore, LiFePO4&#8208;based ASSLMBs deliver a recorded cycling performance at 5&#8197;C (over 1000 cycles with a capacity retention of 80.0&#8201;%). More importantly, impressive electrochemical performances and safety tests with LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 and pouch cell with LiFePO4, even under extreme conditions (i.e., 100&#8201;&#176;C), are also demonstrated, reconfirmed the importance of lithiophilic&#8208;lithiophobic gradient interfacial chemistry in the design of high&#8208;rate ASSLMBs for safety applications.

         <title>Interfacial Electronic Interactions Promoted Activation for Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia over Ag&#8208;Modified Co3O4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The IEIs between Ag and Co3O4 significantly strengthen NO3&#8722; adsorption and stabilize CoO6 octahedrons within Co3O4, while suppressing H2 production. The synergistic effect of multiple active sites realizes tandem catalysis: NO3&#8722; reduction to NO2&#8722; predominantly occurs at Ag sites whereas NO2&#8722; tends to hydrogenate to NH3 at Co sites.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction to ammonia (NRA) offers a promising pathway for ammonia synthesis. The interfacial electronic interactions (IEIs) can regulate the physicochemical capabilities of catalysts in electrochemical applications, while the impact of IEIs on electrocatalytic NRA remains largely unexplored in current literature. In this study, the high&#8208;efficiency electrode Ag&#8208;modified Co3O4 (Ag1.5Co/CC) is prepared for NRA in neutral media, exhibiting an impressive nitrate conversion rate of 96.86&#8201;%, ammonia Faradaic efficiency of 96.11&#8201;%, and ammonia selectivity of ~100&#8201;%. Notably, the intrinsic activity of Ag1.5Co/CC is ~81&#8197;times that of Ag nanoparticles (Ag/CC). Multiple characterizations and theoretical computations confirm the presence of IEIs between Ag and Co3O4, which stabilize the CoO6 octahedrons within Co3O4 and significantly promote the adsorption of reactants (NO3&#8722;) as well as intermediates (NO2&#8722; and NO), while suppressing the Heyrovsky step, thereby improving nitrate electroreduction efficiency. Furthermore, our findings reveal a synergistic effect between different active sites that enables tandem catalysis for NRA: NO3&#8722; reduction to NO2&#8722; predominantly occurs at Ag sites while NO2&#8722; tends to hydrogenate to ammonia at Co sites. This study offers valuable insights for the development of high&#8208;performance NRA electrocatalysts.

         <title>The Formation Mechanism of Carbonized Polymer Dots: Crosslinking&#8208;Induced Nucleation and Carbonization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crosslinking&#8208;induced nucleation and carbonization (CINC) is proposed as the formation mechanism of carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) by exploring the effect of crosslinking on the formation of CPDs. Based on the principle of CINC, the influence factors of size are revealed, and the higher crosslinking degree can also bring a higher carbonization degree to realize the regulation of photoluminescence.







Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs), as a kind of zero&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials, have been widely synthesized by bottom&#8208;up methods from various precursors. However, the formation mechanism is still unclear and controversial, which also brings difficulty to the regulation of structures and properties. Only some tentative formation processes were postulated by analyzing the products obtained at different reaction times and temperatures. Here, the effect of crosslinking on the formation of carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) is explored. Crosslinking&#8208;induced nucleation and carbonization (CINC) is proposed as the driving force for the formation of CPDs. Under hydrothermal synthesis, the precursors are initiated to polymerize and crosslink. The crosslinking brings higher hydrophobicity to generate the hydrophilic/hydrophobic microphase separation, which promotes dehydration and carbonization resulting in the formation of CPDs. Based on the principle of CINC, the influence factors of size are also revealed. Moreover, the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulation is employed to support this formation mechanism. This concept of CINC will bring light to the formation process of CPDs, as well as facilitate the regulation of CPDs&#8217; size and photoluminescence.

         <title>Cell Surface Engineering by Phase&#8208;Separated Coacervates for Antibody Display and Targeted Cancer Cell Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tripeptide forms phase&#8208;separated coacervates, which functionalize the surface of NK cells, display an anti&#8208;HER2 mAb within the coacervate layer on the cell surface, and guide the NK cells to recognize and kill HER2+ cancer cells.







Abstract
Cell therapies such as CAR&#8722;T have demonstrated significant clinical successes, driving the investigation of immune cell surface engineering using natural and synthetic materials to enhance their therapeutic performance. However, many of these materials do not fully replicate the dynamic nature of the extracellular matrix (ECM). This study presents a cell surface engineering strategy that utilizes phase&#8208;separated peptide coacervates to decorate the surface of immune cells. We meticulously designed a tripeptide, Fmoc&#8722;Lys&#8722;Gly&#8722;Dopa&#8722;OH (KGdelta; Fmoc=fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl; delta=Dopa, dihydroxyphenylalanine), that forms coacervates in aqueous solution via phase separation. These coacervates, mirroring the phase separation properties of ECM proteins, coat the natural killer (NK) cell surface with the assistance of Fe3+ ions and create an outer layer capable of encapsulating monoclonal antibodies (mAb), such as Trastuzumab. The antibody&#8208;embedded coacervate layer equips the NK cells with the ability to recognize cancer cells and eliminate them through enhanced antibody&#8208;dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). This work thus presents a unique strategy of cell surface functionalization and demonstrates its use in displaying cancer&#8208;targeting mAb for cancer therapies, highlighting its potential application in the field of cancer therapy.

Benefitting from the extended &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization within the highly aromatic ladder&#8208;type polymeric backbone, the as&#8208;prepared polymer exhibits fast intra&#8208;chain charge transport along the polymeric chain, realizing its extraordinary proton&#8208;storage capability in aqueous proton batteries.







Abstract
A ladder&#8208;type rigid&#8208;coplanar polymer with highly ordered molecular arrangement has been designed via a covalent cycloconjugation conformational strategy. Benefitting from the extended &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization in the highly aromatic ladder&#8208;type polymeric backbone, the prepared polymer exhibits fast intra&#8208;chain charge transport along the polymeric chain, realizing extraordinary proton&#8208;storage capability in aqueous proton batteries.Affordable and safe aqueous proton batteries (APBs) with unique &#8220;Grotthuss mechanism,&#8221; are very significant for advancing carbon neutrality initiatives. While organic polymers offer a robust and adaptable framework that is well&#8208;suited for APB electrodes, the limited proton&#8208;storage redox capacity has constrained their broader application. Herein, a ladder&#8208;type polymer (PNMZ) has been designed via a covalent cycloconjugation conformational strategy that exhibits optimized electronic structure and fast intra&#8208;chain charge transport within the high&#8208;aromaticity polymeric skeleton. As a result, the polymer exhibits exceptional proton&#8208;storage redox kinetics, which are evidenced by in&#8208;operando monitoring techniques and theoretical calculations. It achieves a remarkable proton&#8208;storage capacity of 189&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability, with approximately 97.8&#8201;% capacity retention over 10,000&#8197;cycles. Finally, a high&#8208;performance all&#8208;polymer APB device has been successfully constructed with a desirable capacity retention of 99.7&#8201;% after 6,000&#8197;cycles and high energy density of 56.3&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1.

&#946;&#8208;(1,3&#8208;dioxane)ester was designed and used to prepare high&#8208;performance poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) via a straightforward modification with &#946;&#8208;ketoesters, followed by the cross&#8208;linking reaction with 1,3&#8208;diol groups. Treatment with HCl solution and heat allows the deconstruction of the cross&#8208;linked PVA, ensuring the selective and quantitative recovery of the initial materials.







Abstract
The development of mechanically robust, chemically stable, and yet recyclable polymers represents an essential undertaking in the context of advancing a circular economy for plastics. Here, we introduce a novel cleavable &#946;&#8208;(1,3&#8208;dioxane)ester (DXE) linkage, synthesized through the catalyst&#8208;free reaction of &#946;&#8208;ketoester and 1,3&#8208;diol, to cross&#8208;link poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) for the formation of high&#8208;performance thermosets with inherent chemical recyclability. PVA, modified with &#946;&#8208;ketoester groups through the transesterification reaction with excess tert&#8208;butyl acetoacetate, undergoes cross&#8208;linking reactions with the unmodified 1,3&#8208;diols within PVA itself upon thermal treatment. The cross&#8208;linking architecture improves PVA&#8217;s mechanical properties, with Young's modulus and toughness that can reach up to 656&#8197;MPa and 84&#8197;MJ&#8201;cm&#8722;3, i.e. approximately 3&#8208; and 12&#8208;fold those of linear PVA, respectively. Thermal treatment of the cross&#8208;linked PVA polymers under acid conditions leads to deconstruction of the networks, enabling the excellent recovery (&gt;90&#8201;%) of PVA. In the absence of either thermal or acidic treatment, the cross&#8208;linked PVA maintains its dimensional stability. We show that the recovery of PVA is also possible when the treatment is performed in the presence of other plastics commonly found in recycling mixtures. Furthermore, PVA&#8208;based composites comprising carbon fibers and activated charcoal cross&#8208;linked by the DXE linkages are also shown to be recyclable with recovery of the PVA and the fillers.

         <title>Highly Efficient Low&#8208;loaded PdOx/AlSiOx Catalyst for Ethylene Dimerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isolated Pd(II) sites anchored by vicinal hydroxyls of Al2O3&#8722;SiO2 support possess unexpectedly high activity for ethylene dimerization. The fundamentals of catalyst performance were elucidated by combining catalytic experiments, in situ catalyst characterization, and DFT calculations. The developed catalyst was successfully applied for direct synthesis of propylene from ethylene by rational integration of dimerization and metathesis reactions.







Abstract
Ethylene dimerization is an industrial process that is currently carried out using homogeneous catalysts. Here we present a highly active heterogeneous catalyst containing minute amounts of atomically dispersed Pd. It requires no co&#8208;catalyst(s) or activator(s) and significantly outperforms previously reported catalysts tested under similar reaction conditions. The selectivity to C4&#8208; and C6&#8208;hydrocarbons was about 80&#8201;% and 10&#8201;% at 42&#8201;% ethylene conversion at 200&#8201;&#176;C using an industrially relevant feed containing 50&#8197;vol&#8201;% ethylene, respectively. Our kinetic and catalyst characterization experiments complemented by density functional theory calculations provide molecular insights into the local environment of isolated Pd(II)Ox species and their role in achieving high activity in the target reaction. When the developed catalyst was rationally integrated with a Mo&#8208;containing olefin metathesis catalyst in the same reactor, the formed butenes reacted with ethylene to propylene with a selectivity of 98&#8201;% at about 24&#8201;% ethylene conversion.

         <title>Water&#8208;Involved Carbon&#8208;Nitrogen Triple&#8208;Bond Monomer Based Polymerization toward Processable Functional Polyamides under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A powerful polymerization of water, isocyanide, and chlorooxime was established toward polyamide with a novel modifiable architecture. Through hydroxyl&#8208;yne click reaction, emissive units were introduced to the polyamide, which emission colors could range from blue to red. The refractive index (n) of polyamides was also significantly improved and the &#916;n could be unprecedentedly as high as 0.1054 for non&#8208;heavy atom&#8208;containing polymers.







Abstract
Polyamide plays a pivotal role in engineering thermoplastics. Constrained by the harsh conditions and arduous procedures for its industrial synthesis, developing facile synthesis of polyamides is still challengeable and holds profound significance. Herein, we successfully utilized water as one of the monomers to synthesize functional polyamides under ambient conditions. A powerful multicomponent polymerization of water, isocyanides, and chlorooximes was established in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline. Soluble and thermally stable polyamides with high weight&#8208;average molecular weights (up to 53 900) were obtained in excellent yields (up to 95&#8201;%). The polymerization exhibits unique polymerization&#8208;induced emission characteristics, successfully converting non&#8208;emissive monomers into unconventional emissive polymers. Notably, the resultant polyamides could undergo effective post&#8208;modification via the hydroxyl&#8208;yne click reaction. By incorporating various functional groups into the polyamide, its emission color could be fine&#8208;tuned from blue to green and to red. Remarkably, the refractive index (n) of the polyamide at 589&#8197;nm could be increased from 1.6173 to 1.7227 and the &#916;n could be unprecedentedly as high as 0.1054 for non&#8208;heavy atom&#8208;containing polymers after post&#8208;modification, and its micron&#8208;thick films exhibited excellent transparency in the visible region. Thus, this work not only establishes a powerful polymerization toward novel polyamides but also opens up an avenue for their versatile functionalization.

         <title>Tailoring the Electrode&#8208;Electrolyte Interface for Reliable Operation of All&#8208;Climate 4.8&#8197;V Li||NCM811 Batteries</title>

A superior oxidation&#8208;resistant electrolyte is designed to conquer the high&#8208;voltage nickel&#8208;rich lithium metal batteries. Our electrolyte demonstrates superb compatibility with both lithium metal anode and NCM811 cathode at even 4.8&#8197;V. We validate a 4.8&#8197;V&#8208;class Li||NCM811 pouch cell with energy density of 462.2&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 pioneeringly, highlighting the practical potential of our electrolyte.







Abstract
Combining high&#8208;voltage nickel&#8208;rich cathodes with lithium metal anodes is among the most promising approaches for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium batteries. However, most current electrolytes fail to simultaneously satisfy the compatibility requirements for the lithium metal anode and the tolerance for the ultra&#8208;high voltage NCM811 cathode. Here, we have designed an ultra&#8208;oxidation&#8208;resistant electrolyte by meticulously adjusting the composition of fluorinated carbonates. Our study reveals that a solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) rich in LiF and Li2O is constructed on the lithium anode through the synergistic decomposition of the fluorinated solvents and PF6&#8722; anion, facilitating smooth lithium metal deposition. The superior oxidation resistance of our electrolyte enables the Li||NCM811&#8197;cell to deliver a capacity retention of 80&#8201;% after 300&#8197;cycles at an ultrahigh cut&#8211;off voltage of 4.8&#8197;V. Additionally, a pioneering 4.8&#8197;V&#8208;class lithium metal pouch cell with an energy density of 462.2&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 stably cycles for 110&#8197;cycles under harsh conditions of high cathode loading (30&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2), low N/P ratio (1.18), and lean electrolytes (2.3&#8197;g&#8201;Ah&#8722;1).

         <title>Improved Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electrocatalysis through Hydrogen Poisoning Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen poisoning effects over NiCoP@CC occurring at low overpotentials can leave behind catalytically inert poisoned HI* at Co&#8208;hollow sites and thereby create ideally reactive HII*. The dimerization between HI* and HII* for HER was suppressed due to catalytic inertia of HI* and thereby NITRR was timely initiated through HII* owing to ideal hydrogenation reactivity of HII*. As a result, a record high NH3 production rate and Faraday efficiency were achieved at low energy consumption.







Abstract
Electrochemical conversion from nitrate to ammonia is a key step in sustainable ammonia production. However, it suffers from low productive efficiency or high energy consumption due to a lack of desired electrocatalysts. Here we report nickel cobalt phosphide (NiCoP) catalysts for nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia electrocatalysis that display a record&#8208;high catalytic current density of &#8722;702&#177;7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, ammonia production rate of 5415&#177;26&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and Faraday efficiency of 99.7&#177;0.2&#8201;% at &#8722;0.3&#8197;V vs. RHE, affording the estimated energy consumption as low as 22.7&#8197;kWh&#8201;kgammonia&#8722;1. Theoretical and experimental results reveal that these catalysts benefit from hydrogen poisoning effects, which leave behind catalytically inert adsorbed hydrogen species (HI*) at Co&#8208;hollow sites and thereupon enable ideally reactive HII* at secondary Co&#8722;P sites. The dimerization between HI* and HII* for H2 evolution is blocked due to the catalytic inertia of HI* thereby the HII* drives nitrate hydrogenation timely. With these catalysts, the continuous ammonia production is further shown in an electrolyser with a real energy consumption of 18.9&#8197;kWh&#8201;kgammonia&#8722;1.

         <title>Stable Meisenheimer Complexes as Powerful Photoreductants Readily Obtained from Aza&#8208;Hetero Aromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong reducing systems (&#8804;3.0&#8197;V vs SCE) can be obtained simply and practically by adding nBuLi to available heterocyclic compounds (pyridine, isoquinoline, etc) and using them under irradiation at 456&#8197;nm. Strong photoreductans obtained are capable of reducing electron&#8208;rich arylchlorides.







Abstract
Excited states of radical anions derived from the photoreduction of stable organic molecules are suggested to serve as potent reductants. However, excited states of these species are too short&#8208;lived to allow bimolecular quenching processes. Recently, the singlet excited state of Meisenheimer complexes, which possess a long&#8208;lived excited state, was identified as the competent species for the reduction of challenging organic substrates (&#8722;2.63&#8197;V vs. SCE, saturated calomel electrode). To produce reasonably stable and simply accessible different Meisenheimer complexes, the addition of nBuLi to readily available aromatic heterocycles was investigated, and the photoreactivity of the generated species was studied. In this paper, we present the straightforward preparation of a family of powerful photoreductants (*Eox&lt;&#8722;3&#8197;V vs. SCE in their excited states, determined by DFT and time&#8208;dependent TD&#8208;DFT calculations; DFT, density functional theory) that can induce dehalogenation of electron&#8208;rich aryl chlorides and to form C&#8722;C bond through radical cyclization. Photophysical analyses and computational studies in combination with experimental mechanistic investigations demonstrate the ability of the adduct to act as a strong electron donor under visible light irradiation.

         <title>Toggling the Oxygen Affinity between Anthracenes and Naphthalenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Singlet oxygen reacts selectively with pyridylanthracenes or naphthalenes, allowing switching between both units in a dyad. Four different stages can be addressed by a combination of protonation, oxidation, and thermolysis. Furthermore, optical spectroscopy offers a simple read&#8208;out method.







Abstract
We present the design of an anthracenyl&#8211;naphthyl (ANT&#8208;NAPH) dyad and its application as a luminescent 4&#8208;stage photo switch. Both segments can individually react with singlet oxygen to switch off an optical response. In their initial form the larger ANT component reacts significantly faster and thus an ANTO2&#8208;NAPH stage is turned on, observed by optical response of the remaining NAPH. To reduce its reactivity, ANT is substituted with two pyridine rings. This concept is first investigated and quantified on ANT and NAPH as separated molecules. Upon protonation the reaction of ANT becomes significantly slower. For the three possible pyridyl isomers this effect increases along the order meta&lt;para&lt;ortho. With the pyridyl nitrogen in ortho position the reaction completely toggles from ANT to NAPH. Application of this concept on the dyad allows to turn on the ANT&#8208;NAPHO2 stage with optical response of the remaining ANT. The sequence of protonation&#8208;oxygenation&#8208;neutralization is thereby the only possible way to isolate the unfavored form ANT&#8208;NAPHO2. In the dyad ANT and NAPH are directly attached and their coupling constitutes a non&#8208;oxygenated third stage, where the NAPH luminescence is quenched and ANT luminescence is enhanced. Reaction of both NAPH and ANT to ANTO2&#8208;NAPHO2 constitutes the fourth dark stage.

         <title>Stereodivergency in Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Borylative Difunctionalizations: The Impact of Boron Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed stereodivergent borylative difunctionalization strategy is reported. The key component in obtaining stereodivergence lies in the Lewis acidity of the introduced boron group. The more Lewis acidic Bpin group enables chelation control affording an all cis diastereomer. Conversely, the less acidic Bdan group overrides this preference by disfavouring adduct formation, leading to a bifurcation in the stereochemical outcome.







Abstract
A reagent&#8208;controlled diastereodivergent copper&#8208;catalyzed borylative difunctionalization is reported. The formation of Lewis adducts that guide selectivity is commonly invoked in organic reaction mechanisms. Using density functional theory calculations, we identified BpinBdan as a sterically similar and less Lewis acidic alternative to B2pin2. Using a newly developed borylative aldol domino reaction as the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we demonstrate a change in stereochemical outcome by a simple change of borylating reagent&#8212;B2pin2 affords the diastereomer associated with coordination control while BpinBdan overturns this mode of binding. We show that this strategy can be generalized to other scaffolds and, more importantly, that BpinBdan does not alter the diastereomeric outcome of the reaction when coordination is not involved. BpinBdan can be viewed as a mechanistic probe for coordination in future copper&#8208;catalyzed borylation reactions.

         <title>Porous Organic Cage as an Efficient Platform for Industrial Radioactive Iodine Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous organic cage (POC) was firstly developed as an efficient platform for industrial radioactive iodine capture, which provides a new insight for sufficiently utilizing binding sites. The constructed NKPOC&#8208;DT&#8208;(I&#8722;)Me (NKPOC=Nankai porous organic cage) demonstrates a record&#8208;high I2 uptake of 48.35&#8197;wt&#8201;%, extraordinary adsorption capacity of unitionic sites (1.62 I2/ionic sites), and remarkable kinetics (k1=0.013&#8197;min&#8722;1).







Abstract
Herein, we firstly develop porous organic cage (POC) as an efficient platform for highly effective radioactive iodine capture under industrial operating conditions (typically &#8805;150&#8201;&#176;C), &#8804;150&#8197;ppmv of I2). Due to the highly dispersed and readily accessible binding sites as well as sufficient accommodating space, the constructed NKPOC&#8208;DT&#8208;(I&#8722;) (NKPOC=Nankai porous organic cage) demonstrates a record&#8208;high I2 uptake capacity of 48.35&#8197;wt&#8201;% and extraordinary adsorption capacity of unit ionic site (~1.62) at 150&#8201;&#176;C and 150&#8197;ppmv of I2. The I2 capacity is 3.5, 1.6, and 1.3&#8197;times higher than industrial silver&#8208;based adsorbents Ag@MOR and benchmark materials of TGDM and 4F&#8208;iCOF&#8208;TpBpy&#8208;I&#8722; under the same conditions. Furthermore, NKPOC&#8208;DT&#8208;(I&#8722;)Me exhibits remarkable adsorption kinetics (k1=0.013&#8197;min&#8722;1), which is 1.2 and 1.6&#8197;times higher than TGDM and 4F&#8208;iCOF&#8208;TpBpy&#8208;I&#8722; under the identical conditions. NKPOC&#8208;DT&#8208;(I&#8722;)Me thus sets a new benchmark for industrial radioactive I2 adsorbents. This work not only provides a new insight for effectively enhancing the adsorption capacity of unit functional sites, but also advances POC as an efficient platform for radioiodine capture in industry.

         <title>Mesoporous Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Heteroatom&#8208;Tuned Crystallinity and Photocatalytic Behaviors</title>

Three mesoporous vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) derived from a methylthiazolyl&#8208;based monomer were built up by Knoevenagel condensation. Their crystallinity and semiconducting properties could be fine tuned by embedding heteroatoms into the backbones, which resulted in significantly different visible&#8208;light photocatalytic activities.







Abstract
Owing to its prominent &#960;&#8208;delocalization and stability, vinylene linkage holds great merits in the construction of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with promising semiconducting properties. However, carbon&#8208;carbon double bond formation reaction always exhibits relatively low reversibility, unfavorable for the formation of high crystalline frameworks through self&#8208;error correction and assembling processes. In this work, we report a heteroatom&#8208;tuned strategy to build up a series of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) vinylene&#8208;linked COFs by Knoevenagel condensation of an electron&#8208;deficient methylthiazolyl&#8208;based monomer with different triformyl substituted (hetero&#8722;)aromatic derivatives. The resulting COFs show high&#8208;quality periodic mesoporous structures with high surface areas. Embedding heteroatoms into the backbones enables significantly improving their crystallinity, and finely tailoring their semiconducting structures. Upon visible light stimulation, one of the as&#8208;prepared COFs with donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor structure could deliver a nearly seven&#8208;fold increase in the catalytic activity of hydrogen generation as compared with the other two. Meanwhile, in combination with high crystallinity and the matched conduction band energy level, such kind of COFs can be able to selectively generate singlet oxygen and superoxide radicals in a high ratio of up to 30&#8201;:&#8201;1, allowing for catalyzing aerobic thioanisole oxidation in distinctly tunable activities through the substituent electronic effect of the substrates.

         <title>Membrane&#8208;Free Electrocatalytic Co&#8208;Conversions of PBS Waste Plastics and Maleic Acid into High&#8208;Purity Succinic Acid Solid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A membrane&#8208;free co&#8208;production system was devised to produce succinic acid (SA) at both anode and cathode respectively by the co&#8208;electrolysis of polybutylene succinate (PBS) waste plastics and biomass&#8208;derived maleic acid (MA). The high&#8208;purity SA solid can be obtained by a carbon dioxide&#8208;assisted sequential precipitation approach.







Abstract
Plastic pollution, an increasingly serious global problem, can be addressed through the full lifecycle management of plastics, including plastics recycling as one of the most promising approaches. System design, catalyst development, and product separation are the keys in improving the economics of electrocatalytic plastics recycling. Here, a membrane&#8208;free co&#8208;production system was devised to produce succinic acid (SA) at both anode and cathode respectively by the co&#8208;electrolysis of polybutylene succinate (PBS) waste plastics and biomass&#8208;derived maleic acid (MA) for the first time. To this end, Cr3+&#8208;Ni(OH)2 electrocatalyst featuring much enhanced 1,4&#8208;butanediol (BDO) oxidation reaction (BOR) activity has been synthesized and the role of doped Cr has been revealed as an &#8220;electron puller&#8221; to accelerate the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) in the Ni2+/Ni3+ cycling. Impressively, an extra&#8208;high SA production rate of 3.02&#8197;g&#8197;h&#8722;1 and ultra&#8208;high apparent Faraday efficiency towards SA (FEapparent=181.5&#8201;%) have been obtained. A carbon dioxide&#8208;assisted sequential precipitation approach has been developed to produce high&#8208;purity SA and byproduct NaHCO3 solids. Preliminary techno&#8208;economic analysis demonstrates that the reported system is economically profitable and promising for future industrial applications.

         <title>Halogen Bond Unlocks Ultra&#8208;High Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The halogen aliovalent substitution of the Cl&#8722; anion with a I+ cation results in the formation of an [O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N] halogen bond, which then bridges &#960;&#8208;conjugated groups to form a novel halogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular framework, INA. This crystal exhibits a record&#8208;high birefringence (&#916;nexp.=0.778@550&#8197;nm), making it a promising candidate for high&#8208;performance optical devices such as polarizers, isolators, and phase retarders.







Abstract
Anisotropy is crucial for birefringence (&#916;n) in optical materials, but optimizing it remains a formidable challenge (&#916;n &gt;0.3). Supramolecular frameworks incorporating &#960;&#8208;conjugated components are promising for achieving enhanced birefringence because of their structural diversity and inherent anisotropy. Herein, we first synthesized (C6H6NO2)+Cl&#8722; (NAC) and then constructed a halogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular framework I+(C6H4NO2)&#8722; (INA) by halogen aliovalent substitution of Cl&#8722; with I+. The organic moieties are protonated and deprotonated nicotinic acid (NA), respectively. The antiparallel arrangement of birefringent&#8208;active units in NAC and INA leads to significant differences in the bonding characteristics between the interlayer and intralayer domains. Moreover, the [O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N] halogen bond in 1D [I+(C6H4NO2)&#8722;] chain exhibits stronger interactions and stricter directionality, resulting in a more pronounced in&#8208;plane anisotropy between the intrachain and interchain directions. Consequently, INA exhibits exceptional birefringent performance, with a value of 0.778 at 550&#8197;nm, twice that of NAC (0.363 at 550&#8197;nm). This value significantly exceeds those of commercial birefringent crystals, such as CaCO3 (0.172 at 546&#8197;nm), and is the highest reported value among ultraviolet birefringent crystals. This work presents a novel design strategy that employs halogen bonds as connection sites and modes for birefringent&#8208;active units, opening new avenues for developing high&#8208;performance birefringent crystals.

         <title>Frenkel and Charge&#8208;Transfer Excitonic Couplings Strengthened by Thiophene&#8208;Type Solvent Enables Binary Organic Solar Cells with 19.8&#8201;% Efficiency</title>

Frenkel and charge&#8208;transfer excitonic couplings at donor:acceptor interfaces strengthened by 2&#8208;chlorothiophene (2Cl&#8722;Th) solvent promote exciton splitting and reduce non&#8208;radiative voltage loss in organic solar cells. Finally, in 2Cl&#8722;Th treated cells, the champion efficiencies of 19.8&#8201;% (small&#8208;area) with superior operational reliability (T80: 586&#8197;hours) and 17.0&#8201;% (large&#8208;area) were yielded.







Abstract
Overcoming the trade&#8208;off between short&#8208;circuited current (Jsc) and open&#8208;circuited voltage (Voc) is important to achieving high&#8208;efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs). Previous works modulated the energy gap between Frenkel local exciton (LE) and charge&#8208;transfer (CT) exciton, which served as the driving force of exciton splitting. Differently, our current work focuses on the modulation of LE&#8208;CT excitonic coupling (tLE&#8208;CT) via a simple but effective strategy that the 2&#8208;chlorothiophene (2Cl&#8722;Th) solvent utilizes in the treatment of OSC active&#8208;layer films. The results of our experimental measurements and theoretical simulations demonstrated that 2Cl&#8722;Th solvent initiates tighter intermolecular interactions with non&#8208;fullerene acceptor in comparison with that of traditional chlorobenzene solvent, thus suppressing the acceptor's over&#8208;aggregation and retarding the acceptor crystallization with reduced trap. Critically, the resulting shorter distances between donor and acceptor molecules in the 2Cl&#8722;Th treated blend efficiently strengthen tLE&#8208;CT, which not only promotes exciton splitting but also reduces non&#8208;radiative recombination. The champion efficiencies of 19.8&#8201;% (small&#8208;area) with superior operational reliability (T80: 586&#8197;hours) and 17.0&#8201;% (large&#8208;area) were yielded in 2Cl&#8722;Th treated cells. This work provided a new insight into modulating the exciton dynamics to overcome the trade&#8208;off between Jsc and Voc, which can productively promote the development of the OSC field.

The results of our experimental measurements and theoretical simulations demonstrated that 2Cl&#8722;Th solvent initiates tighter intermolecular interactions with non-fullerene acceptor in comparison with that of traditional chlorobenzene solvent, thus suppressing the acceptor's over-aggregation and retarding the acceptor crystallization with reduced trap. Critically, the resulting shorter distances between donor and acceptor molecules in the 2Cl&#8722;Th treated blend efficiently strengthen t&lt;sub&gt;LE-CT&lt;/sub&gt;, which not only promotes exciton splitting but also reduces non-radiative recombination. The champion efficiencies of 19.8&#8201;% (small-area) with superior operational reliability (T80: 586&#8197;hours) and 17.0&#8201;% (large-area) were yielded in 2Cl&#8722;Th treated cells. This work provided a new insight into modulating the exciton dynamics to overcome the trade-off between &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;sc&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt;, which can productively promote the development of the OSC field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Facilitating Formate Selectivity via Optimizing eg* Band Broadening in NiMn Hydroxides for Ethylene Glycol Electro&#8208;Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, structural distortions in Ni(OH)2 induced by Mn doping can effectively modulate its electronic states around the Fermi level. It was found that Mn doping could lead to the broadening of eg* band, which enhanced the performance of EGOR. Product analysis and DFT calculations revealed that the adsorption of key intermediates of glyoxal was enhanced by eg* band broadening, resulting in the formate selectivity enhancement and inhibition of Cannizzaro reaction that generating glycolate by&#8208;product. These insights into the electronic state regulation of catalysts significantly advance the design of highly selective and efficient Ni(OH)2&#8208;based electrocatalysts, paving the way for future innovations in the development of electrocatalysts for alcohol oxidation.







Abstract
Ethylene glycol electro&#8208;oxidation reaction (EGOR) on nickel&#8208;based hydroxides (Ni(OH)2) represents a promising strategy for generating value&#8208;added chemicals, i.e. formate and glycolate, and coupling water&#8208;electrolytic hydrogen production. The high product selectivity was one of the most significant area of polyols electro&#8208;oxidation process. Yet, developing Ni(OH)2&#8208;based EGOR electrocatalyst with highly selective product remains a challenge due to the unclear cognition about the EGOR mechanism. Herein, Mn&#8208;doped Ni(OH)2 catalysts were utilized to investigate the EGOR mechanism. Experimental and calculation results reveal that the electronic states of eg* band play an important role in the catalytic performance and the product selectivity for EGOR. Broadening the eg* band could effectively enhance the adsorption capacity of glyoxal intermediates. On the other hand, this enhanced adsorption could lead to reduced side reactions associated with glycolate formation, simultaneously promoting the cleavage of C&#8722;C bonds. Consequently, the selectivity for formate was notably augmented by these enhancements. This work offers new insights into the regulation of catalyst electronic states for improving polyol electrocatalytic activity and product selectivity.

         <title>Redox Concomitant Formation Method for Fabrication of Cu(I)&#8722;MOF/Polymer Composites with Antifouling Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method called Redox Concomitant Formation (RCF) is presented for the fabrication of Cu(I) metal&#8211;organic frameworks polypyrrole (Cu(I)&#8722;MOF/PPy) composite. The monomer, as a molecular scalpel, reduces Cu(II) sites into Cu(I) sites while polymerizing as molecular sutures protecting in situ phase transition. Owing to the steady release of Cu+ ions and exceptional photothermal ability, Cu(I)&#8722;MOF/PPy exhibits superior antifouling properties.







Abstract
Marine biofouling, which is one of the technical challenges hindering the growth of the marine economy, has been controlled using cuprous oxide (Cu2O) nanoparticles due to the exceptional antifouling properties of Cu(I) ions. However, Cu2O nanoparticles have encountered bottlenecks due to explosive releases of Cu+ ions, high toxicity at elevated doses, and long&#8208;term instability. Here, we present a novel method called Redox Concomitant Formation (RCF) for fabricating a hierarchical Cu(I) metal&#8211;organic framework polypyrrole (Cu(I)&#8722;MOF/PPy) composite. This method enables in situ phase transition via successive redox reactions that change the chemical valence state and coordination mode of Cu(II)&#8722;MOF, resulting in a new structure of Cu(I)&#8722;MOF while creating a PPy layer surrounded by the hierarchical structure. Owing to the steady release of Cu+ ions from the Cu(I) sites and photothermal properties of PPy, Cu(I)&#8722;MOF/PPy exhibits superior and broad&#8208;spectrum resistance to marine bacteria, algae, and surface&#8208;adhered biofilms in complex biological environments, as well as long&#8208;term stability, resulting in 100&#8201;% eradication efficiency under solar&#8208;driven heating. Mechanistic insights into successive structural redox reactions and formation using the RCF method are provided in detail, enabling the fabrication of novel MOFs with the desired composition and structure for a wide range of potential applications.

         <title>Hidden Impurities Generate False Positives in Single Atom Catalyst Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>

The research addresses a critical issue in the characterization of single&#8208;atom catalysts, namely the challenge of correctly identifying and distinguishing impurities and active sites at the atomic scale.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are an emerging class of materials, leveraging maximum atom utilization and distinctive structural and electronic properties to bridge heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis. Direct imaging methods, such as aberration&#8208;corrected high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy, are commonly applied to confirm the atomic dispersion of active sites. However, interpretations of data from these techniques can be challenging due to simultaneous contributions to intensity from impurities introduced during synthesis processes, as well as any variation in position relative to the focal plane of the electron beam. To address this matter, this paper presents a comprehensive study on two representative SACs containing isolated nickel or copper atoms. Spectroscopic techniques, including X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, were employed to prove the high metal dispersion of the catalytic atoms. Employing scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging combined with single&#8208;atom&#8208;sensitive electron energy loss spectroscopy, we scrutinized thin specimens of the catalysts to provide an unambiguous chemical identification of the observed single&#8208;atom species and thereby distinguish impurities from active sites at the single&#8208;atom level. Overall, the study underscores the complexity of SACs characterization and establishes the importance of the use of spectroscopy in tandem with imaging at atomic resolution to fully and reliably characterize single&#8208;atom catalysts.

Cell vesicles displaying high&#8208;mannose modified anti&#8208;CD47 nanobody enable the boost of macrophage&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity for enhanced cancer suppression by synergizing the checkpoint blockade and glycan&#8208;mediated interactions.







Abstract
Immune checkpoint blockade targeting the CD47/SIRP&#945; axis represents an alluring avenue for cancer immunotherapy. However, the compromised efficacy and safety concerns in vivo of conventional anti&#8208;CD47 antibodies impede their wide clinical applications. Here we introduced a single type of high&#8208;mannose glycans into the nanobody against CD47 (HM&#8208;nCD47) and subsequently displayed HM&#8208;nCD47 on cellular vesicles (CVs) for enhanced cancer immunotherapy. In this platform, the CVs significantly improved the circulation time of HM&#8208;nCD47&#8208;CVs, the nCD47 enabled the blockade of the CD47/SIRP&#945; axis, and the HM enhanced recognition of mannose&#8208;binding lectin, all synergistically activating the macrophage&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity. In both subcutaneous and metastatic murine tumor models, the HM&#8208;nCD47&#8208;CVs possessed significantly extended half&#8208;lives and increased accumulation at the tumor site, resulting in a remarkable macrophage&#8208;dependent inhibition of tumor growth, a transcriptomic remodeling of the immune response, and an increase in survival time. By integrating the chemical biology toolbox with cell membrane nanotechnology, the HM&#8208;nCD47&#8208;CVs represent a new immunotherapeutic platform for cancer and other diseases.

         <title>Development of Organ Targeting Lipid Nanoparticles with Low Immunogenicity and Their Application in the Treatment of Pulmonary Fibrosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organ targeting lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) with low immunogenicity were developed as novel gene delivery platforms by incorporating Dex (dLNPs) to alleviate side effects induced by traditional LNPs. Lung&#8208;targeting dLNPs delivered siRUNX1 for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis with superior therapeutic performance owing to the synergy of gene and drug therapy. They provide a blueprint for the design of RNA therapeutics with higher efficacy and safety.







Abstract
As the most advanced non&#8208;viral delivery system, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) were approved by the FDA, propelling the advancements of gene therapy. However, their clinical applications are hampered by the potential immunogenicity of the lipid components that trigger immune&#8208;related adverse events, like inflammation and allergy. Herein, we formulate various dLNPs with diminished immunogenicity by incorporating dexamethasone (Dex) into liver&#8208;, spleen&#8208;, and lung&#8208;targeting LNPs formulations that exhibit excellent abilities to target specific organs and deliver various types of RNA, such as mRNA and siRNA. In vivo investigations demonstrate unparalleled advantages in safety as compared to conventional LNPs, showing promising potential in the development of RNA therapeutics. Intriguingly, the encapsulation of runt&#8208;related transcription factor&#8208;1 siRNA (siRUNX1) into lung&#8208;targeting dLNPs (dLNPs@siRUNX1) demonstrates remarkable advantages in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis through the synergy of gene therapy and drug therapy. This research establishes secure and universal platforms for the precise delivery of nucleic acid therapeutics, showcasing promising clinical applications in gene therapy.

         <title>Modulating the Bader Charge Transfer in Single p&#8208;Block Atoms Doped Pd Metallene for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precisely controlling the Bader charge transfer between Pd surface and oxygenated intermediates (*OO) via p&#8208;d electronic interaction on single&#8208;atom p&#8208;block metal doped Pd metallene (M&#8722;Pd metallene, M=In, Sn, Pb, Bi) with only 4&#8211;5 atomic layers thickness enable efficient and stable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for high&#8208;performance zinc&#8208;air batteries.







Abstract
Metallene is considered as an emerging family of electrocatalysts due to its atomically layered structure and unique surface stress. Here we propose a strategy to modulate the Bader charge transfer (BCT) between Pd surface and oxygenated intermediates via p&#8208;d electronic interaction by introducing single&#8208;atom p&#8208;block metal (M=In, Sn, Pb, Bi) into Pd metallene nanosheets towards efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). X&#8208;ray absorption and photoelectron spectroscopy suggests that doping p&#8208;block metals could facilitate electron transfer to Pd sites and thus downshift the d&#8208;band center of Pd and weaken the adsorption energy of O intermediates. Among them, the developed Bi&#8722;Pd metallene shows extraordinarily high ORR mass activity of 11.34&#8197;A&#8201;mgPd&#8722;1 and 0.86&#8197;A&#8201;mgPd&#8722;1 at 0.9&#8197;V and 0.95&#8197;V in alkaline solution, respectively, representing the best Pd&#8208;based ORR electrocatalysts ever reported. In the cathode of a Zinc&#8208;air battery, Bi&#8722;Pd metallene could achieve an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.546&#8197;V and keep stable for 760&#8197;h at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Theoretical calculations suggest that the BCT between Pd surface and *OO intermediates greatly affects the bond length between them (dPd&#8208;*OO) and Bi doping could appropriately reduce the amount of BCT and stretch the dPd&#8208;*OO, thus enhancing the ORR activity.

         <title>Palladium(0) and Br&#248;nsted Acid Co&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Hydro&#8208;Cyclization of 2,4&#8208;Dienyl Hydrazones and Oximes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective hydro&#8208;cyclization reaction of 2,4&#8208;dienyl hydrazones and oximes has been developed, through Pd0 and Br&#248;nsted acid co&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;regioselective protonation followed by intramolecular allylic amination or etherification. A broad collection of dihydropyrazoles and dihydroisoxazoles, respectively, are constructed with moderate to excellent enantioselectivity, which can be elaborated to furnish multifunctional building blocks.







Abstract
The transition metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydro&#8208;functionalization of 1,3&#8208;dienes has been well explored, but most reactions focus on electron&#8208;neutral substrates in an intermolecular manner. Here we first demonstrate that readily available 2,4&#8208;dienyl hydrazones and oximes can be efficiently utilized in the hydro&#8208;cyclization reaction under co&#8208;catalysis of a Br&#248;nsted acid and a chiral palladium complex, furnishing multifunctional dihydropyrazones and dihydroisoxazoles, respectively. Diverse substitution patterns for both types of electron&#8208;deficient diene compounds are tolerated, and corresponding heterocycles were generally constructed with moderate to excellent enantioselectivity, which can be elaborated to access products with higher molecular complexity and diversity. Control experiments and density functional theory calculations support that &#945;&#8208;regioselective protonation of dienyl substrates by acid and concurrent &#960;&#8208;Lewis base activation of Pd0 complex is energetically favoured in the formation of active &#960;&#8208;allylpalladium intermediates, and an outer&#8208;sphere allylic amination or etherification mode is adopted to deliver the observed cyclized products enantioselectively.

         <title>Mechanochemically Promoted Functionalization of Postconsumer Poly(Methyl Methacrylate) and Poly(&#945;&#8208;Methylstyrene) for Bulk Depolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a methodology of post&#8208;polymerization functionalization to enable bulk depolymerization by chemically recycling to monomer utilizing mechanochemical macro&#8208;radical generation. When sonicated in the presence of a depolymerizable trigger, postconsumer PMMA and PAMS can achieve up to 82&#8201;% depolymerization. High&#8208;purity monomer is collected and used in new materials. This method of functionalization is particularly effective with Mn&gt;1&#8197;million kg/mol polymers, offering a sustainable solution for plastic waste management.







Abstract
We describe a methodology of post&#8208;polymerization functionalization to enable subsequent bulk depolymerization to monomer by utilizing mechanochemical macro&#8208;radical generation. By harnessing ultrasonic chain&#8208;scission in the presence of N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide methacrylate (PhthMA), we successfully chain&#8208;end functionalize polymers to promote subsequent depolymerization in bulk, achieving up to 82 % depolymerization of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and poly(&#945;&#8208;methylstyrene) (PAMS) within 30&#8197;min. This method of depolymerization yields a high&#8208;purity monomer that can be repolymerized. Moreover, as compared to the most common methods of depolymerization, this work is most efficient with ultra&#8208;high molecular weight (UHMW) polymers, establishing a method with the potential to address highly persistent, non&#8208;degradable all&#8208;carbon backbone plastic materials. Lastly, we demonstrate the expansion of this depolymerization method to commercial cell cast PMMA, achieving high degrees of depolymerization from post&#8208;consumer waste. This work is the first demonstration of applying PhthMA&#8208;promoted depolymerization strategies in homopolymer PMMA and PAMS prepared by conventional polymerization methods.

         <title>Visualization of Electrooxidation on Palladium Single Crystal Surfaces via In Situ Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed schematic of the entire electrooxidation reaction pathway on the Pd single crystal surface can be outlined by obtaining the direct spectroscopic evidence of *OH and *OO intermediates via in situ Raman spectroscopy. Moreover, it is found that surface&#8208;adsorbed ClO4&#8722; ions can facilitate the deprotonation process of *OH and accelerate the electrooxidation process.







Abstract
The electrooxidation of catalyst surfaces is across various electrocatalytic reactions, directly impacting their activity, stability and selectivity. Precisely characterizing the electrooxidation on well&#8208;defined surfaces is essential to understanding electrocatalytic reactions comprehensively. Herein, we employed in situ Raman spectroscopy to monitor the electrooxidation process of palladium single crystal. Our findings reveal that the Pd surface's initial electrooxidation process involves forming *OH intermediate and ClO4&#8722; ions facilitate the deprotonation process, leading to the formation of PdOx. Subsequently, under deep electrooxidation potential range, the oxygen atoms within PdOx contribute to creating surface&#8208;bound peroxide species, ultimately resulting in oxygen generation. The adsorption strength of *OH and the coverage of ClO4&#8722; can be adjusted by the controllable electronic effect, resulting in different oxidation rates. This study offers valuable insights into elucidating the electrooxidation mechanisms underlying a range of electrocatalytic reactions, thereby contributing to the rational design of catalysts.

         <title>Photoinduced Electron Donor Acceptor Complex&#8208;Enabled &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H Alkenylation of Amines</title>

         <dc:description>
A general, mild, operationally simple, and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H alkenylation of various readily available cyclic, acyclic, and benzo&#8208;fused cyclic amines with a series of alkenylborate esters to prepare allylic amines was developed. This protocol features a broad substrate scope, excellent functional group tolerance, high E/Z and diastereoselectivities, and good compatibility with water and oxygen. Mechanistic studies suggest that the success of this chemistry relies on the formation of a photoactive electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex between 2&#8208;iodobenzamide and the tetraalkoxyborate anion.







Abstract
Allylic amines are prevalent and vital structural components present in many bioactive compounds and natural products. Additionally, they serve as valuable intermediates and building blocks, with wide&#8208;ranging applications in organic synthesis. However, direct &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H alkenylation of feedstock amines, particularly for the preparation of &#945;&#8208;alkenylated cyclic amines, has posed a longstanding challenge. Herein, we present a general, mild, operationally simple, and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free &#945;&#8208;alkenylation of various readily available amines with alkenylborate esters in excellent E/Z &#8208; and diastereoselectivities. This method features good compatibility with water and oxygen, broad substrate scope, and excellent functional group tolerance, thereby enabling the late&#8208;stage modification of various complex molecules. Mechanistic studies suggest that the formation of a photoactive electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex between 2&#8208;iodobenzamide and the tetraalkoxyborate anion, which subsequently undergoes photoinduced single electron transfer and intramolecular 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer to generate the crucial &#945;&#8208;amino radicals, is the key to success of this chemistry.

         <title>Zero&#8208;Bias Anti&#8208;Ohmic Behaviour in Diradicaloid Molecular Wires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular conductance increases with length at a significant rate in a series of bis(indeno)acene molecular wires. The rapid shrinking of the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap induced by the singlet diradicaloid character of these compounds is responsible for the observed behaviour. These results pave the way to long&#8208;range, efficient coherent tunnelling charge transport.







Abstract
Open&#8208;shell materials bearing multiple spin centres provide a key route to efficient charge transport in single&#8208;molecule electronic devices. They have narrow energy gaps, and their molecular orbitals align closely to the Fermi level of the metallic electrodes, thus allowing efficient electronic transport and higher conductance. Maintaining and stabilising multiple open&#8208;shell states&#8212;especially in contact with metallic electrodes&#8212;is however very challenging, generally requiring a continuous chemical or electrochemical potential to avoid self&#8208;immolation of the open&#8208;shell character. To overcome this issue, we designed, synthesised, and measured the conductance of a series of bis(indeno) fused acenes, where stability is imparted by a close&#8208;shell quinoidal conformation in resonance with the diradical electronic configuration. We show here that these compounds have anti&#8208;ohmic behaviour, with conductance increasing with increasing molecular length, at an unprecedented rate and across the entire bias window (

&#177;1.3V

 ${\pm 1.3\ V}$



). Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations support our findings, showing the rapidly narrowing HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, unique to these diradicaloid structures, is responsible for the observed behaviour. Our results provide a framework for achieving efficient transport in neutral compounds and demonstrate the promise that diradicaloid materials have in single&#8208;molecule electronics, owing to their great stability and unique electronic structure.

         <title>Upcycling of Spent LiFePO4 Cathodes to Heterostructured Electrocatalysts for Stable Direct Seawater Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging P and Fe from spent LiFePO4 cathodes, in situ generated PO43&#8722; and NiOOH/Fe3(PO4)2 heterointerfaces effectively inhibit chlorine oxidation while promoting OH&#8722; adsorption and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) through electrostatic modulation. The resulting catalyst demonstrates exceptional OER activity and durability in alkaline seawater.







Abstract
The pursuit of carbon&#8208;neutral energy has intensified the interest in green hydrogen production from direct seawater electrolysis, given the scarcity of freshwater resources. While Ni&#8208;based catalysts are known for their robust activity in alkaline water oxidation, their catalytic sites are prone to rapid degradation in the chlorine&#8208;rich environments of seawater, leading to limited operation time. Herein, we report a Ni(OH)2 catalyst interfaced with laser&#8208;ablated LiFePO4 (Ni(OH)2/L&#8208;LFP), derived from spent Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), as an effective and stable electrocatalyst for direct seawater oxidation. Our comprehensive analyses reveal that the PO43&#8722; species, formed around L&#8208;LFP, effectively repels Cl&#8722; ions during seawater oxidation, mitigating corrosion. Simultaneously, the interface between in situ generated NiOOH and Fe3(PO4)2 enhances OH&#8722; adsorption and electron transfer during the oxygen evolution reaction. This synergistic effect leads to a low overpotential of 237&#8197;mV to attain a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and remarkable durability, with only a 3.3&#8201;% activity loss after 600&#8197;h at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline seawater. Our findings present a viable strategy for repurposing spent LIBs into high&#8208;performance catalysts for sustainable seawater electrolysis, contributing to the advancement of green hydrogen production technologies.

A subtle molecular bridging strategy is proposed to enhance the compatibility between PVA and ZnSO4 from the perspective of hydrogen&#8208;bonding microenvironment re&#8208;construction. The urea molecules adsorbed on electrode are electropolymerized under voltage to form organic SEI. Such SEI functions as a binder, stabilizing the electrode interface and promoting uniform Zn deposition. Additionally, this SEI layer effectively mitigates side reactions, thereby enhancing the overall electrochemical performance and durability of the electrode.







Abstract
Hydrogel electrolytes (HEs) hold great promise in tackling severe issues emerging in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries, but the prevalent salting&#8208;out effect of kosmotropic salt causes low ionic conductivity and electrochemical instability. Herein, a subtle molecular bridging strategy is proposed to enhance the compatibility between PVA and ZnSO4 from the perspective of hydrogen&#8208;bonding microenvironment re&#8208;construction. By introducing urea containing both an H&#8208;bond acceptor and donor, the broken H&#8208;bonds between PVA and H2O, initiated by the SO42&#8722;&#8208;driven H2O polarization, could be re&#8208;united via intense intermolecular hydrogen bonds, thus leading to greatly increased carrying capacity of ZnSO4. The urea&#8208;modified PVA&#8208;ZnSO4 HEs featuring a high ionic conductivity up to 31.2&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 successfully solves the sluggish ionic transport dilemma at the solid&#8208;solid interface. Moreover, an organic solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase can be derived from the in situ electro&#8208;polymerization of urea to prohibit H2O&#8208;involved side reactions, thereby prominently improving the reversibility of Zn chemistry. Consequently, Zn anodes witness an impressive lifespan extension from 50&#8197;h to 2200&#8197;h at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 while the Zn&#8208;I2 full battery maintains a remarkable Coulombic efficiency (&gt;99.7&#8201;%) even after 8000 cycles. The anti&#8208;salting&#8208;out strategy proposed in this work provides an insightful concept for addressing the phase separation issue of functional HEs.

         <title>Modulating Hydrogen Adsorption by Unconventional p&#8211;d Orbital Hybridization over Porous High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Metallene for Efficient Electrosynthesis of Nylon&#8208;6 Precursor</title>

         <dc:description>
A porous high&#8208;entropy alloy PdCuAgBiIn metallene was synthesized and demonstrated high performance for electrosynthesis of cyclohexanone oxime (C6H11NO). Experimental and theoretical studies validated that unconventional p&#8208;d orbital hybridization could tune the local electronic structure of active sites to manipulate active hydrogen supply, which facilitates the generation and enrichment of key intermediates and promotes the formation of C6H11NO.







Abstract
Renewable electricity driven electrosynthesis of cyclohexanone oxime (C6H11NO) from cyclohexanone (C6H10O) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) is a promising alternative to traditional environment&#8208;unfriendly industrial technologies for green synthesis of C6H11NO. Precisely controlling the reaction pathway of the C6H10O/NOx&#8208;involved electrochemical reductive coupling reaction is crucial for selectively producing C6H11NO, which is yet still challenging. Herein, we report a porous high&#8208;entropy alloy PdCuAgBiIn metallene (HEA&#8208;PdCuAgBiInene) to boost the electrosynthesis of C6H11NO from C6H10O and nitrite, achieving a high Faradaic efficiency (47.6&#8201;%) and almost 100&#8201;% yield under ambient conditions. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations demonstrate that unconventional orbital hybridization between d&#8208;block metals and p&#8208;block metals could regulate the local electronic structure of active sites and induce electron localization of electron&#8208;rich Pd sites, which tunes the active hydrogen supply, facilitates the generation and enrichment of key intermediates NH2OH* and C6H10O*, and efficiently promotes their C&#8722;N coupling to selectively produce C6H11NO.

         <title>Aldehyde End&#8208;Capped Degradable Polyethylenes From Hydrogen&#8208;Controlled Ethylene/CO Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from three large&#8208;scale feedstocks of ethylene + carbon monoxide + hydrogen, direct hydrogen&#8208;controlled non&#8208;alternating copolymerization of CO and ethylene produces aldehyde end&#8208;capped polyethylene (PE) materials with in&#8208;chain isolated keto group, whose molecular weight and chain endgroup could be modulated by H2. Such semicrystalline PE could undergo photodegradation to oily derivatives.







Abstract
To access degradable polyolefin plastic, non&#8208;alternating copolymerization of ethylene (E) and carbon monoxide (CO) for producing polyethylene (PE) with in&#8208;chain ketones is particularly appealing; however, it still presents significant challenges such as molecular weight modulation (hydrogen response) and chain endgroup control (functional terminal). In this study, we achieved hydrogen&#8208;controlled E/CO non&#8208;alternating copolymerization using late transition metal catalysts. This process results in linear PEs containing the desired non&#8208;alternating in&#8208;chain keto groups (1.0&#8211;9.3&#8197;mol&#8201;%) and with tunable molecular weights ranging from 43 to 195&#8197;kDa. In this reaction, H2 serves as a chain transfer agent, modulating the polymer's molecular weight, forming unique aldehyde endgroups and eliminating usual olefinic endgroups; CO undergoes non&#8208;alternating insertion into the PE chain, resulting in a strictly non&#8208;alternating structure (&gt;99&#8201;%) for the keto&#8208;PE. The dispersed incorporation of in&#8208;chain keto groups retains bulk properties of PE and makes PE susceptible to photodegradation, which produces significantly lower molecular weight polymers and oligomers with unambiguous vinyl and acetyl terminals.

         <title>A Renal Clearable Nano&#8208;Assembly with F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer Amplified Superoxide Radical and Heat Generation to Overcome Hypoxia Resistance in Phototherapeutics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dyad phthalocyanine&#8208;based nanotheranostic (NanoPcSZ) with boosted superoxide radical (O2&#8226;&#8208;) and heat generation was developed based on F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer mechanism. Such nanotheranostic can be eliminated through the kidneys and excreted from the body via urine, and ultimately achieving a notable therapeutic effect with high biosafety.







Abstract
Given that type I photosensitizers (PSs) possess a good hypoxic tolerance, developing an innovative tactic to construct type I PSs is crucially important, but remains a challenge. Herein, we present a smart molecular design strategy based on the F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) mechanism to develop a type I photodynamic therapy (PDT) agent with an encouraging amplification effect for accurate hypoxic tumor therapy. Of note, benefiting from the FRET effect, the obtained nanostructured type I PDT agent (NanoPcSZ) with boosted light&#8208;harvesting ability not only amplifies superoxide radical (O2&#8226;&#8208;) production but also promotes heat generation upon near&#8208;infrared light irradiation. These features facilitate NanoPcSZ to realize excellent phototherapeutic response under both normal and hypoxic environments. As a result, both in vitro and in vivo experiments achieved a remarkable improvement in therapeutic efficacy via the combined effect of photothermal action and type I photoreaction. Notably, NanoPcSZ can be eliminated from organs (including the liver, lung, spleen, and kidney) apart from the tumor site and excreted through urine within 24&#8197;h of its systemic administration. In this way, the potential biotoxicity of drug accumulation can be avoided and the biosafety can be further enhanced.

         <title>Tuning the Inter&#8208;Metal Interaction between Ni and Fe Atoms in Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts to Boost CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distance effect and inter&#8208;metal interaction of dual&#8208;atom catalysts in electrochemical CO2 reduction are demonstrated. The NiFe&#8208;N bridge catalyst with NiN4 and FeN4 sharing two N atoms exhibits superior activity compared to the NiFe&#8208;isolate and NiFe&#8208;bonding configurations. The N&#8208;bridged NiFe sites with an appropriate distance of around 2.7&#8197;&#197; facilitate the adsorption of *COOH and promote the desorption of *CO, thus enhancing the performance.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) are promising for applications in electrochemical CO2 reduction due to the enhanced flexibility of the catalytic sites and the synergistic effect between dual atoms. However, precisely controlling the atomic distance and identifying the dual&#8208;atom configuration of DACs to optimize the catalytic performance remains a challenge. Here, the Ni and Fe atomic pairs were constructed on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support in three different configurations: NiFe&#8208;isolate, NiFe&#8208;N bridge, and NiFe&#8208;bonding. It was found that the NiFe&#8208;N bridge catalyst with NiN4 and FeN4 sharing two N atoms exhibited superior CO2 reduction activity and promising stability when compared to the NiFe&#8208;isolate and NiFe&#8208;bonding catalysts. A series of characterizations and density functional theory calculations suggested that the N&#8208;bridged NiFe sites with an appropriate distance between Ni and Fe atoms can exert a more pronounced synergy. It not only regulated the suitable adsorption strength for the *COOH intermediate but also promoted the desorption of *CO, thus accelerating the CO2 electroreduction to CO. This work provides an important implication for the enhancement of catalysis by the tailoring of the coordination structure of DACs, with the identification of distance effect between neighboring dual atoms.

         <title>How Can Materials Chemists Contribute to Food Supply Security in the Age of AI and Robotics?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Viewpoint describes the unexpected, underexplored, but essential ways in which the materials chemistry community can contribute to securing the global food supply as it is coming under increasing duress. The piece provides a large number of open fundamental questions for the community to tackle, as well as examples from the recent literature.







Abstract
Global factors are compromising the security of the food supply. Many of us in our community might be unsure about how to help with our seemingly inapplicable expertise. In this piece, I describe how materials chemistry and materials chemists will be essential in addressing this problem, but not only in the way we might think. There is a gigantic and largely unexplored opportunity for real societal impact if we accept a broader view of what academic materials chemistry can be.

         <title>Back Cover: Hidden Impurities Generate False Positives in Single Atom Catalyst Imaging (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 44/2024)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isolated metal atoms of a single&#8208;atom catalyst are represented on the cover as distinct dots, reflecting their usual appearance under a microscope. However, as detailed in the Research Article by Gianvito Vil&#233;, Sean M. Collins et&#8197;al. (e202404883), hidden impurities can lead to false positives in imaging. Accurate differentiation between active catalytic sites (in black) and impurities (in blue) can only be achieved by combining microscopy with in situ electron energy loss spectroscopy, which sets new standards for advanced detection techniques in single&#8208;atom catalysis.

         <title>Cover Picture: Mutualistic Synthesis from Orthogonal Dynamic Covalent Reactions (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 44/2024)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mutualistic synthesis concept via orthogonal chemical reactions (disulfide and hydrazone exchange) is reported by Jianwei Li et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202412020). The cover picture describes a "handcuffs" catenane that is formed by a tetrameric disulfide macrocycle and a linear hydrazone. Both species were formed as minor products when the reactions occurred independently, while the mutualistic co&#8208;amplification led to their formation in higher amounts.

Aza&#8208;superbenzene and aza&#8208;supernaphthalene are prepared by Chunyan Chi and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202407990). Both compounds can be oxidized into higher oxidation states. The dication and tetracation of aza&#8208;superbenzene exhibit global anti&#8208;aromaticity and aromaticity, respectively, with a dominant 32&#960; and 30&#960; conjugation pathway. For aza&#8208;supernaphthalene, its dication, tetracation and hexacation display global aromaticity, antiaromaticity, and aromaticity, respectively, with a 54&#960;, 52&#960;, and 50&#960; conjugation pathway.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Remote C&#8722;H Functionalization: Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions and Reversibly Bound Templates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilization of non&#8208;covalent interactions has now become the vogue in C&#8722;H bond functionalization chemistry. Exploration of such diverse interactions such as hydrogen bonding, Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions etc. and their subsequent integration with palladium catalysis becomes pivotal in redefining the sustainability aspects associated with transition metal catalysis. The precise engineering of templates and their diligent correlation with respect to the substrate, becomes the cornerstone in these strategies.







Abstract
Pd&#8208;catalysis has stood as a pivotal force in synthetic transformations for decades, maintaining its status as a paramount tool in the realm of C&#8722;H bond activation. While functionalization at proximal positions has become commonplace, achieving selective and sustainable access to distal positions continues to captivate scientific endeavors. Recently, a noteworthy trend has emerged, focusing on the utilization of non&#8208;covalent interactions to address the challenges associated with remote functionalization. The integration of these non&#8208;covalent interactions into palladium catalysis stands as a justified response to the demands of achieving selective transformations at distal positions. This review delves into the latest advancements and trends surrounding the incorporation of non&#8208;covalent interactions within the field of palladium catalysis. Furthermore, it is noteworthy to emphasize that multifunctional templates, particularly those harnessing hydrogen bonding, present an elegant and sophisticated approach to activate C&#8722;H bonds in a highly directed fashion. These templates showcase versatility and demonstrate potential applications across diverse contexts within the area of remote functionalization.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Triggered Debonding of Mussel&#8208;Inspired Pressure Sensitive Adhesives: Improving Efficiency Through Functional Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiol&#8208;catechol&#8208;connectivities (TCC) can be employed to form strong adhesive polymers, which are debondable by an oxidative trigger. The properties of such polymers can be tuned via the backbone of the monomers. Here, a nature&#8208;inspired peptidic biscatechol is compared to a fossil&#8208;based analogue. The catechol&#8208;amide interactions exhibited by the dipeptide allow for a more efficient debonding mechanism, outperforming the plain catechol oxidation variant.







Abstract
Debondable pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives (PSAs) promise access to recyclability in microelectronics in the transition toward a circular economy. Two PSAs were synthesized from a tetravalent thiol star&#8208;polyester forming thiol&#8208;catechol&#8208;connectivities (TCC) with either the biorelated DiDopa&#8208;bisquinone (BY*Q) or the fossil&#8208;based bisquinone A (BQA). The PSAs enable debonding by oxidation of TCC&#8208;catechols to quinones. The extent of debonding efficiency depends on the interaction modes, which are determined by the chemical structure differences of both TCC&#8208;motifs. BY*Q&#8208;TCC&#8208;PSA debonds with exceptional loss of 99&#8201;% of its approx. 2&#8197;MPa shear strength in glass&#8208;on&#8208;glass junctions. For BQA&#8208;TCC&#8208;PSA, a debonding efficiency of only approx. 60&#8201;% was found, irrespective of its initial shear strength, which could be tuned up to approx. 7&#8197;MPa. The efficiency of debonding for BY*Q&#8208;TCC&#8208;PSA after TCC&#8208;oxidation is linked to the loss of synergistic interactions without strongly affecting the bulk glue properties, outperforming the purely catechol&#8208;based BQA&#8208;analogue.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Enabled Droplet Biobattery for Powering Synthetic Tissues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A droplet biobattery built from nanolitre droplets, fuelled by the enzyme&#8208;enabled oxidation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, generates electrical outputs and powers ion fluxes in droplet networks. The enzyme&#8208;enabled droplet biobattery opens new avenues in bioelectronics and bioiontronics, exemplified by tasks such as the ability to drive chemical signalling when integrated into synthetic tissues.







Abstract
Enzyme&#8208;enabled biobatteries are promising green options to power the next&#8208;generation of bioelectronics and implantable medical devices. However, existing power sources based on enzymatic biofuel chemistry exhibit limited scale&#8208;down feasibility due to the solid and bulky battery structures. Therefore, miniature and soft alternatives are needed for integration with implants and tissues. Here, a biobattery built from nanolitre droplets, fuelled by the enzyme&#8208;enabled oxidation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, generates electrical outputs and powers ion fluxes in droplet networks. Optimization of the droplet biobattery components ensures a stable output current of ~13,000&#8197;pA for over 24&#8197;h, representing a more than 600&#8208;fold increase in output over previous approaches, including light&#8208;driven processes. The enzyme&#8208;enabled droplet biobattery opens new avenues in bioelectronics and bioiontronics, exemplified by tasks such as the ability to drive chemical signal transmission in integrated synthetic tissues.

Here, a biobattery built from nanolitre droplets, fuelled by the enzyme-enabled oxidation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, generates electrical outputs and powers ion fluxes in droplet networks. Optimization of the droplet biobattery components ensures a stable output current of ~13,000&#8197;pA for over 24&#8197;h, representing a more than 600-fold increase in output over previous approaches, including light-driven processes. The enzyme-enabled droplet biobattery opens new avenues in bioelectronics and bioiontronics, exemplified by tasks such as the ability to drive chemical signal transmission in integrated synthetic tissues.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Asymmetric Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Aminoimines from 1,2&#8208;Bis&#8208;N&#8208;Sulfinylimines by Using Allyl Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first direct asymmetric synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aminoimines is achieved employing chiral bis&#8208;sulfinylimines and allylboronic acids. The exclusive monoallylation occurred at room temperature with complete stereodivergence. The reactivity difference of the spare imine toward allylboronic acids and metal&#8208;based nucleophiles, is a major highlight of this protocol. Chiral 1,2&#8208;diamines and &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles were readily accessed from &#945;&#8208;aminoimines.







Abstract
A unique direct asymmetric synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aminoimines is realized, through rapid and exclusive mono&#8208;allylation of chiral bis&#8208;N&#8208;sulfinylimines using allylboronic acids. The highly selective allylation was possible as electrophilic imine functional group in the product &#945;&#8208;aminoimines remained unreactive towards allyl boronic acid nucleophiles. Notably, by varying the geometry and chiral auxiliary, all four isomers of the &#945;&#8208;aminoimines were accessed from readily available precursors. A range of allyl nucleophiles, which are tricky to generate by other means possessing highly reactive functional groups also took part in this reaction, expanding the scope further. The applicability of the products &#945;&#8208;aminoimines were further demonstrated by accessing a range of structurally diverse chiral cyclic and acyclic 1,2&#8208;diamines bearing adjacent stereocenters through addition of a second nucleophile or Prins&#8208;type cyclization by exploiting the nucleophilicity of the tethered alkene moiety. Moreover, the leaving group aptitude of sulfinyl auxiliary attached to imine, was exploited to access valuable chiral &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles under thermal conditions without employing any reagents. Detailed DFT calculation revealed a chair&#8208;like transition state, arising from corresponding allylboroxine species, likely operating for the allylboration reaction across imine.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Catalytic Structural Isomerisation as a Route to &#945;&#8208;Arylated Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, dual catalytic method for the structural isomerisation of easy&#8208;to&#8208;make tertiary allylic alcohols into &#945;&#8208;arylated ketones is reported. Applications of this straightforward approach include a two&#8208;step homologation of diaryl ketone drug molecules.







Abstract
Isomerisation reactions provide streamlined routes to organic compounds which are otherwise hard to directly synthesise. The most common forms are positional, geometrical or stereochemical isomerisations which involve the relocation of a double bond or a change in relative location of groups in space. In contrast, far fewer examples of structural (or constitutional) isomerisation exist where the connectivity between atoms is altered. The development of platforms capable of such rearrangement poses a unique set of challenges because chemical bonds must be selectively cleaved, and new ones formed without overall addition or removal of atoms. Here, we show that a dual catalytic system can enable the structural isomerisation of readily available allylic alcohols into more challenging&#8208;to&#8208;synthesise &#945;&#8208;arylated ketones via a H&#8208;atom transfer initiated semi&#8208;pinacol rearrangement. Key to our strategy is the combination of a cobalt catalyst and photocatalyst under reductive, protic conditions which allows intermediates to propagate catalytic turnover. By providing an unusual disconnection to structural motifs which are difficult to access through direct arylation, we anticipate inspiring other advanced catalytic isomerisation strategies that will further retrosynthetic logic for complex molecule synthesis.

         <title>Subsets of Nanometer Vesicles in the Fly Release Differential Fractions of Vesicular Serotonin Content during Exocytosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Serotonin from neurons inside the ventral nerve cord of Drosophila melanogaster was measured using nanoelectrochemical approaches. Differential release fractions were observed upon drug treatment. This is the first example of consistent full release found in any system, suggesting the possibility for one pool of vesicles to release significantly diverse fractions of transmitter load during exocytosis.







Abstract
Serotonin, a monoamine neurotransmitter, is important in both the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system. Malfunction of serotonin signaling leads to various disorders. We studied serotonin signaling from serotonergic neurons inside the ventral nerve cord of Drosophila melanogaster. Serotonergic neurons and stimulated release were visualized and achieved with mCherry and channelrhodopsin&#8208;2 (an optogenetically transfected ion channel), respectively, and two electrochemical techniques quantified serotonin release and vesicular content. Mean vesicular serotonin content released during exocytosis from these neurons was 84&#8201;%, considerably higher than reported in previous studies regarding octopamine (4.5&#8201;%) and glutamate release (31&#8201;%). Serotonin content within all vesicles is uniformly changed when serotonin concentration is inhibited or enhanced. However, serotonin release exhibits two Gaussian distributions: higher frequency of small release events, and similar or slightly higher frequency of large events, resulting in differential release fractions ranging from partial (13&#8211;18&#8201;%) to full (100&#8201;%) release after treatment with agents to either enhance or diminish release. This is the first example of consistent full exocytotic release events we have observed in any system. We suggest one pool of vesicles can release significantly diverse fractions of transmitter load during exocytosis, a potentially novel pathway to regulate exocytosis and neuronal signaling.

         <title>Radical 6&#8208;Endo Addition Enables Pyridine Synthesis under Metal&#8208;Free Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first radical 6&#8208;endo addition strategy to synthesize pyridines under metal&#8208;free conditions is reported. Experimental and computational studies indicate the critical roles of hypervalent iodine(III) for the 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig addition rather than 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig addition to afford pyridines.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free synthesis of heterocycles is highly sought after in the pharmaceutical industry and has garnered widespread attention due to eliminating the need to remove trace metal catalysts from the reaction. We report a radical 6&#8208;endo addition method for pyridine synthesis from cyclopropylamides and alkynes under metal&#8208;free conditions. Various terminal and substituted alkynes are inserted as C2&#8197;units into cyclopropylamides to synthesize versatile pyridines with 57 examples. Mechanistic investigations and computational studies indicate the unprecedented 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig addition of vinyl radicals to the imine nitrogen atom rather than the conventional 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig addition to the imine carbon atom, in which the hypervalent iodine(III) plays a critical role. This reaction easily scales up with excellent functional group compatibility and suits the late&#8208;stage pyridine installation on complex molecules.

         <title>Optimizing the Intermediates Adsorption by Manipulating the Second Coordination Shell of Ir Single Atoms for Efficient Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents Ir single atoms anchored on NiO via different bonding strategies, resulting in diverse Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Ni coordination numbers for Ir sites. The OER activity exhibited a volcano&#8208;shaped relationship with the Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Ni coordination number. The improved activity of Ir1&#8722;NiO was attributed to the moderate coordination number of Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Ni, which weakened the adsorption strength for *OOH intermediates.

The precise regulation of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with the desired local chemical environment is vital to elucidate the relationship between the SACs structure and the catalytic performance. The debate on the effect of the local coordination environment is quite complicated even for the SACs with the same composition and chemical nature, calling for increased attention on the regulation of the second coordination shell. For oxide&#8208;supported SACs, it remains a significant challenge to precisely manipulate the second coordination shell of single atoms supported on oxides due to the structural robustness of oxides. Here, Ir single atoms were anchored on NiO supports via different bonding strategies, resulting in the diverse Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Ni coordination numbers for Ir sites. Specifically, Ir1/NiO, Ir1&#8722;NiO, and Ir1@NiO SACs with increasing Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Ni coordination numbers of 3, 4, and 5 were synthesized, respectively. We found that the activity of the three samples towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) exhibited a volcano&#8208;shaped relationship with the Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Ni coordination number, with Ir1&#8722;NiO showing the lowest overpotential of 225&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Mechanism investigations indicate that the moderate coordination number of Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Ni in Ir1&#8722;NiO creates the higher occupied Ir dz2 orbital, weakening the adsorption strength for *OOH intermediates and thereby enhancing the OER activity.

         <title>Simultaneous Material and Chemical Recycling of Waste PET/PE Multi&#8208;Layer Films under Hydrothermal Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we propose a hydrothermal process equipped with two filters for recycling PET/PE (PET: Polyethylene terephthalate; PE: Polyethylene) multi&#8208;layer films. At 300&#8201;&#176;C and 10&#8197;MPa, around 100&#8201;% of PET is hydrolyzed to monomers of terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG). Meanwhile, PE, TPA, and EG are collected separately using the same system, indicating the simultaneous material and chemical recycling of PET/PE films is firstly achieved.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;layer plastic films are widely used in various fields especially for packaging, but due to complex composition, it is very difficult to recover single&#8208;material polymers or high&#8208;purity monomers from them after usage. In this study, we proposed a hydrothermal process for recycling PET/PE (PET: Polyethylene terephthalate; PE: Polyethylene) films. PET can be hydrolyzed to monomers of terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG). Using a hydrothermal system equipped with two filters, PE, TPA, and EG were collected separately, indicating the simultaneous material and chemical recycling of PET/PE films was firstly achieved. At 300&#8201;&#176;C and 10&#8197;MPa for 60&#8197;min, PET conversion reached around 100&#8201;%, and TPA yield of 83.0&#8201;% was obtained with a high TPA purity of 96.1&#8201;%. In addition, the effect of the holding time on PET conversion, TPA yield, EG yield, and TPA purity was studied. This research opened up a new and sustainable pathway to recycle multi&#8208;layer plastic films in both lab and industry.

         <title>Spatial&#8208;coupled Ampere&#8208;level Electrochemical Propylene Epoxidation over RuO2/Ti Hollow&#8208;fiber Penetration Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ampere&#8208;level propylene epoxidation reaction (PER) is achieved over RuO2/Ti hollow&#8208;fiber penetration electrode (HPE) in a membraneless reactor, in virtue of the synergetic combination of both the penetration effect and the spatial&#8208;coupling strategy, exhibiting specificity propylene oxide (PO) production of over 80&#8201;% PO faradaic efficiency (FEPO) and a maximum 859&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 PO partial current density (jPO), with significant potentials for economically viable PER applications.







Abstract
The electrochemical propylene epoxidation reaction (PER) provides a promising route for ecofriendly propylene oxide (PO) production, instantly generating active halogen/oxygen species to alleviate chloride contamination inherent in traditional PER. However, the complex processes and unsatisfactory PO yield for current electrochemical PER falls short of meeting industrial application requirements. Herein, a spatial&#8208;coupling strategy over RuO2/Ti hollow&#8208;fiber penetration electrode (HPE) is adopted to facilitate efficient PO production, significantly improving PER performance to ampere level (achieving over 80&#8201;% PO faradaic efficiency and a maximum PO current density of 859&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The synergetic combination of the penetration effect of HPE and the spatial&#8208;coupled reaction sequence, enables the realization of ampere&#8208;level PO production with high specificity, exhibiting significant potentials for economically viable PER applications.

         <title>Asymmetric Cu&#8722;N1O3 Sites Coupling Atop&#8208;type and Bridge&#8208;type Adsorbed *C1 for Electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2 Conversion</title>

         <dc:description>
Asymmetric Cu&#8722;N1O3 site leads to the re&#8208;distribution of local electron structure and the regulation of adsorption strength of several key adsorbates, reaching the simultaneous atop&#8208;type (on Cu site) and bridge&#8208;type (on Cu&#8722;N site) adsorption of *C1 for electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2 conversion.







Abstract
2D functional porous frameworks offer a platform for studying the structure&#8211;activity relationships during electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Yet challenges still exist to breakthrough key limitations on site configuration (typical M&#8722;O4 or M&#8722;N4 units) and product selectivity (common CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion). Herein, a novel 2D metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with planar asymmetric N/O mixed coordinated Cu&#8722;N1O3 unit is constructed, labeled as BIT&#8208;119. When applied to CO2RR, BIT&#8208;119 could reach a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2 conversion with C2 partial current density ranging from 36.9 to 165.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in flow cell. Compared to the typical symmetric Cu&#8722;O4 units, asymmetric Cu&#8722;N1O3 units lead to the re&#8208;distribution of local electron structure, regulating the adsorption strength of several key adsorbates and the following catalytic selectivity. From experimental and theoretical analyses, Cu&#8722;N1O3 sites could simultaneously couple the atop&#8208;type (on Cu site) and bridge&#8208;type (on Cu&#8722;N site) adsorption of *C1 species to reach the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2 conversion. This work broadens the feasible C&#8722;C coupling mechanism on 2D functional porous frameworks.

The artificial photosynthesis with a photoanode of two&#8208;electron water oxidation into H2O2 and a photocathode of H2 by one sun illumination as the only energy input was developed on Sb2S3 photoelectrodes.







Abstract
The productions of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydrogen (H2) in a photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting cell suffer from an onset potential that limits solar conversion efficiencies. Moreover, the formation of H2O2 through two&#8208;electron PEC water oxidation reaction competes with four&#8208;electron oxidation evolution reaction. Herein, we developed the surface selenium doped antimony trisulfide photoelectrode with the integrated ruthenium cocatalyst (Ru/Sb2(S,Se)3) to achieve the low onset potential and high Faraday efficiency (FE) for selective H2O2 production. The photoanode exhibits an outstanding average FE of 85&#8201;% in the potential range of 0.4&#8211;1.6&#8197;VRHE and the H2O2 yield of 1.01&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;min&#8722;1 at 1.6&#8197;VRHE, especially at low potentials of 0.1&#8211;0.55&#8197;VRHE with 80.4&#8201;% FE. Impressively, an unassisted PEC system that employs light and electrolyte was constructed to simultaneously produce H2O2 and H2 production on both the Ru/Sb2(S,Se)3 photoanode and the Pt/TiO2/Sb2S3 photocathode. The integrated system enables the average PEC H2O2 production rate of 0.637&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;min&#8722;1 without applying any addition bias. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that Sb2S3&#8208;based photoelectrodes exhibit H2O2/H2 two&#8208;side production with a strict key factor of the system, which represents its powerful platform to achieve high efficiency and productivity and the feasibility to facilitate value&#8208;added products in neutral conditions.

         <title>Mutualistic Synthesis from Orthogonal Dynamic Covalent Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a mutualistic synthesis concept via orthogonal chemical reactions: disulfide and hydrazone exchange. A tetrameric macrocycle from the active disulfide exchange catalyzed the otherwise inert hydrazone exchange, amplifying a linear hydrazone and forming &#8220;handcuffs&#8221; catenanes through noncovalent binding. The co&#8208;amplification of both species resembles mutualism in ecosystems, as they were minor species when the reactions occurred independently.







Abstract
Mutualisms are interactions that benefit all species involved. It has been widely investigated in neighbouring subjects, such as biology, ecology, sociology, and economics. However, such a reciprocal relationship in synthetic chemical systems has rarely been studied. Here, we demonstrate a mutualistic synthesis where byproducts from two orthogonal chemical reactions aid each other&#8242;s production. Disulfide exchange and hydrazone exchange were chosen to generate two dynamic combinatorial libraries. A minor tetrameric macrocycle from the active disulfide library was quantitatively amplified in the presence of the hydrazone library. This incorporation also turned on the previously inert hydrazone reaction, producing a linear species that formed a &#8220;handcuffs&#8221; catenane with the disulfide tetramer. These findings not only lend robust support to the hypothesis of &#8220;RNA&#8208;peptide coevolution&#8221; for the origin of life but also broaden the scope of synthetic chemistry, highlighting the untapped potential of minor products from different reactions. Additionally, the co&#8208;self&#8208;assembly of these mutualistic entities to form supramolecular structures opens new avenues for future development of composite nanosystems with synergistic properties.

         <title>Radiocatalytic Synthesis of Acetic Acid from CH4 and CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The C&#8722;C coupling of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) to generate acetic acid (CH3COOH) represents a highly atom&#8208;efficient chemical conversion, fostering the comprehensive utilization of greenhouse gases. This study reveals that hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) and hydrated electrons (eaq&#8722;) produced by water radiolysis can effectively activate CH4 and CO2, yielding methyl radicals (&#8901;CH3) and carbon dioxide radical anions (&#8901;CO2&#8722;) that facilitate the production of CH3COOH at ambient temperature. The introduction of radiation&#8208;synthesized CuO&#8208;anchored TiO2 bifunctional catalyst could further enhance reaction efficiency and selectivity remarkably by boosting radiation absorption and radical stability, resulting in a concentration of 7.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1 of CH3COOH with high selectivity (&gt;95&#8201;%).







Abstract
The C&#8722;C coupling of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) to generate acetic acid (CH3COOH) represents a highly atom&#8208;efficient chemical conversion, fostering the comprehensive utilization of greenhouse gases. However, the inherent thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness of CH4 and CO2 present obstacles to achieving efficient and selective conversion at room temperature. Our study reveals that hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) and hydrated electrons (eaq&#8722;) produced by water radiolysis can effectively activate CH4 and CO2, yielding methyl radicals (&#8901;CH3) and carbon dioxide radical anions(&#8901;CO2&#8722;) that facilitate the production of CH3COOH at ambient temperature. The introduction of radiation&#8208;synthesized CuO&#8208;anchored TiO2 bifunctional catalyst could further enhance reaction efficiency and selectivity remarkably by boosting radiation absorption and radical stability, resulting in a concentration of 7.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1 of CH3COOH with near&#8208;unity selectivity (&gt;95&#8201;%). These findings offer valuable insights for catalyst design and implementation in radiation&#8208;induced chemical conversion.

         <title>Path&#8208;Independent All&#8208;Visible Orthogonal Photoswitching for Applications in Multi&#8208;Photochromic Polymers and Molecular Computing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;visible, all&#8208;light responsive, and path&#8208;independent orthogonal photoswitching has been achieved by combining peri&#8208;anthracenethioindigo and a rhodanine&#8208;based photoswitch. Four persistent colors can be interchanged by irradiation with light and could be transferred to a multi&#8208;photochromic transparent polymer material. The addition of a third fluorophore component enables advanced all&#8208;photonic logic operations.







Abstract
Synthetic molecular photoswitches have taken center stage as high&#8208;precision tools to introduce light&#8208;responsiveness at the smallest scales. Today they are found in all areas of applied chemistry, covering materials research, chemical biology, catalysis, or nanotechnology. For a next step of applicability truly orthogonal photoswitching is highly desirable but to date such independent addressability of different photoswitches remains highly challenging. Herein we present the first example of all&#8208;visible, all&#8208;light responsive, and path&#8208; independent orthogonal photoswitching. By combining two recently developed indigoid photoswitches &#8208; peri&#8208;anthracenethioindigo and a rhodanine&#8208;based chromophore &#8208; a four&#8208;state system is established and each state can be accessed in high yields completely independently and also with visible light irradiation only. The four states give rise to four different colors, which can be transferred to a solid polymer matrix to yield a versatile multi&#8208;state photochromic material. Further, combination with a fluorescent dye as a third component is possible, demonstrating the applicability of this orthogonal photoswitching system in all&#8208;photonic molecular logic behavior and information processing.

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Euphordraculoate A and Pedrolide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric total syntheses of euphordraculoate A and pedrolide were accomplished through a cascade involving Eu&#8208;promoted dienyl enolization, intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, and enol&#8208;ketone tautomerization. This cascade is consistent with our proposal for the biogenetic relationship between euphordraculoate A and pedrolide.







Abstract
Here we report the asymmetric total syntheses of two rearranged tigliane diterpenoids, euphordraculoate A and pedrolide. A reductive dihydroxylation cascade and Nazarov cyclization were performed to generate euphordraculoate A, which was subjected to a cascade of Eu&#8208;promoted dienyl enolization, intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction and enol&#8208;ketone tautomerization to afford pedrolide, a pathway consistent with our proposal for the biogenesis of pedrolide.

         <title>Synthesis of 1&#8208;Azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes via Formal Single Electron Reduction of Azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes under Photochemical Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general synthesis of 1&#8208;azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (1&#8208;aza&#8208;BCH) starting from azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (ABB) and styrenes under photochemical conditions is reported. The reaction follows a polar&#8208;radical&#8208;polar relay strategy in which the key step is a photocatalytic atom&#8208;transfer&#8208;radical&#8208;addition (ATRA) reaction.







Abstract
C(sp3)&#8208;rich heterocycles are privileged building blocks for pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Therefore, synthetic methods that provide access to novel saturated nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles are in high demand. Herein, we report a general synthesis of 1&#8208;azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (1&#8208;aza&#8208;BCH) via a formal cycloaddition of azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (ABB) with styrenes under photochemical conditions. To overcome the challenging direct single electron reduction of ABBs, we designed a polar&#8208;radical&#8208;polar relay strategy that leverages a fast acid&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;opening of ABBs to form bromoazetidines, which undergo efficient debrominative radical formation to initiate the cycloaddition reaction. The reaction is applicable to a broad range of ABB&#8208;ketones and we demonstrate the 1&#8208;aza&#8208;BCH products can be further functionalized to access larger saturated, conformationally rigid heterocycles.

         <title>Piezo&#8208;catalysis Mechanism Elucidation by Tracking Oxygen Reduction to Hydrogen Peroxide with In situ EPR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative in situ EPR monitoring strategy is introduced to investigate the active species involved in the ORR&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2 pathways by electro&#8208;, photo&#8208; and piezo&#8208;catalysis. The formation of immediate species in piezo&#8208;catalysis is more inclined towards photo&#8208;catalysis rather than electro&#8208;catalysis, offering prospective evidence to support the choice of mechanism for piezo&#8208;catalysis.







Abstract
For piezoelectric catalysis, the catalytic mechanism is a topic of great controversy, with debates centered around whether it belongs to the energy band theory or the screening charge effect which are similar to mechanisms of photocatalysis and electrochemical catalysis, respectively. Due to the formation of different intermediate active&#8208;species during two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) via electro&#8208; and photo&#8208;catalysis, the key to solving this problem is precisely monitoring the active species involved in ORR during electro&#8208;, photo&#8208;, and piezo&#8208;catalysis under identical condition. Here, a semiconductor material, BiOBr with abundant oxygen vacancies (BOB&#8208;OV) was found remarkable catalytic activity in H2O2 production by all three catalytic methods. By employing in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, the H2O2 evolution pathway through piezo&#8208;catalysis over BOB&#8208;OV was monitored, which showed a similar reaction pathway to that observed in photo&#8208;catalytic process. This finding represents solid evidence supporting the notion that piezo&#8208;catalytic mechanism of ORR is more inclined towards photo&#8208;catalysis rather than electro&#8208;catalysis. Significantly, this exploratory conclusion provides insight to deepen our understanding of piezo&#8208;catalysis.

         <title>A Double&#8208;walled Noncovalent Carbon Nanotube by Columnar Packing of Nanotube Fragments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis of double&#8208;walled noncovalent carbon nanotubes (CNTs) through host&#8211;guest complexation of nanotube fragments and tube&#8208;forming crystal engineering. As the smallest fragment of double&#8208;walled CNTs, a host&#8211;guest complex of perfluorocycloparaphenylene (PFCPP) and carbon nanobelt (CNB) was synthesized by mixing them in solvents. The immediate complexation of the PF[12]CPP&#8835;(6,6)CNB complex with a remarkably high association constant (Ka) of 2&#215;105 L/mol was observed. Time&#8208;dependent 1H NMR and thermogravimetry measurements revealed that the stability of (6,6)CNB was significantly improved by encapsulation. X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed the robust belt&#8208;in&#8208;ring structure of this complex. As indicated by the short distance between PF[12]CPP and (6,6)CNB (2.8 &#197;), intermolecular orbital interactions exist between the belt and the ring, which were further supported by theoretical calculation and phosphorescence quenching experiments. While the PF[12]CPP&#8835;(6,6)CNB complex adopts various crystal packing structures, chloroform was discovered to be a magic &#8220;glue&#8221; solvent inducing one&#8208;dimensional alignment of the PF[12]CPP&#8835;(6,6)CNB complex to build an unprecedented double&#8208;walled noncovalent CNT structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Anisotropic Hollow Structure with Chemotaxis Enabling Intratumoral Autonomic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Effective intratumoral drug penetration is pivotal for successful cancer treatment. However, due to the disrupted capillary networks and poor perfusion in solid tumors, there exist challenges to realize autonomous directional drug penetration and controlled drug release within the tumor. Considering the specificity of glucose within tumor tissue, we draw inspiration from nature and engineer asymmetrical hollow structures exhibiting chemotaxis towards high glucose levels. By incorporating multiple shells into these structures, we enhance the local chemical concentration gradients, thereby improving cellular uptake and precise targeting. The advantages of anisotropic hollow multishell structure (a&#8208;HoMS) can be reflected from the diffusion coefficient and directivity, which increase by 73.4% and 265% respectively compared to conventional isotropic hollow spheres, achieving the most linear movement while ensuring the speed of movement. Furthermore, the multi&#8208;level porosity and temporal&#8208;spatial order of a&#8208;HoMS enable sequential drug delivery that inhibits angiogenesis with inducing cell apoptosis. After the eradication of localized tumor cells, the a&#8208;HoMS can automatically migrate to the alive tumor cells under the glucose gradient, inducing another cycle of drug delivery and chemotaxis, resulting in excellent antitumor efficacy. These anisotropic HoMS demonstrate intelligence, adaptability, and precision in tumor therapy, providing valuable insights for programmable treatment within tissues.</dc:description>

         <title>A Structural and Functional Mimic of P680+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One or multiple chlorophyll molecules are employed in the reaction center of photosystem II's main electron donor (defined as P680). We have a poor understanding of how the reaction center facilitates water oxidation and the roles that mono&#8208; and/or multimeric chlorophyll groups play when P680 oxidizes a neighboring tyrosine in order to drive water oxidation at the oxygen evolving complex. We have prepared a dimeric MgII&#8208;porphyrin complex [Mg2(BTPP)] (1, H4&#8208;BTPP = 1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;(10,15,20&#8208;triphenylporphyrin&#8208;5&#8208;yl)&#8208;benzene) as a structural and functional mimic of the dimeric core of P680. 1 was oxidized by one&#8208;electron to the corresponding &#960;&#8208;cation radical complex 2. The radical cation was characterized by UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR, FT&#8208;IR, and EPR spectroscopic techniques. 2 was shown to be reactive towards phenols to give the corresponding phenoxyl radicals, mimicking the reactivity of the P680 cation radical which oxidizes tyrosine to tyrosyl radical. Critically, the dimeric &#960;&#8208;cation radical showed markedly higher rates of proton coupled electron transfer oxidation (PCET) of phenols when compared to its monomeric counterpart [Mg(TPP)] (TPP = 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin). Our findings demonstrate that MgII&#8208;porphyrin complexes are reliable mimics of photosynthetic PCET processes and suggest that photosynthetic reaction centers with multiple &#960;&#8208;conjugated complexes likely lower the barrier to PCET oxidation by &#960;&#8208;cation radical species.</dc:description>

         <title>Tricyanomethane or Dicyanoketenimine&#8212;Silylation makes the Difference</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first synthesis of a dicyanoketenimine, Me3Si&#8722;NC&#8722;C(CN)2, was achieved by introduction of a bulky Me3Si group, whereas the protonated species features the tricyanomethanide isomer HC(CN)3. Further silylation with [Me3Si&#8722;H&#8722;SiMe3][B(C6F5)4] led to the formation of an unusual persilylated dication [C(CN&#8722;SiMe3)3]2+ stabilized by a weakly coordinating anion.







Abstract
Pseudohalides such as tricyanomethanide, [C(CN)3]&#8722;, are well known in chemistry, biochemistry and industrial chemistry. The protonated species HC(CN)3, a classic hydrogen pseudohalide Br&#248;nsted acid, is a very strong acid with a pKa value of &#8722;5. However, HC(CN)3 is difficult to handle as it tends to decompose rapidly or, more precisely, to oligo&#8208; and polymerize. Therefore, silylated pseudohalide compounds with the [Me3Si]+ as the &#8220;big organometallic proton&#8221; have become interesting, exhibiting similar chemical properties but better kinetic protection. Here, the stepwise silylation of the pseudohalide anion [C(CN)3]&#8722; is reported, forming the heavier homologue of HC(CN)3, namely [Me3Si][C(CN)3], and in presence of two additional [Me3Si]+ cations even the dicationic species [(Me3Si&#8722;NC)3C]2+ as stable [B(C6F5)4]&#8722; salt. Surprisingly, in contrast to the protonated species HC(CN)3, in which the proton is bound to the central carbon atom of [C(CN)3]&#8722;, silylation of the [C(CN)3]&#8722; anion occurs at one of the three terminal nitrogen atoms, thus forming the long&#8208;sought dicyanoketenimine [Me3Si&#8722;NC&#8722;C(CN)2]. All further silylation steps take place exclusively on the terminal N atoms of the three CN groups and not on the central carbon atom, until the intriguing, highly symmetrical dication, [(Me3Si&#8722;NC)3C]2+, is finally generated. The experimental data are supported by quantum chemical calculations in terms of thermodynamics and chemical bonding.

         <title>Precise Manipulation of Electron Transfers in Clustered Five Redox Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a rational synthetic strategy afforded a series of heterometallic pentanuclear complexes, and the overall picture of the electron transfers in the complexes. In addition, the unique electron transfer behaviors, in which the reduction of a metal center occurs during the oxidation of the overall complex, were also identified. We also elucidated the two dominant factors that determine the manner of the electron transfers.







Abstract
Electron transfers in multinuclear metal complexes are the origin of their unique functionalities both in natural and artificial systems. However, electron transfers in multinuclear metal complexes are generally complicated, and predicting and controlling these electron transfers is extremely difficult. Herein, we report the precise manipulation of the electron transfers in multinuclear metal complexes. The development of a rational synthetic strategy afforded a series of pentanuclear metal complexes which composed of metal ions and 3,5&#8208;bis(2&#8208;pyridyl)pyrazole (Hbpp) as a platform to probe the phenomena. Electrochemical and spectroscopic investigations clarified overall picture of the electron transfers in the pentanuclear complexes. In addition, unique electron transfer behaviors, in which the reduction of a metal center occurs during the oxidation of the overall complex, were identified. We also elucidated the two dominant factors that determine the manner of the electron transfers. Our results provide comprehensive guidelines for interpreting the complicated electron transfers in multinuclear metal complexes.

         <title>Multimodal Molecular Motion in the Rotaxanes and Catenanes Incorporating Flexible Calix[n]phyrin Stations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of [2]rotaxanes stoppered with dipyrromethane has opened a route to rotaxanes and catenanes incorporating calix[4]phyrin units. A new type of molecular motion, termed fluttering, has been observed and simple chemical transformations such as methylation and (de)protonation of the [3]rotaxane and [2]catenane enables controllable transformations within the conformationally flexible mechanically interlocked compounds.







Abstract
The synthesis of [2]rotaxanes stoppered with one or two dipyrromethane groups has opened a route for the construction of mechanically interlocked molecules incorporating various porphyrinoid stations. The exploitation of those precursors allowed the creation of [3]rotaxanes and [2]catenanes based on the calix[4]phyrin motif, presenting intriguing molecular dynamics. The intrinsic flexibility of the porphyrinoid allowed the introduction of a new type of molecular motion within the rotaxanes, termed fluttering. The latter involved a bending of the axle, interconverting two angular&#8208;shaped stereoisomers of the rotaxane through a planarised transition state. Simple chemical transformations, i.e. methylation and (de)protonation of the [3]rotaxane and [2]catenane allowed controllable transformations within the conformationally flexible calix[4]phyrin&#8208;incorporated mechanically interlocked porphyrinoids.

         <title>Metallo&#8208;Supramolecular Helicates as Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) Substrates with High Tailorability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of benzochalcogenodiazole&#8208;based metallohelicates were synthesized and proven effective as substrates for surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) through systematic optimization of ligands and metals, achieving substantial Raman enhancement and highlighting their potential to advance SERS substrate innovation.







Abstract
The exploration of novel functionalized supramolecular coordination complexes (SCCs) can enable new applications in domains that include purification and sensing. In this study, employing a coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly strategy, we designed and prepared a series of benzochalcogenodiazole&#8208;based metallohelicates as high&#8208;efficiency charge&#8208;transfer surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates, expanding the range of applications for these metallohelicates. Through structural modifications, including the substitution of single heteroatoms on ligands, replacement of coordinating metals, and alteration of ligand framework linkages, the Raman performance of these metallohelicates as substrates were systematically optimized. Notably, the SERS enhancement factors (EFs) of the metallohelicate&#8208;based SERS substrates were significantly enhanced to levels as high as 1.03&#215;107, which rivals the EFs of noble metals devoid of &#8220;hot spots&#8221;. Additionally, the underlying Raman enhancement mechanisms of these metallohelicates have been investigated through a combination of control experiments and theoretical calculations. This study not only demonstrates the utility of metallohelicates as SERS substrates but also offers insights and materials for the development of high&#8208;efficiency new charge&#8208;transfer SERS substrates.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Ketoamides by Sulfonium Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8209;dicarbonyls remains a contemporary challenge in synthesis due to their tendency to undergo racemization via keto&#8208;enol tautomerization. Herein, we report a method to access enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;ketoamides by a chiral sulfinimine&#8208;mediated [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic sulfonium rearrangement. The transformation displays good chirality transfer, as well as excellent chemoselectivity and functional group tolerance. Diastereoselective reduction of the ketone moiety, also achievable in one&#8208;pot fashion, affords enantioenriched &#946;&#8209;hydroxyamides.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeted Genome Mining Facilitates the Discovery of a Promiscuous, Hyperthermostable Amidase from Thermovenabulum gondwanense with Notable Nylon&#8208;Degrading Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plastics are ubiquitous in our ecosystems, and microplastic accumulation in the environment is an emerging global health concern. Since available recycling technologies are not economically competitive with primary plastic production, global use is expected to reach 1231 megatons by 2060, with 493 megatons leeching into the environment each year. To identify new nylon&#8208;recycling biotechnologies, targeted genome mining was used to identify thermostable enzymes capable of degrading polyamides. Here, we describe the characterization of a novel protein sourced from Thermovenabulum gondwanense: TvgC. TvgC is extremely stable, exhibiting a melting temperature of 93 &#176;C and no detectable losses in hydrolytic activity after one week at 60 &#176;C. While nylonases primarily process nylon&#8208;6, TvgC catalysed the degradation of both nylon&#8208;6 and nylon&#8208;6,6 films, which are considerably more difficult to degrade. Finally, conversion experiments demonstrate that TvgC achieves a 1.2 wt% conversion of nylon&#8208;6 film, comparable to that of the most highly engineered nylonases. This novel hyperthermostable protein represents an excellent starting point for future engineering of increasingly efficient nylonases.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infinite&#8208;Chain Polymers with Ge=Ge Double Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite considerable interest in heteroatom&#8208;containing conjugated polymers, there are only few examples with heavier p&#8208;block elements in the conjugation path. The recently reported heavier acyclic diene metathesis (HADMET) allowed for the synthesis of a polymer containing Ge=Ge double bonds &#8211; albeit insoluble and with limited degree of polymerization. By incorporation of long alkyl chains, we now obtained soluble representatives, which exhibit degrees of polymerization near infinity according to diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Analyses of the UV/Vis absorption and the NMR spectroscopic data confirm the presence of &#963;,&#960;&#8208;conjugation across the silylene&#8208;phenylene linkers between the Ge=Ge double bonds. Favorable intermolecular dispersion interactions lead to ladder&#8208;like cylindrical supramolecular assemblies as confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), small angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and DLS. AFM and TEM images of deposited thin films reveal lamellar ordering of extended polymer bundles.</dc:description>

         <title>Label&#8208;Free Raman Probing of the Intrinsic Electric Field for High&#8208;Efficiency Screening of Electricity&#8208;Producing Bacteria at the Single&#8208;Cell Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fabrication of high&#8208;performance microbial fuel cells requires the evaluation of the activity of electrochemically active bacteria. However, this is challenging because of the time&#8208;consuming nature of biofilm formation and the invasive nature of labeling. To address this issue, we developed a fast, label&#8208;free, single&#8208;cell Raman spectroscopic method. This method involves investigating the &#8220;pure&#8221; linear Stark effect of endogenous CO in the silent region of biological samples, which allows for probing the intrinsic electric field in the outer&#8208;membrane cytochromes of live bacterial cells. We found that reduced outer&#8208;membrane cytochromes can generate an additional intrinsic electric field equivalent to an applied potential of +0.29 V. We also found that the higher the electrical activity of the cell, the larger the generated electric field. This was also reflected in the output current of the constructed microbial fuel cells. Raman spectroscopy was employed to facilitate the assessment of electrochemical activity at the single&#8208;cell level in highly&#8208;diluted bacterial samples. After analysis, inactive bacteria were ablated by laser heating, and 20 active cells were cultured for further testing. The rapid and high&#8208;throughput probing of the intrinsic electric field offers a promising platform for high&#8208;efficiency screening of electrochemically active bacterial cells for bioenergetic and photosynthetic research.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Sandwich&#8208;Structured Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Molecules Utilizing 11,12&#8208;Dihydroindolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazole as Bridge</title>

         <dc:description>
Novel efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence molecules with regular folded sandwich configurations are constructed using 11,12&#8208;dihydroindolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazole as bridge, xanthone as acceptor, and dibenzothiophene, dibenzofuran, 9&#8208;phenylcarbazole and indolo[3,2,1&#8208;JK]carbazole as donors. They can function efficiently as emitters in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, providing high electroluminescence efficiencies of up to 30.6&#8201;%.







Abstract
Constructing folded molecular structures is emerging as a promising strategy to develop efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials. Most folded TADF materials have V&#8208;shaped configurations formed by donors and acceptors linked on carbazole or fluorene bridges. In this work, a facile molecular design strategy is proposed for exploring sandwich&#8208;structured molecules, and a series of novel and robust TADF materials with regular U&#8208;shaped sandwich conformations are constructed by using 11,12&#8208;dihydroindolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazole as bridge, xanthone as acceptor, and dibenzothiophene, dibenzofuran, 9&#8208;phenylcarbazole and indolo[3,2,1&#8208;JK]carbazole as donors. They hold outstanding thermal stability with ultrahigh decomposition temperatures (556&#8211;563&#8201;&#176;C), and exhibit fast delayed fluorescence and excellent photoluminescence quantum efficiencies (86&#8201;%&#8211;97&#8201;%). The regular and close stacking of acceptor and donors results in rigidified molecular structures with efficient through&#8208;space interaction, which are conducive to suppressing intramolecular motion and reducing reorganized excited&#8208;state energy. The organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) using them as emitters exhibit excellent electroluminescence performances, with maximum external quantum efficiencies of up to 30.6&#8201;%, which is a leading value for the OLEDs based on folded TADF emitters. These results demonstrate the proposed strategy of employing 11,12&#8208;dihydroindolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazole as bridge for planar donors and acceptors to construct efficient folded TADF materials is applicable.

         <title>Understanding the Role of Spin State in Cobalt Oxyhydroxides for Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3d transition metal substitution can regulate the spin configuration of CoOOH, the intermediate state CoMnOOH has the largest lattice distortion, which contributes to the smallest energy gap between dxy and dz2 orbitals. The electron in high energy eg orbital is much easier to lose compared to that in t2g orbital, uncovering the spin configuration&#8208;dependent formation of high&#8208;valent OER&#8208;active *O&#8722;Co(IV) species during OER process.







Abstract
Although the electronic state of catalysts is strongly corrected with their oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances, understanding the role of spin state in dynamic electronic structure evolution during OER process is still challenging. Herein, we developed a spin state regulation strategy to boost the OER performance of CoOOH through elemental doping (CoMOOH, M=V, Cr, Mn, Co and Cu). Experimental results including magnetic characterization, in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ Raman and density functional theory calculations unveil that Mn doping could successfully increase the Co sites from low spin state to intermediate spin state, leading to the largest lattice distortion and smallest energy gap between dxy and dz2 orbitals among the obtained CoMOOH electrocatalysts. Benefiting from the promoted electron transfer from dxy to dz2 orbital, facilitated formation of active high&#8208;valent *O&#8722;Co(IV) species at applied potential, and reduced energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step, the CoMnOOH exhibits the highest OER performance. Our work provides significant insight into the correction between dynamic electronic structure evolution and OER performance by understanding the role of spin state regulation in metal oxyhydroxides, paving a new avenue for rational design of high&#8208;activity electrocatalysts.

         <title>Rapid Thermal Drying Synthesis of Nonthiolated Spherical Nucleic Acids with Stability Rivaling Thiolated DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By thermal drying, highly stable spherical nucleic acids with a high DNA density were synthesized using nonthiolated DNA, rivaling the performance of thiolated DNA. A poly&#8208;adenine block with as few as two consecutive terminal adenine bases is sufficient for anchoring on gold nanoparticles. Applications of nonthiolated SNAs were validated in both solution and paper&#8208;based sensors.







Abstract
Attaching DNA oligonucleotides to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to prepare spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) has offered tremendous insights into surface chemistry with resulting bioconjugates serving as critical reagents in biosensors and nanotechnology. While thiolated DNA is generally required to achieve stable conjugates, we herein communicate that using a thermal drying method, a high DNA density and excellent SNA stability was achieved using nonthiolated DNA, rivaling the performance of thiolated DNA such as surviving 1&#8197;M NaCl, 2 month stability in 0.3&#8197;M NaCl and working in 50&#8201;% serum. A poly&#8208;adenine block with as few as two consecutive terminal adenine bases is sufficient for anchoring on AuNPs. By side&#8208;by&#8208;side comparison with the salt&#8208;aging method, the conjugation mechanism was attributed to competitive adenine adsorption at high temperature along with an extremely high DNA concentration upon drying. Bioanalytical applications of nonthiolated SNAs were validated in both solution and paper&#8208;based sensor platforms, facilitating cost&#8208;effective applications for SNAs.

         <title>Bismuthenium Cations for the Transport of Chloride Anions via Pnictogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The search for main group derivatives that mediate chloride transport across phospholipid bilayers has led to the identification of chalcogen&#8208;supported diarylbismuthenium cations as suitable examples of such compounds. Deploying these water&#8208;stable cations in chloride&#8208;loaded vesicles shows that their transport properties can be adjusted by the strength of the chalcogen&#8594;bismuth interaction, as well as the overall lipophilicity of their structures.







Abstract
Our interest in the design of heavy pnictogen&#8208;based Lewis acids for anion trafficking across biological membrane mimics has led us to investigate trivalent bismuthenium cations as chloride anion transporters. Here, we describe two chlorodiarylbismuthines, elaborated on a peri&#8208;substituted naphthalene backbone and stabilized by an adjacent thio&#8208; or seleno&#8208;ether functionality that engages the bismuth center in a Ch&#8594;Bi interaction (Ch=chalcogen). These new derivatives are stable in aqueous environment and readiliy transport chloride anions across the membrane of phospholipid&#8208;based vesicles loaded with KCl. In addition to establishing the use of such motifs in anion transport, this investigation shows that the Lewis acidity, lipophilicity, and thus chloride transport properties depend on the nature of the chalcogen.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processable MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF System Constructed via Template&#8208;Assisted Growth for Ultratrace H2S Detection</title>

         <dc:description>
The stable Ni3(HITP)2/NUS&#8208;8 systems, synthesized via an innovative template&#8208;assisted approach, display high conductivity, porosity, and solution processability. Gas sensors utilizing these systems demonstrate significant sensitivity to ultratrace H2S at room temperature and outstanding selectivity. Additionally, wearable sensors integrating these systems can capture human motion signals, opening up new possibilities for such devices.







Abstract
Conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (c&#8208;MOFs) hold promise for highly sensitive sensing systems due to their conductivity and porosity. However, the fabrication of c&#8208;MOF thin films with controllable morphology, thickness, and preferential orientation remains a formidable yet ubiquitous challenge. Herein, we propose an innovative template&#8208;assisted strategy for constructing MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF (Ni3(HITP)2/NUS&#8208;8 (HITP: 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexamino&#8208;tri (p&#8208;phenylene))) systems with good electrical conductivity, porosity, and solution processability. Leveraging the 2D nature and solution processability of NUS&#8208;8, we achieve the controllable self&#8208;assembly of Ni3(HITP)2 on NUS&#8208;8 nanosheets, producing solution&#8208;processable Ni3(HITP)2/NUS&#8208;8 nanosheets with a film conductivity of 1.55&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. Notably, the excellent solution processability facilitates the fabrication of large&#8208;area thin films and printing of intricate patterns with good uniformity, and the Ni3(HITP)2/NUS&#8208;8&#8208;based system can monitor finger bending. Gas sensors based on Ni3(HITP)2/NUS&#8208;8 exhibit high sensitivity (LOD~6&#8197;ppb) and selectivity towards ultratrace H2S at room temperature, attributed to the coupling between Ni3(HITP)2 and NUS&#8208;8 and the redox reaction with H2S. This approach not only unlocks the potential of stacking different MOF layers in a sequence to generate functionalities that cannot be achieved by a single MOF, but also provides novel avenues for the scalable integration of MOFs in miniaturized devices with salient sensing performance.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Hydrazide&#8208;Based Nanochannels: Efficient Water Translocation and Salt Rejection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrazide backbone&#8208;derived structures create a paired water&#8208;conveying conduit in the solid state and the lipid bilayer membrane. These channel arrangements effectively facilitate water transport across the bilayer membrane while preventing the passage of protons and salts.







Abstract
Nature has ingeniously developed specialized water transporters that effectively reject ions, including protons, while transporting water across membranes. These natural water channels, known as aquaporins (AQPs), have inspired the creation of Artificial Water Channels (AWCs). However, replicating superfast water transport with synthetic molecular structures that exclude salts and protons is a challenging task. This endeavor demands the coexistence of a suitable water&#8208;binding site and a selective filter for precise water transportation. Here, we present small&#8208;molecule hydrazides 1&#8201;b&#8211;1&#8201;d that self&#8208;assemble into a rosette&#8208;type nanochannel assembly through intermolecular hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions, and selectively transport water molecules across lipid bilayer membranes. The experimental analysis demonstrates notable permeability rates for the 1&#8201;c derivative, enabling approximately 3.18&#215;108 water molecules to traverse the channel per second. This permeability rate is about one order of magnitude lower than that of AQPs. Of particular significance, the 1&#8201;c ensures exclusive passage of water molecules while effectively blocking salts and protons. MD simulation studies confirmed the stability and water transport properties of the water channel assembly inside the bilayer membranes at ambient conditions.

         <title>Unlocking of Hidden Mesopores for Enzyme Encapsulation by Dynamic Linkers in Stable Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing dynamic boroxine linkers into mesoporous PCN&#8208;333 creates defects that expand pore sizes, enabling the encapsulation of enzymes larger than the inherent pore size of MOFs. This strategy allows the immobilization of glycoenzymes in MOFs for synthesizing complex oligosaccharides and polysaccharides, demonstrating high activity and enhanced enzyme stability.







Abstract
Mesoporous metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising supports for the immobilization of enzymes, yet their applications are often limited by small pore apertures that constrain the size of encapsulated enzymes to below 5&#8197;nm. In this study, we introduced labile linkers (4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;boroxintriyl)&#8208;tribenzoate, TBTB) with dynamic boroxine bonds into mesoporous PCN&#8208;333, resulting in PCN&#8208;333&#8208;TBTB with enhanced enzyme loading and protection capabilities. The selective breaking of B&#8722;O bonds creates defects in PCN&#8208;333, which effectively expands both window and cavity sizes, thereby unlocking hidden mesopores for enzyme encapsulation. Consequently, this strategy not only increases the adsorption kinetics of small enzymes (&lt;5&#8197;nm) such as cytochrome c (Cyt C) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP), but also enables the immobilization of various large&#8208;sized enzymes (&gt;5&#8197;nm), such as glycoenzymes. The glycoenzymes@PCN&#8208;333&#8208;TBTB platform was successfully applied to synthesize thirteen complex oligosaccharides and polysaccharides, demonstrating high activity and enhanced enzyme stability. The dynamic linker&#8208;mediated enzyme encapsulation strategy enables the immobilization of enzymes exceeding the inherent pore size of MOFs, thus broadening the scope of enzymatic catalytic reactions achievable with MOF materials.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Biocatalytic Conversion of Chemically Inert Hydrocarbons into Chiral Amino Acids through Internal Cofactor and H2O2 Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;enzyme cascade conversion system was developed using O2 as the oxidant and ammonium as the amination reagent. This system is based on internal cofactor and H2O2 recycling. It is designed to facilitate the one&#8208;pot enzymatic conversion from chemically inert hydrocarbons to chiral amino acids under environmentally friendly conditions, which is a highly challenging transformation in traditional organic synthesis.







Abstract
Chemically inert hydrocarbons are the primary feedstocks used in the petrochemical industry and can be converted into more intricate and valuable chemicals. However, two major challenges impede this conversion process: selective activation of C&#8722;H bonds in hydrocarbons and systematic functionalization required to synthesize complex structures. To address these issues, we developed a multi&#8208;enzyme cascade conversion system based on internal cofactor and H2O2 recycling to achieve the one&#8208;pot deep conversion from heptane to chiral (S)&#8208;2&#8208;aminoheptanoic acid under mild conditions. First, a hydrogen&#8208;borrowing&#8208;cycle&#8208;based NADH regeneration method and H2O2 in&#8197;situ generation and consumption strategy were applied to realize selective C&#8722;H bond oxyfunctionalization, converting heptane into 2&#8208;hydroxyheptanoic acid. Integrating subsequent reductive amination driven by the second hydrogen&#8208;borrowing cycle, (S)&#8208;2&#8208;aminoheptanoic acid was finally accumulated at 4.57&#8197;mM with eep&gt;99&#8201;%. Hexane, octane, 2&#8208;methylheptane, and butylbenzene were also successfully converted into the corresponding chiral amino acids with eep&gt;99&#8201;%. Overall, the conversion system employed internal cofactor and H2O2 recycling, with O2 as the oxidant and ammonium as the amination reagent to fulfill the enzymatic conversion from chemically inert hydrocarbons into chiral amino acids under environmentally friendly conditions, which is a highly challenging transformation in traditional organic synthesis.

         <title>Unveiling the Aggregation of M&#8722;N&#8722;C Single Atoms into Highly Efficient MOOH Nanoclusters during Alkaline Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The activation and aggregation of M&#8722;N&#8722;C (M=Ni, Fe, and Co) single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are demonstrated. In this process, both N and supported carbon are severely oxidized, leading to the destruction of M&#8722;N bonds. Through a dissolution&#8208;redeposition mechanism, the isolated M atoms finally aggregate to form MOOH nanoclusters. MOOH nanoclusters with a carbon support are responsible for the enhanced OER activity.







Abstract
M&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8208;type single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are highly efficient for the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). And the isolated metal atoms are usually considered real active sites. However, the oxidative structural evolution of coordinated N during the OER will probably damage the structure of M&#8722;N&#8722;C, hence resulting in a completely different reaction mechanism. Here, we reveal the aggregation of M&#8722;N&#8722;C materials during the alkaline OER. Taking Ni&#8722;N&#8722;C as an example, multiple characterizations show that the coordinated N on the surface of Ni&#8722;N&#8722;C is almost completely dissolved in the form of NO3&#8722;, accompanied by the generation of abundant O functional groups on the surface of the carbon support. Accordingly, the Ni&#8722;N bonds are broken. Through a dissolution&#8208;redeposition mechanism and further oxidation, the isolated Ni atoms are finally converted to NiOOH nanoclusters supported by carbon as the real active sites for the enhanced OER. Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C and Co&#8722;N&#8722;C also have similar aggregation mechanism. Our findings provide unique insight into the structural evolution and activity origin of M&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8208;based catalysts under electrooxidative conditions.

&lt;p&gt;The activation and aggregation of M&#8722;N&#8722;C (M=Ni, Fe, and Co) single-atom electrocatalysts during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are demonstrated. In this process, both N and supported carbon are severely oxidized, leading to the destruction of M&#8722;N bonds. Through a dissolution-redeposition mechanism, the isolated M atoms finally aggregate to form MOOH nanoclusters. MOOH nanoclusters with a carbon support are responsible for the enhanced OER activity.

         <title>Unusual Cross&#8208;Conjugation in Cyclic Dipeptide&#8208;Based Building Blocks for Donor&#8211;Acceptor Semiconducting Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cross conjugation is typically less effective for electron delocalization and thus rarely used in semiconducting polymers. We developed TIDP, a novel building block featuring a cyclic dipeptide with backbone cross conjugation. TIDP showed a rigid, coplanar conformation with well&#8208;delocalized &#960; electrons. Polymers incorporating TIDP exhibit high charge carrier mobilities, demonstrating its effectiveness in high&#8208;performance conjugated polymers.







Abstract
Cross conjugation, though prevalent in many organic compounds, is typically considered less effective for electron delocalization compared to linear conjugation. Consequently, it is rarely used as the backbone structure for semiconducting conjugated polymers. In this study, we designed and synthesized a novel building block, TIDP, which features a central cyclic dipeptide with cross conjugation characteristics. Strong intramolecular hydrogen bonding interactions confer TIDP with a highly rigid and coplanar conformation. Importantly, theoretical calculations reveal that &#960; electrons are well delocalized across the entire structure, despite its low aromaticity. Conjugated polymers incorporating TIDP exhibit high charge carrier mobilities, demonstrating the effective &#960; electrons delocalization of this innovative building block. Our findings show that with rational design, cross conjugation can achieve effective &#960; electrons delocalization, providing a valuable approach for developing high&#8208;performance conjugated polymers for organic electronic materials.

         <title>Long&#8208;term Durability of Seawater Electrolysis for Hydrogen: From Catalysts to Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;term durability of direct electrochemical seawater splitting for H2 remains a critical issue for its industrialization. This review provides a mechanistic overview of catalysts/interfaces for durable seawater electrolysis. The development of seawater electrolysis, challenges, rational strategies and synthesis methods for durable electrocatalysts/electrodes/interfaces in seawater, and innovations in design of electrolyzers are discussed.







Abstract
Direct electrochemical seawater splitting is a renewable, scalable, and potentially economic approach for green hydrogen production in environments where ultra&#8208;pure water is not readily available. However, issues related to low durability caused by complex ions in seawater pose great challenges for its industrialization. In this review, a mechanistic analysis of durability issues of electrolytic seawater splitting is discussed. We critically analyze the development of seawater electrolysis and identify the durability challenges at both the anode and cathode. Particular emphasis is given to elucidating rational strategies for designing electrocatalysts/electrodes/interfaces with long lifetimes in realistic seawater including inducing passivating anion layers, preferential OH&#8722;adsorption, employing anti&#8208;corrosion materials, fabricating protective layers, immobilizing Cl&#8722; on the surface of electrocatalysts, tailoring Cl&#8722; adsorption sites, inhibition of OH&#8722; binding to Mg2+ and Ca2+, inhibition of Mg and Ca hydroxide precipitation adherence, and co&#8208;electrosynthesis of nano&#8208;sized Mg hydroxides. Synthesis methods of electrocatalysts/electrodes and innovations in electrolyzer are also discussed. Furthermore, the prospects for developing seawater splitting technologies for clean hydrogen generation are summarized. We found that researchers have rethought the role of Cl&#8722; ions, as well as more attention to cathodic reaction and electrolyzers, which is conducive to accelerate the commercialization of seawater electrolysis.

         <title>Versatile Light&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Degradable Bottlebrush Polymers Using &#945;&#8208;Lipoic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;step approach to bottlebrush synthesis using &#945;&#8208;lipoic acid (LA) enables control over side&#8208;chain chemistry and catalyst&#8208;free synthesis of degradable bottlebrush polymers.







Abstract
Bottlebrush polymers have a variety of useful properties including a high entanglement molecular weight, low Young's modulus, and rapid kinetics for self&#8208;assembly. However, the translation of bottlebrushes to real&#8208;world applications is limited by complex, multi&#8208;step synthetic pathways and polymerization reactions that rely on air&#8208;sensitive catalysts. Additionally, most bottlebrushes are non&#8208;degradable. Herein, we report an inexpensive, versatile, and simple approach to synthesize degradable bottlebrush polymers under mild reaction conditions. Our approach relies on the &#8220;grafting&#8208;through&#8221; polymerization of &#945;&#8208;lipoic acid (LA)&#8208;functionalized macromonomers. These macromonomers can be polymerized under mild, catalyst&#8208;free conditions, and due to reversibility of the disulfide bond in LA, the resulting bottlebrush polymers can be depolymerized by cleaving disulfide backbone bonds. Bottlebrushes with various side&#8208;chain chemistries can be prepared through the atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of LA&#8208;functionalized macromonomers, and the backbone length is governed by the macromonomer molecular weight and solvent polarity. We also demonstrate that LA&#8208;functionalized macromonomers can be copolymerized with acrylates to form degradable bottlebrush networks. This work demonstrates the preparation of degradable bottlebrush polymers with a variety of side&#8208;chain chemistries and provides insight into the light&#8208;mediated grafting&#8208;through polymerization of dithiolane&#8208;functionalized macromonomers.

         <title>dGAE(297&#8211;391) Tau Fragment Promotes Formation of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy&#8208;Like Tau Filaments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In vitro methods for obtaining disease&#8208;specific filamentous aggregates of the microtubule&#8208;associated protein tau are needed for diagnostics and drug development against tauopathies. We show that the chronic traumatic encephalopathy type II fold can be propagated onto full&#8208;length tau by seeding the aggregation with the tau fragment dGAE. The work brings us closer to in vitro preparation of disease&#8208;specific tau filament types.







Abstract
The microtubule&#8208;associated protein tau forms disease&#8208;specific filamentous aggregates in several different neurodegenerative diseases. In order to understand how tau undergoes misfolding into a specific filament type and to control this process for drug development purposes, it is crucial to study in vitro tau aggregation methods and investigate the structures of the obtained filaments at the atomic level. Here, we used the tau fragment dGAE, which aggregates spontaneously, to seed the formation of full&#8208;length tau filaments. The structures of dGAE and full&#8208;length tau filaments were investigated by magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) solid&#8208;state NMR, showing that dGAE allows propagation of a chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)&#8208;like fold to the full&#8208;length tau. The obtained filaments efficiently seeded tau aggregation in HEK293T cells. This work demonstrates that in vitro preparation of disease&#8208;specific types of full&#8208;length tau filaments is feasible.

Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Branched chiral amines with contiguous stereocenters are valuable building blocks for preparing various biologically active molecules. However, their asymmetric synthesis remains challenging. Herein, we report a highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective biocatalytic approach for preparing a broad range of &#946;&#8208;branched chiral amines starting from their corresponding racemic ketones. This involves a dynamic kinetic resolution&#8208;asymmetric reductive amination process catalyzed using only an imine reductase. Four rounds of protein engineering endowed wild&#8208;type PocIRED with higher reactivity, better stereoselectivity, and a broader substrate scope. Using the engineered enzyme, various chiral amine products were synthesized with up to &gt;99.9&#8201;%&#8197;ee, &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr, and &gt;99&#8201;% conversion. The practicability of the developed biocatalytic method was confirmed by producing a key intermediate of tofacitinib in 74&#8201;% yield, &gt;99.9&#8201;%&#8197;ee, and 98&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;dr at a challenging substrate loading of 110&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1. Our study provides a highly capable imine reductase and a protocol for developing an efficient biocatalytic dynamic kinetic resolution&#8208;asymmetric reductive amination reaction system.

         <title>Hydrazine&#8208;Catalysed Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization Of Cyclobutenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient metal&#8208;free ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization of cyclobutenes using hydrazine catalysis is described. The polymerizations proceed with high stereoselectivity and show living characteristics, achieving excellent control over molecular weight, and low dispersity values.







Abstract
Materials formed by the ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of cyclic olefins are highly valued for industrial and academic applications but are difficult to prepare free of metal contaminants. Here we describe a highly efficient metal&#8208;free ROMP of cyclobutenes using hydrazine catalysis. Reactions can be initiated via in situ condensation of a [2.2.2]&#8208;bicyclic hydrazine catalyst with an aliphatic or aromatic aldehyde initiator. The polymerizations show living characteristics, achieving excellent control over molecular weight, low dispersity values, and high chain&#8208;end fidelity. Additionally, the hydrazine can be used in substoichiometric amounts relative to the aldehyde chain&#8208;end while maintaining good control over molecular weight and low dispersity values, indicating that a highly efficient chain transfer mechanism is occurring.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Engineering&#8208;Assisted Ligand Exchange Strategy for High&#8208;Efficiency AgBiS2 Quantum Dot Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface chemistry of colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) plays a critical role in CQD solar cells. Here, a solvent engineering strategy is proposed to optimize the solid&#8208;state ligand exchange process. This strategy enables improved AgBiS2 CQD films, leading to solar cells with power conversion efficiency of 25&#8201;% higher than that of the control one, as well as enhanced stability.







Abstract
As the initial synthesized colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are generally capped with insulating ligands, ligand exchange strategies are essential in the fabrication of CQD films for solar cells, which can regulate the surface chemical states of CQDs to make them more suitable for thin&#8208;film optoelectronic devices. However, uncontrollable surface adsorption of water molecules during the ligand exchange process introduces new defect sites, thereby impairing the resultant device performance, which attracts more efforts devoted to it but remains a puzzle. Here, we develop a solvent&#8208;engineering&#8208;assisted ligand exchange strategy to revamp the surface adsorption, improve the exchange efficiency, and modulate the surface chemistry for the environmentally friendly lead&#8208;free silver bismuth disulfide (AgBiS2) CQDs. The optimized AgBiS2 CQD solar cells deliver an outstanding champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 8.95&#8201;% and improved long&#8208;term stability. Our strategy is less environment&#8208;dependent and can produce solar cells with negligible performance variance for several batches across several months. Our work demonstrates the critical role of solvents for ligand exchange in the surface chemistry of CQDs and the realization of high&#8208;performance photovoltaic devices in a highly reproducible manner.

         <title>Revitalizing Dead Zinc with Ferrocene/Ferrocenium Redox Chemistry for Deep&#8208;Cycle Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dissolve oxygen&#8208;initiated revitalization strategy is proposed to reactivate dead Zn via ferrocene redox chemistry, which differs from the widely concerned dendrite suppression strategies. Ferrocene scaffold can be spontaneously oxidized to ferricenium cations by dissolved oxygen and the generated ferricenium cations can rejuvenate electrically isolated dead Zn into electroactive Zn2+ ions to compensate the zinc loss.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc (Zn) batteries are highly desirable for sustainable and large&#8208;scale electrochemical energy storage technologies. However, the ceaseless dendrite growth and the derived dead Zn are principally responsible for the capacity decay and insufficient lifespan. Here, we propose a dissolved oxygen&#8208;initiated revitalization strategy to reactivate dead Zn via ferrocene redox chemistry, which can be realized by incorporating a trace amount of poly(ethylene glycol) as a solubilizer to improve the solubility of water&#8208;insoluble ferrocene derivatives. Ferrocene scaffold can be spontaneously oxidized to ferricenium cations by dissolved oxygen, which eradicates the dissolved oxygen&#8208;involved Zn corrosion and insulating by&#8208;product generation. Subsequently, the generated ferricenium cations as the scavenger can rejuvenate electrically isolated dead Zn into electroactive Zn2+ ions to compensate the zinc loss. Through this design, the symmetric cell exhibited improved cycle life of 3700&#8197;h at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and 220&#8197;h under a high depth of discharge of 80&#8201;%. Importantly, the Zn||NaV3O8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1.5H2O full cells demonstrated the impressive cycling stability over 1500&#8197;cycles at a low N/P ratio of 3.0. This work presents an innovative solution for the revitalization of dead Zn to extend the lifespan of deep&#8208;cycling metal batteries.

         <title>A Thermally Populated Germylene&#8208;Based Donor&#8208;Acceptor Diradical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A germylene&#8208;based D&#8722;A molecule was synthesized by radical head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dimerization under mild conditions. The coordination of Lewis acids led to intramolecular single electron transfer upon heating to form a thermally populated triplet diradical. This work provided an approach to the formation of thermally populated open&#8208;shell species in main group chemistry.







Abstract
This work reports synthesis of a germylene based donor&#8208;acceptor molecule and its thermal excitation to a triplet state by coordination with a Lewis acid. Products have been characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, EPR spectroscopy, and SQUID measurement, in conjunction with DFT calculation. The singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap of the donor&#8208;acceptor molecule is dramatically reduced from &#8722;18.8 to &#8722;7.2&#8197;kcal/mol by the coordination with B(C6F5)3 (BCF), which enables an intramolecular single electron transfer from one germylene moiety to another upon heating, forming an intramolecular radical ion pair with diradical character. The work provides an approach to the formation of thermally populated open&#8208;shell species of heavier main group elements.

The singlet-triplet energy gap of the donor-acceptor molecule is dramatically reduced from &#8722;18.8 to &#8722;7.2&#8197;kcal/mol by the coordination with B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (BCF), which enables an intramolecular single electron transfer from one germylene moiety to another upon heating, forming an intramolecular radical ion pair with diradical character. The work provides an approach to the formation of thermally populated open-shell species of heavier main group elements.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dye induced luminescence properties of gold(I) complexes with near unity quantum efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Improving the glow of gold complexes. Herein, we report a facile synthetic strategy to introduce a dye, namely, 7&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;methylcoumarin, as a ligand to access luminescent gold complexes of different nuclearity. Introduction of the dye enables the isolation of gold complexes with rich photophysical properties such as high emission quantum yields.







Abstract
To study the effect of a dye on the photoluminescence (PL) properties of metal complexes, a series of gold(I) complexes were synthesized, containing a 7&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;methylcoumarin luminophore. The complexes are comprised of a coumarin moiety featuring different ancillary ligands, specifically N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes, triphenylphosphine, and diphenyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridylphosphine. The synthesized gold(I) complexes are luminescent both in solution and the solid state at room temperature and 77&#8197;K. Complexes of different nuclearity, i.e., mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and trinuclear compounds were synthesized. A clear trend between the nuclearity and the quantum yields can be seen. The coumarin dye not only improves the PL properties, but also enhances the luminescence of trinuclear clusters, which are otherwise known to be weak emitters in solution. The optical absorption properties were investigated in detail by quantum chemical calculations.

         <title>Enhancing Hole Transport Uniformity for Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells through Optimizing Buried Interface Contacts and Suppressing Interface Recombination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
P&#8208;xylylenediphosphonic acid (p&#8208;XPA) was introduced between the hole transport layer (HTL) and the perovskite film. P&#8208;XPA made the HTL planar, promoted perovskite crystallization, and effectively passivated the bottom defects of the perovskite film. Ultimately, the device power conversion efficiency reached 25.87&#8201;% and the stability was significantly improved.







Abstract
[4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9yl)butyl]phosphonic acid (Me&#8208;4PACz) self&#8208;assembly material has been recognized as a highly effective approach for mitigating nickel oxide (NiOx) surface&#8208;related challenges in inverted perovskite solar cells (IPSCs). However, its uneven film generation and failure to effectively passivate the buried interface defects limit the device&#8216;s performance improvement potential. Herein, p&#8208;xylylenediphosphonic acid (p&#8208;XPA) containing bilateral phosphate groups (&#8722;PO3H2) is introduced as an interface layer between the NiOx/Me&#8208;4PACz and the perovskite layer. P&#8208;XPA can flatten the surface of hole transport layer and optimize interface contact. Meanwhile, p&#8208;XPA achieves better energy level alignment and promotes interfacial hole transport. In addition, the bilateral &#8722;PO3H2 of p&#8208;XPA can chelate with Pb2+ and form hydrogen bond with FA+ (formamidinium cation), thereby suppressing buried interface non&#8208;radiative recombination loss. Consequently, the IPSC with p&#8208;XPA buried interface modification achieves champion power conversion efficiency of 25.87&#8201;% (certified at 25.45&#8201;%) at laboratory scale (0.0448&#8197;cm2). The encapsulated target device exhibits better operational stability. Even after 1100&#8197;hours of maximum power point tracking at 50&#8201;&#176;C, its efficiency remains at an impressive 82.7&#8201;% of the initial efficiency. Molecules featuring bilateral passivation groups optimize interfacial contact and inhibit interfacial recombination, providing an effective approach to enhancing the stability and efficiency of devices.

         <title>Enhancement of Lithium&#8208;Mediated Nitrogen Reduction by Modifying Center Atom of Tetraalkyl&#8208;Type Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alcoholic proton carriers in lithium mediated nitrogen reduction were replaced with ionic liquids (ILs). Switching the central atom in these ILs notably boosted performance, increasing Faradaic efficiency (FE) by 1.45&#8197;times when switching from phosphonium to ammonium cations with an FE of 39.5&#8201;% and remained stable for over 12&#8197;h.







Abstract
The lithium&#8208;mediated nitrogen reduction reaction (Li&#8208;NRR) offers a viable alternative to the Haber&#8211;Bosch process for ammonia production. However, ethanol, a common proton carrier in Li&#8208;NRR, exhibits electrochemical instability, leading to oxidation at the anode or byproduct formation at the cathode. This study replaces alcoholic proton carriers with ionic liquids (ILs), specifically tetrabutylphosphonium chloride (TBPCl) and tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBACl), to examine how the electronegativity differences between the central atom and adjacent carbon of the cation affect catalytic performance. The results show that switching the central atom in tetraalkyl&#8208;type ILs markedly enhances performance, specifically resulting in a 1.45&#8208;fold increase in Faradaic efficiency (FE) with the transition from phosphonium to ammonium cation of ILs. Additionally, optimal IL concentrations in the electrolyte are identified to maximize ammonia yield. TBACl, in particular, demonstrates enhanced ammonia production and operational stability, achieving an ammonia yield rate of 13.60&#8197;nmol/cm2/s, an FE of 39.5&#8201;%, and operational stability for over 12&#8197;h under conditions of 10&#8197;mA/cm2 and 10&#8197;atm. This research underscores the potential of precise IL modifications for more efficient and sustainable Li&#8208;NRR.

Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1 achieved months&#8208;long autotrophic growth and acetate production through CO2 fixation coupled to sulfur oxidation, driven by biogenic CdS nanoparticles under light.







Abstract
Members of the genus Shewanella are known for their versatile electron accepting routes, which allow them to couple decomposition of organic matter to reduction of various terminal electron acceptors for heterotrophic growth in diverse environments. Here, we report autotrophic growth of Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1 with photoelectrons provided by illuminated biogenic CdS nanoparticles. This hybrid system enables photosynthetic oscillatory acetate production from CO2 for over five months, far exceeding other inorganic&#8208;biological hybrid system that can only sustain for hours or days. Biochemical, electrochemical and transcriptomic analyses reveal that the efficient electron uptake of S. oneidensis MR&#8208;1 from illuminated CdS nanoparticles supplies sufficient energy to stimulate the previously overlooked reductive glycine pathway for CO2 fixation. The continuous solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion is achieved by photon induced electric recycling in sulfur species. Overall, our findings demonstrate that this mineral&#8208;assisted photosynthesis, as a widely existing and unique model of light energy conversion, could support the sustained photoautotrophic growth of non&#8208;photosynthetic microorganisms in nutrient&#8208;lean environments and mediate the reversal of coupled carbon and sulfur cycling, consequently resulting in previously unknown environmental effects. In addition, the hybrid system provides a sustainable and flexible platform to develop a variety of solar products for carbon neutrality.

         <title>A Strategy for the Formal C&#8722;N Cross&#8208;Coupling of Tertiary Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a strategy for the formal C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling of tertiary amines via the in situ generation and displacement of N&#8208;acyl ammonium species. Specifically, treatment of acyclic and cyclic tertiary amines with TFAA or chloroformates in the presence of NaI leads to the generation of alkyl iodides, which can be engaged directly in Ni&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings.

Abstract
We report a strategy for the formal C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling of tertiary amines via the in situ generation and displacement of N&#8208;acyl ammonium species. Specifically, treatment of diverse tertiary amines with TFAA or chloroformates in the presence of NaI leads to the efficient generation of alkyl iodides, which can be engaged directly in Ni&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings. The protocol is applicable to acyclic and cyclic systems, including highly hindered variants. Applications to the late&#8208;stage modification of complex heterocycles are presented.

         <title>Nacre&#8208;Inspired Structure Enables Ultrahigh &#8216;Strong&#8208;Tough&#8217; Design of Phosphorus Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The critical cracking thickness of alloy&#8208;type anodes is typically suboptimal due to the inverse relationship between mass loading and intrinsic toughness. This issue is addressed by the development of a nacre&#8208;like structure, which contributes fast ionic/electronic migration and ultrahigh &#8216;strength&#8208;toughness&#8217;. Such structure design contributes to the enhancement of mass loading and long&#8208;life cycle stability of alloy&#8208;type anodes with high specific capacity.







Abstract
Red phosphorus anode, attributed to its high specific capacity of 2596&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, is expected to improve the energy density of Na&#8208;ion batteries. However, the P anode currently is unsatisfactory for practical usage due to the large volume expansion beyond 300&#8201;%, which brings out uncontrolled brittle failure. To address this challenge, we here design a nacre&#8208;like phosphorus anode by resilient graphene oxide staggered together. The staggered structure simultaneously offers mechanical strength and interwoven toughness. Finite element modeling reveals that the sodiation stress from P nanoparticles will be transferred into interlayer pillars as the elastic medium to release sodiation stress. The prepared anode achieves an ultrahigh areal capacity of 13&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a mass loading of 5.8&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Notably, the volume change of the anode is limited to approximately 8.1&#8201;% at full sodiation, significantly lower than that of the traditional phosphorus electrodes.

         <title>Cleavage of Homonuclear Chalcogen&#8208;Chalcogen Bonds in a Hybrid Platform in Response to X&#8208;Ray Radiation Potentiates Tumor Radiochemotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The site&#8208;directed generation of chalcogens (S, Se, Te) in response to external ionizing radiation to enable drug decaging in target lesions remains a huge challenge. Hybrid monodisperse organosilicon nanoprodrugs containing homonuclear chalcogen&#8211;chalcogen single bonds have now been developed as a versatile X&#8208;ray&#8208;ultraresponsive nanoplatform for tumor radiochemotherapy.







Abstract
Chalcogens are used as sensitive redox&#8208;responsive reagents in tumor therapy. However, chalcogen bonds triggered by external ionizing radiation, rather than by internal environmental stimuli, enable site&#8208;directed and real&#8208;time drug degradation in target lesions. This approach helps to bypass chemoresistance and global systemic toxicity, presenting a significant advancement over traditional chemoradiotherapy. In this study, we fabricated a hybrid monodisperse organosilica nanoprodrug based on homonuclear single bonds (disulfide bonds (S&#8722;S, approximately 240&#8197;kJ/mol), diselenium bonds (Se&#8722;Se, approximately 172&#8197;kJ/mol), and tellurium bonds (Te&#8722;Te, 126&#8197;kJ/mol)), including ditelluride&#8208;bond&#8208;bridged MONs (DTeMSNs), diselenide&#8208;bond&#8208;bridged MONs (DSeMSNs) and disulfide&#8208;bond&#8208;bridged MONs (DSMSNs). The results demonstrated that differences in electronegativities and atomic radii influenced their oxidation sensitivities and reactivities. Tellurium, with the lowest electronegativity, showed the highest sensitivity, followed by selenium and sulfur. DTeMSNs exhibited highly responsive cleavage upon exposure to X&#8208;rays, resulting in oxidation to TeO32&#8722;. Furthermore, chalcogen&#8208;hybridized organosilica was loaded with manganese ions (Mn2+) to enhance the release of Mn2+ during radiotherapy, thereby activating the the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway and enhancing the tumor immune response to inhibit tumor growth. This investigation of hybrid organosilica deepens our understanding of chalcogens response characteristics to radiotherapy and enriches the design principles for nanomedicine based on prodrugs.

         <title>Nanoporous Heterojunction Photocatalysts with Engineered Interfacial Sites for Efficient Photocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoporous and chemically bonded S&#8208;Scheme heterojunction photocatalyst is synthesized by hybridization of two semiconducting MOFs, which exhibits excellent performance of photocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction with an NH3 production rate of 2.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, an apparent quantum yield value of 16.2&#8201;% at 365&#8197;nm and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 0.28&#8201;%.







Abstract
Photocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (PNRR) offers a promising strategy for sustainable production of ammonia (NH3). However, the reported photocatalysts suffer from low efficiency with great room to improve regarding the charge carrier utilization and active site engineering. Herein, a porous and chemically bonded heterojunction photocatalyst is developed for efficient PNRR to NH3 production via hybridization of two semiconducting metal&#8212;organic frameworks (MOFs), MIL&#8208;125&#8722;NH2 (MIL=Material Institute Lavoisier) and Co&#8208;HHTP (HHTP=2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytripehenylene). Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate the formation of Ti&#8722;O&#8722;Co chemical bonds at the interface, which not only serve as atomic pathway for S&#8208;scheme charge transfer, but also provide electron&#8208;deficient Co centers for improving N2 chemisorption/activation capability and restricting competitive hydrogen evolution. Moreover, the nanoporous structure allows the transportation of reactants to the interfacial active sites at heterojunction, enabling the efficient utilization of charge carriers. Consequently, the rationally designed MOF&#8208;based heterojunction exhibits remarkable PNRR performance with an NH3 production rate of 2.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, an apparent quantum yield (AQY) value of 16.2&#8201;% at 365&#8197;nm and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) efficiency of 0.28&#8201;%, superior to most reported PNRR photocatalysts. Our work provides new insights into the design principles of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts.

         <title>Homochiral Covalent Organic Frameworks with Superhelical Nanostructures Enable Efficient Chirality&#8208;Induced Spin Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homochiral superhelical COF nanofibers were synthesized by manipulating the lengths of alkyl chains in enantiopure BINOL&#8208;based organic linkers. The resulting 3D chiral COFs formed right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed superhelix fibers with macroscopic chirality. These nanofibers exhibit significantly enhanced enantiodiscrimination in carbohydrate binding and a remarkable chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect.







Abstract
Despite significant advancements in fabricating covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with diverse morphologies, creating COFs with superhelical nanostructures remains challenging. We report here the controlled synthesis of homochiral superhelical COF nanofibers by manipulating pendent alkyl chain lengths in organic linkers. This approach yields homochiral 3D COFs 13&#8208;OR with a 10&#8208;fold interpenetrated diamondoid structure (R=H, Me, Et, nPr, nBu) from enantiopure 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL)&#8208;based tetraaldehydes and tetraamine. COF&#8208;13&#8208;OEt exhibits macroscopic chirality as right&#8208;handed and left&#8208;handed superhelical fibers, whereas others adopt spherical or non&#8208;helical morphologies. Time&#8208;tracking shows a self&#8208;assembly process from non&#8208;helical strands to single&#8208;stranded helical fibers and intertwined superhelices. Ethoxyl substituents, being of optimal size, balance solvophobic effects and intermolecular interactions, driving the formation of superhelical nanostructures, with handedness determined by BINOL chirality. The superhelical nature of these materials is evident in their chiral recognition and spin&#8208;filter properties, showing significantly improved enantiodiscrimination in carbohydrate binding (up to six times higher enantioselectivity) and a remarkable chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect with a 48&#8211;51&#8201;% spin polarization ratio, a feature absent in non&#8208;helical analogs.

This approach yields homochiral 3D COFs &lt;b&gt;13-OR&lt;/b&gt; with a 10-fold interpenetrated diamondoid structure (R=H, Me, Et, &lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;

   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Bu) from enantiopure 1,1&#8242;-bi-2-naphthol (BINOL)-based tetraaldehydes and tetraamine. &lt;b&gt;COF-13-OEt&lt;/b&gt; exhibits macroscopic chirality as right-handed and left-handed superhelical fibers, whereas others adopt spherical or non-helical morphologies. Time-tracking shows a self-assembly process from non-helical strands to single-stranded helical fibers and intertwined superhelices. Ethoxyl substituents, being of optimal size, balance solvophobic effects and intermolecular interactions, driving the formation of superhelical nanostructures, with handedness determined by BINOL chirality. The superhelical nature of these materials is evident in their chiral recognition and spin-filter properties, showing significantly improved enantiodiscrimination in carbohydrate binding (up to six times higher enantioselectivity) and a remarkable chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect with a 48&#8211;51&#8201;% spin polarization ratio, a feature absent in non-helical analogs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intermolecular Anionic Mixed&#8208;Valence and &#960;&#8208;Dimer Complexes of ortho&#8208;Pentannulated Bisazacoronene Diimide</title>

         <dc:description>
The electrochemical reduction of ortho&#8208;pentannulated bisazacoronene diimides in a non&#8208;aqueous solvent has led to the serendipitous discovery of intermolecular anionic mixed&#8208;valence and &#960;&#8208;dimer species. The observation of this phenomenon provides insights into the fundamental behaviour of supramolecular organic semiconductors, thereby paving the way for the development of novel electronic devices and electron&#8208;deficient materials.







Abstract
This study reports the serendipitous discovery of intermolecular anionic mixed&#8208;valence (MV) and &#960;&#8208;dimer species in ortho&#8208;pentannulated BisAzaCoroneneDiimides (BACDs) during their electrochemical reduction in a non&#8208;aqueous solvent. A library of nitrogen&#8208;containing extended PDIs was synthesized via an aza&#8208;benzannulation reaction followed by a Pd&#8208;catalysed ortho&#8208;pentannulation reaction. Ortho&#8208;pentannulated BACDs revealed strong aggregation abilities in solution. Concentration&#8208;dependent UV/Vis absorption spectra, variable temperature 1H NMR experiments, and atomic force microscopy coupled to molecular dynamics support their self&#8208;assembly into columnar aggregates. Cyclic voltammetry experiments in dichloromethane reveal prominent splitting of the first reduction wave, attributed to the formation of unprecedented intermolecular anionic MV and &#960;&#8208;dimers in organic solvent. These species were thoroughly characterized by real&#8208;time spectroelectrochemistry, electrochemical simulations and theoretical calculations. Remarkably, this work underscores the tuneable nature of AzaBenzannulatedPerylene Diimides (AzaBPDIs) and BACDs, emphasizing their potential as a promising scaffold for designing supramolecular materials with long&#8208;range radical anion delocalization. The observation of this phenomenon provides insights into the fundamental behaviour of supramolecular organic semiconductors, thereby paving the way for the development of novel electronic devices and electron&#8208;deficient materials.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;doped Carbon Nitrides with Visible Room&#8208;temperature Phosphorescence and Invisible Thermal&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Ultraviolet Delayed Fluorescence for Security Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emergence of efficient solid&#8208;state fluorescence, visible room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and thermal&#8208;stimuli&#8208;production invisible ultraviolet (UV) delayed fluorescence (DF) is discovered by introducing oxygen relevant groups into carbon nitrides. The prepared materials exhibit great potentials in security protections by means of the thermal&#8208;stimuli quenching visible RTP and meanwhile producing invisible UV DF with superior concealment.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;mode emissive materials with stimuli&#8208;responsive producing invisible signals are very attractive for advanced security applications, but development of such materials remains highly challenging. In this work, oxygen&#8208;doped carbon nitrides (O&#8208;CNs) are prepared via microwave&#8208;assisted heating of urea, which exhibit ultraviolet (UV) solid&#8208;state fluorescence (SSFL), visible room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and thermal&#8208;stimuli production of invisible UV delayed fluorescence (DF) properties. Further studies confirmed that the SSFL and RTP could be attributed to the introduction of oxygen functional group (e.&#8201;g., C=O) in the skeleton of O&#8208;CNs, thus minimizing the aggregation caused quenching effect, facilitating intersystem crossing, and stabilizing the excited triplet states. The specific thermal&#8208;stimuli production of UV DF is deemed to be the relatively large energy gap between ground and excited singlet states as well as an effective triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation. Notably, the emission maximum of UV DF locates at ~310&#8197;nm with an ultra&#8208;narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) down to 19&#8197;nm, so it is completely invisible to the naked eyes, but detectable by a UV camera. To employ the unique characteristics of O&#8208;CNs, security protection strategies with superior concealment by virtue of the thermal&#8208;stimuli quenching visible RTP and meanwhile producing invisible UV DF are demonstrated.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Induced Structural Rearrangement Towards a White&#8208;Light&#8208;Emitting Adamantane&#8208;Type Cluster Dimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of an ethylene bridge into a quaternary adamantane&#8208;type cluster core {Si(CH2)n(C2H4)mSn3S3} (n/m=3/0 or 2/1) causes distinct distortions, which the molecules escape by an unprecedented dimerization of the cluster cores. This structural change affects the (extreme) nonlinear optical properties of such white&#8208;light emitting materials, as shown by a combined experimental and quantum&#8208;chemical study.







Abstract
Group 14/16 adamantane&#8208;type hybrid clusters of the type [(RT)4E6] (T=group 14 element, E=group 16 element, R=organic group) have been reported to emit white&#8208;light when irradiated in an amorphous state with a continuous&#8208;wave (CW) infrared laser diode. This effect is enhanced if the cluster core is varied from a binary to a more complex composition. To further explore this phenomenon, we synthesized clusters with a multinary R/R&#8217;&#8208;T/T&#8217;&#8208;E/E&#8217; composition, including isolobal replacement of E with CH2, in [(2&#8208;NpSi){CH2Sn(S)Ph}3] (1, Np=naphthyl). When expanding one of the CH2 moieties to a C2H4 group, thus generating a R/R&#8217;&#8208;T/T&#8217;&#8208;E/E&#8217;/E&#8217;&#8217; cluster composition, we unexpectedly observed a dimerization of the initially formed, yet non&#8208;isolable adamantane&#8208;like cluster [(2&#8208;NpSi){CH2Sn(S)Ph}2{C2H4Sn(S)Ph}] (2) to [(2&#8208;NpSi){CH2Sn(S)Ph}2{C2H4Sn(S)Ph}]2 (3), exhibiting a heretofore unprecedented cluster architecture. Both monomeric 1 and dimeric 3, show white&#8208;light emission as thin films. The nonlinear optical response of the compounds was also modelled with DFT methods.

         <title>Mechanochromic Displays Based on Photoswitchable Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>

         <dc:description>
Mechanochromic intricate pictures with striking structural colors are imprinted in cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers by using a chiral isosorbide molecular photoswitch.







Abstract
Stimuli responsive optical materials are attractive for many areas, from healthcare to art design. However, creating intricate color&#8208;changing patterns for visual information is still a challenge. This work describes the preparation of mechanochromic structural colored intricate pictures imprinted in cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers by using a chiral isosorbide molecular photoswitch. The photoswitch contains a photoisomerizable cinnamate moiety and was incorporated in a main chain liquid crystal oligomer with photopolymerizable acrylate end groups. After coating, the structural colored film was irradiated with ultraviolet (UV) light in air causing E/Z isomerization of the cinnamate units leading to a redshift of the structural color of the film. A grayscale photomask was used to spatially control the photoisomerization reaction and imprint colorful pictures such as portraits and landscapes, in the cholesteric liquid crystal films with high resolution. Photopolymerization in a nitrogen atmosphere led to a mechanochromic cholesteric liquid crystal elastomer with striking structural colors that blueshift upon strain. The sharp details of the patterns were preserved even under deformation and the system returned to the initial state upon strain removal. Our work offers a simple photoswitch approach to prepare stimuli responsive optical polymers imprinted with color&#8208;changing pictures of unprecedented complexity.

Half&#8208;titanocenes (Cp&#8242;)[HCN(Ar)]2BOTiCl2 bearing bulky electron&#8208;donating N&#8208;heterocyclic boryloxy ligands enabled the controlled synthesis of poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;9&#8208;decen&#8208;1&#8208;ol) with unprecedented high polar monomer contents up to 32.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% while maintaining a high catalytic activity. The structural analysis and DFT calculations disclosed that the bulky and strong electron&#8208;donating boryloxy ligands play significant roles for the excellent catalytic performances.







Abstract
The preparation of polyolefins with high polar monomer contents (above 20&#8197;mol&#8201;%) has long been a challenge. Half&#8208;titanocenes (Cp&#8242;)[HCN(Ar)]2BOTiCl2 bearing bulky electron&#8208;donating N&#8208;heterocyclic boryloxy ligands have been designed and synthesized. The complexes (Cp*)[HCN(Ar)]2BOTiCl2 (2, Ar=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; 5, Ar=2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2) supported by Cp* and the boryloxy ligands have been shown to efficiently catalyze the copolymerization of ethylene and long chain &#945;&#8208;olefins. In particular, precatalyst 5 enabled the controlled synthesis of poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;9&#8208;decen&#8208;1&#8208;ol) with unprecedented high polar monomer contents up to 32.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% while maintaining the high catalytic activity. The structural analysis and DFT calculations disclosed that the bulky and strong electron&#8208;donating boryloxy ligands could effectively stabilize cationic active species. The mechanical studies on the hydroxyl&#8208;functionalized copolymers disclosed that they exhibited high strength and toughness because of the existence of hydrogen bonds in the polymer network.

         <title>Anomalous Pressure&#8208;Induced Blue&#8208;Shifted Emission of Ionic Copper&#8208;Iodine Clusters: The Competitive Effect between Cuprophilic Interactions and Through&#8208;Space Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The competitive effect between cuprophilic interactions and through&#8208;space interactions achieved the anomalous pressure&#8208;induced blue&#8208;shifted luminescence of ionic copper&#8208;iodide clusters, which corresponds to the triplet excitons exhibiting a luminescence dominated by 3TSCT and supplemented by 3CC.







Abstract
Developing ionic copper&#8208;iodine clusters with multiple emitting is crucial for enriching lighting and display materials with various colors. However, the luminescent properties of traditional ionic copper&#8208;iodine clusters are often closely associated with low&#8208;energy cluster&#8208;centered triplet emission, which will redshift further as the Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cu bond length decreases. This article utilizes a pressure&#8208;treated strategy to achieve an anomalous pressure&#8208;induced blue&#8208;shifted luminescence phenomenon in ionic Cu4I6(4&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;1&#8208;ethylpyridinium)2 crystals for the first time, which is based on dominant through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer (TSCT). Herein, we reveal that the more advantageous through&#8208;space interactions in the competition between cuprophilic interactions and through&#8208;space interactions can lead to a blue&#8208;shifted luminescence. High&#8208;pressure angle&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray diffraction and high&#8208;pressure infrared experiments show that the enhanced through&#8208;space interactions mainly originate from forming new intermolecular C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I hydrogen bonds and the enhancement of van der Waals interactions between organic cations and anionic clusters. Theoretical calculations and experimental studies of excited&#8208;state dynamics confirm that the blue&#8208;shifted emission is due to the increased energy gap between the excited triplet and ground states caused by the electron delocalization under stronger through&#8208;space interactions. This work deepens previous understanding and provides a new avenue to design and synthetic ionic copper&#8208;iodine clusters with high&#8208;energy TSCT emission.

         <title>Complex Dance of Molecules in the Sky: Choreography of Intermolecular Structure and Dynamics in the Cyclopentene&#8722;CO2&#8722;H2O Hetero Ternary Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of high&#8208;resolution rotational spectroscopy coupled with comprehensive theoretical calculations provides a first observation and analysis of the c&#8208;C5H8&#8722;CO2&#8722;H2O hetero ternary cluster, unveiling the subtle interplay of forces that govern its formation.







Abstract
This study delves into driving forces behind the formation of a hetero ternary cluster consisting of volatile organic compounds from industrial or combustion sources, specifically cyclopentene, alongside greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, and water vapor. While substantial progress has been made in understanding binary complexes, the structural intricacies of hetero ternary clusters remain largely uncharted. Our research characterized the cyclopentene&#8722;CO2&#8722;H2O hetero ternary cluster utilizing Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy. The observed isomer in the pulsed jet has CO2 and H2O aligning above the cyclopentene ring, with water undergoing an internal rotation approximately about its C2 symmetry axis. Theoretical analyses support these observations, identifying an O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; hydrogen bond and a secondary C&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O tetrel bond within this cluster. This study marks a critical step towards comprehending the molecular dynamics and interactions of VOCs, greenhouse gases, and water in the atmosphere, paving the way for further investigations into their roles in climate dynamics and air quality.

         <title>Regulating the Spin&#8208;State of Cobalt in Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Iodine Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although the catalytic activity is heavily reliant on the electronic structure of the catalyst, understanding the impact of electron spin regulation on electrocatalytic performance is still rarely investigated. This work presents a novel approach involving the single&#8208;atom coordination of cobalt (Co) within metalloporphyrin&#8208;based three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D&#8208;COFs) to facilitate the catalytic conversion for sodium&#8208;iodine batteries. The spin state of Co is modulated by altering the oxidation state of the porphyrin&#8208;centered Co, achieving optimal catalysis for iodine reduction. Experimental results demonstrate that CoII and CoIII are incorporated into the 3D&#8208;COFs, exhibiting spin ground states of S = 1/2 and S = 0, respectively. The low spin state of CoIII is favorable to hybridize with the sp 3d orbitals of I3&#8208;, thus facilitating the conversion of I3&#8208; to I&#8208;. Density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that the presence of CoIII enhances iodide adsorption and accelerates the formation of NaI in 3D&#8208;COFs&#8208;CoIII, thereby promoting its rapid kinetic behaviors. Notably, the I2@3D&#8208;COFs&#8208;CoIII cathode achieves a high reversible capacity of 227.7 mAh g&#8208;1 after 200 cycles at 0.5 C and demonstrates exceptional cyclic stability, exceeding 2000 cycles at 10 C with a minor capacity fading rate of less than one 0.01% per cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Palladium Migration for Synthesis of Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;Cage o&#8208;Carboranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal migration strategy can offer BH functionalization of o&#8208;carboranes at different positions from where initial bond activation occurs to achieve bifunctionalized o&#8208;carboranes in one reaction. We report in this article an enantioselective 3,4&#8208;bifunctionalization of o&#8208;carboranes via asymmetric Pd migration with a high efficiency and up to 98% ee. This asymmetric catalysis has a broad substrates scope, leading to the preparation of a class of chiral&#8208;at&#8208;cage o&#8208;carborane derivatives. The enantiocontrol model is suggested on the basis of density functional theory (DFT) results, where the chiral Trost ligand plays a crucial role in this enantioselective Pd migration from exo&#8208;alkenyl sp2 C to the cage B(4) position of o&#8208;carborane.</dc:description>

         <title>Selenium Dioxide Catalyzed Polymerization of N&#8208;doped Poly(benzodifurandione) (n&#8208;PBDF) and Its Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recent discovery of highly conductive, solution&#8208;processable, n&#8208;doped poly(benzodifurandione) (n&#8208;PBDF) marks a milestone in the development of&#160;conducting polymers. Currently, n&#8208;PBDF is prepared by either duroquinone&#8208;mediated or copper&#8208;catalyzed polymerizations, where scalability and cost&#8208;effectiveness may present challenges. Here, we report a general, scalable, and cost&#8208;effective method for n&#8208;PBDF and its derivatives, namely selenium dioxide (SeO2) catalyzed polymerization. We discovered that a catalytic amount of selenium dioxide leads to high monomer conversions (&gt;99% by NMR). The obtained n&#8208;PBDF exhibits a consistently narrow hydrodynamic diameter distribution and its thin films show high conductivities. Furthermore, we revealed that this polymerization involves a mechanism distinct from the previously reported radical pathway. It involves successive Riley oxidation and aldol polycondensation processes. It was also found that the reduced selenium precipitates from dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) when the catalytic cycle is terminated, allowing for a straightforward purification process through centrifugation and filtration. This method thus eliminates the need for the costly and slow dialysis process. Finally, we demonstrated that SeO2 catalyzed polymerization is applicable to n&#8208;PBDF derivatives, proving the generality of this method.</dc:description>

         <title>The Paradoxical Influence of Hydrothermally Treated Zeolites on the Hydrocarbon Pool Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the mechanistic intricacies of hydrothermally treated zeolite is crucial for valorizing any oxygen&#8208;containing renewable feedstocks (e.g., methanol, carbon dioxide, biomass). Additionally, the regeneration of deactivated zeolite catalysts under oxidative conditions, akin to hydrothermal treatment, is essential in industrial processes. While research in this area has predominantly focused on characterizing steaming&#8208;induced physicochemical changes in zeolite, their ultimate impact on the organic reaction mechanism governed by the hydrocarbon pool dual&#8208;cycle mechanism remains unclear. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study investigates the effect of steamed zeolite on the organic reaction mechanism during the industrially significant methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons process. We achieved this objective by strategically integrating catalytic and control experiments over the pristine and steamed zeolites and their advanced characterization, including under operando conditions, XRD structural refinement, and using &#8220;mobility&#8208;dependent&#8221; solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. This multimodal characterization approach was instrumental in elucidating elusive mechanistic information in the dual&#8208;cycle mechanism, shedding light on phenomena such as the unchanged ethylene selectivity despite decreasing aromatics selectivity, while ethylene could solely be derived from arene&#8208;based reaction intermediates. This study could improve the process efficiency in zeolite catalysis by connecting steaming&#8208;induced changes in the organic reaction mechanisms with inorganic material aspects.</dc:description>

         <title>Creating Spin Channels in SrCoO3 through Triagonal&#8208;to&#8208;Cubic Structural Transformation for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution/Reduction Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen evolution and reduction reactions (OER and ORR) play crucial roles in energy conversion processes such as water splitting and air batteries, where spin dynamics inherently influence their efficiency. However, the specific contribution of spin has yet to be fully understood. In this study, we intentionally introduce a spin channel through the transformation of trigonal antiferromagnetic SrCoO2.5 into cubic ferromagnetic SrCoO3, aiming to deepen our understanding of spin dynamics in catalytic reactions. Based on the results from spherical&#8208;aberration&#8208;corrected microscope, synchrotron absorption spectra, magnetic characterizations, and density functional theory calculations, it is revealed that surface electron transfer is predominantly governed by local geometric structures, while the presence of the spin channel significantly enhances the bulk transport of spin&#8208;polarized electrons, particularly under high current densities where surface electron transfer is no longer the limiting factor. The overpotential for OER is reduced by at least 70 mV at 150 mA cm&#8208;2 due to the enhanced conductivity from spin&#8208;polarized electrons facilitated by spin channels, with an expectation of even more significant reductions at higher current densities. This work provides a clearer picture of the role of spin in oxygen&#8208;involved electrocatalysis, providing critical insights for the design of more efficient catalytic systems in practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Active Sites of Metal/Metal Oxide Catalysts by Oxide Ligand Overlayers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineering sites of supported metal catalysts is essential to enhancing activity and selectivity. Such enhancement is typically achieved by particle size modification, surface alloying, or attaching molecular ligands. Yet, control strategies for complex, multifunctional molecules and catalysts, where selectivity is crucial, are lacking. Here, we demonstrate that submonolayer WOx with tunable coverage preferentially decorates well&#8208;coordinated Pt terrace sites as a stable ligand. By combining experimental kinetics with probe molecules, in situ spectroscopies, and first&#8208;principles modeling, we show that the WOx coverage on Pt modifies the metal&#8208;to&#8208;acid site balance while retaining the acid strength intact and results in optimal reactivity for metal&#8208;acid catalyzed reactions at a specific metal, size, and support&#8208;dependent WOx coverage. The oxide can also alter the reactant adsorption mode, reversing selectivity and pathways from terrace&#8208; to step&#8208;dominated, as evidenced in furfural decarbonylation and hydrogenation. The insights open avenues for improving metal/metal oxide catalysts beyond the specific system.</dc:description>

         <title>A Strep&#8208;Tag Imprinted Polymer Platform for Heterogenous Bio(electro)catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The universal platform Strep&#8208;MIP, built using the synthetic polymer&#8208;based imprinting strategy, recognizes recombinant proteins via the widely used Strep&#8208;tag II affinity peptide. Electrochemistry, surface&#8208;sensitive IR spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations provide comprehensive details of the binding, removal, reusability, and the catalytic performance of the immobilized enzymes, fostering the application of Strep&#8208;MIP in biotechnology.







Abstract
Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are artificial receptors equipped with selective recognition sites for target molecules. One of the most promising strategies for protein MIPs relies on the exploitation of short surface&#8208;exposed protein fragments, termed epitopes, as templates to imprint binding sites in a polymer scaffold for a desired protein. However, the lack of high&#8208;resolution structural data of flexible surface&#8208;exposed regions challenges the selection of suitable epitopes. Here, we addressed this drawback by developing a polyscopoletin&#8208;based MIP that recognizes recombinant proteins via imprinting of the widely used Strep&#8208;tag II affinity peptide (Strep&#8208;MIP). Electrochemistry, surface&#8208;sensitive IR spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations were employed to ensure an utmost control of the Strep&#8208;MIP electrosynthesis. The functionality of this novel platform was verified with two Strep&#8208;tagged enzymes: an O2&#8208;tolerant [NiFe]&#8208;hydrogenase, and an alkaline phosphatase. The enzymes preserved their biocatalytic activities after multiple utilization confirming the efficiency of Strep&#8208;MIP as a general biocompatible platform to confine recombinant proteins for exploitation in biotechnology.

         <title>Transforming Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries with DTPA&#8208;Na: A Synergistic SEI and CEI Engineering Approach for Exceptional Cycling Stability and Self&#8208;Discharge Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy is developed to enhance the stability of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). Incorporation of DTPA&#8208;Na additive enables a synergistic formation of robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI). This strategy effectively regulates the solvation structure and interfacial chemistry, promoting uniform zinc deposition, inhibiting detrimental side reactions, and preventing manganese dissolution, ultimately achieving high&#8208;performance ZIBs.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) hold immense potential for large&#8208;scale energy storage, but their practical implementation faces significant challenges related to the zinc anode, including dendrite formation, corrosion, and hydrogen evolution. This study addresses these challenges by introducing diethylenetriamine pentaacetate sodium salt (DTPA&#8208;Na) as a novel electrolyte additive. DTPA&#8208;Na exhibits a unique dual functionality, enabling the formation of a robust, multi&#8208;layered solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the zinc anode and a stable cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) on the MnOOH cathode. The engineered SEI effectively suppresses interfacial side reactions, facilitates uniform zinc deposition, and mitigates dendrite growth, while the CEI inhibits MnOOH dissolution and detrimental cathode side reactions. This synergistic SEI/CEI engineering approach significantly enhances ZIB performance, achieving remarkable cycling stability and self&#8208;discharge inhibition, as evidenced by the extended lifespan of Zn||Zn symmetrical cells (4400&#8197;hours at 0.5&#8197;mA/cm2) and the exceptional capacity retention of Zn||MnOOH full cells after prolonged rest (98.61&#8201;% after 720&#8197;hours).

This strategy effectively regulates the solvation structure and interfacial chemistry, promoting uniform zinc deposition, inhibiting detrimental side reactions, and preventing manganese dissolution, ultimately achieving high-performance ZIBs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) hold immense potential for large-scale energy storage, but their practical implementation faces significant challenges related to the zinc anode, including dendrite formation, corrosion, and hydrogen evolution. This study addresses these challenges by introducing diethylenetriamine pentaacetate sodium salt (DTPA-Na) as a novel electrolyte additive. DTPA-Na exhibits a unique dual functionality, enabling the formation of a robust, multi-layered solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the zinc anode and a stable cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) on the MnOOH cathode. The engineered SEI effectively suppresses interfacial side reactions, facilitates uniform zinc deposition, and mitigates dendrite growth, while the CEI inhibits MnOOH dissolution and detrimental cathode side reactions. This synergistic SEI/CEI engineering approach significantly enhances ZIB performance, achieving remarkable cycling stability and self-discharge inhibition, as evidenced by the extended lifespan of Zn||Zn symmetrical cells (4400&#8197;hours at 0.5&#8197;mA/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and the exceptional capacity retention of Zn||MnOOH full cells after prolonged rest (98.61&#8201;% after 720&#8197;hours).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unraveling C&#8208;Selective Ring&#8208;Opening of Phosphiranes with Carboxylic Acids and Other Nucleophiles: A Mechanistically&#8208;Driven Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The site selective nucleophilic attack at the carbon site of phosphiranes has been accomplished under metal&#8208;free conditions. The reaction mechanism of this unprecedented transformation is discussed based on experimental and computational studies.







Abstract
Phosphiranes are weak Lewis bases reacting with only a limited number of electrophiles to produce the corresponding phosphiranium ions. These salts are recognized for their propensity to undergo reactions with oxygen pronucleophiles at the phosphorus site, leading to the formation of phosphine oxide adducts. Building on a thorough mechanistic understanding, we have developed an unprecedented approach that enables the selective reaction of carboxylic acids, and other nucleophiles, at the carbon site of phosphiranes. This method involves the photochemical generation of highly reactive carbenes, which react with 1&#8208;mesitylphosphirane to yield ylides. The latter undergoes a stepwise reaction with carboxylic acids, resulting in the production of the desired phosphines. In addition to DFT calculations, we have successfully isolated and fully characterized the key intermediates involved in the reaction.

         <title>Establishing Non&#8208;stoichiometric Ti4O7 Assisted Asymmetrical C&#8208;C Coupling for Highly Energy&#8208;Efficient Electroreduction of Carbon Monoxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring an appropriate support material for Cu&#8208;based electrocatalyst is conducive for stably producing multi&#8208;carbon chemicals from electroreduction of carbon monoxide. However, the insufficient metal&#8208;support adaptability and low conductivity of the support would hinder the C&#8208;C coupling capacity and energy efficiency. Herein, non&#8208;stoichiometric Ti4O7 was incorporated into Cu electrocatalysts (Cu&#8208;Ti4O7), and served as a highly conductive and stable support for highly energy&#8208;efficient electrochemical conversion of CO. The abundant oxygen vacancies originated from ordered lattice defects in Ti4O7 facilitate the water dissociation and the CO adsorption to accelerate the hydrogenation to *COH. The highly adaptable metal&#8208;support interface of Cu&#8208;Ti4O7 enables a direct asymmetrical C&#8208;C coupling between *CO on Cu and *COH on Ti4O7, which significantly lowers the reaction energy barrier for C2+ products formation. Additionally, the excellent electroconductivity of Ti4O7 benefits the reaction charge transfer through robust Cu/Ti4O7 interface for minimizing the energy loss. Thus, the optimized 20Cu&#8208;Ti4O7 catalyst exhibits an impressive selectivity of 96.4% and ultrahigh energy efficiency of 45.1% for multi&#8208;carbon products, along with a remarkable partial current density of 432.6 mA cm&#8208;2. Our study underscores a novel C&#8208;C coupling strategy between Cu and the support material, advancing the development of Cu&#8208;supported catalysts for highly efficient electroreduction of carbon monoxide.</dc:description>

         <title>CO2&#8208;assisted Controllable Synthesis of PdNi Nanoalloys for Highly Selective Hydrogenation of Biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective hydrogenation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;bishydroxymethyltetrahydrofuran (BHMTHF), a vital fuel precursor and solvent, is crucial for biomass refining. Herein, we report highly selective and stable PdNi nanoalloy catalysts for this deep hydrogenation process. A CO2&#8208;assisted green method was developed for the controllable synthesis of various bimetallic and monometallic catalysts. The PdNi/SBA&#8208;15 catalysts with various Pd/Ni ratios exhibited a volcano&#8208;like trend between BHMTHF yield and Pd/Ni ratio. Among all catalysts tested, Pd2Ni1/SBA&#8208;15 achieved the best performance, converting 99.0% of HMF to BHMTHF with 96.0% selectivity, surpassing previously reported catalysts. Additionally, the Pd2Ni1/SBA&#8208;15 catalyst maintained excellent stability even after five recycling runs. Catalyst characterizations (e.g., HAADF&#8208;STEM) and DFT calculations confirmed the successful formation of the alloy structure with electron transfer between Ni and Pd, which accounts for the remarkable performance and stability of the catalyst. This work paves the way for developing highly selective and stable alloy catalysts for biomass valorization.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic Control over Social and Narcissistic Self&#8208;Sorting from Multicomponent Mixtures in Seed&#8208;Initiated Supramolecular Polymerization by Fine&#8208;Tuning of Steric Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers offer an intriguing possibility to transfer molecular properties from the nano&#8208; to the mesoscale. Towards this achievement, seed&#8208;initiated supramolecular polymerization has emerged as a powerful tool, as it prevents unlimited growth and enables size control of the assembly outcome. However, the potential application of the seeding method in the context of complex supramolecular systems is hitherto unclear. Herein we demonstrate that minute differences in molecular design in direct proximity to intermolecular recognition sites govern the molecular packing and in turn dictate the efficacy of seeded polymerization processes. We introduce a stepwise increase in steric demand in the central amino acid residue of a diamide system, which gradually increases the rotational displacement within the aggregated state. This fine&#8208;tuning of the molecular packing directly affects the propensity of the different aggregates to act as seeds for the other supramolecular synthons. In turn this allows us to selectively target specific trapped monomer states in binary mixtures for social or narcissistic seeded polymerization.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light Excitation of Poly&#8208;(para&#8208;Phenylene Ethynylene) Enables Heterogeneous Photocatalytic Oxidations of Amines in Flow.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterogeneous visible light photocatalysis is a compelling approach to address sustainability in synthetic photochemistry. However, the use of solid&#8208;state photocatalysts remains very unpopular in organic synthesis because of their limited accessibility and the black&#8208;box effect associated to the lack of rational between their molecular structure and their photochemical properties. Herein, we disclose the synthesis, characterization, photocatalytic properties and synthetic applications of a simple and readily available solid&#8208;state conjugated organic polymer, poly&#8208;(para&#8208;phenylene ethynylene) 1, which exhibits a strong oxidative power upon irradiation with visible light (E(1*/1&#8226;&#8211;) = +1.67 V vs SCE). Comparisons with structural analogues highlighted the superior photocatalytic activity of this linear semiconductor, on account of its fully conjugated architecture. The associated excited&#8208;state reactivity enabled the transformation of various amines into imines in batch and continuous flow reactors together with straightforward photocatalyst recycling. Mechanistic investigations revealed concomitant photoredox and energy transfer pathways, that led to the formation of the desired products. Ultimately, the inline generation of imines was exploited in telescoped three&#8208;component Ugi reactions (3CR) in batch and flow toward biologically relevant &#945;&#8208;acylaminoamides.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploration of Chemical Space through Automated Reasoning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The vast size of composition space poses a significant challenge for materials chemistry: exhaustive enumeration of potentially interesting compositions is typically infeasible, hindering assessment of important criteria ranging from novelty and stability to cost and performance. We report a tool, Comgen, for the efficient exploration of composition space, which makes use of logical methods from computer science used for proving theorems. We demonstrate how these techniques, which have not previously been applied to materials discovery, can enable reasoning about scientific domain knowledge provided by human experts. Comgen accepts a variety of user&#8208;specified criteria, converts these into an abstract form, and utilises a powerful automated reasoning algorithm to identify compositions that satisfy these user requirements, or prove that the requirements cannot be simultaneously satisfied. In contrast to machine learning techniques, explicitly reasoning about domain knowledge, rather than making inferences from data, ensures that Comgen&#8217;s outputs are fully interpretable and provably correct. Users interact with Comgen through a high&#8208;level Python interface. We illustrate use of the tool with several case studies focused on the search for new ionic conductors.

We report a tool, Comgen, for the efficient exploration of composition space, which makes use of logical methods from computer science used for proving theorems. We demonstrate how these techniques, which have not previously been applied to materials discovery, can enable reasoning about scientific domain knowledge provided by human experts. Comgen accepts a variety of user-specified criteria, converts these into an abstract form, and utilises a powerful automated reasoning algorithm to identify compositions that satisfy these user requirements, or prove that the requirements cannot be simultaneously satisfied. In contrast to machine learning techniques, explicitly reasoning about domain knowledge, rather than making inferences from data, ensures that Comgen&#8217;s outputs are fully interpretable and provably correct. Users interact with Comgen through a high-level Python interface. We illustrate use of the tool with several case studies focused on the search for new ionic conductors. Further, we demonstrate the integration of Comgen into an end-to-end automated workflow to propose and evaluate candidate compositions quantitatively, prior to experimental investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polyethylene Recycling Via Water Activation By Ball Milling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyethylene (PE) is the most prevalent type of plastic waste and also the most challenging to depolymerize because of its inert carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8211;C) bonds.[1] High temperature and noble metals are usually required for depolymerization.[2] To avoid using noble metals, costly reagents and harsh reaction conditions, it is worthwhile but challenging to explore new reaction pathways.[3] We report an unprecedented mechanochemical reaction of PE and water to result in shorter&#8208;chain alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, and ketones (Cn, where n &#8818; 50), with above 80 % of starting carbon converted into these products, which could be a valuable feedstock for re&#8208;entering chemical value chains. This reaction is driven solely by ball milling, without heating and pressurizing. No costly catalysts are used. Instead, only earth&#8208;abundant Al&#8322;O&#8323; was milled with reactants.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation and C&#8210;C Coupling of Aryl Iodides via Bismuth Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Within the emerging field of bismuth redox catalysis, the catalytic formation of C&#8210;C bonds using aryl halides would be highly desirable; yet such a process remains a synthetic challenge. Herein, we present a chemoselective bismuth&#8208;photocatalyzed activation and subsequent coupling of (hetero)aryl iodides with pyrrole derivatives to access C(sp2)&#8210;C(sp2) linkages through C&#8210;H functionalization. This unique reactivity is the result of the bismuth complex featuring two redox state&#8208;dependent interactions with light, which 1) activates the Bi(I) complex for oxidative addition via MLCT, and 2) promotes the homolytic cleavage of aryl Bi(III) intermediates through a LLCT process.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Monomeric Triarylbismuthine Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and isolation of a bismuth&#8208;based analogue of the venerable triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph3PO) has remained a chimera to synthetic chemists for many years, due to its predicted high reactivity and instability. Through the hydrolysis of a cationic fluorotriarylbismuthonium(V) salt, we report here the isolation of unique hydroxytriarylbismuth(V) complexes, which served as precursor for the formation of the elusive monomeric triarylbismuthine oxide Dipp3Bi&#9552;O. Combined spectroscopic, crystallographic and computational studies provided insight into the bonding situation of the first monomeric triorganobismuth oxide complex. The Dipp3Bi&#9552;O and Mes3BiO&#183;LiBArF complex exhibits O&#8208;atom transfer reactivity, an uncommon reactivity feature for Ar3Pn=O.</dc:description>

         <title>Fuel&#8208;driven&#160;&#960;&#8208;conjugated Superstructures to Form Transient Conductive Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite advances in creating dissipative materials with transient properties, such as hydrogels and active droplets, their application remains confined to temporal changes in structural properties. Developing out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium materials whose electronic functions are parameterized by a chemical reaction cycle is challenging. Yet, this class of materials is required to construct biomimetic materials. In contrast to traditional chemical reaction cycles that exploit molecularly dissolved building blocks at thermodynamic equilibrium, we show that fiber structures derived from reactive naphthalene diimide (NDI) building blocks can be used as resting states to form far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium conductive hydrogels after the addition of chemical fuels. Upon fueling the NDI&#8208;derived fibers, a dual&#8208;component activation and deactivation pathway is deduced by kinetic analysis and is absent when using a molecularly dissolved resting state. Investigating the solid&#8208;state morphologies of the structures formed throughout the fuel&#8208;driven reaction cycle using cryo&#8208;EM reveals that the resting thermodynamic fibers evolve to transient thicker fibrils and layered superstructures. We show that the transient redox&#8208;active hydrogels exhibit a nearly threefold increase in electrical conductivity upon fuel consumption before reverting to their original value over hours. These far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium materials are potential candidates in applications such as programmable biorobotics and chemical computing.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Synthesis of MoO 3 &#160;by Surface Oxidation of Mo 2 C (MXene) for Stable Near&#8208;Surface Reactions in Aqueous Aluminum&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) is a promising positive electrode material for aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries due to its high theoretical capacity. However, MoO3&#160;faces several challenges in an aqueous electrolyte, such as easy dissolution of reaction products, volume expansion, and low conductivity, which severely limit its application in aqueous batteries. In this work, we effectively increased the overall conductivity of the electrode by in&#8208;situ growing MoO3&#160;on the Mo2C MXene layer. MXene can effectively inhibit the dissolution and structural loss of MoO3&#160;reaction products. Additionally, the coordination effect of Mo2C and MoO3&#160;achieves a stable near&#8208;surface reaction on the MXene laminates, resulting in the Mo2C/MoO3&#160;composite exhibiting excellent aluminum storage properties (123.5 mAh/g after 200 cycles at 0.4 A/g). The energy storage mechanism of H+/Al3+&#160;co&#8208;insertion/extraction was elucidated through non&#8208;in&#8208;situ characterization, and the promotion effect of Mo2C on MoO3&#160;reaction kinetics was verified by density functional theory calculations. This work provides new insights into improving the stability of AAIB cathodes and extends the application of Mo&#8208;based MXene in aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>A Proteomics Pipeline for Generating Clinical Grade Biomarker Candidates from Data&#8208;Independent Acquisition Mass Spectrometry (DIA&#8208;MS) Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clinical biomarker development has been stymied by inaccurate protein quantification from mass spectrometry (MS) discovery data and a prolonged validation process. To mitigate these issues, we created the Targeted Extraction Assessment of Quantification (TEAQ) software package that uses data&#8208;independent acquisition analysis from a discovery cohort to select precursors, peptides, and proteins that adhere to analytical criteria required for established targeted assays. TEAQ was applied to DIA&#8208;MS data from plasma samples acquired on a new high resolution accurate mass (HRAM) mass spectrometry platform where precursors were evaluated for linearity, specificity, repeatability, reproducibility, and intra&#8208;protein correlation based on 8&#8208; or 11&#8208;point loading curves at three throughputs. This data can be used as a general resource for developing other targeted assays. TEAQ analysis of data from a case and control cohort for inflammatory bowel disease (n=492) identified 1110 signature peptides for 326 quantifiable proteins from the 1179 identified proteins. Applying TEAQ analysis to discovery data will streamline targeted assay development and the transition to validation and clinical studies.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study addresses a challenge in organic synthetic chemistry: the direct cleavage of amide bonds, which is typically hampered by the thermodynamic stability of the C(Ar)&#8211;C(acyl) bond. Previous methods often rely on &#8220;CO&#8221; extrusion&#8208;jointing transition metal&#8208;catalyzed process and require activated tertiary amides, limiting their applicability due to incompatibility with reactive functional groups such as halogens. Herein, we report a transition metal&#8208;free approach for the deamidative cyclization of biaryl diamides via a radical process, yielding dibenzolactam derivatives. Along this line, we have developed the desulfonamidative cyclization of biaryl disulfonamides to produce dibenzosultams through direct nucleophilic aromatic substitution, demonstrating high selectivity for unsymmetrical structures. Additionally, unsymmetrical sulfamoyl biaryl amides, containing both amide and sulfonamide functionalities, can selectively undergo desulfonamidative coupling with the amide to form dibenzolactams, which offers a complementary synthetic pathway to unsymmetric dibenzolactams. These protocols exhibit excellent compatibility with reactive functional groups, including halogens, providing an innovative synthetic toolbox for the development of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials used in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). DMAC&#8208;PDO, incorporating a dibenzolactam as the acceptor unit, serves as an efficient blue TADF emitter with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 23.4%.</dc:description>

         <title>High Configuration Entropy Promises Electrochemical Stability of Chloride Electrolytes for High&#8208;Energy, Long&#8208;Life All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with high ionic conductivity, stability, and interface compatibility are indispensable for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and long&#8208;life all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs), yet there are scarce SSEs with sufficient ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability. In this study, with a high&#8208;entropy SSE (HE&#8208;SSE, Li2.9In0.75Zr0.1Sc0.05Er0.05Y0.05Cl6), we show the high configuration entropy has a thermodynamically positive relationship with the high&#8208;voltage stability. As a result, the ASSBs with HE&#8208;SSE and high&#8208;voltage cathode materials exhibit superior high&#8208;voltage and long&#8208;cycle stability, achieving 250 cycles with 81.4% capacity retention when charged to 4.8 V (vs. Li+/Li), and even 5000 cycles if charged to 4.6 V (vs. Li+/Li).&#160;&#160;Experimental characterizations and density functional theory calculations confirm that the HE&#8208;SSE greatly suppresses the high&#8208;voltage degradation of SSE at the interface, promoting the high&#8208;voltage stability coordinately through high entropy and interface stability. The high entropy design offers a general strategy to simultaneously improve the high&#8208;voltage stability and ionic conductivity of SSEs, creating an avenue to building high&#8208;energy and long&#8208;life ASSBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Monocyclic Luminophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compact luminophores with long emission wavelengths have aroused considerable theoretical and practical interest. Organics with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are also desirable for their longer lifetimes and larger Stokes shifts than fluorescence. Utilizing the low electronic transition energy intrinsic to thiocarbonyl compounds, electron&#8208;withdrawing groups were attached to the 4H&#8208;pyran&#8208;4&#8208;thione core to further lower the excited state energies. The resulting mini&#8208;phosphors were doped into suitable polymer matrices. These purely organic, amorphous materials emitted near&#8208;infrared (NIR) RTP. Having a molar mass of only 162 g&#183;mol&#8208;1, one of the phosphors emitted RTP that peaked at 750 nm, with a very large Stokes shift of 15485 cm&#8208;1 (403 nm). Thanks to the good processability of the polymer film, light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with NIR emission were easily fabricated by coating doped polymer on ultraviolet LEDs. This work provides an intriguing strategy to achieve NIR RTP using compact luminophores.</dc:description>

We report the synthesis and properties of four &#960;&#8208;extended, fused fluorene derivatives with high diradical character, taking advantage of a molecular design where the closed&#8208;shell does not include any Clar sextet, comparatively to a maximum of 5 in the corresponding open&#8208;shell state. This led to an unusual open&#8208;shell triplet ground state with an outstanding singlet&#8208;triplet energy difference (&#916;EST) of ca. 19&#8197;kcal/mol, one of the highest values reported to date for an all&#8208;carbon conjugated scaffold.







Abstract
The synthesis of diradical organic compounds has garnered significant attention due to their thermally accessible spin inversion and optoelectronic properties. Yet, preparing such stable structures with high open&#8208;shell behavior remains challenging. Herein, we report the synthesis and properties of four &#960;&#8208;extended, fused fluorene derivatives with high diradical character, taking advantage of a molecular design where the closed&#8208;shell does not include any Clar sextet, comparatively to a maximum of 5 in the corresponding open&#8208;shell state. This led to an unusual open&#8208;shell triplet ground state with an outstanding singlet&#8208;triplet energy difference (&#916;EST) of ca. 19&#8197;kcal/mol, one of the highest values reported to date for an all&#8208;carbon conjugated scaffold. Incorporation of dithiafulvene units at each end of the molecule (at the five&#8208;membered rings) furnishes extended tetrathiafulvalenes (TTFs) undergoing reversible oxidations to the radical cation and diradical dication. The various pro&#8208;aromatic structures presented herein show highly localized spin density and a limited conjugation due to the confined &#960;&#8208;electrons in the aromatic cycles, as supported by 1H NMR, UV/Visible, EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations.

         <title>Highly Efficient Red/Near&#8208;Infrared Phosphorescence from Doped Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doping the thionation products of phthalimide into its matrix leads to highly efficient red/near&#8208;infrared room temperature phosphorescence with boosted quantum yields of up to ~33&#8201;%. Newly generated emissive clusters and the external heavy atom effect are two key factors to the red&#8208;shifted photoluminescence, while the high efficiency arises from the enhanced exciton generation efficiency and energy transfer process upon doping.







Abstract
Organic red/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials with low toxicity and facile synthesis are highly sought after, particularly for applications in biotechnology and encryption. However, achieving efficient red/NIR RTP emitters has been challenging due to the weak spin&#8208;orbit coupling of organics and the rapid nonradiative decay imposed by the energy gap law. Here we demonstrate highly efficient red/NIR RTP with boosted quantum yields (&#934;ps) of up to 32.96&#8201;% through doping the thionated derivatives of phthalimide (PAI) (MTPAI and DTPAI) into PAI crystals. The red&#8208;shifted photoluminescence (PL) stems from a combination of the external heavy atom effect and the formation of emissive clusters centered around electron&#8208;rich sulfur atoms. Furthermore, the dopants enhance exciton generation efficiency and facilitate energy transfer from smaller PAI units to larger aggregates, leading to dramatically increased &#934;p. This strategy proves universal, opening possibilities for acquiring long&#8208;wavelength RTP with tunable photophysical properties. The doped crystals exhibit promising applications in optical waveguides and encryption paper/ink. This research provides a practical approach to obtaining long&#8208;wavelength RTP materials and offers valuable insights into the mechanisms governing host&#8208;guest systems.

         <title>Asymmetrified Benzothiadiazole&#8208;Based Solid Additives Enable All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with Efficiency Over 19&#8201;%</title>

         <dc:description>
Two electron&#8208;deficient isomers, 4,5&#8208;difluorobenzo&#8208;c&#8208;1,2,5&#8208;thiadiazole (SF&#8208;1) and 5,6&#8208;difluorobenzo&#8208;c&#8208;1,2,5&#8208;thiadiazole (SF&#8208;2), were designed as solid additives to optimize the properties of PM6&#8201;:&#8201;PY&#8208;DT blend. Compared to the as&#8208;cast device, SF&#8208;1&#8208; and SF&#8208;2&#8208;treated devices displayed regulated fibrillar donor&#8208;acceptor network, improved exciton diffusion length, and thus enhanced power conversion efficiencies approaching 19&#8201;%, which is one of rare solid additives for high&#8208;performance all&#8208;polymer organic solar cells.







Abstract
Disordered polymer chain entanglements within all&#8208;polymer blends limit the formation of optimal donor&#8208;acceptor phase separation. Therefore, developing effective methods to regulate morphology evolution is crucial for achieving optimal morphological features in all&#8208;polymer organic solar cells (APSCs). In this study, two isomers, 4,5&#8208;difluorobenzo&#8208;c&#8208;1,2,5&#8208;thiadiazole (SF&#8208;1) and 5,6&#8208;difluorobenzo&#8208;c&#8208;1,2,5&#8208;thiadiazole (SF&#8208;2), were designed as solid additives based on the widely&#8208;used electron&#8208;deficient benzothiadiazole unit in nonfullerene acceptors. The incorporation of SF&#8208;1 or SF&#8208;2 into PM6&#8201;:&#8201;PY&#8208;DT blend induces stronger molecular packing via molecular interaction, leading to the formation of continuous interpenetrated networks with suitable phase&#8208;separation and vertical distribution. Furthermore, after treatment with SF&#8208;1 and SF&#8208;2, the exciton diffusion lengths for PY&#8208;DT films are extended to over 40&#8197;nm, favoring exciton diffusion and charge transport. The asymmetrical SF&#8208;2, characterized by an enhanced dipole moment, increases the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PM6&#8201;:&#8201;PY&#8208;DT&#8208;based device to 18.83&#8201;% due to stronger electrostatic interactions. Moreover, a ternary device strategy boosts the PCE of SF&#8208;2&#8208;treated APSC to over 19&#8201;%. This work not only demonstrates one of the best performances of APSCs but also offers an effective approach to manipulate the morphology of all&#8208;polymer blends using rational&#8208;designed solid additives.

&lt;p&gt;Two electron-deficient isomers, 4,5-difluorobenzo-&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-1,2,5-thiadiazole (SF-1) and 5,6-difluorobenzo-&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-1,2,5-thiadiazole (SF-2), were designed as solid additives to optimize the properties of PM6&#8201;:&#8201;PY-DT blend. Compared to the as-cast device, SF-1- and SF-2-treated devices displayed regulated fibrillar donor-acceptor network, improved exciton diffusion length, and thus enhanced power conversion efficiencies approaching 19&#8201;%, which is one of rare solid additives for high-performance all-polymer organic solar cells.

         <title>Gas Tunnel Engineering of Prolyl Hydroxylase Reprograms Hypoxia Signaling in Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The gas tunnel of PHD2, an iron&#8208;based O2 sensing enzyme, is engineered using a computation&#8208;guided rational design approach. The engineered mutants exhibit an increased rate of gas transport to the active site, along with increased catalytic activity in vitro. These mutants also display enhanced intracellular activity demonstrating the ability to reprogram hypoxia signaling by activating PHD2.







Abstract
Cells have evolved intricate mechanisms for recognizing and responding to changes in oxygen (O2) concentrations. Here, we have reprogrammed cellular hypoxia (low O2) signaling via gas tunnel engineering of prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2), a non&#8208;heme iron dependent O2 sensor. Using computational modeling and protein engineering techniques, we identify a gas tunnel and critical residues therein that limit the flow of O2 to PHD2&#8217;s catalytic core. We show that systematic modification of these residues can open the constriction topology of PHD2&#8217;s gas tunnel. Using kinetic stopped&#8208;flow measurements with NO as a surrogate diatomic gas, we demonstrate up to 3.5&#8208;fold enhancement in its association rate to the iron center of tunnel&#8208;engineered mutants. Our most effectively designed mutant displays 9&#8208;fold enhanced catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM=830&#177;40&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) in hydroxylating a peptide mimic of hypoxia inducible transcription factor HIF&#8208;1&#945;, as compared to WT PHD2 (kcat/KM=90&#177;9&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1). Furthermore, transfection of plasmids that express designed PHD2 mutants in HEK&#8208;293T mammalian cells reveal significant reduction of HIF&#8208;1&#945; and downstream hypoxia response transcripts under hypoxic conditions of 1&#8201;% O2. Overall, these studies highlight activation of PHD2 as a new pathway to reprogram hypoxia responses and HIF signaling in cells.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Design of Bicyclic Helical Peptides That Target the Oncogene &#946;&#8208;Catenin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bicyclic peptide is reported that combines two hydrocarbon staples with i,i+4 and i,i+3 spacing, respectively. In the resulting i,i+4,i+7 crosslink topology, a central spiro center connects two macrocycles that are formed during ring&#8208;closing metathesis. After affinity maturation, we obtain a high&#8208;affinity binder of the oncogenic protein &#946;&#8208;catenin which inhibits the Wnt signaling pathway in a cell&#8208;based assay.







Abstract
The inhibition of intracellular protein&#8208;protein interactions is challenging, in particular, when involved interfaces lack pronounced cavities. The transcriptional co&#8208;activator protein and oncogene &#946;&#8208;catenin is a prime example of such a challenging target. Despite extensive targeting efforts, available high&#8208;affinity binders comprise only large molecular weight inhibitors. This hampers the further development of therapeutically useful compounds. Herein, we report the design of a considerably smaller peptidomimetic scaffold derived from the &#945;&#8208;helical &#946;&#8208;catenin&#8208;binding motif of Axin. Sequence maturation and bicyclization provided a stitched peptide with an unprecedented crosslink architecture. The binding mode and site were confirmed by a crystal structure. Further derivatization yielded a &#946;&#8208;catenin inhibitor with single&#8208;digit micromolar activity in a cell&#8208;based assay. This study sheds light on how to design helix mimetics with reduced molecular weight thereby improving their biological activity.

Herein, a Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive protocol was developed for the synthesis of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted silacyclobutanes, which are well&#8208;known lynchpin intermediates in organosilicon synthesis. Unlike conventional methods, our protocol elegantly avoids the use of moisture&#8208; and air&#8208;sensitive Grignard or lithium reagents, offering a markedly more step&#8208;efficient and functionally tolerant approach. was developed.







Abstract
While significant progress has been made in the area of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening and formal cycloaddition reactions of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted silacyclobutanes (SCBs), synthesizing these SCBs&#8212;particularly those bearing additional functional groups&#8212;continues to present synthetic challenges. In this context, we present a novel Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive coupling reaction that combines 1&#8208;chloro&#8208;substituted silacyclobutanes with aryl or vinyl halides and pseudohalides, thereby obviating the need for organometallic reagents. This method facilitates the generation of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted silacyclobutanes with a remarkable tolerance for various functional groups. This approach serves as a complementary and more step&#8208;economical alternative to the commonly used yet moisture&#8208; and air&#8208;sensitive nucleophilic substitution reactions involving Grignard or lithium reagents. Our initial mechanistic studies indicate that this reaction is initiated by oxidative cleavage of the Si&#8722;Cl bond in 1&#8208;chlorosilacyclobutanes, which represents a distinct mechanism from the previously documented reductive coupling processes involving carbon electrophiles and chlorosilanes.

         <title>Tracking Minority Species in Redox Reactions: A Quantitative Combined XAS and Modulation Excitation Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports on the use of modulation excitation through periodic switches of electrical potential coupled with X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy to probe the redox reaction of Fe(II) and Fe(III) species in a volume containing only 30 pmol of Fe.







Abstract
Understanding the nature of intermediates/active species in reactions is a major challenge in chemistry. This is because spectator species typically dominate the experimentally derived data and consequently active phase contributions are masked. Transient methods offer a means to bypass this difficulty. In particular, modulation excitation with phase&#8208;sensitive detection (ME&#8208;PSD) provides a mechanism to distinguish between spectator and reacting species. Herein, modulation excitation (ME) time&#8208;resolved (energy dispersive) X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, assisted by phase sensitive detection (PSD) analysis, has been applied to the study of a liquid phase process; in this case the classic ferrocyanide/ferricyanide redox couple. Periodic switches of the electrical potential (anodic/cathodic) enabled the use of the ME approach. Structural changes at fractions as low as 2&#8201;% of the total number of electroactive species were detected within the X&#8208;ray beam probe volume containing ~30&#8197;pmol of Fe(II)/Fe(III).

Structural changes at fractions as low as 2&#8201;% of the total number of electroactive species were detected within the X-ray beam probe volume containing ~30&#8197;pmol of Fe(II)/Fe(III).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Non&#8208;Ionic Peterson&#8208;Type Olefination Reactivity and its Use in a Silicon&#8208;Promoted Carbonyl&#8208;Carbonyl Cross Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual [2+2] cycloaddition reaction between the Si=C double bond of a silene and the C=O bond of a variety of carbonyl compounds produces four&#8208;membered silaoxetane heterocycles. These intermediates can be characterized, and engage in alkene&#8208;forming retro&#8208;cycloaddition reactions by the addition of SiO2. Moreover, the silene olefination reagent can be formed in&#8197;situ, giving rise to a new one&#8208;pot silicon&#8208;based reductive carbonyl&#8208;carbonyl cross coupling methodology.







Abstract
The [2+2] cycloaddition reaction between the Si=C double bond of adamantylsilene and the carbonyl group of aliphatic, aromatic or acetylenic ketones and aldehydes is demonstrated. The product of this reaction that is central to a non&#8208;ionic version of the Peterson olefination is an unusual four&#8208;membered 1,2&#8208;silaoxetane heterocycle that was characterized spectroscopically and crystallographically. In the presence of SiO2, the silaoxetane undergoes retro&#8208;cycloaddition with the formation of alkene products. As the [2+2] cycloaddition proceeds without the necessity of any base, enolizable ketones can be converted into olefins. In addition, it is shown that the adamantylsilene can be produced in&#8197;situ by a sila&#8208;Peterson reaction, providing valuable input for the development of a new one&#8208;pot silicon&#8208;based reductive carbonyl&#8208;carbonyl cross coupling methodology.

         <title>Recognition and order of multiple sidechains by metal&#8211;organic framework enhances the separation of hexane isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ordering of multiple sidechains on a metal&#8211;organic framework is achieved by the assembly of linkers that differ only in the appended functional groups at a chiral centre. The strain induced by the functional groups defines the conformation of each linker and drives their ordering in the crystal structure of the framework. The pore environments formed by this assembly have well&#8208;defined adsorption sites for hexane isomers and enhance their separation.







Abstract
Porous materials perform molecular sorting, separation and transformation by interaction between their framework structures and the substrates. Proteins also interact with molecules to effect chemical transformations, but rely on the precise sequence of the amino acid building units along a common polypeptide backbone to maximise their performance. Design strategies that positionally order sidechains over a defined porous framework to diversify the internal surface chemistry would enhance control of substrate processing. Here we show that different sidechains can be ordered over a metal&#8211;organic framework through recognition of their distinct chemistries during synthesis. The sidechains are recognised because each one forces the common building unit that defines the backbone of the framework into a different conformation in order to form the extended structure. The resulting sidechain ordering affords hexane isomer separation performance superior to that of the same framework decorated only with sidechains of a single kind. The separated molecules adopt distinct arrangements within the resulting modified pore geometry, reflecting their strongly differentiated environments precisely created by the ordered sidechains. The development of frameworks that recognize and order multiple sidechain functionality by conformational control offers tailoring of the internal surfaces within families of porous materials to direct interactions at the molecular level.

         <title>Diphenylacetylene&#8208;Incorporating Octaphyrin: A Rigid Macrocycle with Readily Separable Conformational Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Expanded porphyrins with diphenylacetylene as a key building block have been prepared. Owing to the rigidity of the resulting macrocycle, conformational isomers can be isolated, unlike known, flexible expanded porphyrins. The irreversible conformational inversion, coupled with the distinct spectral and color features of the isomers, allowed us to fabricate a new accumulated thermal sensor capable of indicating exposure to high temperatures.







Abstract
An expanded carbaporphyrinoid analogue, octaphyrin(2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1), containing two rigid diphenylacetylene moieties is reported. In contrast to traditional pyrrolic macrocycles where flexible conformers coexist in dynamic equilibrium, this macrocycle exists as two separable, conformationally stable stereoisomers, denoted as 1A and 1B. The conformational effect of both conformers, as well as their protonated forms, were thoroughly studied using NMR spectroscopy, UV/Vis, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. Importantly, heating conformer 1B leads to its irreversible conversion to 1A, whereas in its protonated form, 1A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MSA undergoes irreversible transformation to 1B&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MSA at lower temperatures. These temperature&#8208;dependent features establish a foundation for developing new accumulated heat sensors, as demonstrated by the use of the present octaphyrins as a customized thermochromic indicator in steam sterilization. The present study thus underscores how the conformational rigidity of these new polypyrrolic macrocycles imparts properties that are distinct from historically flexible expanded porphyrinoids.

         <title>Steering the Selectivity of CORR from Acetate to Ethanol via Tailoring the Thermodynamic Activity of Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal approach was developed to tune the selectivity of Cu&#8208;based catalysts in CORR from acetate to ethanol by tailoring the thermodynamic activity of water. The faradaic efficiencies of ethanol and alcohol can reach 42.5&#8201;% and 55.1&#8201;% at 700&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. The ability to control the selectivity of CORR opens up new possibilities for synthesizing a wider range of valuable chemical products from CO2.







Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of carbon monoxide (CO) into oxygenated C2+ products at high rates and selectivity offers a promising approach for the two&#8208;step conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2). However, a major drawback of the CO electrochemical reduction in alkaline electrolyte is the preference for the acetate pathway over the more valuable ethanol pathway. Recent research has shed light on the significant impact of thermodynamic water activity on the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction pathways, but less is understood for the electrochemical reduction of CO. In this study, we investigated how the water activity at the electrified interface can be enhanced to adjust the selectivity between acetate and ethanol. We employed an ionomer modifier to lower the local concentration of alkali ions (via Donnan exclusion), successfully enhancing ethanol production while suppressing acetate formation. We observed a remarkable improvement in the Faradaic efficiency of ethanol and alcohol (i.&#8201;e. ethanol, propanol etc), which reached 42.5&#8201;% and 55.1&#8201;%, respectively, at a current density of 700&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The partial current densities of ethanol and alcohol reached 698 and 942&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 2000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, we achieved a 3.7&#8208;fold increase in the ethanol/acetate ratio, providing clear evidence of our successful modulation of product selectivity.

         <title>Two&#8208;Photon Clusteroluminescence Enabled by Through&#8208;Space Conjugation for In Vivo Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;Photon clusteroluminescence (with emission wavelength up to 688&#8197;nm) was achieved in small clusteroluminogens (CLgens) with only two isolated heteroatomic units through the efficient and n&#8208;electron&#8208;involved through&#8208;space conjugation, which promotes the in vivo bioimaging of CLgens with excellent biocompatibility.







Abstract
Clusteroluminescence (CL) materials without largely conjugated structures have gained significant attention due to their unique photophysical properties and potential in bioimaging. However, low luminescence efficiency and short emission wavelength limit their development. This work designs three luminogens with CL properties (CLgens) by introducing n&#8208;electron&#8208;involved through&#8208;space conjugation (TSC) into diarylmethane. Apart from single&#8208;photon excited long&#8208;wavelength (686&#8197;nm) and high&#8208;efficiency (29&#8201;%) CL, two&#8208;photon clusteroluminescence (TPCL) is successfully achieved in such small luminogens with only two isolated heteroatomic units.

     alt="Two-Photon Clusteroluminescence Enabled by Through-Space Conjugation for In Vivo Bioimaging"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-Photon clusteroluminescence (with emission wavelength up to 688&#8197;nm) was achieved in small clusteroluminogens (CLgens) with only two isolated heteroatomic units through the efficient and &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-electron-involved through-space conjugation, which promotes the in vivo bioimaging of CLgens with excellent biocompatibility.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clusteroluminescence (CL) materials without largely conjugated structures have gained significant attention due to their unique photophysical properties and potential in bioimaging. However, low luminescence efficiency and short emission wavelength limit their development. This work designs three luminogens with CL properties (CLgens) by introducing &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-electron-involved through-space conjugation (TSC) into diarylmethane. Apart from single-photon excited long-wavelength (686&#8197;nm) and high-efficiency (29&#8201;%) CL, two-photon clusteroluminescence (TPCL) is successfully achieved in such small luminogens with only two isolated heteroatomic units. TSC stabilized in the aggregate state has been proven to realize efficient spatial electron delocalization similar to conventionally conjugated compounds. Encouraged by the excellent TPCL properties, two-photon imaging of blood vessels in vivo and biocompatibility verification utilizing CLgens are also achieved. This work illustrates the essential role of TSC in promoting nonlinear optical properties of CLgens and may facilitate further design and development of the next generation of bioprobes with excellent biocompatibility.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Individually Tunable Energy Levels of Oligomers Based on N&#8722;B&#8592;N Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of monodisperse oligomers based on electron&#8208;accepting double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) unit with individually tunable energy levels were developed. This unique energy level tuning is attributed to the separation of LUMO and HOMO at the atomic scale of the BNBP unit and the different contributions of charge transfer transitions in the excited states.







Abstract
Opto&#8208;electronic properties and device performance of organic semiconductors are mainly determined by energy levels of their frontier molecular orbitals, e.g. lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (ELUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (EHOMO) in the ground state, first singlet state (ES1) and first triplet state (ET1) in the excited state. These energy levels are always intricately intertwined. Herein, we report a series of monodisperse oligomers based on double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) units. With the increasing number of repeating units, the oligomers exhibit gradually downshifted ELUMO and nearly unchanged EHOMO due to the different distribution of the frontier molecular orbitals of the oligomers. Moreover, the oligomers exhibit gradually decreasing ES1 and nearly unchanged ET1 because of the different contributions of the charge transfer component in the excited state. This work provides new insight into energy level tuning of organic semiconductors, which is important for high&#8208;performance organic opto&#8208;electronic devices.

         <title>Iridium(III) Photosensitizers Induce Simultaneous Pyroptosis and Ferroptosis for Multi&#8208;Network Synergistic Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first case of metal&#8208;based small molecule dual&#8208;inducers of pyroptosis and ferroptosis is reported here. The iridium(III)&#8208;triphenylamine photosensitizers, IrC and IrF, can induce DNA damage&#8208;related gasdermin D (GSDMD)&#8208;mediated pyroptosis, along with regulating iron stress&#8208;related gasdermin E (GSDME)&#8208;mediated pyroptosis and glutathione peroxidase&#8197;4 (GPX4) depletion synergistically promoted ferroptosis, and further trigger a strong immune response.







Abstract
The integration of pyroptosis and ferroptosis hybrid cell death induction to augment immune activation represents a promising avenue for anti&#8208;tumor treatment, but there is a lack of research. Herein, we developed two iridium (III)&#8208;triphenylamine photosensitizers, IrC and IrF, with the capacity to disrupt redox balance and induce photo&#8208;driven cascade damage to DNA and Kelch&#8208;like ECH&#8208;associated protein&#8197;1 (KEAP1). The activation of the absent in melanoma&#8197;2 (AIM2)&#8208;related cytoplasmic nucleic acid&#8208;sensing pathway, triggered by damaged DNA, leads to the induction of gasdermin D (GSDMD)&#8208;mediated pyroptosis. Simultaneously, iron homeostasis, regulated by the KEAP1/nuclear factor erythroid 2&#8208;related factor&#8197;2 (NRF2)/heme oxygenase&#8197;1 (HO&#8208;1) pathway, serves as a pivotal bridge, facilitating not only the induction of gasdermin&#8197;E (GSDME)&#8208;mediated non&#8208;canonical pyroptosis, but also ferroptosis in synergy with glutathione peroxidase&#8197;4 (GPX4) depletion. The collaborative action of pyroptosis and ferroptosis generates a synergistic effect that elicits immunogenic cell death, stimulates a robust immune response and effectively inhibits tumor growth in vivo. Our work introduces the first metal&#8208;based small molecule dual&#8208;inducers of pyroptosis and ferroptosis for potent cancer immunotherapy, and highlights the significance of iron homeostasis as a vital hub connecting synergistic effects of pyroptosis and ferroptosis.

         <title>Highly Diffusive Nonluminescent Carriers in Hybrid Phase Lead Triiodide Perovskite Nanowires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photogenerated carriers can be captured by phase transition induced defects (PTIDs) formed by hybrid&#8208;phase within the same MAPbI3 single crystal and then be &#8220;protected&#8221; form radiative and non&#8208;radiative recombinations. The mobility of PTID&#8208;dressed nonluminescent carriers is successfully promoted by about 14&#8208;fold to as high as 1345.2&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, comparing with band&#8208;edge free carriers at room temperature. What's more, facilitated by this highly diffusive nonluminescent carrier within, the MAPbI3 NWs&#8208;based photodetector's responsivity is promoted by about three times.







Abstract
Crystal structural rearrangements unavoidably introduce defects into materials, where even these small changes in local lattice structure could arouse a prominent impact on the overall nature of crystals. Contrary to the traditional notion that defects obstruct carrier transport, herein, we report a promoted transport mechanism of nonluminescent carriers in single&#8208;crystalline CH3NH3PbI3 nanowires (1345.2&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, about a 14&#8208;fold improvement), enabled by the phase transition induced defects (PTIDs). Carriers captured by PTIDs evade both the radiative and non&#8208;radiative recombinations during the incomplete tetragonal&#8208;to&#8208;orthorhombic phase transition at low temperatures, forming a specific nonluminescent state that exhibits an efficient long&#8208;distance transport and thereby realize a prominent enhancement of photocurrent responsivity for photodetector applications. The findings provide broader insights into the carrier transport mechanism in perovskite semiconductors and have significant implications for their rational design for photoelectronic applications at varied operating temperatures.

         <title>A Grafting Hydrogen&#8208;bonded Organic Framework for Benchmark Selectivity of C2H2/CO2 Separation under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reticular chemistry and pore engineering have garnered significant advancements in metal&#8208;organic frameworks and covalent organic frameworks, leveraging robust metal&#8208;coordination and covalent bonds. However, these achievements remain elusive in hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks, hindered by their inherent weakness in hydrogen bonding. Herein, we strategically manipulate the porosity of hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks through a grafting approach, culminating in the synthesis of two isomorphic HOFs, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;99 and HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;100, with distinct pore environments. Remarkably, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;100, with its microporous architecture, not only showcases exceptional stability but also achieves unparalleled separation efficiency and ultrahigh selectivity for C2H2/CO2 mixtures (50/50, v/v) under ambient conditions. Its IAST selectivity value of 201 stands as a benchmark, towering over all previously reported HOFs. The pore of HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;100 boasts an electrostatic potential highly favourable for C2H2 adsorption, as evidenced by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealing multiple hydrogen bonding interactions between C2H2 molecules and the framework. In situ gas&#8208;carrier powder X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis underscores the adaptability of pore structure, dynamically adjusting its orientation in response to C2H2, thereby enabling a highly efficient and specific separation of C2H2/CO2 mixtures through specific adsorptive interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrated Monomer Synthesis and Framework Assembly: Achieving Isoreticular Modulation of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Systematic construction of isoreticular hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) promises tailored material properties crucial for diverse applications, yet is challenging due to the weak, flexible, and non&#8208;directional nature of hydrogen bonds. Herein, we develop an &#8220;integrated monomer synthesis&#8208;framework assembly&#8221; (ISA) methodology for constructing a series of isoreticular HOFs. Unlike traditional methods where monomers are first synthesized and then assembled into HOFs, the ISA system employs dicyandiamide rigid hydrogen&#8208;bonded hexameric clusters as connecting nodes to covalently react with planarized C3&#8208;symmetric cyano&#8208;precursors (C3&#8208;CPs) to generate diaminotriazine (DAT) monomers, while simultaneously inducing the directional assembly into isoreticular (6,3)&#8208;net hcb topological DAT&#8208;C6&#8208;HOFs. The pore sizes and microenvironments of the resulting DAT&#8208;C6&#8208;HOFs can be precisely tuned by varying the structural modulation (length and steric hindrance) of the &#960;&#8208;bridge on C3&#8208;CPs, enabling highly selective sensing towards perfluorooctanoic acid over other homologous molecules, that are difficult to be separated and detected by chromatography. Overall, the ISA methodology facilitates the scalable creation of families of isostructural HOFs and provides a customized structural platform for investigating factors beyond topology that impact the capturing, releasing, and responding to guest molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Hydrogen Acceptor&#8211;Donor Enables Relay Mechanism for Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction is a crucial process for sustainable ammonia production. However, to maximize ammonia yield efficiency, this technology inevitably operates at the potentials more negative than 0 V vs. RHE, leading to high energy consumption and competitive hydrogen evolution.&#160;To eradicate this issue, hydrogen tungsten bronze (HxWO3) as reversible hydrogen donor&#8208;acceptor is partnered with copper (Cu) to enable a relay mechanism at potentials positive than 0 V vs. RHE, which involves rapid intercalation of H into HxWO3 lattice, prompt de&#8208;intercalation of the lattice H and transfer onto Cu, and spontaneous H&#8208;mediated nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion on Cu.&#160;The resulting catalysts demonstrated a high ammonia yield rate of 3332.9&#177;34.1 mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and a Faraday efficiency of ~100 % at 0.10 V vs. RHE, displaying a record&#8208;low estimated energy consumption of 17.6 kWh kgammonia&#8722;1. Using these catalysts, we achieve continuous ammonia production in an enlarged flow cell at a real energy consumption of 17.0 kWh kgammonia&#8722;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclic Multi&#8208;Site Chelation for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lewis base 2D covalent organic frameworks, TFT&#8208;COF and TT&#8208;COF are applied to mitigate energetic mismatches and introduce effective n&#8208;type surface energetics and band bending via cyclic, multi&#8208;site chelation with undercoordinated lead ions. Such a multi&#8208;site chelation effect enables a high efficiency of 25.64&#8201;% (certified 24.94&#8201;%) and excellent stability in the inverted perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
Trap&#8208;assisted non&#8208;radiative recombination losses and moisture&#8208;induced degradation significantly impede the development of highly efficient and stable inverted (p&#8211;i&#8211;n) perovskite solar cells (PSCs), which require high&#8208;quality perovskite bulk. In this research, we mitigate these challenges by integrating thermally stable perovskite layers with Lewis base covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The ordered pore structure and surface binding groups of COFs facilitate cyclic, multi&#8208;site chelation with undercoordinated lead ions, enhancing the perovskite quality across both its bulk and grain boundaries. This process not only reduces defects but also promotes improved energy alignment through n&#8208;type doping at the surface. The inclusion of COF dopants in p&#8211;i&#8211;n devices achieves power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25.64&#8201;% (certified 24.94&#8201;%) for a 0.0748&#8208;cm2 device and 23.49&#8201;% for a 1&#8208;cm2 device. Remarkably, these devices retain 81&#8201;% of their initial PCE after 978&#8197;hours of accelerated aging at 85&#176;C, demonstrating remarkable durability. Additionally, COF&#8208;doped devices demonstrate excellent stability under illumination and in moist conditions, even without encapsulation.

         <title>[5]Helicene Based &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Macrocycles with Persistent Figure&#8208;Eight and M&#246;bius Shapes: Efficient Synthesis, Chiral Resolution and Bright Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#960;&#8208;Conjugated chiral shape&#8208;persistent molecular nanocarbons hold great potential as chiroptical materials, though their synthesis remains a considerable challenge. Here, we present a simple approach using Suzuki coupling of a [5]helicene building block with various aromatic units, enabling the one&#8208;pot synthesis of a series of chiral macrocycles with persistent figure&#8208;eight and M&#246;bius shapes. Single&#8208;crystal structures of 7 compounds were solved, and 22 enantiomers were separated by preparative chiral HPLC. A notable pyrene&#8208;bridged figure&#8208;eight macrocycle, with its rigid, fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated and overcrowded structure, exhibited pure excimer emission and outstanding circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties, including a large dissymmetric factor (|glum| = 3.8 &#215; 10&#8722;2) and significant CPL brightness (BCPL = 710.5 M&#8208;1cm&#8208;1). This method provides a versatile synthetic platform for producing various chiral D2&#8208;symmetric figure&#8208;eight macrocycles and singly or triply twisted M&#246;bius macrocycles with C2 and D3 symmetry, offering tunable chiroptical properties for CPL applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Dearomative [1,5]&#8208;Sigmatropic Carbon Shift of Heterole&#8208;Fused Norcaradienes Enabled Concise Helicenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In contrast to the locked fluxionality of norcaradienes fused by benzene, unexplored less aromatic heterole&#8208;fused norcaradienes, creatively generated by intramolecular hydroarylation of heteroaryl alkynylcyclopropanes, reserve a balancing fluxionality that permits a dearomative 1,5&#8208;sigmatropic carbon shift of norcaradienes akin to the reduced aromaticity of heterole. This &#8220;walk&#8221; shift was confirmed by the isolation of a cycloheptatriene species derived from ring&#8208;expansion of a dearomatized alkynylated heterole&#8208;fused norcaradiene. A following ester&#8208;directed ring&#8208;opening rearomatization of these dearomatized heterole&#8208;fused norcaradienes gives the products featuring migratory acylmethyls that are competent for helicenation with the neighboring (hetero)arenes via (formal) dehydrative alkenylation. Such balancing reactivity of heterole&#8208;fused norcaradienes will open up the opportunity for the development of controllable reactions of fused norcaradienes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis of molecular host&#8208;guest complexes with enhanced performance, relative to those of their components, is a central theme in supramolecular chemistry. Here we explore a host&#8208;guest system consisting of an atomically precise gold nanocluster bound inside a zinc porphyrin nanoring. UV&#8208;vis absorption and fluorescence titrations with different sized nanorings revealed strong binding between a pyridinethiol&#8208;coated Au25 nanocluster and a nanoring consisting of six zinc porphyrin units, and complexation is confirmed by mass spectrometry. Formation of this assembly enhances the stability of the gold nanocluster. The host&#8208;guest complex also exhibits remarkable activity and selectivity for photochemical CO2 to CO conversion and singlet oxygen generation.</dc:description>

         <title>The Fatal Mushroom Neurotoxin Muscarine is Released from a Harmless Phosphorylated Precursor upon Cellular Injury</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>l&#8208;(+)&#8208;Muscarine (1)&#8208;producing mushrooms pose a severe threat to human health as ingestion can result in circulatory collapse or even death. However, their metabolic profile is surprisingly poorly understood, including knowledge of poison release and potentially toxic congeners. In the mycelium of the 1&#8208;producing fool&#8217;s funnel mushroom Clitocybe rivulosa, we identified 4&#8217;&#8208;phosphomuscarine (2) as the major natural product. Its structure was elucidated by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and by comparison with a synthesized reference. We also detected this previously overlooked phosphorylated compound in the fiber cap mushrooms Pseudosperma spectrale and Inocybe nitidiuscula. Studies on the activation of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 indicate only weak affinity of 2 to this target. Furthermore, we present biological evidence that muscaridine (3), a quaternary amine congener related to and co&#8208;occurring with 1, does not activate the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 on human embryonic kidney cells. Our work provides important insight into the metabolic profile and the pharmacology of some of the most poisonous mushrooms. As the harmless 2 can liberate the potentially fatal 1 by unspecific enzymatic ester cleavage, these results are highly relevant for emergency medicine to estimate the true toxicity of these mushrooms.</dc:description>

         <title>Triflic Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrative Amination of 2&#8208;Arylethanols with Weak N&#8208;Nucleophiles in Hexafluoroisopropanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic deoxyamination of readily available 2&#8208;arylethanols offers an appealing, simple, and straightforward means of accessing &#946;&#8208;(hetero)arylethylamines of biological interest. Yet, it currently represents a great challenge to synthetic chemistry. In most cases, the alcohol has to be either pre&#8208;activated in situ or converted into a reactive carbonyl intermediate, limiting the substrate scope for some methods. Examples of direct dehydrative amination of 2&#8208;arylethanols are still scarce. Here, we describe a catalytic protocol based on the synergy of triflic acid and hexafluoroisopropanol, which enables the direct and stereospecific amination of a broad array of 2&#8208;arylethanols, and does not require any pre&#8208;activation of the alcohol. This approach yields high value&#8208;added products incorporating sulfonamide, amide, urea, and aniline functionalities. In addition, this approach was applied to the sulfidation of 2&#8208;arylethanols. Mechanistic experiments and DFT computations indicate the formation of phenonium ions as key intermediates in the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Formamidinium Incorporates into Rb&#8208;based Non&#8208;perovskite Phases in Solar Cell Formulations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite materials, such as formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3), are among the most promising emerging photovoltaic materials. However, the spontaneous phase transition from the photoactive perovskite phase to an inactive non&#8208;perovskite phase complicates the application of FAPbI3&#160;in solar cells. To remedy this, alkali metal cations, most often Cs+, Rb+or K+, are included during perovskite synthesis to stabilize the photoactive phase. The atomic&#8208;level mechanisms of stabilization are complex. While Cs+&#160;dopes directly into the perovskite lattice, Rb+&#160;does not, but instead forms an additional non&#8208;perovskite phase, and the mechanism by which Rb confers increased stability remains unclear. Here, we use&#160;1H&#8211;87Rb double resonance NMR experiments to show that FA+&#160;incorporates into the Rb&#8208;based non&#8208;perovskite phases (FAyRb1&#8208;yPb2Br5&#160;and&#160;&#948;&#8208;FAyRb1&#8208;yPbI3) for both bromide and iodide perovskite formulations. This is demonstrated by changes in the&#160;1H and&#160;87Rb chemical shifts,&#160;1H&#8211;87Rb heteronuclear correlation spectra, and&#160;87Rb{1H} REDOR spectra. Simulation of the REDOR dephasing curves suggests up to ~60% FA+&#160;incorporation into the inorganic Rb&#8208;based phase for the bromide system. In light of these results, we hypothesize that the substitution of FA+&#160;into the non&#8208;perovskite phase may contribute to the greater stability conferred by Rb salts in the synthesis of FA&#8208;based perovskites.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Structure Determination by 3D Electron Diffraction of the Extra&#8208;large Pore Zeolite ITQ&#8208;70</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we present the synthesis, characterization, and structural analysis of a novel zeolite, ITQ&#8208;70, using 3D electron diffraction tomography. This unique material was synthesized under alkaline conditions, employing tetrakis(diethylamino)phosphonium as organic structure&#8208;directing agent, leading to the formation of a pure silica zeolite. ITQ&#8208;70 is distinguished by its extra&#8208;large pore apertures, which extend along all three axes and intersect one to each other. A notable feature of this zeolite is the presence of structurally ordered defects in very high concentration (38% of the silicon atoms). As a result, ITQ&#8208;70 exhibits the lowest framework density (10.0 T/1000&#197;3) ever reported for any zeolite except RWY (7.6 T/1000&#197;3), which contains sulfur instead of oxygen connecting T&#8208;atoms.</dc:description>

         <title>CO Oxidation Catalyzed by Perovskites: The Role of Crystallographic Distortions Highlighted by Systematic Experiments and Artificial Intelligence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The identification of key materials&#8217; parameters correlated with the performance can accelerate the development of heterogeneous catalysts and unveil the relevant underlying physical processes. However, the analysis of correlations is often hindered by inconsistent data. Besides, nontrivial, yet unknown relationships may be important, and the intricacy of the various processes may be significant. Here, we tackle these challenges for the CO oxidation catalyzed by perovskites using a combination of rigorous experiments and artificial intelligence. A series of 13 ABO3 (A = La, Pr, Nd, Sm; B = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co) perovskites was synthesized, characterized, and tested in catalysis. To the resulting dataset, we applied the symbolic&#8208;regression SISSO approach. We identified an analytical expression correlated with the activity that contains the normalized unit&#8208;cell volume, the Pauling electronegativity of the elements A and B, and the ionization energy of the element B. Therefore, the activity is described by crystallographic distortions and by the chemical nature of A and B elements. The generalizability of the identified descriptor is confirmed by the good quality of the predictions for 3 additional ABO3 and of 16 chemically more complex AMn(1&#8208;x)B&#8217;xO3 (A = La, Pr, Nd; B&#8217; = Fe, Co Ni Cu, Zn) perovskites.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Electrocatalysis for the Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Heteroarylation of Indoles, Pyrroles, and Furans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidative cross&#8208;dehydrogenative C&#8208;H/C&#8208;H functionalizations represent an exemplary approach for synthesizing carbonyl compounds via &#945;&#8208;heteroarylation. Here we present the development of a direct anodic oxidative coupling process between 2&#8208;acylimidazoles and divergent heterocyclic systems including indole, pyrrole, and furan, facilitated by ferrocene&#8208;assisted asymmetric nickel electrocatalysis with high levels of enantioselectivity. Mechanistic investigations indicate that the reaction initially involves the formation of a chiral Ni&#8208;bound &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radical, which is then captured by the heteroarene radical cation via intermolecular stereoselective radical/radical cation coupling. The mild, scalable, and robust reaction conditions allow for a broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance, enabling access to a wide range of chiral hetero&#8208;compounds. The consequential &#945;&#8208;heteroaromatic carbonyl products can potentially be transformed into a plethora of synthetically valuable frameworks, as exemplified by their application in the asymmetric total synthesis of (&#8208;)&#8208;COX&#8208;2 inhibitor, (+)&#8208;acremoauxin A, and (+)&#8208;pemedolac.</dc:description>

         <title>Structures of a DNA Polymerase Caught while Incorporating Responsive Dual&#8208;Functional Nucleotide Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functionalizing nucleic acids using DNA polymerases is essential in biophysical and biotechnology applications. This study focuses on understanding how DNA polymerases recognize and incorporate nucleotides with diverse chemical modifications, aiming to develop advanced nucleotide probes. We present the crystal structures of ternary complexes of Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase (KlenTaq) with C5&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;modified environment&#8208;sensitive 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;triphosphate (dUTP) probes. These nucleotides include SedUTP, BFdUTP and FBFdUTP, which bear selenophene, benzofuran and fluorobenzofuran, respectively, at the C5 position of uracil, and exhibit high conformational sensitivity. SedUTP and FBFdUTP serve as dual&#8208;app probes, combining a fluorophore with X&#8208;ray anomalous scattering Se or 19F NMR labels. Our study reveals that the size of the heterocycle influences how DNA polymerase families A and B incorporate these modified nucleotides during single nucleotide incorporation and primer extension reactions. Remarkably, FBFdUTP's responsiveness enabled real&#8208;time monitoring of the binary complex formation and polymerase activity through fluorescence and 19F NMR. Comparative analysis of incorporation profiles, fluorescence, 19F NMR data, and crystal structures of ternary complexes highlights the enzyme's plasticity. Key insights are provided into the role of gatekeeper amino acids (Arg660 and Arg587) in accommodating and processing these modified substrates, offering a structural basis for next&#8208;generation nucleotide probe development.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrrolizwilline, a unique bacterial alkaloid assembled by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase and non&#8208;enzymatic dimerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are a structurally diverse group of heterocyclic specialized metabolites characterized by a core structure comprising a hexahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrolizine. PAs are synthesized through two main pathways. In plants, assembly occurs via a homospermidine synthase, and in bacteria, through combined action of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase and a Baeyer&#8208;Villiger monooxygenase. While the toxic properties of plant&#8208;derived PAs and their prevalence in animal and human foods have been extensively studied, the biological roles and biosynthesis of more complex bacterial PAs are not well understood. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a bacterial biosynthetic gene cluster from&#160;Xenorhabdus hominickii,&#160;xhpA&#8208;G, which is responsible for producing the PA pseudo&#8208;dimer pyrrolizwilline. Analysis of&#160;X. hominickii&#160;promoter exchange mutants together with heterologous expression of&#160;xhpA&#8208;G&#160;in&#160;E. coli, revealed a set of pathway intermediates, two of which were chemically synthesized, as well as multiple derivatives. This information was leveraged to propose a detailed biosynthetic pathway to pyrrolizwilline. Furthermore, we have characterized the hydrolase XhpG, the key enzyme in the conversion of the pathway intermediate pyrrolizixenamide to pyrrolizwilline, using X&#8208;ray crystallography and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS).</dc:description>

         <title>Second Generation Zwitterionic Aza&#8208;Diarylethene: Photoreversible CN Bond Formation, Three&#8208;State Photoswitching, Thermal Energy Release, and Facile Photoinitiation of Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diarylethenes are a well&#8208;studied and optimized class of photoswitches with a wide range of applications, including data storage, smart materials, or photocontrolled catalysis and biological processes. Most recently, aza&#8208;diarylethenes have been developed in which carbon&#8208;carbon bond connections are replaced by carbon&#8208;nitrogen connections. This structural elaboration opens an entire new structure and property space expanding versatility and applicability of diarylethenes. In this work, we present the second generation of zwitterionic aza&#8208;diarylethenes, which finally allows for fully reversible photoswitching and precise control over all three switching states. High&#8208;yielding photoswitching between the neutral open form and a zwitterionic&#160;Z&#160;isomer is achieved with two different wavelengths of light. The third zwitterionic&#160;E&#160;isomeric state can be reached up to 87% upon irradiation with a third wavelength. Its high energy content of &gt;10 kcal/mol can be released thermally by deliberate solvent change as trigger mechanism, rendering aza&#8208;diarylethenes into interesting candidates for molecular solar thermal energy&#160;storage (MOST) applications. The third state further serves as locking state, allowing to toggle light&#8208;responsiveness reversibly between thermally labile and thermally stable switching. Further, irradiation of the zwitterionic states leads to highly efficient photopolymerization of methyl acrylate (MA),&#160;directly harnessing the unleashed chemical reactivity of aza&#8208;diarylethene in materials applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of slide&#8208;ring polymers based on pillar[5]arene/alkyl chain host&#8722;guest interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Slide&#8208;ring polymers exhibit distinctive mechanical properties, making them highly promising for applications in emerging fields such as energy storage devices and smart sensing. However, existing slide&#8208;ring polymer systems primarily rely on hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic interactions to achieve ring&#8208;axle interlocking in aqueous phases. This reliance limits the construction of slide&#8208;ring networks mainly to water&#8208;soluble polymers, excluding a diverse range of lipophilic polymers. Therefore, it is crucial to introduce efficient construction strategies that facilitate interpenetration in organic solvents, enabling the development of diverse slide&#8208;ring polymers and expanding their range and applications. Herein, by utilizing the pillar[5]arene/alkyl chain host&#8722;guest interactions, we successfully facilitated the interpenetration of a pillar[5]arene and poly(caprolactone), enabling the efficient construction of two slide&#8208;ring polymer networks in organic solvents. One of these two slide&#8208;ring polymers demonstrates a unique network deformation mechanism along with outstanding mechanical properties compared with the control covalently cross&#8208;linked polymer network, including maximum stress (4.43 vs 1.98 MPa), maximum strain (1285 vs 330%), and toughness (35.4 vs 3.92 MJ/m3). More importantly, this strategy of making slide&#8208;ring polymers is highly versatile, given the wide range of macrocyclic arenes and alkyl chain&#8208;containing polymers it can accommodate.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational Modulation of Efficient Macrocyclic Emitters Featuring Delayed Fluorescence by Conjugation Length and Cavity Dimensions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocyclic emitters with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristics have attracted widespread attention in the field of organic electroluminescence (EL) materials due to their unique geometries and excellent luminescence performance. Despite the significant impact of conjugation length and cavity dimensions on molecular conformation, the influence of these factors on the excited&#8208;state properties remains understudied. Herein, we formulated a strategy aimed at modulating the conformation of TADF macrocyclic molecules containing aniline as the donor (D) unit, and triazine as the acceptor (A), linked in D&#8208;A and D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A alternative macrocyclic construction (MC&#8208;TNT and MC&#8208;TST). Corroborated by experimental and theoretical analyses, the compact and conformationally twisted MC&#8208;TNT exhibits efficient blue luminescence in crystalline state, facilitating EL at high doping concentrations with maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 13.9%, leading the field of blue macrocyclic emitters. Notably, MC&#8208;TST with &#960;&#8208;bridge and flat conformation, demonstrates diminished Coulombic repulsion, achieving nearly 100% photoluminescence quantum yield and superior horizontal dipole orientation of 85% in 5 wt% doped &#64257;lms, and the corresponding device's EQEmax reaches record&#8208;high 32.7% within the TADF macrocyclic domain.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed [3+2] annulation of Aromatic Amides with Olefins via Iminium Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the preliminary success of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] annulation of amides with olefins, the corresponding radical&#8208;type [3+2] annulation remains a laborious challenge. Herein we report the first photoredox&#8208;catalyzed radical&#8208;type [3+2] annulation of aromatic amides with olefins. We established an approach to generate unprecedented iminium radicals by reducing the oxyiminium intermediates, formed in situ from corresponding amides with Tf2O, via photoredox catalysis. The [3+2] annulation was achieved via stepwise radical process, instead of forming linear products via other pathways as previously reported. This annulation protocol exhibits excellent functional group tolerance, and a diversity of substrates are united under the photoredox conditions, affording iminium products that can be in situ diversified into 1&#8208;indanones, enamines and amines. Mechanistic investigations indicate reduction of the oxyiminium intermediate to the iminium radicals by excited&#8208;state of the photocatalyst initiates the catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Electrosynthesis of Valuable para&#8208;Benzoquinone from Aqueous Phenol on NiRu Hybrid Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic oxidation of aqueous phenol to para&#8208;benzoquinone (p&#8208;BQ) offers a sustainable approach for both pollutant abatement and value&#8208;added chemicals production. However, achieving high phenol conversion and p&#8208;BQ yield under neutral conditions remains challenging. Herein, we report a Ni(OH)2&#8208;supported Ru nanoparticles (NiRu) hybrid electrocatalyst, which exhibits a superior phenol conversion of 96.5% and an excellent p&#8208;BQ yield of 83.4% at pH 7.0, significantly outperforming previously reported electrocatalysts. This exceptional performance benefits from the triple synergistic modulation of the NiRu catalyst, including enhanced phenol adsorption, increased p&#8208;BQ desorption, and suppressed oxygen evolution. By coupling a flow electrolyzer with an extraction&#8208;distillation separation unit, the simultaneous phenol removal and p&#8208;BQ recovery are realized. Additionally, the developed electrocatalytic system with the NiRu/C anode displays good stability, favorable energy consumption, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions for phenol&#8208;containing wastewater treatment, demonstrating its potential for practical applications. This work offers a promising strategy for achieving low&#8208;carbon emissions in phenol wastewater treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Orientational Compatibility Modulation of Ligands in Low&#8208;Symmetry Multi&#8208;Cavity Discrete Coordination Cages by Neighbouring Cage Participation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Complexation of Pd(II) with a designer unsymmetrical bis&#8208;monodentate ligand (2:4 ratio) yielded a specific Pd2L4 type &#8220;single&#8208;cavity discrete coordination cage&#8221; (SCDCC), from a pool of 4 isomeric structures. The observed selctivity is attributed to inherent orientational preference of the ligand strands around the metal centers. Crafting a short coordinating arm at either ends of the bis&#8208;monodentate ligand (i.e the longer&#8208;arm) produced a pair of unsymmetrical isomeric tris&#8208;monodentate ligands; whereas crafting the same short&#8208;arm at both ends of the ligand gives an unsymmetrical tetrakis&#8208;monodentate ligand. Complexation of Pd(II) with either of the isomeric tris&#8208;monodenate ligands (3:4 ratio) resulted in corresponding low&#8208;symmetry &#8220;multi&#8208;cavity discrete coordination cage&#8221; MCDCC having two conjoined cavities, though the inherent relative orientational preference of the longer arms is not achievable in these cages. The enforced orientation is sustained by &#8220;Neighbouring Cage Participation&#8221; (NCP). However, one&#8208;pot combination of Pd(II), with a mixture of isomeric tris&#8208;monodenate ligands in 3:2:2 ratio produced an integratively self&#8208;sorted mixed&#8208;ligated MCDCC from a pool of 31 structures. Also, mixing Pd(II) with the tetrakis&#8208;monodentate ligand produced a MCDCC having three conjoined cavities. The inherent orientational preference of longer&#8208;arm of the ligand strands is retained in the mixed&#8208;ligated double&#8208;cavity and the homo&#8208;ligated triple cavity cages.</dc:description>

         <title>Synchronous Modulation of H&#8208;bond Interaction and Steric Hindrance via Bio&#8208;molecular Additive Screening in Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In addressing challenges such as side reaction and dendrite formation, electrolyte modification with bio&#8208;molecule sugar species has emerged as a promising avenue for Zn anode stabilization. Nevertheless, considering the structural variability of sugar, a comprehensive screening strategy is meaningful yet remains elusive. Herein, we report the usage of sugar additives as a representative of bio&#8208;molecules to develop a screening descriptor based on the modulation of the hydrogen bond component and electron transfer kinetics. It is found that xylo&#8208;oligosaccharide (Xos) with the highest H&#8208;bond acceptor ratio enables efficient water binding, affording stable Zn/electrolyte interphase to alleviate hydrogen evolution. Meanwhile, sluggish reduction originated from the steric hindrance of Xos contributes to optimized Zn deposition. With such a selected additive in hand, the Zn||ZnVO full cells demonstrate durable operation. This study is anticipated to provide a rational guidance in sugar additive selection for aqueous Zn batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation and Deactivation of Chirality Transfer in the Superbundles of Sequence&#8208;defined Stereoisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Discrete oligomers can be used to precisely evaluate the structure&#8208;property relationship and enable unique chiroptical activities, however, the role of stereochemical sequences in chirality transfer is still unclear. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of a series of sequence&#8208;defined chiral azobenzene (Azo) oligomers via iterative stepwise chain growth strategy, and the discovery of controllable activation and deactivation of chirality transfer. Sequence&#8208;defined stereoisomers with one single chiral (L or D) stereocenter at the &#945;&#8208;position, &#969;&#8208;position and middle&#8208; (m&#8208;) position have completely different self&#8208;assembly dynamics and chirality transfer mechanisms. &#969;&#8208;positional stereocenter can effectively command all Azo building blocks to adopt a tilted &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking along the helical superbundles, exhibiting the activation of chirality transfer. However, discrete oligomers with the stereocenter at other positions can only self&#8208;assemble into non&#8208;helical nanowires, accompanied by the deactivation of chirality transfer. Kinetic experiments as well as chemical simulations indicate that the cooperative supramolecular interaction, including the &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction between repeated Azo units, the intermolecular hydrogen bonding and steric hindrance, are intrinsic driving forces for these differentiations. This study has shed light on the unique self&#8208;assembled kinetics in stereosequential oligomers and the mechanism of chirality induction at hierarchical levels.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoparticle Transport in Proximal Tubules with Rhabdomyolysis&#8208;induced Necrosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Renal&#8208;clearable engineered nanoparticles are being explored for their potential to deliver therapeutic agents for kidney disease treatment. A fundamental understanding of how these nanoparticles accumulate in diseased kidneys at the cellular level is essential to enhance their effectiveness and minimize side effects on adjacent healthy tissues. Herein, we report that the accumulation of glutathione&#8208;coated, near&#8208;infrared emitting gold nanoparticles (GS&#8208;AuNPs) correlates strongly with the necrotic stages of injured proximal tubular cells. Using a rhabdomyolysis&#8208;induced acute kidney injury (AKI) mouse model, we observed that GS&#8208;AuNPs were significantly accumulated in the extracellular lumen of proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) at advanced necrotic stage, where cellular debris and released intracellular contents impeded their clearance. In contrast, during early necrosis, GS&#8208;AuNPs were still cleared through the open lumen. Additionally, intracellular uptake of GS&#8208;AuNPs was significantly reduced across all necrotic stages. These findings underscore the need for new strategies to design nanoparticles that can effectively target and be taken up by the diseased tubular cells before extensive necrosis occurs; so that nanoparticle&#8208;mediated drug delivery for kidney disease treatment can be achieved with desired efficacy and precision.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxenoid reactivity enabled by targeted photoactivation of periodate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemistry of low&#8208;valent intermediates continues to inspire new modes of reactivity across synthetic chemistry. But while the generation and reactivity of both carbenes and nitrenes are well&#8208;established, difficulties in accessing oxene, their oxygen&#8208;based congener, has severely hampered its application in synthesis. Here, we report a conceptually novel approach to oxene generation through the violet&#8208;light photolysis of tetrabutylammonium periodate. By revealing an unexpected geometric change upon periodate photoexcitation that facilitates intersystem crossing, we have exploited the near&#8208;barrierless dissociation of triplet periodate into oxene. Under these operationally simple conditions, we have demonstrated the epoxidation of a wide range of substituted olefins, revealing unprecedented functional group compatibility. By overcoming the historic challenges associated with employing oxene as an intermediate in organic chemistry, we believe that this platform will inspire the development of new reactive oxygen&#8208;based methodologies across industry and academia.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Ion Co&#8208;insertion Induced Spontaneous and Reversible Phase Conversion Chemistry for Unprecedented Zn2+ Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prussian blue analogues are highly promising electrode materials due to their versatile electrochemical activity and low cost. However, they often suffer from severe structural damage caused by the Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion and dissolution of high&#8208;spin outer metal ions, resulting in poor cycle life. Material modification and electrolyte regulation have been the common approaches to address this issue, albeit with very limited success. We report here a novel and efficient strategy to preserve structural stability by co&#8208;inserting Co2+ and Zn2+ ions in KCo[Fe(CN)6]. This co&#8208;insertion induced a spontaneous and reversible phase conversion by the replacement of low&#8208;spin inner ion (Fe3+), which efficiently relieves structural damage caused by Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion and metal&#8208;ion dissolution, leading to an outstanding Zn2+ storage capacity and an exceptional improvement of cycle life with a capacity retention of 97.7% over 4400 cycles at 40 C. We also demonstrated the enhancement of co&#8208;intercalation on ion migration using a combined approach of experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work provides an important progress to solve the cycle stability of Prussian blue analogues towards their practical application as electrode materials for aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Reactive Oxygen Species Generation via Contact&#8208;Electro&#8208;Catalysis with FeIII&#8208;Initiated Self&#8208;cycled Fenton System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an FeIII&#8208;initiated self&#8208;cycling Fenton system (SF&#8208;CEC), where the synergistic effects of O2 activation and FeIII&#8208;activated H2O2 further enhance 1O2 generation. In this SF&#8208;CEC system, reactive oxygen species (ROS) can degrade protonated azo dyes by nearly 99&#8201;% within 10&#8197;minutes.







Abstract
Contact Electro&#8208;Catalysis (CEC) using commercial dielectric materials in contact&#8208;separation cycles with water can trigger interfacial electron transfer and induce the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the inherent hydrophobicity of commercial dielectric materials limits the effective reaction sites, and the generated ROS inevitably undergo self&#8208;combination to form hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In typical CEC systems, H2O2 does not further decompose into ROS, leading to suboptimal reaction rates. Addressing the generation and activation of H2O2 is therefore crucial for advancing CEC. Here, we synthesized a catalyst by loading the dielectric material polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) onto ZSM&#8208;5 (PTFE/ZSM&#8208;5, PZ for short), achieving uniform dispersion of the catalyst in water for the first time. The introduction of an FeIII&#8208;initiated self&#8208;cycling Fenton system (SF&#8208;CEC), with the synergistic effects of O2 activation and FeIII&#8208;activated H2O2, further enhanced ROS generation. In the FeIII&#8208;initiated SF&#8208;CEC system, the synergistic effects of ROS and protonated azo dyes enabled nearly 99&#8201;% degradation of azo dyes within 10&#8197;minutes, a sixfold improvement compared to the CEC system. This represents the fastest degradation rate of methyl orange dye induced by ultrasound to date. Without extra oxidants, this system enabled stable dissolution of precious metals in weakly acidic solutions at room temperature, achieving 80&#8201;% gold dissolution within 2&#8197;hours, 2.5&#8197;times faster than similar CEC systems. This study also corrects the unfavorable perception of CEC applications under acidic conditions, providing new insights for the fields of dye degradation and precious metal recovery.

         <title>One&#8208;Stone&#8208;For&#8208;Three&#8208;Birds Strategy Using a Fullerene Modifier for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fullerene derivative (denoted as C60&#8208;TMA) is synthesized and employed to modify the interface between perovskite and C60. C60&#8208;TMA can passivate the surface defects to suppress non&#8208;radiative recombination, form a cascade energy level to facilitate electron extraction, and induce secondary growth of perovskite, contributing to a champion PCE of 24.89&#8201;% for inverted PSCs with significantly improved thermal stability.







Abstract
The electron extraction from perovskite/C60 interface plays a crucial role in influencing the photovoltaic performance of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we develop a one&#8208;stone&#8208;for&#8208;three&#8208;birds strategy via employing a novel fullerene derivative bearing triple methyl acrylate groups (denoted as C60&#8208;TMA) as a multifunctional interfacial layer to optimize electron extraction at the perovskite/C60 interface. It is found that the C60&#8208;TMA not only passivates surface defects of perovskite via coordination interactions between C=O groups and Pb2+ cations but also bridge electron transfer between perovskite and C60. Moreover, it effectively induces the secondary grain growth of the perovskite film through strong bonding effect, and this phenomenon has never been observed in prior art reports on fullerene related studies. The combination of the above three upgrades enables improved perovskite film quality with increased grain size and enhanced crystallinity. With these advantages, C60&#8208;TMA treated PSC devices exhibit a much higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.89&#8201;% than the control devices (23.66&#8201;%). Besides, C60&#8208;TMA benefits improved thermal stability of PSC devices, retaining over 90&#8201;% of its initial efficiency after aging at 85&#8201;&#176;C for 1200&#8197;h, primarily due to the reinforced interfacial interactions and improved perovskite film quality.

         <title>P&#8208;doped RuSe2 on Porous N&#8208;Doped Carbon Matrix as Catalysts for Accelerated Sulfur Redox Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new catalyst of phosphorus doped RuSe2 (P&#8208;RuSe2) with&#160;the enhanced conductivity and the modulation of the d&#8208;band center is engineered via a rational screening strategy, which augments its effectiveness in interacting with LiPSs and hence exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance in terms of high capacity, superior rate capability and stable cycle life.







Abstract
Monocomponent catalysts exhibit the limited catalytic conversion of polysulfides due to their intrinsic electronic structure, but their catalytic activity can be improved by introducing heteroatoms to regulate its electronic structure. However, the rational selection principles of doping elements remain unclear. Here, we are guided by theoretical calculations to select the suitable doping elements based on the balanced relationship between the adsorption strength of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and catalytic activity of lithium sulfide. We apply the screening method to develop a new catalyst of phosphorus doped RuSe2, manifesting the further enhanced conductivity compared with original RuSe2, facilitating charge transfer and further modulating the d&#8208;band center of RuSe2, thereby augmenting its effectiveness in interacting with LiPSs. Consequently, the assembled cell exhibits an areal capacity of 7.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, even under high sulfur loading of 8.0&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a lean electrolyte condition (5.0&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1). This rational screening strategy offers a robust solution for the design of advanced catalysts in the field of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries and potentially other domains as well.
