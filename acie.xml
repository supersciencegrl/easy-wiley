         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Triggered Photoswitching of Diphosphene Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photochemically and thermally reversible photoisomerization of &#951;2&#8208; to &#951;1&#8208;diphosphene complexes is described. The origins of this remarkable photochromic behavior lie in the S1 excited state, as elucidated by theoretical studies. The findings underscore the potential of previously overlooked transition metal diphosphene complexes, revealing their promising photochromic properties and distinctive photoswitching behavior.







Abstract
Although diphosphene transition metal complexes are known to undergo E to Z isomerization upon irradiation with UV light, their potential for photoswitching has remained poorly explored. In this study, we present diphosphene complexes capable of reversible photoisomerizations through haptotropic rearrangements. The compounds [(2&#8208;&#954;2P,&#954;6C)Mo(CO)2][OTf] (3&#8201;a[OTf]), [(2&#8208;&#954;2P,&#954;6C)Fe(CO)][OTf] (3&#8201;b[OTf]), and [(2&#8208;&#954;2P)Fe(CO)4][OTf] (4[OTf]) were prepared using the triflate salt [(LC)P=P(Dipp)][OTf] (2[OTf) as a precursor (LC=4,5&#8208;dichloro&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisiopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;yl; Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisiopropylphenyl, OTf=triflate). Upon exposure to blue or UV light (&#955;=400&#8197;nm, 470&#8197;nm), the initially red&#8208;colored &#951;2&#8208;diphosphene complexes 3&#8201;a,b[OTf] readily undergo isomerization to form blue&#8208;colored &#951;1&#8208;complexes [(2&#8208;&#954;1P,&#954;6C)M(CO)n][OTf] (5&#8201;a,b[OTf]; a: M=Mo, n=2; b: M=Fe, n=1). This haptotropic rearrangement is reversible, and the (&#954;2P,&#954;6C)&#8208;coordination mode gradually reverts back upon dissolution in coordinating solvents or more rapidly upon exposure to yellow or red irradiation (&#955;=590&#8197;nm, 630&#8197;nm). The electronic reasons for the reversible visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photoswitching observed for 3&#8201;a,b[OTf] are elucidated by DFT calculations. These calculations indicate that the photochromic isomerization originates from the S1 excited state and proceeds through a conical intersection.

         <title>Pyrazine&#8208;linked Iron&#8208;coordinated Tetrapyrrole Conjugated Organic Polymer Catalyst with Spatially Proximate Donor&#8208;Acceptor Pairs for Oxygen Reduction in Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatially proximate electron donor&#8208;acceptor pairs are integrated into conjugated organic polymers, which enables fine tailoring of iron&#8208;coordinated tetrapyrrole (FePr) active sites at the molecular level. The innovative catalyst endows FePr sites with a covalently bonded matrix, strong d&#8208;&#960; electron coupling and a highly dense distribution, leading to unprecedented performance in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;coordinated iron (Fe&#8722;N4) materials represent the most promising non&#8208;noble electrocatalysts for the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of fuel cells. However, molecular&#8208;level structure design of Fe&#8722;N4 electrocatalyst remains a great challenge. In this study, we develop a novel Fe&#8722;N4 conjugated organic polymer (COP) electrocatalyst, which allows for precise design of the Fe&#8722;N4 structure, leading to unprecedented ORR performance. At the molecular level, we have successfully organized spatially proximate iron&#8208;pyrrole/pyrazine (FePr/Pz) pairs into fully conjugated polymer networks, which in turn endows FePr sites with firmly covalent&#8208;bonded matrix, strong d&#8208;&#960; electron coupling and highly dense distribution. The resulting pyrazine&#8208;linked iron&#8208;coordinated tetrapyrrole (Pz&#8722;FeTPr) COP electrocatalyst exhibits superior performance compared to most ORR electrocatalysts, with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.933 V and negligible activity decay after 40,000&#8197;cycles. When used as the cathode electrocatalyst in a hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cell, the Pz&#8722;FeTPr COP achieves a peak power density of &#8776;210&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. We anticipate the COP based Fe&#8722;N4 catalyst design could be an effective strategy to develop high&#8208;performance catalyst for facilitating the progress of fuel cells.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Small Air&#8208;Stable Triplet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation Upconversion Nanoparticles for Anti&#8208;Stokes Time&#8208;Resolved Imaging</title>

         <dc:description>
A new class of ultra&#8208;small nanoparticle (NP) probes based on triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) chromophores in an organic&#8211;inorganic ureasil host have been prepared and used to stain living cells as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of TTA&#8208;UC lifetime imaging for the first time. Fluctuations of the UC lifetime in the stained cells indicate the NPs can be used to map local oxygen diffusion across the subcellular structure.







Abstract
Image contrast is often limited by background autofluorescence in steady&#8208;state bioimaging microscopy. Upconversion bioimaging can overcome this by shifting the emission lifetime and wavelength beyond the autofluorescence window. Here we demonstrate the first example of triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) based lifetime imaging microscopy. A new class of ultra&#8208;small nanoparticle (NP) probes based on TTA&#8208;UC chromophores encapsulated in an organic&#8211;inorganic host has been synthesised. The NPs exhibit bright UC emission (400&#8211;500&#8197;nm) in aerated aqueous media with a UC lifetime of &#8776;1&#8197;&#956;s, excellent colloidal stability and little cytotoxicity. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of TTA&#8208;UC lifetime imaging using these NPs shows that the long&#8208;lived anti&#8208;Stokes emission is easily discriminable from typical autofluorescence. Moreover, fluctuations in the UC lifetime can be used to map local oxygen diffusion across the subcellular structure. Our TTA&#8208;UC NPs are highly promising stains for lifetime imaging microscopy, affording excellent image contrast and potential for oxygen mapping that is ripe for further exploitation.

         <title>Imaging of Single Molecular Behaviors Under Bifurcated Three&#8208;Centered Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic visualization of single thiophene probes was performed to recognize single framework Al T&#8208;sites with atomic resolution, and reveal the bifurcated three&#8208;centered hydrogen bonding behaviors of single thiophenes at confined acid T&#8208;sites in zeolites.







Abstract
The mechanism for interaction and bonding of single guest molecules with active sites fundamentally determines the sorption and subsequent catalytic processes occurring in host zeolitic frameworks. However, no real&#8208;space studies on these significant issues have been reported thus far, since atomically visualizing guest molecules and recognizing single Al T&#8208;sites in zeolites remain challenging. Here, we atomically resolved single thiophene probes interacting with acid T&#8208;sites in the ZSM&#8208;5 framework to study the bonding behaviors between them. The synergy of bifurcated three&#8208;centered hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions can &#8220;freeze&#8221; the near&#8208;horizontal thiophene and make it stable enough to be imaged. By combining the imaging results with simulations, direct atomic observations enabled us to precisely locate the single Al T&#8208;sites in individual straight channels. Then, we statistically found that the thiophene bonding probability of the T11 site is 15&#8197;times higher than that of the T6 site. For different acid T&#8208;sites, the variation in the interaction synergy changes the inner angle of the host&#8211;guest O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S hydrogen bond, thereby affecting the stability of the near&#8208;horizontal thiophene and leading to considerable bonding inhomogeneities.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Based Artificial Organelle Corrects Microenvironment Interference for Accurate Intratumoral Glucose Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spatially compartmentalized artificial organelle is reported by immobilizing enzymes within porous coordination polymers. The acid&#8208;digested bi&#8208;enzyme cascade core shows boosted catalytic efficiency for sensitive signal transduction, while the stable shell integrating catalase not only overcomes the interference in signal output but also alleviates the hypoxic state to maximize glucose oxidation, enabling accurate intratumoral metabolite analysis.







Abstract
Enzymatic catalysis with high efficiency allows them a great prospect in metabolite monitoring in living cells. However, complex tumor microenvironments, such as acidity, H2O2, and hypoxia, are bound to disturb catalytic reactions for misleading results. Here, we report a spatially compartmentalized artificial organelle to correct intratumoral glucose analysis, where the zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 immobilized glucose oxidase&#8208;horseradish peroxidase cascade core and catalase&#8208;directed shell act as signal transduction and guarding rooms respectively. The acid&#8208;digested core and stable shell provide appropriate spaces to boost biocatalytic efficiency with good tolerability. Notably, the endogenous H2O2 is in situ decomposed to O2 by catalase, which not only overcomes the interference in signal output but also alleviates the hypoxic states to maximize glucose oxidation. The marked protective effect and biocompatibility render artificial organelles to correct the signal transduction for dynamic monitoring glucose in vitro and in vivo, achieving our goal of accurate intratumoral metabolite analysis.

         <title>Living Alternating Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Copolymerization of 2,3&#8208;Dihydrofuran to Provide Completely Degradable Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the DHF copolymers with enhanced alternating ratios and degradability. By carefully tuning the ROMP reactivities of comonomers and Ru initiators, we achieved an outstanding A, B&#8208;alternation (up to 98&#8201;%), while preserving the benefits of living polymerization. The superior degradability of our copolymers was also demonstrated by the notable NMR yield of the unimeric degradation products (up to 80&#8201;%) and recovery ratio (66&#8201;% yield).







Abstract
2,3&#8208;Dihydrofuran (DHF) has recently been gaining significant attention as a comonomer in metathesis polymerization, thanks to its ability to provide the resultant polymer backbones with stimuli&#8208;responsive degradability. In this report, we present living alternating copolymerization of DHF with less reactive endo&#8208;tricyclo[4.2.2.02,5]deca&#8208;3,9&#8208;dienes (TDs) and endo&#8208;oxonorbornenes (oxoNBs). By carefully controlling the reactivity of both the Ru initiators and the monomers, we have achieved outstanding A, B&#8208;alternation (up to 98&#8201;%) under near stoichiometric DHF loading conditions. Notably, we have also found that the use of a more sterically hindered Ru initiator helps to attain polymer backbones with higher DHF incorporation and superior&#8197;A, B&#8208;alternation. While preserving the living characteristics of DHF copolymerization, as evidenced by controlled molecular weights (up to 73.9&#8197;kDa), narrow dispersities (down to 1.05), and block copolymer formation, our DHF copolymers could be broken down to a single repeat unit level under acidic conditions. 1H&#8197;NMR analysis of the model copolymer revealed that after 24&#8197;hours of degradation, up to 80&#8201;% of the initial polymer was transformed into a single small molecule product, and after purification, up to 66&#8201;% of the degradation product was retrieved. This study provides a versatile approach to improve the alternation and degradability of DHF copolymers.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Initiated Dispersion Photopolymerization of Styrene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Styrene can be photopolymerized in dispersion using visible light and an optimized photo&#8208;initiating system, overcoming light scattering by the growing objects. Stable latexes with particle diameters up to 1.2&#8197;&#956;m were obtained using poly(N&#8208;vinylpyrrolidone) as stabilizer. This represents a fourfold increase in the largest particle size ever reached by a photochemical process in a dispersed medium.







Abstract
Polystyrene (PS) particles were synthesized in ethanol/water mixture by dispersion polymerization using visible light irradiation, with either a N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene borane&#8208;based photoinitiating system (PIS) or a disulfide. With the full PIS and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA) as stabilizer, the size distributions were broad and the amount of PEGMA had a strong impact on the experiment reproducibility. The addition of a base solved the problem, leading to faster polymerizations, narrower size distributions and larger particles. With the disulfide as sole PIS, bigger and narrowly distributed PS particles were again formed. Quantitative conversion was achieved in each system, with particle size ranging between 100 and 350&#8197;nm. The use of poly(N&#8208;vinylpyrrolidone) as stabilizer led to significantly larger particles, up to 1.2&#8197;&#956;m, with narrow size distributions. The production of such large latex particles by photoinitiated polymerizations is unprecedented.

         <title>Giant Crystalline Molecular Rotors that Operate in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we have described the first example of crystalline materials in which bulky iptycene derivatives (triptycene and pentiptycene) exhibit rotational dynamics in the solid state. It is revealed that encapsulation by a large concave NHC ligand provides reasonable rotational space around the central rotator. This platform will enable further design of systems in which large and complicated molecular units exhibit rotational motion in solid.







Abstract
Molecular motion in the solid state is typically precluded by the highly dense environment, and only molecules with a limited range of sizes show such dynamics. Here, we demonstrate the solid&#8208;state rotational motion of two giant molecules, i.e., triptycene and pentiptycene, by encapsulating a bulky N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) Au(I) complex in the crystalline media. To date, triptycene is the largest molecule (surface area: 245&#8197;&#197;2; volume: 219&#8197;&#197;3) for which rotation has been reported in the solid state, with the largest rotational diameter among reported solid&#8208;state molecular rotors (9.5&#8197;&#197;). However, the pentiptycene rotator that is the subject of this study (surface area: 392&#8197;&#197;2; volume: 361&#8197;&#197;3; rotational diameter: 13.0&#8197;&#197;) surpasses this record. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses of both the developed rotors revealed that these possess sufficient free volume around the rotator. The molecular motion in the solid state was confirmed using variable&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state 2H spin&#8208;echo NMR studies. The triptycene rotor exhibited three&#8208;fold rotation, while temperature&#8208;dependent changes of the rotational angle were observed for the pentiptycene rotor.

Here, we demonstrate the solid-state rotational motion of two giant molecules, i.e., triptycene and pentiptycene, by encapsulating a bulky N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) Au(I) complex in the crystalline media. To date, triptycene is the largest molecule (surface area: 245&#8197;&#197;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; volume: 219&#8197;&#197;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) for which rotation has been reported in the solid state, with the largest rotational diameter among reported solid-state molecular rotors (9.5&#8197;&#197;). However, the pentiptycene rotator that is the subject of this study (surface area: 392&#8197;&#197;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; volume: 361&#8197;&#197;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;; rotational diameter: 13.0&#8197;&#197;) surpasses this record. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses of both the developed rotors revealed that these possess sufficient free volume around the rotator. The molecular motion in the solid state was confirmed using variable-temperature solid-state &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H spin-echo NMR studies. The triptycene rotor exhibited three-fold rotation, while temperature-dependent changes of the rotational angle were observed for the pentiptycene rotor.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Merging Visible Light Photocatalysis and P(III)&#8208;Directed C&#8722;H Activation by a Single Catalyst: Modular Assembly of P&#8208;Alkyne Hybrid Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H alkynylation of biaryl monophosphines has been successfully accomplished with exceptional efficacy and remarkable functional group tolerance. Importantly, this transformation was achieved without the need for external photosensitizers, by synergistically combining visible light photoredox catalysis and P(III)&#8208;directed C&#8722;H activation under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation strategies provide an efficient approach for synthesis by minimizing atom, step, and redox economy. Developing milder, greener, and more effective protocols for these strategies is always highly desirable to the scientific community. In this study, the utilization of a single rhodium complex enabled the visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H activation of biaryl&#8208;type phosphines with alkynyl bromides, employing inherent phosphorus atoms as directing groups. This chemistry combines P(III)&#8208;directed C&#8722;H activation with visible light photocatalysis, under exogenous photosensitizer&#8208;free conditions, offering a unique platform for ligand design and preparation. Furthermore, this study also explores the asymmetric catalysis and coordination chemistry of the resulting P&#8208;alkyne hybrid ligands with specific transition metals. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations demonstrate the mechanistic intricacies of this transformation.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Sialyl Lewisa Antigen and the Effective Anticancer Activity of Its Bacteriophage Q&#946; Conjugate as an Anticancer Vaccine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sialyl Lewisa is an attractive carbohydrate&#8208;associated cancer antigen. To develop an effective sialyl Lewisa based vaccine, the stereoselective synthesis of sialyl Lewisa tetrasaccharide was accomplished. The glycan was covalently conjugated with a powerful carrier, bacteriophage Q&#946;, which induced higher levels of and persistent anti&#8208;sialyl Lewisa IgG antibody responses, thus providing significant tumor protection in a metastatic cancer model in mice.







Abstract
Sialyl Lewisa (sLea), also known as cancer antigen 19&#8208;9 (CA19&#8208;9), is a tumor&#8208;associated carbohydrate antigen. The overexpression of sLea on the surface of a variety of cancer cells makes it an attractive target for anticancer immunotherapy. However, sLea&#8208;based anticancer vaccines have been under&#8208;explored. To develop a new vaccine, efficient stereoselective synthesis of sLea with an amine&#8208;bearing linker was achieved, which was subsequently conjugated with a powerful carrier bacteriophage, Q&#946;. Mouse immunization with the Q&#946;&#8208;sLea conjugate generated strong and long&#8208;lasting anti&#8208;sLea IgG antibody responses, which were superior to those induced by the corresponding conjugate of sLea with the benchmark carrier keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Antibodies elicited by Q&#946;&#8208;sLea were highly selective toward the sLea structure, could bind strongly with sLea&#8208;expressing cancer cells and human pancreatic cancer tissues, and kill tumor cells through complement&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity. Furthermore, vaccination with Q&#946;&#8208;sLea significantly reduced tumor development in a metastatic cancer model in mice, demonstrating tumor protection for the first time by a sLea&#8208;based vaccine, thus highlighting the significant potential of sLea as a promising cancer antigen.

         <title>2D Plasmonic Molecules via Hydrogen Bond Interaction between Polymer&#8208;Grafted Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of highly symmetric 2D plasmonic molecules were assembled through hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction between a pair of polymer&#8208;capped gold nanoparticles (donor and acceptor). Polymer interaction and solvation were found to compete with each other during the colloidal self&#8208;assembly process, which can be used to precisely control the coordination number. The nanostructures rearrange themselves from 3D to 2D when being cast onto a substrate.







Abstract
The use of macromolecular design features to regulate non&#8208;covalent bonding on the nanoscale is a young and emerging fabrication strategy for advanced nanostructures. For the first time, we describe a self&#8208;assembly method to create a series of 2D plasmonic molecules (PMs) using hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction between a pair of polymer&#8208;capped gold nanoparticles (hydrogen&#8208;bond donor and acceptor). Due to the nature of hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction, we found that polymer interaction and solvation compete with each other during the self&#8208;assembly process, which turns out to be the most important condition for controlling the coordination number of PMs. We have conducted an extensive study on the solvent effect, which has helped us to design and fabricate a series of precise PMs with high symmetry.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Memory Effect Enabled by Ligand Substitution and CO2 Affinity in a Flexible SIFSIX Coordination Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linker engineering of a flexible SiF62&#8722; (SIFSIX) pillared network via single atom substitution profoundly changes the sorption behavior and affords a kinetically stable shape&#8208;memory material. The &#8216;memorized&#8217; open phase efficiently purifies a CO2/N2 (15/85) mixture in a manner which would be infeasible for the nonporous variant.







Abstract
We report that linker ligand substitution involving just one atom induces a shape&#8208;memory effect in a flexible coordination network. Specifically, whereas SIFSIX&#8208;23&#8208;Cu, [Cu(SiF6)(L)2]n, (L=1,4&#8208;bis(1&#8208;imidazolyl)benzene, SiF62&#8722;=SIFSIX) has been previously reported to exhibit reversible switching between closed and open phases, the activated phase of SIFSIX&#8208;23&#8208;CuN, [Cu(SiF6)(LN)2]n (LN=2,5&#8208;bis(1&#8208;imidazolyl)pyridine), transformed to a kinetically stable porous phase with strong affinity for CO2. As&#8208;synthesized SIFSIX&#8208;23&#8208;CuN, &#945;, transformed to less open, &#947;, and closed, &#946;, phases during activation. &#946; did not adsorb N2 (77&#8197;K), rather it reverted to &#945; induced by CO2 at 195, 273 and 298&#8197;K. CO2 desorption resulted in &#945;&#8242;, a shape&#8208;memory phase which subsequently exhibited type&#8208;I isotherms for N2 (77&#8197;K) and CO2 as well as strong performance for separation of CO2/N2 (15/85) at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar driven by strong binding (Qst=45&#8211;51&#8197;kJ/mol) and excellent CO2/N2 selectivity (up to 700). Interestingly, &#945;&#8242; reverted to &#946; after re&#8208;solvation/desolvation. Molecular simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide insight into the properties of SIFSIX&#8208;23&#8208;CuN.

Interestingly, &#945;&#8242; reverted to &#946; after re-solvation/desolvation. Molecular simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide insight into the properties of SIFSIX-23-Cu&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Precise Recognition in Water by an Endo&#8208;Functionalized Cavity: Tuning the Complementarity of Binding Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Endo&#8208;functionalized hosts with different rigid skeletons were successfully synthesized. The well&#8208;controlled distances of the recognition sites within the hydrophobic cavities enable the highly selective recognition of structurally similar guests. This approach presents a viable solution for achieving the precise recognition of specific guests in aqueous environments through adjustments in the distance of recognition sites.







Abstract
Precise binding towards structurally similar substrates is a common feature of biomolecular recognition. However, achieving such selectivity&#8212;especially in distinguishing subtle differences in substrates&#8212;with synthetic hosts can be quite challenging. Herein, we report a novel design strategy involving the combination of different rigid skeletons to adjust the distance between recognition sites within the cavity, which allows for the highly selective recognition of hydrogen&#8208;bonding complementary substrates, such as 4&#8208;chromanone. X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structures and density functional theory calculations confirmed that the distance of endo&#8208;functionalized groups within the rigid cavity is crucial for achieving high binding selectivity through hydrogen bonding. The thermodynamic data and molecular dynamics simulations revealed a significant influence of the hydrophobic cavity on the binding affinity. The new receptor possesses both high selectivity and high affinity, which provide valuable insights for the design of customized receptors.

         <title>Deciphering the Role of the Ser&#8208;Phosphorylation Pattern on the DNA&#8208;Binding Activity of Max Transcription Factor Using Chemical Protein Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of Max transcription factor variants with distinct modifications was prepared by a practical strategy to probe the impact of Ser phosphorylation. The phosphorylation pattern was found to play a crucial role in DNA&#8208;binding activity but did not significant affect sequence specificity. The insight gained on the regulatory role of Max phosphorylation sheds light on how post&#8208;translational modifications influence transcription factor activity.







Abstract
The chemical synthesis of site&#8208;specifically modified transcription factors (TFs) is a powerful method to investigate how post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) influence TF&#8208;DNA interactions and impact gene expression. Among these TFs, Max plays a pivotal role in controlling the expression of 15&#8201;% of the genome. The activity of Max is regulated by PTMs; Ser&#8208;phosphorylation at the N&#8208;terminus is considered one of the key regulatory mechanisms. In this study, we developed a practical synthetic strategy to prepare homogeneous full&#8208;length Max for the first time, to explore the impact of Max phosphorylation. We prepared a focused library of eight Max variants, with distinct modification patterns, including mono&#8208;phosphorylated, and doubly phosphorylated analogues at Ser2/Ser11 as well as fluorescently labeled variants through native chemical ligation. Through comprehensive DNA binding analyses, we discovered that the phosphorylation position plays a crucial role in the DNA&#8208;binding activity of Max. Furthermore, in vitro high&#8208;throughput analysis using DNA microarrays revealed that the N&#8208;terminus phosphorylation pattern does not interfere with the DNA sequence specificity of Max. Our work provides insights into the regulatory role of Max&#8242;s phosphorylation on the DNA interactions and sequence specificity, shedding light on how PTMs influence TF function.

         <title>An Aqueous Redox Flow Battery Using CO2 as an Active Material with a Homogeneous Ir Catalyst
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an aqueous redox flow battery (RFB) system using CO2 as an active material with a homogeneous Ir catalyst. The RFB exhibited a maximum discharge capacity of 10.5&#8197;mAh (1.5&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&#8722;1), capacity decay of 0.2&#8201;% per cycle, and total turnover number of 2550 after 50 cycles. Furthermore, in situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analysis using an on&#8208;line setup showed the high valence state of IrIV worked as active species.







Abstract
For the application of CO2 as an energy storage material, a H2 storage system has been proposed based on the interconversion of CO2 and formic acid (or formate). However, energy losses are inevitable in the conversion of electrical energy to H2 as chemical energy (&#8776;70&#8201;% electrical efficiency) and H2 to electrical energy (&#8776;40&#8201;% electrical efficiency). To overcome these significant energy losses, we developed a system based on the interconversion of CO2 and formate for the direct storage and generation of electricity. In this paper, we report an aqueous redox flow battery system using homogeneous Ir catalysts with CO2&#8208;formate redox pair. The system exhibited a maximum discharge capacity of 10.5&#8197;mAh (1.5&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&#8722;1), capacity decay of 0.2&#8201;% per cycle, and total turnover number of 2550 after 50 cycles. During charging&#8208;discharging, in situ fluorescence X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy based on an online setup indicated that the active species was in a high valence state of IrIV.

         <title>Highly Recyclable and Tough Elastic Vitrimers from a Defined Polydimethylsiloxane Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a novel network design principle for ultra&#8208;tough and highly recyclable elastic vitrimers, and a series of physical analysis is performed to provide a deep structure&#8208;property understanding for the excellent performance of the defined&#8208;network vitrimers.







Abstract
Despite intensive research on sustainable elastomers, achieving elastic vitrimers with significantly improved mechanical properties and recyclability remains a scientific challenge. Herein, inspired by the classical elasticity theory, we present a design principle for ultra&#8208;tough and highly recyclable elastic vitrimers with a defined network constructed by chemically crosslinking the pre&#8208;synthesized disulfide&#8208;containing polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) chains with tetra&#8208;arm polyethylene glycol (PEG). The defined network is achieved by the reduced dangling short chains and the relatively uniform molecular weight of network strands. Such elastic vitrimers with the defined network, i.e., PDMS&#8208;disulfide&#8208;D, exhibit significantly improved mechanical performance than random analogous, previously reported PDMS vitrimers, and even commercial silicone&#8208;based thermosets. Moreover, unlike the vitrimers with random network that show obvious loss in mechanical properties after recycling, those with the defined network enable excellent thermal recyclability. The PDMS&#8208;disulfide&#8208;D also deliver comparable electrochemical signals if utilized as substrates for electromyography sensors after the recycling. The multiple relaxation processes are revealed via a unique physical approach. Multiple techniques are also applied to unravel the microscopic mechanism of the excellent mechanical performance and recyclability of such defined network.

         <title>Activity And Stability of Single&#8208; And Di&#8208;Atom Catalysts for the O2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A computational screening method to identify single&#8208; and di&#8208;atom catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction with metal dopants from first&#8208;row transition elements supported on defect&#8208;containing nitrogenated graphene surfaces is presented. We have performed a three&#8208;step screening study to explore the structural stability, catalytic activity, and electrochemical stability of the catalysts using first&#8208;principles simulations.







Abstract
Efficient and inexpensive catalysts for the O2 reduction reaction (ORR) are needed for the advancement of renewable energy technologies. In this study, we designed a computational catalyst&#8208;screening method to identify single and di&#8208;atom metal dopants from first&#8208;row transition elements supported on defect&#8208;containing nitrogenated graphene surfaces for the ORR. Based on formation&#8208;energy calculations and micro&#8208;kinetic modelling of reaction pathways using intermediate binding free energies, we have identified four potentially interesting single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) and fifteen di&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) with relatively high estimated catalytic activity at 0.8&#8197;V vs RHE. Among the best SACs, MnNC shows high stability in both acidic and alkaline media according to our model. For the DACs, we found four possible candidates, MnMn, FeFe, CoCo, and MnNi doped on quad&#8208;atom vacancy sites having considerable stability over a wide pH range. The remaining SACs and DACs with high activity are either less stable or show a stability region at an alkaline pH.

         <title>Discovery of a Potent Deubiquitinase (DUB) Small&#8208;Molecule Activity&#8208;Based Probe Enables Broad Spectrum DUB Activity Profiling in Living Cells

IMP&#8208;2373 is the first activity&#8208;based probe (ABP) that captures the activity of a large portion of the &#8220;DUBome&#8221; across multiple deubiquitinase (DUB) sub&#8208;classes with limited off&#8208;target effects in living cells, providing a complementary tool to ubiquitin ABPs, which function only in lysates. IMP&#8208;2373 enables researchers to profile DUB inhibitors target engagement and selectivity in cells, and to understand DUB activity in disease&#8208;relevant systems.







Abstract
Deubiquitinases (DUBs) are a family of &gt;100 proteases that hydrolyze isopeptide bonds linking ubiquitin to protein substrates, often leading to reduced substrate degradation through the ubiquitin proteasome system. Deregulation of DUB activity has been implicated in many diseases, including cancer, neurodegeneration and auto&#8208;inflammation, and several have been recognized as attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. Ubiquitin&#8208;derived covalent activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs) provide a powerful tool for DUB activity profiling, but their large recognition element impedes cellular permeability and presents an unmet need for small molecule ABPs which can account for regulation of DUB activity in intact cells or organisms. Here, through comprehensive chemoproteomic warhead profiling, we identify cyanopyrrolidine (CNPy) probe IMP&#8208;2373 (12) as a small molecule pan&#8208;DUB ABP to monitor DUB activity in physiologically relevant live cells. Through proteomics and targeted assays, we demonstrate that IMP&#8208;2373 quantitatively engages more than 35&#8197;DUBs across a range of non&#8208;toxic concentrations in diverse cell lines. We further demonstrate its application to quantification of changes in intracellular DUB activity during pharmacological inhibition and during MYC deregulation in a model of B cell lymphoma. IMP&#8208;2373 thus offers a complementary tool to ubiquitin ABPs to monitor dynamic DUB activity in the context of disease&#8208;relevant phenotypes.

         <title>Is &#8220;Water in Salt&#8221; Electrolytes the Ultimate Solution? Achieving High Stability of Organic Anodes in Diluted Electrolyte Solutions Via a Wise Anions Selection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
While the use of highly concentrated electrolytes has become a popular approach to stabilize electrodes in aqueous environments, we demonstrated in this paper that diluted electrolytes can also be effectively used. By appropriate selection of chaotropic anions, we show that the performance of PTCDA electrodes can be substantially improved and excellent stability maintained even at extremely diluted solutions.







Abstract
The introduction of the water&#8208;in&#8208;salt (WIS) electrolytes concept to prevent water splitting and widen the electrochemical stability window, has spurred extensive research efforts toward development of improved aqueous batteries. The successful implementation of these electrolyte solutions in many electrochemical systems shifts the focus from diluted to WIS electrolyte solutions. Considering the high costs and the tendency of these nearly saturated solutions to crystallize, this trend can be carefully re&#8208;evaluated. Herein we show that the stability of organic electrodes comprising the active material perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA), is strongly influenced by the solvation character of the anions rather than the concentration of the electrolyte solution. Even though the charging process of PTCDA involves solely insertion of cations (i.e., principal counter&#8208;ions), surprisingly, the dominant factor influencing its electrochemical performance, including long&#8208;term electrode stability, is the type of the co&#8208;ions (i.e., electrolytic anions). Using systematic electrochemical analysis combined with theoretical simulations, we show that the selection of kosmotropic anions results in fast fading of the PTCDA anodes, while a selection of chaotropic anions leads to excellent stability, even at electrolytes concentrations as low as 0.2&#8197;M. These findings provide a new conceptual approach for designing advanced electrolyte solutions for aqueous batteries.

         <dc:description>
An unprecedented three&#8208;component reaction building on palladium&#8208;catalyzed aminoalkylative cyclization between an aminoenyne, an aldehyde and a boronic acid or diphenylsilane is developed. This provides a facile access to multisubstituted exocyclic 1,3&#8208;dienes bearing 5 to 8&#8208;membered saturated N&#8208;heterocycles in a regioselective and stereodivergent fashion.







Abstract
A novel and efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed regioselective and stereodivergent ring&#8208;closing reaction of aminoenynes with aldehydes and boronic acids or hydrosilane is developed. This three&#8208;component reaction allows for the modular synthesis of a series of exocyclic 1,3&#8208;dienes bearing 5&#8208; to 8&#8208;membered saturated N&#8208;heterocycles. The reactions utilize a simple Pd&#8208;catalyst and work with broad range of aminoenynes, aldehydes and organometallic reagents under mild reaction conditions. The products represent useful intermediates for chemical synthesis due to the versatility of the conjugated diene. Preliminary mechanistic details of the method are also revealed.

         <title>Structures, Bonding Analyses and Reactivity of a Dicationic Digallene and Diindene Mimicking trans&#8208;bent Ditetrylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolation of group 13 compounds featuring the first cationic, trans&#8208;bent double bonded digallene and diindene with the bisdicyclohexylphosphinoethane ligand is reported. Their bonding situations are extensively analyzed by quantum chemical calculations and compared to that in isoelectronic, neutral digermenes and distannenes. Several oxidative addition reactions to the digallene were studied.







Abstract
The reaction of bisdicyclohexylphosphinoethane (dcpe) and the subvalent MI sources [MI(PhF)2][pf] (M=Ga+, In+; [pf]&#8722;=[Al(ORF)4]&#8722;; RF=C(CF3)3) yielded the salts [{M(dcpe)}2][pf]2, containing the first dicationic, trans&#8208;bent digallene and diindene structures reported so far. The non&#8208;classical MI&#8646;MI double bonds are surprisingly short and display a ditetrylene&#8208;like structure. The bonding situation was extensively analyzed by quantum chemical calculations, QTAIM (Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules) and EDA&#8208;NOCV (Energy Decomposition Analysis with the combination of Natural Orbitals for Chemical Valence) analyses and is compared to that in the isoelectronic and isostructural, but neutral digermenes and distannenes. The dissolved [{Ga(dcpe)}2]2+([pf]&#8722;)2 readily reacts with 1&#8208;hexene, cyclooctyne, diphenyldisulfide, diphenylphosphine and under mild conditions at room temperature. This reactivity is analyzed and rationalized.

&lt;p&gt;The reaction of &lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;dicyclohexylphosphinoethane (dcpe) and the subvalent M&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; sources [M&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;(PhF)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;][&lt;i&gt;pf&lt;/i&gt;] (M=Ga&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, In&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;; [&lt;i&gt;pf&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;=[Al(OR&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;; R&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;=C(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) yielded the salts [{M(dcpe)}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;][&lt;i&gt;pf&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, containing the first dicationic, &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-bent digallene and diindene structures reported so far. The non-classical M&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&#8646;M&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; double bonds are surprisingly short and display a ditetrylene-like structure. The bonding situation was extensively analyzed by quantum chemical calculations, QTAIM (Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules) and EDA-NOCV (Energy Decomposition Analysis with the combination of Natural Orbitals for Chemical Valence) analyses and is compared to that in the isoelectronic and isostructural, but neutral digermenes and distannenes. The dissolved [{Ga(dcpe)}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;([&lt;i&gt;pf&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; readily reacts with 1-hexene, cyclooctyne, diphenyldisulfide, diphenylphosphine and under mild conditions at room temperature. This reactivity is analyzed and rationalized.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Delocalized Isoelectronic Heterostructured FeCoOxSy Catalysts with Tunable Electron Density for Accelerated Sulfur Redox Kinetics in Li&#8208;S batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The delocalized isoelectronic heterojunction catalyst (DIHC) is constructed by substituting isoelectronic S for O to further complement the heterojunction theory. With the formation of the more catalytic sites in the DIHC, the catalytic behaviors at the heterojunction interface are regulated to realize the continuous capture&#8212;adsorption&#8212;catalysis of Li2Sn, thus improving the sulfur reaction kinetics and performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
High interconversion energy barriers, depressive reaction kinetics of sulfur species, and sluggish Li+ transport inhibit the wide development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries. Herein, differing from random mixture of selected catalysts, the composite catalyst with outer delocalized isoelectronic heterostructure (DIHC) is proposed and optimized, enhancing the catalytic efficiency for decreasing related energy barriers. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;content, the FeCoOxSy composites with different degrees of sulfurization are fabricated by regulating atoms ratio between O and S. The relationship of catalytic efficiency and principal mechanism in DIHCs are deeply understood from electrochemical experiments to in situ/operando spectral spectroscopies i.e., Raman, XRD and UV/Vis. Consequently, the polysulfide conversion and Li2S precipitation/dissolution experiments strongly demonstrate the volcano&#8208;like catalytic efficiency of various DIHCs. Furthermore, the FeCoOxSy&#8208;decorated cell delivers the high performance (1413&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). Under the low electrolyte/sulfur ratio, the high loading cell stabilizes the areal capacity of 6.67&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Impressively, even resting for about 17&#8197;days for possible polysulfide shuttling, the high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading FeCoOxSy&#8208;decorated cell stabilizes the same capacity, showing the practical application of the DIHCs in improving catalytic efficiency and reaching high electrochemical performance.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Plasmon Resonance Coupling Promoting Directional Photosynthesis of Nitrate from Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual&#8208;plasmon coupling structure (Bi/CsxWO3) generates a localized electromagnetic field enhancement to improve the formation efficiency and delay the self&#8208;thermalization of energetic hot carriers, which facilitates the directional overall&#8208;utilization of photoexcited electrons and holes, thereby boosting the activation of inert nitrogen molecules into nitrates under mild conditions.







Abstract
Photocatalysis, particularly plasmon&#8208;mediated photocatalysis, offers a green and sustainable approach for direct nitrogen oxidation into nitrate under ambient conditions. However, the unsatisfactory photocatalytic efficiency caused by the limited localized electromagnetic field enhancement and short hot carrier lifetime of traditional plasmonic catalysts is a stumbling block to the large&#8208;scale application of plasmon photocatalytic technology. Herein, we design and demonstrate the dual&#8208;plasmonic heterojunction (Bi/CsxWO3) achieves efficient and selective photocatalytic N2 oxidation. The yield of NO3&#8722; over Bi/CsxWO3 (694.32&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) are 2.4&#8197;times that over CsxWO3 (292.12&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) under full&#8208;spectrum irradiation. The surface dual&#8208;plasmon resonance coupling effect generates a surge of localized electromagnetic field intensity to boost the formation efficiency and delay the self&#8208;thermalization of energetic hot carriers. Ultimately, electrons participate in the formation of &#8901;O2&#8722;, while holes involve in the generation of &#8901;OH and the activation of N2. The synergistic effect of multiple reactive oxygen species drives the direct photosynthesis of NO3&#8722;, which achieves the overall&#8208;utilization of photoexcited electrons and holes in photocatalytic reaction. The concept that the dual&#8208;plasmon resonance coupling effect facilitates the directional overall&#8208;utilization of photoexcited carriers will pave a new way for the rational design of efficient photocatalytic systems.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Rate Na/Cl2 Batteries Through Improved Electron and Ion Transport by Heteroatom&#8208;Doped Bicontinuous&#8208;Structured Carbon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rechargeable Na/Cl2 battery with an ultrahigh rate capability (16,000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1) has been realized using a bicontinuous&#8208;structured carbon cubosome with heteroatomic doping, which enables efficient Na+ and electron transport and promoted Cl2 adsorption and conversion. It provides a new paradigm to solve the dilemma between energy density and power density in energy storage devices.







Abstract
Rechargeable sodium/chlorine (Na/Cl2) batteries are emerging candidates for sustainable energy storage owing to their superior energy densities and the high abundance of Na and Cl elements. However, their practical applications have been plagued by the poor rate performance (e.g., a maximum discharge current density of 150&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1), as the widely used carbon nanosphere cathodes show both sluggish electron&#8208;ion transport and reaction kinetics. Here, by mimicking the sufficient mass and energy transport in a sponge, we report a bicontinuous&#8208;structured carbon cubosome with heteroatomic doping, which allows efficient Na+ and electron transport and promotes Cl2 adsorption and conversion, thus unlocking ultrahigh&#8208;rate Na/Cl2 batteries, e.g., a maximum discharge current density of 16,000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 that is more than two orders of magnitude higher than previous reports. The optimized solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;gas (carbon&#8211;electrolyte&#8211;Cl2) triple interfaces further contribute to a maximum reversible capacity and cycle life of 2,000&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 250&#8197;cycles, respectively. This study establishes a universal approach for improving the sluggish kinetics of conversion&#8208;type battery reactions, and provides a new paradigm to resolve the long&#8208;standing dilemma between high energy and power densities in energy storage devices.

We propose an environmentally&#8208;friendly route for the synthesis of crystalline covalent organic frameworks (COFs) from CO2 molecules as a precursor. Two&#8208;step reactions using NaBH4, piperazine and melamine with CO2 provided high crystalline structure. The CO2&#8208;derived COF has a 3&#8208;fold interpenetrated structure showing a BET surface area of 945&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and structural integrity. This structure transforms to high proton conductor upon post&#8208;modification reaction with Oxone.







Abstract
Crystalline triazine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are aromatic nitrogen&#8208;rich porous materials. COFs typically show high thermal/chemical stability, and are promising for energy applications, but often require harsh synthesis conditions and suffer from low crystallinity. In this work, we propose an environmentally friendly route for the synthesis of crystalline COFs from CO2 molecules as a precursor. The mass ratio of CO2 conversion into COFs formula unit reaches 46.3&#8201;%. The synthesis consists of two steps; preparation of 1,4&#8208;piperazinedicarboxaldehyde from CO2 and piperazine, and condensation of the dicarboxaldehyde and melamine to construct the framework. The CO2&#8208;derived COF has a 3&#8208;fold interpenetrated structure of 2D layers determined by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, and select&#8208;area electron diffraction. The structure shows a high Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller surface area of 945&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and high stability against strong acid (6&#8197;M HCl), base (6&#8197;M NaOH), and boiling water over 24&#8197;hours. Post&#8208;modification of the framework with oxone has been demonstrated to modulate hydrophilicity, and it exhibits proton conductivity of 2.5&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 85&#8201;&#176;C, 95&#8201;% of relative humidity.

         <title>Super&#8208;fast Charging Biohybrid Batteries through a Power&#8208;to&#8208;formate&#8208;to&#8208;bioelectricity Process by Combining Microbial Electrochemistry and CO2 Electrolysis</title>

By combining the cutting&#8208;edge advancements in microbial electrochemistry and CO2 electrolysis, a revolutionary biohybrid battery is developed. This biohybrid battery stands out for its remarkable super&#8208;fast charging and long&#8208;duration discharging capabilities. Moreover, the recovered bioelectricity from this battery can be utilized to assess water biotoxicity.







Abstract
Extensive study on renewable energy storage has been sparked by the growing worries regarding global warming. In this study, incorporating the latest advancements in microbial electrochemistry and electrochemical CO2 reduction, a super&#8208;fast charging biohybrid battery was introduced by using pure formic acid as an energy carrier. CO2 electrolyser with a slim&#8208;catholyte layer and a solid electrolyte layer was built, which made it possible to use affordable anion exchange membranes and electrocatalysts that are readily accessible. The biohybrid battery only required a 3&#8208;minute charging to accomplish an astounding 25&#8208;hour discharging phase. In the power&#8208;to&#8208;formate&#8208;to&#8208;bioelectricity process, bioconversion played a vital role in restricting both the overall Faradaic efficiency and Energy efficiency. The CO2 electrolyser was able to operate continuously for an impressive total duration of 164&#8197;hours under Gas Stand&#8208;By model, by storing N2 gas in the extraction chamber during stand&#8208;by periods. Additionally, the electric signal generated during the discharging phase was utilized for monitoring water biotoxicity. Functional genes related to formate metabolism were identified in the bioanode and electrochemically active bacteria were discovered. On the other hand, Paracoccus was predominantly found in the used air cathode. These results advance our current knowledge of exploiting biohybrid technology.

         <title>Promoted Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution by Tuning the Electronic State of Copper Sites in Metal&#8208;Organic Supramolecular Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two metal&#8208;organic supramolecular assemblies based on &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking were synthesized as heterogeneous noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution. Without changing the coordination environments or the supramolecular structures, the spin and charge density of the Cu sites were tuned by modulating terminal ligands, resulting in an increased rate of photocatalytic hydrogen production.







Abstract
The electronic state in terms of charge and spin of metal sites is fundamental to govern the catalytic activity of a photocatalyst. Herein, we show that modulation of the electronic states of Cu sites, without changing the coordination environments, of two metal&#8208;organic supramolecular assemblies based on &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking can significantly improve photocatalytic activity. The use of these heterogeneous photocatalysts, without using noble metal cocatalysts, resulted in an increase of the hydrogen production rate from 522 to 3620&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1. A systematical analysis revealed that the charge density and spin density of the metal centers are efficiently modulated via the modulation of the coordination fields around active copper (II) centers by the variation of the non&#8208;coordination groups of terminal ligands, leading to the significant enhancement of photocatalytic activity. This work provides an insight into the electronic state of active metal centers for designing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts.

         <title>Correlating the Solvating Power of Solvents with the Strength of Ion&#8208;Dipole Interaction in Electrolytes of Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvating power describes the strength of ion&#8208;dipole interaction, which is not necessarily related to the coordination number. The solvation structure originates from the competition between ion&#8208;ion interaction and ion&#8208;dipole interaction. With the similar strength of ion&#8208;ion and ion&#8208;dipole interactions, more anions enter the solvation sheath and form a stable electrode interface.







Abstract
The solvation structure of Li+ plays a significant role in determining the physicochemical properties of electrolytes. However, to date, there is still no clear definition of the solvating power of different electrolyte solvents, and even the solvents that preferentially participate in the solvation structure remain controversial. In this study, we comprehensively discuss the solvating power and solvation process of Li+ ions using both experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations. Our findings reveal that the solvating power is dependent on the strength of the Li+&#8208;solvent (ion&#8208;dipole) interaction. Additionally, we uncover that the anions tend to enter the solvation sheath in most electrolyte systems through Li+&#8208;anion (ion&#8208;ion) interaction, which is weakened by the shielding effect of solvents. The competition between the Li+&#8208;solvent and Li+&#8208;anion interactions ultimately determines the final solvation structures. This insight into the fundamental understanding of the solvation structure of Li+ provides inspiration for the design of multifunctional mixed&#8208;solvent electrolytes for advanced batteries.

         <title>Efficient Catalytic Production of Hydrogen Peroxide Using Tin&#8208;containing Zeolite Fixed Palladium Nanoparticles with Oxidation Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Pd nanoparticles were fixed in the SnOx&#8208;containing zeolite, exhibiting superior performance in directly producing hydrogen peroxide rather than water from hydrogen and oxygen, with the productivity of hydrogen peroxide at &#8776;10,170&#8197;mmol gPd&#8722;1 h&#8722;1.







Abstract
The metal surfaces tend to be oxidized in air through dissociation of the O&#8722;O bond of oxygen to reduce the performances in various fields. Although several ligand modification routes have alleviated the oxidation of bulky metal surfaces, it is still a challenge for the oxidation resistance of small&#8208;size metal nanoparticles. Herein, we fixed the small&#8208;size Pd nanoparticles in tin&#8208;contained MFI zeolite crystals, where the tin acts as an electron donor to efficiently hinder the oxidation of Pd by weakening the adsorption of molecular oxygen and suppressing the O&#8722;O cleavage. This oxidation&#8208;resistant Pd catalyst exhibited superior performance in directly synthesizing hydrogen peroxide from hydrogen and oxygen, with the productivity of hydrogen peroxide at &#8776;10,170&#8197;mmol gPd&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, steadily outperforming the catalysts tested previously. This work leads to the hypothesis that tin is an electron donor to realize oxidation&#8208;resistant Pd within zeolite crystals for efficient catalysis to overcome the limitation of generally supported Pd catalysts and further motivates the use of oxidation&#8208;resistant metal nanoparticles in various fields.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The metal surfaces tend to be oxidized in air through dissociation of the O&#8722;O bond of oxygen to reduce the performances in various fields. Although several ligand modification routes have alleviated the oxidation of bulky metal surfaces, it is still a challenge for the oxidation resistance of small-size metal nanoparticles. Herein, we fixed the small-size Pd nanoparticles in tin-contained MFI zeolite crystals, where the tin acts as an electron donor to efficiently hinder the oxidation of Pd by weakening the adsorption of molecular oxygen and suppressing the O&#8722;O cleavage. This oxidation-resistant Pd catalyst exhibited superior performance in directly synthesizing hydrogen peroxide from hydrogen and oxygen, with the productivity of hydrogen peroxide at &#8776;10,170&#8197;mmol g&lt;sub&gt;Pd&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, steadily outperforming the catalysts tested previously. This work leads to the hypothesis that tin is an electron donor to realize oxidation-resistant Pd within zeolite crystals for efficient catalysis to overcome the limitation of generally supported Pd catalysts and further motivates the use of oxidation-resistant metal nanoparticles in various fields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inorganic&#8211;Organic Hybrid Multifunctional Solid Electrolyte Interphase Layers for Dendrite&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated multifunctional Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) layer with inorganic/organic hybrid construction can effectively reinforce sodium metal anodes (SMAs). The synergistic collaboration between inorganic and organic components in SEI leverages their respective strengths, contributing to dendrite&#8208;free SMAs and prolonging the lifespan of sodium metal batteries.







Abstract
Constructing a stable and robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial for achieving dendrite&#8208;free sodium metal anodes and high&#8208;performance sodium batteries. However, maintaining the integrity of SEI during prolonged cycle life under high current densities poses a significant challenge. In this study, we propose an integrated multifunctional SEI layer with inorganic/organic hybrid construction (IOHL&#8722;Na) to enhance the durability of sodium metal anode during reduplicative plating/stripping processes. The inorganic components with high mechanical strength and strong sodiophilicity demonstrate optimized ionic conduction efficiency and dendrite inhibition ability. Simultaneously, the organic component contributes to the formation of a dense and elastic membrane structure, preventing fracture and delamination issues during volume fluctuations. The symmetrical batteries of IOHL&#8722;Na achieve stable cycling over 2000&#8197;hours with an extremely low voltage hysteresis of around 15.8&#8197;mV at a high current density of 4&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the Na&#8722;O2 batteries sustain exceptional long&#8208;term stability and impressive capacity retention, exploiting a promising approach for constructing durable SEI and dendrite&#8208;free sodium metal anodes.

         <title>Structure and Function of the &#945;&#8208;Hydroxylation Bimodule of the Mupirocin Polyketide Synthase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mupirocin is a clinically important polyketide antibiotic bearing a 6&#8208;hydroxy group that is essential for biological activity. NMR spectroscopy, authentic synthetic substrates and mass spectrometry were used to establish the mechanistic steps governing incorporation of this key 6&#8208;hydroxy group by an &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation bimodule that recruits a trans acting monooxygenase, MupA.







Abstract
Mupirocin is a clinically important antibiotic produced by a trans&#8208;AT Type I polyketide synthase (PKS) in Pseudomonas fluorescens. The major bioactive metabolite, pseudomonic acid A (PA&#8722;A), is assembled on a tetrasubstituted tetrahydropyran (THP) core incorporating a 6&#8208;hydroxy group proposed to be introduced by &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of the thioester of the acyl carrier protein (ACP) bound polyketide chain. Herein, we describe an in vitro approach combining purified enzyme components, chemical synthesis, isotopic labelling, mass spectrometry and NMR in conjunction with in vivo studies leading to the first characterisation of the &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation bimodule of the mupirocin biosynthetic pathway. These studies reveal the precise timing of hydroxylation by MupA, substrate specificity and the ACP dependency of the enzyme components that comprise this &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation bimodule. Furthermore, using purified enzyme, it is shown that the MmpA KS0 shows relaxed substrate specificity, suggesting precise spatiotemporal control of in trans MupA recruitment in the context of the PKS. Finally, the detection of multiple intermodular MupA/ACP interactions suggests these bimodules may integrate MupA into their assembly.

Possessing an extraordinarily congested heptacyclic skeleton, three lactone units, and nine consecutive stereocenters, (&#8722;)&#8208;cephalotanin B is a structurally unusual member of the Cephalotaxus diterpenoids, natural products with intriguing molecular frameworks and promising biological properties.

Abstract
Cephalotaxus diterpenoids are attractive natural products with intriguing molecular frameworks and promising biological features. As a structurally unusual member, (&#8722;)&#8208;cephalotanin B possesses an extraordinarily congested heptacyclic skeleton, three lactone units, and nine consecutive stereocenters. Herein, we report an enantioselective total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;cephalotanin B based on a divergent asymmetric Michael addition reaction, a novel Pauson&#8211;Khand/deacyloxylation process discovered in the development of a second&#8208;generation stereoselective Pauson&#8211;Khand reaction protocol, and an epoxide&#8208;opening/elimination/dual&#8208;lactonization cascade to construct the challenging propeller&#8208;shaped A&#8211;B&#8211;C ring system as key transformations.

         <title>A Protocol for Activated Bioorthogonal Fluorescence Labeling and Imaging of 4&#8208;Hydroxyphenylpyruvate Dioxygenase in Plants</title>

A protocol for activated bioorthogonal fluorescence labeling and imaging of 4&#8208;hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase in plants is developed.







Abstract
4&#8208;Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) plays a crucial role in the synthesis of nutrients needed to maintain optimal plant growth. Its level is closely linked to the extent of abiotic stress experienced by plants. Moreover, it is also the target of commercial herbicides. Therefore, labeling of HPPD in plants not only enables visualization of its tissue distribution and cellular uptake, it also facilitates assessment of abiotic stress of plants and provides information needed for the development of effective environmentally friendly herbicides. In this study, we created a method for fluorescence labeling of HPPD that avoids interference with the normal growth of plants. In this strategy, a perylene&#8208;linked dibenzyl&#8208;cyclooctyne undergoes strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition with an azide&#8208;containing HPPD ligand. The activation&#8208;based labeling process results in a significant emission enhancement caused by the change in the fluorescent forms from an excimer to a monomer. Notably, this activated bioorthogonal strategy is applicable to visualizing HPPD in Arabidopsis thaliana, and assessing its response to multiple abiotic stresses. Also, it can be employed to monitor in vivo levels and locations of HPPD in crops. Consequently, the labeling strategy will be a significant tool in investigations of HPPD&#8208;related abiotic stress mechanisms, discovering novel herbicides, and uncovering unknown biological functions.

         <title>Selective Encapsulation and Chiral Induction of C60 and C70 Fullerenes by Axially Chiral Porous Aromatic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
PAC&#8208;2 (Br substituted) instead of PAC&#8208;3 (CH3 substituted) exhibit fullerene encapsulation, and selective capture of C70 in various carbon soot. The induced chiroptical properties of C60 and C70 by R/S&#8208;PAC&#8208;2 is confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction and new mirror&#8208;symmetry CD signal within the absorption region of fullerenes.







Abstract
Chiral induction has been an important topic in chemistry, not only for its relevance in understanding the mysterious phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking in nature but also due to its critical implications in medicine and the chiral industry. The induced chirality of fullerenes by host&#8211;guest interactions has been rarely reported, mainly attributed to their chiral resistance from high symmetry and challenges in their accessibility. Herein, we report two new pairs of chiral porous aromatic cages (PAC), R&#8208;PAC&#8208;2, S&#8208;PAC&#8208;2 (with Br substituents) and R&#8208;PAC&#8208;3, S&#8208;PAC&#8208;3 (with CH3 substituents) enantiomers. PAC&#8208;2, rather than PAC&#8208;3, achieves fullerene encapsulation and selective binding of C70 over C60 in fullerene carbon soot. More significantly, the occurrence of chiral induction between R&#8208;PAC&#8208;2, S&#8208;PAC&#8208;2 and fullerenes is confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and the intense CD signal within the absorption region of fullerenes. DFT calculations reveal the contribution of electrostatic effects originating from face&#8208;to&#8208;face arene&#8208;fullerene interactions dominate C70 selectivity and elucidate the substituent effect on fullerene encapsulation. The disturbance from the differential interactions between fullerene and surrounding chiral cages on the intrinsic highly symmetric electronic structure of fullerene could be the primary reason accounting for the induced chirality of fullerene.

         <title>Exploiting the Catenane Mechanical Bond Effect for Selective Halide Anion Transmembrane Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catenanes have been shown to be capable of anion transport across a lipid bilayer. The catenanes convergently encapsulate Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722; via halogen and hydrogen bonding motifs, markedly enhancing the binding affinity and membrane transport efficiency for Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722; relative to constituent macrocycles. The catenanes also showed exceptional transport selectivity for chloride over OH&#8722; and oxoanion NO3&#8722;.







Abstract
The first examples of [2]catenanes capable of selective anion transport across a lipid bilayer are reported. The neutral halogen bonding (XB) [2]catenanes were prepared via a chloride template&#8208;directed strategy in an unprecedented demonstration of using XB&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;anion interactions to direct catenane assembly from all&#8208;neutral components. Anion binding experiments in aqueous&#8208;organic solvent media revealed strong halide over oxoanion selectivity, and a marked enhancement in the chloride and bromide affinities of the catenanes relative to their constituent macrocycles. The catenanes additionally displayed an anti&#8208;Hofmeister binding preference for bromide over the larger iodide anion, illustrating the efficacy of employing sigma&#8208;hole interactions in conjunction with the mechanical bond effect to tune receptor selectivity. Transmembrane anion transport studies conducted in POPC LUVs revealed that the catenanes were more effective anion transporters than the constituent macrocycles, with high chloride over hydroxide selectivity, which is critical to potential therapeutic applications of anionophores. Remarkably these outperform existing acyclic halogen bonding anionophores with regards to this selectivity. Record chloride over nitrate anion transport selectivity was also observed. This represents a rare example of the direct translation of intrinsic anion binding affinities to anion transport behaviour, and demonstrates the key role of the catenane mechanical bond effect for enhanced anion transport selectivity.

         <title>Sustained Hydrogen Spillover on Pt/Cu(111) Single&#8208;Atom Alloy: Dynamic Insights into Gas&#8208;Induced Chemical Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>

Collisions between H2 and adsorbed H atoms at the Pt site play a pivotal role in promoting hydrogen spillover, underscoring the importance of the interaction between gas molecules and adsorbates in elucidating chemical processes under a gas atmosphere.







Abstract
Hydrogen spillover, involving the surface migration of dissociated hydrogen atoms from active metal sites to the relatively inert catalyst support, plays a crucial role in hydrogen&#8208;involved catalytic processes. However, a comprehensive understanding of how H atoms are driven to spill over from active sites onto the catalyst support is still lacking. Here, we examine the atomic&#8208;scale perspective of the H spillover process on a Pt/Cu(111) single atom alloy surface using machine&#8208;learning accelerated molecular dynamics calculations based on density functional theory. Our results show that when an impinging H2 dissociates at an active Pt site, the Pt atom undergoes deactivation due to the dissociated hydrogen atoms that attach to it. Interestingly, collisions between H2 and sticking H atoms facilitate H spillover onto the host Cu, leading to the reactivation of the Pt atom and the realization of a continuous H spillover process. This work underscores the importance of the interaction between gas molecules and adsorbates as a driving force in elucidating chemical processes under a gaseous atmosphere, which has so far been underappreciated in thermodynamic studies.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Phomactin Platelet Activating Factor Antagonist Requires a Two&#8208;Enzyme Cascade</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of diverse phomactins in nature only requires two enzymes: a type I diterpene cyclase PhmA and a P450 monooxygenase PhmC. PhmA catalyzes the conversion of GGPP into phomactatriene, while PhmC, in a sequential manner, orchestrates the oxidation of multiple sites within phomactatriene. This finely coordinated enzymatic cascade ultimately results in the production of a fascinating array of structurally diverse phomactins.







Abstract
Phomactin diterpenoids possess a unique bicyclo[9.3.1]pentadecane skeleton with multiple oxidative modifications, and are good platelet&#8208;activating factor (PAF) antagonists that can inhibit PAF&#8208;induced platelet aggregation. In this study, we identified the gene cluster (phm) responsible for the biosynthesis of phomactins from a marine fungus, Phoma sp. ATCC 74077. Despite the complexity of their structures, phomactin biosynthesis only requires two enzymes: a type I diterpene cyclase PhmA and a P450 monooxygenase PhmC. PhmA was found to catalyze the formation of the phomactatriene, while PhmC sequentially catalyzes the oxidation of multiple sites, leading to the generation of structurally diverse phomactins. The rearrangement mechanism of the diterpene scaffold was investigated through isotope labeling experiments. Additionally, we obtained the crystal complex of PhmA with its substrate analogue FGGPP and elucidated the novel metal&#8208;ion&#8208;binding mode and enzymatic mechanism of PhmA through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis. This study provides the first insight into the biosynthesis of phomactins, laying the foundation for the efficient production of phomactin natural products using synthetic biology approaches.

         <title>Construction of High&#8208;Density Binuclear Site Catalysts from Double Framework Interfaces at the Cooling Stage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ XAFS measurements induced by temperature control describe the evolution of Zn/Co binuclear sites from dual frameworks constructed by COFs on MOFs. Partial Co&#8722;Zn sites begin to form during the heating process at 600&#8211;700&#8201;&#176;C, however, most binuclear sites (Co&#8722;Zn, Co&#8722;Co and Zn&#8722;Zn) are formed during the cooling process to room temperature.







Abstract
Low&#8208;nuclear site catalysts with dual atoms have the potential for applications in energy and catalysis chemistry. Understanding the formation mechanism of dual metal sites is crucial for optimizing local structures and designing desired binuclear sites catalysts. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time the formation process of dual atoms through the pyrolysis of the interface of a double framework using Zn atoms in metal&#8211;organic frameworks and Co atoms in covalent organic frameworks. We unambiguously revealed that the cooling stage is the key point to form the binuclear sites by employing the in situ synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray absorption spectrum technique. The binuclear site catalysts show higher activity and selectivity than single dispersed atom catalysts for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction. This work guides us to synthesize and optimize the various binuclear sites for extensive catalytic applications.

&lt;p&gt;In situ XAFS measurements induced by temperature control describe the evolution of Zn/Co binuclear sites from dual frameworks constructed by COFs on MOFs. Partial Co&#8722;Zn sites begin to form during the heating process at 600&#8211;700&#8201;&#176;C, however, most binuclear sites (Co&#8722;Zn, Co&#8722;Co and Zn&#8722;Zn) are formed during the cooling process to room temperature.

         <title>Carbazole&#8208;Decorated Organoboron Emitters with Low&#8208;Lying HOMO Levels for Solution&#8208;Processed Narrowband Blue Hyperfluorescence OLED Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The narrowband blue emitter with low&#8208;lying the highest occupied molecular orbital level was developed by decorating the multiple resonance core with weakly electron&#8208;donating carbazoles, which suppresses hole trapping effect for facilitating hole transport and avoiding exciton quenching. The optimized solution&#8208;processed pure blue hyperfluorescence device simultaneously obtains record high external quantum efficiency of 29.2&#8201;% and narrow bandwidth of 16.6&#8197;nm.







Abstract
The hyperfluorescence has drawn great attention in achieving efficient narrowband emitting devices based on multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters. However, achieving efficient solution&#8208;processed pure blue hyperfluorescence devices is still a challenge, due to the unbalanced charge transport and serious exciton quenching caused by that the holes are easily trapped on the high&#8208;lying HOMO (the highest occupied molecular orbital) level of traditional diphenylamine&#8208;decorated emitters. Here, we developed two narrowband blue organoboron emitters with low&#8208;lying HOMO levels by decorating the MR&#8208;TADF core with weakly electron&#8208;donating carbazoles, which could suppress the hole trapping effect by reducing the hole traps between host and MR&#8208;TADF emitter from deep (0.40&#8197;eV) to shallow (0.14/0.20&#8197;eV) ones for facilitating hole transport and exciton formation, as well as avoiding exciton quenching. And the large dihedral angle between the carbazole and MR&#8208;TADF core makes the carbazole act as a steric hindrance to inhibit molecular aggregation. Accordingly, the optimized solution&#8208;processed pure blue hyperfluorescence devices simultaneously realize record external quantum efficiency of 29.2&#8201;%, narrowband emission with a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 16.6&#8197;nm, and pure blue color with CIE coordinates of (0.139, 0.189), which is the best result for the solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on MR&#8208;TADF emitters.

         <title>Asymmetric N&#8208;Alkylation of 1H&#8208;Indoles via Carbene Insertion Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
An intermolecular enantioselective N&#8208;alkylation reaction of 1H&#8208;indoles has been developed enabled by cooperative rhodium and chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed N&#8722;H bond insertion reaction. The reaction provides the N&#8208;alkyl indoles with a newly formed stereocenter adjacent to the indole nitrogen atom in good yields (up to 95&#8201;%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee).







Abstract
An intermolecular enantioselective N&#8208;alkylation reaction of 1H&#8208;indoles has been developed by cooperative rhodium and chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed N&#8722;H bond insertion reaction. N&#8208;Alkyl indoles with newly formed stereocenter adjacent to the indole nitrogen atom are produced in good yields (up to 95&#8201;%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee). Importantly, both &#945;&#8208;aryl and &#945;&#8208;alkyl diazoacetates are tolerated, which is extremely rare in asymmetric X&#8722;H (X=N, O, S et&#8197;al.) and C&#8722;H insertion reactions. With this method, only 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of rhodium catalyst and 2.5&#8197;mol&#8201;% of chiral phosphoric acid are required to complete the conversion as well as achieve the high enantioselectivity. Computational studies reveal the cooperative relay of rhodium and chiral phosphoric acid, and the origin of the chemo and stereoselectivity.

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Based Superlattice with Fe(III)&#8208;Regulable Bandgap and Performance for Optimal and Synergistic Sonodynamic&#8211;Chemotherapy Guided by Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>

         <dc:description>
In this study, we developed a sonosensitizer by using superlattices for sonodynamic therapy (SDT) with sonication&#8208;triggered drug release. Introducing Fe(III) through coordinated interactions and changing the Fe(III) content can efficiently enhance and modulate the band gap and improve the outcomes of SDT. Benefiting from the use of Fe(III) as a contrast agent, magnetic resonance imaging&#8208;guided and synergistic therapy can be realized.







Abstract
Superlattices have considerable potential as sonosensitizers for cancer therapy because of their flexible and tunable band gaps, although they have not yet been reported. In this study, a Ti&#8208;based organic&#8211;inorganic superlattice with good electron&#8211;hole separation was synthesized, which consisted of orderly layered superlattices of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;5,5&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (BPDC) and Ti&#8722;O layers. In addition, the superlattice was coordinated with Fe(III) and encapsulated doxorubicin (DOX) to prepare Ti&#8208;BPDC@Fe@DOX@PEG (TFDP) after biocompatibility modification. TFDP can realize the simultaneous generation of reactive oxygen species and release of DOX under ultrasound irradiation. Moreover, adjusting the Fe(III) content can effectively modulate the band gap of the superlattice and increase the efficiency of sonodynamic therapy (SDT). The mechanisms underlying this modulation were explored. TFDP with Fe(III) can also be used as a contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated the ability of TFDP to precisely treat cancer using MRI&#8208;guided SDT/chemotherapy. This study expands the applications of superlattices as sonosensitizers with flexible and tailored modifications and indicates that superlattices are promising for precise and customized treatments.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Substituents Allow Boosted NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence in J&#8208;Type Aggregates for Bioimaging and Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electron&#8208;withdrawing substituent (&#8722;NO2) strategy is reported to construct J&#8208;type aggregates with boosted NIR&#8208;II fluorescence, which can promote slip&#8208;stacked J&#8208;type movement via increased electrostatic repulsion as well as facilitate intermolecular tight stacking by hydrogen bond. This method can be used to manipulate different kinds of organic fluorophores to obtain enhanced fluorescence in aggregate state.







Abstract
Developing molecular fluorophores with enhanced fluorescence in aggregate state for the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) imaging is highly desirable but remains a tremendous challenge due to the lack of reliable design guidelines. Herein, we report an aromatic substituent strategy to construct highly bright NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates. Introduction of electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents at 3,5&#8208;aryl and meso positions of classic boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) skeleton can promote slip&#8208;stacked J&#8208;type arrangement and further boost NIR&#8208;II fluorescence of J&#8208;aggregates via increased electrostatic repulsion and intermolecular hydrogen bond interaction. Notably, NOBDP&#8208;NO2 with three nitro groups (&#8722;NO2) shows intense NIR&#8208;II fluorescence at 1065&#8197;nm and high absolute quantum yield of 3.21&#8201;% in solid state, which can be successfully applied in bioimaging, high&#8208;level encoding encryption, and information storage. Moreover, guided by this electron&#8208;withdrawing substituent strategy, other skeletons (thieno&#8208;fused BODIPY, aza&#8208;BODIPY, and heptamethine cyanine) modified with &#8722;NO2 are converted into J&#8208;type aggregates with enhanced NIR&#8208;II fluorescence, showing great potential to convert aggregation caused emission quenching (ACQ) dyes into brilliant J&#8208;aggregates. This study provides a universal method for construction of strong NIR&#8208;II emissive J&#8208;aggregates by rationally manipulating molecular packing and establishing relationships among molecular structures, intermolecular interactions, and fluorescence properties.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing molecular fluorophores with enhanced fluorescence in aggregate state for the second near-infrared (NIR-II) imaging is highly desirable but remains a tremendous challenge due to the lack of reliable design guidelines. Herein, we report an aromatic substituent strategy to construct highly bright NIR-II J-aggregates. Introduction of electron-withdrawing substituents at 3,5-aryl and &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt; positions of classic boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) skeleton can promote slip-stacked J-type arrangement and further boost NIR-II fluorescence of J-aggregates via increased electrostatic repulsion and intermolecular hydrogen bond interaction. Notably, NOBDP-NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with three nitro groups (&#8722;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) shows intense NIR-II fluorescence at 1065&#8197;nm and high absolute quantum yield of 3.21&#8201;% in solid state, which can be successfully applied in bioimaging, high-level encoding encryption, and information storage. Moreover, guided by this electron-withdrawing substituent strategy, other skeletons (thieno-fused BODIPY, aza-BODIPY, and heptamethine cyanine) modified with &#8722;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are converted into J-type aggregates with enhanced NIR-II fluorescence, showing great potential to convert aggregation caused emission quenching (ACQ) dyes into brilliant J-aggregates. This study provides a universal method for construction of strong NIR-II emissive J-aggregates by rationally manipulating molecular packing and establishing relationships among molecular structures, intermolecular interactions, and fluorescence properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Entropy Confinement Promotes Hydrogenolysis Activity for Polyethylene Upcycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermodynamically unstable adsorption of macromolecular chains on the catalyst surface poses a challenge to the chemical recycling of waste plastics. This work provides an approach that involves the implementation of a space&#8208;confined catalytic strategy to mitigate the conformational entropy of the macromolecular chains, ultimately leading to the stabilization of the transition state and a substantial enhancement in catalytic activity.







Abstract
Chemical upcycling that catalyzes waste plastics back to high&#8208;purity chemicals holds great promise in end&#8208;of&#8208;life plastics valorization. One of the main challenges in this process is the thermodynamic limitations imposed by the high intrinsic entropy of polymer chains, which makes their adsorption on catalysts unfavorable and the transition state unstable. Here, we overcome this challenge by inducing the catalytic reaction inside mesoporous channels, which possess a strong confined ability to polymer chains, allowing for stabilization of the transition state. This approach involves the synthesis of p&#8208;Ru/SBA catalysts, in which Ru nanoparticles are uniformly distributed within the channels of an SBA&#8208;15 support, using a precise impregnation method. The unique design of the p&#8208;Ru/SBA catalyst has demonstrated significant improvements in catalytic performance for the conversion of polyethylene into high&#8208;value liquid fuels, particularly diesel. The catalyst achieved a high solid conversion rate of 1106&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gRu&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 230&#8201;&#176;C. Comparatively, this catalytic activity is 4.9&#8197;times higher than that of a control catalyst, Ru/SiO2, and 14.0&#8197;times higher than that of a commercial catalyst, Ru/C, at 240&#8201;&#176;C. This remarkable catalytic activity opens up immense opportunities for the chemical upcycling of waste plastics.

Abstract
Here we develop Lateral Flow Assays (LFAs) that employ as functional elements DNA&#8208;based structures decorated with reporter tags and recognition elements. We have rationally re&#8208;engineered tile&#8208;based DNA tubular structures that can act as scaffolds and can be decorated with recognition elements of different nature (i.e. antigens, aptamers or proteins) and with orthogonal fluorescent dyes. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle we have developed sandwich and competitive multiplex lateral flow platforms for the detection of several targets, ranging from small molecules (digoxigenin, Dig and dinitrophenol, DNP), to antibodies (Anti&#8208;Dig, Anti&#8208;DNP and Anti&#8208;MUC1/EGFR bispecific antibodies) and proteins (thrombin). Coupling the advantages of functional DNA&#8208;based scaffolds together with the simplicity of LFAs, our approach offers the opportunity to detect a wide range of targets with nanomolar sensitivity and high specificity.

         <title>Efficient Removal of Antibiotic Resistance Genes through 4f&#8208;2p&#8208;3d Gradient Orbital Coupling Mediated Fenton&#8208;Like Redox Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effective gradient 4f&#8211;2p&#8208;3d orbital coupling precisely regulates the electron distribution of Ce&#8722;O&#8722;Co active center microenvironment, thereby realizing efficient PMS activation to rapidly generate more radical and nonradical (&#8901;OH, SO4.&#8722;, and 1O2), and enabling excellent degradation activity of antibiotic resistance genes.







Abstract
Peroxymonosulfate (PMS) mediated radical and nonradical active substances can synergistically achieve the efficient elimination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). However, enhancing interface electron cycling and optimizing the coupling of the oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates to improve PMS activation kinetics remains a major challenge. Here, Co doped CeVO4 catalyst (Co&#8722;CVO) with asymmetric sites was constructed based on Ce&#8197;4f&#8722;O&#8197;2p&#8722;Co&#8197;3d gradient orbital coupling. The catalyst achieved approximately 2.51&#215;105 copies/mL of extracellular ARGs (eARGs) removal within 15&#8197;minutes, exhibited ultrahigh degradation rate (k=1.24&#8197;min&#8722;1). The effective gradient 4f&#8208;2p&#8208;3d orbital coupling precisely regulates the electron distribution of Ce&#8722;O&#8722;Co active center microenvironment, while optimizing the electronic structure of Co&#8197;3d states (especially the occupancy of eg), promoting the adsorption of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates. The generated radical and nonradical generated by interfacial electron cycling enhanced by the reduction reaction of PMS at the Ce site and the oxidation reaction at the Co site achieved a significant mineralization rate of ARGs (83.4&#8201;%). The efficient removal of ARGs by a continuous flow reactor for 10&#8197;hours significantly reduces the ecological risk of ARGs in actual wastewater treatment.

         <title>Water Activation Triggered by Cu&#8722;Co Double&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Silane Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8722;Co double&#8208;atom was precisely synthesized and exhibited better catalytic performance for silane oxidation with H2O. DFT calculations revealed that different mechanisms were observed for DACs and SACs where H2O was dissociated into H* and OH* species by the CuCo&#8208;DAC while the H2O acted as a nucleophile by Cu/Co&#8208;SAC.







Abstract
High&#8208;performance catalysts sufficient to significantly reduce the energy barrier of water activation are crucial in facilitating reactions that are restricted by water dissociation. Herein we present a Cu&#8722;Co double&#8208;atom catalyst (CuCo&#8208;DAC), which possesses a uniform and well&#8208;defined CuCoN6(OH) structure, and works together to promote water activation in silane oxidation. The catalyst achieves superior catalytic performance far exceeding that of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). Various functional silanes are converted into silanols with up to 98&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% selectivity. Kinetic studies show that the activation energy of silane oxidation by CuCo&#8208;DAC is significantly lower than that of Cu single&#8208;atom catalyst (Cu&#8208;SAC) and Co single&#8208;atom catalyst (Co&#8208;SAC). Theoretical calculations demonstrate two different reaction pathways where water splitting is the rate&#8208;determining step and it is accelerated by CuCo&#8208;DAC, whereas H2 formation is key for its single&#8208;atom counterpart.

         <title>Superstructure&#8208;Induced Hierarchical Assemblies for Nanoconfined Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic&#8208;inorganic assemblies based on pillararene&#8208;strutted covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been developed as highly efficient photocatalysts for the synthesis of bioactive molecules (benzo[d]imidazoles). The pillararenes in the assemblies play an important role in enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency, thus providing valuable insights into the construction of multifunctional porous materials with innovative and designable functions.







Abstract
Most attempts to synthesize supramolecular nanosystems are limited to a single mechanism, often resulting in the formation of nanomaterials that lack diversity in properties. Herein, hierarchical assemblies with appropriate variety are fabricated in bulk via a superstructure&#8208;induced organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid strategy. The dynamic balance between substructures and superstructures is managed using covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) as dual building blocks to regulate the performances of hierarchical assemblies. Significantly, the superstructures resulting from the controlled cascade between COFs and MOFs create highly active photocatalytic systems through multiple topologies. Our designed tandem photocatalysis can precisely and efficiently regulate the conversion rates of bioactive molecules (benzo[d]imidazoles) through competing redox pathways. Furthermore, benzo[d]imidazoles catalyzed by such supramolecular nanosystems can be isolated in yields ranging from 70&#8201;% to 93&#8201;% within tens of minutes. The multilayered structural states within the supramolecular systems demonstrate the importance of hierarchical assemblies in facilitating photocatalytic propagation and expanding the structural repertoire of supramolecular hybrids.

         <title>Creating a Defined Chirality in Amino Acids and Cyclic Dipeptides by Photochemical Deracemization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wide range of 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazines underwent stereochemical editing at position C6 leading to the formation of products with a defined configuration which was retained in consecutive reactions. Spectroscopic evidence was collected corroborating a hydrogen atom transfer to the photocatalyst as the pivotal step of the process.







Abstract
2,5&#8208;Diketopiperazines are cyclic dipeptides displaying a wide range of applications. Their enantioselective preparation has now been found possible from the respective racemates by a photochemical deracemization (53 examples, 74&#8201;% to quantitative yield, 71&#8211;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee). A chiral benzophenone catalyst in concert with irradiation at &#955;=366&#8197;nm enables to establish the configuration at the stereogenic carbon atom C6 at will. If other stereogenic centers are present in the diketopiperazines they remain unaffected and a stereochemical editing is possible at a single position. Consecutive reactions, including the conversion into N&#8208;aryl or N&#8208;alkyl amino acids or the reduction to piperazines, occur without compromising the newly created stereogenic center. Transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that the benzophenone catalyst processes one enantiomer of the 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazines preferentially and enables a reversible hydrogen atom transfer that is responsible for the deracemization process. The remarkably long lifetime of the protonated ketyl radical implies a yet unprecedented mode of action.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Degenerate Semiconductor Photocatalysis for Efficient Water Splitting without Sacrificial Agents via a Reticular Chemistry Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;degenerate photocatalyst allows efficient total water splitting without scavengers by concurrently enriching electron density at the point&#8208;of&#8208;use for enhanced catalysis and delocalizing photogenerated holes into MOF for oxygen evolution. Notably, our multifunctional interface boosts hydrogen evolution and apparent quantum efficiency up to 13&#8208;fold and 8&#8208;fold when compared to emerging photocatalytic designs utilizing hole scavengers.







Abstract
The production of green hydrogen through photocatalytic water splitting is crucial for a sustainable hydrogen economy and chemical manufacturing. However, current approaches suffer from slow hydrogen production (&lt;70&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) due to the sluggish four&#8208;electrons oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and limited catalyst activity. Herein, we achieve efficient photocatalytic water splitting by exploiting a multifunctional interface between a nano&#8208;photocatalyst and metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) layer. The functional interface plays two critical roles: (1) enriching electron density directly on photocatalyst surface to promote catalytic activity, and (2) delocalizing photogenerated holes into MOF to enhance OER. Our photocatalytic ensemble boosts hydrogen evolution by &#8776;100&#8208;fold over pristine photocatalyst and concurrently produces oxygen at ideal stoichiometric ratio, even without using sacrificial agents. Notably, this unique design attains superior hydrogen production (519&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) and apparent quantum efficiency up to 13&#8208;fold and 8&#8208;fold better than emerging photocatalytic designs utilizing hole scavengers. Comprehensive investigations underscore the vital role of the interfacial design in generating high&#8208;energy photoelectrons on surface&#8208;degenerate photocatalyst to thermodynamically drive hydrogen evolution, while leveraging the nanoporous MOF scaffold as an effective photohole sink to enhance OER. Our interfacial approach creates vast opportunities for designing next&#8208;generation, multifunctional photocatalytic ensembles using reticular chemistry with diverse energy and environmental applications.

         <title>CO Binding Energy is an Incomplete Descriptor of Cu&#8208;Based Catalysts for the Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Correlation of the standard adsorption enthalpy of CO with the Faradaic efficiencies for C2+ products was established through combined reactivity and spectroscopic investigations. The CO binding energy is a relevant but incomplete descriptor for the selectivity of Cu&#8208;catalyzed CO2RR. The relative abundance of Cu sites active for the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion (CuCO2) and the further reduction of CO (CuCO) is identified as another key descriptor.







Abstract
CO binding energy has been employed as a descriptor in the catalyst design for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions (CO2RR). The reliability of the descriptor has yet been experimentally verified due to the lack of suitable methods to determine CO binding energies. In this work, we determined the standard CO adsorption enthalpies (
) of undoped and doped oxide&#8208;derived Cu (OD&#8722;Cu) samples, and for the first time established the correlation of 
 with the Faradaic efficiencies (FE) for C2+ products. A clear volcano shaped dependence of the FE for C2+ products on 
 is observed on OD&#8722;Cu catalysts prepared with the same hydrothermal durations, however, the trend becomes less clear when all catalysts investigated are taken into account. The relative abundance of Cu sites active for the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion and the further reduction of CO is identified as another key descriptor.

         <title>Super&#8208;Oxidizing Covalent Triazine Framework Electrocatalyst for Two&#8208;Electron Water Oxidation to H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent Triazine Frameworks (CTFs) are a class of extended porous organic network with tunable redox properties. A CTF with high oxidizing property is reported here that can selectively generate hydrogen peroxide by stepwise oxidation of water, detailing the mechanism both experimentally and theoretically. This is the first example of a beyond&#8208;carbon metal&#8208;free catalyst showing better performance than most contemporary electrode materials.







Abstract
Electrochemical two&#8208;electron water oxidation (2e WOR) is gaining surging research traction for sustainable hydrogen peroxide production. However, the strong oxidizing environment and thermodynamically competitive side&#8208;reaction (4e WOR) posit as thresholds for the 2e WOR. We herein report a custom&#8208;crafted covalent triazine network possessing strong oxidizing properties as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept metal&#8208;free functional organic network electrocatalyst for catalyzing 2e WOR. As the first&#8208;of&#8208;its&#8208;kind, the material shows a maximum of 89.9&#8201;% Faradaic Efficiency and 1428&#8197;&#956;mol/h/cm2 H2O2 production rate at 3.0&#8197;V bias potential (vs reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE), which are either better or comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts.

     alt="Super-Oxidizing Covalent Triazine Framework Electrocatalyst for Two-Electron Water Oxidation to H2O2"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covalent Triazine Frameworks (CTFs) are a class of extended porous organic network with tunable redox properties. A CTF with high oxidizing property is reported here that can selectively generate hydrogen peroxide by stepwise oxidation of water, detailing the mechanism both experimentally and theoretically. This is the first example of a beyond-carbon metal-free catalyst showing better performance than most contemporary electrode materials.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical two-electron water oxidation (2e WOR) is gaining surging research traction for sustainable hydrogen peroxide production. However, the strong oxidizing environment and thermodynamically competitive side-reaction (4e WOR) posit as thresholds for the 2e WOR. We herein report a custom-crafted covalent triazine network possessing strong oxidizing properties as a proof-of-concept metal-free functional organic network electrocatalyst for catalyzing 2e WOR. As the first-of-its-kind, the material shows a maximum of 89.9&#8201;% Faradaic Efficiency and 1428&#8197;&#956;mol/h/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate at 3.0&#8197;V bias potential (&lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt; reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE), which are either better or comparable to the state-of-the-art electrocatalysts. We have experimentally confirmed a stepwise 2e WOR mechanism which was further computationally endorsed by density functional theory studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Desymmetrization of Geminal Difluoromethylenes using a Palladium/Copper/Lithium Ternary System for the Stereodivergent Synthesis of Fluorinated Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A desymmetrization of geminal difluoromethylenes using a palladium/copper/lithium ternary system was developed for the stereodivergent synthesis of chiral fluorinated amino acids. This ternary system afforded the allylic and benzylic substituted fluorinated &#945;&#8208;amino acids in good yields with excellent stereoselectivities in a stereodivergent manner (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr)







Abstract
Fluorinated amino acids and related peptides/proteins have been found widespread applications in pharmaceutical and agricultural compounds. However, strategies for introducing a C&#8722;F bond into amino acids in an enantioselective manner are still limited and no such asymmetric catalysis strategy has been reported. Herein, we have successfully developed a Pd/Cu/Li ternary system for stereodivergent synthesis of chiral fluorinated amino acids. This method involves a sequential desymmetrization of geminal difluoromethylenes and allylic substitution with amino acid Schiff bases via Pd/Li and Pd/Cu dual activation, respectively. A series of non&#8208;natural amino acids bearing a chiral allylic/benzylic fluorine motif are easily synthesized in high yields with excellent regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and &gt;99&#8201;% ee). A density functional theory (DFT) study revealed the F&#8722;Cu interaction of the allylic substrate and the Cu catalyst significantly influence the stereoselectivity.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Zinc Sites with Synergetic Multiple Coordination Shells for Electrochemical H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric Zn&#8722;N2O2 moiety modulated with S species in higher coordination shells is obtained by a general two&#8208;step strategy. The synergy between the nearest N2O2 coordination and S atoms in the second coordination shell leads to robust Zn sites with optimized electronic structure and nearly ideal Gibbs free energy for the key OOH* intermediate. The Zn&#8722;N2O2&#8722;S single&#8208;atom catalyst exhibits impressive electrochemical H2O2 production performance.







Abstract
Precise manipulation of the coordination environment of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), particularly the simultaneous engineering of multiple coordination shells, is crucial to maximize their catalytic performance but remains challenging. Herein, we present a general two&#8208;step strategy to fabricate a series of hollow carbon&#8208;based SACs featuring asymmetric Zn&#8722;N2O2 moieties simultaneously modulated with S atoms in higher coordination shells of Zn centers (n&#8805;2; designated as Zn&#8722;N2O2&#8722;S). Systematic analyses demonstrate that the synergetic effects between the N2O2 species in the first coordination shell and the S atoms in higher coordination shells lead to robust discrete Zn sites with the optimal electronic structure for selective O2 reduction to H2O2. Remarkably, the Zn&#8722;N2O2 moiety with S atoms in the second coordination shell possesses a nearly ideal Gibbs free energy for the key OOH* intermediate, which favors the formation and desorption of OOH* on Zn sites for H2O2 generation. Consequently, the Zn&#8722;N2O2&#8722;S SAC exhibits impressive electrochemical H2O2 production performance with high selectivity of 96&#8201;%. Even at a high current density of 80&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in the flow cell, it shows a high H2O2 production rate of 6.924&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with an average Faradaic efficiency of 93.1&#8201;%, and excellent durability over 65&#8197;h.

         <title>Scalable Synthesis and Electrocatalytic Performance of Highly Fluorinated Covalent Organic Frameworks for Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a class of crystalline polymers. Herein we report the room temperature and scalable synthesis of two isostructural COFs, modulated by the introduction of fluorine atoms, obtaining an extended framework with record number of F per pore. The substitution produces a dramatical increase of selectivity for the oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalysis, with a response comparable to other noble electrocatalysts.







Abstract
In this study, we present a novel approach for the synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that overcomes the common limitations of non&#8208;scalable solvothermal procedures. Our method allows for the room&#8208;temperature and scalable synthesis of a highly fluorinated DFTAPB&#8208;TFTA&#8208;COF, which exhibits intrinsic hydrophobicity. We used DFT&#8208;based calculations to elucidate the role of the fluorine atoms in enhancing the crystallinity of the material through corrugation effects, resulting in maximized interlayer interactions, as disclosed both from PXRD structural resolution and theoretical simulations. We further investigated the electrocatalytic properties of this material towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Our results show that the fluorinated COF produces hydrogen peroxide selectively with low overpotential (0.062&#8197;V) and high turnover frequency (0.0757&#8197;s&#8722;1) without the addition of any conductive additives. These values are among the best reported for non&#8208;pyrolyzed and metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts. Finally, we employed DFT&#8208;based calculations to analyse the reaction mechanism, highlighting the crucial role of the fluorine atom in the active site assembly. Our findings shed light on the potential of fluorinated COFs as promising electrocatalysts for the ORR, as well as their potential applications in other fields.

The unprecedented covalent three dimensionally patterned graphene heterostructures consisting of a graphene monolayer, a tailor&#8208;made organophenyl bridging layer, and three metal oxide films (ZnO, Al2O3, and CuO) were constructed. These spatially resolved and hierarchically structured nano&#8208;ensembles are generated via a 2D&#8208;functionalization&#8208;mediated atomic layer deposition growth process.







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensionally (3D) well&#8208;ordered and highly integrated graphene hybrid architectures are considered to be next&#8208;generation multifunctional graphene materials but still remain elusive. Here, we report the first realization of unprecedented 3D&#8208;patterned graphene nano&#8208;ensembles composed of a graphene monolayer, a tailor&#8208;made structured organophenyl layer, and three metal oxide films, providing the first example of such a hybrid nano&#8208;architecture. These spatially resolved and hierarchically structured quinary hybrids are generated via a two&#8208;dimensional (2D)&#8208;functionalization&#8208;mediated atomic layer deposition growth process, involving an initial lateral molecular programming of the graphene lattice via lithography&#8208;assisted 2D functionalization and a subsequent stepwise molecular assembly in these regions in the z&#8208;direction. Our breakthrough lays the foundation for the construction of emerging 3D&#8208;patterned graphene heterostructures.

These spatially resolved and hierarchically structured nano-ensembles are generated via a 2D-functionalization-mediated atomic layer deposition growth process.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three-dimensionally (3D) well-ordered and highly integrated graphene hybrid architectures are considered to be next-generation multifunctional graphene materials but still remain elusive. Here, we report the first realization of unprecedented 3D-patterned graphene nano-ensembles composed of a graphene monolayer, a tailor-made structured organophenyl layer, and three metal oxide films, providing the first example of such a hybrid nano-architecture. These spatially resolved and hierarchically structured quinary hybrids are generated via a two-dimensional (2D)-functionalization-mediated atomic layer deposition growth process, involving an initial lateral molecular programming of the graphene lattice via lithography-assisted 2D functionalization and a subsequent stepwise molecular assembly in these regions in the z-direction. Our breakthrough lays the foundation for the construction of emerging 3D-patterned graphene heterostructures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stability and Crystallinity of Sodium Poly(Heptazine Imide) in Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium poly(heptazine imide) (PHI&#8722;Na) ultrathin nanosheets with high crystallinity were synthesized, by enhancing contact of melamine and NaCl via dissolution&#8208;evaporation and ball&#8208;milling joint treatment, and exhibit high photocatalytic activity in hydrogen evolution from water splitting, but, unconventionally, remarkable photochemical instability owing to gradual Na+ loss, which, interestingly, can be retarded by the common ion effect.







Abstract
Poly(heptazine imide) (PHI) salts, as crystalline carbon nitrides, exhibit high photocatalytic activity and are being extensively researched, but its photochemical instability has not drawn researchers&#8217; attention yet. Herein, sodium PHI (PHI&#8722;Na) ultrathin nanosheets with increased crystallinity, synthesized by enhancing contact of melamine with NaCl functioning as a structure&#8208;induction agent and hard template, exhibits improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity, but low photochemical stability, owing to Na+ loss in the photocatalytic process, which, interestingly, can be enhanced by the common ion effect, e.g., addition of NaCl that is also able to remarkably increase the photoactivity with the apparent quantum yield at 420&#8197;nm reaching 41.5&#8201;%. This work aims at attracting research peers&#8217; attention to photochemical instability of PHI salts and provides a way to enhance their crystallinity.

         <title>Asymmetric Substitution by Alkynyl Copper Driven Dearomatization and Rearomatization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkynyl copper facilitates dearomatization through the involvement of a d&#8208;orbital electron of the transition metal, and was applied to a novel remote substitution reaction. A newly modified PyBox ligand enabled the construction of diarylmethyl and triarylmethyl skeletons with high enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Catalytic asymmetric transformations by dearomatization have developed into a widely applicable synthetic strategy, but heavily relied on the use of arenes bearing a heteroatom. In this case, the dearomatization is facilitated by the involvement of a p&#8208;orbital electron of the heteroatom. Different from the conventional substrate&#8208;dependent model, here we demonstrate that the activation by a d&#8208;orbital electron of the transition&#8208;metal center can serve as a driving force for dearomatization, and is applied to the development of a novel asymmetric alkynyl copper facilitated remote substitution reaction. A newly modified PyBox chiral ligand enables the construction of valuable diarylmethyl and triarylmethyl skeletons in high enantioselectivities. An unexpected tandem process involving sequential remote substitution/cyclization/1,5&#8208;H shift leads to the formation of the enantioenriched C&#8722;N axis. A gram&#8208;scale reaction and various downstream transformations highlight the robustness of this method and the potential transformations of the products. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal a mononuclear Cu&#8208;catalyzed remote substitution process.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D plasmonic molecules &#160;are constructed by hydrogen bond interaction between a donor&#8211;acceptor pair of polymer&#8208;grafted gold nanoparticles. As demonstrated in the Research Article (e202309798) by Yingying Cai and Philipp Vana, the weak yet multidentate hydrogen bonding allows a structural rearrangement from 3D to 2D when cast onto a substrate. Precise control of the coordination number is enabled by fine&#8208;tuning the interparticle interaction.

         <dc:description>
A library of synthetic full&#8208;length Max transcription factor variants with distinct modifications was prepared to investigate the impact of Ser phosphorylation, as reported by Ariel Afek, Muhammad Jbara et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202310913). Comprehensive DNA binding analysis and high&#8208;throughput screening revealed that the phosphorylation pattern plays a crucial role in DNA&#8208;binding activity but does not affect sequence specificity. The insights gained into the regulatory role of Max phosphorylation shed light on how post&#8208;translational modifications influence transcription factor activity.

Anti&#8208;Stokes fluorescence lifetime imaging in living cells was demonstrated by Rachel C. Evans et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202308602). This was achieved through the design of ultra&#8208;small nanoparticle probes based on triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) chromophores encapsulated in an organic&#8211;inorganic ureasil host. Fluctuations of the UC lifetime in the stained cells suggest that the NPs can be used to map local oxygen diffusion across the subcellular structure.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Giant Crystalline Molecular Rotors that Operate in the Solid State (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 47/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of crystalline materials in which a bulky iptycene derivative (pentiptycene) exhibits rotational dynamics in the solid state is reported by Hajime Ito, Mingoo Jin et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202309694). It is revealed that encapsulation by a large concave N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand provides reasonable rotational space around the central rotator. This platform will enable the further design of systems in which large and complex molecular units exhibit rotational motion in solid.

         <title>Self&#8208;Growing Organic Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;growing organic materials can absorb externally provided nutrient compounds to modify their sizes, shapes, structures, and properties. This Minireview describes the concept of these materials and their recent progress, including the self&#8208;growing strategies, mass transport mechanisms in growth, simulation models, and potential applications. It provides researchers with a comprehensive understanding of this emerging new field.







Abstract
The growth of living systems is ubiquitous. Living organisms can continually update their sizes, shapes, and properties to meet various environmental challenges. Such a capability is also demonstrated by emerging self&#8208;growing materials that can incorporate externally provided compounds to grow as living organisms. In this Minireview, we summarize these materials in terms of six aspects. First, we discuss their essential characteristics, then describe the strategies for enabling crosslinked organic materials to self&#8208;grow from nutrient solutions containing polymerizable compounds. The developed examples are grouped into five categories based on their molecular mechanisms. We then explain the mechanism of mass transport within polymer networks during growth, which is critical for controlling the shape and morphology of the grown products. Afterwards, simulation models built to explain the interesting phenomena observed in self&#8208;growing materials are discussed. The development of self&#8208;growing materials is accompanied by various applications, including tuning bulk properties, creating textured surfaces, growth&#8208;induced self&#8208;healing, 4D printing, self&#8208;growing implants, actuation, self&#8208;growing structural coloration, and others. These examples are then summed up. Finally, we discuss the opportunities brought by self&#8208;growing materials and their facing challenges.

         <title>Design and Application of Peptide&#8208;Mimic Phosphonium Salt Catalysts in Asymmetric Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide&#8208;mimic phosphonium salt catalysts, a judicious combination of ion&#8208;pair elements with peptide scaffolds that bear multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding donors, have captivated considerable attention for their unprecedented performance in a plethora of enantioselective transformations, in many cases enabling never&#8208;before&#8208;seen patterns of reactivity and selectivity. In this context, we provide a succinct overview of recent progress in this field.







Abstract
Chiral phosphonium salt catalysis, traditionally classified as a type of phase transfer catalysis, has proven to be a powerful strategy for the stereoselective preparation of diverse optically active molecules. However, there still remain numerous forbidding issues of reactivity and selectivity in such well&#8208;known organocatalysis system. Accordingly, the development of new and high&#8208;performance phosphonium salt catalysts with unique chiral backbones is highly desirable, yet challenging. This Minireview describes the prominent endeavours in the development of a new family of chiral peptide&#8208;mimic phosphonium salt catalysts with multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding donors and their applications in a plethora of enantioselective synthesis during the past few years. Hopefully, this minireview will pave a way for further developing much more efficient and privileged chiral ligands/catalysts featuring exclusively catalytic ability in asymmetric synthesis.

         <title>Alignment and Dynamic Inversion of Planar Chirality in Pillar[n]arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pillar[n]arenes are unique cylindrical macrocycles in which the planar chirality of their &#960;&#8208;units can be inverted through unit flipping but prefers to be aligned. This Minireview describes how these features have led to the development of chiroptical molecules, dynamic chirality alignment phenomena in tubular assemblies of pillar[n]arenes, and environment&#8208;responsive chiral outputs in diastereomeric systems with additional chiral sources.







Abstract
Pillar[n]arenes are symmetrical macrocyclic compounds composed of benzene panels with para&#8208;methylene linkages. Each panel usually exhibits planar chirality and prefers chirality&#8208;aligned states. Because of this feature, pillar[n]arenes are attractive scaffolds for chiroptical materials that are easy to prepare and optically resolve and show intense circular dichroism (CD) signals. In addition, rotation of the panels endows the chirality of pillar[n]arenes with a dynamic nature. The chirality in tubular oligomers and supramolecular assemblies sometimes show time&#8208; and procedure&#8208;dependent alignment phenomena. Furthermore, the CD signals of some pillar[n]arenes respond to the addition of chiral guests when their dynamic chirality is coupled with host&#8211;guest properties. By using diastereomeric pillar[n]arenes with additional chiral structures, the response can also be caused by achiral guests and changes of the environment, providing molecular sensors.

         <title>Artificial Molecular Ratchets: Tools Enabling Endergonic Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
How can we realize thermodynamically unfavored chemical processes? The operating principles of molecular machines&#8212;ratchet mechanisms&#8212;can help answer this. This tutorial Review provides an overview that balances experimental examples with rationalizations, while detaching from directional motion. A unifying picture is offered for chemical&#8208;, light&#8208;, and redox&#8208;driven systems, highlighting connections with active transport and bioenergetics, among others.







Abstract
Non&#8208;equilibrium chemical systems underpin multiple domains of contemporary interest, including supramolecular chemistry, molecular machines, systems chemistry, prebiotic chemistry, and energy transduction. Experimental chemists are now pioneering the realization of artificial systems that can harvest energy away from equilibrium. In this tutorial Review, we provide an overview of artificial molecular ratchets: the chemical mechanisms enabling energy absorption from the environment. By focusing on the mechanism type&#8212;rather than the application domain or energy source&#8212;we offer a unifying picture of seemingly disparate phenomena, which we hope will foster progress in this fascinating domain of science.

         <title>Constructing Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
The solid electrolyte interphase plays an important role for the stability of zinc anodes. This Review summarizes the construction methods, formation mechanisms, composition and electrochemical performance of SEIs, thus providing guidance for the construction of high&#8208;performance zinc anodes.







Abstract
Problems of zinc anode including dendrite and hydrogen evolution seriously degrade the performance of zinc batteries. Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), which plays a key role in achieving high reversibility of lithium anode in aprotic organic solvent, is also beneficial to performance improvement of zinc anode in aqueous electrolyte. However, various studies about interphase for zinc electrode is quite fragmented, and lack of deep understanding on root causes or general design rules for SEI construction. And water molecules with high reactivity brings serious challenge to the effective SEI construction. Here, we reviewed the brief development history of zinc batteries firstly, then summarized the approaches to construct SEI in aqueous electrolyte. Furthermore, the formation mechanisms behind approaches are systematically analyzed, together with discussion on the SEI components and evaluation on electrochemical performance of zinc anode with various types of SEI. Meanwhile, the challenge between lab and industrialization are also discussed.

         <title>In Situ Spectroscopic Detection of Large&#8208;Scale Reorientations of Transmembrane Helices During Influenza A M2 Channel Opening
</title>

         <dc:description>
Viroporins are small viral ion channels that play essential roles during viral infections. Using surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy we track and quantify the large&#8208;scale structural changes during opening of the Influenza A viroporin, the M2 proton channel, in a model membrane. This motion is blocked by inhibition providing a clear spectroscopic strategy to explore mechanisms of viroporin function and test new antiviral drugs.







Abstract
Viroporins are small ion channels in membranes of enveloped viruses that play key roles during viral life cycles. To use viroporins as drug targets against viral infection requires in&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding and, with that, methods that enable investigations under in situ conditions. Here, we apply surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy to Influenza A M2 reconstituted within a solid&#8208;supported membrane, to shed light on the mechanics of its viroporin function. M2 is a paradigm of pH&#8208;activated proton channels and controls the proton flux into the viral interior during viral infection. We use SEIRA to track the large&#8208;scale reorientation of M2&#8217;s transmembrane &#945;&#8208;helices in situ during pH&#8208;activated channel opening. We quantify this event as a helical tilt from 26&#176; to 40&#176; by correlating the experimental results with solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance&#8208;informed computational spectroscopy. This mechanical motion is impeded upon addition of the inhibitor rimantadine, giving a direct spectroscopic marker to test antiviral activity. The presented approach provides a spectroscopic tool to quantify large&#8208;scale structural changes and to track the function and inhibition of the growing number of viroporins from pathogenic viruses in future studies.

         <title>Detection of Per&#8208; and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) by Interrupted Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The light&#8208;harvesting ability of a highly fluorinated poly(p&#8208;phenylene ethynylene) has been used to amplify the emission of an embedded fluorinated squaraine dye through an electron&#8208;exchange&#8208;based energy transfer to afford a fluorescence sensor that can detect aqueous per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) at &#956;g/L levels. Exposure to aqueous solutions of PFAS diminishes the efficiency of the energy transfer and leads to a ratiometric fluorescence response.







Abstract
The ubiquitous presence of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in aqueous environments has aroused societal concern. Nonetheless, effective sensing technologies for continuous monitoring of PFAS within water distribution infrastructures currently do not exist. Herein, we describe a ratiometric sensing approach to selectively detect aqueous perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) at concentrations of &#956;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1. Our method relies on the excitonic transport in a highly fluorinated poly(p&#8208;phenylene ethynylene) to amplify a ratiometric emission signal modulated by an embedded fluorinated squaraine dye. The electronic coupling between the polymer and dye occurs through overlap of &#960;&#8208;orbitals and is designed such that energy transfer is dominated by an electron&#8208;exchange (Dexter) mechanism. Exposure to aqueous solutions of PFAS perturbs the orbital interactions between the squaraine dye and the polymer backbone, thereby diminishing the efficiency of the energy transfer and producing a &#8220;polymer&#8208;ON/dye&#8208;OFF&#8221; response. These polymer/dye combinations were evaluated in spin&#8208;coated films and polymer nanoparticles and were able to selectively detect PFAS at concentrations of ca. 150 ppb and ca. 50 ppb, respectively. Both polymer films and nanoparticles are not affected by the type of water, and similar responses to PFAS were found in milliQ and well water.

         <title>Controlling the Assembly of Cellulose&#8208;Based Oligosaccharides through Sequence Modifications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic cellulose&#8208;based oligosaccharides were designed to generate carbohydrate assemblies with tunable shapes and properties. Rod&#8208; or square&#8208;like crystalline materials as well as supramolecular hydrogels were obtained following systematic modifications of the glycan primary sequences. Synthetic carbohydrate&#8208;based materials could offer new tools to material scientists and supramolecular chemists.







Abstract
Peptides and nucleic acids with programmable sequences are widely explored for the production of tunable, self&#8208;assembling functional materials. Herein we demonstrate that the primary sequence of oligosaccharides can be designed to access materials with tunable shapes and properties. Synthetic cellulose&#8208;based oligomers were assembled into 2D or 3D rod&#8208;like crystallites. Sequence modifications within the oligosaccharide core influenced the molecular packing and led to the formation of square&#8208;like assemblies based on the rare cellulose IVII allomorph. In contrast, modifications at the termini generated elongated aggregates with tunable surfaces, resulting in self&#8208;healing supramolecular hydrogels.

         <title>Quantitative Determination of Water in Organic Liquids by Ambient Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trace water monitoring in complex mixtures using mass spectrometry (MS) has been developed. A charge labelled electrophile functions as a mass tag to specifically capture water from the mixture. Dynamic monitoring of water content in levitated droplets and in chemical reaction mixtures facilitates mechanistic investigations of processes involving water.







Abstract
This study uses a rapid tandem mass&#8208;spectrometry method to determine water content in complex organic solutions. Emphasis is placed on trace&#8208;water analysis by a fast and accurate alternative to the Karl&#8211;Fischer method. In this new method, water is captured by a charge&#8208;labeled molecular probe. Water binds strongly with high specificity to the strongly electrophilic aldehyde site in a charge&#8208;labelled molecule (N&#8208;methylpyridinium); competitive binding by other analytes is effectively discriminated against in the mass&#8208;measurement step. Quantitative determinations are made over a wide concentration range, 0.001&#8201;% (10&#8197;ppm) to 99&#8201;%, with better than 10&#8201;% relative standard deviation, along with short (1&#8197;min) analysis times using small sample volumes (several &#956;L). Applications include water measurement in simple organic solvents, for example, deuterated solvents, as well as in complex mixtures, for example, organic reaction mixtures. Additionally, this method allows for water monitoring in levitated droplets. Mechanistic investigations into the impact of water on important chemical processes in organic synthesis and environmental science are reported.

         <title>Stabilization Of The CN35&#8722; Anion In Recoverable High&#8208;pressure Ln3O2(CN3) (Ln=La, Eu, Gd, Tb, Ho, Yb) Oxoguanidinates</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of recoverable Ln3O2(CN3) (Ln=La, Eu, Gd, Tb, Ho, Yb) oxoguanidinates was synthesized under high&#8208;pressure (25&#8211;54&#8197;GPa) high&#8208;temperature (2000&#8211;3000&#8197;K) conditions in laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cells. The first stabilization of CN35&#8722; guanidinate anion&#8212;deprotonated guanidine&#8212;was achieved.







Abstract
A series of isostructural Ln3O2(CN3) (Ln=La, Eu, Gd, Tb, Ho, Yb) oxoguanidinates was synthesized under high&#8208;pressure (25&#8211;54&#8197;GPa) high&#8208;temperature (2000&#8211;3000&#8197;K) conditions in laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cells. The crystal structure of this novel class of compounds was determined via synchrotron single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) as well as corroborated by X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The Ln3O2(CN3) solids are composed of the hitherto unknown CN35&#8722; guanidinate anion&#8212;deprotonated guanidine. Changes in unit cell volumes and compressibility of Ln3O2(CN3) (Ln=La, Eu, Gd, Tb, Ho, Yb) compounds are found to be dictated by the lanthanide contraction phenomenon. Decompression experiments show that Ln3O2(CN3) compounds are recoverable to ambient conditions. The stabilization of the CN35&#8722; guanidinate anion at ambient conditions provides new opportunities in inorganic and organic synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Stabilization of Guanidinate Anions [CN3]5&#8722; in Calcite&#8208;Type SbCN3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antimony guanidinate SbCN3 was produced in a high&#8208;pressure&#8208;high&#8208;temperature synthesis in a laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell. The compound can be produced from elements as well as via a reaction between antimony and cyanuric triazide. This study demonstrates a straightforward route to novel nitridocarbonates. SbCN3 is a direct band gap semiconductor with Eg=2.20&#8197;eV as shown by theoretical calculations.







Abstract
The stabilization of nitrogen&#8208;rich phases presents a significant chemical challenge due to the inherent stability of the dinitrogen molecule. This stabilization can be achieved by utilizing strong covalent bonds in complex anions with carbon, such as cyanide CN&#8722; and NCN2&#8722; carbodiimide, while more nitrogen&#8208;rich carbonitrides are hitherto unknown. Following a rational chemical design approach, we synthesized antimony guanidinate SbCN3 at pressures of 32&#8211;38&#8197;GPa using various synthetic routes in laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cells. SbCN3, which is isostructural to calcite CaCO3, can be recovered under ambient conditions. Its structure contains the previously elusive guanidinate anion [CN3]5&#8722;, marking a fundamental milestone in carbonitride chemistry. The crystal structure of SbCN3 was solved and refined from synchrotron single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data and was fully corroborated by theoretical calculations, which also predict that SbCN3 has a direct band gap with the value of 2.20&#8197;eV. This study opens a straightforward route to the entire new family of inorganic nitridocarbonates.

         <title>Isomer Effect on Energy Storage of &#960;&#8208;Extended S&#8208;Shaped Double[6]Heterohelicene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#960;&#8208;extended double heterohelical nanographene of thienothiophene core fused with two hexabenzocoronene units exhibits excellent performance as an anode in a lithium&#8208;ion battery. The isomer (PP and MM) with more interlayer distance exhibited a high lithium storage capability compared to the other isomer and racemic mixture. Helical nanographene anodes display excellent rate capability, superior long&#8208;term cycling performance, and recyclability.







Abstract
Recently, chiral and nonplanar cutouts of graphene have been the favorites due to their unique optical, electronic, and redox properties and high solubility compared with their planar counterparts. Despite the remarkable progress in helicenes, &#960;&#8208;extended heterohelicenes have not been widely explored. As an anode in a lithium&#8208;ion battery, the racemic mixture of &#960;&#8208;extended double heterohelical nanographene containing thienothiophene core exhibited a high lithium storage capability, attaining a specific capacity of 424&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with excellent rate capability and superior long&#8208;term cycling performance over 6000&#8197;cycles with negligible fade. As a first report, the &#960;&#8208;extended helicene isomer (PP and MM), with the more interlayer distance that helps faster diffusion of ions, has exhibited a high capacity of 300&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with long&#8208;term cycling performance over 1500&#8197;cycles compared to the less performing MP and PM isomer and racemic mixture (150&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). As supported by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis, a unique molecular design of nanographenes with a fixed (helical) molecular geometry, avoiding restacking of the layers, renders better performance as an anode in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Interestingly, the recycled nanographene anode material displayed comparable performance.

         <title>Escape from Hydrofunctionalization: Palladium Hydride&#8208;Enabled Difunctionalization of Conjugated Dienes and Enynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium hydride&#8208;catalyzed difunctionalization of dienes and enynes is reported. This mild protocol harnesses visible light to enhance the hydricity of PdH species, enabling a chemoselectivity switch of the hydropalladation step. This method allows for annulation of dienes and enynes with abundant substrates, such as acrylic acids, acrylic amides, and Baylis&#8211;Hillman adducts, toward alkenyl or alkynyl lactones, lactams, and tetrahydrofurans.







Abstract
Palladium hydrides are traditionally employed in hydrofunctionalization (i.e. monofunctionalization) of conjugated dienes and enynes, owning to its facile protic hydropalladation of electron&#8208;rich (or neutral) unsaturated bonds. Herein, we report a mild PdH&#8208;catalyzed difunctionalization of conjugated dienes and enynes. This protocol is enabled by the chemoselectivity switch of the initial hydropalladation step achieved by visible light enhancement of hydricity of PdH species. This method allows for cascade annulation of dienes and enynes with various easily available and abundant substrates, such as acrylic acids, acrylic amides, and Baylis&#8211;Hillman adducts, toward a wide range of alkenyl or alkynyl lactones, lactams, and tetrahydrofurans. This protocol also provides an easy access to complex spiro&#8208;fused tricyclic frameworks.

         <title>A Reversible Six&#8208;Electron Transfer Cathode for Advanced Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nano&#8208;sized TeO2/C composite with facilitated electrochemical kinetics and feasible thermodynamics is proposed as a promising six&#8208;electron transfer cathode for aqueous Zn batteries. The reversible three&#8208;phase conversion (TeO2&#8596;Te and Te&#8596;ZnTe) and proton&#8208;dependent reaction mechanism of the nano&#8208;sized TeO2/C composite is newly revealed and unambiguously verified.







Abstract
The electrochemical reactions for the storage of Zn2+ while embracing more electron transfer is a foundation of the future high&#8208;energy aqueous zinc batteries. Herein, we report a six&#8208;electron transfer electrochemistry of nano&#8208;sized TeO2/C (n&#8208;TeO2/C) cathode by facilitating the reversible conversion of TeO2&#8596;Te and Te&#8596;ZnTe. Benefitting from the integrated conductive nanostructure and the proton&#8208;rich environment in providing optimized electrochemical kinetics (facilitated Zn2+ uptake and high electronic conductivity) and feasible thermodynamic process (low Gibbs free energy change), the as&#8208;prepared n&#8208;TeO2/C with stable cycling performance exhibits a superior reversible capacity of over 800&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. A precise understanding of the reaction mechanism via ex situ and in situ characterizations presents that the reversible six&#8208;electron transfer reaction is proton&#8208;dependent, and a proton generating and consuming mechanism of three&#8208;phase conversion n&#8208;TeO2/C in the weakly acidic electrolyte is thoroughly revealed.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of a Stable Nickelocenium Dication Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and isolation of the first parent metallocene dication is reported. Nickelocene was twice deelectronated, i.e. single&#8208;electron oxidized, by [NO]+ in 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene. The [NiCp2]+ and [NiCp2]2+ cations were isolated as their [F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; salts and were fully characterized by NMR, CV and XRD analysis.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization of the nickelocenium cations [NiCp2]&#8901;+ and [NiCp2]2+ as their [F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; (Cp = C5H5; RF=C(CF3)3) salts. Diamagnetic [NiCp2]2+ represents the first example for the isolation of an unsubstituted parent metallocene dication. Both salts were generated by reacting neutral NiCp2 with [NO]+[F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; in 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene (4FB). The salts were characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), indicating shorter metal&#8208;ligand bond lengths for the higher charged salt. Powder XRD shows the salts to be phase pure, cyclic voltammetry in 4FB gave quasi reversible redox waves at &#8722;0.44 (0&#8594;1) and +1.17&#8197;V (1&#8594;2) vs Fc/Fc+. The 1H&#8197;NMR of [NiCp2]2+ is a singlet at 8.6&#8197;ppm, whereas paramagnetic [NiCp2]&#8901;+ is significantly shifted upfield to &#8722;103.1&#8197;ppm.

A pyridyl&#8208;tethered robust azomethine ylide thermally rearranges to a chelating cyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) by the mediacy of CuCl in an intriguing fashion. However, without the CuCl, it cyclizes to a chelating aziridine. Both are bidentate ligands giving cationic Rh(I) complexes that are highly active catalysts for olefin hydrosilylation. The aziridine&#8208;based catalyst was surprisingly found to show superior reactivity.







Abstract
Azomethine ylides are typically in situ generated synthons for making N&#8208;heterocycles through cycloaddition reactions. But an offbeat aspect about them is the isomeric nature of aldiminium&#8208;based azomethine ylides and (alkyl/aryl)(amino)carbenes, interconvertible by a formal 1,3&#8208;H+ transfer. Herein, two thermally robust azomethine ylides with a N&#8208;appended picolyl sidearm are isolated, which cyclize to pyaziridines at 80&#8201;&#176;C but unprecedentedly result N&#8722;picoCAAC&#8208;CuCl (CAAC=cyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbene) complexes when heated with CuCl at merely 60&#8201;&#176;C. The pendant Npy, as revealed by computational analysis, plays a crucial role in this unusual 1,3&#8208;H+ shift using a deprotonation&#8208;protonation sequence, as well as in placing the CuCl at the carbenic site in tandem. The softer nature of Cu(I) is also critical. Chelating CAACs are rare and one with a N&#8208;tethered additional donor is priorly unknown. Both N&#8208;picoCAAC and pyaziridine are bidentate chelators giving highly active cationic Rh(I) catalysts for hydrosilylating unactivated olefins by Et3SiH. Notably, the pyaziridine&#8208;Rh(I) is superior than the N&#8208;picoCAAC&#8208;Rh(I) catalyst.

         <title>Crystalline 2&#960; Aromatic Azadiboriridinylium: A BN Analogue of Cyclopropenylium Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first cationic boron&#8208;containing 2&#960; aromatic species, azadiboriridinylium cation, has been synthesized by the ring&#8208;contraction of a diboratriazole followed by the hydride abstraction. This compound undergoes ring&#8208;expansion reactions with unsaturated nitrogen molecules leading to the cationic 6&#960; aromatic triazadiborolidinylium as well as a B2N3C pentafulvene derivative.







Abstract
N&#8208;Substitution of a thermally unstable diboratriazole 1 with a trimethylsilyl group affords a remarkably stable diboratriazole derivative 2. Ring contraction of 2 with an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene accompanied by the release of N2 as well as 1,4&#8208;hydrogen shift affords a carbene&#8208;stabilized azadiboriridine 3. Abstraction of the H&#8722;B3mem hydride in 3 with methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate leads to the isolation of a hitherto unknown azadiboriridinylium 4, the first BN analogue of cyclopropenylium cation. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and computational studies confirmed the delocalization of &#960; electrons over the B2N three&#8208;membered ring, indicating the 2&#960; aromatic feature. Compound 4 undergoes ring expansion reactions with azobenzene and pyridazine to furnish triazadiborolidinylium species 5 and 6, the latter of which possesses a cationic B2N3 ring with a pronounced 6&#960; aromatic property. Moreover, the reaction of 4 with a diazo compound produces a cationic B2N3C pentafulvene derivative 7.

         <title>Bayesian Optimization&#8208;guided Discovery of High&#8208;performance Methane Combustion Catalysts based on Multi&#8208;component PtPd@CeZrOx Core&#8211;Shell Nanospheres</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bayesian optimization has been successfully employed to accelerate discovery of the high&#8208;performance multi&#8208;component PtPd@CeZrOx core&#8211;shell nanospheres for catalytic CH4 combustion. The target T50 could reach a minimum after only two iterations, and the workload can be greatly reduced from thousands to as few as 18&#8197;experiments.







Abstract
Formula regulation of multi&#8208;component catalysts by manual search is undoubtedly a time&#8208;consuming task, which has severely impeded the development efficiency of high&#8208;performance catalysts. In this work, PtPd@CeZrOx core&#8211;shell nanospheres, as a successful case study, is explicitly demonstrated how Bayesian optimization (BO) accelerates the discovery of methane combustion catalysts with the optimal formula ratio (the Pt/Pd mole ratio ranges from 1/2.33&#8211;1/9.09, and Ce/Zr from 1/0.22&#8211;1/0.35), which directly results in a lower conversion temperature (T50 approaching to 330&#8201;&#176;C) than ones reported hitherto. Consequently, the best sample obtained could be efficiently developed after two rounds of iterations, containing only 18&#8197;experiments in all that is far less than the common human workload via the traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error search for optimal compositions. Further, this BO&#8208;based machine learning strategy can be straightforward extended to serve the autonomous discovery in multi&#8208;component material systems, for other desired properties, showing promising opportunities to practical applications in future.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective Kinetic C&#8722;H Olefination and Allylation for the Synthesis of C&#8722;B Axial Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H olefination and allylation reaction of 1,2&#8208;benzazaborines was developed, which allows to achieve a kinetic resolution of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;benzazaborines representing a straightforward route to construct C&#8722;B axial chirality. Two kinds of C&#8722;B axially chiral 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;benzazaborines are then readily diversified into a range of chiral intermediates, as well as transformed into potential chiral ligand.







Abstract
The direct C&#8722;H functionalization of 1,2&#8208;benzazaborines, especially asymmetric version, remains a great challenge. Here we report a palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H olefination and allylation reactions of 1,2&#8208;benzazaborines. This asymmetric approach is a kinetic resolution (KR), providing various C&#8722;B axially chiral 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;benzazaborines and 3&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;benzazaborines in generally high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (selectivity (S) factor up to 354). The synthetic potential of this reaction is showcased by late&#8208;stage modification of complex molecules, scale&#8208;up reaction, and applications.

The fast H3O+ insertion/extraction reaction of the diquinoxalino [2,3&#8208;a:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;c] phenazine (HATN) electrode endows the HATN//MnO2@GF hydronium&#8208;ion battery with superior performances.







Abstract
Hydronium&#8208;ion batteries have received significant attention owing to the merits of extraordinary sustainability and excellent rate abilities. However, achieving high&#8208;performance hydronium&#8208;ion batteries remains a challenge due to the inferior properties of anode materials in strong acid electrolyte. Herein, a hydronium&#8208;ion battery is constructed which is based on a diquinoxalino [2,3&#8208;a:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;c] phenazine (HATN) anode and a MnO2@graphite felt cathode in a hybrid acidic electrolyte. The fast kinetics of hydronium&#8208;ion insertion/extraction into HATN electrode endows the HATN//MnO2@GF battery with enhanced electrochemical performance. This battery exhibits an excellent rate performance (266&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, 97&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 50&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), attractive energy density (182.1&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) and power density (31.2&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1), along with long&#8208;term cycle stability. These results shed light on the development of advanced hydronium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Synthesis of Heptagon&#8208;Containing Polyarenes by Catalytic C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report an efficient synthetic method, involving a Pd&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular coupling, for polycyclic aromatic compounds containing seven&#8208;membered rings. A variety of heptagon&#8208;containing molecular nanocarbons were synthesized. In addition, a one&#8208;pot synthetic method comprising Rh&#8208;catalyzed annulation and Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclization was developed. Furthermore, it was possible to construct two seven&#8208;membered rings simultaneously.







Abstract
Nanocarbons incorporating non&#8208;hexagonal aromatic rings &#8208; such as five&#8208;, seven&#8208;, and eight&#8208;membered rings &#8208; have various intriguing physical properties such as curved structures, unique one&#8208;dimensional packing, and promising magnetic, optical, and conductivity properties. Herein, we report an efficient synthetic approach to polycyclic aromatics containing seven&#8208;membered rings via a palladium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular Ar&#8722;H/Ar&#8722;Br coupling. In addition to all&#8208;hydrocarbon scaffolds, heteroatom&#8208;embedded heptagon&#8208;containing polyarenes can be efficiently constructed with this method. Rhodium&#8208; and palladium&#8208;catalyzed sequential six&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered ring formations also afford complex heptagon&#8208;containing molecular nanocarbons from readily available arylacetylenes and biphenyl boronic acids. Detailed mechanistic analysis by DFT calculations showed the feasibility of seven&#8208;membered ring formation by a concerted metalation&#8208;deprotonation mechanism. This reaction can serve as a template for the synthesis of a wide range of seven&#8208;membered ring&#8208;containing molecular nanocarbons.

         <title>A Homochiral Fulgide Organic Ferroelectric Crystal with Photoinduced Molecular Orbital Breaking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homochiral organic fulgide ferroelectric crystal was synthesized that showed a photoinduced reversible change in its molecular orbitals between its open&#8208;ring and closed&#8208;ring isomers. This behavior is significantly distinct from the thermally triggered spatial symmetry breaking in traditional ferroelectrics and enables reversible switching of ferroelectric domains by optical manipulation.







Abstract
Thermally triggered spatial symmetry breaking in traditional ferroelectrics has been extensively studied for manipulation of the ferroelectricity. However, photoinduced molecular orbital breaking, which is promising for optical control of ferroelectric polarization, has been rarely explored. Herein, for the first time, we synthesized a homochiral fulgide organic ferroelectric crystal (E)&#8208;(R)&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;cyclohexylidene&#8208;4&#8208;(diphenylmethylene)dihydro&#8208;2,5&#8208;furandione (1), which exhibits both ferroelectricity and photoisomerization. Significantly, 1 shows a photoinduced reversible change in its molecular orbitals from the 3&#8197;&#960; molecular orbitals in the open&#8208;ring isomer to 2&#8197;&#960; and 1&#8197;&#963; molecular orbitals in the closed&#8208;ring isomer, which enables reversible ferroelectric domain switching by optical manipulation. To our knowledge, this is the first report revealing the manipulation of ferroelectric polarization in homochiral ferroelectric crystal by photoinduced breaking of molecular orbitals. This finding sheds light on the exploration of molecular orbital breaking in ferroelectrics for optical manipulation of ferroelectricity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thermally triggered spatial symmetry breaking in traditional ferroelectrics has been extensively studied for manipulation of the ferroelectricity. However, photoinduced molecular orbital breaking, which is promising for optical control of ferroelectric polarization, has been rarely explored. Herein, for the first time, we synthesized a homochiral fulgide organic ferroelectric crystal (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-(&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-3-methyl-3-cyclohexylidene-4-(diphenylmethylene)dihydro-2,5-furandione (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), which exhibits both ferroelectricity and photoisomerization. Significantly, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; shows a photoinduced reversible change in its molecular orbitals from the 3&#8197;&#960; molecular orbitals in the open-ring isomer to 2&#8197;&#960; and 1&#8197;&#963; molecular orbitals in the closed-ring isomer, which enables reversible ferroelectric domain switching by optical manipulation. To our knowledge, this is the first report revealing the manipulation of ferroelectric polarization in homochiral ferroelectric crystal by photoinduced breaking of molecular orbitals. This finding sheds light on the exploration of molecular orbital breaking in ferroelectrics for optical manipulation of ferroelectricity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Rotors: Fluorescent Sensors for Microviscosity and Conformation of Biomolecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we describe recent advances in the development of fluorescence&#8208;based viscosity sensors, termed Molecular Rotors, and discuss how these dyes can be exploited to quantify the microviscosity of biological environment, probe lipid membranes and non&#8208;canonical nucleic acid architectures and track dynamic processes, including protein aggregation.







Abstract
The viscosity and crowding of biological environment are considered vital for the correct cellular function, and alterations in these parameters are known to underly a number of pathologies including diabetes, malaria, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, to name a few. Over the last decades, fluorescent molecular probes termed molecular rotors proved extremely useful for exploring viscosity, crowding, and underlying molecular interactions in biologically relevant settings. In this review, we will discuss the basic principles underpinning the functionality of these probes and will review advances in their use as sensors for lipid order, protein crowding and conformation, temperature and non&#8208;canonical nucleic acid structures in live cells and other relevant biological settings.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Peptides ADP&#8208;Ribosylated at Histidine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the preparation of ribofuranosylated Fmoc&#8208;histidine building blocks via a Mukaiyama&#8208;type glycosylation. These building blocks were used in solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis, followed by on&#8208;resin pyrophosphate construction and deprotection to access peptides containing N(&#964;)&#8208; and N(&#960;)&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated histidine. The N&#8208;glycosidic linkage proved stable to the treatment with aqueous acid and base and resistant to (ADP&#8208;ribosyl)hydrolases.







Abstract
The transfer of an adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribose moiety to a nucleophilic side chain by consumption of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is referred to as ADP&#8208;ribosylation, which allows for the spatiotemporal regulation of vital processes such as apoptosis and DNA repair. Recent mass&#8208;spectrometry based analyses of the &#8220;ADP&#8208;ribosylome&#8221; have identified histidine as ADP&#8208;ribose acceptor site. In order to study this modification, a fully synthetic strategy towards &#945;&#8208;configured N(&#964;)&#8208; and N(&#960;)&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated histidine&#8208;containing peptides has been developed. Ribofuranosylated histidine building blocks were obtained via Mukaiyama&#8208;type glycosylation and the building blocks were integrated into an ADP&#8208;ribosylome derived peptide sequence using fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc)&#8208;based solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. On&#8208;resin installation of the ADP moiety was achieved using phosphoramidite chemistry, and global deprotection provided the desired ADP&#8208;ribosylated oligopeptides. The stability under various chemical conditions and resistance against (ADP&#8208;ribosyl) hydrolase&#8208;mediated degradation has been investigated to reveal that the constructs are stable under various chemical conditions and non&#8208;degradable by any of the known ADP&#8208;ribosylhydrolases.

         <title>Synthesis of 2&#8208;Azanorbornanes via Strain&#8208;Release Formal Cycloadditions Initiated by Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategies to prepare 2&#8208;azanorbornanes by photochemical strain&#8208;release formal cycloadditions is presented. The method involves the combination of azahousanes or housanes with alkenes or imines, respectively. The 2&#8208;azanorbornanes have defined exit vectors and represent new building blocks to enable drug development. The synthetic utilty of the products is also demonstrated.







Abstract
Rigid bicycles are becoming more popular in the pharmaceutical industry because they allow for expansion to new and unique chemical spaces. This work describes a new strategy to construct 2&#8208;azanorbornanes, which can act as rigid piperidine/pyrrolidine scaffolds with well&#8208;defined exit vectors. To achieve the synthesis of 2&#8208;azanorbornanes, new strain&#8208;release reagent, azahousane, is introduced along with its photosensitized strain&#8208;release formal cycloaddition with alkenes. Furthermore, new reactivity between a housane and an imine is disclosed. Both strategies lead to various substituted 2&#8208;azanorbornanes with good selectivities.

         <title>Clean Synthetic Strategies to Biologically Active Molecules from Lignin: A Green Path to Drug Discovery
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sustainable strategies inspired by the innate structural features of lignin were developed for the synthesis of diverse biologically active compounds, including tetrahydroisoquinolines, quinazolinones, dopamine and the natural product tetrahydropapaveroline. The synthetic approach enabled the rapid assessment of relevant biological activities through in vitro and in vivo studies and computational similarity searches, with multiple promising hits identified.







Abstract
Deriving active pharmaceutical agents from renewable resources is crucial to increasing the economic feasibility of modern biorefineries and promises to alleviate critical supply&#8208;chain dependencies in pharma manufacturing. Our multidisciplinary approach combines research in lignin&#8208;first biorefining, sustainable catalysis, and alternative solvents with bioactivity screening, an in vivo efficacy study, and a structural&#8208;similarity search. The resulting sustainable path to novel anti&#8208;infective, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and anticancer molecules enabled the rapid identification of frontrunners for key therapeutic indications, including an anti&#8208;infective against the priority pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae with efficacy in vivo and promising plasma and metabolic stability. Our catalytic methods provided straightforward access, inspired by the innate structural features of lignin, to synthetically challenging biologically active molecules with the core structure of dopamine, namely, tetrahydroisoquinolines, quinazolinones, 3&#8208;arylindoles and the natural product tetrahydropapaveroline. Our diverse array of atom&#8208;economic transformations produces only harmless side products and uses benign reaction media, such as tunable deep eutectic solvents for modulating reactivity in challenging cyclization steps.

         <title>Surface Termination on Unstable Methylammonium&#8208;based Perovskite Using a Steric Barrier for Improved Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface termination can passivate perovskite films and avoid the degradation of low&#8208;dimensional/three&#8208;dimensional (LD/3D) heterojunctions, but it's difficult to realize surface termination to hybrid perovskites due to the fast cation exchange. Here, a benzyltrimethylammonium cation with rational designed steric barrier can effectively surface terminate methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) with a wide processing window and enhanced stability.







Abstract
Compared to widely adopted low&#8208;dimensional/three&#8208;dimensional (LD/3D) heterostructure, functional organic cation based surface termination on perovskite can not only realize advantage of defect passivation but also prevent potential disadvantage of the heterostructure induced intercalation into 3D perovskite. However, it is still very challenging to controllably construct surface termination on organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite because the functional organic cations&#8217; substitution reaction is easy to form LD/3D heterostructure. Here, we report using a novel benzyltrimethylammonium (BTA) functional cation with rational designed steric hindrance to effectively surface terminate onto methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) perovskite, which is composed of the most unstable MA cations. The BTA cation is difficult to form a specific 1.5&#8208;dimensional perovskite of BTA4Pb3I10 by cation substitution with MA cation, which then provides a wide processing window (around 10&#8197;minutes) for surface terminating on MAPbI3 films. Moreover, the BTAI surface terminated BTAI&#8208;MAPbI3 shows better passivation effect than BTA4Pb3I10&#8208;MAPbI3 heterojunction. Finally, BTAI surface terminated solar cell (0.085&#8197;cm2) and mini&#8208;module (11.52&#8197;cm2) obtained the efficiencies of 22.03&#8201;% and 18.57&#8201;%, which are among the highest efficiencies for MAPbI3 based ones.

Here, we report using a novel benzyltrimethylammonium (BTA) functional cation with rational designed steric hindrance to effectively surface terminate onto methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) perovskite, which is composed of the most unstable MA cations. The BTA cation is difficult to form a specific 1.5-dimensional perovskite of BTA&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; by cation substitution with MA cation, which then provides a wide processing window (around 10&#8197;minutes) for surface terminating on MAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; films. Moreover, the BTAI surface terminated BTAI-MAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; shows better passivation effect than BTA&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;-MAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; heterojunction. Finally, BTAI surface terminated solar cell (0.085&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and mini-module (11.52&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) obtained the efficiencies of 22.03&#8201;% and 18.57&#8201;%, which are among the highest efficiencies for MAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; based ones.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A DNA Origami&#8208;Based Gene Editing System for Efficient Gene Therapy in Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA nanostructures have been widely developed as the smart drug delivery systems. Herein, a DNA origami with precisely organized PAM&#8208;rich region on its surface has been constructed to efficiently recruit and load sgRNA/Cas9 complex by PAM&#8208;guided assembly and pre&#8208;designed DNA/RNA hybridization for targeted gene editing of tumor&#8208;associated gene. This DNA origami&#8208;based gene editing system has achieved a pronounced gene therapy in vivo.







Abstract
DNA nanostructures have played an important role in the development of novel drug delivery systems. Herein, we report a DNA origami&#8208;based CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system for efficient gene therapy in vivo. In our design, a PAM&#8208;rich region precisely organized on the surface of DNA origami can easily recruit and load sgRNA/Cas9 complex by PAM&#8208;guided assembly and pre&#8208;designed DNA/RNA hybridization. After loading the sgRNA/Cas9 complex, the DNA origami can be further rolled up by the locking strands with a disulfide bond. With the incorporation of DNA aptamer and influenza hemagglutinin (HA) peptide, the cargo&#8208;loaded DNA origami can realize the targeted delivery and effective endosomal escape. After reduction by GSH, the opened DNA origami can release the sgRNA/Cas9 complex by RNase H cleavage to achieve a pronounced gene editing of a tumor&#8208;associated gene for gene therapy in vivo. This rationally developed DNA origami&#8208;based gene editing system presents a new avenue for the development of gene therapy.

         <title>A Mechanistic Understanding of the Distinct Regio&#8208; and Chemoselectivity of Multifunctional P450s by Structural Comparison of IkaD and CftA Complexed with Common Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystal structures of the homologous cytochrome P450 enzymes IkaD and CftA complexed with the natural substrate ikarugamycin reveal that their regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity are controlled by the distinct conformations of the F/G region in IkaD and CftA, which differentiate the substrate orientation and cause distinct binding patterns with the polar moieties of substrates. Fine&#8208;tuning the polar subpocket of IkaD can alter the regioselectivity.







Abstract
Regio&#8208; and chemoselective C&#8722;H activation at multi&#8208;positions of a single molecule is fascinating but chemically challenging. The homologous cytochrome P450 enzymes IkaD and CftA catalyze multiple C&#8722;H oxidations on the same polycyclic tetramate macrolactam (PoTeM) ikarugamycin, with distinct regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity. Herein we provide mechanistic understanding of their functional differences by solving crystal structures of IkaD and CftA in complex with ikarugamycin and unnatural substrates. Distinct conformations of the F/G region in IkaD and CftA are found to differentiate the orientation of PoTeM substrates, by causing different binding patterns with polar moieties to determine site selection, oxidation order, and chemoselectivity. Fine&#8208;tuning the polar subpocket altered the regioselectivity of IkaD, indicating that substrate re&#8208;orientation by mutating residues distal to the oxidation site could serve as an important method in future engineering of P450 enzymes.

         <title>Aluminum(III) Cations [(NHC)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;ArMes2]+: Synthesis, Characterization, and Application in FLP&#8208;Chemistry</title>

         <dc:description>
Rare examples of three&#8208;coordinate aluminum cations of the form [(NHC)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlMes2]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722; and their etherate analogues [(NHC)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlMes2(OEt2)]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722;are presented. The Lewis&#8208;acidity of the cations was evaluated theoretically and experimentally to be very high. These cationic Lewis&#8208;acids form a frustrated Lewis&#8208;pair (FLP) upon addition of the phosphine PCy3, which reacts with small molecules such as CO2, ethene, and 2&#8208;butyne.







Abstract
The three&#8208;coordinate aluminum cations ligated by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) [(NHC)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlMes2]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722; (NHC=IMeMe 4, IiPrMe 5, IiPr 6, Mes=2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl) were prepared via hydride abstraction of the alanes (NHC)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlHMes2 (NHC=IMeMe 1, IiPrMe 2, IiPr 3) using [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722; in toluene as hydride acceptor. If this reaction was performed in diethyl ether, the corresponding four&#8208;coordinate aluminum etherate cations [(NHC)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlMes2(OEt2)]+ [B(C6F5)4]&#8722; 7&#8211;9 (NHC=IMeMe 7, IiPrMe 8, IiPr 9) were isolated. According to a theoretical and experimental assessment of the Lewis&#8208;acidity of the [(IMeMe)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlMes2]+ cation is the acidity larger than that of B(C6F5)3 and of similar magnitude as reported for Al(C6F5)3. The reaction of [(IMeMe)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlMes2]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722; 4 with the sterically less demanding, basic phosphine PMe3 afforded a mixed NHC/phosphine stabilized cation [(IMeMe)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlMes2(PMe3)]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722; 10. Equimolar mixtures of 4 and the sterically more demanding PCy3 gave a frustrated Lewis&#8208;pair (FLP), i.e., [(IMeMe)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlMes2]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722;/PCy3 FLP&#8208;11, which reacts with small molecules such as CO2, ethene, and 2&#8208;butyne.

         <title>On the Origin of the Non&#8208;Arrhenius Na&#8208;ion Conductivity in Na3OBr</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poorly crystalline impurities consisting of Na2O, Na2O2, and NaOH were detected in Na3OBr antiperovskite synthesised with commercially available Na2O. These impurities form a eutectic mixture which melts at around 250&#8201;&#176;C, reducing the activation energy for Na+ conduction from 0.47&#8197;eV to 0.43&#8197;eV.







Abstract
The sodium&#8208;rich antiperovskites (NaRAPs) with composition Na3OB (B=Br, Cl, I, BH4, etc.) are a family of materials that has recently attracted great interest for application as solid electrolytes in sodium metal batteries. Non&#8208;Arrhenius ionic conductivities have been reported for these materials, the origin of which is poorly understood. In this work, we combined temperature&#8208;resolved bulk and local characterisation methods to gain an insight into the origin of this unusual behaviour using Na3OBr as a model system. We first excluded crystallographic disorder on the anion sites as the cause of the change in activation energy; then identified the presence of a poorly crystalline impurities, not detectable by XRD, and elucidated their effect on ionic conductivity. These findings improve understanding of the processing&#8208;structure&#8208;properties relationships pertaining to NaRAPs and highlight the need to determine these relationships in other materials systems, which will accelerate the development of high&#8208;performance solid electrolytes.

         <title>1&#8208;Azaspiro[3.3]heptane as a Bioisostere of Piperidine
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1&#8208;Azaspiro[3.3]heptanes were synthesized, characterized, and validated biologically as bioisosteres of piperidine. Incorporation of this core into the anesthetic drug bupivacaine instead of the piperidine ring resulted in a patent&#8208;free analogue with high activity.







Abstract
1&#8208;Azaspiro[3.3]heptanes were synthesized, characterized, and validated biologically as bioisosteres of piperidine. The key synthesis step was thermal [2+2] cycloaddition between endocyclic alkenes and the Graf isocyanate, ClO2S&#8722;NCO, to give spirocyclic &#946;&#8208;lactams. Reduction of the &#946;&#8208;lactam ring with alane produced 1&#8208;azaspiro[3.3]heptanes. Incorporation of this core into the anesthetic drug bupivacaine instead of the piperidine fragment resulted in a new patent&#8208;free analogue with high activity.

         <title>Non&#8208;native Intramolecular Radical Cyclization Catalyzed by a B12&#8208;Dependent Enzyme
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A B12&#8208;dependent enzyme, CarH*, was engineered that can efficiently catalyze the radical cyclization of halide substrates containing a pendant olefin or alkyne, enabling the synthesis of a series of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorinated lactams. Additionally, CarH* displayed an intriguing ability to mediate reductive dearomative spirocyclization of substrates with aromatic acceptors to generate spirobicycles, featuring uncommon 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene selectivity.







Abstract
Despite the unique reactivity of vitamin B12 and its derivatives, B12&#8208;dependent enzymes remain underutilized in biocatalysis. In this study, we repurposed the B12&#8208;dependent transcription factor CarH to enable non&#8208;native radical cyclization reactions. An engineered variant of this enzyme, CarH*, catalyzes the formation &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;lactams through either redox&#8208;neutral or reductive ring closure with marked enhancement of reactivity and selectivity relative to the free B12 cofactor. CarH* also catalyzes an unusual spirocyclization by dearomatization of pendant arenes to produce bicyclic 1,3&#8208;diene products instead of 1,4&#8208;dienes provided by existing methods. These results and associated mechanistic studies highlight the importance of protein scaffolds for controlling the reactivity of B12 and expanding the synthetic utility of B12&#8208;dependent enzymes.

         <title>Chemical Proteomic Discovery of Isotype&#8208;Selective Covalent Inhibitors of the RNA Methyltransferase NSUN2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activity&#8208;based protein profiling identifies azetidine acrylamides that covalently inhibit the RNA methyltransferase NSUN2 through targeting a conserved catalytic cysteine. The azetidine acrylamides show high isotype selectivity and perturb NSUN2&#8208;tRNA interactions and the 5&#8208;methylcytosine (m5C) content of RNA in cancer cells.







Abstract
5&#8208;Methylcytosine (m5C) is an RNA modification prevalent on tRNAs, where it can protect tRNAs from endonucleolytic cleavage to maintain protein synthesis. The NSUN family (NSUN1&#8208;7 in humans) of RNA methyltransferases are capable of installing the methyl group onto the C5 position of cytosines in RNA. NSUNs are implicated in a wide range of (patho)physiological processes, but selective and cell&#8208;active inhibitors of these enzymes are lacking. Here, we use cysteine&#8208;directed activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP) to discover azetidine acrylamides that act as stereoselective covalent inhibitors of human NSUN2. Despite targeting a conserved catalytic cysteine in the NSUN family, the NSUN2 inhibitors show negligible cross&#8208;reactivity with other human NSUNs and exhibit good proteome&#8208;wide selectivity. We verify that the azetidine acrylamides inhibit the catalytic activity of recombinant NSUN2, but not NSUN6, and demonstrate that these compounds stereoselectively disrupt NSUN2&#8208;tRNA interactions in cancer cells, leading to a global reduction in tRNA m5C content. Our findings thus highlight the potential to create isotype&#8208;selective and cell&#8208;active inhibitors of NSUN2 with covalent chemistry targeting a conserved catalytic cysteine.

         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Assembly of DNA Origami into Dissipative Fibrils</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We build hierarchical DNA origami fibrils using protonated DNA strands. By employing a small molecule that releases protons during irradiation, our system is activated by light and is assembled under dissipative conditions. Generating no waste, our fibrils can be built and demolished multiple times, underscoring the utility of pH&#8208;responsive, non&#8208;canonical DNA motifs for out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium assembly.







Abstract
Hierarchical DNA nanostructures offer programmable functions at scale, but making these structures dynamic, while keeping individual components intact, is challenging. Here we show that the DNA A&#8208;motif&#8212;protonated, self&#8208;complementary poly(adenine) sequences&#8212;can propagate DNA origami into one&#8208;dimensional, micron&#8208;length fibrils. When coupled to a small molecule pH regulator, visible light can activate the hierarchical assembly of our DNA origami into dissipative fibrils. This system is recyclable and does not require DNA modification. By employing a modular and waste&#8208;free strategy to assemble and disassemble hierarchical structures built from DNA origami, we offer a facile and accessible route to developing well&#8208;defined, dynamic, and large DNA assemblies with temporal control. As a general tool, we envision that coupling the A&#8208;motif to cycles of dissipative protonation will allow the transient construction of diverse DNA nanostructures, finding broad applications in dynamic and non&#8208;equilibrium nanotechnology.

A strategy of tailoring dynamic covalent bonds with a low rotational energy barrier was proposed to fabricate phosphate&#8208;derived Diels&#8211;Alder crosslinked recyclable thermosets and their composites, simultaneously overcoming the trade&#8208;off between recycling efficiency and comprehensive properties in current covalent adaptable materials and offering a guidance for the rational design of sustainable thermosetting polymers for versatile applications.







Abstract
Although a variety of dynamic covalent bonds have been successfully used in the development of diverse sustainable thermosetting polymers and their composites, solving the trade&#8208;off between recovery efficiency and comprehensive properties is still a major challenge. Herein, a &#8220;one&#8208;stone&#8208;two&#8208;birds&#8221; strategy of lower rotational energy barrier (Er) phosphate&#8208;derived Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) cycloadditions was proposed for easily recyclable carbon fiber (CF)&#8208;reinforced epoxy resins (EPs) composites. In such a strategy, the phosphate spacer with lower Er accelerated the segmental mobility and dynamic DA exchange reaction for network rearrangement to achieve high&#8208;efficiency repairing, reprocessing of the EPs matrix and its composites and rapid nondestructive recycling of CF; meanwhile, incorporating phosphorus&#8208;based units especially reduced their fire hazards. The resulting materials simultaneously showed excellent thermal/mechanical properties, superb fire safety and facile recyclability, realizing the concept of recycling for high&#8208;performance thermosetting polymers and composites. This strategy is of great significance for understanding and enriching the molecular connotation of DA chemistry, making it potentially applicable to the design and development of a wide range of dynamic covalent adaptable materials toward practical cutting&#8208;edge&#8208;tech applications.

         <title>A Colorimetric Biosensing Platform with Aptamers, Rolling Circle Amplification and Urease&#8208;Mediated Litmus Test</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sensitive and simple&#8208;to&#8208;use colorimetric sensors are highly desirable for point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostic applications. Here we report on an ultra&#8208;sensitive colorimetric sensing platform that takes advantage of both the strong amplification power of rolling circle amplification and the high efficiency of a urease&#8208;mediated litmus test. By using aptamers for target recognition, this platform can be adapted for a wide range of sensing applications.







Abstract
Here we report on an ultra&#8208;sensitive colorimetric sensing platform that takes advantage of both the strong amplification power of rolling circle amplification (RCA) and the high efficiency of a simple urease&#8208;mediated litmus test. The presence of a target triggers the RCA reaction, and urease&#8208;labelled DNA can hybridize to the biotinylated RCA products and be immobilized onto streptavidin&#8208;coated magnetic beads. The urease&#8208;laden beads are then used to hydrolyze urea, leading to an increase in pH that can be detected by a simple litmus test. We show this sensing platform can be easily integrated with aptamers for sensing diverse targets via the detection of human thrombin and platelet&#8208;derived growth factor (PDGF) utilizing structure&#8208;switching aptamers as well as SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 in human saliva using a spike&#8208;binding trimeric DNA aptamer. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this colorimetric sensing platform can be integrated into a simple paper&#8208;based device for sensing applications.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Enantiomer Emitter Enabled Superstructural Helix Inversion for Upconverting and Downshifting Luminescence with Bidirectional Circular Polarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single chiral emitter can induce the reversal of the cholesteric helix direction at a macroscopic level through a concentration&#8208;dependent effect at the molecular scale. This exceptional capacity endows the system with the extraordinary ability to seamlessly toggle the sign of circularly polarized luminescence, thus bestowing unparalleled mastery over the upconversion/downshift processes associated with the donor and acceptor moieties. &#8220;A Single&#8208;Enantiomer Emitter Enabled Superstructural Helix Inversion for Upconverting and Downshifting Luminescence with Bidirectional Circular Polarization (Duan and Zhao).&#8221;







Abstract
The helical twisting tendency of liquid crystals (LCs) is generally governed by the inherent configuration of the chiral emitter. Here, we introduce the multistage inversion of supramolecular chirality as well as circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) by manipulating the ratio of single enantiomeric emitters (R&#8208;PCP) to LC monomers (5CB). Increasing the content of R&#8208;PCP from 1&#8197;wt&#8201;% to 3&#8197;wt&#8201;% inverted the helix of LCs from left&#8208;handed to right&#8208;handed, accompanying a CPL sign changed from positive to negative. The biaxiality of chiral emitters, as well as the steric effect of chiral&#8208;chiral and chiral&#8208;achiral interaction, were identified as the reasons for helical sense inversion. Due to the strong helical twisting power, 4&#8197;wt&#8201;% R&#8208;PCP drove the photonic band gap (PBG) of chiral LCs to match up with their emission range, leading to an inversion of the CPL again with a high dissymmetry factor (&#8776;1.2). Directly adjusting the PBG using chiral emitters is seldom achieved in cholesteric LCs. On this basis, an achiral sensitizer PtTPBP was assembled into the helical superstructure. The generation of triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation&#8208;induced upconverted CPL from R&#8208;PCP and the downshifting CPL from PtTPBP with opposite rotation was achieved in a single chiral LC system by tuning the position of the PBG.

         <title>Significant Roles of Surface Hydrides in Enhancing the Performance of Cu/BaTiO2.8H0.2 Catalyst for CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing hydrides into the lattice of BaTiO3 can notably enhance the methanol yield over a supported Cu catalyst in CO2 hydrogenation due to the direct participation of surface hydrides in the reaction and the modified electronic property of the interfacial sites in the Cu/ BaTiO2.8H0.2 catalyst.







Abstract
Tuning the anionic site of catalyst supports can impact reaction pathways by creating active sites on the support or influencing metal&#8208;support interactions when using supported metal nanoparticles. This study focuses on CO2 hydrogenation over supported Cu nanoparticles, revealing a 3&#8208;fold increase in methanol yield when replacing oxygen anions with hydrides in the perovskite support (Cu/BaTiO2.8H0.2 yields ~146&#8197;mg/h/gCu vs. Cu/BaTiO3 yields ~50&#8197;mg/h/gCu). The contrast suggests that significant roles are played by the support hydrides in the reaction. Temperature programmed reaction and isotopic labelling studies indicate that BaTiO2.8H0.2 surface hydride species follow a Mars van Krevelen mechanism in CO2 hydrogenation, promoting methanol production. High&#8208;pressure steady&#8208;state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) studies suggest that Cu/BaTiO2.8H0.2 possesses both a higher density and more active and selective sites for methanol production compared to Cu/BaTiO3. An operando high&#8208;pressure diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS)&#8208;SSITKA study shows that formate species are the major surface intermediates over both catalysts, and the subsequent hydrogenation steps of formate are likely rate&#8208;limiting. However, the catalytic reactivity of Cu/BaTiO2.8H0.2 towards the formate species is much higher than Cu/BaTiO3, likely due to the altered electronic structure of interface Cu sites by the hydrides in the support as validated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Glutathione Mediates Control of Dual Differential Bio&#8208;orthogonal Labelling of Biomolecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical modification at precise sites within biomolecules is essential to assist in understanding their function. The incorporation of bio&#8208;orthogonal reactive groups provides a strategy for selective tagging, however cross&#8208;reactivity is problematic when dual modification is required. Glutathione (GSH) is used to control the reactivity of ynamine and cyclooctyne reagents in sequential (3+2) cycloaddition reactions.







Abstract
Traditional approaches to bio&#8208;orthogonal reaction discovery have focused on developing reagent pairs that react with each other faster than they are metabolically degraded. Glutathione (GSH) is typically responsible for the deactivation of most bio&#8208;orthogonal reagents. Here we demonstrate that GSH promotes a Cu&#8208;catalysed (3+2) cycloaddition reaction between an ynamine and an azide. We show that GSH acts as a redox modulator to control the Cu oxidation state in these cycloadditions. Rate enhancement of this reaction is specific for ynamine substrates and is tuneable by the Cu:GSH ratio. This unique GSH&#8208;mediated reactivity gradient is then utilised in the dual sequential bio&#8208;orthogonal labelling of peptides and oligonucleotides via two distinct chemoselective (3+2) cycloadditions.

         <title>Electrochemical Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Inter&#8208; and Intramolecular Arylations of Cysteine&#8208;Containing Peptides
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical electrochemical Ni&#8208;catalytic system has been developed for selective (hetero)arylation, alkenylation and alkynylation of cysteine&#8208;containing peptides. The high functional group compatibility and application to the synthesis of cyclic peptides either by cyclization or stapling demonstrate the potential protocol's utility in medicinal chemistry and chemical biology.







Abstract
Here we report a simple electrochemical route towards the synthesis of S&#8208;arylated peptides by a site selective coupling of peptides with aryl halides under base free conditions. This approach demonstrates the power of electrochemistry to access both highly complex peptide conjugates and cyclic peptides.

         <title>Parallel Planar Heterojunction Strategy Enables Sb2S3 Solar Cells with Efficiency Exceeding 8&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An easily solution&#8208;processed parallel planar heterojunction (PPHJ) strategy boosts the efficiency of Sb2S3 solar cells up to 8.32&#8201;%, by integrating the distinctive structures of Sb2S3 layer and the duplexity of CH3NH3PbI3 layer in charge transportation. The PPHJ device consists of the conventional planar heterojunction (PHJ) subcells in a parallel connection, but eliminates the normal complexity in both tandem and parallel tandem PHJ systems.







Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed solar cells based on inorganic heterojunctions provide a potential approach to the efficient, stable and low&#8208;cost solar cells required for the terrestrial generation of photovoltaic energy. Antimony trisulfide (Sb2S3) is a promising photovoltaic absorber. Here, an easily solution&#8208;processed parallel planar heterojunction (PPHJ) strategy and related principle are developed to prepare efficient multiple planar heterojunction (PHJ) solar cells, and the PPHJ strategy boosts the efficiency of solution&#8208;processed Sb2S3 solar cells up to 8.32&#8201;% that is the highest amongst Sb2S3 devices. The Sb2S3&#8208;based PPHJ device consists of two kinds of conventional planar heterojunction (PHJ) subcells in a parallel connection: Sb2S3&#8208;based PHJ subcells dominating the absorption and charge generation and CH3NH3PbI3&#8208;based PHJ subcells governing the electron transport towards collection electrode, but it belongs to an Sb2S3 device in nature. The resulting PPHJ device combines together the distinctive structural features of Sb2S3 absorbing layer as a main absorber and the duplexity of well&#8208;crystallized/oriented CH3NH3PbI3 layer in charge transportation as an additional absorber, while the presence of perovskite does not affect device stability. The PPHJ strategy maintains the facile preparation by the conventional sequential depositions of multiple layers, but eliminates the normal complexity in both tandem and parallel tandem PHJ systems.

         <title>Selective CO2 Reduction to Ethylene Mediated by Adaptive Small&#8208;molecule Engineering of Copper&#8208;based Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through in situ tannic acid (TA) molecule regulating the reconstruction of a Cu&#8208;based material, CO2 reduction to C2H4 products with a Faraday efficiency (FE) of 63.6&#8201;% over 497.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was achieved. The excellent performance can be attributed to TA induced adaptive Cu&#948;+/Cu0 interface is beneficial to lower the energy barrier of C&#8722;C coupling, as well as the key COH intermediate stabilized through the hydrogen bond by the hydroxyl group in TA.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) over Cu catalysts exhibits enormous potential for efficiently converting CO2 to ethylene (C2H4). However, achieving high C2H4 selectivity remains a considerable challenge due to the propensity of Cu catalysts to undergo structural reconstruction during CO2RR. Herein, we report an in situ molecule modification strategy that involves tannic acid (TA) molecules adaptive regulating the reconstruction of a Cu&#8208;based material to a pathway that facilitates CO2 reduction to C2H4 products. An excellent Faraday efficiency (FE) of 63.6&#8201;% on C2H4 with a current density of 497.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in flow cell was achieved, about 6.5&#8197;times higher than the pristine Cu catalyst which mainly produce CH4. The in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and Raman studies reveal that the hydroxyl group in TA stabilizes Cu&#948;+ during the CO2RR. Furthermore, theoretical calculations demonstrate that the Cu&#948;+/Cu0 interfaces lower the activation energy barrier for *CO dimerization, and hydroxyl species stabilize the *COH intermediate via hydrogen bonding, thereby promoting C2H4 production. Such molecule engineering modulated electronic structure provides a promising strategy to achieve highly selective CO2 reduction to value&#8208;added chemicals.

         <title>Hydrogenation Catalysis by Hydrogen Spillover on Platinum&#8208;Functionalized Heterogeneous Boronic Acid&#8208;Polyoxometalates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular colloids based on polyoxometalates functionalized with boronic acids are modified with Pt particles to yield high&#8208;performance hydrogenation catalysts. Mechanistic studies reveal that the systems operate by a hydrogen spillover mechanism, enabling efficient hydrogenation of olefins to alkanes and nitroarenes to amines under mild conditions.







Abstract
The activation of molecular hydrogen is a key process in catalysis. Here, we demonstrate how polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based heterogeneous compounds functionalized with Platinum particles activate H2 by synergism between a hydrogen spillover mechanism and electron&#8208;proton transfer by the POM. This interplay facilitates the selective catalytic reduction of olefins and nitroarenes with high functional group tolerance. A family of polyoxotungstates covalently functionalized with boronic acids is reported. In the solid&#8208;state, the compounds are held together by non&#8208;covalent interactions (&#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and hydrogen bonding). The resulting heterogeneous nanoscale particles form stable colloidal dispersions in acetonitrile and can be surface&#8208;functionalized with platinum nanoparticles by in situ photoreduction. The resulting materials show excellent catalytic activity in hydrogenation of olefins and nitrobenzene derivatives under mild conditions (1&#8197;bar H2 and room temperature).

         <title>Chemical Imaging of RNA&#8208;Tau Amyloid Fibrils at the Nanoscale Using Tip&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) is used to map polyadenosine (polyA)&#8208;induced tau fibrils with nanoscale spatial resolution. It proves that polyA lies on the surface of the fibril core &#946;&#8208;sheets but remains wrapped by the random&#8208;coiled fuzzy coat. TERS also shows the colocalization of positively charged amino acids with the anionic polyA cofactor, which is an important step to clarify the role of RNA cofactors in the fibril formation.







Abstract
In the presence of cofactors, tau protein can form amyloid deposits in the brain which are implicated in many neurodegenerative disorders. Heparin, lipids, and RNA are used to recreate tau aggregates in vitro from recombinant protein. However, the mechanism of interaction of these cofactors and the interactions between cofactors and tau are poorly understood. Herein, we use tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) to visualize the spatial distribution of adenine, protein secondary structure, and amino acids (arginine, lysine and histidine) in single polyadenosine (polyA)&#8208;induced tau fibrils with nanoscale spatial resolution (&lt;10&#8211;20&#8197;nm). Based on reference unenhanced and surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectra, we show that the polyA anionic cofactor is incorporated in the fibril structure and seems to be superficial to the &#946;&#8208;sheet core, but nonetheless enveloped within the random&#8208;coiled fuzzy coat. TERS images also prove the colocalization of positively charged arginine, lysine, and histidine amino acids and negatively charged polyA, which constitutes an important step forward to better comprehend the action of RNA cofactors in the mechanism of formation of toxic tau fibrils.

&lt;p&gt;Tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) is used to map polyadenosine (polyA)-induced tau fibrils with nanoscale spatial resolution. It proves that polyA lies on the surface of the fibril core &#946;-sheets but remains wrapped by the random-coiled fuzzy coat. TERS also shows the colocalization of positively charged amino acids with the anionic polyA cofactor, which is an important step to clarify the role of RNA cofactors in the fibril formation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the presence of cofactors, tau protein can form amyloid deposits in the brain which are implicated in many neurodegenerative disorders. Heparin, lipids, and RNA are used to recreate tau aggregates in vitro from recombinant protein. However, the mechanism of interaction of these cofactors and the interactions between cofactors and tau are poorly understood. Herein, we use tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) to visualize the spatial distribution of adenine, protein secondary structure, and amino acids (arginine, lysine and histidine) in single polyadenosine (polyA)-induced tau fibrils with nanoscale spatial resolution (&amp;lt;10&#8211;20&#8197;nm). Based on reference unenhanced and surface-enhanced Raman spectra, we show that the polyA anionic cofactor is incorporated in the fibril structure and seems to be superficial to the &#946;-sheet core, but nonetheless enveloped within the random-coiled fuzzy coat. TERS images also prove the colocalization of positively charged arginine, lysine, and histidine amino acids and negatively charged polyA, which constitutes an important step forward to better comprehend the action of RNA cofactors in the mechanism of formation of toxic tau fibrils. TERS appears as a powerful technique for the identification of cofactors in individual tau fibrils and their mode of interaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Naphthyl Substituted Impurities Induce Efficient Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The origin of yellow&#8208;green room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) of triphenylamine from commercial sources has been clarified for the first time, which inspires a general and convenient approach to construct bicomponent host/guest organic RTP materials, that is, doping naphthyl substituted analogues into the host molecule.







Abstract
Accidentally, it was found that triphenylamine (TPA) from commercial sources shows ultralong yellow&#8208;green room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) like commercial carbazole, which however disappears for lab&#8208;synthesized TPA with high purity. Herein, we for the first time identify the impurity types that cause RTP of commercial TPA, which are two N, N&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;naphthylamine isomers. Due to similar molecular polarity and very trace amount (&#8776;0.8&#8197;&#8240;, molar ratio), these naphthyl substituted impurities can be easily overlooked. We further show that even at an extremely low amount (1000000&#8201;:&#8201;1, mass ratio) of impurities, RTP emission is still generated, attributed to the triplet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet energy transfer mechanism. Notably, this doping strategy is also applicable to the triphenylphosphine and benzophenone host systems, of which strong RTP emission can be activated by simply doping the corresponding naphthyl substituted analogues into them. This work therefore provides a general and efficient host/guest strategy toward high performance and diverse organic RTP materials.

         <title>Non&#8208;Interacting Ni and Fe Dual&#8208;Atom Pair Sites in N&#8208;Doped Carbon Catalysts for Efficient Concentrating Solar&#8208;Driven Photothermal CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni&#8722;Fe dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalyst (DSAC) with adjacent Ni&#8722;N4 and Fe&#8722;N4 pair sites was developed for concentrating solar&#8208;driven photothermal CO2 reduction. This work demonstrated that constructing an appropriate distance between Ni and Fe atoms via an N&#8208;bridged Ni&#8722;N&#8722;N&#8722;Fe configuration was conducive to the main *COOH and *HCO3 dissociation processes for solar&#8208;driven photothermal CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion under weak solar irradiation is generally difficult to meet the heat demand of CO2 reduction. Herein, a new concentrated solar&#8208;driven photothermal system coupling a dual&#8208;metal single&#8208;atom catalyst (DSAC) with adjacent Ni&#8722;N4 and Fe&#8722;N4 pair sites is designed for boosting gas&#8208;solid CO2 reduction with H2O under simulated solar irradiation, even under ambient sunlight. As expected, the (Ni, Fe)&#8722;N&#8722;C DSAC exhibits a superior photothermal catalytic performance for CO2 reduction to CO (86.16&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), CH4 (135.35&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and CH3OH (59.81&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), which are equivalent to 1.70&#8208;fold, 1.27&#8208;fold and 1.23&#8208;fold higher than those of the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst, respectively. Based on theoretical simulations, the Fermi level and d&#8208;band center of Fe atom is efficiently regulated in non&#8208;interacting Ni and Fe dual&#8208;atom pair sites with electronic interaction through electron orbital hybridization on (Ni, Fe)&#8722;N&#8722;C DSAC. Crucially, the distance between adjacent Ni and Fe atoms of the Ni&#8722;N&#8722;N&#8722;Fe configuration means that the additional Ni atom as a new active site contributes to the main *COOH and *HCO3 dissociation to optimize the corresponding energy barriers in the reaction process, leading to specific dual reaction pathways (COOH and HCO3 pathways) for solar&#8208;driven photothermal CO2 reduction to initial CO production.

         <title>Stability Investigations on a Pt@HGS Catalyst as a Model Material for Fuel Cell Applications: The Role of the Local pH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of the oxygen reduction reaction in accelerated stress tests using a Pt@HGS model catalyst on the catalyst degradation is investigated using RDE, IL&#8208;STEM grid and single entity electrochemical measurements. We demonstrate the importance of considering the modulation of the local pH when performing accelerated stress tests.







Abstract
Increasing the resistance of catalysts against electrochemical degradation is one of the key requirements for the wider use of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs). Here, we study the degradation of one entity of a highly stable catalyst, Pt@HGS, on a nanoelectrode under accelerated mass transport conditions. We find that the catalyst degrades more rapidly than expected based on previous ensemble measurements. Corroborated by identical location transmission electron microscopy and catalyst layer experiments, we deduce that locally different pH values are likely the reason for this difference in stability. Ultimately, this work provides insights into the actual conditions present in a PEMFC and raises questions about the applicability of accelerated stress tests usually performed to evaluate catalyst stability, particularly when they are performed in half&#8208;cell setups under inert gas.

         <title>Unravelling the Roles of Solvophobic Effects and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; Stacking Interactions in the Formation of [2]Catenanes Featuring Di&#8208;(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene) Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different effects have been shown to control the formation of [2]catenanes with different bridges between pyridine donors. The formation of [2&#8208;IL](OTf)4 is aided by solvophobic effects and [3&#8208;IL](OTf)4 is stabilized by solvophobic effects and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking. The &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking between the pyrene groups is essential for the formation of [4&#8208;IL](PF6)4 and [5&#8208;IL](PF6)4, where the enhanced stability of [5&#8208;IL](PF6)4 is based on the more stable Au&#8722;CNHC bonds.







Abstract
A series of [2]catenanes has been prepared from di&#8208;NHC building blocks by utilizing solvophobic effects and/or &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interactions. The dinickel naphthobiscarbene complex syn&#8208;[1] and the kinked biphenyl&#8208;bridged bipyridyl ligand L2 yield the [2]catenane [2&#8208;IL](OTf)4 by self&#8208;assembly. Solvophobic effects are pivotal for the formation of the interlocked species. Substitution of the biphenyl&#8208;linker in L2 for a pyromellitic diimide group gave ligand L3, which yielded in combination with syn&#8208;[1] the [2]catenane [3&#8208;IL](OTf)4. This assembly exhibits enhanced stability in diluted solution, aided by additional &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interactions. The &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking was augmented by the introduction of a pyrene bridge between two NHC donors in ligand L4. Di&#8208;NHC precursor H2&#8208;L4(PF6)2 reacts with Ag2O to give the [Ag2L42]2 [2]catenane [4&#8208;IL](PF6)4, which shows strong &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interactions between the pyrene groups. This assembly was readily converted into the [Au2L42]2 gold species [5&#8208;IL](PF6)4, which exhibits exceptional stability based on the strong &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interactions and the enhanced stability of the Au&#8208;CNHC bonds.

The dinickel naphthobiscarbene complex &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;-[&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;] and the kinked biphenyl-bridged bipyridyl ligand &lt;b&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; yield the [2]catenane [&lt;b&gt;2-IL&lt;/b&gt;](OTf)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; by self-assembly. Solvophobic effects are pivotal for the formation of the interlocked species. Substitution of the biphenyl-linker in &lt;b&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; for a pyromellitic diimide group gave ligand &lt;b&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, which yielded in combination with &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;-[&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;] the [2]catenane [&lt;b&gt;3-IL&lt;/b&gt;](OTf)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. This assembly exhibits enhanced stability in diluted solution, aided by additional &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interactions. The &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking was augmented by the introduction of a pyrene bridge between two NHC donors in ligand &lt;b&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;. Di-NHC precursor H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;b&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;(PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reacts with Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to give the [Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [2]catenane [&lt;b&gt;4-IL&lt;/b&gt;](PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, which shows strong &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interactions between the pyrene groups. This assembly was readily converted into the [Au&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gold species [&lt;b&gt;5-IL&lt;/b&gt;](PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, which exhibits exceptional stability based on the strong &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interactions and the enhanced stability of the Au-C&lt;sub&gt;NHC&lt;/sub&gt; bonds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solution&#8208;State 2D NMR Spectroscopy of Mixtures HyperpolarizedUsing Optically Polarized Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
HYPNOESYS (Hyperpolarized NOE System) has recently emerged as a promising approach to enhance the sensitivity of NMR spectroscopy in the solution state. We show that 2D NMR spectra can be obtained from HYPNOESYS&#8208;polarized samples, using single&#8208;scan acquisition methods, paving the way to a sensitive, information&#8208;rich and affordable analytical method.







Abstract
The HYPNOESYS method (Hyperpolarized NOE System), which relies on the dissolution of optically polarized crystals, has recently emerged as a promising approach to enhance the sensitivity of NMR spectroscopy in the solution state. However, HYPNOESYS is a single&#8208;shot method that is not generally compatible with multidimensional NMR. Here we show that 2D NMR spectra can be obtained from HYPNOESYS&#8208;polarized samples, using single&#8208;scan acquisition methods. The approach is illustrated with a mixture of terpene molecules and a benchtop NMR spectrometer, paving the way to a sensitive, information&#8208;rich and affordable analytical method.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Lithium Argyrodite Solid Electrolytes Enabling Stable All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>

Configurational entropy (compositional disorder in the anion sublattice) shows a direct correlation with ionic conductivity in lithium argyrodite superionic solid electrolytes.







Abstract
Superionic solid electrolytes (SEs) are essential for bulk&#8208;type solid&#8208;state battery (SSB) applications. Multicomponent SEs are recently attracting attention for their favorable charge&#8208;transport properties, however a thorough understanding of how configurational entropy (&#916;Sconf) affects ionic conductivity is lacking. Here, we successfully synthesized a series of halogen&#8208;rich lithium argyrodites with the general formula Li5.5PS4.5ClxBr1.5&#8208;x (0&#8804;x&#8804;1.5). Using neutron powder diffraction and 31P magic&#8208;angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the S2&#8722;/Cl&#8722;/Br&#8722; occupancy on the anion sublattice was quantitatively analyzed. We show that disorder positively affects Li&#8208;ion dynamics, leading to a room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of 22.7&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 (9.6&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 in cold&#8208;pressed state) for Li5.5PS4.5Cl0.8Br0.7 (&#916;Sconf=1.98R). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence that configurational entropy of the anion sublattice correlates with ion mobility. Our results indicate the possibility of improving ionic conductivity in ceramic ion conductors by tailoring the degree of compositional complexity. Moreover, the Li5.5PS4.5Cl0.8Br0.7 SE allowed for stable cycling of single&#8208;crystal LiNi0.9Co0.06Mn0.04O2 (s&#8208;NCM90) composite cathodes in SSB cells, emphasizing that dual&#8208;substituted lithium argyrodites hold great promise in enabling high&#8208;performance electrochemical energy storage.

         <title>Experimental and Computational Studies on Uranium Diazomethanediide Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this contribution, the synthesis, structure, and reactivity of metal (uranium) diazomethanediide complexes containing bridging and/or terminal isocyanoimido groups (U=NNC) are presented. By a combined experimental and computational study, unique reactivity patterns were identified and this gained knowledge provides the first insights into the reactivity of complexes containing a metal isocyanoimido (M=NNC) fragment.







Abstract
Uranium diazomethanediide complexes can be prepared and their synthesis, structure and reactivity were explored. Reaction of the uranium imido compound [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3Si)3C5H2]2U=N(p&#8208;tolyl)(dmap) (1) or [&#951;5&#8208;1,3&#8208;(Me3C)2C5H3]2U=N(p&#8208;tolyl)(dmap) (4) with Me3SiCHN2 cleanly yields the first isocyanoimido metal complexes [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3Si)3C5H2]2U(=NNC)(&#956;&#8208;CNN=)U(dmap)[&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3Si)3C5H2]2 (2) and {[&#951;5&#8208;1,3&#8208;(Me3C)2C5H3]2U[&#956;&#8208;(=NNC)]}6 (5), respectively. Both compounds exhibit remarkable thermal stability and were fully characterized. According to density functional theory (DFT) studies the bonding between the Cp2U2+ and [NNC]2&#8722; moieties is strongly polarized with a significant 5&#8201;f orbital contribution, which is also reflected in the reactivity of these complexes. For example, complex 5 acts as a nucleophile toward alkylsilyl halides and engages in a [2+2] cycloaddition with CS2, but no reaction occurs in the presence of internal alkynes.

         <title>Metal&#8208;DNA Nanocomplexes Enhance Chemo&#8208;dynamic Therapy by Inhibiting Autophagy&#8208;Mediated Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating multivalent nucleic acid aptamers and DNAzyme sequences into long single&#8208;stranded DNA and further forming metal&#8208;DNA nanocomplexes using rolling circle amplification (RCA) technology, researchers have successfully established a DNA drug delivery platform that combined chemo&#8208;dynamic therapy (CDT) and autophagy inhibition therapies. The platform overcame the shortcomings of short&#8208;stranded DNA, such as poor stability under physiological conditions, short blood circulation time, and easy clearance by the organism. The novel integration of aptamer and DNAzyme sequence achieved specific blockage of autophagy in tumor cells, weakened the resistance of cancer cells to CDT and successfully induced apoptosis in tumor cells.







Abstract
Chemo&#8208;dynamic therapy (CDT) based on the Fenton or Fenton&#8208;like reaction has emerged as a promising approach for cancer treatment. However, autophagy&#8208;mediated self&#8208;protection mechanisms of cancer cells pose a significant challenge to the efficacy of CDT. Herein, we developed metal&#8208;DNA nanocomplexes (DACs&#8208;Mn) to enhance CDT via DNAzyme inhibition of autophagy. Specifically, Mn&#8208;based catalyst in DACs&#8208;Mn was used to generate highly hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) that kill cancer cells, while the ATG5 DNAzyme incorporated into DACs&#8208;Mn inhibited the expression of autophagy&#8208;associated proteins, thereby improving the efficacy of CDT. By disrupting the self&#8208;protective pathway of cells under severe oxidative stress, this novel approach of DACs&#8208;Mn was found to synergistically enhance CDT in both in vitro and in vivo models, effectively amplifying tumor&#8208;specific oxidative damage. Notably, the Metal&#8208;DNA nanocomplexes can also induce immunogenic cell death (ICD), thereby inhibiting tumor metastasis. Specifically, in a bilateral tumor model in mice, the combined approach of CDT and autophagy inhibition followed by immune checkpoint blockade therapy shown significant potential as a novel and effective treatment modality for primary and metastatic tumors.

     alt="Metal-DNA Nanocomplexes Enhance Chemo-dynamic Therapy by Inhibiting Autophagy-Mediated Resistance"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By integrating multivalent nucleic acid aptamers and DNAzyme sequences into long single-stranded DNA and further forming metal-DNA nanocomplexes using rolling circle amplification (RCA) technology, researchers have successfully established a DNA drug delivery platform that combined chemo-dynamic therapy (CDT) and autophagy inhibition therapies. The platform overcame the shortcomings of short-stranded DNA, such as poor stability under physiological conditions, short blood circulation time, and easy clearance by the organism. The novel integration of aptamer and DNAzyme sequence achieved specific blockage of autophagy in tumor cells, weakened the resistance of cancer cells to CDT and successfully induced apoptosis in tumor cells.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Multiblock 1D Supramolecular Copolymers of Ir(III) Complexes with Controllable Sequences</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;component multiblock 1D supramolecular copolymers with up to 9 blocks have been successfully synthesized by precise control of the pathway complexity of Ir(III) complexes. The segmented structures of the multiblock copolymers could be characterized by both TEM and SEM. These three&#8208;component block copolymers with tunable block sequences will advance the development of functional block copolymers.







Abstract
Multicomponent supramolecular block copolymers (BCPs) have attracted much attention due to their potential functionalities, but examples of three&#8208;component supramolecular BCPs are rare. Herein, we report the synthesis of three&#8208;component multiblock 1D supramolecular copolymers of Ir(III) complexes 1&#8211;3 by a sequential seeded supramolecular polymerization approach. Precise control over the kinetically trapped species via the pathway complexity of the monomers is the key to the successful synthesis of BCPs with up to 9 blocks. Furthermore, 5&#8208;block BCPs with different sequences could be synthesized by changing the addition order of the kinetic species during a sequentially seeded process. The corresponding heterogeneous nucleation&#8208;elongation process has been confirmed by the UV/Vis absorption spectra, and each segment of the multiblock copolymers could be characterized by both TEM and SEM. Interestingly, the energy transfer leads to weakened emission of 1&#8208;terminated and enhanced emission of 3&#8208;terminated BCPs. This study will be an important step in advancing the synthesis and properties of three&#8208;component BCPs.

         <dc:description>
Cyclic azasilole derivatives undergo ring&#8208;opening with 18F&#8211; anions under mild conditions and with high radiochemical yield. They represent a novel class of Silicon Fluoride Acceptor systems (CycloSiFA) and hold great potential for convenient kit&#8208;like labelling procedures in different medicinal applications.

The latter constitutes a potential clickable CycloSiFA prosthetic group which might be used in PET tracer development using Cu&#8208;catalysed triazole formation. Based on our findings, CycloSiFA has the potential to become a new entry into non&#8208;canonical labelling methodologies for radioactive PET tracer development.

         <title>Boosting H+ Storage in Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries via Integrating Redox&#8208;Active Sites into Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks with Strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; Stacking</title>

         <dc:description>
We demonstrate the first case of applying redox&#8208;active hydrogen bonding organic framework with strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; interacting assembled from diaminotriazine moiety decorated hexaazatrinnphthalene as the cathode material for boosting H+ storage in aqueous zinc ion batteries. The unique integration of hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks and strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking endow it rapid Grotthuss proton conduction, stable supramolecular structure and inclined H+ storage.







Abstract
In the emerging aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs), proton (H+) with the smallest molar mass and fast (de)coordination kinetics is considered as the most ideal charge carrier compared with Zn2+ counterpart, however, searching for new hosting materials for H+ storage is still at its infancy. Herein, redox&#8208;active hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) assembled from diaminotriazine moiety decorated hexaazatrinnphthalene (HOF&#8208;HATN) are for the first time developed as the stable cathode hosting material for boosting H+ storage in AZIBs. The unique integration of hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks and strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking endow it rapid Grotthuss proton conduction, stable supramolecular structure and inclined H+ storage. As a consequence, HOF&#8208;HATN displays a high capacity (320&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and robust cyclability of (&gt;10000 cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) based on three&#8208;step cation coordination storage. These findings get insight into the proton transport and storage behavior in HOFs and provide the molecular engineering strategy for constructing well&#8208;defined cathode hosting materials for rechargeable aqueous batteries.

         <title>A reversible water&#8208;based electrostatic adhesive</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversible water&#8208;based electrostatic adhesive has been developed through conventional emulsion polymerization using commodity materials. It is made of two formulations, one containing a polycation, and other a polyanion. Detachment is only promoted in highly acidic or alkaline solutions as polyelectrolytes show distinctive charged states. This kind of adhesive would be useful for the recycling and dismantling of products.







Abstract
Commercial adhesives typically fall into two categories: structural or pressure sensitive. Structural glues rely on covalent bonds formed during curing and provide high tensile strength whilst pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives use physical bonding to provide weaker adhesion, but with considerable convenience for the user. Here, a new class of adhesive is presented that is also reversible, with a bond strength intermediate between those of pressure&#8208;sensitive and structural adhesives. Complementary water&#8208;based formulations incorporating oppositely charged polyelectrolytes form electrostatic bonds that may be reversed through immersion in a low or high pH aqueous environment. This electrostatic adhesive has the advantageous property that it exhibits good adhesion to low&#8208;energy surfaces such as polypropylene. Furthermore, it is produced by the emulsion copolymerization of commodity materials, styrene and butyl acrylate, which makes it inexpensive and opens the possibility of industrial production. Bio&#8208;based materials have been also integrated into the formulations to further increase sustainability. Moreover, unlike other water&#8208;based glues, adhesion does not significantly degrade in humid environments. Because such electrostatic adhesives do not require mechanical detachment, they are appropriate for the large&#8208;scale recycling of, e.g., bottle labels or food packaging. The adhesive is also suitable for dismantling components in areas as varied as automotive parts and electronics.

&lt;p&gt;A reversible water-based electrostatic adhesive has been developed through conventional emulsion polymerization using commodity materials. It is made of two formulations, one containing a polycation, and other a polyanion. Detachment is only promoted in highly acidic or alkaline solutions as polyelectrolytes show distinctive charged states. This kind of adhesive would be useful for the recycling and dismantling of products.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commercial adhesives typically fall into two categories: structural or pressure sensitive. Structural glues rely on covalent bonds formed during curing and provide high tensile strength whilst pressure-sensitive adhesives use physical bonding to provide weaker adhesion, but with considerable convenience for the user. Here, a new class of adhesive is presented that is also reversible, with a bond strength intermediate between those of pressure-sensitive and structural adhesives. Complementary water-based formulations incorporating oppositely charged polyelectrolytes form electrostatic bonds that may be reversed through immersion in a low or high pH aqueous environment. This electrostatic adhesive has the advantageous property that it exhibits good adhesion to low-energy surfaces such as polypropylene. Furthermore, it is produced by the emulsion copolymerization of commodity materials, styrene and butyl acrylate, which makes it inexpensive and opens the possibility of industrial production. Bio-based materials have been also integrated into the formulations to further increase sustainability. Moreover, unlike other water-based glues, adhesion does not significantly degrade in humid environments. Because such electrostatic adhesives do not require mechanical detachment, they are appropriate for the large-scale recycling of, e.g., bottle labels or food packaging. The adhesive is also suitable for dismantling components in areas as varied as automotive parts and electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A NIR Programmable In Vivo miRNA Magnifier for NIR&#8208;II Imaging of Early Stage Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 980/808&#8197;nm NIR programmed in vivo miRNA magnifier is developed by conjugating an activatable DNAzyme walker set to rare&#8208;earth nanoparticles, which detects tumors earlier than size&#8208;monitoring techniques. The 980&#8208;nm excitation&#8208;activated DNA nanomachine for miRNA&#8208;21 recognition and signal amplification to suppress &#8220;false positive&#8221; signals, and imaging in the NIR&#8208;II region under 808&#8197;nm excitation provided deeper penetration and lower background.







Abstract
Aberrant expressions of biomolecules occur much earlier than tumor visualized size and morphology change, but their common measurement strategies such as biopsy suffer from invasive sampling process. In vivo imaging of slight biomolecule expression difference is urgently needed for early cancer detection. Fluorescence of rare earth nanoparticles (RENPs) in second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) region makes them appropriate tool for in vivo imaging. However, the incapacity to couple with signal amplification strategies, especially programmable signal amplification strategies, limited their application in lowly expressed biomarkers imaging. Here we develop a 980/808&#8197;nm NIR programmed in vivo microRNAs (miRNAs) magnifier by conjugating activatable DNAzyme walker set to RENPs, which achieves more effective NIR&#8208;II imaging of early stage tumor than size monitoring imaging technique. Dye FD1080 (FD1080) modified substrate DNA quenches NIR&#8208;II downconversion emission of RENPs under 808&#8197;nm excitation. The miRNA recognition region in DNAzyme walker is sealed by a photo&#8208;cleavable strand to avoid &#8220;false positive&#8221; signal in systemic circulation. Upconversion emission of RENPs under 980&#8197;nm irradiation activates DNAzyme walker for miRNA recognition and amplifies NIR&#8208;II fluorescence recovery of RENPs via DNAzyme catalytic reaction to achieve in vivo miRNA imaging. This strategy demonstrates good application potential in the field of early cancer detection.

         <title>Biodegradable Dual&#8208;Network Cellulosic Composite Bioplastic Metafilm for Plastic Substitute</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel dual&#8208;network design strategy is proposed to prepare a high&#8208;performance cellulosic composite bioplastic metafilm with exceptional mechanical toughness (23.5&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3), flame retardance, and solvent resistance. Moreover, it has a high maximum usage temperature (245&#8201;&#176;C), lower thermal expansion coefficient (15.19&#8197;ppm&#8201;&#176;C&#8722;1), good biocompatibility, and natural biodegradation, which is competitive for plastic substitute.







Abstract
With the escalating environmental and health concerns over petroleum&#8208;based plastics, sustainable and biodegradable cellulosic materials are a promising alternative to plastics, yet remain unsatisfied properties such as fragility, inflammability and water sensitivity for practical usage. Herein, we present a novel dual&#8208;network design strategy to address these limitations and fabricate a high&#8208;performance cellulosic composite bioplastic metafilm with the exceptional mechanical toughness (23.5&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3), flame retardance, and solvent resistance by in situ growth of cyclotriphosphazene&#8208;bridged organosilica network within bacterial cellulose matrix. The phosphorus, nitrogen&#8208;containing organosilica network, verified by the experimental and theoretical results, plays a triple action on significantly enhancing tensile strength, toughness, flame retardance and water resistance of composite bioplastic metafilm. Furthermore, cellulosic bioplastic composite metafilm demonstrates a higher maximum usage temperature (245&#8201;&#176;C), lower thermal expansion coefficient (15.19&#8197;ppm&#8201;&#176;C&#8722;1), and better solvent resistance than traditional plastics, good biocompatibility and natural biodegradation. Moreover, the composite bioplastic metafilm have a good transparency of average 74&#8201;% and a high haze over 80&#8201;%, which can serve as an outstanding substrate substitute for commercial polyethylene terephthalate film to address the demand of flexible ITO films. This work paves a creative way to design and manufacture the competitive bioplastic composite to replace daily&#8208;used plastics.

         <title>Heterogeneous Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling for Sustainable Synthesis of Chiral Allenes: Application to the Synthesis of Allenic Natural Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient and stereospecific cross&#8208;coupling of propargylic mesylates and Grignard reagents for the synthesis of diverse chiral allenes catalyzed by a recyclable heterogeneous nanocopper catalyst is reported. The synthetic utility of this sustainable methodology was further demonstrated by its application to the asymmetric total synthesis of 5 valuable allenic natural products.







Abstract
Classical Crabb&#233; type SN2' substitutions of propargylic substrates has served as one of the standard methods for the synthesis of allenes. However, the stereospecific version of this transformation often requires either stoichiometric amounts of organocopper reagents or special functional groups on the substrates, and the chirality transfer efficiency is also capricious. Herein, we report a sustainable methodology for the synthesis of diverse 1,3&#8208;di and tri&#8208;substituted allenes by using a simple and cheap cellulose supported heterogeneous nanocopper catalyst (MCC&#8208;Amp&#8208;Cu(I/II)). This approach represents the first example of heterogeneous catalysis for the synthesis of chiral allenes. High yields and excellent enantiospecificity (up to 97&#8201;% yield, 99&#8201;% ee) were achieved for a wide range of di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted allenes bearing various functional groups. It is worth noting that the applied heterogeneous catalyst could be recycled at least 5&#8197;times without any reduced reactivity. To demonstrate the synthetic utility of the developed protocol, we have applied it to the total synthesis of several chiral allenic natural products.

         <title>Glycan Metabolic Fluorine Labeling for In Vivo Visualization of Tumor Cells and In Situ Assessment of Glycosylation Variations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a strategy called glycan MEtabolic Fluorine LAbeling (glycan MEFLA) for selectively tagging glycans of tumor cells. It allows for efficient and selective labeling of tumor cells by fluorinated monosaccharide&#8208;based probes (Ac4ManNTfe and Ac4GalNTfa), enabling in vivo visualization of tumor cells and in situ assessment of glycosylation changes via 19F MRI with high sensitivity and deep penetration.







Abstract
The abnormality in the glycosylation of surface proteins is critical for the growth and metastasis of tumors and their capacity for immunosuppression and drug resistance. This anomaly offers an entry point for real&#8208;time analysis on glycosylation fluctuations. In this study, we report a strategy, glycan metabolic fluorine labeling (MEFLA), for selectively tagging glycans of tumor cells. As a proof of concept, we synthesized two fluorinated unnatural monosaccharides with distinctive 19F chemical shifts (Ac4ManNTfe and Ac4GalNTfa). These two probes could undergo selective uptake by tumor cells and subsequent incorporation into surface glycans. This approach enables efficient and specific 19F labeling of tumor cells, which permits in vivo tracking of tumor cells and in situ assessment of glycosylation changes by 19F MRI. The efficiency and specificity of our probes for labeling tumor cells were verified in vitro with A549 cells. The feasibility of our method was further validated with in vivo experiments on A549 tumor&#8208;bearing mice. Moreover, the capacity of our approach for assessing glycosylation changes of tumor cells was illustrated both in vitro and in vivo. Our studies provide a promising means for visualizing tumor cells in vivo and assessing their glycosylation variations in situ through targeted multiplexed 19F MRI.

         <title>Rapid Charge Transfer Endowed by Interfacial Ni&#8208;O Bonding in S&#8208;scheme Heterojunction for Efficient Photocatalytic H2 and Imine Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel doping introduces spin&#8208;polarized electrons and weakens H&#8722;S bonds, resulting in enhanced H2 production. Moreover, the interfacial Ni&#8722;O bond significantly strengthens the built&#8208;in electric field (E) and reduces the energy barrier. Benefiting from doping and S&#8208;scheme heterojunction engineering, TiO2/Ni0.08&#8208;Zn0.2Cd0.8S quantum dots (QDs) show good charge transfer and separation, leading to improved H2 production and benzylamine oxidation.







Abstract
Cooperative coupling of H2 evolution with oxidative organic synthesis is promising in avoiding the use of sacrificial agents and producing hydrogen energy with value&#8208;added chemicals simultaneously. Nonetheless, the photocatalytic activity is obstructed by sluggish electron&#8208;hole separation and limited redox potentials. Herein, Ni&#8208;doped Zn0.2Cd0.8S quantum dots are chosen after screening by DFT simulation to couple with TiO2 microspheres, forming a step&#8208;scheme heterojunction. The Ni&#8208;doped configuration tunes the highly active S site for augmented H2 evolution, and the interfacial Ni&#8722;O bonds provide fast channels at the atomic level to lower the energy barrier for charge transfer. Also, DFT calculations reveal an enhanced built&#8208;in electric field in the heterojunction for superior charge migration and separation. Kinetic analysis by femtosecond transient absorption spectra demonstrates that expedited charge migration with electrons first transfer to Ni2+ and then to S sites. Therefore, the designed catalyst delivers drastically elevated H2 yield (4.55&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and N&#8208;benzylidenebenzylamine production rate (3.35&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). This work provides atomic&#8208;scale insights into the coordinated modulation of active sites and built&#8208;in electric fields in step&#8208;scheme heterojunction for ameliorative photocatalytic performance.

         <title>A Gene&#8208;Editable Palladium&#8208;Based Bioorthogonal Nanoplatform Facilitates Macrophage Phagocytosis for Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gene&#8208;editable palladium&#8208;based bioorthogonal nanoplatform was developed to improve tumor management, which can polarize macrophages to the anti&#8208;tumoral M1 phenotype, reprogram tumor cells to suppress anti&#8208;phagocytic signals, and induce the activation of sequestered prodrugs through bioorthogonal catalysis, thereby facilitating macrophage phagocytosis and allowing for more effective tumor treatment.







Abstract
Macrophage phagocytosis of tumor cells has emerged as an attractive strategy for tumor therapy. Nevertheless, immunosuppressive M2 macrophages in the tumor microenvironment and the high expression of anti&#8208;phagocytic signals from tumor cells impede therapeutic efficacy. To address these issues and improve the management of malignant tumors, in this study we developed a gene&#8208;editable palladium&#8208;based bioorthogonal nanoplatform, consisting of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system&#8208;linked Pd nanoclusters, and a hyaluronic acid surface layer (HBPdC). This HBPdC nanoplatform exhibited satisfactory tumor&#8208;targeting efficiency and triggered Fenton&#8208;like reactions in the tumor microenvironment to generate reactive oxygen species for chemodynamic therapy and macrophage M1 polarization, which directly eliminated tumor cells, and stimulated the antitumor response of macrophages. HBPdC could reprogram tumor cells through gene editing to reduce the expression of CD47 and adipocyte plasma membrane&#8208;associated protein, thereby promoting their recognition and phagocytosis by macrophages. Moreover, HBPdC induced the activation of sequestered prodrugs via bioorthogonal catalysis, enabling chemotherapy and thereby enhancing tumor cell death. Importantly, the Pd nanoclusters of HBPdC were sufficiently cleared through basic metabolic pathways, confirming their biocompatibility and biosafety. Therefore, by promoting macrophage phagocytosis, the HBPdC system developed herein represents a highly promising antitumor toolset for cancer therapy applications.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Ubiquitination of Tau Amyloids Promoted by the E3 Ligase CHIP</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The E3 ligase CHIP promotes ubiquitination of preformed Tau filaments in vitro and in living cellular models. The structural conformations of the fibrils restrict ubiquitination to specific regions of Tau. Tau seeding activity is not impaired by ubiquitination.







Abstract
Post&#8208;translational modifications of Tau are emerging as key players in determining the onset and progression of different tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease, and are recognized to mediate the structural diversity of the disease&#8208;specific Tau amyloids. Here we show that the E3 ligase CHIP catalyzes the site&#8208;specific ubiquitination of Tau filaments both in vitro and in cellular models, proving that also Tau amyloid aggregates are direct substrate of PTMs. Transmission electron microscopy and mass spectrometry analysis on ubiquitin&#8208;modified Tau amyloids revealed that the conformation of the filaments restricts CHIP&#8208;mediated ubiquitination to specific positions of the repeat domain, while only minor alterations in the structure of the fibril core were inferred using seeding experiments in vitro and in a cell&#8208;based tauopathy model. Overexpression of CHIP significantly increased the ubiquitination of exogenous PHF, proving that the ligase can interact and modify Tau aggregates also in a complex cellular environment.

         <title>Ligand Engineering Enables Efficient Pure Red Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The performance of eco&#8208;friendly PEA2SnI4 perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) lags far behind that of lead&#8208;based PeLEDs. We demonstrated a ligand engineering strategy that uses GSH as a surface ligand to strongly interact with I&#8722; and Sn2+ in perovskites, which thus reduces the film crystallization rate and suppresses the oxidation of Sn2+ ions. Pure red PeLEDs based on the modified PEA2SnI4 achieve a record EQEmax of 9.32&#8201;%.







Abstract
With increasing ecological and environmental concerns, tin (Sn)&#8208;based perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are competitive candidates for future displays because of their environmental friendliness, excellent photoelectric properties, and low&#8208;cost solution&#8208;processed fabrication. Nonetheless, their electroluminescence (EL) performance still lags behind that of lead (Pb)&#8208;based PeLEDs due to the fast crystallization rate of Sn&#8208;based perovskite films and undesired oxidation from Sn2+ to Sn4+, leading to poor film morphology and coverage, as well as high density defects. Here, we propose a ligand engineering strategy to construct high&#8208;quality phenethylammonium tin iodide (PEA2SnI4) perovskite films by using L&#8208;glutathione reduced (GSH) as surface ligands toward efficient pure red PEA2SnI4&#8208;based PeLEDs. We show that the hydrogen&#8208;bond and coordinate interactions between GSH and PEA2SnI4 effectively reduce the crystallization rate of the perovskites and suppress the oxidation of Sn2+ and formation of defects. The improved pure red perovskite films not only show excellent uniformity, density, and coverage but also exhibit enhanced optical properties and stability. Finally, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art pure red PeLEDs achieve a record external quantum efficiency of 9.32&#8201;% in the field of PEA2SnI4&#8208;based devices. This work demonstrates that ligand engineering represents a feasible route to enhance the EL performance of Sn&#8208;based PeLEDs.

         <title>Exploration of Chemical Diversity in Intercellular Quorum Sensing Signalling Systems in Prokaryotes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this manuscript, we investigate sets of both closely related and widely diverging quorum sensing (QS) ligand structures to identify orthogonal signalling systems. Our results suggest that structural diversity in QS ligands can be used as a starting point to predict non&#8208;cognate receptor&#8208;ligand binding in intercellular signalling systems.







Abstract
Quorum sensing (QS) serves as a vital means of intercellular signalling in a variety of prokaryotes, which enables single cells to act in multicellular configurations. The potential to control community&#8208;wide responses has also sparked numerous recent biotechnological innovations. However, our capacity to utilize intercellular communication is hindered due to a scarcity of complementary signalling systems and a restricted comprehension of interconnections between these systems caused by variations in their dynamic range. In this study, we utilize uniform manifold approximation and projection and extended&#8208;connectivity fingerprints to explore the available chemical space of QS signalling molecules. We investigate and experimentally characterize a set of closely related QS signalling ligands, consisting of N&#8208;acyl homoserine lactones and the aryl homoserine lactone p&#8208;coumaroyl, as well as a set of more widely diverging QS ligands, consisting of photopyrones, dialkylresorcinols, 3,5&#8208;dimethylpyrazin&#8208;2&#8208;ol and autoinducer&#8208;2, and define their performance. We report on a set of six signal&#8208; and promoter&#8208;orthogonal intercellular QS signalling systems, significantly expanding the toolkit for engineering community&#8208;wide behaviour. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ligand diversity can serve as a statistically significant tool to predict much more complicated ligand&#8208;receptor interactions. This approach highlights the potential of dimensionality reduction to explore chemical diversity in microbial dynamics.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quorum sensing (QS) serves as a vital means of intercellular signalling in a variety of prokaryotes, which enables single cells to act in multicellular configurations. The potential to control community-wide responses has also sparked numerous recent biotechnological innovations. However, our capacity to utilize intercellular communication is hindered due to a scarcity of complementary signalling systems and a restricted comprehension of interconnections between these systems caused by variations in their dynamic range. In this study, we utilize uniform manifold approximation and projection and extended-connectivity fingerprints to explore the available chemical space of QS signalling molecules. We investigate and experimentally characterize a set of closely related QS signalling ligands, consisting of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acyl homoserine lactones and the aryl homoserine lactone &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-coumaroyl, as well as a set of more widely diverging QS ligands, consisting of photopyrones, dialkylresorcinols, 3,5-dimethylpyrazin-2-ol and autoinducer-2, and define their performance. We report on a set of six signal- and promoter-orthogonal intercellular QS signalling systems, significantly expanding the toolkit for engineering community-wide behaviour. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ligand diversity can serve as a statistically significant tool to predict much more complicated ligand-receptor interactions. This approach highlights the potential of dimensionality reduction to explore chemical diversity in microbial dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Calculating temperature&#8208;dependent emission lifetimes is like a scavenger hunt. In their Research Article (e202308803), Leticia Gonz&#225;lez et&#8197;al. show that in [Ru(bpy)3]2+, the pathway governed by the lowest&#160;3MC&#8208;trans excited state triplet minimum leads astray. Instead, through the concept of rate&#8208;determining states and an extended kinetic model that takes all the different Jahn&#8211;Teller isomers into account, excellent agreement with the experiment is attained.

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure Fabrication of Binary Organic Solar Cells with High Molecular Weight D18 Yields Record 19.65&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by pressure cooker principles, we employ high&#8208;pressure methods to address challenges in processing high molecular weight polymers. Successfully dissolving HW&#8208;D18 in chloroform at 100&#8201;&#176;C within pressure vials, heightened vapor pressure elevates boiling point and solubility of chloroform. This enables the creation of blend films with superior properties, ultimately achieving an excellent PCE of 19.65&#8201;%, setting a new record for binary OSCs.







Abstract
In this work, inspired by the principles of a pressure cooker, we utilized a high&#8208;pressure method to address the processing challenges associated with high molecular weight polymers. Through this approach, we successfully dissolved high molecular weight D18 in chloroform at 100&#8201;&#176;C within a pressure&#8208;tight vial. The increased steam pressure raised the boiling point and dissolving capacity of chloroform, enabling the creation of a hybrid film with superior properties, including more ordered molecular arrangement, increased crystallinity, extended exciton diffusion length, and improved phase morphology. Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on D18&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO prepared using this high&#8208;pressure method achieved an outstanding power conversion efficiency of 19.65&#8201;%, setting a new record for binary devices to date. Furthermore, this high&#8208;pressure method was successfully applied to fabricate OSCs based on other common systems, leading to significant enhancements in device performance. In summary, this research introduces a universal method for processing high molecular weight D18 materials, ultimately resulting in the highest performance reported for binary organic solar cells.

         <title>Back Cover: Locking the Conformation of a Paddlewheel Rhodium Complex: Design, Synthesis, and Applications in Catalytic Nitrene Transfers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two structures of paddlewheel rhodium complexes displaying either syn or anti conformations are shown in the cover picture. Each of them stands on a separated podium, indicating that two conformations are not in an equilibrium and thus not undergo interconversion. The conformational fixation has proven to be useful for the development of selective nitrene transfer catalysts, as demonstrated by Xinxin Tang, Hidetoshi Noda, and Masakatsu Shibasaki in their Research Article (e202311027).

         <title>Neutral and Anionic Square Planar Palladium(0) Complexes Stabilized by a Silicon Z&#8208;Type Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first neutral and anionic square planar (sp) Pd(0) (ate) complexes are synthesized and fully characterized. Such species, which have been proposed as intermediates in Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross coupling reactions, are stabilized using a Si(IV) based Lewis acidic ambiphilic Z&#8208;type ligand, which causes a strong Pd&#8722;Si Z&#8208;type interaction as confirmed by DFT derived methods.







Abstract
Anionic [Pd(0)&#8722;X]&#8722; ate complex were proposed as key intermediates in Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling for decades, but their isolation remained elusive. Herein, a chelating Lewis acidic bis(amidophenolato)silane is introduced as a strong Z&#8208;type ligand which enables the characterization of the first anionic [Pd(0)&#8722;X]&#8722; ate complex. Intriguingly, these compounds and the neutral L&#8722;Pd(0) analogs exhibit a square planar coordination that is highly unusual for a d10 metal. Theoretical methods scrutinize the interaction between the Lewis acidic Si(IV) center and the late transition metal, while reactivity studies shed light on the potential role of anionic additives in oxidative addition reactions.

         <title>Combining Nitridoborates, Nitrides and Hydrides&#8212;Synthesis and Characterization of the Multianionic Sr6N[BN2]2H3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel strontium nitridoborate hydride Sr6N[BN2]2H3 was obtained by a solid&#8208;state synthesis, extending the family of multinary hydrides. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray and neutron powder diffraction data revealed the crystal structure containing nitridoborate, nitride and hydride anions. Impedance spectroscopy shows hydride ion conductivity and MAS NMR as well as vibrational spectroscopy corroborate the structural analysis of our compound.







Abstract
Multianionic metal hydrides, which exhibit a wide variety of physical properties and complex structures, have recently attracted growing interest. Here we present Sr6N[BN2]2H3, prepared in a solid&#8208;state ampoule reaction at 800&#8201;&#176;C, as the first combination of nitridoborate, nitride and hydride anions within a single compound. The crystal structure was solved from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray and neutron powder diffraction data in space group P21/c (no.&#8197;14), revealing a three&#8208;dimensional network of undulated layers of nitridoborate units, strontium atoms and hydride together with nitride anions. Magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR and vibrational spectroscopy in combination with quantum chemical calculations further confirm the structure model. Electrochemical measurements suggest the existence of hydride ion conductivity, allowing the hydrides to migrate along the layers.

&lt;p&gt;The novel strontium nitridoborate hydride Sr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;N[BN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; was obtained by a solid-state synthesis, extending the family of multinary hydrides. Single-crystal X-ray and neutron powder diffraction data revealed the crystal structure containing nitridoborate, nitride and hydride anions. Impedance spectroscopy shows hydride ion conductivity and MAS NMR as well as vibrational spectroscopy corroborate the structural analysis of our compound.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multianionic metal hydrides, which exhibit a wide variety of physical properties and complex structures, have recently attracted growing interest. Here we present Sr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;N[BN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, prepared in a solid-state ampoule reaction at 800&#8201;&#176;C, as the first combination of nitridoborate, nitride and hydride anions within a single compound. The crystal structure was solved from single-crystal X-ray and neutron powder diffraction data in space group &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; (no.&#8197;14), revealing a three-dimensional network of undulated layers of nitridoborate units, strontium atoms and hydride together with nitride anions. Magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR and vibrational spectroscopy in combination with quantum chemical calculations further confirm the structure model. Electrochemical measurements suggest the existence of hydride ion conductivity, allowing the hydrides to migrate along the layers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Self&#8208;Assembled Capsule for Propylene/Propane Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;soluble tetrahedral Fe4L6 metal&#8208;organic cage has been successfully used to separate propane and propylene under ambient conditions. Mixed gases of C3H6 and C3H8 were captured by Fe4L6 at the gas&#8208;liquid interface in a U&#8208;shaped glass tube. Governed by the guest binding affinity, C3H6 is released first after transport of the gases to the receiving arm of the tube.







Abstract
The development of energy&#8208;saving technology for the efficient separation of olefin and paraffin is highly important for the chemical industry. Herein, we report a self&#8208;assembled Fe4L6 capsule containing a hydrophobic cavity, which can be used to encapsulate and separate propylene/propane. The successful encapsulation of propylene and propane by the Fe4L6 cage in a water solution was documented by NMR spectroscopy. The binding constants K for the Fe4L6 cage toward propylene and propane were determined to be (5.0&#177;0.1)&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1 and (2.1&#177;0.7)&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1 in D2O at 25&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. Experiments and theoretical studies revealed that the cage exhibited multiple weak interactions with propylene and propane. The polymer&#8208;grade propylene (&gt;99.5&#8201;%) can be obtained from a mixture of propylene and propane by using the Fe4L6 cage as a separation material in a U&#8208;shaped glass tube. This work provides a new strategy for the separation of olefin/paraffin.

         <title>Rapid Polyolefin Hydrogenolysis by a Single&#8208;Site Organo&#8208;Tantalum Catalyst on a Super&#8208;Acidic Support: Structure and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cationic organo&#8208;tantalum catalyst AlS/TaNp3 (94&#8201;%) and AlS/TaNp2_AlNp (6&#8201;%) was synthesized via Np3Ta=CHtBu chemisorption on Br&#248;nsted acidic sulfated alumina (AlS). The proposed structures are in good agreement with SSNMR, DRIFTS, XANES, EXAFS, and DFT computation. Highly efficient AlS/Ta&#8208;mediated hydrogenolysis of diverse pre&#8208; and post&#8208;consumer polyolefin plastics to lighter alkanes is achieved.







Abstract
The novel electrophilic organo&#8208;tantalum catalyst AlS/TaNpx (1) (Np=neopentyl) is prepared by chemisorption of the alkylidene Np3Ta=CHtBu onto highly Br&#248;nsted acidic sulfated alumina (AlS). The proposed catalyst structure is supported by EXAFS, XANES, ICP, DRIFTS, elemental analysis, and SSNMR measurements and is in good agreement with DFT analysis. Catalyst 1 is highly effective for the hydrogenolysis of diverse linear and branched hydrocarbons, ranging from C2 to polyolefins. To the best of our knowledge, 1 exhibits one of the highest polyolefin hydrogenolysis activities (9,800 (CH2 units)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol(Ta)&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 200&#8201;&#176;C/17&#8197;atm H2) reported to date in the peer&#8208;reviewed literature. Unlike the AlS/ZrNp2 analog, the Ta catalyst is more thermally stable and offers multiple potential C&#8722;C bond activation pathways. For hydrogenolysis, AlS/TaNpx is effective for a wide variety of pre&#8208; and post&#8208;consumer polyolefin plastics and is not significantly deactivated by standard polyolefin additives at typical industrial concentrations.

Moving from homoleptic triple helical erbium complexes to heteroleptic adducts boosts the quantum yield of near&#8208;infrared to visible molecular&#8208;based light&#8208;upconversion by three orders of magnitude in solution at room temperature.







Abstract
Previously limited to highly symmetrical homoleptic triple&#8208;helical complexes [Er(Lk)3]3+, where Lk are polyaromatic tridentate ligands, single&#8208;center molecular&#8208;based upconversion using linear optics and exploiting the excited&#8208;state absorption mechanism (ESA) greatly benefits from the design of stable and low&#8208;symmetrical [LkEr(hfa)3] heteroleptic adducts (hfa&#8722;=hexafluoroacetylacetonate anion). Depending on (i) the extended &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, (ii) the flexibility and (iii) the heavy atom effect brought by the bound ligand Lk, the near&#8208;infrared (801&#8197;nm) to visible green (542&#8197;nm) upconversion quantum yield measured for [LkEr(hfa)3] in solution at room temperature can be boosted by up to three orders of magnitude.

         <title>A Subtle Change in the Flexible Achiral Spacer Does Matter in Supramolecular Chirality: Two&#8208;Fold Odd&#8208;Even Effect in Polymer Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Negligible changes of flexible spacers enable remarkable change of supramolecular chirality and anisotropic topology in azobenzene polymer assemblies. The phase transition from amorphous to LC phase can cause the chiroptical inversion in supramolecular assemblies, leading to two types of chiral arrangements with opposite helicity.







Abstract
Precise control over the chirality and morphologies of polymer assemblies, a remaining challenge for both chemists and materials scientists, is receiving ever&#8208;increasing attention in the recent years. Herein, we report the subtle manipulation of the achiral spacers from the chiral stereocenter to the azobenzene (Azo) unit, of which the chiroptical consistency or chiroptical inversion of self&#8208;assemblies could be successfully controlled and present &#8220;two&#8208;fold&#8221; odd&#8208;even effect. Furthermore, morphological transitions from 0D spherical micelles, 1D worms, and nanowires to 3D vesicles, spindle&#8208; and dumbbell&#8208;shaped vesicles were also unexpectedly found to exhibit odd&#8208;even correlations. These observations were collectively elucidated by mesomorphic properties, stacking modes, chiroptical dynamics, and stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviors. Negligible modifications to the spacer structures can enable remarkable modulation of supramolecular chirality and anisotropic topologies in polymer assemblies, which is of great significance for the design of complex chiral functional polymers.

         <title>Single&#8208;Scan Ultraselective NMR Experiments with Preserved Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;scan ultraselective experiments, based on the GEMSTONE (gradient&#8208;enhanced multiplet&#8208;selective targeted&#8208;observation NMR experiment) element, are a powerful approach to extract detailed information from complex NMR spectra. We describe an approach allowing to dramatically reduce signal losses due to translational diffusion, for applications to structure elucidation and mixture analysis.







Abstract
Selective NMR experiments provide rapid access to important structural information, and are essential to tackle the analysis of large molecules and complex mixtures. Single&#8208;scan ultraselective experiments are particularly useful, as they can rapidly select signals that overlap with other signals. Here, we describe a novel type of single&#8208;scan ultraselective NMR experiments that is robust against the effects of translational molecular diffusion, and thus make it possible to improve significantly the sensitivity of the experiment. This will largely broaden the applicability of this powerful class of experiments.

         <title>T Cell Antigen Recognition and Discrimination by Electrochemiluminescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a label&#8208;free approach for imaging immune synapses of T cells by electrochemiluminescence microscopy, which allows us to discriminate specific T cell receptor (TCR)/peptide&#8208;loaded major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) recognition, as well as the role of auxiliary molecules (costimulatory and adhesion molecules). The results would be useful in the development of tumour vaccines and adoptive T cell transfer immunotherapy.







Abstract
Adoptive T lymphocyte (T cell) transfer and tumour&#8208;specific peptide vaccines are innovative cancer therapies. An accurate assessment of the specific reactivity of T cell receptors (TCRs) to tumour antigens is required because of the high heterogeneity of tumour cells and the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment. In this study, we report a label&#8208;free electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging approach for recognising and discriminating between TCRs and tumour&#8208;specific antigens by imaging the immune synapses of T cells. Various T cell stimuli, including agonistic antibodies, auxiliary molecules, and tumour&#8208;specific antigens, were modified on the electrode's surface to allow for their interaction with T cells bearing different TCRs. The formation of immune synapses activated by specific stimuli produced a negative (shadow) ECL image, from which T cell antigen recognition and discrimination were evaluated by analysing the spreading area and the recognition intensity of T cells. This approach provides an easy way to assess TCR&#8208;antigen specificity and screen both of them for immunotherapies.

         <title>Designing Sulfate Crystals with Strong Optical Anisotropy through &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Tailoring</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The optical anisotropy of sulfate optical materials can be significantly enhanced by strategically tailoring the isotropic [SO4]2&#8722; tetrahedra with &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic modules.







Abstract
Sulfate crystals typically exhibit minimal optical anisotropy due to the near&#8208;zero polarizability anisotropy (&#948;) of [SO4]2&#8722; tetrahedra, arising from highly symmetrical electron clouds. Recent research sought to enhance &#948; via chemical modifications, such as fluorination. However, the resultant crystals often maintain subpar optical anisotropy, frequently with birefringence values below 0.1. In this study, we have uncovered that &#948; can be significantly strengthened by chemically tailoring the tetrahedral [SO4]2&#8722; with anisotropic &#960;&#8208;conjugated modules. This has been demonstrated by several newly proposed S&#8722;O&#8208;Org (Org: &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic species) moieties, which show a sharp increase in &#948; based on theoretical computations. To further validate this experimentally, we synthesized and characterized six new 3&#8208;pyridinesulfonate crystals with the formula A(3&#8208;C5H4NSO3)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xH2O (A=Li, Ag, K, Rb, Cs, and NH4; x=0 and 1). Notably, these materials exhibit strong optical anisotropy, with birefringence values ranging from 0.240 to 0.312 at 546&#8197;nm. These values are approximately 23 to 145.5 times greater than those of corresponding sulfates, and they outperform a vast number of sulfate&#8208;related optical materials, thus verifying the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Furthermore, the title compounds exhibit diverse microstructure peculiarities influenced by the size and binding natures of the counter cations.

         <title>Inside Cover: Reconfigurable Photonic Crystal Reversibly Exhibiting Single and Double Structural Colors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photonic crystals can display vivid structural colors via a selective reflection of visible light, and designing their spectra remains a challenge. In their Communication (e202311451), Koki Sano, Yasuhiro Ishida et&#8197;al. report a reconfigurable photonic crystal consisting of an aqueous dispersion of inorganic nanosheets that reversibly exhibits single&#8208;peak and double&#8208;peak structural colors when annealed under homogeneous and gradient temperature conditions, respectively.
