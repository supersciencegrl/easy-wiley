         <title>Asymmetric Electrosorption in a Bio&#8208;Inspired Reactor Enables Energy Efficient Ocean Carbon Removal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coral&#8208;inspired capacitive decarbonization (CDC) reactor enables direct ocean carbon removal by coupling selective electrodes with an asymmetric electrosorption strategy. Dissolved inorganic carbon is mineralized into stable CaCO3 with an ultralow intrinsic energy input (2.5&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 CO2) and demonstrated continuous operation over 100&#160;h without electrode fouling.








Abstract
Ocean carbon removal represents a promising pathway for mitigating residual anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2), yet existing methods are constrained by high energy demands and potential ecological risks. Here, inspired by the natural calcification process of corals, we present a bio&#8208;inspired capacitive decarbonization (CDC) reactor that sequesters dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) from seawater as CaCO3 using only seawater&#8208;derived Ca2+ and renewable electricity. The CDC system integrates a Ca2+&#8208;selective electrode with a weak electric field to regulate ion transport and disrupt the hydration shell of Ca2+, enhancing its reaction with CO32&#8722;. To address the limited concentration of CO32&#8722; relative to Ca2+ in seawater, we introduce an asymmetric electrosorption strategy to preferentially enrich CO32&#8722; at the electrode interface, achieving a DIC conversion rate of up to 34% with an ultralow intrinsic electrochemical energy input of 2.5&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 CO2 for the CDC reactor. The reactor exhibits stable continuous operation for over 100&#160;h without fouling, enabled by spatially decoupled CaCO3 precipitation. To mitigate the reduction in seawater alkalinity, we introduce a mineral&#8208;assisted re&#8208;alkalinization step that effectively restores pH and supports continued CO2 absorption. A global integrated analysis model shows the CDC technology could remove up to 11&#8211;438 million tonnes of CO2 by 2050&#8211;2100. This work demonstrates a scalable and low&#8208;energy solution for durable ocean carbon removal.

         <title>A Synergistic Cu/Ca Dual&#8208;Doping Strategy for High&#8208;Stability and Fast&#8208;Charging O3&#8208;Type Cathode in Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu2+/Ca2+ doped&#160;O3&#8208;type oxide Na0.98Ca0.01Ni0.35Cu0.05Fe0.2Mn0.4O2 (CuCa&#8211;NFM) was designed as a cathode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Cu2+ facilitates Na+ diffusion and suppresses Na+/vacancy ordering, whereas Ca2+ pillars restrain phase transition. The CuCa&#8208;NFM cathode displays a high&#8208;rate capacity of 86.02 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 C with 80.64% retention after 300 cycles.








Abstract
The O3&#8208;type layered oxide cathodes are highly promising for sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to their high specific capacity. However, the sluggish kinetics and poor interlayer stability caused by narrow layer spacing and volumetric stress accumulation limit their fast&#8208;charging and long&#8208;cycle performance. Herein, targeted interlayer regulation is conducted on O3&#8208;type layered oxide by introducing Cu2+ and Ca2+ into the transition metal (TM) and alkali metal (AM) layers, respectively. The introduction of Cu2+ effectively enlarges sodium&#8208;ion transport channels, mitigates oxygen arrangement around TM octahedra, and suppresses Na+/vacancy ordering, which is evidenced by scanning transmission electron microscopy and density functional theory calculations. Additionally, Ca2+ in the AM layer effectively mitigates volume variation during electrochemical reactions and preserves structural integrity, as confirmed by in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, resulting in lower lattice stress and mitigated phase evolution. The result is an exceptionally high&#8208;rate capability of 86.02&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10&#160;C (2.4&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1), accompanied by a prolonged lifetime with 80.64% retention after 300 cycles. This work demonstrates synergistic regulation of ion transport and lattice stability, providing new insights for cathode design.

         <title>Dynamic Kinetic Resolution Approach to Chiral Sulfur&#8208;Containing Aza&#8208;[5]helicenes via Chiral Lewis Base Catalyzed C&#9472;H Sulfenylation</title>

Abstract
A chiral sulfide&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H sulfenylation reaction for the efficient synthesis of chiral sulfur&#8208;containing aza&#8208;[5]helicenes has been developed for the first time. The chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diamine (BINAM)&#8208;derived sulfide, bearing a tert&#8208;butyl group, was identified as the optimal catalyst. The transformation proceeds via a dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) process, attributed to the low rotational energy barrier of the indole substrates. This approach features simple and mild reaction conditions, good functional group tolerance, and broad substrate scope (41 examples). A diverse range of chiral sulfur&#8208;containing aza&#8208;[5]helicenes were obtained in high to excellent yields with high to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% yield and 97% ee). Furthermore, this catalytic system demonstrates applicability for the modification of drug molecules and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) molecules. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that &#960;&#8943;&#960; and C&#9472;H&#8943;&#960; interactions play a critical role in determining the observed enantioselectivity.

         <title>Discriminative Peroxymonosulfate Activation on Iron Carbides for Redox&#8208;Neutral Singlet Oxygen Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report the covalent Fe&#9472;C bonds featured with moderate electron delocalization regulates peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation pathway and preserves the Fe valence state, affecting the contribution of radical pathway and electron&#8208;connection between PMS and phenol, thereby achieving high catalytic activity with exceptional stability. This study introduces a new paradigm for Fenton&#8208;like processes in wastewater treatment.








Abstract
In conventional redox cycle&#8208;based Fenton&#8208;like processes, the imbalanced rates between the reductive activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and the subsequent catalyst recovery by PMS oxidation often leads to the catalyst deactivation, posing a major challenge to achieving long&#8208;term stability. Herein, we report a discriminative, redox&#8208;neutral PMS activation pathway enabled by a core&#8211;shell Fe3C@C catalyst, which eliminates performance loss caused by such redox imbalance. Covalent Fe&#9472;C bonds within Fe3C@C suppress complete electron transfer for PMS oxidation or reduction, preventing the radical&#8208;forming pathways. Instead, PMS is activated through electronic induction, discriminatively cleaving the peroxyl O&#9472;O bond to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) as the sole reactive oxygen species (ROS) without significant changes in the Fe valence state, thereby greatly enhancing catalyst durability. Beyond PMS activation, the highly conductive Fe3C@C network serves as an efficient electron relay, promoting pollutant degradation with 1O2 by facilitating electron&#8208;exchange between PMS and pollutant. By integrating redox&#8208;neutral PMS activation with electron&#8208;connection driven pollutant oxidation, Fe3C@C achieves both high reactivity and exceptional long&#8208;term stability, overcoming the traditional trade&#8208;off between activity and durability. This work introduces a new paradigm in Fenton&#8208;like catalysis, demonstrating how covalent coordination engineering can unlock selective, nonradical pathways for sustainable and robust water treatment.

By integrating redox-neutral PMS activation with electron-connection driven pollutant oxidation, Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C@C achieves both high reactivity and exceptional long-term stability, overcoming the traditional trade-off between activity and durability. This work introduces a new paradigm in Fenton-like catalysis, demonstrating how covalent coordination engineering can unlock selective, nonradical pathways for sustainable and robust water treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Development and Application of Radical&#8208;Mediated Stereochemical Epimerization in Natural Product Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical&#8208;mediated stereochemical epimerization enables direct stereochemical editing at inert C&#9472;H sites and late&#8208;stage modifications of complex molecules. By controlling hydrogen atom transfer through abstraction and donation, and bond cleavage and reformation, researchers have achieved site&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective isomerization at challenging positions, including unactivated tertiary carbons and sterically hindered quaternary carbon stereocenters. This strategy facilitates the total synthesis of natural products.









Abstract
Precise control over stereochemistry (enantio&#8208; and diastereo&#8208;selectivity) is essential in the long&#8208;step synthetic protocol of complex molecules bearing multiple stereocenters, such as natural products and pharmaceuticals. Stereospecificity is the ideal goal for the formation of the first and subsequent chiral centers in the specific chemical environment through either an exo&#8208; or endo&#8208;genous molecule&#8211;molecule interaction. In this context, epimerization and isomerization offer valuable supplemental strategies for modifying preexisting stereocenters, thereby enhancing synthetic efficiency, enabling molecular diversification, and facilitating late&#8208;stage modification. Recent advances in radical&#8208;mediated epimerization have further enabled site&#8208;specific inversion of stereocenters, allowing late&#8208;stage access to diverse stereoisomers from a common intermediate. This minireview highlights emerging approaches in radical&#8208;based stereochemical epimerization and discusses their potential applications in the synthesis of complex molecules, emphasizing their role as a complementary strategy to previously established epimerization tactics. Also covered are recent developments in the epimerization of quaternary carbon stereocenters, an underexplored yet promising area that offers new opportunities for innovation in synthetic design.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted Prediction of Ground&#8208; and Excited&#8208;State Redox Potentials in Iridium(III) Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A data&#8208;driven framework integrating density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML) predicts ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state redox potentials of Ir(III) photocatalysts. Unified models enable interpretable structure&#8211;activity relationship (SAR) analysis and efficient virtual screening, supporting rational molecular design for advanced photoredox catalysis.








Abstract
This study introduces a data&#8208;driven framework that combines DFT calculations with machine learning to facilitate accurate and scalable predictions of ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state redox potentials for iridium(III) photocatalysts. We first constructed independent models to identify key geometric and electronic descriptors governing redox behavior. Shapley additive explanations&#8208;based analyses revealed clear structure&#8211;activity relationships, offering mechanistic insights and rational guidance for tuning redox potentials. Based on these insights, we developed unified multi&#8208;output models&#8212;Model G for ground&#8208;state and Model E for excited&#8208;state redox potentials&#8212;to enable rapid, cost&#8208;effective, and high&#8208;throughput predictions. By modeling oxidation and reduction processes within a shared descriptor space, we can reduce computational overhead while maintaining high predictive accuracy. To assess cross&#8208;metal generalizability, residual transfer learning was applied to osmium (Os) photocatalysts. Using feature&#8208;similar complexes, the resulting transfer models (G&#8208;T, E&#8208;T) achieved performance comparable to Os&#8208;only baselines, demonstrating efficient few&#8208;shot cross&#8208;metal transfer. Collectively, this study establishes an interpretable and transferable machine&#8208;learning framework for photocatalyst discovery. This framework provides a foundation for large&#8208;scale screening and rational design across diverse transition&#8208;metal platforms, accelerating advancements in photoredox catalysis, solar fuel production, and broader sustainable energy technologies.

         <title>Multicomponent Synthesis on a Diiron Platform of Stable Ferrabenzenes with Promising Anticancer Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot reaction on a diiron platform yields the first isolable series of ferrabenzene compounds. X&#8208;ray, NMR, and DFT studies confirm their aromatic character. Selected derivatives display favorable physicochemical prerequisites for biological applications and exhibit a promising in vitro cytotoxicity profile, linked to disruption of mitochondrial activity.








Abstract
Despite extensive research on metallabenzenes, ferrabenzenes have remained elusive, with only a single example reported to date, discovered accidentally. In this work, we present a reproducible, room&#8208;temperature reaction on a diiron bis&#8208;cyclopentadienyl platform, providing access to a class of four substituted ferrabenzenes (5a&#8208;c), stabilized by &#951;6&#8208;coordination to a second iron fragment. This synthesis involves a one&#8208;pot double C&#9472;C coupling of iminium, carbene (from a diazo compound), and carbon monoxide moieties, yielding ferra&#8208;cyclohexadienone derivatives (4a&#8208;c), followed by O&#8208;alkylation with alkyl triflates. Experimental and computational studies enabled the proposal of a plausible reaction mechanism. Combined X&#8208;ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and computational data support the aromatic character of the ferrabenzene ring in compounds 5a&#8208;c and, to a lesser extent, in their precursors 4a&#8208;c. Complexes 4a&#8208;c and 5a&#8208;c were further characterized by IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and IR spectroelectrochemistry. A selection of ferrabenzenes (5a, 5b, 5aEt) revealed physicochemical properties suitable for biological applications, including permanent air stability, adequate aqueous solubility and stability, and balanced hydrophilic/lipophilic profile. These compounds exhibited potent cytotoxicity in vitro against three cancer cell lines, with 5aEt standing out for its pronounced activity, attributed to disruption of cell redox homeostasis, and marked selectivity compared to two noncancerous cell lines.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Enabled by Dual Synergistic Interfacial Passivation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual synergistic interfacial passivation strategy using a tetrathiol&#8208;based molecule, pentaerythritol tetrakis(3&#8208;mercaptopropionate) (PETMP) to enhance the ZnO/perovskite interface for application in inverted perovskite quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (Pe&#8208;QLEDs). By incorporating PETMP, Pe&#8208;QLEDs achieved a record&#8208;high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 24.35%, accompanied by significantly enhanced device stability.








Abstract
Inverted perovskite quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (Pe&#8208;QLEDs) hold significant promise for next&#8208;generation displays due to their compatibility with n&#8208;type thin&#8208;film transistor&#8208;driven active&#8208;matrix panels, a critical advantage for industrial integration. However, interfacial reactions between the ZnO electron transport layer (ETL) and perovskite quantum dots (Pe&#8208;QDs) induce severe degradation and fluorescence quenching, undermining device efficiency and operational stability. To resolve this, we introduce a dual synergistic interfacial passivation strategy employing pentaerythritol tetrakis(3&#8208;mercaptopropionate) (PETMP) as a multifunctional buffer layer. The PETMP layer addresses interfacial incompatibility through two synergistic mechanisms: (I) Thiol groups in PETMP form robust S&#9472;Zn bonds with the ZnO ETL, passivating surface oxygen vacancies, improving film morphology, and reducing the electron injection barrier. (II) Concurrently, these thiols coordinate with undercoordinated Pb ions on the Pe&#8208;QD surface, enhancing luminescence efficiency and suppressing non&#8208;radiative recombination. This dual synergistic passivation strategy yields inverted green Pe&#8208;QLEDs with a record maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 24.35%, doubling the performance of conventional devices using polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) buffers (EQE&#160;=&#160;12.61%). Additionally, the optimized interface resulting from this strategy significantly enhances the operational stability of the devices. This work establishes PETMP&#8208;based passivation as a transformative approach for high&#8208;performance inverted Pe&#8208;QLEDs and other optoelectronic devices.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Al3+ competes with Fe3+ for transferrin (Tf) binding and enters cells via transferrin receptor (TfR)&#8208;mediated endocytosis, disrupting cellular iron homeostasis. Intracellular vesicle impact electrochemical cytometry (IVIEC) and single&#8208;cell amperometry (SCA), which record the oxidation of dopamine, reveal increased neurotransmitter storage and stabilized fusion pore dynamics, thus maintaining a release fraction comparable to control conditions.








Abstract
Widespread human exposure to aluminum (Al) has raised increasing concerns about its effects on neuronal functions since Al3+ can cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier and accumulate in neuronal cells, especially considering its ionic similarity to ferric iron (Fe3+), a metal strongly associated with neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we demonstrate that Al3+ affects vesicles in an iron&#8208;status&#8208;dependent manner in pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells, causing distinct changes under iron&#8208;normal, deficient, and overloaded conditions. Al3+ competes with Fe3+ for transferrin binding and enters cells via transferrin receptor (TfR)&#8208;mediated endocytosis, ultimately leading to cellular iron deficiency. This disruption alters dopamine&#8208;related proteins and molecular pathways, impairing exocytotic dynamics and reducing the average vesicular transmitter storage. When iron level is overloaded, TfR expression is downregulated to avoid Al3+ affecting vesicles. However, supplementation with ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) fails to reverse Al3+&#8208;induced iron deficiency due to Al3+ simultaneously upregulating TfR, allowing excess Fe3+ to further decrease neurotransmitter release. Furthermore, deferoxamine (DFOM), an Fe chelator, destabilizes exocytotic fusion pores, suggesting a potential drawback of chelation therapy. These findings highlight iron dysregulation as a key pathway through which Al3+ impairs vesicular function, providing a new insight into how metal ion interactions modulate neurotransmission.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Pyritide&#8208;Inspired Macrocycles Featuring Bipyridine Motifs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pyritide&#8208;inspired build/couple/pair strategy yields a diverse macrocycle library. This approach expands chemical space and enables the discovery of 6paW, a potent anti&#8208;ferroptotic agent.








Abstract
Macrocycles represent a promising class of drug&#8208;like scaffolds with unique structural features and the ability to engage challenging targets such as protein&#8211;protein interactions. Inspired by structural characteristics of pyritides, we constructed a library of 27 diverse macrocycles via a build/couple/pair approach, enabled by efficient synthesis of bipyridine&#8208;based triaryl building blocks through azaindole cleavage. Kinetic and cheminformatic analyses confirmed both reactivity trends and structural diversity. From this library, we identified a potential ferroptosis inhibitor, 6paW, with clear structure&#8211;activity relationships, validating our diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis platform. This strategy offers a robust approach to macrocycle library design, expanding opportunities for targeting previously inaccessible biological space.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Engineered Ultralong Phosphorescence in Double &#960;&#8208;Helical Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a novel class of double &#960;&#8208;helical nanographenes featuring a chiral cyclooctahexaphenylene core with diverse polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. This innovative design leverages symmetry&#8208;forbidden transitions governed by Clar's &#960;&#8208;sextet rule to achieve ultraslong phosphorescence. Thus, the D6h&#8208;symmetric hexabenzocoronene derivative 10 exhibits remarkable orange&#8208;red emission with&#160;5.5&#160;s lifetime and&#160;45&#160;s afterglow at 77&#160;K.








Abstract
The development of long&#8208;lived organic phosphorescent materials faces significant challenges in achieving precise control over triplet exciton emission processes. Herein, we present an innovative design strategy toward a novel class of double &#960;&#8208;helical nanographenes (8&#8211;10) by integrating a chiral cyclooctahexaphenylene (COTh) core with diverse polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The process underwent sequential Knoevenagel condensation, Diels&#8211;Alder [4&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition, and final Scholl dehydrocyclization, using phenanthraquinone dimer 3 as the key chiral building block. By systematically varying the symmetry of PAH subunits from C2 to C2v to D6h, we achieved remarkable orange&#8208;red phosphorescence with lifetimes (&#964;p) reaching&#160;5.5&#160;s and afterglow durations up to&#160;45&#160;s at 77&#160;K for 10 featuring highly D6h&#8208;symmetric hexabenzocoronene (HBC) moieties. This exceptional performance stems from three synergistic effects in high&#8208;symmetry, rigid PAHs: (1) significantly suppressed S1&#8594;S0 radiative rates (kf) due to symmetry&#8208;forbidden transitions governed by Clar's &#960;&#8208;sextet rule, (2) extremely low triplet radiative decay (kp), and (3) minimized nonradiative dissipation (knr). These double &#960;&#8208;helical nanographenes further demonstrate tunable chiroptical properties, with absorption dissymmetry factor (|gabs|) of 0.011 for 9 and exceptional Cotton effects (&#916;&#949; = 457 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1) for 10. This research offers a valuable insight into the molecular design of chiral afterglow materials.

         <title>Magnetic and Peroxidase&#8208;Specific Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme Through Cu&#8208;Doping Engineering for Ultrasensitive and Visual Tumor Diagnosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a magnetic and peroxidase&#8208;specific NiCu&#9472;Os nanozyme, through Cu&#8208;doping engineering, stable single&#8208;atom Os anchoring and superior POD&#8208;specificity can be obtained. NiCu&#9472;Os assisted strips can enrich and catalytic detection of ternary colorectal cancer biomarkers within 20 min, achieving perfect accuracy (AUC 100%) for CRC recognition. Attributing to the POD&#8208;specificity, NiCu&#9472;Os enables rapid (13 min) and visual distinction of CRC tumor tissues from non&#8208;tumor tissues via endogenous H2O2 levels within 13 min.








Abstract
Designing single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) with superparamagnetism and peroxidase (POD)&#8208;specific activity was still a challenge. In this research, we reported a novel magnetic SAzyme through Cu&#8208;doping engineering in a mild one&#8208;pot synthesis. Theoretical calculations revealed that Cu&#8208;doping can decrease the d&#8208;band center of NiCu substrate so that Os atoms adsorption and agglomeration can be suppressed, single&#8208;atom Os can absorb on the substrate, moreover, Cu&#8208;doping can bidirectionally modulate the energy barriers in the POD (decreasing) and oxidase (OXD) (increasing) catalytic process, which endows NiCu&#9472;Os with superior POD&#8208;activity but negligible OXD&#8208;activity. Attributing to the superparamagnetism and superior POD&#8208;activity, NiCu&#9472;Os SAzyme can separate targets in biological matrix and catalytic colorimetric detection without pretreatment. For practical application, NiCu&#9472;Os coupled strips were developed for point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC) diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC), three biomarkers (CA19&#8208;9, CEA, CST&#8208;4) can be separated from serum and visually detected on a single strip within 20&#160;min, achieving perfect accuracy (AUC 100%) for CRC patients&#8217; recognition. Furthermore, attributing to the POD&#8208;specificity, NiCu&#9472;Os enables rapid (13&#160;min) and visual distinction of CRC tumor tissues from non&#8208;tumor tissues via endogenous hydrogen peroxide levels. This work presents a novel paradigm for magnetic and POD&#8208;specific SAzymes, paving the way for integrated enrichment&#8211;amplification&#8211;detection platforms in POC diagnostics.

         <title>Alternating Magnetic Field Induced Ultra&#8208;Active Cu Sites in Trimetal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Low&#8208;Overpotential CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of nonmagnetic Zn and Mg atoms into the Cu&#8208;based ultrathin MOF induces spin&#8208;isolated Cu(II) active sites and enables local electronic energy elevation at the Cu sites under alternating magnetic field (AMF) stimulation. This design significantly enhances proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer dynamics, achieving efficient electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion at low electrode potentials. 








Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction is a sustainable approach to address climate challenges, requiring energy&#8208;economic catalysts that are highly active at low electrode potentials. Herein, we developed a Cu&#8208;ZnMg ultrathin metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), where Zn/Mg atoms enhance CO2 adsorption and CO desorption and the Cu sites show ultrahigh catalytic activity from CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO electroreduction under an alternating magnetic field (AMF). The Cu&#8208;ZnMg MOF@AMF exhibited a high current density (25.3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) at a low potential of &#8722;0.2&#160;V versus RHE with remarkable CO selectivity (&#8764;95%), surpassing that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Cu&#8208;based catalysts. The incorporation of nonmagnetic metals isolates the unpaired electrons at Cu(II) active sites which are antiferromagnetically coupled in the 1D Cu(II) chains. These spin magnetic moments can effectively interact with the AMF through spin&#8208;lattice relaxation, leading to local electronic energy elevation at the Cu sites. This AMF&#8208;induced activation of isolated Cu sites promotes cooperative proton&#8208;electron transfer, thereby enabling efficient from CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion at low electrode potential.

&lt;p&gt;The incorporation of nonmagnetic Zn and Mg atoms into the Cu-based ultrathin MOF induces spin-isolated Cu(II) active sites and enables local electronic energy elevation at the Cu sites under alternating magnetic field (AMF) stimulation. This design significantly enhances proton-coupled electron transfer dynamics, achieving efficient electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-CO conversion at low electrode potentials.

         <title>Symmetry Breaking and Hydrogen Bonding in Phthalimide Compounds Enable Efficient Room&#8208;Temperature Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence in Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Purely organic chiral room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emitters are gaining increasing attention, but predicting the key factors governing polarized luminescence remains challenging, as RTP is rarely observed in solution. The crucial role of hydrogen bonding and symmetry breaking in modulating chiral triplet excited&#8208;state interactions via n&#8208;&#960;* and &#960;&#8211;&#960;* state mixing is now highlighted, providing new molecular insights for enhancing circularly polarized RTP (glum up to 5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3).








Abstract
The development of purely organic chiral room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emitters is attracting more and more attention. However, the key parameters governing the polarized luminescence process remain difficult to predict and rationalize since the phosphorescence emission is rarely obtained in solution, hampering any structure&#8208;relationship studies. To address this challenge, we report here the synthesis and chiroptical properties of a new family of metal&#8208;free phosphorescent emitters based on phthalimide derivatives. Breaking symmetry of the phthalimide units and using intra&#8208; and intermolecular hydrogen bonding enable the obtention of circularly polarized (CP) RTP in solution with glum of up to 5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3. Interestingly, our investigations demonstrate the intricate role of hydrogen bonding interactions in modulating triplet state generation through the mixing of singlet and triplet states of different nature, i.e., n&#8208;&#960;* and &#960;&#8211;&#960;*, in the excited state, which is a crucial parameter for achieving intense CP&#8208;RTP. These results bring additional molecular design guidelines to reach CP&#8208;RTP in solution and additionally offer new insights into the subtle relationships between excited states of different spin multiplicity to reach higher CP phosphorescence intensity.

         <title>Spatial Confinement of Solution&#8208;Inaccessible Single&#8208;Site Cu(I) in a Molecular Titanium&#8211;Oxo Cage for Efficient Photo&#8208;Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular titanium&#8211;oxide cage, Ti16O24Bz24 (Bz = benzoate), featuring a &#8764;1 nm internal cavity and a hydrophobic Bz ligand shell, is developed to encapsulate a spatially confined Cu+ single&#8208;atom site, enabling the Ti16Cu2 catalyst to achieve high activity and selectivity for photoelectrocatalytic urea synthesis from CO2 and NO3&#8722;. 








Abstract
We introduce a precisely engineered molecular titanium&#8208;oxo cage, Ti16O24Bz24 (denoted as Ti16; Bz = C6H5CO2), designed to host a spatially confined Cu+ single&#8208;atom site, that enables efficient and selective C&#9472;N coupling from CO2 and NO3&#8722; under photo&#8208;electrocatalytic (PEC) conditions, providing a molecular&#8208;level blueprint for multi&#8208;reactant coupling catalysis. Ti16 features a large internal cavity assembled from TiO6 octahedra shielded by a hydrophobic benzoate shell. Metalation of Ti16 with CuCl2/NaBH4 incorporates Cu+ ions, displacing encapsulated H3O+ and enabling the synthesis of Ti16Cux (x = 0.25&#8211;8). Among the Ti16Cux series, Ti16Cu2 demonstrates optimal performance under PEC conditions, achieving a high urea yield of 20 mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a Faradaic efficiency of 85% and a selectivity of 62% at &#8722;0.6 V versus RHE, outperforming most reported Cu&#8208;based systems. Spectroscopic and structural analyses reveal that C&#9472;N bond formation occurs via coupling of *CO and *NO species at the confined Cu sites, highlighting the essential role of the molecular cage in stabilizing reactive species and facilitating their interaction. This work establishes cage&#8208;like metal&#8211;oxo clusters as an atomically precise and versatile molecular platform for developing highly selective single&#8208;atom catalysts for challenging multi&#8208;reactant coupling reactions.

         <title>Thermomagnetic Bistability, Colossal Negative Thermal Expansion, and THz&#8208;Heat&#8208;Induced Switching in Cu&#8208;Nitroxide Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bistability in molecule&#8208;based magnets is vital for device applications. We present the first Cu(II)&#8208;nitroxide complex with thermally driven bistability up to 144&#160;K and slow relaxation over 9 h at 95&#160;K via an unprecedented autocatalytic mechanism. Fast switching by a single THz pulse is demonstrated. Along with colossal anisotropic negative thermal expansion, these findings reveal new opportunities for advanced molecular devices.








Abstract
Bistability in molecule&#8208;based magnets is crucial for their applications in functional devices, and thermally induced excited spin state trapping (TIESST) represents a promising route to maintain two distinct spin states for a significant period of time. Heterospin compounds based on Cu(II) and nitroxide radicals demonstrate highly tunable non&#8208;classical spin transitions, nevertheless they did not reveal TIESST effects up to date. Here, we report the first Cu(II)&#8208;nitroxide complex that exhibits TIESST&#8208;driven bistability up to 116&#160;K. The TIESST temperature is close to temperatures of the spin transition, which is accompanied by a hysteresis of 30&#160;K (T1/2&#8593; = 144&#160;K, T1/2&#8595; = 114&#160;K). The trapped excited state features a very slow relaxation that exceeds 9&#160;h at 95&#160;K. Fast switching is also feasible for this complex: almost complete conversion from the ground to excited state occurs in a single THz pulse within 50&#160;ms. The slow relaxation and preservation of the crystal quality enabled us to perform an XRD study and demonstrate that the trapped and stable phases coexist during the transition. It was demonstrated, that relaxation of excited state proceeds via an autocatalytic mechanism, previously unreported for spin&#8208;crossover systems, which introduces a new paradigm in spin relaxation dynamics.

&lt;p&gt;Bistability in molecule-based magnets is crucial for their applications in functional devices, and thermally induced excited spin state trapping (TIESST) represents a promising route to maintain two distinct spin states for a significant period of time. Heterospin compounds based on Cu(II) and nitroxide radicals demonstrate highly tunable non-classical spin transitions, nevertheless they did not reveal TIESST effects up to date. Here, we report the first Cu(II)-nitroxide complex that exhibits TIESST-driven bistability up to 116&#160;K. The TIESST temperature is close to temperatures of the spin transition, which is accompanied by a hysteresis of 30&#160;K (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1/2&#8593;&lt;/sub&gt; = 144&#160;K, &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1/2&#8595;&lt;/sub&gt; = 114&#160;K). The trapped excited state features a very slow relaxation that exceeds 9&#160;h at 95&#160;K. Fast switching is also feasible for this complex: almost complete conversion from the ground to excited state occurs in a single THz pulse within 50&#160;ms. The slow relaxation and preservation of the crystal quality enabled us to perform an XRD study and demonstrate that the trapped and stable phases coexist during the transition. It was demonstrated, that relaxation of excited state proceeds via an autocatalytic mechanism, previously unreported for spin-crossover systems, which introduces a new paradigm in spin relaxation dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organocatalyzed Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (O&#8208;ATRP) Using a Super&#8208;Reducing Photoredox Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A super&#8208;reducing organic photocatalyst expands the scope of O&#8208;ATRP to challenging initiators and monomers. The system enables controlled polymerizations with air tolerance, temporal regulation, and grafting&#8208;from strategies, highlighting the transformative potential of super&#8208;reducing PCs in reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerization.








Abstract
The development of highly reducing photoredox catalysts (PCs) has brought forth new approaches to activating strong chemical bonds for small molecule and polymer synthesis. Organocatalyzed atom transfer radical polymerization (O&#8208;ATRP) is a polymerization methodology that uses organic PCs for the synthesis of well&#8208;defined polymers proceeding through a reversible&#8208;deactivation mechanism. However, the reaction scope of O&#8208;ATRP is confined to initiators and dormant polymer states that can be reduced by a PC. Herein, we report an O&#8208;ATRP system using a super&#8208;reducing PC to expand the capability of O&#8208;ATRP to monomers (such as styrene (St) and vinylcarbazole (VCz)) and initiators (including aromatic halides and pseudo&#8208;halides) that are challenging with most O&#8208;ATRP systems. This system provides control over polymerization, air tolerance, and temporal regulation and enables the synthesis of polymer brushes via organocatalyzed grafting&#8208;from reactions on linear chains. This strategy builds upon the transformative potential of super&#8208;reducing PCs toward advancing the field of reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerization.

         <title>Bioinformatics&#8208;Driven Design of Peptides for Membrane Stabilization During Cryopreservation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we developed class A &#945;&#8208;helix&#8208;based peptides through systematically analyzing the conserved 11&#8208;mer motifs of LEA proteins. The obtained ARE peptide exhibited optimal performance, being able to insert into phospholipids and increase membrane permeability to water during the freezing&#8208;thawing process. As a result, this class A &#945;&#8208;helix peptide succesfully alleviated the osmotic pressure, resulting in a 52% increase in post&#8208;thaw red blood cell recovery.








Abstract
During cryopreservation, cooling triggers membrane phase transitions from a liquid&#8208;crystalline to a gel phase, compromising membrane permeability, impairing water exchange, ultimately leading to cell death. Group 3 late embryogenesis abundant (G3LEA) proteins stabilize cell membranes under adverse circumstances through their functional&#160;11&#8208;mer repeats. Thus, we conducted a bioinformatics analysis of 11&#8208;mer repeats across LEA proteins and identified AKE, a class A &#945;&#8208;helix peptide that lowers the gel&#8208;to&#8208;liquid crystalline phase transition temperature (Tm). Structural optimization further established a key design principle: a class A &#945;&#8208;helix with a charge&#8208;segregated structure, featuring two positively charged faces separated by hydrophobic and negatively charged regions, designed to enhance membrane interactions by promoting electrostatic binding to phospholipid head groups while allowing hydrophobic regions to associate with lipid tails, potentially strengthening overall membrane affinity. Results confirmed that substituting lysine with arginine, which carries a more delocalized and stable positive charge, strengthened electrostatic interactions and reduced free energy. The optimized peptide, ARE, lowered&#160;Tm&#160;and reduced the extent of phase transition improved water permeability and osmotic resistance, leading to a 52% enhancement in post&#8208;thaw red blood cell recovery. By integrating structural design with charge modulation, this study provides a framework for developing membrane stabilizers through rational peptide engineering.

         <title>Boron&#8211;Oxygen Lewis Pairs Integrated Multi&#8208;Resonant Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter for High&#8208;Performance BT.2020 Deep&#8208;Blue OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of a B&#8211;O Lewis pair into an MR&#8208;TADF molecule's skeleton results in a stable, saddle&#8208;shaped 3BON molecule, which exhibits highly efficient deep&#8208;blue TADF emission at 440&#160;nm with a narrow FWHM of 18&#160;nm and a small &#916;EST of 0.12&#160;eV. The resulting OLEDs achieve a record EQEmax of 26.3% in the deep&#8208;blue region. 








Abstract
The quest for deep&#8208;blue emitters meeting the stringent BT.2020 color standard&#8212;requiring an ideal peak, narrow full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum (FWHM), and minimal singlet&#8208;triplet energy splitting (&#916;EST)&#8212;is often hampered by the complex synthesis of multi&#8208;resonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) molecules. This work introduces a novel, selective strategy: incorporating B&#8211;O Lewis pairs into an MR&#8208;TADF system via intramolecular electrophilic borylation. By carefully controlling a tandem bora&#8208;Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction, we synthesized the saddle&#8208;shaped molecule 3BON, despite the typical vulnerability of annulated boron structures to retro&#8208;bora&#8208;Friedel&#8211;Crafts reactions. 3BON exhibits highly efficient deep&#8208;blue TADF emission, with a peak at 440&#160;nm, a narrow FWHM of 18 nm, and a low &#916;EST of 0.12 eV. Compared to its parent emitter, DABNA&#8208;1, 3BON achieves a simultaneous blue&#8208;shift, narrowed FWHM, and reduced &#916;EST. Principal Interacting Orbital (PIO) analysis indicates that unique orbital interactions involving the B&#8211;O Lewis pairs destabilize energy levels, causing the blue&#8208;shifted emission. Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) utilizing 3BON demonstrated state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance. The device achieves a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 24.8% (at 9 wt.%) with ultra&#8208;deep blue narrowband emission (443 nm peak, 24 nm FWHM; CIE: 0.1554, 0.0454), fully satisfying the BT.2020 standard. Furthermore, 3BON's unique saddle&#8208;shaped architecture imparts remarkable doping tolerance, with EQEmax climbing up to 26.3% across a wide 0.520 wt.% doping range. A hyperfluorescent (HF) device also showed excellent performance (EQEmax = 23.8%, 441 nm peak, 19 nm FWHM). These results represent one of the best BT.2020&#8208;compliant OLED performances reported to date.

         <title>Organophotoredox and Cobalt&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Difunctionalization of Mono&#8208;Donor Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We disclose a novel catalytic paradigm for the 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of mono&#8208;donor cyclopropanes. A cooperative organophotoredox and cobalt catalytic system enables the selective ring&#8208;opening and homobenzylic oxygenation, facilitated through a two&#8208;fold acceptorless dehydrogenation sequence. This innovative method provides a straightforward synthetic pathway to structurally significant &#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8242;&#8208;oxyketone derivatives, demonstrating a board substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. 








Abstract
Selective functionalization of unactivated C&#9472;C and C&#9472;H bonds in mono&#8208;donor cyclopropanes represents a significant yet challenging goal in organic synthesis. Although numerous reported studies have documented the 1,3&#8208;difunctionalization of these substrates, effective strategies for 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization have so far proven elusive. Herein, we report a novel catalytic strategy enabling the 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of mono&#8208;donor cyclopropanes. By merging of organophotoredox and cobalt catalytic system, this method achieves selective ring&#8208;opening and homobenzylic oxygenation, facilitated by a two&#8208;fold sequence involving single electron transfer, nucleophilic addition, and acceptorless dehydrogenation. This unprecedented process overturns the predominant 1,3&#8208;selectivity in mono&#8208;donor cyclopropane functionalization, concurrently establishing a streamlined platform for forging &#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8242;&#8208;oxyketone derivatives in a sustainable manner.

         <title>Rotational Flexibility in Dication Drives Ambient Temperature Ferroelectricity in an Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Halide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study reports a new Ag(I)&#8208;based hybrid halide, (4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy)Ag2Br4, that shows ferroelectricity driven by the rotation of its organic cation. It undergoes a reversible ferroelectric&#8208;paraelectric phase transition at 330&#160;K, confirmed by experimental and theoretical analyses. This work emphasizes how organic cation dynamics can tune ferroelectric behavior in coinage metal&#8208;based organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid materials. 








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid halides (OIHHs) have gained attention as potential ferroelectric materials due to structure&#8208;property synergy of the organic and inorganic constituents. This study introduces an unusual Ag(I)&#8208;based ternary OIHH, (4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy)Ag2Br4, featuring rotational flexibility in the organic dication to induce asymmetry into the structure. The compound crystallizes in a monoclinic crystal system with a non&#8208;centrosymmetric polar P21 space group at room&#8208;temperature and undergoes a structural phase transition to a centrosymmetric phase (P21/c) at Curie temperature (Tc) of 330&#160;K which was further supported by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), second harmonic generation (SHG) signals, dielectric anomaly, current&#8208;voltage (I&#8211;V) profiles, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data. Ferroelectricity is confirmed through polarization&#8211;electric field (P&#8211;E) hysteresis loops and piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), exhibiting switchable polar domains. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed electronic structures of the ferroelectric and paraelectric phases, identified the (&#946;&#8208;AgBr2)nn&#8722; inorganic anionic chain contributing to the net polarization, and in general, complemented the experimental results. Comparative studies with structurally analogous Ag(I)&#8208;based OIHHs lacking dication rotational freedom endorse the critical role of organic flexibility in driving ferroelectricity. This study provides insights into the role of organic dications in controlling ferroelectric behavior and offers a promising pathway for developing coinage metal&#8208;based OIHH ferroelectric materials.

         <title>Unveiling the Role of Excited&#8208;State Dipole Moment: Governing Non&#8208;Sacrificial H2O2 Generation on Porphyrin Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The H2O2 generation rate of porphyrin&#8208;based photocatalysts correlates strongly with their excited&#8208;state dipole moment (&#181;e), rather than the traditionally emphasized ground&#8208;state dipole moment (&#181;g) or the number of carboxyl groups. Porphyrins exhibit prolonged exciton lifetime (&#8764;5&#160;ns), in contrast to the sub&#8208;nanoseconds typically in inorganic photocatalysts, thereby providing sufficient time for &#181;e&#160;formation.








Abstract
H2O2 production via the simultaneous oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and water oxidation reaction (WOR) on organic photocatalysts theoretically achieves 100% atom economy. However, the charge separation and transfer mechanism in such organic systems remains poorly understood, especially as organic molecular designs based on ground&#8208;state dipole moments (&#181;g) often fail to predict photocatalytic behavior. Here, we synthesize a series of carboxyl&#8208;modified tetraphenylporphyrin supramolecular photocatalysts (TPP&#8208;(COOH)n, where n&#160;=&#160;1&#8764;4, 8) to investigate the structure&#8208;activity relationship. The H2O2 generation activity follows the order TPP&#8208;(COOH)2&#160;&lt;&#160;TPP&#8208;(COOH) &lt; TPP&#8208;(COOH)3&#160;&lt;&#160;TPP&#8208;(COOH)8&#160;&lt;&#160;TPP&#8208;(COOH)4, increasing with the excited&#8208;state dipole moment (&#181;e) rather than the traditionally considered &#181;g or number of &#8208;COOH groups. The &#181;e, influenced by O 2p&#8208;band center shifts from carboxyl substitution, is demonstrated to govern the charge separation and transfer via an internal electric field. Moreover, exciton dissociation studies indicated that low&#8208;dielectric TPP&#8208;(COOH)n exhibits notably prolonged excitonic lifetimes (ca. 5&#160;ns), making &#181;e the key activity determinant. Based on this insight, we designed a high&#8208;&#181;e phthalocyanine supramolecular photocatalyst (H2Pc(COOH)8), achieving an unprecedented H2O2 production rate of 58 mM&#183;h&#8722;1&#183;g&#8722;1 and a quantum efficiency (QE) of 18.7% at 420&#160;nm. This study establishes &#181;e as a predictive parameter for H2O2 generation on organic photocatalysts.

         <title>Solvent&#8208; and Energy&#8208;Free Solid&#8208;State Strategy for Enzyme Encapsulation in ZIF</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208; and energy&#8208;free solid&#8208;state strategy is developed for synthesizing enzyme@ZIF biocomposites by directly mixing enzymes with ZIF precursors. Driven by acid&#8211;base interactions, the resulting biocomposites show enhanced activity due to multiphase crystalline structure, larger surface area, better electron transfer, and favorable enzyme conformation. They also exhibit excellent stability and reusability, offering a green route for robust industrial biocatalysts.








Abstract
Conventional enzymes immobilization strategies within metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF) typically require solvents and energy, resulting in solvent residues, environmental pollution, and high energy consumption. In this work, we present a solvent&#8208; and energy&#8208;free solid&#8208;state strategy for synthesizing enzyme&#8208;zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) biocomposites. The nucleation of enzyme&#8208;ZIF is driven by acid&#8211;base interactions through the directly mixing of enzymes with ZIF precursors. The resulting biocomposites exhibit up to a four&#8208;fold enhancement in enzymatic activity compared to liquid&#8208;phase methods and a 1000&#8208;fold increase compared to free enzymes. This enhancement is attributed to the ZIF's multiphase crystalline structure, larger pore size, significantly higher surface area, and greater total pore volume, as well as a more favorable enzyme conformation (e.g., an open active&#8208;site pocket) achieved during synthesis followed by immobilization. Additionally, the synthesized enzyme&#8208;ZIF composites display excellent stability against organic solvents, proteolytic enzymes, and high temperatures, along with outstanding recyclability. This simple and sustainable approach to biocatalytic ZIF synthesis paves the way for the development of green, efficient, and robust biocatalysts for industrial applications.

         <title>Unbiased Photoelectrochemical H2O2 Production Using Boron Nitride for Both Photogenerated Hole Extraction and Oxygen Reduction Selectivity Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The BVO/BN/FeNiOOH photoanode promotes water oxidation under light illumination, where BN acts as a hole extraction layer to promote charge separation. And the CoPc&#160;+&#160;BN cathode carries out continuous reduction of both anodically generated oxygen and atmospheric oxygen to H2O2, where BN as an electron acceptor to create electron&#8208;deficient sites for 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction.








Abstract
Unbiased photoelectrochemical (PEC) H2O2 production offers a sustainable alternative to the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process, yet faces critical bottlenecks: inefficient charge separation, uncontrolled two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) pathways, and high&#8208;purity O2 requirements. Herein, we report an efficient unbiased PEC system for H2O2 production under ambient air. The key innovation involves the strategic implementation of boron nitride (BN) serves a dual role as a charge transfer mediator and ORR pathway modulator. At the photoanode, BN functions as a hole&#8208;extraction layer, because of elevating the valence band position of BiVO4 (BVO), effectively suppressing interfacial charge recombination between the BVO photoanode and the FeNiOOH cocatalyst, resulting in a photocurrent density achieving 6.08&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23 VRHE. At the cathode, BN acts as a &#8220;reaction helmsman&#8221;, tuning the binding energy of the *OOH intermediate and enabling the CoPc&#160;+&#160;BN to achieve 97% 2e&#8722; ORR selectivity at &#8722;0.3 VAg/AgCl. As a result, the integrated system delivers a sustained H2O2 production rate of 1.22&#160;&#177;&#160;0.14&#160;mM cm&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 over 16 consecutive cycles. This study provides an innovative solution to address the key challenges in bias&#8208;free H2O2 production.

The key innovation involves the strategic implementation of boron nitride (BN) serves a dual role as a charge transfer mediator and ORR pathway modulator. At the photoanode, BN functions as a hole-extraction layer, because of elevating the valence band position of BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (BVO), effectively suppressing interfacial charge recombination between the BVO photoanode and the FeNiOOH cocatalyst, resulting in a photocurrent density achieving 6.08&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.23 V&lt;sub&gt;RHE&lt;/sub&gt;. At the cathode, BN acts as a &#8220;reaction helmsman&#8221;, tuning the binding energy of the *OOH intermediate and enabling the CoPc&#160;+&#160;BN to achieve 97% 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR selectivity at &#8722;0.3 V&lt;sub&gt;Ag/AgCl&lt;/sub&gt;. As a result, the integrated system delivers a sustained H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate of 1.22&#160;&#177;&#160;0.14&#160;mM cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; over 16 consecutive cycles. This study provides an innovative solution to address the key challenges in bias-free H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This review systematically compares structural and electronic properties of three iron porphyrin carbene isomers&#8212;terminal, bridged, and N&#8208;alkyl derivatives&#8212;across enzymatic and synthetic systems. X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals protein&#8208;induced adaptations and isomer&#8208;specific distortions, while M&#246;ssbauer and EPR spectroscopic studies elucidate ground&#8208;state electronic configurations and spin transitions.

Abstract
Iron porphyrin carbenes (IPCs), pivotal intermediates in enzymatic carbene transfer reactions, adopt diverse bonding modes and electronic configurations that govern their catalytic functions. This review systematically compares three IPC isomers&#8212;terminal carbenes, bridged carbenes, and N&#8208;alkyl derivatives&#8212;isolated from enzymatic systems with synthetic analogues. X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis, which reveals protein&#8208;induced structural adaptations and isomer&#8208;specific distortions, also facilitates M&#246;ssbauer and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic studies. Besides ground state assignments on the bridged carbene [Fe(TPP){C&#9552;C(p&#8208;ClPh)2}C1] ((dxy)2(dxz,dyz)2(dz2)1) and the N&#8208;alkyl Mb(N&#8208;CH2COBzyl)(His) ((dxy)2(dxz)1(dyz)1(dz2)1(dx2&#8722;y2)1), M&#246;ssbauer studies also reveal that alongside carbene fragment migration, the bridged carbene, which show shorter Fe&#9472;C(R) distance than the &#963; type Fe&#9472;C(sp2/sp3) bond, retains strong &#960; acceptor capability, in contrast to the stronger &#963; donor and &#960; acceptor capability of the terminal carbene and the N&#8208;alky derivative which nearly loses the bonding to iron. Accordingly, very large tetragonalities (|&#916;/&#955;|&#160;&gt;&#160;16) are observed for the bridged carbene Mb(CHCO2Et)(NMH) ((dxy)2(dxz,dyz)3) which exhibited rhombic EPR pattern under the near parallel ligand orientation. This work establishes critical connections between synthetic porphyrin and enzymatic systems, highlighting the adjustable scaffolds of engineered proteins in stabilizing various intermediates and advancing the mechanistic understanding of carbene transfer reactions.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Synthesis and Screening of a Cyanimide Library Identifies Selective Inhibitors of ISG15&#8208;Specific Protease mUSP18</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deubiquitinases (DUBs) and Ub&#8208;like proteases are attractive but challenging drug targets. We developed a high&#8208;throughput synthesis method and prepared a 7536&#8208;member cyanimide DUB&#8208;targeted compound library in 1536&#8208;well plates, using Echo acoustic dispensing. Screening yielded a selective, 35&#160;nM inhibitor of mUSP18, the main ISG15 protease. Treatment of interferon&#8208;stimulated EL4 cells with this inhibitor significantly enhanced ISGylation levels.








Abstract
High&#8208;throughput screening (HTS) of large compound collections is a critical early step in many drug discovery programs. Its success depends heavily on the quality of the compound libraries used, and as such, the development of targeted libraries has emerged to enhance the effectiveness of HTS efforts. However, the acquisition of such libraries remains costly and labor&#8208;intensive, often yielding compound quantities far exceeding required amounts. We present a high&#8208;throughput synthesis&#8208;to&#8208;screening method for the efficient in&#8208;plate generation and immediate HTS of a deubiquitinase (DUB)&#8208;focused compound library. Central to our approach is the Echo acoustic liquid handler, which transfers nanoliter volumes of DMSO&#8208;based solutions, facilitating miniaturized synthesis directly in 1536&#8208;well plates. We constructed a library of 7536 compounds featuring a DUB&#8208;privileged cyanimide warhead and screened against twelve ubiquitin(&#8208;like) proteases. This identified two structurally related molecules with selective inhibitory activity against the interferon&#8208;stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) protease mUSP18, which we further developed into a first&#8208;in&#8208;class mUSP18 inhibitor with 35&#160;nM potency. This compound, BB07CA902, demonstrated exceptional specificity for mUSP18 across 41 DUBs and effectively increased ISGylation levels in cells by inhibiting mUSP18 activity. Our technology enables the efficient preparation of large DUB&#8208;targeted cyanimide&#8208;based libraries, which will accelerate future DUB inhibitor development.

         <title>Superbasic Anionic Calcium Alkyl Complexes: Templated Twofold Deprotonation of Benzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of molecular anionic calcium alkyl complexes is described. Compared with their neutral analogues, these anionic systems show markedly higher basicity, exemplified by the templated twofold deprotonation of benzene to give an inverse&#8208;crown areneide complex. 








Abstract
Anionic calcium alkyl complexes have been synthesised through the reduction of ethylene by an anionic calcium hydride. The alkyl complexes are demonstrated to be superbasic, rapidly deprotonating ethers below room temperature, leading to C&#9472;O bond cleavage. In reactions with benzene, selective 1,4&#8208;metalation of benzene is observed, forming an inverse&#8208;crown areneide complex. This transformation, previously inaccessible to calcium, proceeds via a stepwise mechanism, which can also be facilitated by co&#8208;complexation with organometallic reagents such as tert&#8208;butyllithium and phenylpotassium.

         <title>Ligand Reorganization on Au Nanoclusters Boosts Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interactions between guanidinium cations and para&#8208;mercaptobenzoic acid ligands on Au nanoclusters trigger ligand reorganization and open new mass transport channels. These effects facilitate access of CO&#8208;reducing agent and CO2 molecules to the Au active sites, promoting further cluster growth and enhancing the electrocatalytic performance of CO2 reduction.








Abstract
Ligands are frequently employed to control nanocrystal nucleation and growth at the atomic scale; however, they often block active metal sites, limiting catalytic performance. In a recent pioneering study (doi.org/10.1002/anov.70001), Zhu et al. revealed that ligand reorganization can both control Au nanocluster growth and boost electrocatalytic CO2 reduction by creating additional mass transport channels to improve metal site accessibility.

         <title>Engineering Asymmetric Surfaces of Two&#8208;Dimensional Single&#8208;Layered Polyoxometalate&#8211;Layered Double Hydroxide Nanosheets via Interfacial&#8208;Assisted out&#8208;of&#8208;Plane Self&#8208;Assembly</title>

A novel type of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) asymmetric POM&#8211;LDH single&#8208;layered nanosheets, denoted as APLNs, was fabricated by an interfacial assembly approach. These APLNs not only visualized and quantified the charge distribution on 2D surfaces but also exhibited enhanced 2&#8208;electron selectivity in the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction.








Abstract
Constructing two&#8208;dimensional (2D) asymmetric single&#8208;layered nanosheets (2D ASNs) with anisotropic microstructures, intrinsic gradient electric field, and unprecedented energy conversion efficiency remains a great challenge. Here, we present an interfacial&#8208;assisted out&#8208;of&#8208;plane assembly method to synthesize a novel type of 2D ASNs composed of layered double hydroxide (LDH), polyoxometalate (POM), and dioctadecyldimethylammonium. The synthesized asymmetric POM&#8211;LDH single&#8208;layered nanosheets (APLNs) exhibited two distinct surfaces: one with hydrophilic Mg(Al)&#8211;OH groups and the other with hydrophobic alkyl chains. Molecular dynamics simulations elucidated that the strong out&#8208;of&#8208;plane electrostatic forces drive the assembly process and stabilize the asymmetric structures. By varying the size and charges of POMs, we observed a consistent 1: 2 charge ratio between each POM and its corresponding occupied LDH laminate area. This finding was further validated by visualizing the distribution of electron&#8208;rich POMs through transmission electron microscopy, inferring that the surface charge distributions on the 2D surfaces could be quantified and visualized. When applied to the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction, the hydrophobic surface of the APLNs demonstrated the H2O2 selectivity of &#8764;90% compared to that of &#8764;50% for the hydrophilic surface, highlighting the crucial role of the distinct surface properties in modulating the reaction pathway and product selectivity.

         <title>Superhydrophilic FeIV2MnII Nanocluster: A Combined Diagnostic and Therapeutic Agent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomically precise nanocluster with a superhydrophilic architecture acts as an efficient magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and photoacoustic imaging (PAI) dual&#8208;mode diagnostic agent, while providing for a photothermal&#8208;based antitumor effect.








Abstract
We report here an atomically precise nanocluster, (NH4)2MnII(H2O)2[FeIV(L)]2&#183;11H2O (Fe2Mn). This system was designed to harness superhydrophilic interactions to enhance magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), while permitting photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and photothermal antitumor therapy. It was synthesized using Fe&#8208;HDCL, an Fe(IV) system with strong near infrared (NIR) photothermal conversion capabilities, as a precursor and manganese(II) ion that allows for MRI as the metal center. Fe2Mn not only produces a useful photothermal effect but also provides for MRI enhancement with a longitudinal relaxivity (r1) of 7.67 mM&#8722;1s&#8722;1 at 0.5 T and 6.02 mM&#8722;1s&#8722;1 at 3.0 T, values that are nearly double those of common gadolinium&#8208;based contrast agents (e.g., Gd&#8208;DTPA, r1&#160;&#8776;&#160;3.0 &#8764; 4.0 mM&#8722;1s&#8722;1). This enhanced relaxivity arises from two para&#8208;positioned water coordination sites (q&#160;=&#160;2) on the manganese(II) ion and robust hydrogen bonding between hydrophilic groups on the Fe&#8208;HDCL surface and surrounding water molecules, forming a second&#8208;sphere hydration shell. As detailed below, the nanocluster of this study (Fe2Mn) enables high&#8208;quality dual&#8208;mode MR/PA imaging and effective low&#8208;dose (25&#160;&#181;mol&#183;kg&#8722;1) laser&#8208;triggered photothermal tumor ablation. The present study thus demonstrates how rationally designed superhydrophilic architectures that control both inner sphere coordination and second sphere hydration dynamics can give rise to more effective theranostic agents.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Planar Ge(IV)O4 Linkers in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Anodic Na+ Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two dimensional fully conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with novel planar redox active Ge(IV)O4 linkers have been fabricated, which show the thus far reported best anodic Na+ storage performance with high reversible specific capacities and excellent cycling stability.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for ion storage usually suffer from the employment of inactive linking units and intrinsically lower conductivity than 10&#8722;6&#160;S cm&#8722;1, resulting in significant specific capacity loss. Developing COFs with redox&#8208;active linkers in addition to the functional building blocks and highly intra&#8208;layer conjugated electronic structure for enhanced conductivity is therefore crucial toward enhancing ion storage capacity. Herein, two dimensional (2D) phthalocyanine&#8208;based (Pc&#8208;based) COFs, GeO4&#8208;MPc&#8208;COFs (M&#160;=&#160;Co, Ni, and Zn), with redox&#8208;active Ge(IV)O4 linkers and multiple active sites in the functional Pc building blocks were fabricated from octahydroxylphthalocyaninato metal complexes MPc(OH)8 and GeO2. The planar arrangement of Ge(IV)O4 moieties induces significantly p&#8211;&#960; interaction between Ge(IV)O4 moieties and Pc macrocycles, facilitating the delocalization of &#960; electrons throughout the 2D networks of GeO4&#8208;MPc&#8208;COFs and resulting in an impressive conductivity of 0.14&#8211;0.36&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2&#160;S cm&#8722;1. This, in combination with the reversible redox activity of Ge(IV)O4 linkers and N&#8208;rich Pc building blocks in the GeO4&#8208;MPc&#8208;COFs, leads to outstanding anodic Na+ storage performance with a high reversible specific capacity (607&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1) and excellent cycling stability (only 0.00057% capacity decay per cycle during 4,000 charge&#8211;discharge cycles at 5&#160;A g&#8722;1), representing the thus far reported best performance.

         <title>Spin Interactions in Supramolecular Assemblies of Porphyrin Oligomer Radical Anions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double&#8208;strand porphyrin ladder complexes offer an excellent way to hold two spin centers in a well&#8208;defined structure. Nutation experiments on the dianion of such complexes confirm the presence of doublet and triplet species. Spin dynamics simulations show that the emergence of these higher multiplicities can be fully accounted for by considering the dipolar interaction between electron spins.








Abstract
Diradicals have potential applications in spintronics, molecular electronics, and dynamic nuclear polarization due to their unique electronic structure. Supramolecular diradicals are particularly attractive, as changes in conformation can be used to switch the spin state. In this work, we explore a class of supramolecular diradicals formed by the self&#8208;assembly of charged zinc porphyrin oligomers with bidentate ligands such as 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) and 4,4'&#8208;bipyridyl. Field&#8208;dependent nutation experiments on the anions of porphyrin ladder complexes show nutation frequencies corresponding to doublet and triplet species, which can both be attributed to the same spin system using simulations based on the time evolution of the density matrix. Density functional theory was used to calculate dipolar coupling tensors and provided insights into the electronic structure of these double&#8208;stranded&#160;assemblies.

         <dc:description>
Molecular electronics is confronted with a fundamental challenge: balancing interfacial coupling strength. Strong coupling enhances mechanical stability but often reduces conductivity, whereas weak coupling favors high conductance yet compromises structural integrity. We solve this by integrating both strong and weak coupling modalities within a single&#8208;molecule architecture, achieving programmable ternary switching and memory with ON/OFF ratios &gt;102 and 950&#160;Hz frequency&#8212;setting a new performance benchmarkin molecular&#8208;scale electronic devices.








Abstract
Advances in molecular electronics focus on developing miniaturized electronic devices by leveraging molecules as fundamental building blocks. This approach exploits the unique structural properties of molecules and the robustness of their interfacial interactions with electrodes to achieve enhanced functionalities at the nanoscale. Achieving optimal balance between strong and weak interfacial couplings in molecular&#8208;scale devices to reconcile competing performance and stability requirements remains a significant scientific challenge. Here, we introduce a hybrid coupling strategy utilizing multichannel parallel circuits to integrate the stability of strong coupling with the high&#8208;energy molecular orbitals of weak coupling. Through precise mechanical modulation of interfacial coupling, we demonstrate programmable ternary switching and storage devices, achieving On/Off ratios exceeding 102 and switching frequencies up to 950&#160;Hz via tip manipulation experiments. This investigation illuminates the complex dynamics of interfacial coupling in molecular devices and proposes a promising approach to optimize device stability and functionality by harmonizing strong and weak coupling in multichannel parallel circuits.

         <title>Flux Synthesis of Lattice&#8208;Engineered Rutile Solid Solutions for Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;temperature flux strategy enables the formation of nitrogen&#8208;doped Ti&#8211;Ru rutile solid solutions for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The resulting catalyst exhibits high activity, remarkable Ru mass utilization, and long&#8208;term durability in both half&#8208;cell and proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) tests.








Abstract
Developing efficient and stable electrocatalysts for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is vital for advancing proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) technologies. Here, we report a flux synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;doped Ti&#8211;Ru rutile&#8208;type solid&#8208;solution oxides (M&#8208;TiRu4) using molten NaNO3 as the flux medium. The flux medium promotes the low&#8208;temperature conversion of TiN to rutile TiO2, while in situ&#8208;formed RuO2 nanoparticles facilitate lattice templating and couple with interfacial ion migration, enabling the formation of homogeneous solid solutions with abundant lattice heterogeneity. Simultaneously, nitrogen atoms are stably incorporated into the lattice of solid solutions, inducing bandgap narrowing, which enhances electronic conductivity. The developed M&#8208;TiRu4 catalyst exhibits exceptional acidic OER performance, delivering a low overpotential of 194&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, superior durability over 600 h, and a Ru mass activity 7.8 times that of commercial RuO2. At the device level, M&#8208;TiRu4 enables PEMWE operation at 1.64&#160;V @ 2&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 and maintains stable performance at 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for 200 h with a minimal degradation rate of 20&#160;&#181;V h&#8722;1. This work demonstrates a robust approach for designing high&#8208;performance, durable acidic OER catalysts via synergistic lattice and electronic structure engineering, paving the way for next&#8208;generation water&#8208;splitting technologies.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Arylated Allene Ketones Through Sequential Bismuth(V)&#8208;mediated Arylation and Organocatalytic Protonation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an asymmetric synthesis of &#945;&#8208;arylated allenones achieved via sequential bismuth(V)&#8208;mediated arylation and organocatalytic protonation. This method furnishes enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;arylated allenones with broad functional&#8208;group tolerance. Mechanistic studies support a cascade sequence involving enolate formation, arly migration, and irreversible enantioselective isomerization. This report represents the first example whereby organobismuth(V)&#8208;mediated arylation is coupled with asymmetric catalysis.








Abstract
Triarylbismuth(V)&#8208;mediated arylation represents an important approach for synthesizing a wide range of &#945;&#8208;arylated ketones and enol derivatives. Since the seminal work by Barton and colleagues in the 1980s, these C&#9472;C bond&#8208;forming transformations have been extensively explored. Despite significant progress, asymmetric variants of these reactions have yet to be developed. In this study, we document a sequential reaction consisting of bismuth&#8208;mediated &#945;&#8208;arylation of allene ketones and an enantioselective protonation of &#945;&#8208;arylated alkynyl ketones, leveraging the isomerization between allenyl and alkynyl intermediates. Our approach relies on a reversible/irreversible isomerization sequence comprising three distinct stages. The process initiates with the generation of enolates through reversible isomerization, followed by oxidative arylation and a subsequent enantioselective, irreversible isomerization to yield &#945;&#8208;arylated allenones. Both experimental results and theoretical studies support our mechanistic proposal. The sequential bismuth(V)&#8208;mediated arylation and enantioselective proton transfer is conceptually significant, as coupling bismuth chemistry with asymmetric catalysis may open new avenues for organobismuth(V) chemistry in enantioselective transformations and extend its utility in synthetic organic chemistry.

         <title>Identifying an Active Intermediate and Monitoring O&#9472;O Bond Formation in Water Oxidation by a Cobalt(III)&#8208;TAML Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two redox tautomers of a cobalt&#8211;TAML complex show strikingly different reactivity in water oxidation. The ligand&#8208;centered Co(III)&#8211;OH species evolves O2 via H2O2, while the metal&#8208;centered Co(IV) = O is inactive. Electron&#8208;transfer kinetics and the Marcus analysis reveal how redox localization influences reactivity and O&#9472;O bond formation in high&#8208;valent cobalt&#8211;oxo systems.








Abstract
A cobalt(III) &#8722;TAML complex, [(TAML)CoIII]&#8722; (TAML&#160;=&#160;tetraamido macrocyclic ligand), catalyzes water oxidation using one&#8208;electron oxidants like cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate (CAN) or tris(4&#8208;bromophenyl)ammonium hexachloroantimonate radical cation (TBPA&#8226;+). Two redox tautomers were characterized: a ligand&#8208;centered Co(III)&#8211;OH species, [(TAML&#8226;&#8314;)CoIII(OH)]&#8722; (1), and a metal&#8208;centered Co(IV)= O species, [(H&#8208;TAML)CoIV(O)(HOTf)]&#8722; (2), formed by oxidation with iodosylbenzene (PhIO) in the presence of triflic acid or with one&#8208;electron oxidants. 1 readily reacts with water to evolve O2 via H2O2, while 2 remains unreactive under identical conditions. Electron&#8208;transfer (ET) studies with electron donors such as diacetylferrocene (Ac2Fc) revealed that 1 is over 10&#8308; times more reactive than 2. The Marcus theory analysis showed a much lower reorganization energy (&#955;) for 1 (0.74&#160;eV) compared to 2 (2.7&#160;eV), explaining the dramatic rate difference. The detection of 1 during catalysis and kinetic isotope effect studies offers insight into O&#9472;O bond formation and underscores how redox&#8208;site localization controls water oxidation reactivity.

         <title>Dimensionality&#8208;Dependent Pressure&#8208;Induced Emission Memory in Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals a dimensionality&#8208;dependent pressure&#8208;induced emission memory in covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Only one&#8208;dimensional (1D) COFs retain a persistent fluorescence enhancement after pressure release, a phenomenon originating from anisotropic contraction and conformational locking of flexible linkages.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescent materials with memory effects hold significant promise for advanced applications in optical data storage and pressure sensing. We present the first crystalline covalent organic frameworks (COFs) exhibiting a pressure&#8208;induced emission memory effect, characterized by persistent pressure&#8208;induced emission enhancement (PIEE) that remains after decompression. Through the synthesis of a dimensional series of tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based COFs&#8212;JUC&#8208;730 and JUC&#8208;731 (one&#8208;dimensional, 1D), JUC&#8208;732 (two&#8208;dimensional, 2D), and JUC&#8208;733 (three&#8208;dimensional, 3D)&#8212;we systematically investigated how framework dimensionality governs photophysical responses under hydrostatic pressure.

     alt="Dimensionality-Dependent Pressure-Induced Emission Memory in Covalent Organic Frameworks"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study reveals a dimensionality-dependent pressure-induced emission memory in covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Only one-dimensional (1D) COFs retain a persistent fluorescence enhancement after pressure release, a phenomenon originating from anisotropic contraction and conformational locking of flexible linkages.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stimuli-responsive luminescent materials with memory effects hold significant promise for advanced applications in optical data storage and pressure sensing. We present the first crystalline covalent organic frameworks (COFs) exhibiting a pressure-induced emission memory effect, characterized by persistent pressure-induced emission enhancement (PIEE) that remains after decompression. Through the synthesis of a dimensional series of tetraphenylethylene-based COFs&#8212;JUC-730 and JUC-731 (one-dimensional, 1D), JUC-732 (two-dimensional, 2D), and JUC-733 (three-dimensional, 3D)&#8212;we systematically investigated how framework dimensionality governs photophysical responses under hydrostatic pressure. Remarkably, the 1D COFs exhibit pronounced PIEE, with JUC-730 retaining a 2.4-fold fluorescence enhancement post-decompression, representing the first observation of an emission memory effect in COFs.&#160;In situ&#160;FT-IR, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), and DFT analyses demonstrate that this memory effect originates from anisotropic unit-cell contraction, facilitated by conformational locking of flexible aryl&#8211;O&#8211;aryl (C&#8211;O&#8211;C) linkages in JUC-730, which results in a binding energy of &#8764;4.79&#160;eV that stabilizes the emissive state. By contrast, the 2D and 3D COFs either undergo fluorescence quenching or fail to retain emission enhancement due to irreversible structural changes.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Recognition of Inosine&#8208;Modified RNA by Deoxyribozyme with Distant Cleavage Site</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzyme, named RCD&#8208;I4T3,&#160;was identified through in vitro selection that specifically recognizes inosine&#8208;modified RNA and cleaves at a distant position, representing the first DNAzyme with spatially separated recognition and cleavage domains.








Abstract
We report an RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzyme (RCD), RCD&#8208;I4T3, discovered through in vitro selection, that can specifically recognize an inosine&#8208;modified site in RNA and cleave at a remote site (eight nucleotides downstream of the inosine). RCD&#8208;I4T3 represents the first DNAzyme with spatially separated domains for target recognition and catalytic cleavage, functionally analogous to Type IIS restriction endonucleases and endonuclease V, which is not previously observed in DNA catalysts. The RCD&#8208;I4T3 serves as a potent RNA&#8208;cleaving tool, exhibiting an observed rate constant (kobs) of 1.9&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 min&#8722;1 for inosine&#8208;modified RNA, and successfully targeting natural inosine&#8208;containing mRNA fragments with high specificity. This modular architecture minimizes the off&#8208;target activity through stringent two&#8208;step validation (i.e., recognition and cleavage) and enables independent functional optimization. The unique structural and mechanistic features of RCD&#8208;I4T3 expand the functional repertoire of DNAzymes for biological applications.

         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;throughput and universal wafer&#8208;scale patterning integration of perovskite single&#8208;crystal arrays with subwavelength nanostructures, tunable crystal sizes, different band gaps, and substrates is demonstrated by the synergy of the stencil&#8208;assisted printing technique and fluid dynamics modulation. Pure crystallographic orientation, accurate positioning, and high&#8208;quality perovskite single&#8208;crystal arrays empower low&#8208;threshold directional emission lasers and high&#8208;performance polarized photodetectors.








Abstract
Patterned perovskite arrays with subwavelength nanostructures have greatly accelerated the development of high&#8208;performance and multifunctional optoelectronic devices due to the strong light&#8208;matter interactions. However, the fabrication of perovskite subwavelength nanostructure devices suffers from polycrystalline structure, high cost, long cycle, and low throughput, which limits the application of large&#8208;area, high&#8208;performance, and multifunctional devices. In this study, we innovatively report a high&#8208;throughput and universal wafer&#8208;scale perovskite single&#8208;crystal arrays processing method by synergy of stencil&#8208;assisted printing technique and fluid dynamics modulation, enabling the patterning of perovskite single&#8208;crystal arrays with subwavelength nanostructures, tunable crystal sizes, different band gaps, and substrates. Pure crystallographic orientation, accurate positioning, and high&#8208;quality perovskite single&#8208;crystal arrays with subwavelength nanostructures ensure the realization of a low&#8208;threshold and directional emission laser. Furthermore, high&#8208;performance polarized photodetectors were demonstrated based on single&#8208;crystal arrays with subwavelength nanostructures. This pioneering work provides a new strategy and opportunity for the wafer&#8208;scale integration of perovskite single&#8208;crystal functional optoelectronic devices.

Inversely designing batteries for longevity: a hierarchical strategy that extends cycle life by separately and concurrently tuning design parameters and interfacial characteristics.








Abstract
Precise design and optimization of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) remain challenging due to their intricate, dynamic degradation mechanisms and the competitive interactions. Building upon a mechanism&#8208;driven LIB lifetime prediction model based on capacity degradation, we propose an inverse design and optimization procedure (IDOP) that integrates parameter sensitivity analysis (PSA) and multiobjective optimization (MOO). For modeling, we employ directly adjustable design parameters of the anode and electrolyte and indirectly derived interfacial characteristics of anode/electrolyte interface. The PSA results indicate that areal density, particle radius, and interface characteristics exert a significant influence on battery lifetime. Using data from a reference LiNi0.6Co0.1Mn0.3O2||graphite pouch cell for assessment, the MOO predicts a battery lifetime extension of up to 26.63% (70.97%) and 32.76% (138.41%) at 25 and 45 &#176;C by optimizing direct (indirect) factors, respectively. Evaluation of the MOO&#8208;optimized factors using the failure&#8208;mechanism&#8208;driven model demonstrates remarkable alignment in capacity degradation trajectories. The IDOP framework is a promising approach to improve the design and optimization efficiency for developing better LIBs.

         <title>Pre&#8208;Polymerization and Pre&#8208;Etching Dominated by Carbon Dots to Fabricate the Sub&#8208;Nanometer Microporous Carbon for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon dots (CDs) are used as the sole self&#8208;template to produce sub&#8208;nanometer microporous carbon with high packing density, large specific surface area (SSA), high yield, and high micropore area ratio, which challenges the conventional understanding of porous carbon synthesis and establishes CDs as a key member in the self&#8208;template family.








Abstract
The self&#8208;templating method is a facile and low&#8208;cost strategy to synthesize porous carbon materials, but the obtained products usually have low yields, limited specific surface areas (SSAs), and broad pore size distributions. It is a great challenge for the self&#8208;templating method to prepare the sub&#8208;nanometer (0.5&#8211;1.0&#160;nm) microporous carbon that is preferred for high&#8208;performance supercapacitors. In this study, carbon dots (CDs) are employed as the sole precursor to prepare porous carbon without using any activating agents. The obtained carbon materials have large SSA (2733.6 m2 g&#8722;1), high micropore area ratio (92.5%), high packing density (0.82&#160;g cm&#8722;3), high yield (12%), and concentrated sub&#8208;nanometer pore structure. The formation mechanism of such porous carbon and the unique functions of CDs as self&#8208;templates are interpreted by various characterizations. When used as electrodes for supercapacitors, this carbon material exhibits specific capacitance up to 639 F g&#8722;1 and is compatible with electrolytes of wide pH values and enlarged voltage windows (1.3&#8211;1.7&#160;V). The symmetric devices assembled by such material exhibit low self&#8208;discharge behaviors, excellent energy densities (15.9&#8211;44.1&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1), and good cycling performance even under the commercial&#8208;level mass loading (10&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) on electrodes.

         <title>Mannich Cyclization of Bifunctional Hydroxylamines by Aza&#8208;Kornblum&#8211;DeLaMare Rearrangement to Form Cyclopentyl &#946;&#8208;Amino Esters</title>

         <dc:description>
Bifunctional hydroxylamines act as novel N&#8208;alkyl imine surrogates, enabling an unprecedented phase&#8208;transfer&#8208;catalyzed (4&#160;+&#160;1) Mannich cyclization to construct cyclopentyl &#946;&#8208;amino esters bearing adjacent quaternary and tertiary carbon centers.








Abstract
We report that readily accessible N&#8208;haloalkyl hydroxylamines serve as bifunctional imine surrogates for novel (4&#160;+&#160;1) Mannich cyclizations with &#946;&#8208;keto esters under mild phase&#8208;transfer catalytic conditions. This method affords a series of cyclopentyl &#946;&#8208;amino esters bearing adjacent quaternary and tertiary carbon centers in good yields. Notably, the diastereomeric products are separable by silica gel chromatography under achiral tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) catalysis, enabling the streamlined synthesis of both pure trans&#8208; and cis&#8208;derivatives in a single operation. Furthermore, by employing a chiral phase&#8208;transfer catalyst, the reaction delivers the corresponding chiral products with high enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity (up to 92% ee, &gt;20:1 dr). Mechanistic studies reveal that the cyclization proceeds via a distinctive cascade involving C&#8208;alkylation, aza&#8208;Kornblum&#8211;DeLaMare rearrangement, and ring&#8208;closing Mannich reaction.

         <title>Quantifying &#197;&#8208;Scale Non&#8208;Additive Solvation at Nanoparticle Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS) with analytical fitting and Monte Carlo reconstruction reveals a molecular correlation between solvent microstructure and non&#8208;additive solvation at the gold nanoparticle (AuNP) surface. &#197;&#8208;scale solvent clusters emerge at azeotropic compositions, coinciding with a re&#8208;entrant ligand&#8208;shell transition from sphere to ellipsoid to sphere.








Abstract
Solvent organization at solid&#8211;liquid interfaces dictates nanoparticle stability, catalysis, and self&#8208;assembly. Classical physical&#8208;chemistry theories commonly treat solvent quality as an additive continuum variable&#8212;an assumption increasingly questioned at the nanoscale but rarely experimentally quantified. Here, we address this challenge by combining small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS) with Monte Carlo real&#8208;space reconstruction, allowing direct, molecular&#8208;level quantification of interfacial solvent structures under native solution conditions. In mixed solvents, we uncover discrete sub&#8208;nanometer solvent clusters whose abundance and spatial organization evolve non&#8208;linearly with solvent composition. These solvent clusters preferentially infiltrate nanoparticle ligand coronas, forcing ligand shells to deform from spherical symmetry into anisotropic ellipsoids&#8212;behavior that classical continuum core&#8211;shell models fail to describe. Interestingly, maximal solvent clustering, anisotropic deformation, and preferential solvent uptake coincide precisely at the bulk azeotropic composition, directly linking bulk solvent microstructure with nanoscale interfacial symmetry breaking. By turning a long&#8208;standing theoretical prediction into a quantitative measurement, this methodology establishes a versatile route for probing and ultimately tailoring solvation effects at a wide range of soft and hybrid interfaces.

Programmable chiral nanoarchitectonics are explored through sequence&#8208;specific dipeptide&#8208;NDI derivatives, revealing how assembly sequence and solvent control morphology and chiroptical properties. The eccentrical twists, as a unique chiral nanostructure, are constructed and exhibited amplifying chiroptical signal.

Abstract
Peptide self&#8208;assembly presents a powerful strategy for constructing chiral nanostructures with promising applications in biology and materials science. Here, we demonstrate the precise control over helical nanostructures through sequence&#8208;specific dipeptide&#8208;naphthalenediimide (NDI) conjugates. Two enantiomeric pairs of NDI derivatives, bearing either glycyl&#8208;L/D&#8208;leucine (Gly&#8208;Leu) or L/D&#8208;leucyl&#8208;glycine (Leu&#8208;Gly) sequences, were assembled in methanol/water and dimethylformamide/water mixed solvents. Strikingly, the Gly&#8208;Leu&#8208;functionalized derivatives (NDI&#8208;Gly&#8208;Leu) exhibited sequence&#8208;dependent chirality expression, forming eccentric twists and helices with significantly amplified chiroptical signals, while the NDI&#8208;Leu&#8208;Gly did not. We propose the &#8220;radius of torsion&#8221; to quantitatively describe the helicity of the nanostructures and correlate with their optical activity for the first time. We further revealed the generation of chiral NDI&#8226;&#8722; radical anions from NDI derivatives, which also showed the sequence&#8208;defined assembly effect. These insights deepen the fundamental understanding of peptide&#8208;directed chiral self&#8208;assembly and open new avenues for designing functional chiral nanomaterials.

Molecular&#8208;rotor&#8208;engineered MOFs with various interpenetrated degrees/modes enable precise modulation of porosity/stability. Among them, Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpb and Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpn exhibit improved C2H2 uptake, while Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpan shows rotor&#8208;driven stimuli&#8208;responsive gating effect at 195&#160;K. Breakthrough experiments confirm Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpb achieves one&#8208;step C2H4 purification from C2H2/CO2/C2H4 (1/9/90, v/v/v) mixture with new benchmark productivity.








Abstract
Efficient separation of challenging acetylene/ethylene (C2H2/C2H4) and acetylene/carbon dioxide (C2H2/CO2) mixtures is crucial for the chemical industry. Interpenetrated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) hold significant promise for separating complex gas mixtures but often face a trade&#8208;off between porosity and stability. Herein, three different entangled degrees and modes of MOFs, namely Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpb, Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpn, and Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpan, were yielded by the crystal engineering strategy using molecular&#8208;rotor&#8208;based co&#8208;ligands (benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene groups) to systematically modulate their porosity and stability. As expected, the stable Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpb/Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpn achieve enhanced porosity (27.2%/32.1%) and improved C2H2 uptake (73.9/75.8 cm3 g&#8722;1, 298&#160;K, 100&#160;kPa). Interestingly, Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpan exhibits the unique rotor&#8208;driven gating effect with free bpan ligands, facilitating the pressure&#8208;dependent switching between nonporous (10.8%) and open states at 195&#160;K. Breakthrough experiments confirm excellent C2H2 separation performance from binary/ternary mixtures and achieve one&#8208;step purification of C2H4 (&gt;99.9%) from C2H2/CO2/C2H4 (1/9/90, v/v/v) mixture with a new benchmark productivity of 396.9&#160;L kg&#8722;1 (Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpb). Theoretical calculations and in situ IR spectra reveal that C2H2/C2H4 and C2H2/CO2 separation are primarily governed by the abundant C&#9472;H&#8943;O/N and C&#9472;H&#8943;&#960; interactions. This study establishes a molecular&#8208;rotor&#8208;engineered approach to precisely modulate interpenetration in MOFs and offers a robust platform for high&#8208;performance gas purification.

         <title>Sandwich&#8208;Like Free&#8208;Standing Covalent Organic Framework Anion Exchange Membranes for Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We fabricate a sandwich&#8208;like structured freestanding covalent organic framework (COF)&#8208;based anion exchange membrane (COF&#8208;AEM) via in situ polyelectrolyte growth on COFs. The membrane overcomes polymer/COF incompatibility while utilizing COF nanopores for fast ion transport. Its rigid hydrophobic COF core suppresses swelling, complemented by a flexible hydrophilic polymer for robustness. This represents the first freestanding COF&#8208;AEM for water electrolysis. 








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer well&#8208;defined pores for efficient ion transport but suffer from poor mechanical stability. Herein, a sandwich&#8208;like free&#8208;standing COF&#8208;based anion exchange membrane (COF&#8208;AEM) is prepared, combining a COF core with in situ&#8208;grown functional polymer layers. This strategy not only overcomes the polymer/COF incompatibility but also retains the intrinsic nanopores of the COF framework, enabling ion transport with a conductivity of 110 mS cm&#8722;1 at 80 &#176;C under a remarkably low ion exchange capacity (IEC) (1.53&#160;mmol g&#8722;1). Furthermore, the rigid and hydrophobic COF core effectively mitigates the membrane swelling ratio (SR) (5.2% @ 80 &#176;C), while its combination with the flexible hydrophilic polymer skin enhances the robustness of the COF&#8208;AEM simultaneously, achieving a tensile strength of 21.4&#160;MPa. Demonstrated in alkaline water electrolysis, this represents the first free&#8208;standing COF&#8208;AEM for such applications. Our design expands COF&#8208;AEM structural diversity, offering a promising approach for advanced ion&#8208;conductive materials.

         <title>Nor[7]circulenyl Neutral Radical and Its Charged Species: Synthesis, Structures, and Efficient NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Conversion for Imaging and Laser Ignition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable nor[7]circulenyl radical (nor[7]CR) is synthesized and isolated in the crystalline form. nor[7]CR exhibits a distinct four&#8208;stage amphoteric redox behavior, and the charged species are isolated and characterized. The stable cation (nor[7]CR+) exhibits strong NIR&#8208;II absorption with a PCE of 93% and a high Tmax under low optical power density. The applications of nor[7]CR+ in photothermal imaging and laser ignition are demonstrated.








Abstract
[n]Circulenes have attracted considerable research interest; however, open&#8208;shell [n]circulene&#8208;type structures remain elusive. In this study, we report the synthesis of a highly stable nor[7]circulenyl radical (nor[7]CR) and its isolation in the crystalline phase. nor[7]CR exhibits a distinct four&#8208;stage amphoteric redox behavior, as revealed by cyclic voltammetry. The stable cation (nor[7]CR+) was obtained via chemical oxidation and isolated in crystalline form, and the corresponding anionic species were characterized spectroscopically. Remarkably, nor[7]CR+ exhibits strong NIR&#8208;II absorption at 1105&#160;nm with a high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of 93%, as well as a high maximum photothermal temperature (Tmax) under low optical power density. The applications of nor[7]CR+ in photothermal imaging and laser ignition were demonstrated, highlighting its great potential as a photothermal material.

         <title>Total Biocatalytic Synthesis of Capsaicinoids Using Ferulic Acid: A Versatile Two&#8208;Step Strategy for Natural Product Diversification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzymatic cascade was developed for the total synthesis of bioactive capsaicinoids from biomass&#8208;derived ferulic acid. The vanillylamine module (VM), containing phenolic acid decarboxylase (PAD), aromatic dioxygenase (ADO), and transaminase (TA), integrated with the capsaicinoid module (CM), comprising carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) and polyphosphate kinase (PPK) for ATP regeneration, enabling efficient amide bond formation to yield diverse capsaicinoids.








Abstract
The wide&#8208;ranging application of capsaicinoids, the active compounds in chili peppers, has driven increasing interest in the development of sustainable production strategies. However, capsaicinoid synthesis remains a challenge. The objective of this pioneering study is to report the total biocatalytic synthesis of structurally diverse capsaicinoids from bio&#8208;based ferulic acids. An X&#8208;ray crystallographic study elucidated the structural basis for the exceptional potential of a novel transaminase from Phaeobacter porticola (PPTA) to transform the highest ever reported concentration of vanillin (100&#8211;200&#160;mM) to vanillylamine, with &gt;99% conversion and modest conversion ranging from 48% to 79% for 300 to 500&#160;mM substrate. Using PPTA in tandem with phenolic acid decarboxylase (PAD) and aromatic dioxygenase (ADO) further enabled the direct synthesis of vanillylamine from ferulic acid with &gt;99% conversion. Furthermore, the integration of a multi&#8208;enzymatic cascade with carboxylic acid reductases (CARs) successfully synthesized structurally diverse capsaicinoids via amide bond formation between vanillylamine and free fatty acids, with excellent conversions ranging from 72% to &gt;88%. A 50&#8208;mM enzymatic reaction afforded 95% and 80% conversion of vanillylamine and capsaicin, respectively.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Modeling Midbrain and Brainstem Neuromelanins to Characterize Metal Binding and Associated MRI Contrast in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's Diseases (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 41/2025)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>

Neuromelanin is a pigment in the brain and an effective metal chelator. It is likely a crucial factor in the viability of neurons, which has sparked interest in MRI biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases. In their Research Article (e202509102), Harald E. M&#246;ller and co&#8208;workers demonstrate remarkable complexity of the binding of Fe and Cu to synthetic neuromelanin analogues, with different binding sites, competition, and intricate magnetic properties, all of which affect the proton relaxation of surrounding water, the main contrast mechanism in MRI.

In their Research Article (e202514014), Leticia Gonz&#225;lez, Georg Kresse and co&#8208;workers reveal the true antiferromagnetic ground state of such metal&#8208;organic frameworks by using spin&#8208;flip, broken&#8208;symmetry DFT. This intrinsic spin frustration determines structure stability and controls the temperature&#8208;dependent switch between N2 fixation and CO adsorption.

Incorporation of non&#8208;benzenoid rings into cycloarylenes profoundly affects their molecular geometry and photophysics. In their Research Article (e202512344), Zheng Zhou and co&#8208;workers report a reductive cleavage strategy that dissociates {FeCp} moieties to yield two anionic cycloarylenes, which exhibit abnormal anti&#8208;Kasha emission and ultra&#8208;long thermally activated delayed fluorescence.

A method to extend lanthanide emission lifetimes by utilizing dynamic molecular triplet excitons in lanthanide complex aggregates is presented by Yuichi Kitagawa, Takuma Nakai, and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202513236). The image illustrates that the triplet exciton migration among phenanthrene ligands extends Eu3+ emission lifetime. This emission lifetime tuning method enhances the encoding capacity of luminescent lanthanide complexes.

         <title>Considerations in Pursuing Reaction Scope Generality</title>

         <dc:description>
Synthetic methods that are applicable to a broad range of substrates are sought after, owing to their utility in industrial settings. This minireview describes considerations associated with how chemists define and identify general methods, especially with the emergence of modern analytical, high&#8208;throughput, and data science tools in chemistry, and gives the reader an overview of workflows that have been used to expedite this pursuit.








Abstract
The term &#8220;generality&#8221; has recently been popularized in synthetic chemistry, owing largely to the increasing use of high&#8208;throughput technology for producing vast quantities of data and the emergence of data science tools to plan and interpret these experiments. Despite this, the term has not been clearly defined, and there is no standardized approach toward developing a method with a diverse (general) scope. This minireview will examine different emerging strategies toward achieving generality using selected examples and aims to give the reader an overview of modern workflows that have been used to expedite this pursuit.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term &#8220;generality&#8221; has recently been popularized in synthetic chemistry, owing largely to the increasing use of high-throughput technology for producing vast quantities of data and the emergence of data science tools to plan and interpret these experiments. Despite this, the term has not been clearly defined, and there is no standardized approach toward developing a method with a diverse (general) scope. This minireview will examine different emerging strategies toward achieving generality using selected examples and aims to give the reader an overview of modern workflows that have been used to expedite this pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Topology&#8208;Engineered Guide RNAs for Programmable Control of CRISPR/Cas Activity</title>

Topology&#8208;engineered guide RNAs (TE&#8208;gRNAs) provide precise spatiotemporal control over CRISPR/Cas9, Cas12a, and Cas13 systems. By introducing photolabile and chemical&#8208;responsive modifications into RNA topology, such as polymeric, cyclic or star&#8208;shaped architectures, this Minireview presents strategies to reversibly modulate gene editing activities, enabling programmable and conditional genome engineering.








Abstract
CRISPR/Cas systems have transformed genome editing, yet achieving precise temporal and conditional control remains challenging. Traditional strategies involving linear guide RNAs (gRNAs) modified with multiple chemical groups throughout their strands often face limitations such as heterogeneous reaction outcomes, irreversibility, and variable editing efficiencies. To overcome these issues, topology&#8208;engineered guide RNAs (TE&#8208;gRNAs) have emerged, featuring defined structural architectures including polymeric, circular, and dendrimer&#8208;like topologies that enable precise spatial control, reversibility, and programmable activation of CRISPR activity. By selectively incorporating physical or chemically responsive linkers and stimuli&#8208;sensitive groups at specific sites, TE&#8208;gRNAs facilitate dynamic and conditional genome editing that can be activated or deactivated with external triggers such as light or chemical signals. These engineered RNA structures significantly improve synthesis feasibility, stability, reduce off&#8208;target effects, and provide unprecedented control over gene editing processes. Recent advancements in TE&#8208;gRNAs demonstrate their broad applicability in synthetic biology, functional genomics, and therapeutic interventions, highlighting their potential to achieve precise spatiotemporal modulation of CRISPR systems. This review summarizes the current strategies, benefits, and challenges associated with TE&#8208;gRNAs, and discusses future directions for enhancing their performance and utility in complex genome editing applications.

         <title>Modeling Midbrain and Brainstem Neuromelanins to Characterize Metal Binding and Associated MRI Contrast in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's Diseases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic neuromelanin analogs are used to characterize iron and copper binding to the melanin moiety or to conjugated protein (&#946;&#8208;lactoglobulin). The models confirm the presence of paramagnetic mononuclear&#8208;binding sites and iron or mixed&#8208;metal clusters that enhance water proton relaxation to varying degrees. The results help to better understand MRI contrast changes related to altered neuromelanin content in the brain due to neurodegeneration.








Abstract
Neuromelanin (NM) is a dark pigment that binds potentially toxic metal ions and is crucial for neuronal vulnerability. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was proposed to measure neuromelanin in the substantia nigra or locus coeruleus, potentially providing a marker of Parkinson's disease. Here, synthetic neuromelanin analogues were prepared with iron and copper and used for characterization of metal binding and impact on proton relaxation, a prerequisite for optimizing neuromelanin&#8208;sensitive MRI. The results confirm the presence of paramagnetic mononuclear Fe(III) and antiferromagnetically coupled clusters, which enhance relaxation to variable degrees. Further complexity arises from Cu(II), which can compete for binding to mononuclear sites, aggregate in mixed&#8208;metal clusters, or bind to proteins associated with the melanin moiety. Unlike the strong relaxant Fe(III), Cu(II) only indirectly impacts relaxation by replacing iron. Overall, MRI primarily provides measures of average neuromelanin concentrations. Information on the distribution of neuromelanins with different metal compositions might be obtained with multiparametric MRI.

         <title>Time&#8208;Resolved Spectroelectrochemical Observation of Overlayer&#8208;Induced Charge Carrier Dynamics in Water Photooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>

TiO2 overlayers on WO3 photoanode enhance photoelectrochemical water oxidation by surface and interfacial engineering. Operando transient absorption spectroscopy reveals photogenerated electron trapping pathway in ionized states driven by band bending. These findings demonstrate how surface properties, PEC performance, and charge carrier kinetics interrelate, highlighting the significance of band bending modifications.








Abstract
Surface and interface engineering is essential for constructing efficient and stable photoelectrodes for photoelectrochemical (PEC) solar fuel production. Despite the recent advances in photoelectrode optimization for the practical application, the corresponding interfacial reaction mechanism has not been elucidated owing to a lack of suitable measurements at the semiconductor&#8211;electrolyte interface (SEI). Herein, the key factor for an interfacial reaction in a model system (WO3 photoanode coated with amorphous TiO2 overlayers) is elucidated using operando spectroelectrochemistry. The thin TiO2 overlayers are shown to enhance n&#8208;type semiconductor characteristics and heal the excessive oxygen vacancies on the WO3 photoanode surface, which suggests reduced bulk and surface charge carrier recombination and 1.5&#8208;fold increase in Faradaic efficiency. Operando transient absorption spectroscopy measurements reveal that the overlayers accelerate the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the electrode to the external circuit and increase the population of trapped holes by promoting band bending, which reveals that the kinetic connection between ultrafast phenomena and real water oxidation reaction.

&lt;p&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; overlayers on WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; photoanode enhance photoelectrochemical water oxidation by surface and interfacial engineering. Operando transient absorption spectroscopy reveals photogenerated electron trapping pathway in ionized states driven by band bending. These findings demonstrate how surface properties, PEC performance, and charge carrier kinetics interrelate, highlighting the significance of band bending modifications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surface and interface engineering is essential for constructing efficient and stable photoelectrodes for photoelectrochemical (PEC) solar fuel production. Despite the recent advances in photoelectrode optimization for the practical application, the corresponding interfacial reaction mechanism has not been elucidated owing to a lack of suitable measurements at the semiconductor&#8211;electrolyte interface (SEI). Herein, the key factor for an interfacial reaction in a model system (WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; photoanode coated with amorphous TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; overlayers) is elucidated using operando spectroelectrochemistry. The thin TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; overlayers are shown to enhance n-type semiconductor characteristics and heal the excessive oxygen vacancies on the WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; photoanode surface, which suggests reduced bulk and surface charge carrier recombination and 1.5-fold increase in Faradaic efficiency. Operando transient absorption spectroscopy measurements reveal that the overlayers accelerate the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the electrode to the external circuit and increase the population of trapped holes by promoting band bending, which reveals that the kinetic connection between ultrafast phenomena and real water oxidation reaction. Thus, our work elucidates band bending in the space-charge region as a key factor and provides a major strategy for designing surface-modified PEC devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Sulfur(VI)&#8208;fluoride exchange (SuFEx) moiety can be installed on amino acid N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides so that SuFEx click chemistry can be enabled on the corresponding polypeptides. By allowing the use of simple hydroxyl and amino groups on functional moieties of interest with minimal preset conditions, and utilizing the functionalities of SuFEx linkages, high throughput preparation of diverse functional polypeptides can be made possible.








Abstract
Facile but effective synthesis and functionalization of polypeptides has long been a challenge, blocking the way to further explorations of their properties and potential applications. Here, we report the incorporation of sulfur(VI)&#8208;fluoride exchange (SuFEx) moiety in amino acid N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides, which grant the resulting polypeptides from ring&#8208;opening polymerization the ability to utilize simple hydroxyl and amino groups on functional moieties of interest without the requirement for the introduction of preset conditions, such as reactive molecular anchors. We prepared series of polypeptides modified with sulfates or amidosulfonates (sulfamates), and importantly, we demonstrate that such linkages derived from SuFEx exhibit unique nature, which possibly benefits future biomaterial designs. In addition, the linkages can synergize with incorporated functionalizing moieties, demonstrated in a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept example in which the sulfate&#8208;linked, saccharide&#8208;modified polypeptides showed outstanding antiviral activity and biocompatibility.

         <title>Super&#8208;Resolution Axial Imaging for Quantifying Piconewton Traction Forces in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce metal&#8208;induced energy transfer&#8208;based tension probe microscopy (MIET&#8208;TPM), a hybrid imaging approach that combines MIET with DNA&#8208;based molecular tension probes to map piconewton cellular traction forces with nanometer axial resolution. This method enables simultaneous visualization of integrin forces and membrane topography in live cells.








Abstract
Cell mechanics play a pivotal role in regulating numerous biological processes. Although super&#8208;resolution microscopy enables the imaging of cellular forces in the lateral dimension with sub&#8208;10&#8208;nm resolution, achieving comparable resolution along the axial dimension remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce metal&#8208;induced energy transfer (MIET)&#8208;based tension probe microscopy (MIET&#8208;TPM), a technique for mapping cellular mechanical forces with nanometer precision in the axial direction. This approach combines the nanometer spatial resolution of MIET imaging with the piconewton sensitivity of DNA&#8208;hairpin&#8208;based molecular tension probes (MTPs), enabling the simultaneous observation of both the plasma membrane and force&#8208;exerting molecules in the axial dimension. Using MIET&#8208;TPM, we mapped axial integrin tension within focal adhesions and podosomes, alongside their corresponding plasma membrane height profiles, offering detailed insights into the nanoscale structures and mechanisms involved in force transmission. Notably, MIET&#8208;TPM can be implemented on any fluorescence microscopy setup without hardware modifications, making it a versatile and accessible tool that promises to become an integral part of future cellular mechanobiology&#160;analysis.

         <title>Molecular Afterglow of Lophine&#8208;Based Luminophore and Its Imaging Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We discovered that lophine&#8212;the first historically documented chemiluminescent compound&#8212;can be converted from weak chemiluminescence to bright molecular afterglow by caging its imidazole moiety. This switch greatly enhances its emission intensity, enabling, for the first time, the use of lophine derivatives for in vivo imaging applications, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection and monitoring adipose tissue changes induced by the GLP&#8208;1 agonist Semaglutide






.

Abstract
Lophine, the first chemiluminescent compound discovered in history, has rarely been applied for in vivo imaging since its discovery in 1877. In this report, we demonstrate that lophine's chemiluminescence emission could be significantly enhanced by caging the imidazole moiety via molecular afterglow mechanism. Notably, our study revealed a rare superoxide anion&#8208;mediated luminescence. Our novel probes JIMI&#8208;11 and JIMI&#8208;12 could be used for in vivo mouse imaging. Compared to its uncaged form JIMI&#8208;6, JIMI&#8208;11 exhibited a significant enhancement (126&#8208;fold) in vitro and a 190&#8208;fold higher emission signal in vivo. JIMI&#8208;11 selectively accumulates in white adipose tissues (WAT) and can be used to monitor changes in WAT mass in a mouse model of type&#8208;1 diabetes. Additionally, it can assess the therapeutic effects of Semaglutide in a mouse model of diet&#8208;induced obesity. Lastly, we designed JIMI&#8208;12 with a reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) responsive moiety as the caging group and demonstrated its utility for in vivo imaging of ROS in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#8208;induced inflammatory mouse model. Our studies suggest that re&#8208;designing lophine&#8208;based probes could unlock their potential for both in vitro and in vivo applications. The ability to switch from chemiluminescence to molecular afterglow introduces a novel approach to designing imaging probes.

This work presents a tert&#8208;butyl functionalized ultra&#8208;microporous three&#8208;dimensional (3D) covalent organic framework (COF) with high crystallinity and a large surface area.

Abstract
Efficient capture and recovery of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) from SF6/N2 mixtures is critical for mitigating greenhouse effects and promoting gas recycling in the electronics industry. Herein, we report a novel ultra&#8208;microporous three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (COF), termed CPOF&#8208;12, enriched with tert&#8208;butyl groups. CPOF&#8208;12 exhibits a Brunauer&#8722;Emmett&#8722;Teller (BET) surface area of 1,140&#160;m2 g&#8722;1, a pore volume of 0.66&#160;cm3 g&#8722;1, and a uniform pore size of 0.59&#160;nm, which closely matches the kinetic diameter of SF6 (0.52&#160;nm). Gas adsorption measurements reveal a high SF6 uptake of 2.20&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 at 298&#160;K and 1&#160;bar, along with an exceptional SF6/N2 selectivity of 149.4, calculated using ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST). This study highlights the effectiveness of pore surface engineering in COFs for high&#8208;performance separation of greenhouse gases.

         <title>A Photoresponsive Hybrid of Viruses and Supramolecular Peptide Fibers for Multidimensional Control of Patterning and Infection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid of a bacteriophage virus and a helical supramolecular fiber, composed of an amphiphilic peptide containing an azobenzene group (A2Az), as a virus hybridizable self&#8208;assembling peptide is reported. The hybrid undergoes disassembly by photo&#8208;induced depolymerization of the A2Az fiber, which enables site&#8208;selective control of the adhesion and infection behaviors of the bacteriophage not only on 2D substrates but also in 3D hydrogel environments.








Abstract
Viruses are versatile colloidal materials in their biofunctions, monodispersed and periodic structures, and high surface designability. For expanding the applicability of virus&#8208;based materials, spatiotemporally controlled immobilization and dispersion of viruses with retained activity should be useful, though control of the dynamic nature of viruses hybridized with commonly used polymers has been difficult due to their strong interactions. Here, we report a self&#8208;assembling peptide (A2Az) enabling photo control of adhesion and dispersion of M13 bacteriophage virus (M13 phage) and successfully demonstrate patterning of localization and infection of the virus. A2Az is a cationic peptide with amphiphilicity that consists of eight amino acid residues containing a photo&#8208;responsive azobenzene group at the second position and self&#8208;assembles into a helical supramolecular fiber to form a hydrogel. The helical fibrillar morphology of A2Az exhibits strong interaction with M13 phage, allowing for immobilization not only on a two&#8208;dimensional surface but also in a three&#8208;dimensional hydrogel with suppression of infectivity. The A2Az fiber undergoes a light&#8208;triggered fiber&#8208;to&#8208;particle transition and releases the immobilized M13 phage with retained infectivity for the photo&#8208;controlled patterning of localization and infection. This approach has potential applicability to various virus&#8208;based biomaterials, such as structural materials and materials for photo&#8208;selective gene transfection to cells.

         <title>Hydrophilic Iridium Bis&#8208;N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Complexes Catalyze Linear&#8208;Selective, Additive&#8208;Free Hydroaminomethylation of Long&#8208;Chain Olefins in Water</title>

         <dc:description>
An additive&#8208;free hydroaminomethylation of long&#8208;chain olefins in water is achieved by using a hydrophilic bis&#8208;NHC&#8208;iridium catalyst without high&#8208;pressure H2 and organic solvent, affording linear amines with good yields and high linear/branch selectivities. This approach provides a simple, straightforward, sustainable, and cost&#8208;effective method for the synthesis of higher (deuterium) amines and derivatives.








Abstract
Aqueous hydroaminomethylation (HAM) of olefins generally requires the use of organic solvents, additives, and high&#8208;pressure hydrogen to synthesize amines in satisfactory yields and selectivity. Herein, we accomplish the HAM reactions of long&#8208;chain olefins in water without organic solvent or additives by using a hydrophilic bis&#8208;NHC&#8208;Ir complex as the catalyst. A broad scope of long&#8208;chain olefins and amines is well compatible, affording corresponding higher amines in up to 99% yields with excellent linear/branched (l/b) selectivity (up to 94/6). Mechanistic investigations reveal that water acts as both solvent and hydrogen source. The protocol can be readily extended to the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and deuterated analogues with excellent yields and deuterium rates. Moreover, the amine products are easily separated by extraction, and the recovered aqueous phase could be directly used and recycled. This protocol offers a sustainable, safe, and cost&#8208;effective approach for synthesizing higher amines.

         <title>Boosting Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Conversion over Copper&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts by Facilitating Hydrogenation and Product Desorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ca&#8208;doped Cu2O with oxalate modification is synthesized as an efficient electrocatalyst for nitrate reduction reaction. By integrating the facilitated NO3&#8722; adsorption and hydrogenation, promoted NH3 desorption and impeded side reactions, an excellent performance is achieved with an NH3 yield of 15.02&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and Faraday efficiency of 97.49% in neutral condition.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NitRR) in neutral condition offers a sustainable route for ammonia (NH3) production and water purification. For the most extensively investigated Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts that favor NO3&#8722; adsorption, insufficient hydrogenation capability and sluggish NH3 desorption hinder the ultimate performance. Herein, we report Ca&#8208;doped Cu2O co&#8208;modified by oxalate (Ca&#9472;Cu2O&#9472;OA) as a novel and high&#8208;performance NitRR electrocatalyst. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the Ca dopant with strong hydration effect facilitates the hydrogenation steps of adsorbed NO3&#8722; on the adjacent Cu active sites. The hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction between OA and adsorbed NH3 promotes the product desorption. Together with the strong NO3&#8722; adsorption capability and inhibited hydrogen evolution as a side reaction, excellent NitRR performance with a high Faraday efficiency (FE) of 97.49% and a high NH3 yield of 15.02&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 is achieved in neutral condition, outperforming most reported electrocatalysts. This work has provided new insights into the rational design of advanced NitRR electrocatalysts.

         <title>Deciphering the Role of Fluorination in Dual&#8208;Halogen Electrolytes for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries: A Case Study of New Li2HfCl6&#8722;xFx Solid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a series of dual&#8208;halogen solid electrolytes (SEs), based on a new Pnma phase of Li2HfCl6. By systematically fluorinating it to various degrees, Li2HfCl5.5F0.5 was identified as the optimal formulation. ASSBs assembled using it as the catholyte exhibited greatly enhanced electrochemical stability compared to those employing Li2HfCl6. We explicitly demonstrate that this is due to the formation of an in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated, LiF&#8208;rich cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase, not enhanced anodic stability of the catholyte.








Abstract
Lithium metal chlorides are promising superionic conductors for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) due to their favorable mechanical properties, high ionic conductivity, and good oxidative stability (up to &gt;4.2&#160;V versus Li/Li+). Nonetheless, chloride solid electrolytes (SEs) still undergo electrochemical degradation when paired with high&#8208;voltage cathodes such as LiNi0.85Co0.1Mn0.05O2. A viable strategy to enhance the intrinsic electrochemical stability of chloride electrolytes is to partially substitute Cl with F. By leveraging complementary insights from neutron and X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS), and electrochemical studies, we investigate the interplay between ionic and electronic conductivity, voltage stability, and overall battery performance of a family of new dual&#8208;halogen SEs&#8212;Li2HfCl6&#8722;xFx. All&#8208;solid&#8208;state cells utilizing Li2HfCl5.5F0.5 as the electrolyte demonstrate much&#8208;enhanced battery performance compared to Li2HfCl6. This improvement is mainly attributed to the formation of a kinetically stable LiF&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI), which inhibits detrimental reactions between the cathode and the SE, as revealed by ToF&#8208;SIMS studies. The findings from this study are applicable to other dual&#8208;halogen solid ionic conductors, offering valuable insights into the relationship between intrinsic electrochemical window (IEW), electronic and ionic conductivity, and battery performance in dual&#8208;halogen solid&#8208;state electrolytes.

         <title>Identification of a Selective YTHDF1 Inhibitor Targeting the m6A Recognition Domain for Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We discovered SKLB&#8208;Y13, a selective YTHDF1 inhibitor that binds to the m6A recognition pocket and disrupts m6A&#8208;dependent YTHDF1&#8211;mRNA interactions. SKLB&#8208;Y13 shows potent cellular activity and selectivity in breast cancer models, with chemoproteomic profiling confirming its high target specificity.








Abstract
As a key N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) reader, YTH domain&#8208;containing family protein 1 (YTHDF1) promotes protein synthesis by recognizing m6A&#8208;modified mRNA, and its abnormal expression is closely related to breast cancer (BC) progression. To date, the scarce reported YTHDF1 inhibitors suffer from poor selectivity and limited potency, primarily due to the high homology of the YTH domain within the YTHDF family, which poses significant challenges for the discovery of subtype&#8208;selective inhibitors. Here, we report SKLB&#8208;Y13, the first small&#8208;molecule inhibitor achieving exclusive targeting of the YTHDF1 m6A&#8208;binding pocket&#160;(IC50&#160;=&#160;0.76 &#181;M), via structural optimization of a novel 4,5,6,7&#8208;tetrahydrothieno[2,3&#8208;c]pyridine scaffold.&#160;Uniquely, SKLB&#8208;Y13 interacts with YTHDF1&#8208;specific residues Tyr397 and Trp470, as confirmed by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, and demonstrates improved selectivity for YTHDF1 over YTH family proteins. Cellular and in vivo studies reveal that&#160;SKLB&#8208;Y13 disrupts YTHDF1&#8208;PRPF6 mRNA interaction in an m6A&#8208;dependent manner, thereby impairing the translation of PRPF6 and inhibiting BC proliferation while promoting apoptosis. Chemical proteomics profiling confirms its good target specificity, while pharmacokinetic analysis shows favorable in vivo properties.&#160;This study introduces the first selective YTHDF1 inhibitor, serving as a&#160;novel chemical probe&#160;to elucidate m6A&#8208;dependent oncogenesis and a promising starting point for developing precision therapies against YTHDF1&#8208;overexpressing BC.

         <title>Quest for Luminescent Low&#8208;Spin Chromium(I) Complexes with Doublet Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Ligand Charge&#8208;Transfer Excited States</title>

Paramagnetic low&#8208;spin d5 Cr(I) complexes prepared by chemical oxidation from their Cr(0) precursors were found luminescent in solutions and the emissions were tentatively assigned to be doublet MLCT in nature.








Abstract
Two paramagnetic Cr(I) complexes with homoleptic fac&#8208;bis(triarylisocyanide) ligands were prepared by chemical oxidation of the Cr(0) precursors and emission spectra with peak maximum at respective 568 and 525&#160;nm have been recorded with THF solutions of these two low&#8208;spin d5 metal complexes at 298&#160;K. Structural, spectroscopic, and theoretical studies revealed that the emission of the Cr(I) complexes could be tentatively assigned to be spin&#8208;allowed 2MLCT excited states. Femtosecond&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectra confirmed that the lifetimes of the excited states were in the tens of picoseconds, which could be explained by the fast nonradiative decay of 2MLCT state through low&#8208;lying quartet metal&#8208;centered (4MC) states. The Cr(I) complexes with luminescent 2MLCT excited states were distinct from the previously reported d5 Fe(III) complexes with luminescent 2LMCT excited states, enriching the diversity of emissive excited states of earth&#8208;abundant 3d transition metal complexes.

         <title>Phospholipid&#8208;Drug Conjugates Self&#8208;Organized into Well&#8208;Defined Supramolecular Nanotubes for Efficient Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successful installation of planar camptothecin (CPT) into PC&#8208;type phospholipids enables the controlled self&#8208;assembly of these molecules into well&#8208;defined supramolecular nanotubes with varying lengths. We highlight the potential of phospholipid nanotubes as a versatile platform for targeted chemotherapy and other pharmaceutical applications.








Abstract
Controlled self&#8208;organization of amphiphilic phospholipid camptothecin (CPT) conjugates (named PCCs) selectively forms supramolecular nanotubes with varying lengths and polydispersity. Our study elucidates the underlying mechanisms governing PCC assembly, demonstrating that &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions derived from the planar, conjugated structure of CPT play a pivotal role in nanotube formation. Precise modulation of the hydrophobic characteristics of PCC linkers enables fine&#8208;tuning of &#960;&#8208;stacking strength, thereby controlling the length of the nanotubes, ranging from the nano&#8208; to micro&#8208;scale. With exceptionally high drug&#8208;loading efficiencies (43.9% to 52.3%) and stimulus&#8208;responsive release properties, the optimized PCC nanotubes exhibit tumor&#8208;selective cytotoxicity of 20&#8208; to 50&#8208;fold greater potency against tumor cells compared to normal cells. Furthermore, PCC nanotubes of intermediate length (0.3&#8211;0.5&#160;&#181;m) display prolonged circulation times than conventional liposomes, resulting in enhanced tumor&#8208;targeting and therapeutic efficacy.

The antioxidant strategy is employed to achieve the all&#8208;air preparation of organic solar cells (OSCs) by doping the antioxidant C60&#8208;OH into PDINN. C60&#8208;OH significantly affects the film&#8208;forming process of PDINN and the resulting morphological characteristics. Due to the stability of PDINN:C60&#8208;OH, an impressive efficiency of 20.22% is attained, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in air&#8208;processed (o&#8208;xylene) OSCs.








Abstract
The pronounced efficiency disparity between ambient&#8208;air&#8208;fabricated organic solar cells (OSCs) and nitrogen&#8208;glovebox&#8208;processed devices poses a major obstacle to industrial&#8208;scale manufacturing. The instability of the organic electron transport layer (ETL) materials in air undoubtedly affects the carrier transport properties, which significantly reduces the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices. Here, based on the antioxidant strategy, the stability of PDINN in air is enhanced by doping PDINN with the antioxidant C60&#8208;OH, thereby successfully achieving the all&#8208;air preparation of OSCs. Eventually, the PCE of the air&#8208;prepared green OSCs based on PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 and PM6:PTQ10:BTP&#8208;eC9 (o&#8208;xylene) achieves 19.35% and 20.22%, respectively, after being optimized by the antioxidant strategy. Moreover, C60&#8208;OH remarkably improves the operational stability of the device in air with a T80 lifetime of over 1060&#160;h, which is higher than that of undoped device (416&#160;h). Furthermore, the PCE of large&#8208;area (25&#160;cm2) modules based on PDINN:C60&#8208;OH attains 16.47%. This study highlights the potential of the antioxidant strategy to fabricate high&#8208;efficiency and stable organic photovoltaics in air, significantly promoting the development of OSCs.

         <title>General Synthesis of 2D Mesoporous Multimetal Spinel Supracrystals for High&#8208;Efficiency Electrochemical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a general and modular strategy for synthesizing 2D mesoporous spinel supracrystals with well&#8208;defined mesoporous surfaces and compositions that range from unary to multinary oxides. Leveraging multimetal electronic modulation, facet&#8208;specific catalytic activity, and 2D geometry, mesoporous FeMnCoO supracrystals are demonstrated as interlayers in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, which deliver exceptional electrochemical performance under high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte conditions.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) mesoporous metal oxide crystals that integrate atomic&#8208;level single crystallinity with ordered mesoporosity represent a promising but rarely realized class of materials, particularly in multicomponent systems. Here, we report a universal strategy for synthesizing freestanding 2D mesoporous spinel supracrystals with tunable compositions, spanning from unary to multinary spinel oxide systems. This approach decouples crystalline framework formation from mesopore generation, combining emulsion&#8208;mediated, on&#8208;surface crystallization of 2D nanocrystal superlattices with thermally&#8208;induced collective nanocrystal reorientation and facet&#8208;selective epitaxial fusion. Concurrent surface reconstruction exposes {110} facets along nanocrystal edges, which define the internal surfaces of vertically aligned mesopores. As a proof of concept, 2D mesoporous FeMnCoO supracrystals are employed as functional interlayers in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. These interlayers demonstrate strong polysulfide adsorption, accelerated redox kinetics, and enhanced Li+ ion transport, enabled by their multimetal&#8208;induced electronic modulation, facet&#8208;specific catalytic activity, and 2D mesoporous architecture. As a result, Li&#8211;S cells equipped with FeMnCoO&#8208;modified separators deliver exceptional electrochemical performance, even under high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte conditions. This work addresses a longstanding challenge in reconciling ordered mesoporosity with crystallographic coherence in mesoporous materials, establishing a molecularly modular approach for synthesizing 2D mesoporous spinel crystals with programmable compositions and facet&#8208;engineered functionality.

         <title>Tailoring Low&#8208;Miller&#8208;Index Crystal Facets Realizes Perovskite Solar Cells with Flat Grain&#8208;boundary Grooves</title>

Diphosphate Lewis&#8208;base molecules tailored low&#8208;Miller&#8208;index crystal facets, flattened grain&#8208;boundary grooves and reduced nanoscale physical voids, thus enabling 26.80% efficiency perovskite solar cells with excellent operational stability.








Abstract
Charge transport and nonradiative recombination loss at the buried interface are important factors, which limit the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we screen a series of diphosphate Lewis&#8208;base molecules, where N,N&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)amine (N&#8208;DPPM) with appropriate alkyl chains and multiple active sites not only can efficiently facilitate carrier transport but also coordinate with undercoordinated Pb2+ and interact with FA+ through N&#8943;H bond. These features prompt the formation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films along (100)/(200) crystal facets. Interestingly, these oriented low&#8208;Miller&#8208;index crystal facets have approximately a twice&#8208;increase in heterointerface energy and twice&#8208;decrease in grain&#8208;boundary energy, flattening grain&#8208;boundary grooves, thereby reducing nanoscale physical voids and releasing residual stress. Consequently, the champion inverted PSCs exhibit impressive power conversion efficiencies of 26.80%, 26.18%, and 20.59% for narrow&#8208;bandgap (1.55&#160;eV), large&#8208;area (0.5&#160;cm2), and wide&#8208;bandgap (1.73&#160;eV) devices, respectively. Meanwhile, the unencapsulated devices exhibit excellent stability after long&#8208;term storage, thermal&#8208;aging, or light&#8208;soaking.

A novel palladium&#8208;catalyzed, stereospecific, and ligand&#8208;controlled regiodivergent glycosyl Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of nucleophilic 3&#8208;boryl&#8208;glycals has been developed, enabling the divergent synthesis of 3&#8208;C&#8208;glycals and 2,3&#8208;unsaturated C&#8208;glycosides in good yields with excellent selectivity. A DFT&#8208;assisted, data&#8208;driven predictive model was established to guide rational ligand design, laying a solid foundation for future advances in regiodivergent glycosylation.








Abstract
The selective modification of carbohydrates to achieve structural complexity has emerged as a crucial strategy in carbohydrate&#8208;based drug development. However, the intricate stereochemistry and densely packed functional groups of carbohydrates pose significant challenges for precise stereoselectivity and regioselectivity control. Herein, we report a palladium&#8208;catalyzed, stereospecific, and ligand&#8208;controlled regiodivergent glycosyl Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling of 3&#8208;boryl&#8208;glycals, establishing a robust platform for glycoside diversification with versatile C1 and C3 modification. Notably, stable 3&#8208;boryl&#8208;glycals with 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetraethylethylene glycol protection were first synthesized and fully characterized. Operating under mild conditions, this reaction enables the efficient synthesis of diverse 2,3&#8208;unsaturated aryl/alkenyl C&#8208;glycosides with exceptional regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. Importantly, this ligand&#8208;controlled regiodivergent C&#8208;glycosylation offers a concise and efficient strategy for accessing 3&#8208;C&#8208;glycals (C3&#8208;arylated/alkenylated glycals), circumventing time&#8208;consuming and labor&#8208;intensive multi&#8208;step sequences. To elucidate the origins of regioselectivity control, we employ a data&#8208;driven approach integrating DFT&#8208;assisted multivariate regression analysis, identifying key ligand parameters that govern regioselectivity. Leveraging this predictive model, we pursued rational ligand design to enhance C3&#8208;glycosylation selectivity and yield. Additionally, density functional theory calculations (DFT) provide critical insights into the fundamental principles dictating regioselectivity and tunability. These findings establish a solid foundation for advancing ligand&#8208;controlled regiodivergent glycosylation reactions and significantly expand the synthetic toolkit for glycochemical synthesis.

         <title>Corral[n]Bicarbazoles: Redox&#8208;Active Chiral Macrocycles for Air&#8208;Stable Radical Cations Formation and Guest Capture/Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;active macrocycles were synthesized employing axially chiral 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bicarbazole units, showing excellent chiropotical propreties and hosting ability. These macrocycles generate stable radical cations upon oxidation and enable redox&#8208;responsive guest capture/release via their electron&#8208;rich, deep cavity.








Abstract
Macrocyclic compounds are pivotal in both supramolecular chemistry and materials science, as their preorganized cavities enable selective molecular recognition, while their cyclic frameworks facilitate electronic and spatial coupling of monomeric units to yield advanced optoelectronic and magnetic properties. However, macrocycles that combine exceptional host&#8211;guest recognition with these properties remain rare and challenging to design. Herein, we report the synthesis of three pairs of enantiopure, redox&#8208;active, conjugated macrocycles, termed corral[n]bicarbazole, employing axially chiral 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bicarbazole units. These macrocycles display strong blue emission (quantum yields up to 78% in THF) and pronounced circularly polarized luminescence (|glum| up to 10&#8722;3). Notably, controlled oxidation of corral[n]bicarbazoles generates their mono&#8208; and polyradical cations with exceptional air stability (half&#8208;lives up to five days) and intriguing magnetic properties. The electron&#8208;rich deep&#8208;cavity of corral[4]bicarbazole confers strong hosting ability (Ka = 104&#8211;105 M&#8722;1) toward cationic guests, facilitating redox&#8208;responsive guest capture/release. By integrating a chiroptical, redox&#8208;active backbone with a switchable recognition cavity, corral[n]bicarbazoles offer a versatile platform for advancing interdisciplinary innovation, with potential applications in optoelectronics, spintronics, and smart supramolecular materials.

         <title>HerTACs Enable Tumor&#8208;Selective Lysosomal Degradation of Membrane and Extracellular Proteins via HER2 Trafficking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
AI&#8208;guided design of HER2&#8208;targeted lysosome&#8208;tethering chimeras (HerTACs) enables selective degradation of membrane and extracellular proteins in HER2+ tumors. These stapled peptide&#8208;based degraders harness HER2&#8208;mediated trafficking to deliver programmed death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1), V&#8208;domain Ig suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA), and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) into lysosomes, offering a broadly applicable and clinically promising strategy for targeted protein degradation (TPD). 








Abstract
Targeting extracellular and membrane proteins for degradation remains a frontier challenge in the field of targeted protein degradation (TPD), largely due to the intracellular confinement of existing proteolysis systems and reliance on bulky biologics. Here, we develop a novel TPD platform, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)&#8208;targeted lysosome&#8208;tethering chimeras (HerTACs), which co&#8208;opts the tumor overexpressed, endocytic, and lysosomal trafficking capability of HER2. Starting from the HER2&#8208;binding peptide LTVSPWY, we engineered the first&#8208;generation HerTAC (LP), a conjugate of the HER2&#8208;binding peptide and a PD&#8208;L1 ligand, to degrade programmed death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) in HER2&#8208;positive cells. Guided by AlphaFold modeling and alanine scanning, we developed a stapled peptide&#8208;based HerTAC (L2,5P) with enhanced degradative&#160;efficacy (DC50&#160;=&#160;156&#160;nM), stability, and pharmacokinetics. HerTAC L2,5P showed potent antitumor activity and low systemic toxicity in HER2+ breast cancer animal models. The HerTAC strategy was further extended to other clinically relevant inaccessible membrane and extracellular targets (i.e., V&#8208;domain Ig suppressor of T cell activation [VISTA] and macrophage migration inhibitory factor [MIF]), highlighting its generality and broad applicability. This work establishes a tumor&#8208;selective, lysosome&#8208;directed TPD strategy that expands the druggable proteome and offers a clinically transformable approach for precision oncology.

         <dc:description>
A novel visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven iron catalytic system for efficient atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) of CH2Br2 to alkenes has been developed. This photochemical approach enables facile synthesis of valuable 1,3&#8208;dibromo compounds that serve as versatile intermediates for streamlined preparation of oxetanes, allyl bromides, and cyclopropane derivatives through one&#8208;pot or sequential transformations. This breakthrough in CH2Br2 activation under mild conditions advances sustainable halogenation methodologies.








Abstract
An efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated iron&#8208;catalyzed atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) reaction between CH2Br2 and various alkenes has been developed. This transformation provides direct access to synthetically valuable 1,3&#8208;dibromo compounds with excellent atom economy under mild reaction conditions. The protocol demonstrates remarkable versatility, exhibiting broad substrate scope and excellent functional group compatibility. Notably, the obtained 1,3&#8208;dibromo products function as highly versatile synthetic building blocks. Through rationally designed one&#8208;pot multistep transformations, these intermediates can be conveniently converted into structurally diverse derivatives, including oxetanes and allyl bromides, directly from terminal alkenes.

         <title>In Situ Click Chemistry Screen Facilitated by an On&#8208;Nanoparticle DNA&#8208;Encoded Library Identifies Highly Selective and Potent Peptoid Ligands for a Phosphatase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>

The discovery of ligands that selectively target closely related protein families or isoforms remains a critical challenge. A protein&#8208;templated in situ click strategy, enabled by a nanoparticle&#8208;based DNA&#8208;encoded library (nanoDEL), yielded nanomolar, highly selective inhibitors of PTP1B, a challenging target due to its highly conserved active site.








Abstract
Capture agents that selectively bind to biological targets are indispensable tools in diagnostics, therapeutics, and biomedical research. However, discovering such capture agents, particularly for structurally conserved or challenging targets, remains a challenge. Here, we describe a protein&#8208;templated in situ click strategy enabled by a nanoparticle&#8208;based DNA&#8208;encoded library (nanoDEL) platform. The nanoDEL enables the construction and screening of vastly large, chemically diverse combinatorial libraries with high redundancy, far exceeding the scale and throughput of conventional approaches, such as one&#8208;bead&#8208;one&#8208;compound and solution&#8208;phase in situ click methods. Thus, this enables the rapid and efficient identification of high&#8208;affinity, high&#8208;selectivity ligands in a single selection round, eliminating the need for iterative screening. To demonstrate the utility of this strategy, we performed an in situ click screening of a 27&#8208;million&#8208;member nanoDEL of azido&#8208;functionalized peptoids, in the presence of a weak and promiscuous alkyne&#8208;bearing anchor ligand. This yielded bidentate inhibitors of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B, a challenging target due to its highly conserved active site. These inhibitors exhibited nanomolar potency and exceptional selectivity over closely related phosphatases. This work represents a broadly applicable strategy for discovering high&#8208;performance capture agents, particularly for selectively targeting closely related protein families or isoforms where achieving selectivity remains a critical challenge.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Step Screening&#8208;Guided Core&#8208;Shell RuO2@TaOx Nanorods Electrocatalyst for Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the limitations of conventional experimental method, which are often time&#8208; and resource&#8208;intensive, a multi&#8208;step systematic screening strategy guides the selection of high&#8208;melting&#8208;point metal oxides as protective layers for RuO2 in acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The relevant core&#8208;shell structures are subsequently designed, where interfacial synergy promotes both catalytic activity and durability.








Abstract
In the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the exploration of highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts is essential for the environmentally friendly production of hydrogen. Although RuO2 exhibits high catalytic activity, its solubility and corrosion in acidic environments are of concern. In this study, high&#8208;melting&#8208;point metal oxides were multi&#8208;step rationally screened as protective layers for RuO2 to identify their roles in the acidic OER process. Among them, Ta&#8208;related oxide was selected as the best candidate. To demonstrate the theoretical predictions, RuO2@TaOx with a core&#8208;shell structure was deployed, which exhibited low overpotentials of 163 and 232&#160;mV at 10&#160; and 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. In fact, the dense amorphous TaOx layer effectively prevented the dissolution of RuO2 and optimized the charge transfer through interfacial synergy, significantly improving both the activity and durability of OER. Meanwhile, the operando quick X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (Quick&#8208;XAS) confirmed that Ru served as the active site during OER, while Ta inhibited the over&#8208;oxidation of Ru, correlating with theoretical considerations. This study provides a new paradigm using targeted computational screening to guide the design of advanced catalysts, and serves as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for the deployment of high&#8208;melting&#8208;point metal oxides as a protective layer for RuO2 in the acidic OER.

         <title>Electric Field&#8208;Insensitive Solvation Chemistry Stabilizes High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

This work proposes a solvophilic diluent&#8208;modulated electrolyte model for electric field&#8208;insensitive electrolyte chemistry. The electrolyte decouples solvation dynamics from interfacial electric fields and maintains Li+&#8208;solvent coordination integrity via mutual hydrogen bonding, enabling remarkable success in high&#8208;voltage Li metal batteries.








Abstract
Ether based electrolytes are promising for the realization of lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs). However, the oxidation chemistry of these electrolytes stemming from the disruption to solvent coordination by interfacial electric&#8208;field remains unresolved and challenging. Herein, we demonstrated that reinforcing the interactions between solvent and diluent to decouple solvation dynamics from interfacial electric fields could maintain Li&#8314;&#8208;solvent coordination integrity and drastically diminish uncoordinated solvents, thereby increasing electrolyte anodic stability. To realize this concept, we identify a class of solvophilic diluents (SPDs, whose interaction energies with solvent&gt;3.3&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1) to strongly anchor diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DEGDME) solvent at electrified interfaces via mutually reinforcing H(DEGDME)&#183;&#183;&#183;F/O(SPD) and H(SPD)&#183;&#183;&#183;O(DEGDME) interactions and effectively decrease dipole moment of DEGDME (&lt;&#160;2.47&#160;D), creating an electric field&#8208;insensitive solvation environment wherein the O&#9472;H/C&#9472;H bond polarization of DEGDME is dramatically impeded. Remarkably, our designed SPD&#8208;assisted electrolyte mediated by electric field&#8208;insensitive methyl nonafluorobutyl ether exhibits outstanding anodic stability, endowing 4.7&#160;V&#8208;class 30&#160;&#181;m Li||2.1&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2 LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cell with 80% capacity retention after 168 cycles&#8208;an improvement over the 90 cycles achieved with a Li friendly electrolyte. This work establishes a mechanistic framework for manipulating interfacial solvation dynamics to unlock high&#8208;voltage LMBs.

         <title>Bionic Design of Ni4+ Lewis Acid Site Based on Selective Seawater Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the early flowering of damaged plants for survival, we have designed an oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich catalyst that can &#8220;ripen&#8221; to a highly active state (Ni4+). This state selectively attracts hydroxide ions and repels chloride ions, thereby achieving efficient and stable seawater electrolysis and avoiding corrosion.








Abstract
The side reaction caused by chloride ions and the toxicity to the active site have always been the hindrance to the electrocatalyst of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for seawater splitting. Herein, inspired by the early flowering of damaged plants, we designed a catalyst rich in oxygen vacancies (Ovac) and proved that Ovac can accelerate the formation of Ni3+ and further oxidize it to Ni4+, which we named as the &#8220;ripening&#8221; mechanism of Ovac. Ovac reduces the hydrogen proton desorption energy by regulating local charge redistribution, thus realizing the rapid transformation of Ni2+&#8594;Ni3+&#8594;Ni4+. Meanwhile, the hard Lewis acid Ni4+ has strong selectivity to OH&#8722;, avoiding the competitiveness and corrosiveness of chloride ions in seawater. This work provides an effective strategy for the simple and rapid construction of self&#8208;rebuilding high&#8208;valence Ni4+ electrocatalysts, and is expected to provide guidance for the development of seawater electrolysis.

         <title>Kirkendall Effect&#8208;Driven Interface Engineering Facilitates Water Dissociation for Dual&#8208;Site H2O2 Electrosynthesis Simultaneously at the Anode and Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Kirkendall effect&#8208;driven interfacial engineering strategy was developed to construct NiZnOx&#9472;C catalysts with exposed (100) facets. The incorporation of hetero&#8208;nanocluster NiOx induced built&#8208;in electric fields and enriched oxygen vacancies, which synergistically promoted the spontaneous dissociation of water and subsequent formation of *H and *OH radicals. These interfacial features collectively optimized the thermodynamics and kinetics of both the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) and water oxidation reaction (2e&#8722; WOR) pathways for efficient H2O2 electrosynthesis.








Abstract
The direct integration of renewable energy into H2O2 electrosynthesis systems offers a promising strategy to minimize energy losses and costs. Due to the intermittency of renewable energy, the dual&#8208;site catalysts must efficiently enable both the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) and water oxidation reaction (2e&#8722; WOR). The Kirkendall effect was employed to engineer interfaces and construct a NiZnOx&#9472;C catalyst with exposed (100) facets. The hetero&#8208;cluster NiOx induces oxygen vacancies and built&#8208;in electric fields, which facilitate water activation and subsequent formation of hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals, thereby enabling a single catalyst to rapidly electrosynthesize H2O2 at both the anode and cathode. Notably, 2e&#8722; ORR on the cathode enabled rapid synthesis of high&#8208;concentration H2O2 (33987&#160;mg&#160;L&#8722;1, 33.18&#160;mol gcatalyst&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). NiZnOx&#9472;C achieves stable 2e&#8722; ORR/WOR coupling in a continuous&#8208;flow reactor, operating reliably for 4 h under simulated alternating current (AC) and peaking at a total Faradaic efficiency of 150.9% under amperage&#8208;level direct currents. This work provides insights into interface engineering based on the Kirkendall effect, demonstrating the feasibility of directly integrating intermittent renewable energy into H2O2 electrosynthesis systems.

         <title>Bioinspired Anti&#8208;Freezing Hydrogel With Localized Ice Regulation for Subzero Soft Robotics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by freeze&#8208;tolerant organisms, we develop a bioinspired anti&#8208;freezing hydrogel by embedding bacterial membrane&#8208;anchored ice nucleating protein (BMIP)&#8208;loaded microgels (BGEL) into an ice binding protein (IBP)&#8208;containing PAMAC matrix. BMIP triggers localized ice nucleation in BGEL, while IBP suppresses further growth, spatially confining ice within BGEL. This ensures BGEL freezes at subzero temperatures but the surrounding PAMAC matrix remains unfrozen.








Abstract
Freezing hydrogels at subzero temperatures severely compromises mechanical flexibility, ionic conductivity, and structural integrity, thereby limiting their application in low&#8208;temperature environments. Hydrogel freezing involves both ice nucleation and ice growth; however, simultaneously inhibiting these two processes remains a significant challenge. In nature, freeze&#8208;tolerant organisms do not rely on completely preventing ice formation to survive freezing conditions. Instead, they utilize bacterial membrane&#8208;anchored ice nucleating protein (BMIP) to promote ice nucleation and ice binding protein (IBP) to regulate ice growth, thereby achieving freeze protection through precise ice management. Inspired by this biological strategy of &#8220;selective nucleation of small ice crystals with restricted growth,&#8221; we developed anti&#8208;freezing hydrogels by incorporating both BMIP and IBP. The anti&#8208;freezing hydrogels exhibit enhanced mechanical and electrical performance at low temperatures, with a non&#8208;freezing matrix stable down to &#8722;30&#176;C and excellent structural integrity over multiple freeze&#8208;thaw cycles. When employed as a functional component of a robotic hand designed for low&#8208;temperature operation and integrated with machine learning algorithms, the anti&#8208;freezing hydrogels enable precise recognition of object stiffness and size under ultra&#8208;low temperature conditions. This bioinspired approach provides a promising strategy for the development of next&#8208;generation anti&#8208;freezing hydrogels capable of supporting stable human&#8208;robot&#8208;environment interactions in harsh, low&#8208;temperature environments.

         <title>Accessing Strain Engineered V&#8208;Fe(O)OH from Prussian Blue Analogue Precatalyst for Efficient Anodic Oxidation Reactions</title>

We present a d&#8208;d electron complementation strategy to precisely modulate the electronic structure of the VOFe&#8208;PBA precatalyst to access a strain&#8208;engineered V&#8208;Fe(O)OH active catalyst for anodic oxidation reactions. 








Abstract
Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are promising precatalysts to access active metal oxyhydroxide [M(O)OH] phases for anodic oxidation reactions (AORs). In this study, we have introduced a d&#8208;d electron complementation strategy to fine&#8208;tune the electronic features of a VOFe&#8208;PBA precatalyst. Spectroscopic studies revealed the altered coordination and electronic features of the VOFe&#8208;PBA precatalyst compared to the FeFe&#8208;PBA counterpart. The electrochemical activation of the VOFe&#8208;PBA precatalyst led to the formation of a strained V&#8208;Fe(O)OH active catalyst. Notably, V&#8208;Fe(O)OH demonstrated exceptional performance, requiring a potential of only 1.56&#160;V versus RHE for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and 1.42&#160;V versus RHE for iodide oxidation reaction (IOR) at a current density of 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, significantly outperforming the Fe(O)OH. When employed in IOR&#8208;assisted water splitting, V&#8208;Fe(O)OH achieved an energy efficiency of 60% compared to overall water splitting. In&#8208;situ Raman studies reflected the potential dependent generation of active reaction intermediates, which participated in IOR to produce iodate. Mechanistic investigations suggested the involvement of a lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) facilitated by a proton&#8208;decoupled electron transfer (PDET) pathway.

         <title>Bidirectional Electron Relay at TiN&#8208;TiO2 Interfaces Enables Oxidation&#8208;Resistant Ru for High&#8208;Potential Hydrogen Oxidation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru&#8208;based catalysts face catastrophic activity loss above 0.2&#160;V vs. RHE due to oxidation and OH over&#8208;adsorption. A TiN&#8208;TiO2 heterophase&#8208;derived charge&#8208;relay is proposed to realize potential&#8208;adaptive electronic regulation of Ru sites, spatially isolating Had/OHad and enabling metallic Ru0 preservation above 1.0&#160;V. This dual&#8208;phase design achieves unprecedented 100% activity retention at 1.1&#160;V and resolves the fundamental oxidation&#8208;driven deactivation.








Abstract
Ruthenium&#8208;based catalysts are pivotal as cost&#8208;effective alternatives to Pt for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). However, they typically face irreversible deactivation above 0.2&#160;V vs. RHE due to synergistic Ru oxidation/OHad over&#8208;adsorption. We propose a Taichi&#8208;inspired TiN&#8208;TiO2 heterophase&#8208;segregated electron&#8208;relay mechanism that dynamically balances bidirectional electron flow (Ru&#8594;TiN electron donation and TiO2&#8594;Ru electron replenishment), achieving complete activity retention (100%) even under 1.1&#160;V operation. This potential&#8208;adaptive regulation can significantly inhibit electron redistribution and band compression under the high potential induced electric field, and effectively alleviate the d&#8208;band upshift and OH adsorption energy surge. Spatially decoupled Ti(TiN)&#8208;Ru bridge sites simultaneously adsorb OHad (Eads = &#8208;1.40&#160;eV) and decouple Had/OHad adsorption domains, eliminating competitive binding. This configuration delivers triple synergies: 1) geometric isolation of reactive intermediates adsorption, 2) potential&#8208;responsive Ru0 stabilization, and 3) accelerated Volmer kinetics via interfacial hydroxyl migration. The Ru/TiN&#8208;TiO2 catalyst achieves 100% activity retention at 1.1&#160;V vs. RHE (vs. &gt;60% loss for Ru/TiN) with 73.23% metallic Ru0 preserved after 10&#160;h operation. This work resolves the intrinsic activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off in Ru HOR catalysts and establishes dynamic charge&#8208;relay interfaces as a universal design paradigm for oxidation&#8208;prone electrocatalysts.

         <title>Perfluoroalkyl Hybrid Ethylene Glycol Side Chains: A Solution to Water Related Challenges in n&#8208;Type Organic Mixed Ionic&#8208;Electronic Conductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address water related challenges in n&#8208;type organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs), we proposed an innovative strategy by incorporating perfluoroalkyl hybridized ethylene glycol (fag) side chains into the polymer. As a result, fag&#8208;modified OMIECs achieve a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art &#181;C* value of 189.78&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and maintain 68% performance after 50&#160;000 cycles. This work presents a novel pathway for developing high&#8208;performance and stable n&#8208;type OMIECs.








Abstract
The water molecule is regarded as a double&#8208;edged sword in organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs), particularly for n&#8208;type semiconductors. On the one hand, hydration facilitates ion transport within OMIECs; on the other hand, water acts as an electron trap, capturing electrons in n&#8208;type materials. Excessive hydration may disrupt the continuity of OMIECs crystalline domains, leading to device degradation. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative strategy by incorporating perfluoroalkyl hybridized ethylene glycol (fag) side chains into the polymer. The strong hydrophobicity of fluoroalkyl segments effectively repels water from polymer backbone, thereby reducing electron trapping. Meanwhile, the ethylene glycol components facilitate efficient ion transport. These findings are confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (EQCM&#8208;D). Additionally, the electron&#8208;withdrawing nature of fluorine lowers the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level, which in turn enhances stability in aqueous environments. We also discovered that the incorporation of fag side chains also promotes polymer self&#8208;assembly and improves crystallinity. Grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS) reveals a face&#8208;on/edge&#8208;on mixed orientation in fag&#8208;based polymers, facilitating efficient ion&#8208;electron transport. Consequently, organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) fabricated from fag&#8208;based OMIECs demonstrate state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art n&#8208;type performance, achieving a &#181;C* figure of merit of 189.78&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. Furthermore, they exhibit excellent stability, retaining 68% of their initial performance after 50&#160;000 switching cycles in aqueous electrolyte. This study demonstrates that a rational approach to molecular design can effectively alleviate the detrimental effects of water, providing a novel strategy for the development of high&#8208;performance and stable n&#8208;type OMIECs.

         <title>Bidirectional Hydrogen Spillover Enables High Activity Catalysts for Rechargeable Hydrogen Batteries</title>

The Ru&#8211;WO3 catalyst with low ruthenium loading accelerates the reaction kinetics of HER/HOR in acidic environments via the bidirectional hydrogen spillover mechanism, thereby enabling hydrogen batteries to exhibit excellent activity and stability across a wide temperature range.








Abstract
Rechargeable hydrogen batteries exhibit superior electrochemical activity for hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions (HER/HOR) in acidic media compared to alkaline counterparts, making them promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, the development of efficient electrocatalysts for both HER and HOR in acidic media remains challenging, as conventional platinum&#8208;based catalysts face intrinsic limitations in simultaneously achieving high activity and long&#8208;term stability under harsh operating conditions. Herein, we introduce a bidirectional hydrogen spillover strategy to enable synergistic bifunctional HER/HOR catalysts for hydrogen batteries. We demonstrate a Ru&#8211;WO3 catalyst grown on Cu foam (Ru&#8211;WO3@CF), where the interaction between Ru and WO3 enables dynamic shuttling of adsorbed hydrogen species under alternating potentials. The Ru&#8211;WO3@CF electrode demonstrates exceptional HER/HOR bifunctionality in acidic media (0.5 M H2SO4), achieving an ultralow HER overpotential of 17 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and an HOR current density of 21.5 mA cm&#8722;2 at 50 mV &#8212; both significantly outperforming commercial Pt/C benchmarks. The hydrogen battery fabricated with Ru&#8211;WO3@CF demonstrates exceptional performance across a wide range of temperatures. This work aims to explore the feasibility of bidirectional hydrogen spillover in enhancing the bifunctional catalytic activities toward HER/HOR, providing new insights for high&#8208;performance hydrogen batteries.

We demonstrate a Ru&#8211;WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst grown on Cu foam (Ru&#8211;WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@CF), where the interaction between Ru and WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; enables dynamic shuttling of adsorbed hydrogen species under alternating potentials. The Ru&#8211;WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@CF electrode demonstrates exceptional HER/HOR bifunctionality in acidic media (0.5 M H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), achieving an ultralow HER overpotential of 17 mV at 10 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and an HOR current density of 21.5 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 50 mV &#8212; both significantly outperforming commercial Pt/C benchmarks. The hydrogen battery fabricated with Ru&#8211;WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@CF demonstrates exceptional performance across a wide range of temperatures. This work aims to explore the feasibility of bidirectional hydrogen spillover in enhancing the bifunctional catalytic activities toward HER/HOR, providing new insights for high-performance hydrogen batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A General Strategy to Develop Highly Sensitive FAP&#945; Fluorescent Probes for Invasive Cancer Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the construction of fluorescent probe library and the deep analysis of FAP&#945;&#8217;s structure, we proposed and confirmed that introducing a positive charge onto the fluorophore skeleton could markedly improve the response efficiency of FAP&#945; fluorescent probe. By virtue of the high sensitivity of FQCy7 toward FAP&#945;, we achieved significant differentiation between invasive tumors and benign lesions, as well as minimally invasive foci in paracancerous tissues.








Abstract
Fibroblast activation protein &#945; (FAP&#945;) has been reported to be expressed in many carcinoma cells and associated with tumor growth, invasive, and metastasis. However, due to the lack of appropriate fluorescent probes, detecting FAP&#945; with high sensitivity in tumor and clearly delineating tumor margins remains a challenge. Herein, we developed a general design strategy&#8212;introducing a positive charge into the fluorophore skeleton&#8212;for the construction of FAP&#945;&#8208;activated fluorescent probe with enhanced sensitivity. Molecular docking simulations and fluorescence spectra revealed that the FAP&#945;&#8208;activated fluorescent probe with positive charges displayed an improved affinity and sensitivity toward FAP&#945;. As demonstration, FQCy7, featuring two positive charges, NIR fluorescence emission, and large Stokes shift, exhibited a satisfactory sensitivity toward FAP&#945; and was used for the relationship study between FAP&#945; and carcinoma cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, we have demonstrated, for the first time, that FQCy7 is highly useful in distinguishing invasive tumor from benign lesions and evaluating the precise resection of tumor tissues. This work not only reports an original strategy to design FAP&#945;&#8208;activated fluorescent probes with high sensitivity but also provides a powerful tool for precise tumor detection.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Driven Precise Control of Stacking Configurations in Covalent Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Efficiency Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>

A solvent&#8208;assisted precise modulation Zn&#9472;N coordination can control AA and ABC stacking in 2D COFs, enabling enhanced light absorption, charge transport, and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, which reveals critical metal&#8208;solvent&#8208;framework interactions and stacking&#8208;dependent structure&#8208;property relationships for advanced photocatalysts design.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) have emerged as promising photocatalysts due to their high surface areas and precisely tunable physicochemical properties. However, it remains a significant challenge to precisely control over interlayer stacking configurations in 2D COFs, which critically influence charge carrier transport and consequently determine catalytic efficiency. In this study, we demonstrate a solvent&#8208;driven strategy to precisely regulate the interlayer stacking configurations of metal&#8208;incorporated 2D COFs, successfully achieving both AA eclipsed (COF&#8208;TD&#8208;AA) and ABC staggered (COF&#8208;TD&#8208;ABC) configurations. Notably, by modulating the coordination interactions between solvent 1&#8208;butanol and Zn2+ (within the COFs), the interactions between the Zn2+ and nitrogen atoms (from imine bonds, pyridine, and triazine units) can be precisely tuned, which leads to the formation of AA or ABC stacked 2D COFs. Interestingly, the ABC&#8208;stacked COF&#8208;TD&#8208;ABC exhibited an extended light absorption and superior charge migration/separation efficiency than those of COF&#8208;TD&#8208;AA. As a result, when coupled with Pt co&#8208;catalysts, COF&#8208;TD&#8208;ABC achieved a high hydrogen evolution rate up to 10.92&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, representing a &#8764;3.5&#8208;fold enhancement over COF&#8208;TD&#8208;AA (3.12&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). This work provides a fundamental insight into the stacking&#8208;dependent structure&#8208;property relationships in COFs, paving the way for the rational design of high&#8208;performance COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Photocatalytic Co&#8208;Reduction of CO2 and Nitrate over Porphyrin Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: Dual Atomic Active Site and Nanostructure Synergy Enhances C&#8211;N Coupling for Urea Production</title>

A bimetallic porphyrin metal&#8211;organic framework with nanoflower&#8208;like architecture is synthesized as a high&#8208;performance photocatalyst for urea synthesis. The synergy between dual atomic active sites and nanostructure engineering enables an excellent performance with a urea yield of 2459.8&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 gcat&#8722;1 via photocatalytic co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and nitrate.








Abstract
The photocatalytic co&#8208;reduction of NO3&#8722; and CO2 (NitRR&amp;CRR) offers a sustainable approach for urea synthesis and environment remediation. However, there is a lack of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts. Herein, we report a nanoflower&#8208;like bimetallic porphyrin metal&#8211;organic framework superstructure (Cu&#8208;TCPP(Co)&#8208;NF, TCPP&#160;=&#160;tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphyrin) as an efficient NitRR&amp;CRR photocatalyst for urea production. Systematical investigations have revealed that the Cu and Co centers serve as the active sites for driving NitRR and CRR, respectively. The high pore volumes of nanoflower architecture can improve the light adsorption, promote the reactant enrichment, and intermediate generation. Consequently, the C&#8211;N coupling process over Cu&#8208;TCPP(Co)&#8208;NF is facilitated with reduced energy barriers and inhibited side reactions, resulting in an unprecedent urea yield of 2459.8&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 gcat&#8722;1 in the absence of sacrificial agents. This study provides new insights into the design of advanced photocatalysts for urea synthesis.

         <title>Confining the Node Accessibility of Zr&#8208;MOFs Along One&#8208;Dimensional Channels Toward High Water&#8208;Vapor Cycle&#8208;Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A principle for building Zr&#8208;MOFs with high water&#8208;vapor cycling stability by deliberately constructing one&#8208;dimensional (1D) channels with limited accessibility of Zr6 nodes to water along channel direction was illustrated. Through either shortening or elongating the core of organic linker horizontally, MOFs with high water&#8208;vapor cycling stability were synthesized. The new resultant Zr&#8208;MOF NJTech&#8208;5 shows one of the highest water uptake amount and working capacity.








Abstract
Zirconium&#8208;based MOFs (Zr&#8208;MOFs) with high hydrolytic stability are promising materials for water&#8208;adsorption&#8208;related applications. However, besides hydrolytic stability, cycling stability is also a crucial feature that renders a MOF a good candidate for water adsorption. Through a series of Zr&#8208;MOFs with one&#8208;dimensional (1D) channels showing high water cycling stability, a principle of confining the accessibility of Zr6 nodes aligning along channel direction in Zr&#8208;MOFs was unveiled. According to this principle, several topologies that regulates Zr6 nodes with chelating formate aligning in a same plane with a distance less than 5.4&#160;&#197; can successfully hinder the introduction of in&#8208;plane water molecules, thus significantly improve the cycling stability of Zr&#8208;MOFs for water adsorption. Along with this principle, we illustrated a linker designing strategy by horizontal extending the core of organic linkers toward the synthesis of Zr&#8208;MOFs with similar node alignment. By either intentionally shortening or elongating the core horizontally, both MOFs shows high water&#8208;vapor cycling stability. Among them, NJTech&#8208;5 (NJTech for Nanjing Tech University) with scu&#8208;topology, presents a water uptake capacity of 0.93&#160;g g&#8722;1 and working capacity of 0.82&#160;g g&#8722;1, making it among the top stable MOFs with high water uptake capacity and a promising candidate for indoor humidity control.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zirconium-based MOFs (Zr-MOFs) with high hydrolytic stability are promising materials for water-adsorption-related applications. However, besides hydrolytic stability, cycling stability is also a crucial feature that renders a MOF a good candidate for water adsorption. Through a series of Zr-MOFs with one-dimensional (1D) channels showing high water cycling stability, a principle of confining the accessibility of Zr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; nodes aligning along channel direction in Zr-MOFs was unveiled. According to this principle, several topologies that regulates Zr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; nodes with chelating formate aligning in a same plane with a distance less than 5.4&#160;&#197; can successfully hinder the introduction of in-plane water molecules, thus significantly improve the cycling stability of Zr-MOFs for water adsorption. Along with this principle, we illustrated a linker designing strategy by horizontal extending the core of organic linkers toward the synthesis of Zr-MOFs with similar node alignment. By either intentionally shortening or elongating the core horizontally, both MOFs shows high water-vapor cycling stability. Among them, &lt;b&gt;NJTech-5&lt;/b&gt; (NJTech for Nanjing Tech University) with &lt;i&gt;scu&lt;/i&gt;-topology, presents a water uptake capacity of 0.93&#160;g g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and working capacity of 0.82&#160;g g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, making it among the top stable MOFs with high water uptake capacity and a promising candidate for indoor humidity control.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Facile and Scalable &#945;&#8208;Diimine Platform for Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Ethylene Polymerization</title>

         <dc:description>
A versatile post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) strategy is employed in the facile, rapid, and large&#8208;scale synthesis of benchmark &#945;&#8208;diimine nickel catalysts (20 catalysts). These catalysts show boosted activity (4.4&#160;&#215;&#160;108&#160;g mol&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), enhanced thermostability (up to 150 &#176;C), and polymer molecular weight, enabling scalable polyethylene production from plastic to elastomer and wax and oil.








Abstract
The structural design and facile synthesis of ligands are crucial for the development of innovative catalysts. Advances have enabled the iterative design of benchmark &#945;&#8208;diimine nickel catalysts for the synthesis of polyolefins, which represent the largest class of polymers. In this work, a versatile post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) strategy is introduced for the synthesis of a new family of &#945;&#8208;diimine nickel catalysts, deviating from the conventional methods. Based on the commercial butanedione ligand backbone that is found in &#945;&#8208;diimine nickel catalysts, target groups were introduced into the backbone via a one&#8208;pot substitution reaction. This simple and efficient approach enabled the large&#8208;scale production of the target systems without purification. Using this protocol, 20 new ligands (50&#160;g&#8208;level) and 20 new nickel catalysts were easily and rapidly synthesized. The catalysts demonstrated significant enhancements in their catalytic activities (4.4 &#215; 108&#160;g mol&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), thermostabilities (from 90 to 150 &#176;C), and polymer molecular weights (8.3&#8208;fold those of polyethylenes produced by the unmodified catalyst) during ethylene polymerization. These improvements are comparable to those achieved through complicated and tedious aniline modifications in pioneering reports, thereby facilitating the kg&#8208;scale synthesis of polyethylenes, varying from semi&#8208;crystalline plastics to thermoplastic elastomers and ultimately to wax&#8208;like and oil&#8208;like products.

         <title>Dienoic&#8208;Acid Coupling Effect Induced Hierarchical Interface for High&#8208;Performance Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dienoic acid coupling effect is innovatively proposed to in situ construct HSL on Zn anode by the structural screening of a series of organic&#8208;acid additives. Strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of dual carboxyl and metastable double bond facilitates the self&#8208;decomposition reaction to form the organic&#8208;rich outer layer and the inorganic&#8208;rich inner layer.








Abstract
Rational pre&#8208;design of self&#8208;decomposed electrolyte additives to construct solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) for suppressing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and dendrite growth of zinc (Zn) anode confronts enormous challenges, especially for the in&#8208;depth understanding of structure&#8211;function relationship and the lack of reasonable design criteria. In this work, the dienoic&#8208;acid coupling effect is innovatively proposed to in&#8208;situ construct a hierarchical SEI layer (HSL) through the structural screening of a series of organic&#8208;acid molecules. Strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of dual carboxyl and metastable double bond can strengthen the self&#8208;decomposition tendency of trace electrolyte additive to form HSL via chemical and electrochemical reaction. HSL can effectively regulate interfacial H2O environment via hydrogen&#8208;bond anchoring to reduce thermodynamically active H2O, facilitate desolvation kinetics, and uniform Zn2+ diffusion, thus significantly suppressing HER and dendrite growth. As a result, Zn anode with HSL can achieve high average coulombic efficiency of 99.8% over 2400 cycles, long&#8208;term cycling stability of 3800&#160;h, and good reversibility under 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Zn&#8211;I2 full battery with HSL displays a long cycling life of 15&#160;000 cycles and successfully powers the portable and wearable instruments. This work opens a novel route to design an advanced interface with fast kinetics by trace electrolyte additive for high&#8208;performance Zn metal batteries.

         <title>Tailoring the Oxygen Vacancy Distribution in Se&#8208;Doped RuOx to Enhance Its Stability in Acidic Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of oxygen vacancy (VO) distribution on Ru oxide stability is unclear. We propose a strategy to tailor the distribution of VOs (VOs located away from Se dopants) via urea&#8208;assisted synthesis of Se&#8208;doped RuOx (Ur&#8208;Se&#8208;RuOx), which optimizes the oxygen evolution mechanism pathway and inhibits Ru dissolution. Ur&#8208;Se&#8208;RuOx shows enhanced acidic water oxidation activity and stability (&gt;1000&#160;h@200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), surpassing the Se&#8208;RuOx with VO adjacent to Se.








Abstract
Developing durable ruthenium (Ru)&#8208;based catalysts for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) remains challenging due to irreversible Ru dissolution and lattice oxygen instability. Although elemental doping is a general method to improve stability, it inadvertently induces oxygen vacancies (VOs), which are randomly distributed in the nanocatalyst. Notably, the impact of VO distribution on the stability of Ru&#8208;based catalysts remains unresolved. Herein, we synthesized the Se&#8208;doped Ru oxide via annealing the mixture of ruthenium (III) chloride and selenium (Se) in the air (Ur&#8208;Se&#8208;RuOx) with the presence of urea, showing the VOs distributed away from Se dopants, which is significantly different from the Se&#8208;doped Ru oxide synthesized without urea (Se&#8208;RuOx), showing VOs distributed relatively close to the Se dopants. The Ur&#8208;Se&#8208;RuOx demonstrates superior oxygen evolution reaction performance over Se&#8208;RuOx. Particularly, Ur&#8208;Se&#8208;RuOx delivers a low working voltage (1.62&#160;V@1&#160;A cm&#8722;2) and excellent durability (&gt;1000&#160;h@200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) in PEMWE tests. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that VOs engage in long&#8208;range cooperation with spatially decoupled Se dopants in Ur&#8208;Se&#8208;RuOx, synergistically enhancing reaction kinetics via an intramolecular oxygen coupling mechanism, while inhibiting the lattice oxygen mechanism and suppressing Ru dissolution, which demonstrates a new strategy to break the activity&#8211;stability trade&#8208;off in promising Ru&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Manipulating the Spin State of Fe Atom to Boost Surface Reaction Kinetics Toward Robust Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomineralization strategy was developed to regulate the spin state of Fe single atoms (SAs) from a low&#8208;spin configuration to a medium&#8208;spin state, where the coordination configuration of Fe SAs transforms from Fe&#8208;N4 to Fe&#8208;N3S. This spin state transition of Fe SAs influences its orbital orientation and modulates electronic coupling with adsorbates, directly contributing to the superior activity of Fer&#8208;N&#8208;C@ZIS in PHE.








Abstract
The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) performance over transition metal catalysts is limited by the unsatisfactory surface catalytic reaction kinetics, which involves the transformation of electronic spin states. In this work, we successfully regulate the spin state of Fe single atoms (SAs) from a low&#8208;spin configuration (LS) to a medium&#8208;spin state (MS) via a biomineralization strategy, where the coordination configuration of Fe SAs transforms from Fe&#8208;N4 to Fe&#8208;N3S. This spin state transition of Fe center is able to not only influence the orbital orientation but also modulate the electronic coupling between active sites and the adsorbates, thereby enhancing the kinetic process of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Besides, the spin polarization induced by this unique structure could also improve the utilization efficiency of the carriers by facilitating the separation and migration of photogenerated carriers and prolonging their lifetime. All these factors directly contribute to the superior activity of Fer&#8208;N&#8208;C@ZIS (Fer, ferritin; ZIS, ZnIn2S4), which delivers an impressive H2 evolution rate of approximately 31&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and a high stability over 25 h of continuous operation.

     alt="Manipulating the Spin State of Fe Atom to Boost Surface Reaction Kinetics Toward Robust Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A biomineralization strategy was developed to regulate the spin state of Fe single atoms (SAs) from a low-spin configuration to a medium-spin state, where the coordination configuration of Fe SAs transforms from Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S. This spin state transition of Fe SAs influences its orbital orientation and modulates electronic coupling with adsorbates, directly contributing to the superior activity of Fer-N-C@ZIS in PHE.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) performance over transition metal catalysts is limited by the unsatisfactory surface catalytic reaction kinetics, which involves the transformation of electronic spin states. In this work, we successfully regulate the spin state of Fe single atoms (SAs) from a low-spin configuration (LS) to a medium-spin state (MS) via a biomineralization strategy, where the coordination configuration of Fe SAs transforms from Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S. This spin state transition of Fe center is able to not only influence the orbital orientation but also modulate the electronic coupling between active sites and the adsorbates, thereby enhancing the kinetic process of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Besides, the spin polarization induced by this unique structure could also improve the utilization efficiency of the carriers by facilitating the separation and migration of photogenerated carriers and prolonging their lifetime. All these factors directly contribute to the superior activity of Fer-N-C@ZIS (Fer, ferritin; ZIS, ZnIn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), which delivers an impressive H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution rate of approximately 31&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a high stability over 25 h of continuous operation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Modular Three&#8208;Component Asymmetric Tsuji&#8211;Trost Reaction Enabled by Cooperative Palladium/Lewis Acid Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel three&#8208;component asymmetric allylic substitution (AAS) reaction was realized by cooperative palladium/Lewis acid catalysis for the straightforward construction of enantioenriched diversely functionalized allylic compounds from organic feedstocks of aldehydes, allylboronates, and nucleophiles. Diverse nucleophiles have been demonstrated to be applicable in this three&#8208;component reaction, including malonates, acetylacetone, acetoacetate, phosphine oxides, sulfonyl hydrazides etc. Finally, the protocol successfully offers a novel platform to integrate two distinct bioactive molecular scaffolds to access diverse array of hybrids.








Abstract
Asymmetric allylic substitution (AAS) reactions, named as the Tsuji&#8211;Trost reaction, stand as a landmark in modern organic synthesis. The merge of AAS reactions with the concept of multicomponent modular synthesis could allow flexible customization of molecular architectures from fundamental feedstocks, which remains underdeveloped. Herein, we disclose our recent observations on a novel three&#8208;component asymmetric Tsuji&#8211;Trost reaction enabled by cooperative palladium/Lewis acid (LA) catalysis. This &#8216;1C&#160;+&#160;2C&#160;+&#160;NuH&#8217; approach starts from fundamental organic feedstocks, i.e., aldehyde, allylboronate, and a nucleophile with the in situ formation of a C&#9552;C double bond. Diverse nucleophiles have been demonstrated to be applicable in this three&#8208;component AAS reaction, including malonates, acetylacetone, acetoacetate, phosphine oxides, sulfonyl hydrazides etc. The protocol successfully offers a novel platform to integrate two distinct bioactive molecular scaffolds to access diverse array of hybrids. Mechanistic studies suggest that the three&#8208;component AAS approach proceeds via a reaction sequence of LA&#8208;catalyzed allylation of aldehyde, olefin shift under palladium catalysis, and Pd/LA&#8208;cocatalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution.

         <title>X&#8208;ray&#8208;Irradiated Polarized Emission in Mn(II) Bromide Hybrids with Chain&#8208;Like Alignment of Halopyridine and Polar MnBr42&#8722; Units</title>

[3&#8208;IPy]3[MnBr3][MnBr4] exhibits quasi&#8208;1D chain structure with antiparallel electric dipole alignment, and the corresponding X&#8208;ray&#8208;irradiated polarized luminescence.








Abstract
Mn(II) halide hybrid crystals possess exceptional emission properties and pronounced anisotropic optoelectronic characteristics, making them highly promising for diverse applications. In this study, we present five structurally distinct Mn(II) hybrids, which either form the one&#8208;dimensional (1D) [(MnBr3)&#8722;]&#8734; chains or a hybrid structure combining both 1D [(MnBr3)&#8722;]&#8734; chains and a quasi&#8208;1D chains. These quasi&#8208;1D chains are composed of polar MnBr42&#8722; tetrahedra and halogen&#8208;substituted pyridine ligands. Of particular interest is the mixed&#8208;polyhedral compound [3&#8208;IPy]3[MnBr3][MnBr4]. It exhibits dominant antiparallel alignment of dipole moment between quasi&#8208;1D chains, while 1D [(MnBr3)&#8722;]&#8734; chains display zero dipole moment. The highly&#8208;distorted MnBr42&#8722; tetrahedra owing to strong hydrogen bonding with halopyridine introduces large inherent structural anisotropy. Under X&#8208;ray excitation, it gives rise to a pronounced and fascinating polarization&#8208;sensitive emission. These findings underscore the promising potential of mixed&#8208;polyhedral Mn(II) halide hybrids in polarized photonic applications and provide valuable insights for the rational design of polarization&#8208;sensitive functional materials.

&#960;&#8208;Conjugated chiral macrocycles with reversible photoregulatable chiroptics (|gabs|: 0.023&#8596;0.014; CPL ON/OFF) and cave sizes (e.g., 25.8&#160;&#215;&#160;19.8&#160;&#197; &#8596; 22.6&#160;&#215;&#160;18.3&#160;&#197;) were firstly synthesized, which do not exist in previously documented &#960;&#8208;conjugated chiral macrocycles. Continuous chirality amplification was realized, giving high dissymmetry factors (|gabs| = 0.023, |glum| = 0.013). A size&#8208;photoswitching correlation was revealed innovatively.








Abstract
Chiral macrocycles have attracted considerable attention because of their fascinating circular chiral topologies, circularly distributed electronic structures, and excellent chiroptical features. However, the challenging synthesis and limited cases hinder the understanding, improvement, and regulation of their optoelectronic properties. To avoid this dilemma, we employed cyclic Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling between dithienylethene (DTE) and [6]helicene to firstly synthesize donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A)&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;conjugated chiral macrocycles, including m&#8208;[1&#160;+&#160;1], m&#8208;[2&#160;+&#160;2], and m&#8208;[3&#160;+&#160;3], where these compounds displayed photocontrollable ring sizes and chiroptical properties. More importantly, continuous amplification in chirality can be achieved via distinctive multiple chiral&#8208;centers&#8208;bonding in series within helical rings, giving high |gabs| and |glum| of up to 0.023 and 0.013, respectively. The macrocycles were endowed with a photoswitchable function that is absent in previously documented &#960;&#8208;conjugated chiral macrocycles. Both the cavity sizes and chiroptical properties could be photoregulated. As typical examples, the cavity dimension of m&#8208;[3&#160;+&#160;3]&#8208;PPP was photoadjusted from 25.8&#160;&#215;&#160;19.8 to 22.6&#160;&#215;&#160;18.3&#160;&#197;, accompanied by reversible photoswitched |gabs| between 0.023 and 0.014 and remarkable CPL ON/OFF behavior. Moreover, a size&#8208;photoswitching correlation was revealed innovatively, i.e., the photoswitching ability increased with increasing ring size. Our study provides a new guidance for developing high&#8208;performance chiral systems and novel stimuli&#8208;responsive chiral macrocycles and provides ideal platforms for understanding chiral structure&#8211;functionality relationships.

         <title>Convenient Production of Photothermal Recycling Phosphorescent Materials from Cellulose and Lignin</title>

         <dc:description>
The formation of RTP films (Cell&#8208;Lig) from ionic liquid (1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium chloride, [Bmim]Cl) solutions of cellulose and lignin was achieved within 1 s through ethanol&#8208;induced phase transition. Specifically, Cell&#8208;Lig can be readily recycled through light&#8208;controlled phase transitions, and the initial RTP performance was maintained over six cycles of recycling.








Abstract
Developing recyclable room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) films using ultrafast fabrication techniques remains a critical yet challenging objective. With this research, we developed an RTP film (Cell&#8208;Lig) through ethanol&#8208;induced phase transition, achieving solid film formation within 1 s from ionic liquid (1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium chloride, [Bmim]Cl) solutions of cellulose and lignin. The phase transition also generated a confined rigid environment for Cell&#8208;Lig, activating thickness&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent green RTP emission from the incorporated lignin. Furthermore, red afterglow emission using an energy transfer mechanism was realized by incorporating rhodamine B (RhB). The inherent photothermal activity of lignin endowed Cell&#8208;Lig with easy recyclability using light&#8208;controlled phase transitions. Under irradiation, photothermal evaporation of residual ethanol triggered liquefaction (solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transition), while ethanol reintroduction facilitated instantaneous hardening. Remarkably, the initial RTP performance was maintained over six recycling cycles. Capitalizing on these attributes, Cell&#8208;Lig was successfully used for advanced coating and security applications.

         <title>Low Symmetry Cage Complexes Formed by Metalation of Symmetric Hexa&#8208;Cationic Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Threefold symmetric hexa&#8208;cationic hydrazone cages coordinate a range of transition metal ions upon deprotonation. When the cage contains ethyl solubilising groups the expected threefold symmetric cage complexes are observed, however when the cage contains alkoxy solubilising groups persistent low symmetry cage complexes form.








Abstract
Most metal organic cages are assembled through metal&#8211;ligand coordination, resulting in cages where the metal ions are part of the cage architecture, and thus have limited reactivity. There are only a handful of metal organic cages produced by metalation of a pre&#8208;synthesised organic cage. In this work, we show that hexa&#8208;cationic hydrazone cages coordinate a range of transition metal ions upon deprotonation to give cage complexes with metal ions oriented towards the cage cavity. Remarkably, a cage with ethyl solubilising groups gives the expected three&#8208;fold symmetric metallocage, cages with alkoxy solubilising groups give low&#8208;symmetry zinc metallocages, and a cage without a solubilising group switches between high and low symmetry conformations depending on solvent. These low symmetry arrangements persist on the NMR timescale at temperatures as high as 360&#160;K and in the presence of a wide range of anions.

         <title>Dynamic Molecular Triplet Excitons Tune Lanthanide Emission Lifetime</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Eu3+&#8208;(or Tb3+&#8208;)&#8208;incorporated Lu3+ molecular crystals were prepared for the demonstration of the emission lifetime tuning method using slow triplet exciton migration. The lanthanide emission lifetimes were drastically extended (&#964;max = 152&#160;ms) by controlling the molar ratios of Eu3+ (or Tb3+) and modifying the ligand structures.








Abstract
Optical codes generated from the emission lifetimes of lanthanide complexes have received considerable attention for their potential application in multiplexed bioimaging and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. However, such tunable lifetimes are limited to short ranges (0.01&#8722;1&#160;ms). Herein, we describe a method that extends the emission lifetime using dynamic molecular triplet excitons in aggregation systems composed of lanthanide complexes. To demonstrate the conceptual method, molecular crystals comprising lutetium (Lu3+) and luminescent lanthanide (europium: Eu3+ or terbium: Tb3+) complexes with two organic ligands (2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;3,5&#8208;heptanedionate and 2,7&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphoryl)phenanthrene) were prepared. These molecular crystals exhibited persistent emission via slow triplet exciton migration between the phenanthrene units. The extended degree of the lifetime could be controlled between 1 and 152&#160;ms by ligand modifications. This proposed lifetime&#8208;tuning method should significantly expand the encoding capacity of lanthanide complexes.

         <title>Optical Force Monitoring in Polymeric Materials with a Coumarin&#8208;Based Mechanophore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coumarin dyes are reacted with acrylates to form a mechanophore via an accessible two&#8208;step synthesis that exhibits exclusive responsivity to force. Mechanical deformation of polymeric materials functionalized with the mechanophore activates blue fluorescence visible to the naked eye, enabling the optical detection of force&#8208;induced molecular damage in the material.








Abstract
Optical mechanophores offer a powerful platform for the real&#8208;time, nondestructive detection of mechanically induced damage in polymers. However, the exploitation of mechanophores for fundamental investigations of deformation processes and the prediction of failure in technologically critical applications has been constrained by their responsivity to other stimuli, laborious synthesis, and limited control of their photophysical and mechanical properties. Here, we report a cyclobutane&#8208;based mechanophore that activates a fluorescent coumarin dye through the application of mechanical stress in solution and in the solid state. We demonstrate the preparation of the mechanophore in two synthetic steps, its incorporation into linear and crosslinked polymers, and its thermal and photochemical stability, establishing the basis for a new class of mechanophores with tunable spectral and mechanical characteristics.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Box[6]arenes for 3D Charge&#8208;Transfer Co&#8208;Crystal Engineering via Macrocyclic Self&#8208;Complementary and Exo&#8208;Wall Interactions</title>

         <dc:description>
Box[6]arene (B[6]A), a new kind of macrocyclic arene with flexible skeleton and bright fluorescence, has been designed and synthesized. Through the macrocyclic self&#8208;complementarity and &#8220;exo&#8208;wall&#8221; CT interactions, three 3D supramolecular assemblies are formed with the electron&#8208;deficient planar molecules TCNB, TFTN, and TClTN, showing tunable fluorescence and selective vapochromic behaviors toward picoline isomers.








Abstract
The construction of well&#8208;defined 3D charge&#8208;transfer (CT) co&#8208;crystals using new macrocyclic hosts to enable programmable functionality remains challenging due to the dimensional constraints imposed by conventional assembly strategies. Herein, we address this limitation using a new synthetic macrocycle named box[6]arene (B[6]A) with a flexible skeleton, which adopts two distinct conformations (B[6]A&#945; and B[6]A&#946;). Crucially, the self&#8208;complementary and exo&#8208;wall CT co&#8208;assembly of B[6]A facilitates the construction of 3D macrocycle&#8208;based co&#8208;crystals (MCCs) with planar electron&#8208;deficient guests, including 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene (TCNB), tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile (TFTN), and tetrachloroterephthalonitrile (TClTN). These MCCs exhibit tunable fluorescence with emission maxima at 690, 594, and 592&#160;nm, respectively. Notably, activated B[6]A&#8208;TCNB demonstrates selective vapochromic behaviors toward picoline isomers via a dual response mechanism. This study provides new insights into the design of functional macrocyclic arenes and 3D MCCs, paving the way for the development of color&#8208;tunable crystalline luminescent materials and advanced vapochromic systems.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Homogeneous Heterobimetallic&#8208;Oxide Interfaces Enable Synergistic Hydrogen Evolution Passivation for Durable Acidic Zn&#8211;Mn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>

An innovative multi&#8208;cation synergistic modulation strategy enables self&#8208;assembled homogeneous heterobimetallic&#8208;oxide interfaces on Zn anodes. The design ingeniously blends the hydrolysis of SnCl4 and the replacement reaction of In3+ and Cu2+ ions with Zn metal to spontaneously generate the heterobimetallic In&#8211;CuZn5 and the oxide SnO2. Heterobimetallic&#8208;oxide interfaces could synergistically inhibit proton corrosion and HER while inducing Zn&#8208;ordered plating/stripping benefiting from the excellent acid resistance and the abundant nucleation sites in acidic media. 








Abstract
Acidic Zn&#8211;Mn batteries hold promising prospects in large&#8208;scale energy storage owing to their higher discharge voltage and capacity. However, the challenge of developing long&#8208;term acidic Zn&#8211;Mn batteries still remains due to Zn anode instability in acidic media arising from the inevitable proton corrosion and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we report self&#8208;assembled homogeneous heterobimetallic&#8208;oxide interfaces on the Zn anode surface via a multi&#8208;cation (Cu2+, In3+, and Sn4+) synergistic regulation strategy to achieve &gt;85.5% depth of discharge with over 1000&#160;h of cycling in strongly acidic medium (pH&#160;=&#160;0.9). The design ingeniously blends the SnCl4 hydrolysis and In3+ and Cu2+ ions replacement with Zn metal to spontaneously generate heterobimetallic In&#8211;CuZn5 and SnO2 oxide. Heterobimetallic&#8208;oxide interfaces could synergistically inhibit proton corrosion and HER while inducing Zn&#8208;ordered plating/stripping benefiting from the excellent acid resistance of SnO2 and the abundant nucleation sites of heterobimetallic. Crucially, the in situ hydrolysis of SnCl4 establishes a self&#8208;regulated acidic environment without additional acidic medium. Consequently, Zn&#8211;Mn pouch battery within this acidic environment delivers a high capacity of 1.39 mAh cm&#8722;2 and retains 84.9% of initial capacity after 200 cycles at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This direct multi&#8208;cation synergistic modulated self&#8208;assembly interface strategy holds significant potential for expediting the advancement of high&#8208;safety, large&#8208;scale energy storage technology.

         <title>Highly Flexible Porous Aromatic Frameworks with Exceptional Adsorption Capacity Toward Volatile Organic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report a synthetic strategy for flexible porous aromatic frameworks (FPAFs). By Yamamoto&#8208;type copolymerization of a rigid tetrahedral monomer (tetrakis(4&#8208;bromophenyl)methane) and a flexible counterpart (tetrakis[(4&#8208;bromophenoxy)methyl]methane), we synthesized a series of flexible PAFs (FPAF&#8208;x, x = 0&#8211;2) with tunable flexibility. Both thermodynamic equilibrium and dynamic volatile organic compound (VOC) vapor adsorption studies showed that FPAFs achieved unprecedented VOC adsorption efficiency, establishing flexibility engineering as a principle for the design of next&#8208;generation adsorbents.








Abstract
In this work we report a novel strategy to enhance the adsorption capacity of conventional porous materials by engineering intrinsic framework flexibility into porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs). Through Yamamoto&#8208;type copolymerization of a rigid tetrahedral monomer (tetrakis(4&#8208;bromophenyl)methane) and a flexible counterpart (tetrakis[(4&#8208;bromophenoxy)methyl]methane), we synthesized a series of flexible PAFs (FPAF&#8208;x, x&#160;=&#160;0&#8211;2) with tunable flexibility. FPAF&#8208;0.5 with moderate flexibility and surface area (854&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1) achieves exceptionally high volatile organic compound (VOC) adsorption capacities for various VOCs (e.g., 410.7&#160;wt% for THF and 339.4&#160;wt% for 3&#8208;methylthiophene), outperforming many other porous materials reported to date. Both thermodynamic equilibrium and dynamics VOC vapor adsorption studies reveal that optimal flexibility enables guest&#8208;adaptive structural transformation, allowing pore expansion to accommodate additional VOC molecules after initial pore filling. Moreover, polar and aromatic VOCs induce greater framework expansion than nonpolar analogues, which can also enhance the VOC uptake capacity in FPAFs. This work establishes flexibility engineering as a design principle for next&#8208;generation adsorbents, improving the efficiency of VOC adsorption.

         <title>Balancing Solvation Ability of Polymer and Solvent in Gel Polymer Electrolytes for Efficient Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By tailing the solvation ability of both polymer and solvent, this work establishes a correlation between Li+ coordination, ion transport, and interphase formation in gel electrolytes. A combination of weakly coordinated polymer and lower donor number (DN) solvent enables the gel electrolyte to achieve fast ion hopping and form a robust interphase for high&#8208;performance lithium metal batteries (LMBs).








Abstract
Gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) show practical potential in lithium metal batteries (LMBs), but their development is hindered by insufficient understanding of Li+ solvation chemistry and its impact on ion transport and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation. By regulating the solvation abilities of polymer and solvent, this work explores the relationships between GPE composition, Li+ coordination structures, Li+ transference number, and interphase chemistry. The GPE combining weakly coordinated solvents with strongly coordinating polymer results in strong Li+&#8208;polymer attachment, leading to sluggish ion transport. Employing strongly chelating solvents causes complete Li+&#8208;polymer detachment, forming micelle structures that obstruct ion transport. The GPE with both weakly coordinated solvent fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC)&#160;and polymer 1H,1H,2H,2H&#8208;tridecafluoro&#8208;n&#8208;octyl acrylate (TFOA) enables optimal interactions between Li+ and polymer/solvent, facilitating partial Li+&#8208;polymer detachment and aggregates (AGGs) generation, avoiding micelle formation. This promotes efficient Li+ transport and anion&#8208;derived SEI generation. The resulting GPE achieves 99.2% Coulombic efficiency (CE) in Cu||Li cells and enables 4.5&#160;V LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2||Li to demonstrate 81% capacity retention after 140 cycles. These findings provide valuable insights for further advanced GPE design.

         <title>Regioselective Separation and Extraction of Polyalkylthiophene by Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>

We report a novel MOF&#8208;based method for extracting high&#8208;regioregularity poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) (P3HT) from crude mixtures. Nanopore threading&#8208;based adsorption enables recognition of erroneous head&#8211;head linkages, allowing precise isolation of regioregular P3HT. Both chromatography and batch processes demonstrate regioregularity&#8208;dependent sorting, introducing a new paradigm in polymer purification.








Abstract
Here, we report a novel method for selectively extracting high&#8208;regioregularity (RR) poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) (P3HT) from crude mixtures using metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) as nanoporous separation media. This approach leverages a kinetically driven &#8220;threading&#8221; mechanism in one&#8208;dimensional MOF channels, which discriminate subtle differences in the bonding patterns, e.g., head&#8208;head and head&#8208;tail linkages, in the main chain. By employing both MOF column chromatography and batch&#8208;scale separation techniques, higher RR fractions of P3HT were readily extracted from a crude mixture containing lower RR fractions.

         <title>Fulcrum Occupancy&#8211;Leverage Perturbation Strategy Enables Rapid Discovery of Potent CDK2&#8211;Cyclin A2 Interaction Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We proposed a novel protein&#8211;protein interaction (PPI) inhibitors design strategy named &#8220;Fulcrum Occupancy&#8211;Leverage Perturbation (FOLP)&#8221;. Known high&#8208;affinity binders serve as the &#8220;Fulcrum&#8221; by binding to the orthosteric pocket, while suitable moieties extend into allosteric sites near the PPI interface as &#8220;Leverage&#8221;. As a proof of concept, the potent PPI inhibitor LC&#8208;K2CAin&#8208;3 was discovered for inhibiting the interaction of CDK2&#8211;Cyclin A2.








Abstract
Traditional strategies for developing small&#8208;molecule inhibitors of protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPIs) are time&#8208;consuming and often yield low success rates due to the flat and dynamic interfaces of PPIs. To enable the rapid design of highly potent PPI inhibitors, we proposed a novel strategy named &#8220;Fulcrum Occupancy&#8211;Leverage Perturbation (FOLP)&#8221;. In this strategy, high&#8208;affinity fragments serve as the &#8220;Fulcrum&#8221; by binding to the orthosteric pocket, while suitable moieties extend into allosteric sites near the PPI interface as &#8220;Leverage&#8221; to modulate the protein&#8211;protein interaction. As a proof of concept, the potent CDK2&#8211;Cyclin A2 PPI inhibitor LC&#8208;K2CAin&#8208;3, which fits the &#8220;FOLP&#8221; paradigm, was discovered with an IC50 of 32.1&#160;nM for inhibiting the interaction. Molecular dynamics simulations and cryptic pocket identification were employed, revealing the activation loop (A&#8208;loop) of CDK2 was flexible and targetable. X&#8208;ray crystallography and hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX&#8208;MS) analysis showed that LC&#8208;K2CAin&#8208;3 indeed bound to and stabilized the A&#8208;loop. LC&#8208;K2CAin&#8208;3 effectively inhibited the CDK2&#8211;Cyclin A2 interaction in CDK2 highly expressed melanoma cells, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and inhibition of CDK2 mediated signaling. In conclusion, the &#8220;FOLP&#8221; strategy offers a novel approach for PPI inhibitor discovery and could accelerate the development of PPI inhibitors.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework Nanohydrogel&#8208;Based Oxidase&#8208;Mimicking Nanozyme for Photocatalytic Antibacterial Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zinc porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework nanohydrogel (Zn&#8208;COF&#8208;NHG) was prepared by in situ atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) on Zn&#8208;porphyrin COF. Compared to bulk COF, it exhibits enhanced oxidase&#8208;like activity and 1O2 generation under visible light irradiation, synergistically boosting bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) via homogeneous catalysis and PNIPAM&#8208;mediated bacterial adhesion, which further accelerates wound disinfection and healing.








Abstract
Water&#8208;soluble nanozymes have the potential to overcome the limitations of low catalytic efficiency of most heterogeneous nanozymes in aqueous solutions and further expand their applications in the biomedical field, but with significant synthetic challenges. Here we report an oxidase&#8208;mimicking water&#8208;soluble nanozyme based on zinc porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework nanohydrogel (Zn&#8208;COF&#8208;NHG) for photocatalytic antibacterial. The in situ atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) on scaffold of Zn&#8208;COF results in the exfoliation of crystalline COF nanosheets and assembly into nanohydrogels in aqueous solution. The obtained Zn&#8208;COF&#8208;NHG can effectively mimic photoresponsive oxidase&#8208;like activity for the chromogenic catalysis of 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) by facilitating homogeneous behavior to enhance catalytic efficiency, while also exhibiting intelligent temperature&#8208;response regulation of catalytic oxidation activity. Moreover, the high photodynamic production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the reinforcement of binding to the exterior of bacteria through noncovalent interactions concurrently boost its bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) by amplifying oxidative stress. In vivo study on S. aureus&#8208;infected murine model further substantiates the superior wound disinfection and healing effect of Zn&#8208;COF&#8208;NHG. Our work paves a way for the utilization of COF nanohydrogel as a potent antibacterial nanozyme agent and provides a novel platform for the development of biomedical applications.

         <title>Rapid and Modular Access to All&#8208;Carbon Quaternary Center&#8208;Containing 2,2&#8208;Disubstituted Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes via Cyanocarbene Addition to Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes</title>

Described is a rare example of single&#8208;carbon insertion into the C&#9472;C bond of bicyclobutanes (BCBs) using diazo&#8208;free donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) carbenes, which are generated in situ through reactions of ethynyl hypervalent iodine reagents with azides. This method is used for the synthesis of bridge&#8208;functionalized bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs), including BCP&#8208;Sonidegib, which exhibits superior antitumor activity compared to the anticancer drug Sonidegib.








Abstract
While 1,3&#8208;disubstituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs) have garnered considerable interest in medicinal chemistry as bioisosteres of para&#8208;substituted benzenes, the utilization of bridge&#8208;functionalized BCPs, especially those containing all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers at the bridge&#8208;positions, in drug design has lagged behind. This is primarily due to the synthetic challenges associated with these scaffolds. Herein, we report the insertion of diazo&#8208;free donor&#8208;acceptor carbenes into the C&#9472;C bond of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs), enabling the rapid and modular synthesis of 1,2,2,3&#8208;tetrasubstituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs) bearing three all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers in up to 83% yield. This transformation is metal&#8208;free, one&#8208;pot, operationally simple, and accomodates to a wide range of substrates. The decoration of bioactive molecules with 2,2&#8208;disubstituted BCP exhibits superior antitumor activity compared to the anticancer drug Sonidegib, rendering this method highly practical and appealing. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with control experiments reveal that the reaction proceeds through a stepwise nucleophilic ring&#8208;opening/recyclization pathway, involving the reaction between the singlet carbene species and the BCB skeleton.

         <title>A Photon&#8208;Driven Unimolecular Immunostimulant for Self&#8208;Amplified Pyroptosis and cGAS&#8208;STING Pathway by Destroying the Pyroptosis Checkpoint</title>

The proposed Bio&#8208;Cy conjugate emerges as an avant&#8208;garde molecular entity, adeptly activating the pyroptosis and cGAS&#8208;STING pathways by disrupting pyroptosis checkpoints to heighten the cytocidal impact of photon&#8208;driven immunotherapy.








Abstract
Immunotherapy is a groundbreaking approach for clinically treating tumors, but its effectiveness is hindered by the tumor's immunosuppressive environment and lack of immune cell infiltration, enabling tumors to evade the immune system. Although the activation of both innate and adaptive immunities is a promising strategy to counteract this bottleneck, their synergy remains challenging. Therefore, we developed Bio&#8208;Cy, an unprecedented organic unimolecular photosensitive immunostimulant, which stimulates self&#8208;amplifying pyroptosis and cGAS&#8208;STING pathways by disrupting pyroptosis checkpoints to enhance adaptive and innate immunity activation. Mechanistic studies have shown that Bio&#8208;Cy can target cancer cells and be transported to lysosomes via endocytosis, generating reactive oxygen species through a Type I photodynamic mechanism to destroy cancer cells, even under hypoxic conditions. Interestingly, this lysosomal disruption not only activates the caspase&#8208;3/GSDME&#8208;dependent pyroptosis of adaptive immunity through mitochondrial damage by releasing Ca2+, but also enhances the cGAS&#8208;STING innate immune pathway by releasing mitochondrial DNA. More importantly, the initial lysosomal damage impairs protective cellular autophagy, destroying the pyroptosis checkpoint and thus preventing the clearance of damaged mitochondria and amplifying immune responses, ultimately boosting immunotherapy. This strategy effectively treats primary tumors and inhibits metastatic growth, offering a new paradigm for photoimmunotherapy.

Therefore, we developed &lt;b&gt;Bio-Cy&lt;/b&gt;, an unprecedented organic unimolecular photosensitive immunostimulant, which stimulates self-amplifying pyroptosis and cGAS-STING pathways by disrupting pyroptosis checkpoints to enhance adaptive and innate immunity activation. Mechanistic studies have shown that &lt;b&gt;Bio-Cy&lt;/b&gt; can target cancer cells and be transported to lysosomes via endocytosis, generating reactive oxygen species through a Type I photodynamic mechanism to destroy cancer cells, even under hypoxic conditions. Interestingly, this lysosomal disruption not only activates the caspase-3/GSDME-dependent pyroptosis of adaptive immunity through mitochondrial damage by releasing Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, but also enhances the cGAS-STING innate immune pathway by releasing mitochondrial DNA. More importantly, the initial lysosomal damage impairs protective cellular autophagy, destroying the pyroptosis checkpoint and thus preventing the clearance of damaged mitochondria and amplifying immune responses, ultimately boosting immunotherapy. This strategy effectively treats primary tumors and inhibits metastatic growth, offering a new paradigm for photoimmunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Umpolung Activation of Bicyclobutanes via N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
NHC&#8208;catalyzed umpolung of bicyclo[1.1.0]butane (BCB) aldehydes enables nucleophilic cycloaddition with carbonyls and imines to form bicyclic lactones and lactams. The resulting oxa&#8208; and aza&#8208;bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane products can be further transformed into valuable rigid 3D scaffolds, offering a simple and versatile approach to access new chemical space with potential applications in medicinal chemistry. 








Abstract
Bicyclo[1.1.0]butane (BCB) has predominantly been explored as an electrophile or radical acceptor owing to its inherent polarity. However, its reactivity as a nucleophile remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report an umpolung strategy that reverses the innate polarity of bicyclobutane aldehydes via N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis. This transformation enables the construction of novel rigidified lactones and lactams via coupling with diverse electrophilic partners, including aldehydes, ketones, and imines. The synthetic versatility of this method highlights its potential for applications in medicinal chemistry by providing new building blocks with defined exit vectors.

         <title>Lattice&#8208;Engineered Lanthanide Nanocrystals with Tunable Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;IIb Lifetime</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering the lattices from distorted to strain&#8208;graded in lanthanide nanocrystals (LnNCs) via controllable cation intermixing (Ca2+, Ln3+), the multi&#8208;phonon orbit&#8208;lattice relaxation (MPR) between the host lattice and the lanthanide emitters can be regulated. This enables tunable near&#8208;infrared&#8208;IIb (NIR&#8208;IIb) lifetime, which is beneficial for time&#8208;resolved multiplexed bioimaging.








Abstract
Lattice engineering in lanthanide nanocrystals (LnNCs) is fundamental for tailoring their versatile optical properties, yet it remains underexplored in manipulating the downconversion characteristics. Here, we engineer the lattices from distorted to strain&#8208;graded in LnNCs by CaF2 deposition on vacancy&#8208;controlled &#946;&#8208;NaxGdF3+x:Yb,A (A = Tm/Er, x = 0.5, 0.75, 1) NCs. We demonstrate that strain&#8208;graded lattices with high phonon energy enhance the multi&#8208;phonon orbit&#8208;lattice relaxation (MPR) in the downconversion process more effectively than distorted lattices, which helps to extend the near&#8208;infrared&#8208;IIb (NIR&#8208;IIb, 1500&#8211;1700&#160;nm) lifetime of Er3+/Tm3+ by 2&#8764;4 times. Subsequent epitaxial CaF2 growth further attenuates surface phonon coupling, enabling exponential tunability of NIR&#8208;IIb lifetime (Tm3+: 0.74&#8764;6.28&#160;ms; Er3+: 0.055&#8764;9.2&#160;ms). Finally, we showcase the potential of these LnNCs in time&#8208;resolved multiplexed bioimaging.

         <title>Photocatalytic Formamide Synthesis from Plastic Waste and Ammonia via C&#9472;N Bond Construction Under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative photocatalytic strategy was reported for sustainable formamide (FA) synthesis via C&#9472;N bond construction from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste. Specifically, Pt1Au/TiO2 catalyst achieves a FA yield rate of &#8764;7.1&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 alongside concurrent H2 evolution (&#8764;22.8&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Mechanistic studies reveal that single&#8208;atom Pt and Au nanoparticles synergize charge separation, facilitating radical&#8208;mediated photocatalytic redox efficiency. 








Abstract
Photocatalytic upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste into value&#8208;added chemicals represents a sustainable route for plastic valorization. However, previous studies have solely focused on generating oxygenated compounds through intramolecular C&#9472;O bond transformations. Achieving heteroatom&#8208;containing important chemicals via intermolecular coupling reactions is still challenging. Herein, we report the first example of the direct photocatalytic C&#9472;N coupling of PET&#8208;derived ethylene glycol (EG) with ammonia to produce formamide (FA) and H2 over a Pt1Au/TiO2 catalyst. Pt1Au/TiO2 delivers a FA yield rate of &#8764;7.1&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, as well as H2 evolution (&#8764;22.8&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Photoelectrochemical analyses, including time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) and in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), reveal that monatomic Pt sites can effectively trap electrons, while Au nanoparticles act as hole sinks, thereby synergistically enhancing charge separation efficiency. Mechanistic investigations via in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) elucidate the reaction pathway: EG undergoes hole&#8208;mediated oxidation to yield an aldehyde intermediate, which is subsequently attacked nucleophilically by hole&#8208;derived &#8226;NH2, inducing sequential C&#9472;C bond cleavage and C&#9472;N bond formation. This work provides critical mechanistic insights for the sustainable synthesis of high&#8208;value heteroatom&#8208;containing chemicals from plastic waste.

         <title>Accessing Metal&#8208;Containing Species in Tin&#8211;Lead Perovskite Precursor Solutions via Molecular Strategies Guided by the Hard&#8211;Soft Acid&#8211;Base Principle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular strategies guided by the hard&#8211;soft acid&#8211;base (HSAB) principle enable precise control over metal&#8208;based species in perovskite precursor solutions. This approach enhances the quality of narrow&#8208;bandgap (1.26&#160;eV) mixed tin&#8211;lead perovskite films and improves the performance of the resulting solar cell devices.








Abstract
The properties of metal&#8208;centred species in metal halide perovskite precursor solutions substantially influence the formation and evolution of colloidal particles, which in turn dictate the crystallisation process and the film quality. In this work, we assess the &#8220;hard&#8221; and &#8220;soft&#8221; Lewis acid characteristics of Sn2+ and Pb2+ cations as a strategy to modulate the chemical environment of these metal&#8208;containing species in mixed&#8208;metal tin&#8211;lead perovskite precursor solutions. We observe enhanced simultaneous access to both metal centres upon adding compounds with functional groups suggested by the hard&#8211;soft acid&#8211;base principle. Theoretical calculations suggest that the hard base carboxyl group preferentially interacts with Sn2+&#8208;based species, while the softer base thiol group also targets Pb2+&#8208;based species. By effectively accessing and manipulating possible classes of inorganic species and their colloidal particle properties in the precursor solutions, we achieve 1.26 eV perovskite polycrystalline films exhibiting enhanced structural and optoelectronic quality, giving the best quasi&#8208;Fermi level splitting values of up to 0.95&#160;eV. As a result, the solar cell devices demonstrate efficiency values of up to 23.3% with an extended operational lifetime, retaining 80% of their initial efficiency after over 280 and 180&#160;h of maximum power point tracking under simulated AM1.5G illumination at 25 and 65 &#176;C, respectively.

Theoretical calculations suggest that the hard base carboxyl group preferentially interacts with Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-based species, while the softer base thiol group also targets Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-based species. By effectively accessing and manipulating possible classes of inorganic species and their colloidal particle properties in the precursor solutions, we achieve 1.26 eV perovskite polycrystalline films exhibiting enhanced structural and optoelectronic quality, giving the best quasi-Fermi level splitting values of up to 0.95&#160;eV. As a result, the solar cell devices demonstrate efficiency values of up to 23.3% with an extended operational lifetime, retaining 80% of their initial efficiency after over 280 and 180&#160;h of maximum power point tracking under simulated AM1.5G illumination at 25 and 65 &#176;C, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spin Frustration Determines the Stability and Reactivity of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Triangular Iron(III)&#8211;Oxo Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Standard DFT fails to capture the spin&#8208;frustrated ground state of triangular Fe(III) metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), leading to distorted geometries and incorrect binding predictions. Using flip&#8208;spin DFT, we identify the true ground state of MIL&#8208;101(Fe) and show how magnetic frustration governs temperature&#8208;dependent N2${\rm N}_{2}$ and CO binding, underscoring the need to treat spin effects accurately.








Abstract
Density functional theory (DFT) is the standard approach for modeling MIL&#8208;101(Fe) and related Fe&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks, typically assuming a ferromagnetic high&#8208;spin configuration. However, this widely adopted approach overlooks a key electronic feature: Spin frustration in the triangular Fe3(&#956;3${\rm Fe}_{3}(\mu _{3}$&#8208;O) nodes. Using flip&#8208;spin, broken&#8208;symmetry DFT, we identify the true ground state as an antiferromagnetic 2S+1=6$2S+1=6$ state that standard DFT fails to capture. We demonstrate that neglecting spin frustration in MIL&#8208;101(Fe) leads to structural distortions, incorrect energetics, and misleading predictions of stability and reactivity. By explicitly accounting for spin frustration, we recover the correct structure and rationalize the temperature&#8208;dependent N2${\rm N}_{2}$ and CO binding. Spin frustration enhances N2${\rm N}_{2}$ fixation at room temperature, while its loss upon partial FeIII${\rm Fe}^{\mathrm {III}}$ reduction suppresses this activity but promotes CO adsorption via &#960;$\pi$&#8208;backbonding. These findings challenge current computational conventions and highlight spin frustration as a critical electronic feature in these&#160;frameworks.

         <title>N&#8208;Doped Nonalternant Nanoribbons with up to 29 Linearly&#8208;Fused Rings and High Charge&#8208;Carrier Mobilities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three triptycene end&#8208;capped N&#8208;doped nonalternant nanoribbons with precise length are prepared through pentagon annulation of pyrazino[2,3&#8208;g]quinoxaline and naphthalene subunits. The longest one comprises a 29&#8208;linearly&#8208;fused&#8208;ring backbone, setting a new length record of 7.18&#160;nm among the reported soluble nonalternant nanoribbons. Terahertz (THz) spectroscopy measurements indicate high intrinsic charge&#8208;carrier mobilities in these nanoribbons, reaching up to &#8764;2000 cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, one of the highest values reported for graphene nanoribbons and the highest observed to date for non&#8208;alternant ones.








Abstract
The synthesis of nonalternant graphene nanoribbons (GNRs)&#8212;carbon&#8208;based nanostructures featuring fused pentagonal or heptagonal rings that disrupt hexagonal symmetry&#8212;has remained a significant challenge despite their unique electronic properties, such as tunable bandgaps and topological states. Unlike conventional alternant hydrocarbons (e.g., benzene&#8208;derived systems), nonalternant architectures exhibit distinct electron confinement effects, making them promising for nanoscale optoelectronics and quantum materials. However, achieving precise control over their length, solubility, and structural regularity has had limited progress. Herein, we report a versatile solution&#8208;phase synthesis of a novel family of structurally precise N&#8208;doped nonalternant nanoribbons (NRs: NR&#8208;11 to NR&#8208;29) through pentagon annulation of pyrazino[2,3&#8208;g]quinoxaline and naphthalene subunits terminated with triptycene end&#8208;caps. The longest one comprises 29 linearly fused rings (particularly including 10 pentagonal rings), setting a new length record of 7.18&#160;nm among the soluble nonalternant NRs reported to date. Strategic incorporation of triptycene end&#8208;caps and alkoxyphenyl substituents into their molecular backbones confers high solubility and a unique 3D configuration, enabling comprehensive solution&#8208;phase structural characterization and systematic investigation of length&#8208;dependent optoelectronic properties. Employing terahertz (THz) spectroscopy, we infer high intrinsic charge carrier mobilities in nonalternant nanoribbons, reaching up to &#8764;2000 cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, highlighting this novel family of nanoribbons as promising candidates for future nanoelectronic applications.

         <title>Angstrom&#8208;Scale Triangular Pore in Single&#8208;Layer Hexagonal Boron Nitride Membrane for Molecular Sieving</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;layer nanoporous hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) membranes that uniquely contain triangular nanopores with a high density (around 1012 pores&#160;per&#160;cm2) are reported. They demonstrate ultrahigh H2 permeance and CO2 permeance as well as good H2/CH4 and CO2/N2 selectivities, providing a new membrane platform for achieving efficient molecular sieving and understanding nanopore transport. 








Abstract
Single&#8208;layer crystalline films are ideal separation membrane materials because their atomic thickness could yield the highest possible molecular flux once nanopores are generated. However, the development of single&#8208;layer membranes with well&#8208;defined pore structures remains elusive, which makes the realization of efficient molecular sieving and interpretation of molecular transport a difficult task. Herein, we report the fabrication of single&#8208;layer nanoporous hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) membranes that uniquely contain triangular nanopores with a high density (around 1012&#160;pores&#160;per&#160;cm2). The hBN membranes exhibit a H2 permeance of 5.43&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6&#160;mol&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;s&#8722;1&#160;Pa&#8722;1 with a H2/CH4 selectivity of 14.7; they also show a CO2 permeance of 1.37&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6&#160;mol&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;s&#8722;1&#160;Pa&#8722;1, with a CO2/N2 selectivity of 12.3. Importantly, we show that straightforward mathematical modeling can predict and describe the gas transport properties of the hBN, providing new insights into the molecular transport across atomically thin nanopores. The results gained from this study could significantly advance our understanding of molecular transport across hBN nanopores and may promote the development of hBN membranes to address critical separation issues.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first organocatalytic enantioselective [4&#160;+&#160;4] cycloaddition of furan ortho&#8208;quinodimethanes is presented. The reaction proceeds in good yields and with high enantioselectivities allowing for the formation of novel classes of cyclooctanoids. DFT calculations point to an intriguing mechanism, where the stereochemical outcome is attributed to protonation of the catalyst&#8208;bound intermediate in the stereo&#8208;determining step.








Abstract
The enantioselective [4&#160;+&#160;4] cycloaddition for the construction of cyclooctanoids is a challenging transformation in organic chemistry. Herein, we present the first organocatalytic enantioselective [4&#160;+&#160;4] cycloaddition of furan ortho&#8208;quinodimethanes, activated by dearomatization of the heteroaromatic compound, which thereby allows for the cycloaddition with dienes. The [4&#160;+&#160;4] cycloaddition is catalyzed by a quinine&#8208;derived primary amine in combination with a chiral phosphoric acid and a carboxylic acid affording cyclooctanoids isolated as a single diastereoisomer in good yields and with up to 94% ee. This reaction concept allows for the formation of cyclooctanoids without benzofusion, as demonstrated by oxidative opening of the furan ring. Computational studies of the reaction mechanism for the [4&#160;+&#160;4] cycloaddition point to a stepwise process. Surprisingly, the stereochemical outcome of the reaction is attributed to protonation of the two organocatalyst&#8208;bound cyclooctanoid intermediates leading to a preferred set&#8208;up for catalyst elimination to account for the absolute configuration of the cyclooctanoid.

         <title>Non&#8208;Fused Conjugated Alkylfluorene Bridged Naphthalimides Cathode Interlayer Enables Low&#8208;Noise Near&#8208;Infrared Organic Photodiodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work delivers a universal design strategy of a novel nonfused conjugated small molecule, namely FNA, serving as CILs to realize highly sensitive NIR photodetectors. The FNA&#8208;based OPDs exhibit enhanced interfacial contact and augmented photoresponse, achieving a notably low dark current and high specific detectivity, outperforming conventional devices with PDINN as the CIL. This innovative approach offers profound insights into the development of high&#8208;performance photodetectors.








Abstract
The cathode interface layers (CILs) play a crucial role in enhancing the performance of organic photodiodes (OPDs). However, the poor film formation, the tendency of orientation and aggregation, and contact in the interface of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ)/CILs/electrode increase the dark current, leading to a limitation of light detection. In this study, we designed and synthesized a nonfused conjugated small molecule (FNA) with dioctyl fluorene (F) as the &#960;&#8208;bridge and N&#8208;dimethylaminopropyl&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide (NA) as terminal groups. As the CIL, it significantly modifies the interfaces of BHJ/CILs/electrode and minimizes dark current density (Jd). Using PTB7&#8208;Th:IEICO&#8208;4F as the BHJ, FNA&#8208;based OPDs achieve a remarkably low Jd of 1.12&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;8&#160;A cm&#8722;2 (at &#8722;0.5&#160;V) and a peak specific detectivity of 8.23&#160;&#215;&#160;1012 Jones (940&#160;nm), outperforming conventional devices with PDINN as CIL. These improvements are attributed to lower Jd by modified interfacial contact and increased photoresponse by reducing depletion region width in FNA&#8208;based photodiodes. Furthermore, uniform photoresponse in 5&#160;&#215;&#160;5 OPD pixel arrays further validates its potential for imaging applications.

         <title>Thermodynamic Feedback Mechanisms for Mitigating Polarization in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study unveils a thermodynamic negative feedback mechanism in lithium&#8208;ion battery polarization, demonstrating that regions with steep open&#8208;circuit voltage (OCV) slope can self&#8208;regulate reaction rate distribution, and proposes a design strategy to mitigate polarization heterogeneity by tailoring the OCV profile, offering a new principle for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
The performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is intrinsically determined by the interplay between the kinetic and thermodynamic processes, which jointly govern the polarization dynamics across multiple scales. Extensive efforts have been directed toward alleviating kinetic limitations, but the essential role of thermodynamic factors, particularly under extreme operating conditions, has been largely overlooked. This oversight has impeded the development of comprehensive design principle for optimizing LIBs. In this study, we systematically investigate the coupled effects between thermodynamics and kinetics using advanced multiphysics simulations. We identify the slope of the equilibrium potential profile as a pivotal thermodynamic parameter. Steeper slopes have been demonstrated to induce stronger negative feedback, thereby effectively mitigating polarization heterogeneity and realizing the consistent electrode utilization. Based on this insight, we propose a design strategy centered on steepening the equilibrium potential to enhance thermodynamic feedback. This approach achieves a remarkable 80% reduction in polarization heterogeneity, significantly improving operational stability. Our work establishes a theoretical framework for polarization dynamics and offers actionable thermodynamic design principles, paves the way for the development of LIBs capable of extreme operating conditions.

         <title>Synergistic Regulation of Electrolyte and Electrode Structures Enhance Ammonium Vanadate Mg&#8208;storage Performance for 100 mAh&#8208;Level Mg&#8208;ion Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a synergistic strategy involving simultaneous regulation of the electrolyte and electrode structure was proposed to enhance the electrochemical performance of aqueous Mg&#8208;ion batteries (AMIBs). The assembled multilayer aqueous Mg&#8208;ion pouch cell delivers the highest capacity of 103.7&#160;mAh among. The integrated solar cell&#8208;pouch cell device demonstrated, for the first time, the feasibility of photo&#8208;charging AMIBs. These findings provide a novel strategy for achieving high&#8208;performance AMIBs.








Abstract
Aqueous Mg&#8208;ion batteries (AMIBs) have attracted increasing interest due to their safety, fast kinetics, and sustainability. However, the development of AMIBs is hindered by the narrow electrochemical stability window (ESW) of electrolytes and electrode degradation. Here, a synergistic strategy, regulating both electrolyte and electrode structures, is proposed to enable high&#8208;performance AMIBs. Incorporating a polyethylene glycol crowding agent into Mg(ClO4)2/H2O electrolyte regulates the solvation structure, which suppresses hydrogen evolution, and expands the ESW beyond 3.1&#160;V. Meanwhile, an ammonium vanadate (NHVO) material with enlarged interlayer spacing is synthesized, and a freestanding NHVO/graphene oxide/carbon nanotube (NHVO/GO/CNT) electrode is constructed to enhance Mg2+ diffusion and mitigate vanadium dissolution. Under the synergistic regulation, NHVO/GO/CNT exhibits a high capacity of 284.0 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 and the longest cycling lifespan (16&#160;000 cycles with 95.6% capacity retention). The solvation structure of electrolytes and interfacial stabilization mechanisms are elucidated through theory calculations. The Mg&#8208;storage mechanism of NHVO based on a single&#8208;phase insertion/extraction reaction with NH4+/Mg2+ displacement phenomenon is revealed. The constructed multilayer Mg&#8208;ion pouch cell achieves a record&#8208;high capacity of 103.7&#160;mAh. The integrated solar cell&#8208;pouch cell device demonstrates the feasibility of photo&#8208;charging AMIBs for the first time. This work offers a viable strategy toward practical, high&#8208;performance multivalent&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Near&#8208;Full&#8208;Spectrum Emission Control in Copper(I) Iodides via Inorganic Structural Engineering Within a Single&#8208;Cation Host</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>

Abstract
Hybrid copper(I) halides have emerged as a new class of optoelectronic materials due to their tunable structure and photophysical properties. However, systematically correlating inorganic polyhedra configurations with emission characteristics remains challenging. Herein, we address this by synthesizing a homologous series of copper(I) iodides templated solely by the [C13H24N]+ cation. Precise control reaction conditions yielded distinct inorganic polyhedral configurations, monomeric [CuI3]2&#8722; (1), dimeric [Cu2I4]2&#8722; (2), trimeric [Cu3I6]3&#8722; (3), and tetrameric [Cu4I6]2&#8722; (4). We establish a direct correlation where increasing inorganic aggregation systematically reduces the bandgap and dictates the luminescence color across a near&#8208;full visible spectrum, from blue (1) to cyan (2), red (3), and yellow (4). Detailed spectroscopic and theoretical analyses reveal the self&#8208;trapped excitons emission mechanism dependent on the Cu&#8208;I configuration, in which the closed [Cu4I6]2&#8722; configuration is more resistant to excited lattice deformation, thereby resulting in a lowest Stokes shift energy. Furthermore, stimuli&#8208;responsive sequential phase transitions between these well&#8208;defined structures were demonstrated, offering insights into their structural dynamics. This work provides critical fundamental understanding of how inorganic framework engineering within a fixed organic host precisely controls both electronic structure and excited&#8208;state relaxation pathways in hybrid copper(I) halides, paving the way for rational design of materials with tailored optical properties.

         <title>Node Flexibility Unlocks Structural Adaptability and Guest Versatility of Anionocages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Increasing node flexibility has proved an effective strategy to enhance the structural adaptability and guest versatility of anionocages. Unprecedented, nano&#8208;sized anionocages were obtained, enabling the binding of [Ru(bpy)3]2&#8314; with a significant increase in quantum yield (&#8764;5&#8208;fold) and lifetime (&#8764;2&#8208;fold), as well as the emergence of circularly polarized luminescence from racemic [Ru(bpy)3]2&#8314; via host&#8211;guest chirality transfer.








Abstract
Due to their exceptional nodal flexibility, anionocages are promising host molecules capable of mimicking the dynamic self&#8208;assembly and host&#8211;guest chemistry of proteins. However, their application has been limited by the challenges in constructing large internal cavities. Here, we present an effective strategy to overcome this limitation by enhancing node flexibility to improve both structural adaptability and guest encapsulation versatility. Specifically, anion coordination between a C3&#8208;symmetric tris&#8208;urea ligand (L) and an organophosphate, PhPO42&#8722; (A), generates highly flexible nodes that enable adaptive self&#8208;assembly and the encapsulation of guests of unprecedented size. Crystal structures revealed that the same ligand and anion can form three geometrically distinct anionocages (A4L4 tetrahedron 1, A6L6 trigonal antiprism 2, and A6L8 octahedron 3), with cavity sizes ranging from 0.208 to 1.320&#160;nm3. In solution, controlled interconversions among the three anionocages can be achieved by modulating the guest template, A/L ratio, and concentration. These nanoscale cavities successfully encapsulate the luminescent metal complex, [Ru(bpy)3]2&#8314; (bpy = 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine), resulting in a &#8764;5&#8208;fold increase in quantum yield, and a &#8764;2&#8208;fold increase in lifetime. Moreover, circularly polarized luminescence of racemic [Ru(bpy)3]2&#8314; is induced via chirality transfer using a chiral&#8208;anion&#8208;directed octahedral cage (4) as the host.

         <title>Volcano&#8208;Shaped Relationship Between Interfacial K+&#8208;H2O Ratio and CO2 Reduction Activity in Tandem Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The M4/Ni1NC catalysts featuring single Ni atoms and M4 atomic clusters can dynamically modulate *H supply and ECRR performance through regulating interfacial K+&#8208;H2O ratio. A volcanic relationship was observed between the K+&#8208;H2O ratio near the electrode and ECRR performance. Cu4/Ni1NC with a moderate interfacial K+&#8208;H2O ratio achieves a high FECO of &gt;95% across a 0.8&#160;V potential range, delivering industrially relevant current density of 385&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. 








Abstract
Modulating surface&#8208;active hydrogen (*H) supply represents a critical strategy to boost the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (ECRR), yet the mechanistic interplay between *H dynamics and catalytic behavior remains ambiguous. Herein, we construct tandem catalysts (M4/Ni1NC, M&#160;=&#160;Fe, Co, Cu, or Mn) by coupling tetranuclear metal clusters (M4) with single&#8208;atom Ni sites on N&#8208;doped carbon (Ni1NC) to regulate *H supply. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the *H supply is governed by both thermodynamics and kinetic factors. The M4 clusters provide the thermodynamic feasibility for *H supply for CO2 activation. The *H supply rate in kinetic perspective is tuned by the K+&#8208;H2O ratio of interfacial water, determined by work function of the decorated M4 clusters. The increased K+&#8208;H2O ratio can promote water dissociation to maintain optimal *H coverage for intermediate hydrogenation, whereas excessive *H accumulation triggers competitive hydrogen evolution. Therefore, a volcanic relationship was observed between the K+&#8208;H2O ratio and ECRR performance. Among these samples, Cu4/Ni1NC with moderate *H supply rate in kinetic exhibits exceptional ECRR performance, achieving &gt;95% Faradaic efficiency for CO across a 0.8&#160;V potential range (&#8722;0.2 to &#8722;1.0&#160;V versus RHE) and industrial&#8208;relevant current densities (&#8764;385&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.0&#160;V) in a flow cell.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed trans&#8208;Hydrostannation of Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An easily accessible and cheap iron complex is capable of catalyzing highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective trans&#8208;hydrostannation reactions of terminal alkyl alkynes as well as the stannylative cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes. The addition likely follows a &#8220;modified Chalk&#8211;Harrod&#8221; mechanism; the intervention of iron vinylidene intermediates can be excluded.








Abstract
The readily accessible iron complex [Cp*FeCl(tmeda)] is an effective catalyst for the highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective trans&#8208;hydrostannylation of terminal alkyl alkynes, affording a type of alkenylstannanes that is difficult to make otherwise. The R3Sn&#8208; moiety is faithfully delivered to the terminal C&#8208;atom, unless a propargylic or homo&#8208;propargylic &#9472;OH or &#9472;NH2 group is present in the substrate, which (partly or fully) inverts the regiochemical course; this steering effect, however, can be switched off upon protection of the protic site. The trans&#8208;addition likely starts by insertion of the [Cp*FeCl] fragment into the R3Sn&#9472;H bond, followed by a migratory insertion of the ligated alkyne into the Fe&#9472;Sn unit of the Fe(IV) species thus formed. This &#8220;modified Chalk&#8211;Harrod&#8221; mechanism is manifested in a stannylative cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enyne derivatives, which has hardly any precedent either; a pathway via iron vinylidene intermediates can be excluded on the basis of deuterium labeling experiments.

The R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn- moiety is faithfully delivered to the terminal C-atom, unless a propargylic or homo-propargylic &#9472;OH or &#9472;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group is present in the substrate, which (partly or fully) inverts the regiochemical course; this steering effect, however, can be switched off upon protection of the protic site. The &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-addition likely starts by insertion of the [Cp*FeCl] fragment into the R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&#9472;H bond, followed by a migratory insertion of the ligated alkyne into the Fe&#9472;Sn unit of the Fe(IV) species thus formed. This &#8220;modified Chalk&#8211;Harrod&#8221; mechanism is manifested in a stannylative cyclization of 1,6-enyne derivatives, which has hardly any precedent either; a pathway via iron vinylidene intermediates can be excluded on the basis of deuterium labeling experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Freely&#8208;Rotatable Multidentate Molecular Anchor Enables Self&#8208;Adaptive Aqueous Binders for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multidentate molecular anchoring strategy was proposed to optimize the binders performance for lithium ion batteries. The BHB possesses a very special molecular rotation properties that can facilitate a multidentate anchoring effect to efficiently withstand the volume change of Si&#8208;based anodes after cross&#8208;linking with the traditional binders.








Abstract
The rational design and synthesis of reliable binders is a big challenge to efficiently mitigate the severe volume change of silicon&#8208;based anodes for lithium ion batteries. Herein, we report a multidentate molecular anchoring strategy to construct a novel self&#8208;adaptive aqueous binder. This binder composes of robust 3D dynamic networks derived from the crosslinking of the freely&#8208;rotatable multidentate molecular anchor (2,2&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)butyric acid, BHB) and polyacrylic acid (PAA) via dynamic hydrogen&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly, which effectively imparts the fabrication of high&#8208;strength Si/C anodes and achieves high areal capacities (6.13&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2) under a high mass loading of 13&#160;mg cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the dynamic and reversible adhesion and the efficient &#8220;net&#8208;to&#8208;point&#8221; bonding characteristic contribute to enhance structural and interfacial stability in the NCM811/Si/C full cells. Consequently, the cells demonstrate superior cyclability and electrochemical performance. Notably, this multidentate molecular anchoring strategy can be further extended to develop other BHB&#8208;derived self&#8208;adaptive binders (i.e., BHB/PVA and BHB/CMC) for the purpose of dynamic structure regulation. This work provides valuable insights into the judicious modulation of aqueous binders from the perspective of molecular chemistry and product engineering, paving the pathway for the design of auqeous binders for ultra&#8208;high&#8208;energy Si&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Stereoselective Self&#8208;Assembly of a Topologically Chiral [6]Catenane with 18 Crossings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereoselective construction of a record&#8208;complex 24&#8208;metal [6]catenane (1816$18_1^6$ link) with 18 crossings is achieved via one&#8208;step coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. Chirality transfer from enantiopure ligands enables exclusive formation of topological enantiomers, each featuring four topologically chiral stereogenic units. Synergistic &#960;&#8208;stacking, hydrogen bonding, and solvophobic effects direct the formation of this six&#8208;ring entangled architecture. 








Abstract
Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) exhibit unique properties and functions arising from their structural entanglement, features of which are absent in their individual components. However, synthesizing topologically complex architectures, particularly those with topological chirality, remains a significant challenge due to the lack of general methods for controlled entanglement. Herein, we report the stereoselective synthesis of a 24&#8208;metal&#8208;center topologically chiral [6]catenane featuring 18 crossings (1816$18_1^6$ link), representing one of the most intricate MIMs constructed to date. This complex architecture was achieved in high yield (71%) via one&#8208;step coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of 12 chiral semirigid bidentate ligands and 12 conjugated binuclear half&#8208;sandwich organometallic clips. Critically, chirality transfer from enantiopure ligands enabled exclusive formation of topological enantiomer pairs (Rh&#8208;1S/Rh&#8208;1R), each containing four topologically chiral stereogenic units&#8212;three cyclic [3]catenane components and one closed three&#8208;link chain component. The self&#8208;assembly is synergistically directed by integrated noncovalent interactions (sevenfold &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, hydrogen bonding, and solvophobic effects), as unambiguously confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This design strategy, incorporating tailored noncovalent interaction sites in building blocks, provides a viable approach for synthesizing other structurally complex topologically chiral MIMs.

         <title>Solvent Polarity Triggered Rapidly Reversible Quadruple&#8208;Mode Luminescence Adjustment in 0D Hybrid Antimony Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zero&#8208;dimensional metal halide demonstrates quadruple/triple&#8208;mode luminescence switching with a rapid response (&lt;1s) and excellent recyclability (&#8805;100 cycles) triggered with moderately&#8208;polar and strongly&#8208;polar solvents. The solvochromism mechanism links luminescence tuning to solvent polarity, with dipole moment changed from moderately&#8208;polar solvents, and phase transformation induced by strongly&#8208;polar solvents. This crystal shows potential for solvent detection, safety monitoring, and information encryption.








Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimension (0D) organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid metal halides are highly attractive as smart responsive luminescent materials, but the multiple&#8208;mode luminescence switch is rarely achieved and intrinsic solvochromism mechanism is unclear. Herein, we report a yellowish&#8208;green&#8208;emitting (Me3BzN)3Sb2Cl9 (Me3BzN: trimethylbenzyl ammonium) single crystal, revealing quadruple/triple&#8208;mode luminescence switch with rapid response time (&lt;1&#160;s) and excellent recyclability (&#8805; 100 cycles) when triggered by moderately&#8208;polar and strongly&#8208;polar solvents. Significantly, the intrinsic solvochromism mechanism is systematically proposed, of which the reversibly multiple&#8208;mode luminescence tuning is closely related to solvent polarity, the moderate polarity can lead to luminescence redshift from 560 to 670&#160;nm due to the increase of dipole moment for inorganic polyhedron. Besides, the small molecular solvent with strong polarity can insert into crystal and form &#8220;host&#8208;guest&#8221; system, inducing single crystal&#8208;single crystal phase transformation with structural disorder and Sb&#8208;Sb distance variation. Owing to the unique multiple&#8208;mode luminescence adjustment performance, (Me3BzN)3Sb2Cl9 displays potential candidate in solvent detection, safety monitoring and information encryption scenarios. These findings highlight the significance of solvent polarity and molecule volume on the dynamic luminescence adjustment and offer guidance for the development of new smart responsive 0D hybrid antimony halides in advanced optical switchable fields.

         <title>White Circularly Polarized OLEDs Enabled by Orthogonal Engineering of Achiral Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters and Chiral Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A promising strategy by orthogonal engineering of achiral blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters and chiral orange assemblies was proposed to fabricate white circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs). This strategy leverages the high exciton utilization and chiral amplification, yielding a record gEL of 0.34 and EQEmax of 6.3%. This work represented the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art white CP&#8208;OLEDs, delivering the highest reported combination of external quantum efficiency (EQE) and gEL to date. 








Abstract
The development of white circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) faces a critical challenge in simultaneously achieving high external quantum efficiency (EQE) and large dissymmetry factors (g), due to the inherent trade&#8208;off between exciton utilization and chirality amplification. Herein, we propose an orthogonal architecture synergizing an achiral blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitter with chiral orange assemblies to overcome this limitation. The chiral assemblies, featuring exceptional chiroptical activity (|gabs| = 0.95 and |glum| = 0.85), are engineered as both photon&#8208;selective filters and emitters. When integrated with a blue TADF layer, this dual&#8208;layer design enables 100% internal quantum efficiency through TADF&#8208;enabled triplet harvesting and chiral amplification via selective absorption of blue photons with a specific polarization direction, generating amplified white circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL). The resulting white CP&#8208;OLED (CIE: 0.31, 0.34) achieves a record |gEL| of 0.34 alongside an EQEmax of 6.3%, demonstrating the unprecedented white CP&#8208;OLEDs when considering both EQE and gEL values. By optimizing the TADF doping ratio, a cool&#8208;white CP&#8208;OLED is realized with an EQE of 14.7% and |gEL| of 0.32. This work establishes a material orthogonal engineering to decouple exciton&#8208;chirality interdependencies, opening avenues for fabricating high&#8208;performance CPEL devices.

&lt;sub&gt;EL&lt;/sub&gt; to date. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of white circularly polarized organic light-emitting diodes (CP-OLEDs) faces a critical challenge in simultaneously achieving high external quantum efficiency (EQE) and large dissymmetry factors (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;), due to the inherent trade-off between exciton utilization and chirality amplification. Herein, we propose an orthogonal architecture synergizing an achiral blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitter with chiral orange assemblies to overcome this limitation. The chiral assemblies, featuring exceptional chiroptical activity (|&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;abs&lt;/sub&gt;| = 0.95 and |&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;| = 0.85), are engineered as both photon-selective filters and emitters. When integrated with a blue TADF layer, this dual-layer design enables 100% internal quantum efficiency through TADF-enabled triplet harvesting and chiral amplification via selective absorption of blue photons with a specific polarization direction, generating amplified white circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL). The resulting white CP-OLED (CIE: 0.31, 0.34) achieves a record |&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;EL&lt;/sub&gt;| of 0.34 alongside an EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 6.3%, demonstrating the unprecedented white CP-OLEDs when considering both EQE and &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;EL&lt;/sub&gt; values. By optimizing the TADF doping ratio, a cool-white CP-OLED is realized with an EQE of 14.7% and |&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;EL&lt;/sub&gt;| of 0.32. This work establishes a material orthogonal engineering to decouple exciton-chirality interdependencies, opening avenues for fabricating high-performance CPEL devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lewis&#8211;Br&#248;nsted Dual Acid Sites in WO3&#8208;x Catalysts Facilitate Direct Photocatalytic Hydrodeoxygenation of Hydroxy Groups in Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polarity enhancement strategy has been developed to realize the direct photocatalytic hydrodeoxygenation of different alcohols under ambient conditions. A WO3&#8208;x catalyst possessing Lewis&#8211;Br&#248;nsted dual acid sites is developed to drive the whole reaction. The Lewis&#8211;Br&#248;nsted dual acid sites have been&#160;demonstrated to be the main sites for the photocatalytic hydrodeoxygenation of hydroxy groups.








Abstract
Efficient hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of the hydroxy groups (C&#9472;OH) in alcohol molecules has attracted substantial attention due to its importance in many research fields such as organic synthesis and biomass conversion. Photocatalytic C&#9472;OH direct HDO is a promising but challenging process because of the difficulty in C&#9472;O bond activation due to the higher bond energy and strong polarity. A polarity enhancement strategy is proposed and a WO3&#8208;x catalyst possessing Lewis&#8211;Br&#248;nsted dual acid sites is developed to realize the direct HDO of alcohols under ambient conditions. The C&#9472;O bond is first heterolytic cleaved to produce the carbocation intermediate and then the carbocation will combine with a proton and photogenerated electrons to form a new C&#9472;H bond. The synergistic effect of Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acid sites plays a key role in promoting the C&#9472;O bond cleavage. A series of comparative experiments, spectral characterizations&#160;and DFT calculations were&#160;used to demonstrate this new photocatalytic HDO pathway. Different alcohols, including polyols, can be directly converted into corresponding alkanes over this system. The present work discloses a direct HDO process for the hydroxy groups in alcohols and provides a new horizon for the design of new photocatalytic systems.

         <title>Force&#8208;Induced Ring Flipping in a Threaded Pillar[5]Arene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical force was used to flip the orientation of a hydroquinone ring in a threaded pillar[5]arene to reach an elusive conformation not accessible to other methods of activation. The flipping can be suppressed with large substituents on the axle or the macrocycle. This unique molecular motion provides a new mechanism to dissipate mechanical energy with rotaxanes.








Abstract
Pillar[n]arenes are popular macrocycles used in various supramolecular systems and materials due to their unique host&#8211;guest properties and ease of synthesis. Their pillar shape originates from the cyclic arrangement of methylene&#8208;bridged hydroquinone groups. They usually exist in one of two conformations where all the hydroquinone rings are oriented in the same direction (left or right), which is the source of their planar chirality. However, the controlled formation of pillar[n]arenes with intermediate conformations, for example, where only one ring is inverted, remains a challenge. Here we show how mechanical force can be used to reach this elusive conformation via the force&#8208;induced flipping of a single hydroquinone ring in a pillar[5]arene&#8208;based rotaxane. We show that the flipping motion can be controlled with the shape of the stopper and the axle, as well as with the nature of the pillar[5]arene substituents. This flipping behavior acts as a mechanical damper by slowing the scission of the polymer under tension. These results show how mechanical force can be used to access synthetically challenging supramolecular architectures, and we anticipate that this new dampening mechanism will prove useful in the formation of tougher materials.

         <title>Probing Photoelectrochemical Hydrogen and Oxygen Evolution at Individual Al:SrTiO3/Rh2&#8211;yCryO3 Photocatalyst Particles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;SECM was used to probe the photocurrent and to map H2 and O2 evolution rates during water splitting on individual Al:SrTiO3/Rh2&#8722;yCryO3 photocatalyst particles, observing catalytic heterogeneity on the microscale.








Abstract
Particle&#8208;based photocatalysts for overall water splitting convert solar energy into hydrogen fuel without the use of any photovoltaic devices. As such they have the potential to revolutionize renewable energy production on Earth. While proven efficiencies have reached 1.1%, further improvements of photocatalyst technology depend on a better understanding of energy loss mechanisms on the individual particle level. Here, we conduct the first in operando photoelectrochemical measurements on individual micrometer&#8208;sized Al&#8208;doped SrTiO3/Rh2&#8211;yCryO3 photocatalyst particles. We find that the photocatalyst particles behave mainly as water oxidation photoanodes reaching up to 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 0.8&#160;V versus RHE and a photovoltage of &#8764;1.00 V under 4.7&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 ultraviolet illumination. This proves that charge separation in the unbiased Al:SrTiO3/Rh2&#8211;yCryO3 catalyst is driven by a junction at the n&#8208;semiconductor&#8208;liquid contact. While O2 is detected symmetrically around photocatalyst particles, uneven H2 evolution profiles reflect an irregular Rh2&#8211;yCryO3 cocatalyst distribution. Additionally, the H2 evolution activity varies significantly between different photocatalyst particles. This suggests that performance gains are possible by better controlling catalyst composition on the microscale.

         <title>Abnormal Anti&#8208;Kasha Emission and TADF in Anionic Cycloarylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The removal of {FeCp} moieties in two ferrocene&#8208;dopped cycloarylenes via reductive cleavage approach unveils the intrinsic optical properties of anionic cycloarylenes. 13&#8211; exhibits a mixed emission from S2&#8594;S0 and S1'&#8594;S0, while 24&#8211; follows Kasha's rule displaying an S1'&#8594;S0 emission, notably, both anionic cycloarylenes display thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) with lifetimes on the millisecond scale.








Abstract
Incorporation of non&#8208;benzoid rings into cycloarylenes significantly alters their molecular geometry and optical behavior. Recently, we synthesized two ferrocene&#8208;doped cycloarylenes, (CpFe)3&#8208;1 and (CpFe)4&#8208;2. However, the {FeCp} moieties in these architectures limited their optical properties. In this work, we report a reductive Fe&#9472;Cp bond cleavage approach that enables the removal of {FeCp} moieties efficiently, yielding two anionic cycloarylenes, 13&#8211; and 24&#8211;. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis reveals different structure deformation between two charged species including molecular symmetry and &#960;&#8208;conjugation. Comprehensive spectroscopic analyses and theoretical calculations demonstrate that both 13&#8211; and 24&#8211; exhibit steady emission at 560 and 587&#160;nm, respectively, with noticeable high quantum yields (59.70% and 84.99%). 13&#8211; violates Kasha's rule via a rare mixed emission from S2&#8594;S0 and S1'&#8594;S0, whereas 24&#8211; adheres to the conventional S1'&#8594;S0 decay. Furthermore, both compounds exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) as the first example observed in cycloarylenes, with lifetimes reaching the millisecond scale. This work establishes alkali&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated reductive cleavage as an effective strategy to break Fe&#9472;Cp bond and provides new insight into the photophysical behavior of charged molecular nanocarbons, paving the way for the rational design of functional molecular materials.

&lt;sup&gt;3&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; exhibits a mixed emission from S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'&#8594;S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, while &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; follows Kasha's rule displaying an S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'&#8594;S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; emission, notably, both anionic cycloarylenes display thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) with lifetimes on the millisecond scale.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incorporation of non-benzoid rings into cycloarylenes significantly alters their molecular geometry and optical behavior. Recently, we synthesized two ferrocene-doped cycloarylenes, &lt;b&gt;(CpFe)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;(CpFe)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-2&lt;/b&gt;. However, the {FeCp} moieties in these architectures limited their optical properties. In this work, we report a reductive Fe&#9472;Cp bond cleavage approach that enables the removal of {FeCp} moieties efficiently, yielding two anionic cycloarylenes, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt;. Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals different structure deformation between two charged species including molecular symmetry and &#960;-conjugation. Comprehensive spectroscopic analyses and theoretical calculations demonstrate that both &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; exhibit steady emission at 560 and 587&#160;nm, respectively, with noticeable high quantum yields (59.70% and 84.99%). &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; violates Kasha's rule via a rare mixed emission from S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'&#8594;S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, whereas &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; adheres to the conventional S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'&#8594;S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; decay. Furthermore, both compounds exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) as the first example observed in cycloarylenes, with lifetimes reaching the millisecond scale. This work establishes alkali-metal-mediated reductive cleavage as an effective strategy to break Fe&#9472;Cp bond and provides new insight into the photophysical behavior of charged molecular nanocarbons, paving the way for the rational design of functional molecular materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanochemical Degradation of Polystyrene Into Benzene for Recycling and Upcycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical degradation of polystyrene into benzene through ball milling is demonstrated for the first time. The benzene generated can be used to synthesize the styrene monomer for a closed&#8208;loop recycling or be converted into benzophenone through a mechanochemical cascade Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation for upcycling.








Abstract
Synthetic plastics sourced from petroleum have gained widespread use since the 1950s. Polystyrene (PS) is one of the most extensively used plastics, as it is colorless, has high mechanical strength, and exhibits excellent chemical and thermal stability; however, it is also one of the least recycled plastics because of the high cost and low profit in recycling. Herein, we demonstrate a mechanochemical recycling approach that allows PS to be efficiently degraded into benzene when it is ground in a ball mill with AlCl3. For example, when 165&#160;kDa PS pellets are milled with AlCl3, the extent of degradation reaches 90% at 15&#160;min. Isotope labeling experiments indicate that both ambient water and the polymer backbone can be proton sources for the formation of benzene. The benzene generated in the mechanochemical degradation can be used to synthesize styrene, which can be repolymerized to produce polystyrene, allowing for the closed&#8208;loop recycling of PS. In addition, a mechanochemical Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation between the generated benzene and the subsequently added benzoic anhydride produces benzophenone in 40%&#8211;50% yield. The mechanochemical degradation process demonstrated here is solvent&#8208;free, cost&#8208;effective, and energy&#8208;efficient, providing a promising route for the chemical recycling and upcycling of PS.

         <title>Design and Preparation of Self&#8208;Adaptive and Robust Solid&#8208;State Elastomeric Electrolyte for Lithium Metal Battery Inspired by Rubber Tire</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;adaptive solid&#8208;state elastomeric electrolyte inspired by rubber tires is designed, combining molecular&#8208;level plasticizer dispersion, mechanical flexibility, and interfacial adaptivity. By optimizing the elastomer&#8208;to&#8208;DEE ratio and integrating a polyethylene scaffold, the SSEE achieves high ionic conductivity (2.37 mS cm&#8722;1) and low interfacial resistance. It retains 88.33% capacity after 800 cycles in full&#8208;cell configurations.








Abstract
The development of safe, high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state electrolytes remains a central challenge for advancing lithium metal batteries (LMBs) toward practical deployment. Inspired by the durable, deformable nature of rubber tires, we report the design and preparation of a self&#8208;adaptive solid&#8208;state elastomeric electrolyte containing a deep eutectic electrolyte, termed PMEC, which integrates molecular&#8208;level plasticizer dispersion, mechanical flexibility, and interfacial adaptivity. The PMEC membrane exhibits high ionic conductivity (2.37 mS cm&#8722;1 at 30 &#176;C), a high Li&#8314; transference number (0.64), excellent elasticity, and robust interfacial adhesion (36.34&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2). Structural characterizations confirm its amorphous and homogeneously mixed nature, while micro&#8208;Raman and XPS/TOF&#8208;SIMS analyses reveal uniform component distribution and the formation of an organic&#8211;inorganic gradient SEI layer on lithium. These features enable exceptional electrochemical performance in both symmetric and full batteries, including over 2000 h of stable cycling and &gt;800 cycles at 0.5&#160;C in LFP|PMEC|Li batteries with &gt;88% capacity retention. Moreover, PMEC&#8208;based pouch batteries maintain functionality under severe mechanical abuse. This tire&#8208;inspired electrolyte&#160;design offers a generalizable platform for high&#8208;safety and high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.

         <title>Activating Co2+/Co3+ Redox Couple Mediated&#8208;Electrooxidation of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethyl Furfuryl Under Low Potentials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen vacancies facilitate the adsorption of OH&#8722; on F&#8208;VO&#8208;CoMoO4, while the highly electronegative lattice F atoms enhance the oxidability of Co3+&#8208;OHads. This synergy enables F&#8208;VO&#8208;CoMoO4 to catalyze the low&#8208;potential eHMFOR mediated by the Co2+/Co3+ redox couple.








Abstract
Cobalt&#8208;based electrocatalysts are promising candidates for electrochemical 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (eHMFOR). However, the activity origin for eHMFOR on most cobalt&#8208;based electrocatalysts is the Co3+/Co4+ redox couple at the high&#8208;potential window, instead of the Co2+/Co3+ redox couple at the low&#8208;potential window, thus leading to a high onset potential above 1.3&#160;V. Herein, we developed F&#8208;VO&#8208;CoMoO4 catalyst containing abound oxygen vacancies and lattice fluorine (F) heteroatom, which activates the Co2+/Co3+ redox couple for eHMFOR at the low&#8208;potential window, e.g., 1.15&#160;V. Oxygen vacancies prompt the electrochemical generation of Co3+&#8208;OHads at low potentials, and meanwhile, lattice F heteroatoms enhance the electrophilicity of Co3+&#8208;OHads. Benefiting by those unique structure, F&#8208;VO&#8208;CoMoO4 catalyst effectively electro&#8208;synthesizes 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid from 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural, with a high yield (95.3%) and Faradaic efficiency (96.1%). This work provides an intelligent strategy for achieving the low&#8208;potential eHMFOR mediated by the Co2+/Co3+ redox couple, unlocking significant potential for reducing the energy consumption in biomass conversion.

         <title>Structural Dependence of Catenand Effect: Thermodynamic and Kinetic Modulation of Catenane Coordination Properties via Ring&#8208;size and Exocyclic Substituent Variation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By modifying ring size and exocyclic substituents, effects of ligand interlocking on metal coordination features is explored. Through systematic analysis of CuI catenanes, relationship between structural parameters of the interlocked ligands and coordination properties like geometry, stability, and reactivity is established. Insights from this study enable the design of switchable catalysts and establish principles for leveraging mechanical interlocking in coordination chemistry.








Abstract
Although the effects of ligand interlocking on specific features of coordinated metal were first reported in 1980s&#8217;, strategies to precisely control these features through structural modifications of interlocked ligands remains underdeveloped. This limitation has hindered the broader exploitation of this unique class of coordination compounds across various fields of transition metal chemistry. Through a systematic comparison and detail analysis of a series of CuI catenane complexes, we show in this work that the size of the interlocked rings and exocyclic substituents are important structural parameters that regulate the exposure of the metal coordination sphere, which also influences the coordination geometry, electronic structures, spectroscopic, photophysical and electrochemical properties, as well as thermodynamic stability, ligand exchange kinetics, and chemical reactivity of the coordinated metal. Relationship between the structural features of the catenane and the extent of these effects is also revealed. These insights not only faciliate the rational design of a new type of switchable catenane catalyst wherein the interlocked structure is preserved, but also establish new principles for leveraging the unique effects of mechanical interlocking for diverse applications involving coordination complexes.

     alt="Structural Dependence of Catenand Effect: Thermodynamic and Kinetic Modulation of Catenane Coordination Properties via Ring-size and Exocyclic Substituent Variation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By modifying ring size and exocyclic substituents, effects of ligand interlocking on metal coordination features is explored. Through systematic analysis of Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; catenanes, relationship between structural parameters of the interlocked ligands and coordination properties like geometry, stability, and reactivity is established. Insights from this study enable the design of switchable catalysts and establish principles for leveraging mechanical interlocking in coordination chemistry.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the effects of ligand interlocking on specific features of coordinated metal were first reported in 1980s&#8217;, strategies to precisely control these features through structural modifications of interlocked ligands remains underdeveloped. This limitation has hindered the broader exploitation of this unique class of coordination compounds across various fields of transition metal chemistry. Through a systematic comparison and detail analysis of a series of Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; catenane complexes, we show in this work that the size of the interlocked rings and exocyclic substituents are important structural parameters that regulate the exposure of the metal coordination sphere, which also influences the coordination geometry, electronic structures, spectroscopic, photophysical and electrochemical properties, as well as thermodynamic stability, ligand exchange kinetics, and chemical reactivity of the coordinated metal. Relationship between the structural features of the catenane and the extent of these effects is also revealed. These insights not only faciliate the rational design of a new type of switchable catenane catalyst wherein the interlocked structure is preserved, but also establish new principles for leveraging the unique effects of mechanical interlocking for diverse applications involving coordination complexes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Clerodin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first and asymmetric total synthesis of clerodin is reported. Key transformations included titanium(III) catalyzed cyclization of an epoxide ene&#8208;yne compound containing an internal oxygenated methyl&#8208;bearing alkene, metallaphotoredox&#8208;enabled deoxygenative coupling of an alcohol, and SmI2&#8208;mediated elimination of a pre&#8208;installed acetal to establish the 2,3&#8208;dihydrofuran motif. 








Abstract
The first and asymmetric total synthesis of clerodin, the earliest isolated clerodane diterpenoid, has been achieved by tail&#8208;to&#8208;head cyclization and modular synthetic strategies. The C19 oxidized trans&#8208;decalin core was constructed via a tail&#8208;to&#8208;head cyclization of an epoxide ene&#8208;yne compound containing an internal oxygenated methyl&#8208;bearing alkene. This process involved a titanium(III) catalyzed epoxide ring&#8208;opening/ene&#8208;yne cyclization. The furan fragment was assembled through a metallaphotoredox&#8208;enabled deoxygenative coupling of an alcohol precursor. A SmI2&#8208;mediated elimination of a pre&#8208;installed acetal established the 2,3&#8208;dihydrofuran motif.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Tolerant and Scalable Diffusio&#8211;Osmotic Power Generation with Sulfonated Covalent Organic Framework Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate the harvesting of salinity gradient energy via diffusio&#8211;osmosis. This approach eliminates the need of selectivity and thus overcomes the permeability&#8211;selectivity trade&#8208;off and concentration polarization, showing high power density and scalability. Notably, our material maintains power generation even with substantial pinholes, simplifying membrane fabrication than before.








Abstract
Salinity gradient energy extracted with the reverse electrodialysis technique is attracting great interest and has been suggested as a promising renewable and stable energy source. However, the reverse electrodialysis relies on highly charge&#8208;selective membranes, causing a range of problems including the selectivity&#8211;permeability trade&#8208;off, strong concentration polarization, and strict requirement on the material structure, severely limiting its viability for large scale applications. We demonstrate these problems may be addressed by adopting the diffusio&#8211;osmosis process to generate power using sulfonated covalent framework membranes (COF), which does not require any charge selectivity. As a result, the membrane shows much higher power density compared to similar&#8208;sized membranes and enables much higher scalability. Remarkably, the generator has loose requirement on material structure and could largely maintain its power generation performance even when a substantial number of pinholes are present. This could make the material fabrication significantly easier than before. We expect our work to advance the practical application of salinity gradient energy extraction.

A rollercoaster illustrates the competing pathways of para&#8208;substituted arylazo&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;trimethylpyrazole photoswitches during thermal Z/E isomerization. In their Research Article (e202514433), the groups of Leticia Gonz&#225;lez and Marko Mihovilovic show how the substituent directs the track: electron&#8208;donating groups favour a nonadiabatic rotational track via the lowest triplet state, while electron&#8208;withdrawing groups follow a conventional ground&#8208;state inversion track.

         <dc:description>
Which conformation will fall to the bottom of the potential well? Quantum chemistry calculations usually give a correct and unanimous answer, but a simple molecular photoswitch has pushed different levels of theory into a tug of war. In their Research Article (e202513560), R. J. C. Roque, S. R. Domingos and co&#8208;workers employ rotational spectroscopy to settle this dispute. As the cover picture suggests, their study extends into the microsolvated world to prompt whether a wet photoswitch is less&#160;controversial.

         <title>Influence of the Acid Reactivity of Carbenium Ions in Zeolites on the Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Olefins Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we studied the Br&#248;nsted acid reactivity of polymethylbenzenium and alkyl&#8208;substituted cyclopentenyl cations, key intermediates in the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefins process in ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite. CD3CN selectively and reversibly deprotonates benzenium ions, while cyclopentenyl cations require stronger bases. These results reveal a reactivity scale and provide insight into carbocation chemistry in reactive environments.








Abstract
Carbocations are typical intermediates in acid catalyzed reactions in organic chemistry synthesis. Confinement within the framework of zeotype materials distinguishes the function of carbenium ions as catalytic centers in various chemical processes. A selective and reversible deprotonation event of benzenium ions built in H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 during methanol conversion was observed by experiment and theory as a result of CD3CN dosage, denoting their higher acid reactivity compared to the cyclopentenyl cations, which undergo deprotonation only in presence of pyridine. This study uncovers the inverse relationship between the acid reactivity of carbenium ions of different nature and their stability in the surface&#8208;bound state.

         <dc:description>
The presented work demonstrates a cocrystallization&#8208;enabled mechanochemical interconversion of geometrical isomers of a coordination complex, illustrating the use of halogen&#8208;bond&#8208;driven cocrystal formation for generating new metal&#8208;based responsive behaviours.








Abstract
Halogen bonding enables the mechanochemical ball&#8208;milling isomerization of an otherwise persistent cis&#8208;coordinated metal complex into the corresponding trans&#8208;isomer. The importance of halogen bonding for enabling the cis&#8594;trans isomerization of the metal centre is evidenced by real&#8208;time in situ synchrotron powder X&#8208;ray diffraction monitoring of the ball&#8208;milling experiments that showed the transient appearance of a cis&#8208;geometry metal&#8208;organic halogen&#8208;bonded (MOXB) cocrystal, which is rapidly replaced by the corresponding trans&#8208;geometry one, with any excess, non&#8208;halogen&#8208;bonded cis&#8208;geometry complex being retained throughout the milling experiment. The importance of cocrystallization for cis&#8594;trans isomerization is supported by periodic density&#8208;functional theory calculations which show that the process becomes notably more enthalpically favourable in the presence of the halogen bond donor. The presented work indicates that the formation of MOXB cocrystals can open the door to new, metal&#8208;based responsive behaviours, different from those of parent solid&#8208;state coordination complexes.

&lt;p&gt;The presented work demonstrates a cocrystallization-enabled mechanochemical interconversion of geometrical isomers of a coordination complex, illustrating the use of halogen-bond-driven cocrystal formation for generating new metal-based responsive behaviours.

         <title>Tuning Solvation Structure Via Inductive and Steric Hindrance Effects for High&#8208;Voltage LiCoO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inductive and steric hindrance from a highly fluorinated ether diluent weaken Li+&#8211;solvent coordination and enrich anion participation, yielding compact solvation shells resulting into the formation of a robust bilayer interphase, thus enabling&#160;&gt;6.5&#160;V stability and long&#8208;term cycling of 4.6&#160;V LiCoO2 batteries.








Abstract
High&#8208;voltage lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) has a high specific capacity and energy density, making it a promising cathode material for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, stabilizing LiCoO2 at elevated charging cut&#8208;off voltages remains challenging due to the severe interfacial degradation, particularly the instability of the cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase (CEI) under oxidative conditions. Herein, we propose a novel push&#8211;pull electrolyte design strategy by incorporating a non&#8208;coordinating diluent, 1H,1H,5H&#8208;perfluoropentyl&#8208;1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethylether (HFE), which modulates the Li+ solvation structure through strong inductive and steric hindrance effects, thereby enabling the formation of a robust CEI on the LiCoO2 surface. Guided by molecular electrostatic potential analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance characterizations, the optimized electrolyte creates a tailored solvation environment that suppresses parasitic interfacial reactions and facilitates the formation of a bilayer interphase. As a result, the LiCoO2 cathode exhibits excellent electrochemical stability with the HFE&#8208;containing electrolyte, delivering over 300 stable cycles at 4.6&#160;V in high&#8208;loading LiCoO2//Li cells (&#8764;11&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) and retaining 77% capacity after 200 cycles in LiCoO2//Graphite full&#8208;cells at 4.5&#160;V. This solvation engineering strategy provides a promising pathway toward next&#8208;generation high&#8208;voltage LiCoO2&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>Formation of Monolithic Magnesium&#8211;Calcium Carbonates Through Aggregation of Carbonate&#8208;Cluster Nanodroplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Schematic illustrating the formation of monolithic amorphous magnesium&#8211;calcium carbonate through the aggregation of nanodroplets. The color coding indicates that the Mg content may differ between the surface and the core. The two solid&#8208;state packings of Mg&#8208;rich and Mg&#8208;deficient domains shown on the right are structurally equivalent. Each tiny cube represents an amorphous domain with distinct Mg content. The cubes serve as a convenient visual guide to the space&#8208;filling feature of the amorphous domains.








Abstract
Mineral nucleation is a fundamental process of paramount importance to various fields, including geology, biomineralization, and industrial manufacturing. Recently, studies on the biominerals of calcium carbonate and phosphate have revealed the presence of a dense liquid phase prior to the formation of an amorphous solid phase. Here, we show that liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation occurs in a non&#8208;aqueous solution where magnesium and calcium carbonates are dissolved in ethanol with excess triethylamine. The nanodroplets can be kinetically trapped by triethylamine. We found that molecular complexes of triethylamine, CO2, and ethanol molecules are in constant exchange with sizable carbonate clusters. We argue that nanodroplets comprising highly solvated carbonate clusters are the key entities in the nucleation process. Remarkably, the coalescence of the nanodroplets leads to the formation of a monolithic magnesium&#8208;calcium carbonate containing two distinct domains with different Mg content.

         <title>Crafting Immune&#8208;Cancer Cell Crosstalk via Modular Multilayer Logic DNA Nanoadaptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a modular DNA nanoadaptor (Magic&#8208;NA) featuring multi&#8208;port scaffold and plug&#8208;and&#8208;play connectors that programs immune&#8208;cancer cell interactions via customizable multilayer logic gates responding to cellular antigens and microenvironmental cues, enabling on&#8208;demand cell targeting and broad&#8208;spectrum cell killing.








Abstract
Synthetic molecular recognition tools offer a promising approach to reconfigure cell&#8208;cell interactions, but engineering user&#8208;defined logic circuits to control intercellular communication in heterogeneous microenvironments endures as a critical barrier. Herein, we present a multilayer logic DNA nanoadaptor (Magic&#8208;NA) to define immune&#8208;cancer cell crosstalk by a customized logic operation of multiple variables, including cell surface antigens and microenvironmental characteristics. The modular Magic&#8208;NA consists of a DNA di&#8208;tetrahedral scaffold featuring three ports at each terminal. These ports can be interfaced with a library of plug&#8208;and&#8208;play logic connectors specifically activated by molecular triggers and targeted to desired cells, enabling programmable design of both logic circuits and inputs. We demonstrated an AND&#8208;AND logic network in Magic&#8208;NA that guides natural killer (NK) cells to target cells for selective cytotoxicity, based on tumor microenvironment (TME) acidic pH, and cellular antigens PTK7 and MUC1. Furthermore, leveraging the multi&#8208;port design, we implemented an OR&#8208;AND logic gate system to achieve on&#8208;demand cell targeting and broad&#8208;spectrum cell killing. This nanoplatform provides a paradigm for manipulating cellular interactions through Boolean integration of cell&#8208;intrinsic markers and microenvironmental cues, advancing the development of precision cancer immunotherapy.
