         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Assemblies of Polyoxovanadate Clusters as Supramolecular Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient strategy for embedding catalytically active polyoxovanadate (POV) into supramolecular assemblies was developed by utilizing host&#8208;guest interactions between pillararenes grafted on the cluster and ditopic linkers. The amphiphilic nature of the POV in the host&#8208;guest complex promoted responsive behavior of the assembly toward the solvent polarity. Lastly, the assembly showed enhanced catalytic properties compared to the parent POV.







Abstract
Supramolecular functional materials can be used to overcome some of the most challenging tasks in materials science, where the dynamic nature of supramolecular interactions can be leveraged to fine&#8208;tune the properties of the material for a given task. The Lindqvist hexavanadate family of polyoxometalates (POMs) have emerged as particularly interesting candidates to be used in supramolecular materials due to their redox and Lewis acid properties that enable their application in the fields of energy conversion/storage or catalysis. Despite their promising potential, hexavanadate clusters are underrepresented in the field of supramolecular materials, mainly due to the synthetic challenges related to their inherent reactivity. In this work, pillar[5]arene was successfully grafted onto a Lindqvist hexavanadate and the resulting structure was confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD), presenting the first example of a crystal structure of a POMcovalently functionalized with a pillar[5]arene. By introducing a ditopic guest molecule that could interlink pillar[5]arene moieties, host&#8211;guest interactions were leveraged as the driving force for the formation of supramolecular assemblies incorporating hexavanadate clusters in a controlled manner. The enhanced catalytic performance of the resulting aggregates confirmed their potential application as functional catalytic materials. This novel approach for developing hexavanadate&#8208;based catalysts reported here showcases the potential of using host&#8211;guest interactions as a means to introduce catalytically active metal&#8208;oxo clusters into supramolecular frameworks.

         <title>A Microporous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework with Open Pyrene Sites Isolated by Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Helical Chains for Efficient Separation of Xenon and Krypton</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first microporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) incorporating hydrogen&#8208;bonded helical chains, which are functionalized by open pyrene sites, thereby exhibits exceptional Xe/Kr separation performance surpassing all previously reported HOF materials under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Achieving efficient xenon/krypton (Xe/Kr) separation in emerging hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) is highly challenging because of the lack of gas&#8208;binding sites on their pore surfaces. Herein, we report the first microporous HOF (HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;168) based on hydrogen&#8208;bonded helical chains, which prevent self&#8208;aggregation of the pyrene core, thereby preserving open pyrene sites on the pore surfaces. Its activated form, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;168a is capable of separating Xe/Kr under ambient conditions while achieving an excellent balance between adsorption capacity and selectivity. At 296&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar, the Xe adsorption capacity of HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;168a reached 78.31&#8197;cm3/g, with an Xe/Kr IAST selectivity of 22.0; both values surpass those of currently known top&#8208;performing HOFs. Breakthrough experiments confirmed its superior separation performance with a separation factor of 8.6 and a yield of high&#8208;purity Kr (&gt;99.5&#8201;%) of 184&#8197;mL/g. Furthermore HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;168 exhibits excellent thermal and chemical stability, as well as renewability. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and molecular modeling revealed that the unique electrostatic surface potential around the open pyrene sites creates a micro&#8208;electric field, exerting a stronger polarizing effect on Xe than on Kr, thereby enhancing host&#8208;Xe interactions.

         <title>Transitioning Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Solid States to Aqueous Phases via a Cyclic Peptide&#8208;Based Supramolecular Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universally applicable supramolecular strategy to transition room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from solid states to aqueous phases is reported. By utilizing a cyclic peptide&#8208;based supramolecular scaffold, a series of aqueous RTP materials are constructed through the noncovalent dispersion of diverse organic phosphors within its rigid hydrophobic microdomain.







Abstract
Aqueous room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have garnered considerable attention for their significant potential across various applications such as bioimaging, sensing, and encryption. However, establishing a universally applicable method for achieving aqueous RTP remains a substantial challenge. Herein, we present a versatile supramolecular strategy to transition RTP from solid states to aqueous phases. By leveraging a cyclic peptide&#8208;based supramolecular scaffold, we have developed a noncovalent approach to molecularly disperse diverse organic phosphors within its rigid hydrophobic microdomain in water, yielding a series of aqueous RTP materials. Moreover, high&#8208;performance supramolecular phosphorescence resonance energy transfer (PRET) systems have been constructed. Through the facile co&#8208;assembly of a fluorescent acceptor with the existing RTP system, these PRET systems exhibit high energy transfer efficiencies (&gt;80&#8201;%), red&#8208;shifted afterglow emission (520&#8211;790&#8197;nm), ultralarge Stokes shifts (up to 450&#8197;nm), and improved photoluminescence quantum yields (6.1&#8211;30.7&#8201;%). This study not only provides a general strategy for constructing aqueous RTP materials from existing phosphors, but also facilitates the creation of PRET systems featuring color&#8208;tunable afterglow emission.

         <title>A Detailed View on the (Re)isomerization Dynamics in Microbial Rhodopsins Using Complementary Near&#8208;UV and IR Readouts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The near&#8208;UV readout (SBS) in microbial rhodopsins can be used to probe the retinal configuration as well as electrostatic changes associated with the charge translocation during the ion pumping process in real time.







Abstract
Isomerization is a key process in many (bio)chemical systems. In microbial rhodopsins, the photoinduced isomerization of the all&#8208;trans retinal to the 13&#8208;cis isomer initiates a cascade of structural changes of the protein. The interplay between these changes and the thermal relaxation of the isomerized retinal is one of the crucial determinants for rhodopsin functionality. It is therefore important to probe this dynamic interplay with chromophore specific markers that combine gapless temporal observation with spectral sensitivity. Here we utilize the near&#8208;UV and mid&#8208;IR fingerprint region in the framework of a systematic (time&#8208;resolved) spectroscopic study on H+&#8208; (HsBR, (G)PR), Na+&#8208; (KR2, ErNaR) and Cl&#8722;&#8208;(NmHR) pumps. We demonstrate that the near&#8208;UV region is an excellent probe for retinal configuration and&#8212;being sensitive to the electrostatic environment of retinal&#8212;even transient ion binding, which allows us to pinpoint protein specific mechanistic nuances and chromophore&#8208;charge interactions. The combination of the near&#8208;UV and mid&#8208;IR fingerprint region hence provides a spectroscopic analysis tool that allows a detailed, precise and temporally fully resolved description of retinal configurations during all stages of the photocycle.

         <title>Cognitive Diversity for Creativity and Inclusive Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cognitive diversity explores aspects beyond traditional lenses of culture, physical diversity, and merit and into variations in problem solving skills. Understanding aspects that need to be recognized in recruitment for various scientific enterprises will promote higher productivity, efficiency, diversity and heterogeneity in a team.







Abstract
Cognitively diverse teams outperform high intelligence (IQ) teams in problem solving, while businesses with at least one woman in their board of directors financially outperform ones with all men boards. These well&#8208;known facts are lost in most academic science enterprises. Herein, we make the case for looking at sources, approaches, and opportunities in expanding cognitive diversity of research teams for high productivity and efficiency.

     alt="Cognitive Diversity for Creativity and Inclusive Growth"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive diversity explores aspects beyond traditional lenses of culture, physical diversity, and merit and into variations in problem solving skills. Understanding aspects that need to be recognized in recruitment for various scientific enterprises will promote higher productivity, efficiency, diversity and heterogeneity in a team.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitively diverse teams outperform high intelligence (IQ) teams in problem solving, while businesses with at least one woman in their board of directors financially outperform ones with all men boards. These well-known facts are lost in most academic science enterprises. Herein, we make the case for looking at sources, approaches, and opportunities in expanding cognitive diversity of research teams for high productivity and efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulated Charge Transfer in Donor&#8208;Acceptor Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Highly&#8208;Sensitive Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer approach is used to grow naphthalenediimide&#8208;based donor&#8208;acceptor MOF thin films for efficient free charge generation in response to light. Interestingly, we find that the optimum photocurrent response is obtained at a low optimal doping concentration of acceptor, which outperforms traditional donor&#8208;MOF thin films by a factor of forty.







Abstract
In photo&#8208;induced charge separation, organic thin films with donor and acceptor chromophores are vital for uses such as artificial photosynthesis and photodetection. The main challenges include optimizing charge separation efficiency and identifying the ideal acceptor/donor ratio. Achieving this is difficult due to the variability in molecular configurations within these typically amorphous organic aggregates. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) provide a structured solution by enabling systematic design of donor/acceptor blends with adjustable ratios within a crystalline lattice. We demonstrate this approach by incorporating donor and acceptor naphthalenediimide (NDI) chromophores as linkers in a highly oriented, monolithic MOF thin film. By adjusting the NDI acceptor linker concentration during the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of surface&#8208;anchored MOF thin films (SURMOFs), we significantly enhanced charge separation efficiency. Surprisingly, the optimum acceptor concentration was only 3&#8201;%, achieving a forty&#8208;fold increase in photodetection efficiency compared to baseline NDI donor&#8208;based SURMOFs. This unexpected behaviour was clarified through theoretical analysis enabled by the well&#8208;defined crystalline structure of the SURMOFs. Using density functional theory and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we identified two opposing effects from acceptors: the positive effect of suppressing undesirable charge carrier recombination is offset at high concentrations by a reduction in charge&#8208;carrier mobility.

         <title>Coupling Rotary Motion to Helicene Inversion within a Molecular Motor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;powered molecular motor featuring a specifically engineered helicene moiety is presented. The inversion of the helicene fragment is mechanically coupled to the unidirectional rotation of the motor in a 6&#8208;step rotation cycle, which involves 8 isomers. This coupled motion results in the dynamic modulation of the handedness of the helicene by the motor via a central to helical to helical chiral transmission mechanism.







Abstract
Towards complex coupled molecular motions, the remote handedness inversion of a helicene moiety was achieved by a rotary molecular motor. The use of a specifically engineered dynamic helicene stator in a novel overcrowded&#8208;alkene second&#8208;generation molecular motor based on a fluorinated dibenzofluorene fragment allows for an unprecedented control over helicity inversion. This is achieved by the mechanical coupling of the rotation of the rotor to the helicene inversion of the stator half via a remote chirality transmission process. Thus, the unidirectional rotary motion generated upon irradiation is used to invert the dynamic stereochemistry of a helicene, leading to a 6&#8208;step cycle with eight intermediates. In this cycle, both alternation between P and M configurations of the helicene stator and dynamic thermal interconversion (paddling motion) can be achieved. In&#8208;depth computational and spectroscopic studies were performed to support the associated mechanism. The control over coupled motion and dynamic helicity offers prospects for the development of complex responsive systems.

         <title>Carbon Nanoparticle Oxidation by NO2 and O2: Chemical Kinetics and Reaction Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a kinetic multilayer model and comprehensive experimental data, this study investigates the oxidation of carbon nanoparticles by NO2 and O2 under combustion exhaust conditions, going beyond traditional shrinking core modelling approaches. The study develops a molecular picture of the reaction system, including a reference chemical reaction mechanisms and energy profiles for three alternative reaction pathways.







Abstract
Carbon nanoparticle interactions with gases are central to many environmental and technical processes, but the underlying reaction kinetics and mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we investigate the oxidation and gasification of carbon nanoparticles by NO2 and O2 under combustion exhaust conditions. We build on a comprehensive experimental data set and use a kinetic multilayer model (KM&#8208;GAP&#8208;CARBON) to trace the uptake and release of gas molecules alongside the temporal evolution of particle size and surface composition. The experimental results are captured by a model mechanism that involves different types of carbon atoms (edge/plane&#8208;like) and the formation of a reactive oxygen intermediate (activated CO complex) as the rate&#8208;limiting step. A transition between distinct chemical regimes driven by NO2 at lower temperatures and O2 at higher temperatures is reflected by an increase in the observable activation energy from

         <title>Anti&#8208;Stokes Emission Utilizing Reverse Intersystem Crossing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternative mechanism of photon&#8208;upconversion using a spin&#8208;flip process was proposed and demonstrated by combining a triplet sensitizer and a thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) molecule. The triplet energy transfer from the green phosphorescent emitter (Ir(ppy)3) to the blue TADF emitter (CzBSe) results in anti&#8208;Stokes emission with an anti&#8208;Stokes energy of 0.18&#8197;eV.







Abstract
Photon&#8208;upconversion (PUC) processes in organic molecular systems, such as triplet&#8208;triplet upconversion and hot&#8208;band absorption, are promising technologies for future energy harvesting. Although these processes can generate high&#8208;energy excitons compared to excitation energy, a PUC process with a high yield and no energy loss has not been established and, therefore, is highly desired. Here, we propose an alternative PUC mechanism that uses reverse intersystem crossing on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules. This process combines a triplet sensitizer and a TADF molecule, generating a triplet in the former and transferring it to the latter. Specifically, the triplet energy transfer from Ir(ppy)3 (sensitizer) to CzBSe (TADF) results in anti&#8208;Stokes emission with an anti&#8208;Stokes energy of 0.18&#8197;eV. We found that the triplet energy transfer rate strongly depends on the triplet radiative decay rate of TADF molecules and the difference in Gibbs energy between the energy acceptor and donor. Our findings will contribute to understanding triplet energy transfer dynamics in organic energy donor&#8208;acceptor systems and will lead to various applications, such as future optical cooling systems.

         <title>Exploiting High Order Magnetic Anisotropy for Advanced Magnetocaloric Refrigerants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;crystal experiments on the novel 3&#8201;d&#8211;4&#8201;f complex [DyDOTA][CrF2(py)4] (DOTA=tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;tetraacetate, py=pyridine) have revealed a tetragonal easy&#8208;plane magnetic anisotropy. Temperature and magnetic&#8208;field dependent experiments to evaluate the rotating magnetocaloric effect demonstrated the potential of high&#8208;order anisotropies for developing more efficient magnetocaloric materials.







Abstract
Three new 3&#8201;d&#8211;4&#8201;f complexes of general formula trans&#8208;[MF2(py)4][LnDOTA] (M=Cr3+ or Co3+, Ln=Dy3+ or Y3+, py=pyridine and DOTA=tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;tetraacetate) have been synthetised. The fluoride&#8208;bridged systems were designed to achieve perfect tetragonal symmetry by combining four&#8208;fold symmetric lanthanide and transition metal building blocks. From single crystal measurements, an unprecedented switch of the tetragonal anisotropy of the Dy3+ complexes has been observed. A combination of spectroscopic observations, magnetometry measurements and ab initio calculations allowed us to pinpoint the origin of this phenomenon, which is related to the peculiar energy level structure of the complexes. Moreover, the fourfold anisotropy of the complex has been exploited to design a rotating magnetocaloric experiment showing that tetragonal anisotropy holds great potential to engineer a new class of more efficient magnetic refrigerants.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three new &lt;b&gt;3&#8201;d&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;4&#8201;f&lt;/b&gt; complexes of general formula &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-[MF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(py)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;][LnDOTA] (M=Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; or Co&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ln=Dy&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; or Y&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, py=pyridine and DOTA=tetraazacyclododecane-N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;-tetraacetate) have been synthetised. The fluoride-bridged systems were designed to achieve perfect tetragonal symmetry by combining four-fold symmetric lanthanide and transition metal building blocks. From single crystal measurements, an unprecedented switch of the tetragonal anisotropy of the Dy&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; complexes has been observed. A combination of spectroscopic observations, magnetometry measurements and &lt;i&gt;ab initio&lt;/i&gt; calculations allowed us to pinpoint the origin of this phenomenon, which is related to the peculiar energy level structure of the complexes. Moreover, the fourfold anisotropy of the complex has been exploited to design a rotating magnetocaloric experiment showing that tetragonal anisotropy holds great potential to engineer a new class of more efficient magnetic refrigerants.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reassessing the Photochemical Upcycling of Polystyrene Using Acridinium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It&#8242;s all about oxygen! Photochemical upcycling of polystyrene occurs efficiently using an acridinium photocatalyst even under solar irradiation. However, contrary to expectations, the mechanism proceeds through the generation of reactive oxygen species.







Abstract
Polystyrene (PS) is a commodity plastic recalcitrant to chemical recycling or upcycling processes. Approaches aimed at deconstructing PS by photocatalytic means struggle to generate high&#8208;energy species capable of cleaving the robust C&#8722;H and C&#8722;C bonds of PS. We show that 9&#8208;mesityl&#8208;10&#8208;methylacridinium perchlorate (MA) is capable of upcycling various grades of PS substrates into up to 40&#8201;% benzoic acid (BAc), formic acid (FA) and small proportions of acetophenone (ACP), under visible light (456&#8197;nm) or through solar radiation. Time&#8208;resolved emission and absorption spectroscopy evidence that a reaction with oxygen is the primary photochemical step in oxygen&#8208;saturated solutions, accounting for 77&#8201;% of the photons absorbed vs. 1&#8201;% for the direct reaction with PS (0.303&#8197;M in repeating units). These results are in agreement with a mechanism in which MA&#8208;mediated photo upcycling of PS to BAc occurs through the abstraction of benzylic H atoms by reactive oxygen species generated by energy or electron transfer from the excited state of MA. Addition of triplet O2 to these radicals, followed by intra&#8208; or inter&#8208;molecular hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) generates C&#8208; or O&#8208;centered radicals then undergoing &#946;&#8208;scission or hydroperoxide fragmentation. The formation of intermediate oligomers functionalized by terminal carbonyl groups is demonstrated by both infrared analysis and MALDI TOF mass spectrometry. These oligomers undergo further photoinduced conversion even in the absence of MA, as evidenced by size exclusion chromatography analysis of the irradiated samples.

         <title>Stable Mono&#8208;Radical and Triplet Diradicals Based on Allylic Radical&#8208;Embedded All&#8208;Benzenoid Polycyclic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The derivative of an allylic radical&#8208;embedded all&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic hydrocarbon (dibenzo[fg,lm]heptacene) was synthesized, which showed high stability due to captodative effect and desired high&#8208;spin triplet ground state with a large singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap.







Abstract
High&#8208;spin organic radicals are notable for their unique optical, electronic, and magnetic properties, but synthesizing stable high&#8208;spin systems is challenging due to their inherent reactivity. This study presents a novel strategy for designing stable high&#8208;spin polycyclic hydrocarbons (PHs) by incorporating allylic radical into fused aromatic benzenoid rings. To enhance stability, large steric hindrance groups with a synergistic captodative effect were added to the allylic radical centers. This approach was applied to synthesize derivatives of two open&#8208;shell all&#8208;benzenoid PHs: benzo[fg]tetracene (1) and dibenzo[fg,lm]heptacene (2). Both compounds exhibited excellent stability, with diradical 2 showing a half&#8208;life of up to 17.2&#8197;days under ambient conditions. Bond length analysis and theoretical calculations suggest that 1 and 2 predominantly feature Clar's aromatic sextet structures with embedded allylic radicals. Compound 2 was confirmed to have a triplet ground state through DFT calculations and experimental methods, including pulse EPR spectroscopy and SQUID measurements. This work introduces a new design strategy for stable high&#8208;spin hydrocarbons, paving the way for future developments in high&#8208;spin organic materials.

         <title>Inverse Vulcanization of Aziridines: Enhancing Polysulfides for Superior Mechanical Strength and Adhesive Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triaziridine crosslinker, SaC&#8208;100, is used in inverse vulcanization to create polysulfides with superior mechanical strength. These polymers exhibit exceptional adhesion to various substrates and maintain their performance at extremely low temperatures.







Abstract
This study introduces a novel approach to inverse vulcanization by utilizing a commercially available triaziridine crosslinker as an alternative to conventional olefin&#8208;based crosslinkers. The model reactions reveal a self&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening of &#8220;unactivated&#8221; aziridine with elemental sulfur, forming oligosulfide&#8208;functionalized diamines. The triaziridine&#8208;derived polysulfides exhibit impressive mechanical properties, achieving a maximum stress of ~8.3&#8197;MPa and an elongation at break of ~107&#8201;%. The incorporation of silicon dioxide (20&#8197;wt&#8201;%) enhances the composite's rigidity, yielding a Young's modulus of ~0.94&#8197;GPa. Furthermore, these polysulfides display excellent adhesion strength on various substrates, such as aluminum (~7.0&#8197;MPa), walnut (~9.6&#8197;MPa), and steel (~11.0&#8197;MPa), with substantial retention of adhesion strength (~3.3&#8197;MPa on steel) at &#8722;196&#8201;&#176;C. The straightforward synthetic process, combined with the accessibility of the triaziridine crosslinker, emphasizes the potential for further innovations in sulfur polymer chemistry.

         <title>Selective Nonenzymatic Formation of Biologically Common RNA Hairpins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Template&#8208;free RNA loop&#8208;closing ligation selectively generates RNA tetraloops that are prevalent in biology, as demonstrated by high&#8208;throughput sequencing. Utilizing high&#8208;yield overhang sequences enables the efficient assembly of functional RNAs.







Abstract
The prebiotic formation of RNA building blocks is well&#8208;supported experimentally, yet the emergence of sequence&#8208; and structure&#8208;specific RNA oligomers is generally attributed to biological selection via Darwinian evolution rather than prebiotic chemical selectivity. In this study, we used deep sequencing to investigate the partitioning of randomized RNA overhangs into ligated products by either splinted ligation or loop&#8208;closing ligation. Comprehensive sequence&#8208;reactivity profiles revealed that loop&#8208;closing ligation preferentially yields hairpin structures with loop sequences UNNG, CNNG, and GNNA (where N represents A, C, G, or U) under competing conditions. In contrast, splinted ligation products tended to be GC rich. Notably, the overhang sequences that preferentially partition to loop&#8208;closing ligation significantly overlap with the most common biological tetraloops, whereas the overhangs favoring splinted ligation exhibit an inverse correlation with biological tetraloops. Applying these sequence rules enables the high&#8208;efficiency assembly of functional ribozymes from short RNAs without template inhibition. Our findings suggest that the RNA tetraloop structures that are common in biology may have been predisposed and prevalent in the prebiotic pool of RNAs, prior to the advent of Darwinian evolution. We suggest that the one&#8208;step prebiotic chemical process of loop&#8208;closing ligation could have favored the emergence of the first RNA functions.

The discovery of a new reactivity mode for &#960;&#8208;arene metal complexes to promote carbon group insertion is reported. The reaction uses ruthenium &#951;6&#8208;arene complexes supported by a tripodal ligand with enolates derived from &#945;&#8208;halo&#8208; or &#945;&#8208;(tosyloxy)esters to transform &#960;&#8208;coordinated arenes to ring&#8208;expanded cycloheptatrienes in a single&#8208;step dearomatization process.







Abstract
Transition metal &#960;&#8208;arene complexes enable the dearomatization of benzene rings to access diversified unsaturated carbocycles through multistep synthetic procedures involving sequential addition of nucleophiles and electrophiles. This work details a single&#8208;step dearomatization process by reaction of Ru(&#951;6&#8208;arene) complexes with enolates derived from &#945;&#8208;halo or &#945;&#8208;(tosyloxy)esters to directly transform &#960;&#8208;coordinated arenes to ring&#8208;expanded cycloheptatrienes.

         <title>Coordination Induced Spin State Transition Switches the Reactivity of Nickel (II) Porphyrin in Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study explores the impact of coordination&#8208;induced spin&#8208;state switching on hydrogen evolution reaction activity of nickel(II) porphyrin, revealing that low&#8208;spin Ni(II) porphyrin favors hydrogen evolution while high&#8208;spin counterpart facilitates &#946;&#8208;hydrogenation of porphyrin periphery. Our finding highlights the pivotal role of spin transition in regulating the reactivity and selectivity of metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions.







Abstract
Electron spin plays a critical role in chemical processes, particularly in reactions involving metal complexes with unpaired electrons. However, more definitive state&#8208;to&#8208;state experiments are needed to better elucidate the role of electronic spin. Herein, we chose nickel (II) 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) porphyrin 1 as a catalyst, which allows switching from a low spin to a high spin state of Ni (II) center through an axial pyridine coordination, for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). When pyridine is present, we observed &#946;&#8208;hydrogenation of porphyrin through electron transfer followed by proton transfer. In contrast, hydrogen evolution mainly occurs via the concerted proton&#8208;coupling electron transfer without pyridine coordination. Similar distinct spin&#8208;dependent selectivity was also observed in chemical reduction of 1 by CoCp2 with subsequent addition of pyridinium p&#8208;toluenesulfonate. Computational calculations using density functional theory demonstrated that the transition from low spin to high spin state enriches the ligand's electron density after one&#8208;electron reduction, leading to preferential protonation of &#946;&#8208;periphery rather than meso&#8208;position or metal center.

         <title>Total Synthesis and Configuration Assignment of (+)&#8208;Myxoquaterine&#8208;450</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise, modular synthesis of the structurally novel natural product myxoquaterine&#8208;450 (1) has been accomplished. Four building blocks were assembled by cross&#8208;coupling reactions to establish the all&#8208;(E)&#8208;configured hexaene core. The C25,C26&#8208;diastereoisomer of 1 was prepared to clarify the absolute configuration of the yet unassigned stereogenic centers.







Abstract
Myxoquaterines represent a recently discovered class of natural products with intriguing biological properties. They were isolated from Pendulasporacea albinea MSr 11954 and display a unique structure combining heterocyclic (pyrrole, oxazoline), hexaene, and 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,3&#8208;diol subunits. We have now synthesized the first example of a myxoquaterine natural product, myxoquaterine&#8208;450, in a highly convergent fashion, in which the sensitive hexaene unit was established in the final stages of the synthesis (16 linear steps starting from l&#8208;serine). Comparison of the synthetic material with an authentic sample allowed to establish and confirm the constitution and configuration of the natural product.

         <title>Combination of Ambient and High&#8208;Temperature Beryllium Nitride Motifs in W2Be4N5 and W4Be8N9</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two first transition metal nitridoberyllates W2Be4N5 and W4Be8N9 were synthesized in a high&#8208;temperature high&#8208;pressure approach starting from Be3N2, W and NH4N3 or NaN3, respectively. The layered crystal structures, which unite ambient and high&#8208;temperature motifs of beryllium nitride, was elucidated in a combined approach of several analytic techniques. The structure elucidation from X&#8208;ray diffraction data alone was not unambiguous.







Abstract
Compounds of transition metals and beryllium have a wide range of applications, from everyday tools to high tech applications. Remarkably, no single ternary beryllium nitride with a transition metal is known. Here, we report on the synthesis and properties of the first transition metal nitridoberyllates, namely W2Be4N5 and W4Be8N9. Both compounds were synthesized in a high&#8208;temperature high&#8208;pressure approach from Be3N2 and W, using azide generated N2 as an oxidizing agent. The crystal structures, consisting of alternating layers of WN6 trigonal prisms and BeN4 tetrahedra, were elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (sc&#8208;XRD). The separating nitridoberyllate layers show either ambient temperature (&#945;&#8208;Be3N2 type) or high temperature (&#946;&#8208;Be3N2 type) motifs. W2Be4N5 was further corroborated by infrared (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and UV/Vis spectroscopy and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) measurements. The latter revealed a mixed valence with an intermediate oxidation state of 3.5 for the W atoms. Both, the synthesis of the first transition metal nitridoberyllates and the synthesis approach using elemental W pave the way to a new field of nitride chemistry.

         <title>Adamantane&#8208;Type Nitridophosphate Phosphors AExLi10&#8722;2xP4N10&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ via Medium&#8208;Pressure Ion&#8208;Exchange Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile method for the synthesis of nitridophosphate&#8208;based phosphors using hot isostatic pressing is presented. Ion exchange reactions starting from the Li&#8208;ion conductor Li10P4N10 enables the preparation of single crystals and bulk samples of compounds with the general formula AExLi10&#8722;2xP4N10. Upon doping with Eu2+, these compounds exhibit remarkable luminescent properties across the green to red spectral range.







Abstract
Nitridophosphates have emerged as promising host compounds in the field of solid&#8208;state lighting. Their industrial relevance has increased significantly, mainly due to recent advances in synthetic approaches under medium&#8208;pressure (MP) conditions, including ammonothermal synthesis and hot isostatic pressing (HIP). In this study, we report on the synthesis and characterization of the quaternary representatives CaxLi10&#8722;2xP4N10 (x=2, 2.7, 4) and Sr3Li4P4N10, prepared via a simplified ion exchange reaction under MP conditions, starting from the nitridophosphate&#8208;based lithium ion conductor Li10P4N10. The synthesis route allowed for the preservation of the anionic [P4N10]10&#8722; structural motif of the starting material, while simultaneously introducing potential doping sites for Eu2+ by incorporating divalent alkaline earth cations (Ca2+/Sr2+). Upon excitation of Eu2+ doped samples with blue light, strong luminescence due to parity&#8208;allowed 4f6(7F)5d1&#8594;4f7(8S7/2) transition can be observed in the red (Ca2Li6P4N10&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+: &#955;max=626&#8197;nm), yellow/orange (Ca2.7Li4.6P4N10&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+: &#955;max1=506&#8197;nm, &#955;max2=592&#8197;nm and Sr3Li4P4N10&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+: &#955;max=596&#8197;nm) and green (Ca4Li2P4N10&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+: &#955;max=546&#8197;nm) spectral regions of the visible light. The compounds presented, together with the simplified synthetic approach, demonstrate the significant potential of ion exchange on Li ion conductors for the development of novel nitridophosphates in the future.

         <title>Two&#8208;Phase Perchlorate Activation Enabled by a Dinuclear Fe&#8208;NHC (N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the perchlorate activation process in microbes, a dinuclear Fe&#8208;NHC (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) complex was developed in this work to facilitate the two&#8208;phase activation of perchlorate through the cooperation of bimetallic centers. With the aid of photoirradiation, the oxidative potential of perchlorate could be released in a controllable manner to achieve the homocoupling of hydrocarbon substrates.







Abstract
Perchlorate, initially regarded as a weakly coordinating counterion rather than a reactive oxidizing reagent due to its kinetic stability, has garnered attention for its potential in microbial systems. Under anaerobic conditions, microbes utilize perchlorate as a terminal oxidant for methane oxidation, involving two distinct stages: extraction and release of oxidizing ability. This two&#8208;phase activation process necessitates the collaborative action of multiple enzymes, a phenomenon not extensively explored in artificial systems. To address this issue, a dinuclear Fe&#8208;NHC (N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) complex 1 was designed to enable the two&#8208;phase activation of perchlorate. Initially, complex 1 extracts the oxidative potential of perchlorate, leading to the formation of Fe(III)&#8208;O&#8722;Fe(III) complex 2 as the oxidation product. Subsequently, the extracted oxidative potential can be released by photolyzing a mixture of complex 2 and 9,10&#8208;dihydroanthracene. In contrast to the commonly observed selectivity, the homocoupling product 5 was identified as the major product in this C&#8722;H activation reaction. Further, a catalytic C&#8722;H activation reaction is initiated under anaerobic conditions to selectively form the C&#8722;C coupling product, achieving the complete two&#8208;phase activation of perchlorate using a single artificial catalyst. This work provides a new paradigm for constructing biomimetic anaerobic oxidation using kinetically inert high&#8208;valent oxygenated acid anions as oxidants.

         <title>A Base&#8208;Free Two&#8208;Coordinate Oxoborane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A base&#8208;free, two coordinate oxoborane (R&#8208;BO) has been isolated as a Lewis adduct with AlCl3 and shown to react in a unique way with PhN3. In contrast to the parent oxoborane, the oxoborane&#8594;AlCl3 adduct is stable towards oligomerisation and C&#8722;H cleavage of the Mes* group as AlCl3 coordination provides thermodynamic stabilization while also reducing the basicity of the oxygen unit thus reducing the biphilic character of the BO unit.







Abstract
Oxoboranes (R&#8208;BO) are transient species that rapidly trimerise to form boroxines. To date, the only method used to stabilise oxoboranes is to add a Lewis base, but this forms a three&#8208;coordinate at boron oxoborane that has a different bonding/reactivity profile. Herein we report a base&#8208;free, two&#8208;coordinate oxoborane that is isolated as a Lewis adduct with AlCl3. This species, Mes*BO&#8208;AlCl3 (Mes*=2,4,6&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H2), has a &#957;11&#914;&#927; stretching frequency of 1843&#8197;cm&#8722;1, indicating a strong BO bond. Computational analysis indicates this is due to a highly polarised BO bonding interaction combined with modest BO multiple bond character. While the polarisation of the BO bond on AlCl3 coordination enhances the Lewis acidity at boron it also reduces the basicity at oxygen and the latter is key to accessing a base&#8208;free oxoborane. Finally, this oxoborane reacts with PhN3 in a unique way to form an unprecedented boron heterocycle.

A strategy using crown ether as ion&#8208;selective mobility differential amplifiers for enhancing the pressure&#8208;induced voltage response in ionic polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogels, leading to an advanced human somatosensory network analogous piezoionic skin.







Abstract
Piezoionics is an emerging mechanical&#8208;electrical energy conversion paradigm that enables self&#8208;powered sensing systems for next&#8208;generation intelligent wearable electronics. However, there are currently no rational design approaches to enhance the stimulus response of piezoionic devices. Here, we present a strategy using crown ether as ion&#8208;selective mobility differential amplifiers for enhancing the pressure&#8208;induced voltage response in ionic polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogels. The crown ether grafted PVA (PVA&#8208;CE) hydrogel prototype achieves a 30&#8208;fold amplified piezoionic coefficient of 1490 nV Pa&#8722;1 within 0&#8211;1&#8197;kPa, compared to 49 nV Pa&#8722;1 of the unmodified PVA. The PVA&#8208;CE exhibits an ultra&#8208;low pressure detection limit of 0.2&#8197;Pa with a fast response time of 18.1&#8197;ms. Leveraging these properties, we further demonstrate arrayed pressure sensing with a PVA&#8208;CE piezoionic skin, analogous to the human somatosensory network. These capabilities hold great promises for emerging healthcare applications such as synthetic biology, soft robotics, and beyond.

         <title>Flexible ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite Membrane for High&#8208;Performance Helium Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous and scalable ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite membranes have been successfully fabricated on polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) polymer supports. The prepared ZSM&#8208;5 membranes exhibit high flexibility that allows helium separation from natural gas under various circumstances. The helium separation performance exceeds those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes.







Abstract
Flexible zeolite membranes are promising for scalable and adaptable separation of critical gases such as helium; however, the synthesis of such membranes remains a significant challenge. In this study, we report the successful fabrication of crack&#8208;free ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite membranes on polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) supports using a seeded growth method. PTFE&#8208;supported membranes exhibit unprecedented helium permeance of over 6.7&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;mol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;Pa&#8722;1 and high He/N2 and He/CH4 separation factors of 17 and 83 respectively, surpassing current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes. These flexible membranes maintain excellent separation performance even after bending and stretching. Furthermore, large&#8208;scale membranes demonstrate stable helium separation from multicomponent gas mixtures, showcasing their significant potential for practical helium extraction from natural gas.

         <title>Designable Electrochemiluminescence Patterning for Renewable and Enhanced Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designable electrochemiluminescence patterning is achieved by focusing a 730&#8197;nm laser beam on the electrode surface. Through an in situ photothermal effect generated by the laser, which removes oxides formed by anodization, this approach enables enhanced bioimaging, highly sensitive immunoassays, and reversible luminescence&#8208;based anti&#8208;counterfeiting and encryption.







Abstract
Electrochemical imaging enables an in&#8208;depth analysis of the interface heterogeneity and reaction kinetics of single entities. However, electrode passivation during electrochemical reactions decreases the active sites and harms the long&#8208;term stability. Here, we introduce a method using laser&#8208;induced photothermal effects to restore the electrochemical activity, which is particularly displayed as enhanced micrometric patterns in electrochemiluminescence (ECL) microscopy. By co&#8208;localization characterization and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the mechanism of active site regeneration is validated as the removal of the oxide film for restoring the local surface ECL reactivity under laser irradiation. The surface&#8208;confined and voltage&#8208;dependent features of ECL allows for easy pattern erasure and rewriting, and it shows good reversibility and anti&#8208;counterfeiting potential. This approach overcomes the passivation processes, evidently improves the image quality of single biological entities including Shewanella bacteria and cells, and makes the subtle contour structures more distinct. The renewable electrode interface also enhances the ECL signal of model bead&#8208;based bioassays. This approach not only showcases precise control in fabricating micron patterns but also holds promise for enhancing the sensitivity in electrochemical immunoassays and bioimaging.

         <title>Strontium Doped IrOx Triggers Direct O&#8722;O Coupling to Boost Acid Water Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
The discovery of efficient and stable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic conditions is crucial for the commercialization of proton&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolyzers. In this work, we propose a Sr(OH)2&#8208;assisted method to fabricate a (200) facet highly exposed strontium&#8208;doped IrOx catalyst to provide available adjacent iridium sites with lower Ir&#8722;O covalency. This design facilitates direct O&#8722;O coupling during the acidic water oxidation process, thereby circumventing the high energy barrier associated with the generation of *OOH intermediates. Benefiting from this advantage, the resulting Sr&#8722;IrOx catalyst exhibits an impressive overpotential of 207&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4. Furthermore, a PEMWE device utilizing Sr&#8722;IrOx as the anodic catalyst demonstrates a cell voltage of 1.72&#8197;V at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and maintains excellent stability for over 500&#8197;hours. Our work not only provides guidance for the design of improved acidic OER catalysts but also encourages the development of iridium&#8208;based electrocatalysts with novel mechanisms for other electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Outstanding Circularly Polarized TADF in Chiral Cu(I) Emitters: From Design to Application in CP&#8208;TADF OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral Cu(I) emitters exhibiting circularly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;TADF) with a record&#8208;high quantum yield (close to 100&#8201;%) and high dissymmetry factor (|glum|~1&#215;10&#8722;2) have been developed. Based on these emitters, efficient CP&#8208;TADF OLEDs with high |gEL| factors of 1.5&#215;10&#8722;2 were fabricated. It was also discovered that a magnetic field significantly suppresses the CP&#8208;TADF of chiral Cu(I) emitters.







Abstract
Low&#8208;cost molecular emitters that merge circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties are attractive for many high&#8208;tech applications. However, the design of such emitters remains a difficult task. To address this challenge, here, we propose a simple and efficient strategy, demonstrated by the design of pseudochiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal complexes [Cu(L*)DPEPhos]PF6 bearing a (+)/(&#8722;)&#8208;menthol&#8208;derived 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligand (L*). These complexes exhibit a yellow CP&#8208;TADF with a record&#8208;high quantum yield (close to 100&#8201;%) and high dissymmetry factor (|glum|~1&#215;10&#8722;2). Remarkably, the above compounds also show a negative thermal&#8208;quenching (NTQ) of luminescence in the 300&#8211;77&#8197;K range. Exploiting the designed Cu(I) emitters, we fabricated efficient CP&#8208;TADF OLEDs displaying mirror&#8208;imaged CPL bands with high |gEL| factors of 1.5&#215;10&#8722;2 and the maximum EQE of 6.15&#8201;%. Equally important, using the (+)&#8208;[Cu(L*)DPEPhos]PF6 complex, we have discovered that an external magnetic field noticeably suppresses CP&#8208;TADF of Cu(I) emitters. These findings are an important contribution to the CPL phenomenon and provide access to highly efficient, low&#8208;cost and robust CP&#8208;TADF emitters.

         <title>Restricting Linker Rotation in Nanocages of ZIF&#8208;8 Membranes using Crown Ether &#8220;Molecular Locks&#8221; for Enhanced Propylene/Propane Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzo&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 (15C5) molecules were in&#8197;situ encapsulated within the sodalite cage of the ZIF&#8208;8 membranes to restrict their flexible pore structure. The resulting 15C5@ZIF&#8208;8 membranes exhibited exceptional C3H6/C3H8 selectivity, reaching 220, significantly surpassing most other membranes. Remarkably, as pressure increased, the separation factor continued to rise, achieving a record&#8208;high C3H6/C3H8 separation factor of 331 at 7&#8197;bar.







Abstract
ZIF&#8208;8 membranes have long been prized for their exceptional C3H6/C3H8 separation performance. On the other hand, ZIF&#8208;8 has structural flexibility, where the external pressure triggers channel expansion, potentially deteriorating the molecular sieving ability. Here, we demonstrate a reliable strategy to fine&#8208;tune the flexible pore structure of ZIF&#8208;8 by embedding crown ether within a ZIF&#8208;8 membrane. Benzo&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 (15C5) was selected as the cavity occupant and perfectly confined in the sodalite (SOD) cage of ZIF&#8208;8. The 15C5 molecules, which have a size comparable to the nanocage, impose a spatial constraint on linker rotation, enabling the phase transition to a rigid structure in the flexible ZIF&#8208;8. The corresponding 15C5@ZIF&#8208;8 membranes achieve an ultrahigh C3H6/C3H8 selectivity of 220, outperforming that of most membranes. Unlike their flexible counterparts, the resulting membranes manifest a positive increase in the C3H6/C3H8 separation factor with elevated pressure, securing a record&#8208;high C3H6/C3H8 separation factor of 331 under 7&#8197;bar. More importantly, extraordinary separation stability was demonstrated with continuous measurement, which is highly desirable for practical applications.

         <title>Molecular Trapdoor in HEU Zeolite Enables Inverse CO2&#8208;C2H2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The adsorptive separation of molecules with very similar physical properties is always a challenging task. Reported herein is the design and tailoring of zeolite adsorbent for the precise discrimination and separation of CO2&#8208;C2H2 mixture through the pronounced trapdoor effect. Typically, Sr exchanged K&#8208;type clinoptilolite, namely Sr/K&#8208;HEU, is developed as a robust zeolite adsorbent for inverse CO2&#8208;C2H2 separation, showing the&#8208;state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art dynamic CO2/C2H2 selectivity of 48.0 and sustainable CO2 dynamic uptake of 0.96 mmol/g at the same time. The perfect recyclability and the intrinsic low&#8208;cost nature of S/Kr&#8208;HEU make it a promising candidate for practical applications. Three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction determines the precise structure of Sr/K&#8208;HEU and density functional theory calculations reveal the intricate interplay between guest molecules and the gate&#8208;keeping extraframework cations. Briefly, extraframework Sr2+ cations from the ten&#8208;membered rings of HEU zeolites act as the molecular trapdoor, allowing the entry of CO2 molecules while excluding C2H2. This work presents a new example of molecular trapdoor in zeolite and its successful application in the challenging inverse CO2&#8208;C2H2 separation, which not only expands the scope of molecular trapdoor concept but also improves current understanding on the nature of molecular trapdoor.</dc:description>

         <title>General and Fast Gas&#8211;Solid Synthesis of Functional MXenes and Derivatives on the Scale of Tens of Grams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rising of MXenes not only enriches the two&#8208;dimensional material family but also brings more opportunities for diverse functional applications. However, the controllable synthesis of MXenes is still unsatisfied via the common liquid&#8208;solid etching route, considering the unsolved problems like safety risk, time cost and easy oxidation. Herein, a facile yet efficient gas&#8208;solid (G&#8208;S) reaction methodology is devised by using hydrogen fluoride gas derived from fluorinated organics as the MAX etchant toward high&#8208;efficiency fabrication of multiple MXenes and their derivatives. The innovative G&#8208;S reaction strategy exhibits superb versatility to achieve different gram&#8208;level MXenes (V2C, Ti3C2, Nb2C, Ti2N, Ti3CN, (Mo2/3Y1/3)2C) in a very short time, and even realizes in&#8208;situ heteroatom doping or synchronous phase conversion of MXenes directly from MAX phases. The obtained MXenes and their derivatives exhibit excellent structure stability and high electron/ion conductivity, making them promising materials for electrochemical applications. In particular, the N&#8208;doped V2C MXene shows superior adsorption and catalytic activity toward lithium polysulfides for advanced lithium sulfur batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Cell&#8208;sensing Analogue Nanopore for Rapid Detection of Protein&#8208;Related Targets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanopores offer significant advantages in biosensing. Conventional nanopore sensors require probe modification within the pore, and there are two major obstacles: inhomogeneity of probe modification within the pore, and distortion of the detection signal due to the uncontrollable dynamics of the target within the pore. Here, we constructed a cell&#8208;sensing analogue nanopore (CeSa&#8208;nanopore), by coating the outer surface of the nanopore with cell membrane. The inhomogeneity of probe modification and the uncontrollable kinetics of target&#8208;probe binding were also addressed. Specific cells are selected to prepare CeSa&#8208;nanopore, for example, cells with high expression of angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) are used to achieve the detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. When SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 binds to CeSa&#8208;nanopore the surface potential changes, causing a change in the ionic current, thus enabling its detection with a detection rate of 100%. In addition, the detection of different proteins, such as follicle&#8208;stimulating hormone (FSH), can be achieved by changing the cell membrane coating. The identification of cancer cells in ascites can also be achieved by utilizing homologous targeting between cancer cells. Importantly, the use of CeSa&#8208;nanopores for the detection of these targets eliminates the need for pre&#8208;processing and significantly reduces detection time.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective and Enantioselective Hydropyridylation of Dienes for the Synthesis of Chiral Diaryl Compounds via Concerted Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of chiral 1,1&#8208;diaryl compounds, particularly those containing a pyridine moiety, is of significant interest due to their pharmaceutical applications. Here, we report the development of a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective 1,4&#8208;hydropyridylation of conjugated dienes. Utilizing 2&#8208;fluoropyridine as the electrophile, CuOAc, and the chiral ligand Tol&#8208;BINAP, we optimized reaction conditions to achieve the desired chiral 1,1&#8208;diaryl products containing both a pyridine and a cis&#8208;crotyl group. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations revealed that the 1,2&#8208;hydrocupration step is enantio&#8208;determining, and the concerted nucleophilic aromatic substitution proceeds via six&#8208;membered cyclic transition states.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Organized Integrated Electrocatalyst on Oxygen Conversion for Highly Durable Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are key for clean energy applications such as rechargeable metal&#8208;air batteries. Highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts have been the focus of great attention by scientists. Here, an innovative and continuous growth method is established to fabricate integrated Janus structure Co3O4/CoNGDY catalyst, which can work for bifunctional oxygen catalytic conversion, achieving highly durable zinc&#8208;air batteries. Embedded in the hydrangea&#8208;shaped N&#8208;doped graphdiyne (NGDY), the Co3O4/CoNGDY is self&#8208;organized by CoNGDY at the NGDY contact sites and Co3O4 at the upper part, in which Co3O4 works as OER catalyst and CoNGDY acts as ORR catalyst. Due to the incomplete charge transfer within integrated structure, NGDY reduces the d&#8208;band center of the Co sites, so the adsorption strength of intermediates is balanced, and the catalytic activity for ORR/OER is increased. The Co3O4/CoNGDY can serve as an efficient air electrode of rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries. The rechargeable Co3O4/CoNGDY&#8208;based aqueous zinc&#8208;air batteries demonstrate excellent performance with a high specific capacity of 746.8 mAh g&#8722;1 and an extremely long lifetime of more than 5000 hours. The recoverable modularized cylindrical Co3O4/CoNGDY&#8208;based solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;air batteries with a power density of up to 167.6 mW cm&#8722;2 can be achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular&#8208;level Modulation of N, S&#8208;co&#8208;doped Mesoporous Carbon Nanospheres for Selective Aqueous Catalytic Oxidation of Ethylbenzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective oxidation of aromatic alkanes into high value&#8208;added products through benzylic C&#8212;H bond activation is one of the main reactions in chemical industry. On account of the constantly increasing demand for mass production, efficient, eco&#8208;friendly and sustainable catalysts are urgently needed. Herein, we describe a facile and versatile emulsion&#8208;assisted interface self&#8208;assembly strategy towards molecular&#8208;level&#160;fabrication of co&#8208;doped mesoporous carbon nanospheres with controllable active N&#160;and&#160;S species. The method enables a high degree of control over nanoparticle sizes, mesoporous nanostructures, contents of heteroatoms and the chemical composition. The optimized catalyst exhibits high catalytic performance of 97% ethylbenzene conversion and 98% selectivity to acetophenone. Density functional theory simulations reveal that N, S&#8208;co&#8208;doping leads to&#160;the&#160;redistribution of charge and spin densities, introducing more active carbon atoms and realizing aerobic oxidation of ethylbenzene efficiently. This work presents a general strategy for molecular&#8208;level design of carbon&#8208;based catalysts, and also provides new insight into the influence of heteroatom&#8208;doping on catalytic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochromic Organic Micro&#8208;Laser</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work presents the first demonstration of a mechanochromic organic micro&#8208;laser, which exhibits remarkable wide range pressure sensing characteristics. The gain material, pinacolato boronate ester functionalized anthanthrene (AnBPin), is designed by incorporating mechanofluorochromic (MFC) properties into organic laser dye. The AnBPin exhibits a reversible transition between green and orange fluorescence upon grinding annealing and recrystallization cycle, and its micro&#8208;crystal exhibits typical organic micro&#8208;laser behaviors. Applying localized mechanical pressure as low as 0.1 MPa inhibits micro&#8208;laser behavior at the given spot. In contrast, under 1 to 2 GPa hydrostatic pressure, the organic laser maintains narrow emission while showing a pressure&#8208;dependent shift in emission wavelength. By combining theory and experimentation, we attribute the unusual pressure&#8208;correlated emission spectroscopy to the unique interleaved locked crystal structure. Understanding the mechanochromic laser behavior in AnBPin micro&#8208;crystals under an unprecedented pressure range significantly expands the family of organic micro&#8208;lasers and provides a new route for wide&#8208;range photonic pressure detection.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Water Splitting in Isoindigo&#8208;based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing a low&#8208;cost, robust, and high&#8208;performance electrocatalyst capable of efficiently performing both the oxygen evolution reaction&#160;and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under both basic and acidic conditions is a major challenge. This area of research has attracted much attention in recent decades due to its importance in energy storage and conversion. Herein, we report the synthesis of two imine&#8208;linked isoindigo&#8208;based covalent organic networks.&#160; The combination of isoindigo dialdehyde with a planar triazine core, leads to the formation of thin, highly crystalline, planar 2D&#8208;nanosheets covalent organic framework (I&#8208;TTA COF), whereas its combination with ionic non&#8208;planar guanidinium core leads to an amorphous covalent organic polymer (I&#8208;TG COP) with a fibrous morphology. The sheet&#8208;like crystalline I&#8208;TTA COF shows better electrocatalytic activity compared to the amorphous fibrous I&#8208;TG COP. I&#8208;TTA exhibits a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 at an overpotential of ~134 mV for HER (in 0.5 M H2SO4) and ~283 mV for OER (in 1 M KOH). The electrocatalytic activity of the I&#8208;TTA COF in the OER exceeds that of other metal&#8208;free COFs. The catalytic activity is maintained even after 24 hours of chronoamperometry and 500 cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV) at high scan rates.</dc:description>

         <title>Transmembrane Delivery of an Aryl Azopyrazole Photo&#8208;switchable Ion Transporter Relay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli&#8208;responsive synthetic ionophores allow for spatial and temporal control over ion transport, with promise for applications in targeted therapy. Relay transporters have emerged as a new class of ion transporters &#8208; these are anchored carriers that sit in both leaflets of the bilayer and mediate transport across the membrane by passing ions between them. The relays are themselves membrane impermeable, and so must be incorporated into the membrane during vesicle preparation. Here we show that relay transporters can be delivered to both sides of the membrane of vesicles using a synthetic flippase. By incorporating an aryl azopyrazole photo&#8208;switch into the movable arm of the relay transporters the ion transport activity can be very efficiently and reversibly switched between off and on states. This control is achieved by extension and contraction of their movable arms via photo&#8208;isomerization of the central aryl azopyrazole moiety, hence modulating the ability of the relays to pass ions across the membrane.</dc:description>

         <title>Amplified Cascade Catalysis for RAFT Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a conceptually new amplified cascade catalysis that converts oxygen to hydroxyl radical for controlled RAFT polymerization. This catalysis consists of two sequential reactions, deoxygenation catalyzed by glucose oxidase and Fenton reaction catalyzed by ferrocene. The two catalysts can communicate with each other, leading to ferrocene recycling and hence amplification in radical generation. Ferrocene recycling was confirmed by UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy, molecular docking simulation, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, as well as polymerization studies. This catalysis was applied to RAFT polymerization of various monomers, yielding well&#8208;defined homopolymers and diblock copolymers with controlled molecular weights and low dispersities. Poly(N,N&#8208;dimethyl acrylamide) with molecular weight over 1 million g mol&#8208;1 was also successfully synthesized under ambient conditions. Ferrocene&#8208;functionalized microspheres were prepared and used as recyclable Fenton catalyst for five consecutive polymerizations with minimal declination in monomer conversion, which further improved the ecofriendly character of this polymerization methodology.</dc:description>

         <title>A Direct Chemical Repair of Etheno&#8208;Type RNA Damages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Etheno damages in RNA represent a unique class of structural alterations that arise from exposure to various environmental stressors or endogenous processes. They significantly distort the RNA structure and affect crucial biological functions, including RNA&#8208;protein interactions, ribosome function, and translation fidelity. However, repair mechanisms for those etheno damages in RNA are still being elucidated. Here, a synthetic flavin derivative PS9 has been identified as the first example of chemical repair approach for this type of RNA damages. It efficiently managed the removal of etheno&#8208;type &#949;A and &#949;C damages in nucleosides, oligonucleotides in vitro, and in E. coli RNA in vivo under blue light irradiation. The capacity of the chemical approach relies on a unique cycloaddition activation of the etheno&#8208;bridge with singlet oxygen, which is distinct from traditional epoxidation of the C=C double bonds by proteins from the AlkB family. The understanding and effective manipulation of etheno damages in RNA with chemical tools hold implications for deciphering their role in mutagenesis and RNA biology, potentially opening avenues for targeted therapeutic interventions and biomarker development.</dc:description>

         <title>Ce3+/Ce4+ Ion Redox Shuttle Stabilized Cu&#948;+ for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction to C2H4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The CO2 electroreduction reaction has advantages in clean and pollution&#8208;free carbon conversion, but it still faces challenges in carbon utilization efficiency and improving the selectivity of C2+ products. Although the dynamic Cu&#948;+ state is known to favor the C&#8208;C coupling process, the Cu&#948;+ species suitable for electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 are difficult to maintain under the conditions of strong reduction and large current. Herein, we propose a Ce doping strategy (Ce/CuOx) to protect the Cu&#948;+ state in the CO2RR process, which enables a high Faradaic efficiency of 60% for multi&#8208;carbon products (40% for C2H4, 14% for CH3CH2OH, and 6% for CH3COOH), and 25 h stability at &#8208;1.2 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. In&#8208;situ infrared spectroscopy, in&#8208;situ XPS combined with density functional theory calculations reveal that the Cu&#948;+ is stabilized by the redox ion pairs of Ce, which reduces the energy barrier of *CO coupling, and improves the Faraday efficiency of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction of C2H4. This work provides an idea to make full use of lanthanide variable value metals to maintain the stability of dynamic Cu&#948;+ state and improve the performance of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to C2H4.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Strategy for the Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Branched Human Milk Oligosaccharides Containing the Lacto&#8208;N&#8208;biose Motif</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) exhibit prebiotic, antimicrobial, and immunomodulatory properties and confer significant benefits to infants. Branched HMOs are constructed through diverse glycosidic linkages and prominently feature the lacto&#8208;N&#8208;biose (LNB, Gal&#8208;&#946;1,3&#8208;GlcNAc) motif with fucose and/or sialic acid modifications, displaying structural complexity that surpasses that of N&#8208; and O&#8208;glycans. However, synthesizing comprehensive libraries of branched HMO is challenging due to this complexity. Although a few systematic synthetic strategies have emerged, many of them rely on labor&#8208;intensive chemical methodologies or exploit the substrate specificity of human N&#8208;acetylglucosaminyltransferase 2 (hGCNT2). In this study, we capitalized on the substrate promiscuities of hGCNT2 and bacterial glycosyltransferases (GTs) to construct a universal tetrasaccharide core in a highly efficient manner. This core was systematically and flexibly extended to generate diverse branched HMOs utilizing the promiscuity of bacterial GTs coupled with N&#8208;trifluoroacetyl glucosamine (GlcNTFA), which facilitated sugar chain elongation. The GlcNTFA residues were subsequently converted into various N&#8208;modified glucosamines through straightforward chemical manipulations to modulate the activities of additional GTs during glycan extension. These masked amino groups were ultimately reverted to N&#8208;acetyl groups, facilitating the synthesis of a broad range of asymmetric and multiantennary HMOs featuring LNB moieties, including many previously inaccessible structures.</dc:description>

In this study, we capitalized on the substrate promiscuities of hGCNT2 and bacterial glycosyltransferases (GTs) to construct a universal tetrasaccharide core in a highly efficient manner. This core was systematically and flexibly extended to generate diverse branched HMOs utilizing the promiscuity of bacterial GTs coupled with N-trifluoroacetyl glucosamine (GlcNTFA), which facilitated sugar chain elongation. The GlcNTFA residues were subsequently converted into various N-modified glucosamines through straightforward chemical manipulations to modulate the activities of additional GTs during glycan extension. These masked amino groups were ultimately reverted to N-acetyl groups, facilitating the synthesis of a broad range of asymmetric and multiantennary HMOs featuring LNB moieties, including many previously inaccessible structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hollow Pt&#8208;Encrusted RuCu Nanocages Optimizing OH Adsorption for Efficient Hydrogen Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As one of the best candidates for hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), ruthenium (Ru) has attracted significant attention for anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), although it suffers from sluggish kinetics under alkaline conditions due to its strong hydroxide affinity. In this work, we develop ternary hollow nanocages with Pt epitaxy on RuCu (Pt&#8208;RuCu NCs) as efficient HOR catalysts for application in AEMFCs. Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations confirm that the synergy in optimized Pt8.7&#8208;RuCu NCs significantly modifies the electronic structure and coordination environment of Ru, thereby balancing the binding strengths of H* and OH* species, which leads to a markedly enhanced HOR performance. Specifically, the optimized Pt8.7&#8208;RuCu NCs/C achieves a mass activity of 5.91 A mgPt+Ru&#8208;1, which is ~3.3, ~2.2, and ~15.0 times higher than that of RuCu NCs/C (1.38 A mgRu&#8208;1), PtRu/C (1.83 A mgPt+Ru&#8208;1) and Pt/C (0.37 A mgPt&#8208;1), respectively. Impressively, the specific peak power density of fuel cells reaches 15.9 W mgPt+Ru&#8208;1, significantly higher than those of most reported PtRu&#8208;based fuel cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Unconventional Heterobidentate Coordination of 4&#8208;Hydroxypyridine Leading to Remarkably Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation in Zn(C5H4NO)2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report an unconventional heterobidentate coordination mode of conventional 4&#8208;hydroxypyridine ligand in a novel compound Zn(C5H4NO)2. The strong heterobidentate coordination interactions between Zn2+ and 4&#8208;hydroxypyridine ligands promote a uniform alignment of the polarization of each [ZnO2N2] tetrahedral building unit, resulting in remarkably strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) with an intensity that is the largest among all UV&#8208;transparent Zn&#8208;containing metal&#8208;organic compounds, reaching 13.6 &#215; KDP. Moreover, Zn(C5H4NO)2 processes a suitable optical bandgap of 4.40 eV, high thermal stability up to 300 &#176;C, excellent air stability, and strong water resistance, demonstrating great application potential. Additionally, Zn(C5H4NO)2 exhibits photoluminescence with a significantly enhanced lifetime of 558 ms, accompanied by a rare blue afterglow visible to the naked eye, lasting up to 5 s.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Electron Oxidative Atom and Group Transfer Reactions at a Well&#8208;Defined Uranium(II) Center</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The multi&#8208;electron redox chemistry of uranium(II) compounds remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report a series of two&#8208;electron oxidative atom and group transfer reactions at a well&#8208;defined uranium(II) center. The reactions of uranium(II) complexes [M][(AdTPBN3)U] (M = K(2,2,2&#8208;cryptand) and K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)(THF)) with pyridine&#8208;N&#8208;oxide or nitrosobenzene, elemental sulfur/selenium or triphenylphosphine sulfide/selenide, and ditellurium salt led to the isolation of uranium(IV) terminal oxo and chalcogenido complexes [M][(AdTPBN3)UX] (X = O, S, Se, Te). In addition, the reactions of [M][(AdTPBN3)U] with aryl azides ArN3 or diazoalkanes R2CN2 quantitatively yielded uranium(IV) terminal imido [M][(AdTPBN3)UNAr] or hydrazonido(2&#8211;) complexes [M][(AdTPBN3)UN2CR2], respectively. Notably, the low&#8208;temperature reaction between [M][(AdTPBN3)U] and mesityl azide allowed the isolation of the first uranium(IV) aryldiazenylimido complex as an intermediate. These uranium(IV)&#8211;element multiply bound compounds were fully characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, 1H NMR spectroscopy, absorption spectroscopy, solution magnetic susceptibility, and elemental analysis. The controlled two&#8208;electron oxidative reactions at a uranium(II) center not only expand the redox reactivity of uranium(II) but also offer a convenient new route to access uranium&#8211;element multiply bound compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>H Induced Metal&#8208;Insulation Transition Boosts the Stability of High Temperature Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (HT&#8208;PEMFCs) have garnered significant attention due to their expanded range of hydrogen sources and simplified management systems. However, the frequent start&#8208;up and shut&#8208;down (SU/SD)&#160;caused fuel starvation&#160;operation condition seriously deteriorates the performance and lifetime of the fuel cell.&#160;In this manuscript, VO2&#160;was incorporated in the anode&#160;to restrain fuel starvation&#160;of the electrode. Under the operation condition, the insulative VO2&#160;would reversibly&#160;transform into metallic HxVO2&#160;by&#160;intercalating hydrogen, and HxVO2&#160;can automatically release hydrogen,&#160;which&#160;could&#160;act as the hydrogen buffer&#160;and suppress reverse&#8208;current degradation. After the hydrogen release, the generated insulating VO2&#160;would prevent the&#160;side reactions during fuel starvation.&#160;Compared&#160;to the traditional&#160;Pt anode, the electrode&#160;with VO2&#160;showed much higher&#160;output power&#160;and greatly improved durability after fuel starvation.

         <title>Elucidating Confinement and Microenvironment of Ru Clusters Stably Confined in MFI Zeolite for Efficient Propane Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving active and stable heterogeneous catalysts by encapsulating noble metal species within zeolites is highly promising for high utilization and cost efficiency in thermal and environmental catalytic reactions. Ru considered an economical noble metal alternative with comparable performance, faces great challenges within MFI&#8208;type microporous zeolites due to its high cohesive energy and mobility. Herein, an innovative strategy was explored coupling hydrothermal in situ ligand protection with stepwise calcination in a flowing atmosphere to embed ultrasmall Ru clusters anchored at K+&#8208;healed silanol sites (&#8801;Si&#8211;Ru&#948;+&#8208;O&#8208;K complexes) within 10&#8208;membered ring sinusoidal channels of MFI. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations unveiled that the interplay between confined Ru clusters and MFI induces local strain in MFI, creating a unique catalytic microenvironment around the Ru clusters. This synergy exhibits superior alkane deep oxidation, performance owing to the confined Ru clusters and the MFI microenvironment collectively pre&#8208;activate C3H8 and O2, facilitate the cleavage of C&#8208;H and C&#8208;C bonds at low temperatures. Notably, the stable geometric and electronic properties of confined Ru show exceptional thermal stability up to 1000 &#176;C, rivaling fresh catalysts. These findings shed vital methodological and mechanistic insights for developing efficacious heterogeneous catalysts for thermal catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Precisely Tailoring the Second Coordination Sphere of a Cobalt Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Selective Hydrogenation of Halogenated Nitroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective nonprecious metal catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of halogenated nitroarenes is very appealing yet challenging. Here, we demonstrate that the hydrogenation activity and selectivity of Co single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) can be tuned by tailoring the structure of second coordination sphere via P doping. As revealed by synchrotron radiation&#8208;based X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy characterizations, such a P doping on N&#8208;coordinated Co SAC results in the unsymmetric Co&#8208;N4P1 coordination structure. With a combination of experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations, we find that tailoring the second coordination sphere can greatly improve H2 dissociation and product desorption. As a result, the Co&#8208;N4P1 SAC exhibits superior activity, selectivity and stability for the hydrogenation of halogenated nitroarenes to corresponding amines (20 examples, &gt;99% yields) at 80 oC under 0.5 MPa H2 pressure, significantly outperforming most heterogeneous catalysts reported in the literature. We expect that this work opens a new avenue for the design of highly efficient nonprecious metal SACs for important hydrogenation reactions.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The development of highly efficient and cost-effective nonprecious metal catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of halogenated nitroarenes is very appealing yet challenging. Here, we demonstrate that the hydrogenation activity and selectivity of Co single-atom catalyst (SAC) can be tuned by tailoring the structure of second coordination sphere via P doping. As revealed by synchrotron radiation-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy characterizations, such a P doping on N-coordinated Co SAC results in the unsymmetric Co-N4P1 coordination structure. With a combination of experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations, we find that tailoring the second coordination sphere can greatly improve H2 dissociation and product desorption. As a result, the Co-N4P1 SAC exhibits superior activity, selectivity and stability for the hydrogenation of halogenated nitroarenes to corresponding amines (20 examples, &amp;gt;99% yields) at 80 oC under 0.5 MPa H2 pressure, significantly outperforming most heterogeneous catalysts reported in the literature. We expect that this work opens a new avenue for the design of highly efficient nonprecious metal SACs for important hydrogenation reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Optically Modulated Nanofluidic Ionic Transistor for Neuromorphic Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Neuromorphic systems that can emulate the behavior of neurons have garnered increasing interest across interdisciplinary fields due to their potential applications in neuromorphic computing, artificial intelligence and brain&#8208;machine interfaces. However, the optical modulation of nanofluidic ion transport for neuromorphic functions has been scarcely reported. Herein, inspired by biological systems that rely on ions as signal carriers for information perception and processing, we present a nanofluidic transistor based on a metal&#8208;organic framework membrane (MOFM) with optically modulated ion transport properties, which can mimic the functions of biological synapses. Through the dynamic modulation of synaptic weight, we successfully replicate intricate learning&#8208;experience behaviors and Pavlovian associate learning processes by employing sequential optical stimuli. Additionally, we demonstrate the application of the International Morse Code with the nanofluidic device using patterned optical pulse signals, showing its encoding and decoding capabilities in information processing process. This study would largely advance the development of nanofluidic neuromorphic devices for biomimetic iontronics integrated with sensing, memory and computing functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermal Bistability of Magnetic Susceptibility, Light Absorption, Second Harmonic Generation, and Dielectric Properties in a Polar Spin&#8208;Crossover Iron&#8211;Rhenium Chain Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bistability of multiple physical properties driven by external stimuli in a solid is a desired prerequisite for its application in memory devices with convenient data readout. We present a pathway for thermal bistability detectable in four physical properties: magnetic, light absorption, second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG), and dielectric. We report a novel heterometallic (TBA){[FeII(phIN)4][ReV(CN)8]}&#183;(phIN) (1) (TBA = tetrabutylammonium cation, phIN = phenyl isonicotinate) cyanido&#8208;bridged chain material. Owing to an appropriate {N6} coordination sphere of Fe(II) centers, 1 reveals a thermal spin crossover (SCO) effect which is complete and cooperative providing a distinct thermal hysteresis loop in magnetic measurements. Moreover, it exhibits simultaneous thermal bistability in (a) visible&#8208;light absorption due to the presence of efficient d&#8208;d electronic transitions in the low&#8208;spin (LS) state, (b) SHG activity as it crystallizes in a polar Cc space group due to the bulky substituent on phIN ligands, and (c) dielectric parameters, including dielectric constant, which can be correlated with subtle changes in polarity between LS and HS (high spin) phases. Thus, we present a remarkable thermally controlled hysteretic behavior in four physical functionalities realized by properly functionalizing an SCO&#8208;active coordination compound.</dc:description>

         <title>Pseudohalide Anions Driven Structural Modulation in Distorted Tetrahedral Manganese(II) Hybrids toward Tunable Green&#8208;Red Emissions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mn(II)&#8208;based halides have recently garnered significant interest as emerging luminescence materials for diverse photonic applications. Generally, Mn(II) hybrids with tetrahedral coordination show green emission, however, ones with octahedral coordination give red emission. Herein, we design the synthesis of tetrahedral Mn(II) pseudohalide hybrids, (RPh3P)2MnBrxNCS4&#8208;x (R= phenyl, pentyl or methyl; Ph3P = triphenylphosphine; x = 1 &#8208; 3), achieved by gradually substituting bromides with pseudohalides (NCS&#8722;). Compared to the green&#8208;emitting A2MnBr4 (512 nm), the mixed hybrids exhibit significantly distorted [MnBrxNCS4&#8208;X] tetrahedra with high dipole moment, thus leading to the distinct Stokes shift energies and noticeable red shift emission in the range of 549 ~ 613 nm. Furthermore, the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of these hybrids correlates strongly with the pair correlation function of Mn(II) ions, specifically the Mn&#183;&#183;&#183;Mn distance. These findings highlight the critical role of dipole moments in determining the emission properties and expand the luminescent family of Mn(II) pseudohalide hybrids.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative active sites on Ag2Pt3TiS6 for enhanced low&#8208;temperature ammonia fuel cell electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia has attracted considerable interest as a hydrogen carrier that can help decarbonize global energy networks. Key to realizing this is the development of low temperature ammonia fuel cells for the on&#8208;demand generation of electricity. However, the efficiency of such systems is significantly impaired by the sluggish ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Here, we report the design of a bifunctional Ag2Pt3TiS6 electrocatalyst that facilitates both reactions at activities exceeding that of commercial Pt/C. Through comprehensive density functional theory simulations, we identify that active site motifs composed of Pt and Ti atoms work cooperatively to catalyze ORR and AOR. Notably, in&#8208;situ shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS) experiments indicate a decreased propensity for *NOx formation and hence an increased resistance toward catalyst poisoning for AOR. Employing Ag2Pt3TiS6 as both the cathode and anode, we constructed a low temperature ammonia fuel cell with a high peak power density of 8.71 mW cm&#8208;2 and low Pt loading of 0.45 mg cm&#8208;2. Our findings demonstrate a pathway towards the rational design of effective electrocatalysts with multi&#8208;element active sites that work cooperatively.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Priority recognition separation of inert and larger ethane molecules from high&#8208;concentration ethylene mixtures instead of traditional thermodynamic or size sieving strategy is a fundamental challenge. Herein, we report the ethane triggered gate&#8208;opening in the flexible&#8208;robust metal&#8722;organic framework Zn(ad)(min), the 3&#8208;methylisonicotinic acid ligand can spin as a flexible gate when adsorbing the cross&#8208;section well&#8208;matched ethane molecule, thus achieving the unprecedent ethane adsorption capacity (62.6&#160;cm3 g&#8208;1) and ethane/ethylene uptake ratio (3.34) under low&#8208;pressure region (0.1 bar and 298 K). The ethane&#8208;induced structural transition behavior is uncovered by a collaboration of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, in&#8208;situ variable pressure X&#8208;ray diffraction and theoretical calculations, elucidating the synergetic mechanism of cross&#8208;section matching and multiple supramolecular interactions within the tailor&#8208;made pore channels.

         <title>Moir&#233; Lattice of Twisted Bilayer Graphene as Template for Non&#8208;Covalent Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a novel approach to achieve spatial variations in the degree of non&#8208;covalent functionalization of twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG). The tBLG with twist angles varying between ~5&#176;&#160;and 7&#176;&#160;was non&#8208;covalently functionalized with 1,4,5,8,9,11&#8208;hexaazatriphenylenehexacarbonitrile (HATCN) molecules. Our results show a correlation between the degree of functionalization and the twist angle of tBLG. This correlation was determined through Raman spectroscopy, where areas with larger twist angles exhibited a lower HATCN peak intensity compared to areas with smaller twist angles. We suggest that the HATCN adsorption follows the moir&#233; pattern of tBLG by avoiding AA&#8208;stacked areas and attach predominantly to areas with a local AB&#8208;stacking order of tBLG, forming an overall ABA&#8208;stacking configuration. This is supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our work highlights the role of the moir&#233; lattice in controlling the non&#8208;covalent functionalization of tBLG. Our approach can be generalized for designing nanoscale patterns on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials using moir&#233; structures as a template. This could facilitate the fabrication of nanoscale devices with locally controlled varying chemical functionality.</dc:description>

This is supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our work highlights the role of the moir&#233; lattice in controlling the non-covalent functionalization of tBLG. Our approach can be generalized for designing nanoscale patterns on two-dimensional (2D) materials using moir&#233; structures as a template. This could facilitate the fabrication of nanoscale devices with locally controlled varying chemical functionality.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrafast Luminescence Detection with Selective Adsorption of Carbon Disulfide in a&#160;Gold(I) Metal&#8722;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although a widely used and important industrial chemical, carbon disulfide (CS2) also poses a number of hazards due to its volatility and toxicity. As such, the development of multifunctional materials for the selective capture and easy recognition of CS2&#160;is one of the crucial issues. Herein, we demonstrate completely selective CS2&#160;adsorption among trials involving H2O, alcohols, volatile organic compounds (including thiol derivatives), N2, H2, O2, CH4, CO, NO, and CO2. We also showcase its fine detection using remarkable luminescent response in an Au(I)&#8208;based metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF) of {ZnII(pz)[AuI(CN)2]2} (pz = pyrazine;&#160;1) with a two&#8208;fold interpenetration network.&#160;Ex situ&#160;single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction for&#160;1&#160;and CS2&#160;accommodated&#160;1&#160;suggested that the Au&#183;&#183;&#183;Au atoms are not only luminescent centers but also act as interaction sites for CS2&#160;modulating the Au&#183;&#183;&#183;Au contacts. These experiments revealed the specificity of CS2&#160;and how changes in the CS2&#8208;induced structure.&#160;Based on the obtained structural formation,&#160;1&#160;exhibited a sensitive detecting ability for CS2&#160;with an ultrafast response time of less than 10 s. Ex situ&#160;time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence analyses developed in this work implied that CS2&#160;varied the energetic relaxation at the excited states related to the luminescent efficiency of the resultant MOF system.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Chemiluminophore Switches Photodynamic Processes via Protein Complexation for Biomarker&#8208;Activatable Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the potential in cancer therapy, phototheranostic agents often face two challenges: limited diagnostic sensitivity due to tissue autofluorescence and suboptimal therapeutic efficacy due to the Type&#8208;II photodynamic process with the heavy oxygen reliance. In contrast, chemiluminescent theranostic agents without the requirement of real&#8208;time light excitation can address the issue of tissue autofluorescence, which however have been rarely reported for photodynamic therapy (PDT), not to mention less oxygen&#8208;dependent Type&#8208;I PDT. In this work, we synthesize NIR chemiluminophores with the specific binding towards human serum albumin (HSA) to form chemiluminophore&#8208;protein complex for cancer detection and photodynamic therapy. Interestingly, after the complexation with HSA, the chemiluminescence (CL) intensities of chemiluminophores are enhanced by over 10&#8208;fold; meanwhile, the photodynamic process switches from Type&#8208;II (singlet&#8208;oxygen&#8208;generation dominated) to Type&#8208;I (superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical dominated), while the previously reported activated chemiluminophore with non&#8208;specific HSA binding can&#8217;t switch photodynamic process. Based on the optimal chemiluminophore, a nitroreductase&#8208;activatable CL probe&#8208;protein complex is synthesized, which specially turns on its CL and Type&#8208;I PDT in hypoxic tumors for precision therapy. Thus, this study provides a complexation strategy to improve phototheranostic performance of chemiluminophores.</dc:description>

         <title>Skeletal Nitrogen Functionalization of Isostructural 2D Conjugated MOFs for Enhancement of the Dual&#8208;Ion Storage Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) are emerging as promising electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage. However, a viable path to realize superior dual&#8208;ion storage in 2D c&#8208;MOFs has remained elusive. Here, we report the synthesis of Cu2(Nx&#8208;OHPTP) 2D c&#8208;MOFs (x=0,1,2; OHPTP=octahydroxyphenanthrotriphenylene) with precise aromatic carbon&#8208;nitrogen arrangements, based on the &#960;&#8208;conjugated OHPTP ligand incorporated with one or two nitrogen atoms. The skeletal nitrogen modification in Cu2(Nx&#8208;OHPTP) allows the synergistic introduction of additional redox sites, and thus substantially favors the unique dual&#8208;ion adsorption capacity. Consequently, the Cu2(N2&#8208;OHPTP) cathode exhibits a largely enhanced electrochemical performance for dual&#8208;ion storage (i.e., Li+ and Cl&#8208;) with a high specific capacity of 53.8 mAh g&#8722;1, which is twice that of Cu2(N0&#8208;OHPTP) and 1.3 times that of Cu2(N1&#8208;OHPTP). Furthermore, the Cu2(N2&#8208;OHPTP) electrode displays a favorable rate performance of 52% and good cycling stability of 96% after 1000 cycles. We identify N&#8208;centered redox sites as additional Li+ adsorption sites. In addition, calculations underline the synergistic enhancement of the Cl&#8722; adsorption energy by about 1.0 eV at the more electron&#8208;poor CuO4 linkages after N&#8208;incorporation. This work paves the way for the precise design of 2D c&#8208;MOFs with superior electrochemical properties, advancing their application in dual&#8208;ion storage applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here an electrocatalyst that exhibits superior performance in the electrooxidation of ethanol. The reactive centers of the catalyst have a nest&#8208;type configuration with outer Zn&#8208;NxC nest covering inner PtZn intermetallic compound nanoparticle loaded on carbon support (ZnNC&#8834;PtZn/C). The high&#8208;energy stepped facets of the inner PtZn nanoparticle confined and shaped by the outer Zn&#8208;NxC nest is highly active for the critical C&#8208;C bond cleavage of ethanol in oxidation, confirmed by experimental characterizations and density functional theory calculations. The catalyst shows a rare high&#8208;performance and demonstrates a mass activity of 3.7 A mgPt&#8208;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 78.2%, following the C1 pathway of reaction and the retention of initial activity remains 97% after 5,000 cycles. The unique configuration, also mitigating the concentration polarization, endows the catalyst with innate ethanol electrooxidation property by inner&#8208;outer synergic interactions, leading to unexpected power output of an acidic direct ethanol fuel cell.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Molecular Design for Balanced Locally Excited and Charge&#8208; Transfer Nature for Two&#8208;Photon Absorption Phenomenon and Highly Efficient TADF&#8208;Based OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pursuit of highly efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters with two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) character is hampered by the concurrent achievement of a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST) and high photoluminescence quantum yield (&#1060;PL). Here, by introducing a terephthalonitrile unit into a sterically crowded donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;donor structure, inducing a hybrid electronic excitation character, we designed unique TADF emitters possessing 2PA ability. This rational molecular design was achieved through a main &#960;&#8208;conjugated donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor backbone in line with locally excited feature renders a large oscillator strength and transition dipole moment, maintaining a high 2PA cross&#8208;section value. The ancillary N&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor with charge transfer character highly balances the TADF phenomenon by minimizing &#916;EST. A near&#8208;unity &#1060;PL value with a large radiative decay rate over an order of magnitude higher than the intersystem crossing rate and a high horizontal orientation ratio of 0.95 were simultaneously attained for TPCz2NP. The organic light&#8208;emitting diodes fabricated with this material exhibit a high maximum external quantum efficiency of 25.4% with an elevated 2PA cross&#8208;section (&#963;2) value up to 143&#160;GM at 850 nm. These findings offer a venue for designing high&#8208;performance TADF emitters with exceptional performance inclusive of 2PA properties, expanding for future functional material design.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Molecule Functionalization Enables Selective Electrochemical Reduction of Dilute CO2 Feedstock</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical conversion of low&#8208;concentration CO2 feedstock to value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels is a promising pathway for achieving direct valorization of waste gas streams. However, this is challenging due to significant competition from the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and lowered CO2 reduction (CO2R) kinetics as compared to systems that employ pure CO2. Here we show that terephthalic acid (TPA) functionalization can boost selectivity towards CO2R and suppress HER over a range of catalysts including Bi, Cu and Zn. For instance, TPA functionalized Bi attained a formate Faradaic efficiency (FEHCOO&#8208;) of 96.3% at 300 mA cm&#8208;2 with pure CO2 feedstock. Density functional theory simulations indicate that this is because TPA functionalization modulates the binding energies of the key reaction intermediates *OCHO and *H. With low&#8208;concentration feedstock (15% CO2) at 100 mA cm&#8208;2, we achieved a high FEHCOO&#8208; of 85.8%, which was double that of an unmodified Bi catalyst. Using an electrolyzer with a porous solid electrolyte layer, we successfully showcase 30 h of continuous high&#8208;purity formic acid production from dilute CO2. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that molecular tuning of a catalyst can be an effective strategy for enabling selective CO2R using low&#8208;concentration feedstock.</dc:description>

         <title>Chalcogen Bonds Enable Efficient Photoreduction of Sulfur&#8208;Containing Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using ab initio molecular dynamics and excited&#8208;state calculations we demonstrate that the formation of chalcogen bonds between hydrosulfide anions and an organic heteroaromatic chromophore containing a sulfur atom enables efficient photoinduced electron transfer and photoreduction.







Abstract
Chalcogen bonding interactions have attracted significant attention in a broad chemistry community, with a particular focus on their ability to stabilise the key transition states in various organic synthetic routes. In this work, we demonstrate that they can also be harnessed in selective photoredox reactions, which cannot be otherwise achieved with alternative approaches to photoreduction. We demonstrate this concept through the photoreduction of the sulfur&#8208;containing DNA nucleoside precursor thioanhydrouridine to 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;thiouridine, revealing the previously unrecognized role of bisulfide in this process. Based on quantum chemical simulations, we identify a stable chalcogen&#8208;bonding complex of the hydrosulfide anion and thionhydrouridine (HS&#8722;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S contacts), which enables directional photoinduced electron transfer, resulting in the formation of non&#8208;canonical DNA nucleoside. We also disprove the possibility that photoreduction of thioanhydronucleosides could be initiated by hydrated electrons generated from irradiated bisulfide anions which do not interact with the chromophore. Finally, we show that selective photoreduction mediated by chalcogen bonds can only occur for chromophores, which exhibit sufficiently long excited&#8208;state lifetimes in the locally&#8208;excited states to undergo transition to the productive charge transfer state. These findings can be further used in the design of similar photoredox reactions which can employ the potential of chalcogen bonding interactions.

         <title>Antioxidative Therapy of Alcoholic Liver Injury by Amorphous Two&#8208;Dimensional Cobalt Hydroxide Nanocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel nanocatalytic antioxidation approach is proposed for alcoholic liver injury therapy by developing amorphous Co(OH)2 nanosheets with a desirable hepatic passive targeting ability, as well as a high catalytic antioxidative activity, resulting in an efficient and sustainable ROS&#8208;scavenging effect in the liver.







Abstract
The intake of excessive ethanol will activate an alternative ethanol metabolic pathway in the liver, resulting in the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which further leads to alcoholic liver injury (ALI). Although several molecular antioxidants have been utilized in clinics for treating ALI, their efficacies are still less satisfactory. In this work, a nanocatalytic antioxidation therapeutic strategy is proposed for ALI treatment by constructing amorphous Co(OH)2 nanosheets with catalytic antioxidative property. The bis(&#956;&#8208;hydroxo)CoIICoII dinuclear active sites of Co(OH)2 nanosheets are capable of coordinating with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) with significantly reduced thermodynamic barrier to form a dihydroxyl adduct bis(&#956;&#8208;hydroxo)CoIII(OH)CoIII(OH) favorable for catalytic H2O2 disproportionation, while amorphous and ultrathin structure further facilitates the reaction, resulting in a high catalytic efficiency (Km=59.31&#8197;mM). Thanks to the inherent hepatic passive targeting ability of nanomaterials, the antioxidative nanosheets can accumulate in liver region efficiently after intravenous administration (35.5&#8201;% ID/g accumulation efficiency), enabling efficient catalytic antioxidation in the liver to mitigate hepatic oxidative stress, protect hepatocytes from apoptosis/ferroptosis. This study provides a new methodology of nanocatalytic antioxidation for treating ALI and other hepatic diseases related to oxidative stress.

         <title>Side Chain Phenyl Isomerization&#8208;Induced Spatial Conjugation for Achieving Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared II Phototheranostic Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Side chain phenyl positional isomerization induces strong intermolecular spatial conjugation, simultaneously improving the fluorescence brightness and photothermal properties of phototheranostic agents in the near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) window. The obtained o&#8208;ITNP NPs excels in high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise NIR&#8208;II angiography, tumor localization, and NIR&#8208;II imaging&#8208;guided tumor photothermal therapy.







Abstract
The contradiction of near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) emission and photothermal effects limits the development of phototheranostic agents (PTAs) in many emerging cutting&#8208;edge applications. Organic aggregates present a promising opportunity for the balance of competitive relaxation processes through the manipulation of molecular structure and packing. Herein, side chain phenyl isomerization&#8208;induced spatial conjugation was proposed for constructing A&#8208;D&#8208;A type NIR&#8208;II PTAs with simultaneous enhancement of fluorescence brightness and photothermal properties. Three pairs of mutually isomeric fluorophores, whose phenyls respectively located at the outside (o&#8208;series) and inside (i&#8208;series) of the side chain, were designed and synthesized. The positional isomerization of the phenyl endows the o&#8208;series crystals with strong spatial conjugation between the phenyl group on the side chain and the backbone, as well as interlocked planar network, which is different to that observed in the i&#8208;series. Thus, all o&#8208;series nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit red&#8208;shifted absorption, enhanced NIR&#8208;II emission, and superior photothermal properties than their i&#8208;series counterparts. A prominent member of the o&#8208;series, o&#8208;ITNP NPs, demonstrated efficacy in facilitating NIR&#8208;II angiography, tumor localization, and NIR&#8208;II imaging&#8208;guided tumor photothermal therapy. The success of this side chain phenyl isomerization strategy paves the way for precise control of the aggregation behavior and for further development of efficient NIR&#8208;II PTAs.

         <title>Long&#8208;Term Single&#8208;Molecule Tracking in Living Cells using Weak&#8208;Affinity Protein Labeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;labeling protein tag in combination with exchangeable fluorophore ligands bypasses photobleaching and enables long&#8208;term single&#8208;molecule imaging in living cells. This extends observation times in single cells and enables direct monitoring of ligand&#8208;induced receptor activation in living cells.







Abstract
Single&#8208;particle tracking (SPT) has become a powerful tool to monitor the dynamics of membrane proteins in living cells. However, permanent labeling strategies for SPT suffer from photobleaching as a major limitation, restricting observation times, and obstructing the study of long&#8208;term cellular processes within single living cells. Here, we use exchangeable HaloTag Ligands (xHTLs) as an easy&#8208;to&#8208;apply labeling approach for live&#8208;cell SPT and demonstrate extended observation times of individual living cells of up to 30&#8197;minutes. Using the xHTL/HaloTag7 labeling system, we measure the ligand&#8208;induced activation kinetics of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in single living cells. We generate spatial maps of receptor diffusion in cells, report non&#8208;uniform distributions of receptor mobility, and the formation of spatially confined &#8216;hot spots&#8217; of EGFR activation. Furthermore, we measured the mobility of an ER&#8208;luminal protein in living cells and found diffusion coefficients that correlated with the ER nano&#8208;structure. This approach represents a general strategy to monitor protein mobility in a functional context and for extended observation times in single living cells.

         <title>Using Near&#8208;Infrared Irradiation for Heating Mechanochemical Reactions in Organic&#8208;Dye&#8208;Doped Epoxy Milling Jars</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New milling jars, made of epoxy resin doped with an organic dye, were manufactured to perform heat&#8208;controlled organic transformations upon NIR irradiation. Reactions that require external heat even under solvent&#8208;free ball&#8208;milling conditions could then be performed efficiently.







Abstract
Albeit mechanochemistry is a novel promising technology that gives access to reactivity under solvent&#8208;free conditions, heating such reactions is sometimes compulsory to obtain satisfactory results in terms of conversion, selectivity and/or yield. In this work, we developed a novel approach using a dye that absorbs NIR photons and release the energy as heat. Hence, de novo milling jars in epoxy resin doped with the dye were thus produced to obtain reactors that would produce heat upon irradiation at 850&#8197;nm. Temperature profiles were recorded, depending on the irradiance, dye charge in the resin, and milling frequency, showing an excellent control of the temperature. The usefulness of the heating jar was then demonstrated in mechanochemical reactions that are known to require heat to yield the desired product, namely Diels&#8211;Alder reactions with high activation energies and the newly developed rearrangement of a sydnone into corresponding 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazolin&#8208;2&#8208;one.

         <title>Programmed Charge Transfer in Conjugated Polymers with Pendant Benzothiadiazole Acceptor for Simultaneous Photocatalytic H2O2 Production and Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron&#8208;donor backbone incorporating with pendant benzothiadiazole acceptor are elaborately designed to create directional charge&#8208;transfer channels in linear conjugated polymers (LCPs). This design efficiently directs electrons towards reduction centers, facilitating reactive oxygen species generation, while simultaneously guiding holes towards oxidation centers, thus significantly boosting photocatalytic H2O2 production and organic synthesis.







Abstract
While being important candidate for heterogeneous photocatalyst, conjugated polymer typically exhibits random charge transfers between the alternating donor and acceptor units, which severely limits its catalytic efficiency. Herein, inspired by natural photosystem, the concept of guiding the charge migration to specific reaction sites is employed to significantly boost photocatalytic performance of linear conjugated polymers (LCPs) with pendant functional groups via creating programmed charge&#8208;transfer channels from the backbone to its pendant moiety. The pendant benzothiadiazole, as revealed in both in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, can act as electron &#8220;reservoir&#8221; that aggregates electrons at the active sites. Moreover, the presence of charge&#8208;transfer channels, evidenced by transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS), accelerates the electron transfer, preventing the recombination of electrons and holes. As a result, in this elaborately&#8208;designed architecture, the photogenerated electron can move smoothly towards the reduction sites, facilitating the reduction of O2 into H2O2, while remaining holes are directed to oxidation centers, simultaneously oxidizing furfuryl alcohol to furoic acid. The optimized photocatalyst LCP&#8208;BT demonstrates a competitive catalytic performance with H2O2 productivity of 868.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 (9.8&#8197;times higher than conventional random charge&#8208;transfer polymer LCP&#8208;1) and furfuryl alcohol conversion over 95&#8201;% after 6&#8197;h.

         <title>Robust Bisulfite&#8208;Free Single&#8208;Molecule Real&#8208;Time Sequencing of Methyldeoxycytidine Based on a Novel hpTet3 Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
EMox&#8208;seq (enzymatic methylcytidine oxidation sequencing) enables bisulfite&#8208;free, single molecule sequencing of DNA methylation patterns at high precision with just a single enzymatic treatment step, using a high&#8208;performance Tet3 catalytic domain.







Abstract
In addition to the four canonical nucleosides dA, dG, dC and T, genomic DNA contains the additional base 5&#8208;methyldeoxycytidine (mdC). The presence of this methylated cytidine nucleoside in promoter regions or gene bodies significantly affects the transcriptional activity of the corresponding gene. Consequently, the methylation patterns of genes are crucial for either silencing or activating genes. Sequencing the positions of mdC in the genome is therefore of paramount importance for early cancer diagnostics as it helps determine incorrect gene expression. Currently, the bisulfite method is the gold standard for mdC&#8208;sequencing. However, this method has the drawback that the majority of the input DNA is degraded during the bisulfite treatment. Additionally, bisulfite sequencing is prone to errors. Here, we report a benign, bisulfite&#8208;free mdC sequencing method termed EMox&#8208;seq, which is based on third&#8208;generation single&#8208;molecule SMRT sequencing. The foundation of this technology is a new Tet3 enzyme that efficiently oxidizes mdCs to 5&#8208;carboxycytidine (cadC). In turn, cadC provides an excellent readout by SMRT sequencing using specially trained AI&#8208;based algorithms.

         <title>Mesoporous Electrodes Enhance the Electrocatalytic Performance of [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metalloenzyme [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase from Clostridium pasteurianum (&#8220;CpI&#8221;) can be utilized for electroenzymatic hydrogen production under ambient conditions and neutral pH. Mesoporous indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes have a hierarchical morphology with cavities and well&#8208;defined nanoparticle agglomerates, enhancing the electroenzymatic performance CpI.







Abstract
The metalloenzyme [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase is of interest to future biotechnologies targeting the production of &#8220;green&#8221; hydrogen (H2). We recently developed a simple two&#8208;step functionalized procedure to immobilize the [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase from Clostridium pasteurianum (&#8220;CpI&#8221;) on mesoporous indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes to achieve elevated H2 production with high operational stability and current densities of 8&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Here, we use a combination of atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) to understand how mesoporous ITO stabilizes and activates CpI for electroenzymatic H2 production. Examination of the topography and morphology of the mesoporous ITO surface revealed a hierarchical morphology containing cavities and well&#8208;defined nanoparticle agglomerates. Any potential effect of mesoporosity was investigated by comparing the stability and electroenzymatic activity of CpI on mesoporous &#8216;nanoITO&#8217; and planar ITO, where we determined that CpI has a higher turnover frequency and adsorbs with greater stability (with respect to electroenzymatic activity over time) to nanoITO surfaces.

         <title>Aeration&#8208;Free Photo&#8208;Fenton&#8208;Like Reaction Mediated by Heterojunction Photocatalyst toward Efficient Degradation of Organic Pollutants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;vacancy VO&#8722;M&#8722;Co3O4@CNx S&#8208;Scheme heterostructure with optimized defect concentration was successfully constructed, displaying excellent PMS activation ability synergized with photoexcitation for degrading organic pollutants without aeration. Emphasizing the competitive interaction between O2 and PMS within the catalyst is pivotal for controlling the synergistic photoexcitation of PMS for the first time.







Abstract
The regulation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation by photo&#8208;assisted heterogeneous catalysis is under in&#8208;depth investigation with potential as a replaceable advanced oxidation process in water purification, yet it remains a significant challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a strategy to construct polyethylene glycol (PEG) well&#8208;coupled dual&#8208;defect VO&#8722;M&#8211;Co3O4@CNx S&#8208;scheme heterojunction to degrade organic pollutants without aeration, which dramatically provides abundant active sites, excellent photo&#8208;thermal property, and distinct charge transport pathway for PMS activation. The degradation rate of VO&#8722;M&#8722;Co3O4@CNx in anaerobic conditions shows a higher efficient rate (4.58&#8197;min&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;2) than in aerobic conditions (1.67&#8197;min&#8722;1 g&#8722;2). Experimental evidence reveals that VO&#8722;M&#8722;Co3O4@CNx promotes more rapid redox conversion of photoexcited electrons induced by defects with PMS under anaerobic conditions compared to aerobic conditions. Additionally, in situ experiments and DFT provide mechanistic insights into the regulation pathway of PMS activation via synergistic defect&#8208;induced electron, revealing the competitive effect between O2 and PMS over VO&#8722;M&#8722;Co3O4@CNx during the reaction process. The continuous flow reactor and flow cytometry results demonstrated that the VO&#8722;M&#8722;Co3O4@CNx/PMS/Vis system has remarkably enhanced stability and purification capability for removing organic pollutants. This work provides valuable insights into regulating the heterologous catalysis oxidation process without aeration through the photoexcitation synergistic PMS activation.

&lt;p&gt;The regulation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation by photo-assisted heterogeneous catalysis is under in-depth investigation with potential as a replaceable advanced oxidation process in water purification, yet it remains a significant challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a strategy to construct polyethylene glycol (PEG) well-coupled dual-defect V&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;M&#8211;Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@CN&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; S-scheme heterojunction to degrade organic pollutants without aeration, which dramatically provides abundant active sites, excellent photo-thermal property, and distinct charge transport pathway for PMS activation. The degradation rate of V&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;M&#8722;Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@CN&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; in anaerobic conditions shows a higher efficient rate (4.58&#8197;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) than in aerobic conditions (1.67&#8197;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Experimental evidence reveals that V&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;M&#8722;Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@CN&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; promotes more rapid redox conversion of photoexcited electrons induced by defects with PMS under anaerobic conditions compared to aerobic conditions. Additionally, in situ experiments and DFT provide mechanistic insights into the regulation pathway of PMS activation via synergistic defect-induced electron, revealing the competitive effect between O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and PMS over V&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;M&#8722;Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@CN&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; during the reaction process. The continuous flow reactor and flow cytometry results demonstrated that the V&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;M&#8722;Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@CN&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/PMS/Vis system has remarkably enhanced stability and purification capability for removing organic pollutants. This work provides valuable insights into regulating the heterologous catalysis oxidation process without aeration through the photoexcitation synergistic PMS activation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Regeneration of Industrial LiFePO4 Black Mass Through A Glycerol&#8208;Enabled Granule Reconstruction Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a glycerol&#8208;enabled multi&#8208;faceted repair strategy, LiFePO4 industrial mass is regenerated at a low cost directly. The as&#8208;repaired LiFePO4 exhibits a high discharge capacity of 123.2&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 500&#8197;cycles at 5.0&#8197;C with a capacity retention rate of 93.1&#8201;%.







Abstract
With the increasing sales of electric vehicles, lots of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) assembled with LiFePO4 (LFP) cathodes will retire in the next few years, posing a significant challenge for their effective and environmentally&#8208;friendly recycling. The main reason why spent LFP cathodes fail to re&#8208;utilize lies in the lattice defects caused by lithium loss and structural defects resulting from stress accumulation. In this work, we propose an in situ granule reconstruction strategy to directly regenerate spent LFP black mass (S&#8722;BM) using glycerol in industry settings. The hydroxyl groups abundant in glycerol serves as electron donor that help reduce Fe&#8197;(III) and repair Fe&#8722;Li antisite defects (FeLi). Additionally, the chelating properties of glycerol intervene with structurally disintegrated particles, inhibiting Oswald ripening effect and promoting bonding of grain boundaries to generate lamellar microcrystals with homogeneous grain size, recover their morphology and crystal structure after a facile annealing procedure. Furthermore, the regenerated LFP restores Fe&#8722;O bonds which further inhibits structural distortion and improve Li+ migration kinetics. As a result, the regenerated industrial LFP black mass (R&#8722;BM) exhibits superior lithium storage performance with a discharge capacity of 123.2&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 500&#8197;cycles at 5.0&#8197;C (a capacity retention rate of 93.1&#8201;%).

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence/Photoacoustic Dual Ratiometric Probes with Unique Recognition Site for Quantitatively Visualizing H2S2 in Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have described a unique H2S2&#8208;mediated dithiole formation reaction under physiological conditions. Based on this reaction, we construct the first NIR&#8208;II fluorescence and photoacoustic dual&#8208;ratiometric probe (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;H2S2) for quantitatively and precisely visualizing H2S2 fluctuations in LPS/MET&#8208;induced liver injury.







Abstract
Hydrogen persulfide (H2S2) plays a significant role in redox biology and signal transduction; therefore, quantitative visualization of H2S2 in the deep tissue of living organisms is essential for obtaining reliable information about relevant pathophysiological processes directly. However, currently reported H2S2 probes are unsuitable for this purpose because of their poor selectivity for many polysulfide species or their short wavelength, which hinders precise imaging in deep tissues. Herein, for the first time, we report a unique H2S2&#8208;mediated dithiole formation reaction. Based on this reaction, we construct the first NIR&#8208;II fluorescence (FL) and photoacoustic (PA) dual&#8208;ratiometric probe (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;H2S2) for quantitatively visualizing H2S2 in vivo. This probe shows dual&#8208;ratiometric NIR&#8208;II fluorescence (I840/I1000, 107&#8208;fold) and photoacoustic (PA800/PA900, 6.5&#8208;fold) responses towards Na2S2 species with high specificity, excellent sensitivity (1.8&#8197;nM), improved water solubility, and deep&#8208;tissue penetration. More importantly, using NIR&#8208;II dual&#8208;ratiometric FL/PA imaging, we successfully demonstrated that the probe could be used to accurately quantify the fluctuating H2S2 levels in the liver&#8208;injury mouse models induced by lipopolysaccharides or metformin drugs. Overall, this study not only presents a promising tool for H2S2&#8208;related pathological research, but also provides a unique recognition site that may be generalized for designing more useful H2S2 imaging agents in the future.

         <title>Transmembrane Ion Channels: From Natural to Artificial Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion channels play a crucial role in various physiological and pathological processes. Their importance is multifaceted and spans multiple disciplines, including biology, medicine, and pharmacology. In this Review, we introduce natural channel proteins and their structural features, gating properties, and physiological functions. We also discuss bioinspired ion channels and their fabricating strategies, dynamic regulation, and therapeutic applications.







Abstract
Natural channel proteins allow the selective permeation of ions, water or other nutritious entities across bilayer membranes, facilitating various essential physiological functions in living systems. Inspired by nature, chemists endeavor to simulate the structural features and transport behaviors of channel proteins through biomimetic strategies. In this review, we start from introducing the inherent traits of channel proteins such as their crystal structures, functions and mechanisms. Subsequently, different kind of synthetic ion channels including their design principles, dynamic regulations and therapeutic applications were carefully reviewed. Finally, the potential challenges and opportunities in this research field were also carefully discussed. It is anticipated that this review could provide some inspiring ideas and future directions towards the construction of novel bionic ion channels with higher&#8208;level structures, properties, functions and practical applications.

         <title>Bioinspired &#8220;Intermolecular Pocket&#8221; in Soft Molecular Crystal of Porous Organic Cage Exhibiting Reversible Guest Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous organic cage (POC) with hydrophobic intermolecular &#8216;pockets&#8217; (HIMPs), constructed upon the lock of hydrophobic groups and disulfide bonds, has been achieved by biomimicking hydrophobic proteins. Similar to the specific substrate recognition observed in biological systems, NKPOC&#8208;DS exhibits selective &#8220;breathing behaviour&#8221; towards C2H6 through the expansion of its HIMPs, which makes NKPOC&#8208;DS a promising candidate for the one&#8208;step purification of C2H4 from a C2H6/C2H4 mixture.







Abstract
Porous Organic Cages (POCs) have gathered a lot of attention in sorts of fields. Previous studies often focused on the functionalization of their intrinsic porosity, while the utilization of the extrinsic porosity has been seldom reported. To date, the rational construction of functionalized extrinsic porosity in POCs is a serious challenge, which still relies on trial and error. Inspired by hydrophobic proteins, in the contribution, a POC (namely NKPOC&#8208;DS) is obtained with hydrophobic &#8220;intermolecular pocket&#8221; as extrinsic porosity constructed through the assembly of disulfide bonds with hydrophobic groups, facilitating strong supramolecular interactions as confirmed by Electrostatic Potential (ESP) maps and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Notably, NKPOC&#8208;DS exhibits a unique C2H6&#8208;selective &#8220;breathing behaviour&#8221; due to the presence of softness in its extrinsic porosity, which does not extend to other gases such as C2H4, CH4, CO2, N2, and H2. Such specific recognition of C2H6 thus provides NKPOC&#8208;DS with the ability to preferentially adsorb C2H6 from a C2H6/C2H4 mixture. The innovative approach of biomimicry in the design of functional POCs provides new insights into manipulating the packing of cages, paving the way for potential applications in guest recognition and adsorption separations.

Notably, NKPOC-DS exhibits a unique C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-selective &#8220;breathing behaviour&#8221; due to the presence of softness in its extrinsic porosity, which does not extend to other gases such as C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Such specific recognition of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; thus provides NKPOC-DS with the ability to preferentially adsorb C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; from a C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; mixture. The innovative approach of biomimicry in the design of functional POCs provides new insights into manipulating the packing of cages, paving the way for potential applications in guest recognition and adsorption separations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Operando Nature of Isobutene Adsorbed in Zeolite H&#8722;SSZ&#8722;13 Unraveled by Machine Learning Potentials Beyond DFT Accuracy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transfer learning approach is proposed to perform enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations with arbitrary accuracy. We study the chemisorption of isobutene in the H&#8722;SSZ&#8722;13 zeolite with RI&#8208;RPA and show that carbenium ions are not present in significant concentrations at reaction temperatures.







Abstract
Unraveling the nature of adsorbed olefins in zeolites is crucial to understand numerous zeolite&#8208;catalyzed processes. A well&#8208;grounded theoretical description critically depends on both an accurate determination of the potential energy surface (PES) and a reliable account of entropic effects at operating conditions. Herein, we propose a transfer learning approach to perform random phase approximation (RPA) quality enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations, thereby approaching chemical accuracy on both the determination and exploration of the PES. The proposed methodology is used to investigate isobutene adsorption in H&#8722;SSZ&#8722;13 as prototypical system to estimate the relative stability of physisorbed olefins, carbenium ions and surface alkoxide species (SAS) in Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acidic zeolites. We show that the tert&#8208;butyl carbenium ion formation is highly endothermic and no entropic stabilization is observed compared to the physisorbed complex within H&#8722;SSZ&#8722;13. Hence, its predicted concentration and lifetime are negligible, making a direct experimental observation unlikely. Yet, it remains a shallow minimum on the free energy surface over the whole considered temperature range (273&#8211;873&#8197;K), being therefore a short&#8208;lived reaction intermediate rather than a transition state species.

         <title>Aptamer and DNAzyme Based Colorimetric Biosensors for Pathogen Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pathogen detection is crucial for preventing and managing health risks. This review consolidates the selection of functional nucleic acids (FNAs) for pathogen detection and the development of cost&#8208;effective, simple diagnostic applications. It focuses on integrating FNAs with gold nanoparticles, polydiacetylenes, protein enzymes, G&#8208;quadruplexes, and nanozymes in colorimetric biosensors.







Abstract
The detection of pathogens is critical for preventing and controlling health hazards across clinical, environmental, and food safety sectors. Functional nucleic acids (FNAs), such as aptamers and DNAzymes, have emerged as versatile molecular tools for pathogen detection due to their high specificity and affinity. This review focuses on the in vitro selection of FNAs for pathogens, with emphasis on the selection of aptamers for specific biomarkers and intact pathogens, including bacteria and viruses. Additionally, the selection of DNAzymes for bacterial detection is discussed. The integration of these FNAs into colorimetric biosensors has enabled the development of simple, cost&#8208;effective diagnostic platforms. Both non&#8208;catalytic and catalytic colorimetric biosensors are explored, including those based on gold nanoparticles, polydiacetylenes, protein enzymes, G&#8208;quadruplexes, and nanozymes. These biosensors offer visible detection through color changes, making them ideal for point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics. The review concludes by highlighting current challenges and future perspectives for advancing FNA&#8208;based colorimetric biosensing technologies for pathogen detection.

         <title>Highly Solvating Electrolytes with Core&#8208;Shell Solvation Structure for Lean&#8208;Electrolyte Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The core&#8211;shell solvation structured electrolyte, with phosphoramide confined in the first solvation shell via hydrogen bonding, inhibits the contact reaction with Li metal, and stabilizes the [S3]&#8901;&#8722; radical thus promoting a rapid solution&#8208;mediated sulfur reaction pathway and achieving high sulfur utilization at lean electrolyte condition. The 2.71&#8208;Ah pouch cell achieves high specific energy of 307&#8197;W&#8201;h&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and shows stable cycling over 20 cycles.







Abstract
The practical energy density of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries is limited by the low sulfur utilization at lean electrolyte conditions. The highly solvating electrolytes (HSEs) promise to address the issue at harsh conditions, but the conflicting challenges of long&#8208;term stability of radical&#8208;mediated sulfur redox reactions (SRR) and the poor stability with lithium metal anode (LMA) have dimmed the efforts. We now present a unique core&#8211;shell solvation structured HSE formulated with classical ether&#8208;based solvents and phosphoramide co&#8208;solvent. The unique core&#8211;shell solvation structure features confinement of the phosphoramide in the first solvation shell, which prohibits severe contact reactions with LMA and endows prolonged stability for [S3]&#8901;&#8722; radical, favoring a rapid radical&#8208;mediated solution&#8208;based SRR. The cell with the proposed electrolyte showing a high capacity of 864&#8197;mAh&#8201;gsulfur&#8722;1 under high sulfur loading of 5.5&#8197;mgsulfur&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and low E/S ratio of 4&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mgsulfur&#8722;1. The strategy further enables steady cycling of a 2.71&#8208;A h pouch cell with a high specific energy of 307&#8197;W&#8201;h&#8201;kg&#8722;1. Our work highlights the fundamental chemical concept of tuning the solvation structure to simultaneously tame the SRR and LMA stability for metal&#8208;sulfur batteries wherein the electrode reactions are heavily coupled with electrolyte chemistry.

         <title>Stabilization of Ethane&#8208;Like Dianionic Diborane(6) in Monometallic Titanium Complexes and its Subsequent B(sp3)&#8722;B(sp3) Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ethane&#8208;like classical dianionic diborane(6) species stabilized by mononuclear Cp*Ti have been isolated and structurally characterized. Treatment of these diborane(6) species with [M(CO)5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF] (M=Mo or W) led to the cleavage of electron&#8208;precise B(sp3)&#8722;B(sp3) bonds that yielded &#312;3&#8208;hydridoborato complexes (see picture).







Abstract
Treatment of [Cp*TiCl3] with [LiBH4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF] followed by thermolysis with [Ph2E2] (E=S or Se) resulted in the formation of classical diborane(6) complexes, [(Cp*Ti)(&#951;4&#8208;B2H4LL&#8242;)] (L=C6H4E; L&#8242;=C6H5E; 1&#8201;a: E=S, 1&#8201;b: E=Se), stabilized at titanium template. To the best of our knowledge, they are the first examples of mono&#8208;metallic classical diborane(6) complexes. The bonding analysis and theoretical studies suggest that the stabilization of these diborane(6) species is due to the presence of four bridging ligands in &#312;4&#8208;fashion, where two of them are phenyl thiolates/selenolates that provide more electrons to the electron&#8208;deficient titanium center. Reactions of these diborane(6) species with [M(CO)5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF] (M=Mo, W) led to the cleavage of the electron&#8208;precise B(sp3)&#8722;B(sp3) bond that yielded &#312;3&#8208;hydridoborato complexes [(Cp*Ti)(&#312;3&#8208;BH3R)(&#956;&#8208;EPh)2{M(CO)4}] (2&#8201;a&#8211;c: R=H, 3&#8201;a&#8211;c: R=Ph). In an attempt to isolate the Te&#8208;analogue of 1&#8201;a&#8211;b, a similar reaction was performed; however, the complex was too unstable to be isolated. Interestingly, the treatment of this unstable intermediate with [W(CO)5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF] yielded [(Cp*Ti)(&#312;3&#8208;BH3R)(&#956;&#8208;TePh)2{W(CO)4}] (2&#8201;d: R=H, 3&#8201;d: R=Ph) that are analogues of 2&#8201;a&#8211;c and 3&#8201;a&#8211;c, respectively. Formation of these species provide indirect evidence for the existence of unstable [(Cp*Ti)(&#951;4&#8208;B2H4LL&#8242;)] (L=C6H4Te; L&#8242;=C6H5Te; 1&#8201;c).

To the best of our knowledge, they are the first examples of mono-metallic classical diborane(6) complexes. The bonding analysis and theoretical studies suggest that the stabilization of these diborane(6) species is due to the presence of four bridging ligands in &lt;i&gt;&#312;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;-fashion, where two of them are phenyl thiolates/selenolates that provide more electrons to the electron-deficient titanium center. Reactions of these diborane(6) species with [M(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF] (M=Mo, W) led to the cleavage of the electron-precise B(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;B(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;

In an attempt to isolate the Te-analogue of &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;, a similar reaction was performed; however, the complex was too unstable to be isolated. Interestingly, the treatment of this unstable intermediate with [W(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF] yielded [(Cp*Ti)(&lt;i&gt;&#312;&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Planar Pentacoordinate Halogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Planar pentacoordinate halogens present a challenge in chemistry, especially due to the electronegativity and restricted delocalization associated with halogens. Through extensive computational analysis, we identify a starlike D5h&#8208;symmetry global minimum structure in Li5X6&#8722; (X=F, Cl, Br) clusters, where the halogen is centrally positioned in a Li5X5 crown. Stability arises from electrostatic interactions, complemented by weak covalent dative bonding.







Abstract
Planar hypercoordinate motifs represent an intriguing frontier in chemistry, challenging traditional bonding norms. As electronegativity of the central atom increases, achieving planar hypercoordination becomes more difficult due to restricted delocalization, making the design of planar hypercoordinate halogens particularly puzzling. Here, we conduct an extensive computational survey of LinXn+1&#8722; (n=4, 5, 6; X=F, Cl, Br, I) clusters, revealing a starlike D5h&#8208;symmetry global minimum in Li5X6&#8722; (X=F, Cl, Br) with a planar pentacoordinate halogen (ppX), where X&#8722; is located at the center of Li5X5 crown. The clusters are stabilized predominantly through electrostatic interactions between X&#8722; and Li5X5, complemented by weak covalent bonding from dative interaction. Due to the weak orbital overlap, ppX clusters exhibit localized diatropic ring currents around X and Li.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Electrolyte Driven by Multi&#8208;Solvation Structures for Long&#8208;Lifespan Aqueous Zinc Metal Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy electrolyte (HEE) is prepared by mixing ternary ClO4&#8722;&#8208;based salts. Compared with conventional aqueous electrolyte (AqE) and high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (HCE), which have high water activity and big ion clusters, respectively, HEE exhibits reduced free water, small clusters, and multi&#8208;solvation structures. These provide HEE with anti&#8208;freezing properties and high ionic conductivity, enabling sustainable cycling in pouch cells.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs) are promising candidates for grid&#8208;scale energy storage due to their low cost and high safety. However, the poor stability and the unfavorable freezing point of aqueous electrolytes hinder their actual application. Herein, a ternary salts&#8208;based high&#8208;entropy electrolyte (HEE) composed of Zn0.2Na0.4Li0.4(ClO4)1.2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;7H2O is proposed to address the above issues. The addition of perchlorate salts with different cations reduces the size of ion clusters, significantly increases the solvation structure species, and promotes the anion&#8208;rich Zn2+ solvation structures, resulting in an enlarged electrochemical stability window, favorable viscosity and ionic conductivity, and low freezing point. Furthermore, advanced characterization and theoretical calculations confirm that multiple types of solvation structures effectively increase the entropy of the electrolyte. As a consequence, the Zn/Zn symmetric cells in HEE can sustainably cycle for at least 1000&#8197;hours and 1500&#8197;hours under room and subzero temperatures, respectively. The Na0.33V2O5/Zn and polyaniline/Zn full cells can even last for 30000 and 20000&#8197;cycles without capacity decay at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. The pouch cells employing HEE deliver promising capacity and stability, even at high mass loading of active materials. This strategy of introducing multiple salts with different cations to construct a high&#8208;entropy environment provides a facile approach for high&#8208;performance and long&#8208;lifespan AZMBs across a wide temperature range.

         <title>Effective Proton Conduction in Quasi&#8208;Solid Zinc&#8208;Manganese Batteries via Constructing Highly Connected Transfer Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We proposed a novel electrolyte with proton transfer properties suitable for AZMBs. The Pr3+, propionic acid and montmorillonite construct connected proton transfer pathways synergistically, and the Pr3+ participates the interfacial electric double layer of manganese deposition and enhances its electrochemical activity. This water&#8208;poor quasi&#8208;solid hybrid electrolyte could maintain cycle stability while also stimulates high specific capacity.







Abstract
Elusive ion behaviors in aqueous electrolyte remain a challenge to break through the practicality of aqueous zinc&#8208;manganese batteries (AZMBs), a promising candidate for safe grid&#8208;scale energy storage systems. The proposed electrolyte strategies for this issue most ignore the prominent role of proton conduction, which greatly affects the operation stability of AZMBs. Here we report a water&#8208;poor quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte with efficient proton transfer pathways based on the large&#8208;space interlayer of montmorillonite and strong&#8208;hydration Pr3+ additive in AZMBs. Proton conduction is deeply understood in this quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte. Pr3+ additive not only dominates the proton conduction kinetics, but also regulates the reversible manganese interfacial deposition. As a result, the Cu@Zn||&#945;&#8208;MnO2 cell could achieve a high specific capacity of 433&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.4&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an excellent stability up to 800 cycles with a capacity retention of 92.2&#8201;% at 0.8&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in such water&#8208;poor quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte for the first time. Ah&#8208;scale pouch cell with mass loading of 15.19&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 sustains 100 cycles after initial activation, which is much better than its counterparts. Our work provides a new path for the development of zinc metal batteries with good sustainability and practicality.

         <title>Novel Silicate Platform as Weakly&#8208;Coordinating Anions for Diverse Organometallic and Electrochemical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Weakly&#8208;coordinating anions based on Si are reported. These anions support a variety of cations relevant to organometallic and catalytic applications. The methyl&#8208;substituted anion has a wide electrochemical window and supports reversible Mg electrochemistry.







Abstract
Weakly&#8208;coordinating anions (WCAs) are employed in a wide range of applications, but limitations remain, including high reactivity, limited redox window, complicated synthesis, high cost, low solublity, and low structural tunabililty. Herein, we report a new class of WCA based on alkyl or aryl (R) substituted silicates bearing fluorinated pinacolate ligands, &#8220;[RSiF24]&#8722;&#8221;. Anions bearing a variety of R groups were prepared, enabling facile tuning of sterics and solubility. A range of cations employed in chemical reactivity has been supported by these anions, including ether&#8208;free alkali cations, Ag+, Ph3C+, Fc+, [NiI(COD)2]+. [Pd(dppe)(NCMe)Me]+ has been generated by salt metathesis or protonation of a metal&#8208;alkyl bond, showcasing the ability of the [RSiF24]&#8722; anions to support applications in coordination chemistry and catalysis. Electrochemical studies on the [Bu4N]+ variant show an exceptionally wide stability window for the [MeSiF24]&#8722; anion of 7.5&#8197;V in MeCN.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weakly-coordinating anions (WCAs) are employed in a wide range of applications, but limitations remain, including high reactivity, limited redox window, complicated synthesis, high cost, low solublity, and low structural tunabililty.

         <title>A Carbazole&#8208;Centered Expanded Helicene Stabilized with Hexabenzocoronene (HBC) Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbazole&#8208;centered expanded tris&#8208;hexabenzo[7]helicene has been synthesized by a facile FeCl3&#8208;mediated Scholl coupling reaction. The significant structural expansion resulted in a pronounced redshift in fluorescence emission as well as enhanced chemical and chiral stability.







Abstract
The synthesis and stabilization of heteroatom&#8208;doped nanocarbon molecules, such as carbazole&#8208;containing (super)helicenes, present significant challenges due to the complexities involved in maintaining structural integrity and electronic functionality. In this study, we successfully synthesized a carbazole&#8208;centered expanded tris&#8208;hexabenzo[7]helicene (1) via a facile FeCl3&#8208;mediated Scholl coupling reaction. 1 exhibits both chemical and chiral stability and demonstrates fluorescence at 628&#8197;nm with a quantum yield of 0.40. Additionally, the enantiomers of 1 display pronounced chiroptical properties, including a distinct circular dichroism (CD) signal spanning from 300 to 600&#8197;nm. The absorption dissymmetry factor (|gabs|) is determined to be 2.98&#215;10&#8722;3, while the circularly polarized luminescence brightness (BCPL) is measured as 32.50&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1.

         <title>Meta&#8208;Dimethylation of Arenes via Catellani Reaction from Aryl Thianthrenium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of a site&#8208;selective thianthrenation with a Catellani reaction provides access to 3,5&#8208;dimethylated arenes. The developed reaction is complementary to the previously discovered reductive ipso&#8208;alkylation of aryl thianthrenium salts and extends the possibilities for late&#8208;stage methylation of arenes with a single aryl thianthrenium salt.

         <title>Covalent Folding of Fluorinated Polyphenylene by Sulfur Fluorine Annulative Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monodisperse fluorinated polyphenylene undergoes folding&#8208;like sulfur fluorine annulative substitution (SFAS) to form a well&#8208;defined tubular helix H50. This is achieved with atomic precision in an exceptionally efficient manner, involving the simultaneous transformation of 98 C&#8722;F bonds with the yield per reaction site approaching 99.9&#8201;%. The desired product H50 features a fully fused dibenzothiophene skeleton of 5.8 helical turns in total and has an unambiguous single crystal X&#8208;ray structure. It can be resolved via chiral HPLC, displays distinct chiroptical properties, and forms strong through&#8208;cavity threading complex.

         <title>A Phosphotriester&#8208;Masked Dideoxy&#8208;cGAMP Derivative as a Cell&#8208;Permeable STING Agonist</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dideoxy analog of cGAS/STING second messenger 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP (cGAMP) was prepared using a new and concise synthetic combination of phosphoramidite and phosphotriester chemistry. By masking the negative charges of the phosphate backbones, the cellular uptake of cGAMP was highly increased from EC50=5&#8197;&#956;M to 25&#8197;nM.







Abstract
2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;Cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP (cGAMP) is a cyclic dinucleotide second messenger in which guanosine and adenosine are connected by one 3&#8242;&#8208;5&#8242; and one 2&#8242;&#8208;5&#8242; phosphodiester linkage. It is formed in the cytosol upon detection of pathogenic DNA by the enzyme guanosine&#8208;monophosphate&#8208;adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS). cGAMP subsequently binds to the adaptor protein stimulator of interferon genes (STING) to elicit an innate immune response leading to the production of type&#8197;I interferons and cytokines. STING agonists are a highly promising avenue for an immuno&#8208;oncological anticancer therapy. A particular challenge with cyclic dinucleotide STING agonists are the two negative charges of the phosphodiester linkages, which strongly reduce the ability of such compounds to penetrate cell membranes. The development of cell&#8208;permeable STING agonists that can stimulate the immune system enhancing their anticancer potency is currently of utmost importance in the field. Herein, we report the development of a dideoxy derivative of cGAMP as a phosphotriester prodrug, where the negative charge of the phosphate backbone has been masked with a thioester. We found that this thioester&#8208;protected compound features a dramatic increase in its cellular potency that rises from EC50=5&#8197;&#956;M to 25&#8197;nM. The new compound is envisioned to enable an efficient STING&#8208;agonist&#8208;based anticancer therapy.

         <title>Enantioselective Three&#8208;Component &#945;&#8208;Allylic Alkylation of &#945;&#8208;Amino Esters by Synergistic Photoinduced Pd/Carbonyl Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic photochemical Pd/carbonyl catalysis enables asymmetric &#945;&#8208;allylic alkylation of NH2&#8208;unprotected &#945;&#8208;amino esters with styrenes and alkyl bromides, affording an efficient new strategy for modular synthesis of quaternary &#945;&#8208;amino esters in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Photoinduced excited&#8208;state Pd catalysis has emerged as an intriguing strategy for unlocking new reactivity potential of simple substrates. However, the related transformations are still limited and the enantiocontrol remains challenging. Organocatalysis displays unique capability in substrate activation and stereocontrol. Combination of organocatalysis and photoinduced excited&#8208;state Pd catalysis may provide opportunities to develop new enantioselective reactions from simple substrates. By applying cooperative triple catalysis including excited&#8208;state Pd catalysis, ground&#8208;state Pd catalysis, and carbonyl catalysis, we have successfully realized enantioselective &#945;&#8208;allylic alkylation of &#945;&#8208;amino esters with simple styrene and alkyl halide starting materials. The reaction allows rapid modular assembly of the three reaction partners into a variety of chiral quaternary &#945;&#8208;amino esters in good yields with 90&#8211;99&#8201;% ee, without protecting group manipulations at the active NH2 group. The cooperation of the chiral pyridoxal catalyst and the chiral phosphine ligand accounts for the excellent chirality induction.

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive Aldehyde&#8208;Reduction Catalysis Through Catalyst Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light is an optimal stimulus to control the functioning of chemical systems, as it is clean, traceless, and easily applied. In this work we demonstrate a new way to couple catalytic activity to light input by encapsulating an aldehyde&#8208;reduction catalyst within a cage that opens upon illumination. This concept may enable illumination to be geared with catalytic activity for other reactions, including industrially relevant ones.







Abstract
We report a light&#8208;responsive tetrahedral metal&#8211;organic capsule that binds a perrhenate catalyst, which is released selectively upon irradiation with 350&#8197;nm light, turning on the catalytic reduction of organic carbonyls by hydrosilanes. The catalytic activity can be switched off by heating at 75&#8201;&#176;C for 2.5&#8197;h, which stimulates capsule reformation and catalyst re&#8208;encapsulation. Multiple on&#8208;off cycles were shown, with a clear relationship between product yield and light irradiation time. Encapsulation thus enables the coupling of light&#8208;responsiveness to catalysis in a manner that might be generalized to other catalysts and capsules.

         <title>Tailored Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Based Nanozymes for Enhanced Enzyme&#8208;Like Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work developed a novel metal&#8211;organic framework&#8208;based nanozyme that effectively blocks bacterial energy metabolism pathways through finely tuned catalytic center and substrate channel structures, demonstrating excellent antimicrobial properties and the potential to promote infected wound healing.







Abstract
The global crisis of bacterial infections is exacerbated by the escalating threat of microbial antibiotic resistance. Nanozymes promise to provide ingenious solutions. Here, we reported a homogeneous catalytic structure of Pt nanoclusters with finely tuned metal&#8211;organic framework (ZIF&#8208;8) channel structures for the treatment of infected wounds. Catalytic site normalization showed that the active site of the Pt aggregates structure with fine&#8208;tuned pore modifications structure had a catalytic capacity of 14.903&#215;105&#8197;min&#8722;1, which was 18.7&#8197;times higher than that of the Pt particles in monodisperse state in ZIF&#8208;8 (0.793&#215;105&#8197;min&#8722;1). In situ tests revealed that the change from homocleavage to heterocleavage of hydrogen peroxide at the interface of the nanozyme was one of the key reasons for the improvement of nanozyme activity. Density&#8208;functional theory and kinetic simulations of the reaction interface jointly determine the role of the catalytic center and the substrate channel together. Metabolomics analysis showed that the developed nanozyme, working in conjunction with reactive oxygen species, could effectively block energy metabolic pathways within bacteria, leading to spontaneous apoptosis and bacterial rupture. This pioneering study elucidates new ideas for the regulation of artificial enzyme activity and provides new perspectives for the development of efficient antibiotic substitutes.

         <title>Single crystalline, Non&#8208;stoichiometric Hydrogen&#8208;bonded Organic Frameworks Showing Versatile Fluorescence Depending on Composition Ratios and Distributions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the synthesis, characterization and photobehavior of single crystalline non&#8208;stoichiometric hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (NS&#8208;HOFs). NS&#8208;HOFs (BTNT&#8208;1) with various composition ratios were successfully obtained as single crystals from two analogue tetratopic carboxylic acids, possessing naphthalene and benzothiadiazole cores NTTA and BTTA, respectively. The heterogeneous distribution of the components was thoroughly confirmed by time&#8208;resolved fluorescence microscopy and focused synchrotron X&#8208;ray radiation techniques, for the first time. The versatile fluorescence of BTNT&#8208;1 behavior depends on the composition ratio and distribution of the component in the single crystals. We observed not only fluorescence bands with various colors such as purple, blue, green and white, depending on the composition ratio of both components in BTNT&#8208;1, but also different emission bands from a single crystal. Furthermore, we provide details on their emission lifetimes following the composition, emission color and targeted region on the crystal. These results demonstrate unique and versatile optical properties of carboxylic acid&#8208;based NS&#8208;HOFs and provide a concept of creating functional mixed porous materials capable of different and tunable optical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Engineered Through&#8208;Space Conjugation for Precise Control of Clusteroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clusteroluminogens (CLgens) represent an innovative class of nonconjugated luminophores that address the limitations of conventional &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules. Different from the through&#8208;bond conjugation mechanism in &#960;&#8208;conjugated luminophores, through&#8208;space conjugation (TSC) plays dominant roles in CLgens. However, precisely controlling TSC to customize the optical properties of CLgens remains a significant challenge. This work proposes a novel strategy of high pressure to engineer TSC within tetraphenylalkanes (TPAs)&#8208;based CLgens at molecular level. High&#8208;pressure exploration enables accurate manipulation of clusteroluminescence and elucidates the intrinsic structure&#8208;property relationships involved. Upon initial compression, the predominant molecular distortions marked by increased interfacial angles between benzene rings diminish TSC, resulting in anomalous hypochromatic shift in emission. Subsequently, considerable structural contraction enhances TSC and suppresses molecular motion, resulting in a pronouncedly enhanced and bathochromic&#8208;shifted emission. Notably, a series of TPAs&#8208;based CLgens exhibit intense white&#8208;light emission upon pressure release, attributed to irreversible structural distortion and destruction. This study not only advances the understanding of CLgens, but also underscores the crucial structural factors for effective TSC control, paving the way for establishing new photophysical theories for aggregate science.</dc:description>

         <title>Examining the Impact of 3D Multi&#8208;Arm Small Molecules on PM6:Y6 Blend Reveals the Key Requirements for Their Electronic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While the emergence of PM6:Y6 active layer re&#8208;energized the organic photovoltaic community, excessive aggregation of Y6 molecules induced by their strong intermolecular interactions has limited the performance of PM6:Y6&#8208;based organic solar cells (OSCs). Adding 3D multi&#8208;arm small&#8208;molecule acceptors is an effective strategy to inhibit such aggregation. However, to maximize OSC efficiency, these molecules should also contribute to the electronic processes. Here, by taking a benzotriazole&#8208;based 3D four&#8208;arm small molecule (i.e., SF&#8208;BTA1) as representative example, we combine molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations to examine the molecular&#8208;scale impact of 3D multi&#8208;arm small molecules on morphological characteristics (especially at the nanoscale) and electronic properties of PM6:Y6 blends. By considering the intermolecular packing distances, density, and patterns among PM6, Y6, and SF&#8208;BTA1 components, exciton transfer rates from SF&#8208;BTA1 to Y6 or PM6, charge transfer rates from Y6 or PM6 to SF&#8208;BTA1, electron/hole transfer rates among adjacent Y6/PM6 pairs, and radiative and non&#8208;radiative recombination processes, we draw a comprehensive picture that describes how 3D multi&#8208;arm small molecules improve morphological and electronic properties of PM6:Y6 blends and thus the OSC efficiency. Furthermore, successful rationalization of these aspects allows us to point out key requirements regarding the electronic properties of 3D multi&#8208;arm small molecules.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While the emergence of PM6:Y6 active layer re-energized the organic photovoltaic community, excessive aggregation of Y6 molecules induced by their strong intermolecular interactions has limited the performance of PM6:Y6-based organic solar cells (OSCs). Adding 3D multi-arm small-molecule acceptors is an effective strategy to inhibit such aggregation. However, to maximize OSC efficiency, these molecules should also contribute to the electronic processes. Here, by taking a benzotriazole-based 3D four-arm small molecule (i.e., SF-BTA1) as representative example, we combine molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations to examine the molecular-scale impact of 3D multi-arm small molecules on morphological characteristics (especially at the nanoscale) and electronic properties of PM6:Y6 blends. By considering the intermolecular packing distances, density, and patterns among PM6, Y6, and SF-BTA1 components, exciton transfer rates from SF-BTA1 to Y6 or PM6, charge transfer rates from Y6 or PM6 to SF-BTA1, electron/hole transfer rates among adjacent Y6/PM6 pairs, and radiative and non-radiative recombination processes, we draw a comprehensive picture that describes how 3D multi-arm small molecules improve morphological and electronic properties of PM6:Y6 blends and thus the OSC efficiency.

         <title>Dual Regulation of Sensitizers and Cluster Catalysts in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks to Boost H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic efficiency is closely correlated to visible&#8208;light absorption ability, electron transfer efficiency and catalytic center activity of photocatalysts, nevertheless, the concurrent management of these factors to improve photocatalytic efficiency remains underexplored. Herein, we proposed a sensitizer/catalyst dual regulation strategy on the polyoxometalate@Metal&#8722;Organic Framework (POM@MOF) molecular platform to construct highly efficient photocatalysts. Impressively, Ni&#8208;Sb9@UiO&#8208;Ir&#8208;C6, obtained by coupling strong sensitizing [Ir(coumarin 6)2(bpy)]+ with Ni&#8208;Sb9 POM with extremely exposed nickel site [NiO3(H2O)3], can drive H2 evolution with a turnover number of 326923, representing a record value among all the POM@MOF composite photocatalysts. This performance is over 34 times higher than that of the typical Ni4P2@UiO&#8208;Ir constructed from [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+ and Ni4P2 POM. systematical investigations revealed that dual regulation of sensitizing and catalytic centers endowed Ni&#8208;Sb9@UiO&#8208;Ir&#8208;C6 with strong visible&#8208;light absorption, efficient inter&#8208;component electron transfer and high catalytic activity to concurrently promote H2 evolution. This work opens up a new avenue to develop highly active POM@MOF photocatalysts by dual regulation of sensitizing/catalytic centers at the molecular level.</dc:description>

         <title>Locking up G&#8208;quadruplexes with light&#8208;triggered staples leads to increased topological, thermodynamic, and metabolic stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) are secondary, tetraplexed DNA structures abundant in non&#8208;coding regions of the genome, implicated in gene transcription processes and currently firmly recognised as important potential therapeutic targets. Given their affinity for human proteins, G4 structures are investigated as potential decoys and aptamers. However, G4s tend to adopt different conformations depending on the exact environmental conditions, and often only one displays the specifically desired biological activity. Their less intensively studied counterparts, the elusive tetraplexed intercalated&#8208;motifs (IMs) are typically unstable at neutral pH, hampering the investigation of their potential involvement in a biological context. We herein report on a photochemical method for &#8220;stapling&#8221; such tetraplexed&#8208;structures, to increase their stability, lock their topology and enhance their enzymatic resistance, while maintaining biological activity. The chemical structure and topology of the stapled Thrombin Binding Aptamer (TBA) was spectroscopically characterised and rationalised in silico. The method was then extended to other biologically relevant G4&#8208; and IM&#8208;prone sequences, hinting towards potential application of such stapled structures in a therapeutic context.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling the Multifunctional Mechanism of Fluoroethylene Carbonate in Enhancing High&#8208;Performance Room&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT Na&#8208;S) batteries has attracted growing attentions in large&#8208;scale energy storage technology, while the serious shuttle effect and interface side reaction limit its practical application. Despite fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) has been widely used as an electrolyte additive or co&#8208;solvent to facilitate the optimization of electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase in RT Na&#8208;S batteries, its crucial influence and mechanism have not been clearly understood. Herein, we deeply reveal the two&#8208;steps cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI) formation by using FEC as the exclusive electrolyte solvent. The results demonstrate that FEC participates in both rapid nucleophilic reaction and electrochemical decomposition on cathode, which can effectively in situ construct a unique "chocolate&#8208;cookie" shaped CEI consisted of NaF&#8208;rich double layers. This CEI eliminates the shuttle effect and ensures the solid&#8208;solid conversion of sulfur. Along with the stable F&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed on the Na anode, the RT Na&#8208;S battery delivers an impressive performance (456 mAh g&#8208;1 after 1000 cycles at 0.5 C) with almost 100% Coulombic efficiency. This significantly simplifies electrolyte design and provides valuable insights into the application of FEC in practical Na&#8208;S batteries</dc:description>

         <title>Counterions Determine if Metal&#8211;Organic Cages Convert SO2 to Sulfate or Reversibly Adsorb It</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The continuous emission of harmful gases into the atmosphere damages the environment, air quality, and public health worldwide. To mitigate their impact, materials that capture and chemically inactivate gases are required; however, integrating and precisely controlling both abilities within a single material remains challenging. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that switching between SO2&#8211;physisorption and chemisorption is possible for porous materials by using different counterions, as illustrated with a series of Pd6L8 Metal&#8208;Organic Cages (MOCs). Pd&#8208;MOCs bearing BF4&#8211;, PF6&#8211;, or SO42&#8211; expressed reversible adsorption (up to 3.6 mmol g&#8211;1), cyclability, and SO2/CO2 selectivity. NO3&#8211; promoted conversion of SO2 to sulfate, as corroborated with M6L8 cages built on Co(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II) ions. Noteworthy, the nitrate derivative of Pd6L8 captures 6.0 mmol g&#8211;1 of SO2, cleanly transforms it to SO42&#8211; within its cavity in 94% yield at room temperature, it is quantitatively regenerated, and tolerates humid SO2; such qualities are unprecedented for SO2 adsorbents. The deliberate use of counterions for modulating adsorption could be applied to charged MOFs, COFs, or POCs, potentially leading to the development of new reactivity or catalysis pathways for advanced applications against contaminant gases.</dc:description>

         <title>Subtle Modifications in Interface Configurations of Iron/Cobalt Phthalocyanine&#8208;based Electrocatalysts Determine Molecular CO2 Reduction Activities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strain engineering has emerged as a powerful approach in steering the material properties. However, the improved catalytic activity remains poorly understood. Here we report that subtle changes in molecular configurations can profoundly affect, conducively or adversely, the catalytic selectivity and product turnover frequencies (TOFs) of CO2RR. Specifically, introducing molecular curvature in cobalt tetraaminophthalocyanine improves the multielectron CO2RR activity by favorable *CO hydrogenation, attaining methanol Faradaic efficiency up to 52%. In stark contrast, strained iron phthalocyanine exacerbates *CO poisoning, leading to a decreased TOFCO by over 50% at &#8208;0.5 VRHE and a rapid current decay. The uniform dispersion is crucial for optimizing electron transfer, while activity is distinctly sensitive to local atomic environment around the active sites. Specifically, local strain either enhances binding to intermediates or poisons the catalytic sites. Our comprehensive analysis elucidates the intricate relationship between molecular structure and CO2RR activities, offering insights into designing efficient heterogeneous molecular interfaces.</dc:description>

Herein, we synthesize two highly crystalline and robust polyimide covalent organic frameworks (COFs) through a solvent&#8208;free flux synthesis approach with benzoic acid as a flux and catalyst. The as&#8208;synthesized COFs possess enriched redox&#8208;active sites for proton storage and intrinsic Grotthuss proton conduction, rendering them ideal candidates for proton electrode materials. The optimal COF electrodes achieve a high specific capacity of 180 mAh/g at 0.1 A/g, among the highest COF&#8208;based proton batteries, and exhibit an outstanding rate capability of up to 100 A/g and long&#8208;term cycling stability with capacity retention of 99% after 5000 cycles at 5 A/g. The assembled full cells deliver a specific capacity of 150 mAh/g at 0.2 A/g with a maximum energy density of 72 Wh/kg and a maximum supercapacitor&#8208;level power density of 64 kW/kg, surpassing all reported COF&#8208;based systems. This work paves a new avenue for the design of electrode materials for aqueous proton batteries with high energy density, power density, rate capability and long&#8208;term cycling stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Visualization and Quantification of Single&#8208;Base m6A Methylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N 6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) has emerged as the most prevalent form of RNA modification found across various RNA classes. The detection and quantification of m6A RNA modifications under various physiological conditions are crucial for elucidating disease mechanisms and identifying potential therapeutic targets. However, visualizing intracellular m6A modifications at single&#8208;nucleotide resolution remains a significant challenge. Existing methods based on high&#8208;throughput sequencing or in vitro assays are not suitable for in situ m6A RNA imaging. In this work, we introduce the TadA8.20&#8208;assisted N6&#8208;methyladenosine RNA imaging at single&#8208;nucleotide resolution (TARS) method for precise visualization and quantification of both A and m6A forms at specific RNA sites within single cells. Validation studies using TARS on MALAT1 lncRNA in HeLa cells and CCND1 mRNA in breast cancer cell lines demonstrated its high specificity and efficiency in mapping and quantifying m6A modifications at single&#8208;nucleotide resolution. TARS represents a novel tool that advances m6A RNA modification research by offering accurate and detailed insights into m6A modifications at the single&#8208;nucleotide level.</dc:description>

         <title>A Chlorine&#8208;Resistant Self&#8208;Doped Nanocarbon Catalyst for Boosting Hydrogen Peroxide Synthesis in Seawater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing seawater&#8208;compatible hydrogen peroxide electroproduction technologies is crucial for advancing marine resource utilization in coastal regions. However, designing efficient and highly stable non&#8208;noble metal catalysts for two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction in seawater environment remains a challenging task due to the corrosive and toxic nature of chloride ions (Cl&#8208;). Herein, we present, for the first time, a novel nitrogen and oxygen self&#8208;doped defect&#8208;rich nanocarbon (NO&#8208;DC700) catalyst, derived from silk fiber, which addresses these challenges with low toxicity, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and high adaptability. The obtained NO&#8208;DC700 catalyst demonstrates an impressive H2O2 production rate of up to 4997 mg L&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, a high Faradaic efficiency of 96.5%, and produces 4.3 wt.% H2O2 after 20 hours of stable operation, placing it among the highest&#8208;performing catalysts reported in neutral electrolytes. Theoretical calculations reveal that NO&#8208;DC700's superior 2e&#8208; ORR performance is due to the synergistic effect of graphitic nitrogen and C&#8208;OH, which inhibits Cl&#8208; adsorption and promotes *OOH adsorption. Additionally, integrating 2e&#8208; ORR with Fenton&#8208;like technology enables rapid degradation of organic pollutants and effective inactivation of seawater algae, offering significant potential for mitigating coastal eutrophication and red tide pollution. This work provides valuable insights into H2O2 electrosynthesis in seawater solution and promises advancements in ocean&#8208;energy applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Here we report a metal&#8208; and light&#8208;free decarboxylative functionalization approach enabled by reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) analogues. The efficient and operationally simple approach, conducted in 5 minutes from in&#8208;situ preparation of aryliodine (III) dicarboxylates under open&#8208;air and ambient conditions, enables diverse bond formation and exhibits a broad substrate scope of over 70 examples. Late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug molecules and natural products further demonstrates the synthetic utility of this method. Combined experimental and computational studies elucidate the mechanistic pathway. These transformations streamline the synthesis of sp3 carbon&#8208;enriched compounds, adding a new dimension to classical decarboxylative reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>A Helical Tubular Dyad of [9]Cycloparaphenylene: Synthesis, Chiroptical Properties and Post&#8208;functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bottom&#8208;up synthesis of discrete tubular molecules that mimic the structural features of carbon nanotubes has been a long&#8208;standing pursuit for synthetic chemists. As the shortest segments of armchair&#8208;type carbon nanotubes, cycloparaphenylenes are regarded as ideal macrocyclic building blocks for achieving this goal. Here we report the synthesis of a helical tubular molecule featuring three diyne linkers between two site&#8208;specifically functionalized [9]cycloparaphenylene. Its C3&#8208;symmetrical, radially conjugated structure and solid&#8208;state packing have been elucidated by spectroscopic and crystallographic characterizations. Notably, the resolved enantiomers display a circularly polarized luminescence brightness value of 1.47 &#215; 103 M&#8211;1 cm&#8211;1, which is among the highest values for chiral organic molecules. Furthermore, the diyne&#8208;linked molecule could be directly converted into a thiophene&#8208;linked helical molecule, demonstrating the post&#8208;functionalization approach for the construction of chiral tubular molecules from cycloparaphenylenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Dicyanocarbene&#8208;Induced Metal&#8208;Free Efficient Quinoidization for the Development of Fused N&#8208;Type Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dicyanomethylene&#8208;terminated quinoidal materials are promising n&#8208;type organic semiconductors featuring excellent electron mobilities and air stability. Traditional synthetic methods of these materials such as Takahashi reaction, require the use of expensive palladium catalyst and halogenated substrates. However, for electron&#8208;rich fused aromatic compounds, the poor stability after halogenation renders their halogenated derivatives unsuitable as reaction precursors. To address this issue, we present a new metal&#8208;free synthetic approach using 2&#8208;(dimethylsulfaneylidene)malononitrile as the quinoidization reagent, which is successfully applied to various electron&#8208;rich fused aromatic compounds, leading to the corresponding quinoidal compounds with high yields up to 94%. We proposed the reaction mechanism, and investigated the physical properties of four fused quinoidal materials based on highly electron&#8208;rich fused aromatic compounds, which are scarce to be synthesized by the traditional method. Furthermore, these fused quinoidal materials were utilized in field&#8208;effect transistors, achieving high electron mobilities up to 1.33 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. We provide an effective synthetic approach to expand the library of high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule semiconductors.</dc:description>

         <title>Bridging Electrolyte Bulk and Interfacial Chemistry: Dynamic Protective Strategy Enable Ultra&#8208;Long Lifespan Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The main bottleneck of rechargeable aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs) is their limited cycle lifespans stemming from the unhealthy electrolyte bulk and fragile interface, especially in the absence of dynamic protection mechanism between them. To overcome this limitation, benefitting from their synergistic physical and chemical properties, chitin nanocrystals (ChNCs) are employed as superior colloid electrolyte to bridge electrolyte bulk and interfacial chemistry for ultra&#8208;long lifespan AZBs. This unique strategy not only enables continuous optimization of the electrolyte bulk and interfacial chemistry within the battery but also facilitates self&#8208;repairing of mechanical damage both internally and externally, thereby achieving comprehensive, persistent, and dynamic protection. As a result, the modified Zinc (Zn) symmetric cells present high Zn plating/stripping coulombic efficiencies of 97.71% ~ 99.81% from 5 to 100 mA cm&#8208;2, and remarkably service lifespan up to 8,200 h (more than 11 months). Additionally, the Zn//MnO2 full cell exhibits a high capacity retention of 70.1% after 3,000 cycles at 5 A g&#8208;1. This dynamic protective strategy to challenge aqueous Zn chemistry may open up a new avenue for building better AZBs and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Can Deep Learning Search for Exceptional Chiroptical Properties? The Halogenated [6]Helicene Case</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we have focused on one of the most important chiral motifs, [6]helicene, and we have predicted the effect of halogenation on its chiroptical properties using Deep Learning. We have developed three machine learning models, which allow us to evaluate millions of compounds and learn the reasons that favor some substitutions. With the knowledge gained, we synthesized the most favored candidates, exhibiting the predicted properties.







Abstract
The relationship between chemical structure and chiroptical properties is not always clearly understood. Nowadays, efforts to develop new systems with enhanced optical properties follow the trial&#8208;error method. A large number of data would allow us to obtain more robust conclusions and guide research toward molecules with practical applications. In this sense, in this work we predict the chiroptical properties of millions of halogenated [6]helicenes in terms of the rotatory strength (R). We have used DFT calculations to randomly create derivatives including from 1 to 16 halogen atoms, that were then used as a data set to train different deep neural network models. These models allow us to i) predict the Rmax for any halogenated [6]helicene with a very low computational cost, and ii) to understand the physical reasons that favour some substitutions over others. Finally, we synthesized derivatives with higher predicted Rmax obtaining excellent correlation among the values obtained experimentally and the predicted ones.

         <title>Surface Reaction Induced Compressive Strain for Stable Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface reaction strategy is applied to regulate compressive strain at CsPbI3 surface. The synergistic effect of chemical bonding and strain regulation suppresses interface recombination and phase transition, leading to enhanced PCE of 21.0&#8201;% and promising operational stability with T99 over 2000&#8197;h at MPP tracking which represents one of the most stable wide band gap PSCs.







Abstract
Cesium&#8208;based inorganic perovskites have emerged as promising light&#8208;harvesting materials for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to their promising thermal&#8208; and photo&#8208;stability. However, obstacles to commercialization remain regarding their phase instability. In this work, we report a facile and effective strategy to regulate the surface compressive strain via in situ surface reaction to stabilize CsPbI3 perovskite. The use of a chelating ligand with a molecular configuration closely matching the integer multiples of the unit cell lattice parameters of CsPbI3 induces compressive strain at the surface of CsPbI3. The chemical bonding and strain modulation synergistically not only passivate film defects, but also inhibit perovskite phase degradation, thus significantly improving the intrinsic stability of inorganic perovskite. Consequently, enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.0&#8201;% and 18.6&#8201;% were respectively achieved in 0.16&#8208;cm2 lab&#8208;scale devices and 25.3&#8208;cm2 solar modules. Further, surface reaction enables PSCs with enhanced thermal and operational stability; these devices retain over 95&#8201;% of their initial PCE after damp&#8208;heat tests (i.e., in 85&#8201;&#176;C and 85&#8201;% R.&#8197;H. air) for 2000&#8197;h, and remain 99&#8201;% of their initial PCE after operating for 2000&#8197;h, representing one of the most stable inorganic PSCs reported so far.

         <title>Indole N&#8208;Linked Hydroperoxyl Adduct of Protein&#8208;Derived Cofactor Modulating Catalase&#8208;Peroxidase Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalase&#8208;peroxidase (KatG) neutralizes hydrogen peroxide during infection. Mycobacterium tuberculosis KatG from cells grown at ambient temperature contains an indole nitrogen&#8208;linked hydroperoxyl adduct, MYW&#8208;OOH (golden color). MYW&#8208;OOH transiently inhibits catalase activity, presenting a unique off switch. Exposure to peroxide or increased temperature converts MYW&#8208;OOH to MYW (blue color) and restores KatG's detoxifying ability.







Abstract
Bifunctional catalase&#8208;peroxidase (KatG) features a posttranslational methionine&#8208;tyrosine&#8208;tryptophan (MYW) crosslinked cofactor crucial for its catalase function, enabling pathogens to neutralize hydrogen peroxide during infection. We discovered the presence of indole nitrogen&#8208;linked hydroperoxyl adduct (MYW&#8208;OOH) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis KatG in the solution state under ambient conditions, suggesting its natural occurrence. By isolating predominantly MYW&#8208;OOH&#8208;containing KatG protein, we investigated the chemical stability and functional impact of MYW&#8208;OOH. We discovered that MYW&#8208;OOH inhibits catalase activity, presenting a unique temporary lock. Exposure to peroxide or increased temperature removes the hydroperoxyl adduct from the protein cofactor, converting MYW&#8208;OOH to MYW and restoring the detoxifying ability of the enzyme against hydrogen peroxide. Thus, the N&#8208;linked hydroperoxyl group is releasable. KatG with MYW&#8208;OOH represents a catalase dormant, but primed, state of the enzyme. These findings provide insight into chemical strategies targeting the bifunctional enzyme KatG in pathogens, highlighting the role of N&#8208;linked hydroperoxyl modifications in enzymatic function.

&lt;p&gt;Catalase-peroxidase (KatG) neutralizes hydrogen peroxide during infection. &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; KatG from cells grown at ambient temperature contains an indole nitrogen-linked hydroperoxyl adduct, MYW-OOH (golden color). MYW-OOH transiently inhibits catalase activity, presenting a unique off switch. Exposure to peroxide or increased temperature converts MYW-OOH to MYW (blue color) and restores KatG's detoxifying ability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bifunctional catalase-peroxidase (KatG) features a posttranslational methionine-tyrosine-tryptophan (MYW) crosslinked cofactor crucial for its catalase function, enabling pathogens to neutralize hydrogen peroxide during infection. We discovered the presence of indole nitrogen-linked hydroperoxyl adduct (MYW-OOH) in &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; KatG in the solution state under ambient conditions, suggesting its natural occurrence. By isolating predominantly MYW-OOH-containing KatG protein, we investigated the chemical stability and functional impact of MYW-OOH. We discovered that MYW-OOH inhibits catalase activity, presenting a unique temporary lock. Exposure to peroxide or increased temperature removes the hydroperoxyl adduct from the protein cofactor, converting MYW-OOH to MYW and restoring the detoxifying ability of the enzyme against hydrogen peroxide. Thus, the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-linked hydroperoxyl group is releasable. KatG with MYW-OOH represents a catalase dormant, but primed, state of the enzyme. These findings provide insight into chemical strategies targeting the bifunctional enzyme KatG in pathogens, highlighting the role of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-linked hydroperoxyl modifications in enzymatic function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Loading Dyes into Chiral Cd/Zn&#8208;Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Full&#8208;Color Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sizes of chiral MOFs can be controlled from sub&#8208;20&#8197;&#956;m to over 7&#8197;mm by tuning the types and additional amounts of organic dyes. The full&#8208;color circularly polarized luminescence MOFs are synthesized by different dyes encapsulation, which are further assembled into a white CPL light&#8208;emitting diode.







Abstract
Host&#8208;guest chemistry of chiral metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) has endowed them with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), it is still limited for MOFs to systematically tune full&#8208;color CPL emissions and sizes. This work directionally assembles the chiral ligands, metal sites and organic dyes to prepare a series of crystalline enantiomeric D/L&#8208;Cd/Zn&#8208;n MOFs (n=1~5, representing the adding amount of dyes), where D/L&#8208;Cd/Zn with the formula of Cd2(D/L&#8211;Cam)2(TPyPE) and Zn2(D/L&#8211;Cam)2(TPyPE) (D/L&#8208;Cam=D/L&#8208;camphoric acid, TPyPE=4,4&#8217;,4&#8217;&#8217;,4&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;(1,2&#8208;henediidenetetra&#8208;4,1&#8208;phenylene)tetrakis[pyridine]) were used as the chiral platforms. The framework&#8208;dye&#8208;enabled emission and through&#8208;space chirality transfer facilitate D/L&#8208;Cd/Zn&#8208;n bright full&#8208;color CPL activity. The ideal yellow CPL of D&#8208;Cd&#8208;5 and D&#8208;Zn&#8208;4, with |glum| as 4.9&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;3 and 1.3&#215;10&#8722;3 and relatively high photoluminescence quantum yield of 40.79&#8201;% and 45.40&#8201;%, are further assembled into a white CPL light&#8208;emitting diode. The crystal sizes of D/L&#8208;Cd/Zn&#8208;n were found to be strongly correlated to the types and additional amounts of organic dyes, that the positive organic dyes allow for the preparation of &gt;&#8201;7&#8197;mm bulks and negative dyes account for sub&#8208;20&#8197;&#956;m particles. This work opens a new avenue to fabricate full&#8208;color emissive CPL composites and provides a potentially universal method for controlling the size of optical platforms.

         <title>DNA Origami Vesicle Sensors with Triggered Single&#8208;Molecule Cargo Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a DNA origami&#8208;based biosensor for precise lipid vesicle detection and cargo delivery using single&#8208;molecule Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET). The hydrophobic ATTO647N&#8208;modified single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA) leash on the sensor detects vesicle binding via FRET changes and delivers molecular cargo through triggered strand displacement reaction. This platform offers innovative applications in biosensing and controllable stoichiometric loading of vesicles.







Abstract
Interacting with living systems typically involves the ability to address lipid membranes of cellular systems. The first step of interaction of a nanorobot with a cell will thus be the detection of binding to a lipid membrane. Utilizing DNA origami, we engineered a biosensor with single&#8208;molecule Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) as transduction mechanism for precise lipid vesicle detection and cargo delivery. The system hinges on a hydrophobic ATTO647N modified single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA) leash, protruding from a DNA origami nanostructure. In a vesicle&#8208;free environment, the ssDNA coils, ensuring high FRET efficiency. Upon vesicle binding to cholesterol anchors on the DNA origami, hydrophobic ATTO647N induces the ssDNA to stretch towards the lipid bilayer, reducing FRET efficiency. As the next step, the sensing strand serves as molecular cargo that can be transferred to the vesicle through a triggered strand displacement reaction. Depending on the number of cholesterols on the displacer strands, we either induce a diffusive release of the fluorescent load towards neighboring vesicles or a stoichiometric release of a single cargo&#8208;unit to the vesicle on the nanosensor. Ultimately, our multi&#8208;functional liposome interaction and detection platform opens up pathways for innovative biosensing applications and stoichiometric loading of vesicles with single&#8208;molecule control.

         <title>Enantioconvergent Cross&#8208;Nucleophile Coupling: Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Deborylative Cyanation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a general deborylative cyanation protocol representative of an enantioconvergent cross&#8208;nucleophile coupling platform. Mechanistic study suggests the formation of prochiral alkyl radicals via aniline&#8208;assisted single&#8208;electron activation of organoboron species. Electronic structure analysis of the reactive CuII(CN)2 complex indicates a significant amount of ligand&#8208;based radical density.







Abstract
Organoboron compounds are widely utilized in organic synthesis for their diverse reactivity, modular preparation, and stability compared to other classes of organometallic reagents. While organoboron species are commonly employed as nucleophiles in cross&#8208;coupling reactions, their potential as racemic building blocks in enantioconvergent transformations remains largely untapped. Herein, we demonstrate the direct utilization of alkylboronic pinacol esters in intermolecular enantioconvergent transformations. Specifically, this work describes the development and mechanistic study of an enantioconvergent deborylative cyanation enabled by Cu catalysis. This method imparts a high degree of enantioselectivity and tolerates a wide range of common functional groups and heterocycles. The reaction is proposed to proceed through a radical&#8208;relay mechanism. Aniline&#8208;assisted homolysis of the carbon&#8211;boron bond results in prochiral alkyl radicals that are functionalized by in situ generated Cu(II)(CN)2 species in an enantioselective fashion. The Cu(II)(CN)2 intermediate was characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, and its electronic structure was probed using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Computational studies were carried out to corroborate the proposed radical&#8208;relay mechanism.

         <title>Chemical Recording of Pump&#8208;Specific Drug Efflux in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the bioorthogonal reporter inhibiting efflux (BRIEF) strategy, the drug of interest competes with the efflux of BEP through specific pumps, resulting in the accumulation of BEP within the cells. The elevated intracellular levels of BEP induced by the drug contribute to a heightened extent of protein labeling. We developed two BEPs based on per&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated unnatural monosaccharide labeling and photocatalytic proximity labeling to record drug efflux by multidrug resistance proteins and p&#8208;glycoprotein, respectively.







Abstract
Drug efflux&#8212;a process primarily facilitated by efflux pumps such as multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs)&#8212;plays a pivotal role in cellular resistance to chemotherapies. Conventional approaches to assess drug efflux are predominantly conducted in vitro and often lack pump specificity. Here we report the bioorthogonal reporter inhibiting efflux (BRIEF) strategy, which enables the recording of pump&#8208;specific drug efflux in living cells. In BRIEF, a specific substrate is engineered as a bioorthogonal efflux probe (BEP) for specific pumps. The cellular concentration and protein labeling level of the probe can be augmented when the test drug is transported by the same pumps. Serendipitously, we discovered that per&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated unnatural monosaccharides, initially designed for metabolic glycan labeling, are exported by some MRPs. Using Ac4GlcNAl as a BEP, we studied the structure&#8208;efflux relationship of flavonoids and identified small molecules, including tannic acid, cholesterol and gallic acid, as novel MRP substrates in high&#8208;throughput screening. Tannic acid, known for anti&#8208;tumor and anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 properties, showed increased efficacy upon MRP inhibition. Additionally, BRIEF was adapted to assess p&#8208;glycoprotein&#8208;mediated efflux using Rhodamine&#8197;123 as a BEP, leveraging its light&#8208;activatable proximity labeling ability.

&lt;p&gt;In the bioorthogonal reporter inhibiting efflux (BRIEF) strategy, the drug of interest competes with the efflux of BEP through specific pumps, resulting in the accumulation of BEP within the cells. The elevated intracellular levels of BEP induced by the drug contribute to a heightened extent of protein labeling. We developed two BEPs based on per-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-acetylated unnatural monosaccharide labeling and photocatalytic proximity labeling to record drug efflux by multidrug resistance proteins and p-glycoprotein, respectively.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drug efflux&#8212;a process primarily facilitated by efflux pumps such as multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs)&#8212;plays a pivotal role in cellular resistance to chemotherapies. Conventional approaches to assess drug efflux are predominantly conducted in vitro and often lack pump specificity. Here we report the bioorthogonal reporter inhibiting efflux (BRIEF) strategy, which enables the recording of pump-specific drug efflux in living cells. In BRIEF, a specific substrate is engineered as a bioorthogonal efflux probe (BEP) for specific pumps. The cellular concentration and protein labeling level of the probe can be augmented when the test drug is transported by the same pumps. Serendipitously, we discovered that per-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-acetylated unnatural monosaccharides, initially designed for metabolic glycan labeling, are exported by some MRPs. Using Ac&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;GlcNAl as a BEP, we studied the structure-efflux relationship of flavonoids and identified small molecules, including tannic acid, cholesterol and gallic acid, as novel MRP substrates in high-throughput screening. Tannic acid, known for anti-tumor and anti-SARS-CoV-2 properties, showed increased efficacy upon MRP inhibition. Additionally, BRIEF was adapted to assess p-glycoprotein-mediated efflux using Rhodamine&#8197;123 as a BEP, leveraging its light-activatable proximity labeling ability. BRIEF provides a versatile approach to investigate drug efflux and enhance chemotherapy strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Narrow Alkane Product Distribution in Polyethylene Waste Hydrocracking by Zeolite Micro&#8208;Mesopore Diffusion Optimization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing zeolite micro&#8208;mesopore diffusion optimization, this study engineers a bifunctional catalytic system that achieves 94.0&#8201;% conversion of plastic waste into liquid alkanes, with 84.8&#8201;% in the C5&#8722;C7 range, significantly enhancing catalytic efficiency and selectivity for upcycling of polymers into high&#8208;value fuels.







Abstract
Plastic pollution poses a pressing environmental challenge in modern society. Chemical catalytic conversion has emerged as a promising solution for upgrading waste plastics into valuable liquid alkanes and other high value products. However, the current methods yield mixed products with a wide carbon distribution. To address this challenge, we present a bifunctional catalytic system consisting of &#946; zeolite mixed hierarchical Pt@Hie&#8208;TS&#8208;1, designed for the conversion of low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE) into liquid alkanes. This system achieves a 94.0&#8201;% yield of liquid alkane, with 84.8&#8201;% of C5&#8722;C7 light alkanes. Combined with in situ FTIR and molecular dynamics simulation, the shape&#8208;selective mechanisms is elucidated, which ensures that only olefins of the appropriate size can diffuse to the encapsulated Pt sites within the zeolite for hydrogenation, resulting in an ultra&#8208;narrow product distribution. Furthermore, by optimizing the micro&#8208;mesopores of Pt@Hie&#8208;TS&#8208;1, the scaling relationship between the pore structure and the conversion/selectivity is identified. The rapid diffusion of olefins within these micro&#8208;mesopores significantly enhances the catalytic efficiency. Our findings contribute to the design of efficient catalysts for plastic waste valorization.

         <title>Diaminonaphthalene Boronic Acid (DANBA): New Approach for Peroxynitrite Sensing Site</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diaminonaphthalene (DAN)&#8208;protected boronic acid (DANBA) proved to be a universal and highly selective recognition group for ONOO&#8722; over H2O2 and other reactive oxygen species, overcoming the long&#8208;standing issues of aryl&#8208;boronic acid&#8208;based probes. DANBA can be combined with diverse hydroxyl&#8208;containing fluorophores to obtain ONOO&#8722; sensing probes with different spectral emissions. A DANBA and malononitrile fluorophore&#8208;based probe detected subtle changes in the ONOO&#8722; levels of mouse brains with Parkinson's disease.







Abstract
Selective detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is vital for studying their role in brain diseases. Fluorescence probes can distinguish ONOO&#8722; species from other ROS; however, their selectivity toward ONOO&#8722; species depends on the ONOO&#8722; recognition group. Aryl&#8208;boronic acids and esters, which are common ONOO&#8722; recognition groups, are not selective for ONOO&#8722; over H2O2. In this study, we developed a diaminonaphthalene (DAN)&#8208;protected boronic acid as a new ONOO&#8722; recognition group that selectively reacts with ONOO&#8722; over H2O2 and other ROS. Three DAN&#8208;protected boronic acid (DANBA)&#8208;based fluorophores that emit fluorescence over visible to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) regions, Cou&#8208;BN, BVP&#8208;BN, and HDM&#8208;BN, and their aryl&#8208;boronic acid&#8208;based counterparts (Cou&#8208;BO, BVP&#8208;BO, and HDM&#8208;BO), were developed. The DANBA&#8208;based probes exhibited enhanced selectivity toward ONOO&#8722; over that of their control group, as well as universality in solution assays and in vitro experiments with PC12 cells. The NIR&#8208;emissive HDM&#8208;BN was optimized to delineate in vivo ONOO&#8722; levels in mouse brains with Parkinson's disease. This DAN&#8208;protected boronic acid belongs to a new generation of recognition groups for developing ONOO&#8722; probes, and this strategy could be extended to other common hydroxyl&#8208;containing dyes to detect ONOO&#8722; levels in complex biological systems and processes.

         <title>Interfacial Engineering of Polymer Membranes with Intrinsic Microporosity for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) containing hydrophilic Tr&#246;ger's base groups were coated as ultrathin selective membranes on zinc metal anodes to regulate the ion transport and electrochemical reactions at interfaces. The PIM membranes regulate the zinc ion transport and effectively mitigate zinc dendrite growth, as well as reduce corrosive side reactions, leading to safe and stable zinc metal batteries.







Abstract
Metallic zinc has emerged as a promising anode material for high&#8208;energy battery systems due to its high theoretical capacity (820&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), low redox potential for two&#8208;electron reactions, cost&#8208;effectiveness and inherent safety. However, current zinc metal batteries face challenges in low coulombic efficiency and limited longevity due to uncontrollable dendrite growth, the corrosive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and decomposition of the aqueous ZnSO4 electrolyte. Here, we report an interfacial&#8208;engineering approach to mitigate dendrite growth and reduce corrosive reactions through the design of ultrathin selective membranes coated on the zinc anodes. The submicron&#8208;thick membranes derived from polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs), featuring pores with tunable interconnectivity, facilitate regulated transport of Zn2+&#8208;ions, thereby promoting a uniform plating/stripping process. Benefiting from the protection by PIM membranes, zinc symmetric cells deliver a stable cycling performance over 1500&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA/cm2 with a capacity of 0.5&#8197;mAh while full cells with NaMnO2 cathode operate stably at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 300&#8197;cycles without capacity decay. Our work represents a new strategy of preparing multi&#8208;functional membranes that can advance the development of safe and stable zinc metal batteries.

         <title>Self&#8208;Organized Patterns in Non&#8208;Reciprocal Active Droplet Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binary mixtures of droplets exhibiting non&#8208;reciprocal active interactions self&#8208;organize into dynamic patterns upon tuning the number ratio and size ratio of the two populations and the surfactant composition. A minimal mathematical model recapitulates the experimentally observed patterns. The chemical organizing principles governing the binary droplet system are extendable to multicomponent active droplet mixtures.







Abstract
Non&#8208;equilibrium patterns are widespread in nature and often arise from the self&#8208;organization of constituents through nonreciprocal chemotactic interactions. In this study, we demonstrate how active oil&#8208;in&#8208;water droplet mixtures with predator&#8208;prey interactions can result in a variety of self&#8208;organized patterns. By manipulating physical parameters, the droplet diameter ratio and number ratio, we identify distinct classes of patterns within a binary droplet system, rationalize the pattern formation, and quantify motilities. Experimental results are recapitulated in numerical simulations using a minimal computational model that solely incorporates chemotactic interactions and steric repulsion among the constituents.

     alt="Self-Organized Patterns in Non-Reciprocal Active Droplet Systems"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Binary mixtures of droplets exhibiting non-reciprocal active interactions self-organize into dynamic patterns upon tuning the number ratio and size ratio of the two populations and the surfactant composition. A minimal mathematical model recapitulates the experimentally observed patterns. The chemical organizing principles governing the binary droplet system are extendable to multicomponent active droplet mixtures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-equilibrium patterns are widespread in nature and often arise from the self-organization of constituents through nonreciprocal chemotactic interactions. In this study, we demonstrate how active oil-in-water droplet mixtures with predator-prey interactions can result in a variety of self-organized patterns. By manipulating physical parameters, the droplet diameter ratio and number ratio, we identify distinct classes of patterns within a binary droplet system, rationalize the pattern formation, and quantify motilities. Experimental results are recapitulated in numerical simulations using a minimal computational model that solely incorporates chemotactic interactions and steric repulsion among the constituents. The time evolution of the patterns is investigated and chemically explained. We also investigate how patterns vary with differing interaction strength by altering surfactant composition. Leveraging insights from the binary droplet system, the framework is extended to a ternary droplet mixture composed of multiple chasing droplet pairs to create chemically directed hierarchical organization. Our findings demonstrate how rationalizable, self-organized patterns can be programmed in a chemically minimal system and provide the basis for exploration of emergent organization and higher order complexity in active colloids.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Cytochrome P450 TxtE Model System with Mechanistic and Theoretical Evidence for a Heme Peroxynitrite Active Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient modelling of the economically impactful enzyme, TxtE, has been probed, in which indole (tryptophan mimic) nitration was observed by a putative heme&#8208;peroxynitrite intermediate, resembling one of the prime enzymatic mechanistic proposals. Experimental and theoretical exploration of the mechanism reveal a unique reaction landscape dictated by NO2 radical species.







Abstract
The cytochrome P450 homolog, TxtE, efficiently catalyzes the direct and regioselective aromatic nitration of the indolyl moiety of L&#8208;tryptophan to 4&#8208;nitro&#8208;L&#8208;tryptophan, using nitric oxide (NO) and dioxygen (O2) as co&#8208;substrates. Pathways for such direct and selective nitration of heteroaromatic motifs present platforms for engineering new nitration biocatalysts for pharmacologically beneficial targets, among a medley of other pivotal industrial applications. Precise mechanistic details concerning this pathway are only weakly understood, albeit a heme iron(III)&#8208;peroxynitrite active species has been postulated. To shed light on this unique reaction landscape, we investigated the indole nitration pathway of a series of biomimetic ferric heme superoxide mimics, [(Por)FeIII(O2&#8722;&#8901;)], in the presence of NO. Therein, our model systems gave rise to three distinct nitroindole products, including 4&#8208;nitroindole, the product analogous to that obtained with TxtE. Moreover, 15N and 18O isotope labeling studies, along with meticulously designed control experiments lend credence to a heme peroxynitrite active nitrating agent, drawing close similarities to the tryptophan nitration mechanism of TxtE. All organic and inorganic reaction components have been fully characterized using spectroscopic methods. Theoretical investigation into several mechanistic possibilities deem a unique indolyl radical based reaction pathway as the most energetically favorable, products of which, are in excellent agreement with experimental findings.

         <title>Accessing Therapeutically&#8208;Relevant Multifunctional Antisense Oligonucleotide Conjugates Using Native Chemical Ligation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide and carbohydrate&#8208;antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) conjugates containing clinically&#8208;relevant phosphorothioate (PS) and locked&#8208;nucleic acid (LNA) backbone modifications are efficiently prepared using native chemical ligation. Chemoselective post&#8208;ligation modification of ASO conjugates is accomplished using radical desulfurization and cysteine modification chemistry to deliver valuable multifunctional constructs.







Abstract
Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapies hold significant promise in the realm of molecular medicine. By precisely targeting RNA molecules, ASOs offer an approach to modulate gene expression and protein production, making them valuable tools for treating a wide range of genetic and acquired diseases. As the precise intracellular targeting and delivery of ASOs is challenging, strategies for preparing ASO&#8208;ligand conjugates are in exceedingly high demand. This work leverages the utility of native chemical ligation to conjugate ASOs with therapeutically relevant chemical modifications including locked nucleic acids and phosphorothioate backbone modifications to peptides and sugars via a stable amide linkage. A suite of post&#8208;ligation functionalizations through modification of the cysteine ligation handle are highlighted, including chemoselective radical desulfurization, lipidation, and alkylation with a range of valuable handles (e.g. alkyne, biotin, and radionuclide chelating ligands), affording multifunctional constructs for further applications in biology and medicine. Application of the methodology to a clinically&#8208;relevant triantennary&#8208;GalNAc ASO conjugate and validation of its binding and functional activity underpins the applicability of the technique to oligonucleotide&#8208;based therapeutics.

         <title>Dynamic Nuclear Polarization with Conductive Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conductive polymers such as polyaniline are promising polarizing agents for dynamic nuclear polarization. They are tunable, can be functionalized, and their unpaired electrons can be hyperpolarized by chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity. We show solid&#8208;state dynamic nuclear polarization of polyaniline at liquid helium temperatures with an intriguing mechanism crossover as radical concentration is increased.







Abstract
The low sensitivity of liquid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) can be overcome by hyperpolarizing nuclear spins by dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (dDNP). It consists of transferring the near&#8208;unity polarization of unpaired electron spins of stable radicals to the nuclear spins of interest at liquid helium temperatures, below 2&#8197;K, before melting the sample in view of hyperpolarized liquid&#8208;state magnetic resonance experiments. Reaching such a temperature is challenging and requires complex instrumentation, which impedes the deployment of dDNP. Here, we propose organic conductive polymers such as polyaniline (PANI) as a new class of polarizing matrices and report 1H polarizations of up to 5&#8201;%. We also show that 13C spins of a host solution impregnated in porous conductive polymers can be hyperpolarized by relayed DNP. Such conductive polymers can be synthesized as chiral and display current induced spin selectivity leading to electron spin hyperpolarization close to unity without the need for low temperatures nor high magnetic fields. Our results show the feasibility of solid&#8208;state DNP in conductive polymers that are known to exhibit chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Gallium Intermetallic Compounds with Tailored Active Site Configurations for Electrochemical Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The obtained CoGa intermetallic compounds with body&#8208;centered cubic (bcc) structure and isolated electron&#8208;rich Co atoms enhance the adsorption strength of *NO3 intermediate and simultaneously suppress the formation of hydrogen, which effectively reduces the energy barrier of the potential&#8208;determining step in the electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) process, thus significantly improving the NO3RR activity and selectivity.







Abstract
Gallium (Ga) with a low melting point can serve as a unique metallic solvent in the synthesis of intermetallic compounds (IMCs). The negative formation enthalpy of transition metal&#8208;Ga IMCs endows them with high catalytic stability. Meanwhile, their tunable crystal structures offer the possibility to tailor the configurations of active sites to meet the requirements for specific catalytic applications. Herein, we present a general method for preparing a range of transition metal&#8208;Ga IMCs, including Co&#8722;Ga, Ni&#8722;Ga, Pt&#8722;Ga, Pd&#8722;Ga, and Rh&#8722;Ga IMCs. The structurally ordered CoGa IMCs with body&#8208;centered cubic (bcc) structure are uniformly dispersed on the nitrogen&#8208;doped reduced graphene oxide substrate (O&#8208;CoGa/NG) and deliver outstanding nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) performance, making them excellent catalysts to construct highly efficient rechargeable Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery. Operando studies and theoretical simulations demonstrate that the electron&#8208;rich environments around the Co atoms enhance the adsorption strength of *NO3 intermediate and simultaneously suppress the formation of hydrogen, thus improving the NO3RR activity and selectivity.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Absorbance&#8208;Activated Droplet Sorting for Engineering Aldehyde Dehydrogenases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An absorbance&#8208;activated droplet sorting platform was developed for library screening. Absorbance in picoliter droplets is measured using a lithographic mask, with sorted droplets identified by impedance detection. This method allows sensitive detection and sorting at kHz rates. The efficiency of the platform is demonstrated by screening a 105&#8208;member aldehyde dehydrogenase library, yielding a variant with a 51&#8201;% improvement in catalytic efficiency.







Abstract
Recent decades have seen a dramatic increase in the commercial use of biocatalysts, transitioning from energy&#8208;intensive traditional chemistries to more sustainable methods. Current enzyme engineering techniques, such as directed evolution, require the generation and testing of large mutant libraries to identify optimized variants. Unfortunately, conventional screening methods are unable to screen such large libraries in a robust and timely manner. Droplet&#8208;based microfluidic systems have emerged as a powerful high&#8208;throughput tool for library screening at kilohertz rates. Unfortunately, almost all reported systems are based on fluorescence detection, restricting their use to a limited number of enzyme types that naturally convert fluorogenic substrates or require the use of surrogate substrates. To expand the range of enzymes amenable to evolution using droplet&#8208;based microfluidic systems, we present an absorbance&#8208;activated droplet sorter that allows droplet sorting at kilohertz rates without the need for optical monitoring of the microfluidic system. To demonstrate the utility of the sorter, we rapidly screen a 105&#8208;member aldehyde dehydrogenase library towards D&#8208;glyceraldehyde using a NADH mediated coupled assay that generates WST&#8208;1 formazan as the colorimetric product. We successfully identify a variant with a 51&#8201;% improvement in catalytic efficiency and a significant increase in overall activity across a broad substrate spectrum.

         <title>A Room&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Restocking Strategy for the Direct Reuse of Degraded LiFePO4 Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy for the direct reuse of spent LiFePO4 electrodes is developed by simply soaking the spent electrodes in a lithiation reagent solution at room temperature for 6&#8197;min. Being reused directly, the regenerated LiFePO4 electrode delivers a high specific capacity of 162.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even after being exposed in air for 3&#8197;months.







Abstract
The sustainable development of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries calls for efficient recycling technologies for spent LFP (SLFP). Even for the advanced direct material regeneration (DMR) method, multiple steps including separation, regeneration, and electrode refabrication processes are still needed. To circumvent these intricacies, new regeneration methods that allow direct electrode reuse (DER) by rejuvenating SLFP electrodes without damaging its structure are desired. Here, a 0.1&#8197;M lithium triethyl borohydride/tetrahydrofuran solution, which has the proper reductive capability to reduce Fe3+ in SLFP to Fe2+ without alloying with the aluminum current collector, is selected as the lithiation/regeneration reagent to restock the Li loss and regenerate SLFP electrodes. By soaking the SLFP electrodes in the lithiation solution, we successfully rejuvenated the crystal structure and electrochemical activity of SLFP electrodes with structural integrity within only 6&#8197;minutes at room temperature. When being directly reused, the regenerated LFP electrodes deliver a high specific capacity of 162.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even after being exposed to air for 3&#8197;months. The DER strategy presents significant economic and environmental benefits compared with the DMR method. This research provides a timely and innovative solution for recycling spent blade batteries using large&#8208;sized LFP electrodes, boosting the closed&#8208;loop development of LFP batteries.

         <title>Potent and Protease Resistant Azapeptide Agonists of the GLP&#8208;1 and GIP Receptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azapeptides are highly structured and protease resistant peptidomimetics that are bioisosteric replacements for &#945;&#8208;amino acids. A single atom change in 3.5&#8197;kDa peptides from C&#945; to N&#945; was used to generate equipotent GLP&#8208;1R and GIPR mono agonists, and a unimolecular dual agonist. All azapeptide analogues were fully refractory to the front&#8208;line protease, DPP4, that degrades GLP&#8208;1 and GIP within minutes.







Abstract
The gut&#8208;derived peptide hormones glucagon&#8208;like peptide&#8208;1 (GLP&#8208;1) and glucose&#8208;dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) play important physiological roles including glucose homeostasis and appetite suppression. Stabilized agonists of the GLP&#8208;1 receptor (GLP&#8208;1R) and dual agonists of GLP&#8208;1R and GIP receptor (GIPR) for the management of type&#8197;2 diabetes and obesity have generated widespread enthusiasm and have become blockbuster drugs. These therapeutics are refractory to the action of dipeptidyl peptidase&#8208;4 (DPP4), that catalyzes rapid removal of the two N&#8208;terminal residues of the native peptides, in turn severely diminishing their activity profiles. Here we report that a single atom change from carbon to nitrogen in the backbone of the entire peptide makes them refractory to DPP4 action while still retaining full potency and efficacy at their respective receptors. This was accomplished by use of aza&#8208;amino acids, that are bioisosteric replacements for &#945;&#8208;amino acids that perturb the structural backbone and local side chain conformations. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that aza&#8208;amino acid can populate the same conformational space that GLP&#8208;1 adopts when bound to the GLP&#8208;1R. The insertion of an aza&#8208;amino acid at the second position from the N&#8208;terminus in semaglutide and in a dual agonist of GLP&#8208;1R and GIPR further demonstrates its capability as a viable alternative to current DPP4 resistance strategies while offering additional structural variation that may influence downstream signaling.

         <title>Triphasic Hydroxysilylation of Alkenes by Mechanically Piezoelectric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanochemical strategy for the 1,2&#8208;hydroxysilylation of both activated and unactivated alkenes using silylboronate and oxygen gas, facilitated by piezoelectric materials (Li2TiO3) serving as a redox catalyst in a triphasic catalytic system is introduced. This approach offers multiple advantages, including a brief reaction time of 30 minutes, solvent&#8208;free conditions, catalyst recyclability, and the avoidance of the need for strong base activation of silylboronate or external reductants.







Abstract
The 1,2&#8208;hydroxysilylation of alkenes is crucial for synthesizing organosilicon compounds which are key intermediates in material science, pharmaceuticals, and organic synthesis. The development of strategies employing hydrogen atom transfer pathways is currently hindered by the existence of various competing reactions. Herein, we reported a novel mechanochemical strategy for the triphasic 1,2&#8208;hydroxysilylation of alkenes through a single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer pathway. Our approach not only circumvents competitive reactions to enable the first&#8208;ever 1,2&#8208;hydroxysilylation of unactivated alkenes but also pioneers the research in mechanic force&#8208;induced triphasic reactions under ambient conditions. This gentle method offers excellent compatibility with various functional groups, operates under simple and solvent&#8208;free conditions, ensures rapid reaction time. Preliminary mechanistic investigations suggest that silylboronate can be transformed to a silicon radical by highly polarized Li2TiO3 particles and oxygen under ball&#8208;milling condition.

Here, thiourea isomer derivatives [(3,5&#8208;dichlorophenyl)amino]thiourea (AT) and N&#8208;(3,5&#8208;dichlorophenyl)hydrazinecarbothioamide (HB) were developed. It is found that AT can effectively regulate crystallization process and passivate defects of perovskite by binding with undercoordinated Pb2+ through synergistic interaction between N1 and C=S group with a defect formation energy of 1.80&#8197;eV. The AT&#8208;treated device engenders an efficiency of 25.71&#8201;% and excellent stability.







Abstract
Various isomers have been developed to regulate the morphology and reduce defects in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art perovskite solar cells (PSCs). To insight the structure&#8208;function&#8208;effect correlations for the isomerization of thiourea derivatives on the performance of the PSCs, we developed two thiourea derivatives [(3,5&#8208;dichlorophenyl)amino]thiourea (AT) and N&#8208;(3,5&#8208;dichlorophenyl)hydrazinecarbothioamide (HB). Supported by experimental and calculated results, it was found that AT can bind with undercoordinated Pb2+ defect through synergistic interaction between N1 and C=S group with a defect formation energy of 1.818&#8197;eV, which is much higher than that from the synergistic interaction between two &#8722;NH&#8722; groups in HB and perovskite (1.015&#8197;eV). Moreover, the stronger interaction between AT and Pb2+ regulates the crystallization process of perovskite film to obtain a high&#8208;quality perovskite film with high crystallinity, large grain size, and low defect density. Consequently, the AT&#8208;treated FACsPbI3 device engenders an efficiency of 25.71&#8201;% (certified as 24.66&#8201;%), which is greatly higher than control (23.74&#8201;%) and HB&#8208;treated FACsPbI3 devices (25.05&#8201;%). The resultant device exhibits a remarkable stability for maintaining 91.0&#8201;% and 95.2&#8201;% of its initial efficiency after aging 2000&#8197;h in air condition or tracking at maximum power point for 1000&#8197;h, respectively.

         <title>Hydrogen Sulfide&#8208;Triggered Artificial DNAzyme Switches for Precise Manipulation of Cellular Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gas signaling molecule&#8208;responsive artificial DNAzyme&#8208;based switches (GRAS) have been developed as H2S&#8208;driven nanodevices for manipulating cellular functions. GRAS is highly programmable and versatile, enabling the customization of user&#8208;defined H2S signaling inputs to down&#8208;regulate mRNA expression and activate RTK signaling pathways at various subcellular levels, thereby allowing for precise regulation of cell behavior.







Abstract
The development of synthetic molecular tools responsive to biological cues is crucial for advancing targeted cellular regulation. A significant challenge is the regulation of cellular processes in response to gaseous signaling molecules such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S). To address this, we present the design of Gas signaling molecule&#8208;Responsive Artificial DNAzyme&#8208;based Switches (GRAS) to manipulate cellular functions via H2S&#8208;sensitive synthetic DNAzymes. By incorporating stimuli&#8208;responsive moieties to the phosphorothioate backbone, DNAzymes are strategically designed with H2S&#8208;responsive azide groups at cofactor binding locations within the catalytic core region. These modifications enable their activation through H2S&#8208;reducing decaging, thereby initiating substrate cleavage activity. Our approach allows for the flexible customization of various DNAzymes to regulate distinct cellular processes in diverse scenarios. Intracellularly, the enzymatic activity of GRAS promotes H2S&#8208;induced cleavage of specific mRNA sequences, enabling targeted gene silencing and inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. Moreover, integrating GRAS with dynamic DNA assembly allows for grafting these functional switches onto cell surface receptors, facilitating H2S&#8208;triggered receptor dimerization. This extracellular activation transmits signals intracellularly to regulate cellular behaviors such as migration and proliferation. Collectively, synthetic switches are capable of rewiring cellular functions in response to gaseous cues, offering a promising avenue for advanced targeted cellular engineering.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Catalytic Cascade for the Depolymerization of the Lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 Motif to Non&#8208;phenolic Dealkylated Aromatics</title>

An atom&#8208;efficient domino strategy maximizing the yield of non&#8208;phenolic dealkylated aromatics from the lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 motif by one&#8208;pot catalytic cascade, consisting of selective dehydrogenation of &#947;&#8208;carbinol group, retro&#8208;aldol to cleave C&#8722;C bonds, and decarbonylation of the generated aldehydes.







Abstract
Aromatic monomers obtained by selective depolymerization of the lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 motif are typically phenolic and contain (oxygenated) alkyl substitutions. This work reveals the potential of a one&#8208;pot catalytic lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 depolymerization cascade strategy that yields a uniform set of methoxylated aromatics without alkyl side&#8208;chains. This cascade consists of the selective acceptorless dehydrogenation of the &#947;&#8208;hydroxy group, a subsequent retro&#8208;aldol reaction that cleaves the C&#945;&#8722;C&#946; bond, followed by in situ acceptorless decarbonylation of the formed aldehydes. This three&#8208;step cascade reaction, catalyzed by an iridium(I)&#8208;BINAP complex, resulted in 75&#8201;% selectivity for 1,2&#8208;dimethoxybenzene from G&#8208;type lignin dimers, alongside syngas (CO&#8201;:&#8201;H2&#8776;1.4&#8201;:&#8201;1). Applying this method to a synthetic G&#8208;type polymer, 11&#8197;wt&#8201;% 1,2&#8208;dimethoxybenzene was obtained. This versatile compound can be easily transformed into 3,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenol, a valuable precursor for pharmaceutical synthesis, through an enzymatic catalytic approach. Moreover, the hydrodeoxygenation potential of 1,2&#8208;dimethoxybenzene offers a pathway to produce valuable cyclohexane or benzene derivatives, presenting enticing opportunities for sustainable chemical transformations without the necessity for phenolic mixture upgrading via dealkylation.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processable MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF System Constructed via Template&#8208;Assisted Growth for Ultratrace H2S Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>

The stable Ni3(HITP)2/NUS&#8208;8 systems, synthesized via an innovative template&#8208;assisted approach, display high conductivity, porosity, and solution processability. Gas sensors utilizing these systems demonstrate significant sensitivity to ultratrace H2S at room temperature and outstanding selectivity. Additionally, wearable sensors integrating these systems can capture human motion signals, opening up new possibilities for such devices.







Abstract
Conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (c&#8208;MOFs) hold promise for highly sensitive sensing systems due to their conductivity and porosity. However, the fabrication of c&#8208;MOF thin films with controllable morphology, thickness, and preferential orientation remains a formidable yet ubiquitous challenge. Herein, we propose an innovative template&#8208;assisted strategy for constructing MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF (Ni3(HITP)2/NUS&#8208;8 (HITP: 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexamino&#8208;tri (p&#8208;phenylene))) systems with good electrical conductivity, porosity, and solution processability. Leveraging the 2D nature and solution processability of NUS&#8208;8, we achieve the controllable self&#8208;assembly of Ni3(HITP)2 on NUS&#8208;8 nanosheets, producing solution&#8208;processable Ni3(HITP)2/NUS&#8208;8 nanosheets with a film conductivity of 1.55&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. Notably, the excellent solution processability facilitates the fabrication of large&#8208;area thin films and printing of intricate patterns with good uniformity, and the Ni3(HITP)2/NUS&#8208;8&#8208;based system can monitor finger bending. Gas sensors based on Ni3(HITP)2/NUS&#8208;8 exhibit high sensitivity (LOD~6&#8197;ppb) and selectivity towards ultratrace H2S at room temperature, attributed to the coupling between Ni3(HITP)2 and NUS&#8208;8 and the redox reaction with H2S. This approach not only unlocks the potential of stacking different MOF layers in a sequence to generate functionalities that cannot be achieved by a single MOF, but also provides novel avenues for the scalable integration of MOFs in miniaturized devices with salient sensing performance.

         <title>An Integrated Module Performs Selective &#8216;Online&#8217; Epoxidation in the Biosynthesis of the Antibiotic Mupirocin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mupirocin is a clinically important and biosynthetically challenging polyketide antibiotic that requires key assembly steps including epoxidation, tetrahydropyran ring formation and fatty acid esterification. A linear polyketide fragment of mupirocin with six asymmetric centres was synthesized, and it was demonstrated that the mini&#8208;module MmpE is docked to MmpA and performs a rare online (ACP&#8208;substrate) epoxidation using a previously unannotated ACP.







Abstract
The delineation of the complex biosynthesis of the potent antibiotic mupirocin, which consists of a mixture of pseudomonic acids (PAs) isolated from Pseudomonas fluorescens NCIMB 10586, presents significant challenges, and the timing and mechanisms of several key transformations remain elusive. Particularly intriguing are the steps that process the linear backbone from the initial polyketide assembly phase to generate the first cyclic intermediate PA&#8208;B. These include epoxidation as well as incorporation of the tetrahydropyran (THP) ring and fatty acid side chain required for biological activity. Herein, we show that the mini&#8208;module MmpE performs a rare online (ACP&#8208;substrate) epoxidation and is integrated (&#8216;in&#8208;cis&#8217;) into the polyketide synthase via a docking domain. A linear polyketide fragment with six asymmetric centres was synthesised using a convergent approach and used to demonstrate substrate flux via an atypical KS0 and a previously unannotated ACP (MmpE_ACP). MmpE_ACP&#8208;bound synthetic substrates were critical in demonstrating successful epoxidation in vitro by the purified MmpE oxidoreductase domain. Alongside feeding studies, these results confirm the timing as well as chain length dependence of this selective epoxidation. These mechanistic studies pinpoint the location and nature of the polyketide substrate prior to the key formation of the THP ring and esterification that generate PA&#8208;B.

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Type Supra&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Dots with Long Lifetime Photogenerated Radicals Boosting Tumor Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>

A donor&#8208;acceptor type supra&#8208;CDs has been fabricated by using red emissive CDs as donor and electron&#8208;withdrawing molecule as acceptor. This peculiar donor&#8208;acceptor configuration facilitates the efficient charge separation in supra&#8208;CDs, thereby generating more superoxide radicals and additional holes&#8208;related radicals, which collectively boosts type&#8208;I tumor photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) have gained significant interest because of their potential in biomedical applications. Nevertheless, developing CDs with efficient photoinduced charge separation for tumor photodynamic therapy (PDT) remains a challenge. This study presents a novel class of supra&#8208;carbon&#8208;dots (supra&#8208;CDs) developed by fusing red emissive CDs with 2,3&#8208;dicyanohydroquinone (DCHQ) via post&#8208;solvothermal treatment. In supra&#8208;CDs, the core, acting as electron donors, is formed by assembled CDs with substantial sp2 domains, the fused interface originating from DCHQ with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups functions as the electron acceptor. This configuration creates the unique donor&#8208;acceptor nanostructure. Upon white light irradiation, the excited electrons from the assembled CDs were transferred to the electron&#8208;withdrawing interface, whereas the photogenerated holes were retained within the assembled CDs as radicals, leading to effective photoinduced charge separation. The separated photogenerated electrons then react with oxygen to generate superoxide radicals. Simultaneously, the photogenerated holes undergo oxidation of crucial cellular substrates. This dual action underscores the exceptional cell&#8208;killing efficacy of supra&#8208;CDs. Moreover, the increased particle sizes (~20&#8197;nm) ensure supra&#8208;CDs to exhibit a notable capacity for tumor accumulation via the improved permeability and retention effect, thereby achieving satisfactory anti&#8208;tumor PDT efficacy in a mouse subcutaneous tumor model.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Switchable Lattice Oxygen Sites for Selective C&#8722;H and C(O)&#8722;C Bond Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light&#8208;switching strategy for in situ formulating stationary or removable lattice&#8208;oxygen sites in ESE&#8208;NiOOH is developed with ultrahigh selectivity for electrocatalytic upgrading of aromatic secondary alcohols via direct dehydrogenation to acetophenones or C(O)&#8722;C bond cleavage to benzoic acids. Precisely modulating lattice&#8208;oxygen removability is reported for the first time to activate C&#8722;H and vector downstream reactions.







Abstract
Lattice&#8208;oxygen is highly oxidizable, ideal for electrocatalytic C&#8722;H oxidation but insufficient alone for C(O)&#8722;C bond cleavage due to the non&#8208;removable nature of lattice sites. Here, we present a visible light&#8208;assisted electrochemical method of in situ formulating removable lattice&#8208;oxygen sites in a nickel&#8208;oxyhydroxide (ESE&#8208;NiOOH) electrocatalyst. This catalyst efficiently converts aromatic alcohols and carbonyls with C(O)&#8722;C fragments from lignin and plastics into benzoic acids (BAs) with high yields (83&#8211;99&#8201;%). Without light irradiation, ESE&#8208;NiOOH's intrinsic lattice&#8208;oxygen is non&#8208;removable and inert for C(O)&#8722;C bond cleavage. In situ characterizations show light&#8208;induced lattice&#8208;oxygen removal and regeneration via OH&#8722; refilling. Theoretical calculations identify the nucleophilic oxygen attack on ketone&#8208;derived carbanion as a rate&#8208;determining step, which can be remarkably facilitated by removable lattice&#8208;oxygen to activate &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, an &#8220;electrochemical funnel&#8221; strategy is developed for high&#8208;efficiency upgrading aromatic mixtures with C(O)&#8722;C moieties into BA with up to 94&#8201;% yield. This in situ removal&#8208;regeneration approach for lattice sites opens an avenue for the tailored design of interfacial electrocatalysts to selectively upcycle waste carbon sources into valuable products.

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Metformin Conjugates Acting as Promising PD&#8208;L1 Inhibitors through the AMP&#8208;Activated Protein Kinase Mediated Lysosomal Degradation Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A platinum&#8208;metformin conjugate was developed to modulate the immunosuppressive microenvironment through PD&#8722;L1 down&#8208;regulation and hypoxia reversion, leading to highly efficient immunochemotherapy by a single small&#8208;molecular Pt(II) complex. The study led to the proposal of an AMPK&#8208;mediated lysosomal degradation pathway of PD&#8722;L1 for the first time.







Abstract
With the development of metalloimmunology, the potential of platinum drugs in cancer immunotherapy has attracted extensive attention. Although immunochemotherapy combining PD&#8208;1/PD&#8722;L1 antibodies with platinum drugs has achieved great success in the clinic, combination therapy commonly brings new problems. Herein, we have developed a platinum&#8208;metformin conjugate as a promising alternative to antibody&#8208;based PD&#8722;L1 inhibitors, not only disrupting PD&#8208;1/PD&#8722;L1 axis on cell surface but also down&#8208;regulating the total PD&#8722;L1 levels in non&#8208;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells comprehensively, thus achieving highly efficient immunochemotherapy by a single small molecule. Mechanism studies demonstrate that Pt&#8208;metformin conjugate can selectively accumulate in lysosomes, promote lysosomal&#8208;dependent PD&#8722;L1 degradation via the AMPK&#8208;TFEB pathway, and modulate the upstream regulatory proteins related to PD&#8722;L1 expression (e.g. HIF&#8208;1&#945; and NF&#8208;&#954;B), eventually decreasing the total abundance of PD&#8722;L1 in NSCLC, overcoming tumor hypoxia, and activating anti&#8208;tumor immunity in vivo. This work suggests an AMPK&#8208;mediated lysosomal degradation pathway of PD&#8722;L1 for the first time and provides a unique design perspective for the development of novel platinum drugs for immunochemotherapy.

         <title>Highly Selective CO2 Electroreduction to Multi&#8208;Carbon Alcohols via Amine Modified Copper Nanoparticles at Acidic Conditions</title>

The Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ products was significantly enhanced over Cu by the modification of n&#8208;butylamine at acidic media. The FE of C2+ products could reach up to 81.8&#8201;% with a total current density of 410&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the FE of C2+ alcohols was 52.6&#8201;%. The amine molecule on the surface of Cu could not only enhance the formation, adsorption and coverage of *CO, but also provide a hydrophobic environment, which resulted in the high selectivity of C2+ alcohols at acidic condition.







Abstract
Electroreduction of CO2 into multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products (e.g. C2+ alcohols) offers a promising way for CO2 utilization. Use of strong alkaline electrolytes is favorable to producing C2+ products. However, CO2 can react with hydroxide to form carbonate/bicarbonate, which results in low carbon utilization efficiency and poor stability. Using acidic electrolyte is an efficient way to solve the problems, but it is a challenge to achieve high selectivity of C2+ products. Here we report that the amine modified copper nanoparticles exhibit high selectivity of C2+ products and carbon utilization at acidic condition. The Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ products reach up to 81.8&#8201;% at acidic media (pH=2) with a total current density of 410&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over n&#8208;butylamine modified Cu. Especially the FE of C2+ alcohols is 52.6&#8201;%, which is higher than those reported for CO2 electroreduction at acidic condition. In addition, the single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency towards C2+ production reach up to 60&#8201;%. Detailed studies demonstrate that the amine molecule on the surface of Cu cannot only enhance the formation, adsorption and coverage of *CO, but also provide a hydrophobic environment, which result in the high selectivity of C2+ alcohols at acidic condition.

         <title>Precise Preparation of Supramolecular Spherical Nucleic Acids for Nucleolin&#8208;Targeted Gene Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise supramolecular nucleic acids (Supra&#8208;SNAs) were designed by incorporating a pair of &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin modified with multiple nucleic acids and adamantane with functional targeting nucleic acid. These Supra&#8208;SNAs with multivalent structure exhibit enhanced nuclease resistance, cellular uptake, and gene regulation capabilities in comparison to single&#8208;stranded DNA molecule. Moreover, the inhibition of gene expression in tumor cells leads to down&#8208;regulate PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and thus effective cell proliferation and death against tumor cells.







Abstract
Molecular spherical nucleic acids (m&#8208;SNAs) are a second generation of spherical nucleic acids (SNAs), which are of significance in potential application of targeted delivery of nucleic acids or gene regulation due to their defined molecular structures. Nevertheless, m&#8208;SNAs typically involve a single DNA sequence which greatly limits its functions as either targeting purpose or gene regulation. In response, we proposed here a third generation, supramolecular spherical nucleic acids (Supra&#8208;SNAs) with two different sequences to achieve both above&#8208;mentioned functions. Specifically, we constructed a series of supramolecular self&#8208;assembly structures by coupling a cell membrane receptor (i.e., nucleolin)&#8208;recognizing aptamer (AS1411)&#8208;modified adamantine as targeting probe and human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) antisense&#8208;functionalized &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin to specifically inhibit the overexpression of HER2 proteins for gene regulations. In comparison to the m&#8208;SNA precursors, such Supra&#8208;SNA structures exhibited enhanced levels of resistance to nuclease degradation, cellular uptake, gene regulation capabilities and tumor retention capacity. We demonstrated that Supra&#8208;SNAs exhibited optimal cell suppression rates and cell apoptosis via a phosphatidylinositol 3&#8208;kinase/protein kinase B signaling pathway. The well&#8208;defined molecular structures provide an attractive platform for investigating interrelationship between structure and property at the molecular level.

         <title>Pentagon&#8208;Rich Caged Carbon Catalyst for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Acidic Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have synthesized caged carbon catalysts enriched with pentagonal structures and investigated their catalytic activity for the high&#8208;performance oxygen reduction reaction. The origin of the ORR activity of the pentagon&#8208;containing carbon catalyst lies in the spin that localizes in the pentagon ring. The SOMO of pentagon&#8208;containing molecules is characterized by &#960; orbitals and is energetically low, which promotes effective oxygen adsorption.







Abstract
The interaction between electron spin and oxygen molecules in non&#8208;platinum catalysts, particularly carbon catalysts, significantly influences the catalytic performance of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). A promising approach to developing high&#8208;performance catalysts involves introducing five&#8208;membered ring structures with spin into graphitic carbons. In this study, we present the successful synthesis of cage&#8208;like cubic carbon catalysts enriched with pentagon structures using pentagon ring&#8208;containing C60 and a NaCl template. The number of pentagons contained in the structure was increased by doping with nitrogen and annealing, and the number of electron spins also increased, thereby improving catalytic activity. The prepared catalyst exhibits remarkable activity in ORR under acidic electrolytes. Furthermore, we elucidate the correlation between the pentagon structure, the number of spin, and catalytic activity, demonstrating that enhanced activity is contingent upon the presence of spin. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the role of spin in improving activity. The concept of spin and the introduction of pentagon structures provide new design principles for carbon catalysts.

         <title>Silylene&#8208;Copper&#8208;Amide Emitters: From Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence to Dual Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of emissive N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene Cu(I) amide complexes herald a significant advancement in the domain of linear two&#8208;coordinate Cu(I) emitters, characterized by their thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and dual emissive properties.







Abstract
Herein, we report the inaugural instance of N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene (NHSi)&#8208;coordinated copper amide emitters (2&#8211;5). These complexes exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and singlet&#8208;triplet dual emission in anaerobic conditions. The NHSi&#8208;Cu&#8208;diphenylamide (2) complex demonstrates TADF with a very small &#916;EST gap (0.01&#8197;eV), an absolute quantum yield of 11&#8201;%, a radiative rate of 2.55&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1, and a short &#964;TADF of 0.45&#8197;&#956;s in the solid state. The dual emissive complexes (3&#8211;5) achieve an absolute quantum yield of up to 20&#8201;% in the solid state with a kISC rate of 1.82&#215;108&#8197;s&#8722;1 and exhibit room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) with lifetimes up to 9&#8197;ms. The gradual decrease in the intensity of the triplet state of complex 3 under controlled oxygen exposure demonstrates its potential for future oxygen&#8208;sensing applications. Complexes 2 and 3 have been further utilized to fabricate converted LEDs, paving the way for future OLED production using newly synthesized NHSi&#8208;Cu&#8208;amides.

         <title>Isofunctional but Structurally Different Methyltransferases for Dithiolopyrrolone Diversification</title>

Two for one job: DtpM and XrdM are two bacterial enzymes that have different structures but still catalyze the same reaction: the amide N&#8208;methylation of dithiolopyrrolones (DTPs). Ligand binding to both enzymes was studied using X&#8208;ray crystallography, modeling, mutagenesis and activity assays. The results suggest that different organisms developed distinct methyltransferases for the same task by convergent evolution.







Abstract
Dithiolopyrrolone (DTP) natural products are produced by several different bacteria and have potent antibacterial, antifungal and anticancer activities. While the amide of their DTP core can be methylated to fine&#8208;tune bioactivity, the enzyme responsible for the amide N&#8208;methylation has remained elusive in most taxa. Here, we identified the amide methyltransferase XrdM that is responsible for xenorhabdin (XRD) methylation in Xenorhabdus doucetiae but encoded outside of the XRD gene cluster. XrdM turned out to be isofunctional with the recently reported methyltransferase DtpM, that is involved in the biosynthesis of the DTP thiolutin, although its X&#8208;ray structure is unrelated to that of DtpM. To investigate the structural basis for ligand binding in both enzymes, we used X&#8208;ray crystallography, modeling, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, and kinetic activity assays. Our study expands the limited knowledge of post&#8208;non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) amide methylation in DTP biosynthesis and reveals an example of convergent evolution of two structurally completely different enzymes for the same reaction in different organisms.

         <title>Iridium(III) Photosensitizers Induce Simultaneous Pyroptosis and Ferroptosis for Multi&#8208;Network Synergistic Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first case of metal&#8208;based small molecule dual&#8208;inducers of pyroptosis and ferroptosis is reported here. The iridium(III)&#8208;triphenylamine photosensitizers, IrC and IrF, can induce DNA damage&#8208;related gasdermin D (GSDMD)&#8208;mediated pyroptosis, along with regulating iron stress&#8208;related gasdermin E (GSDME)&#8208;mediated pyroptosis and glutathione peroxidase&#8197;4 (GPX4) depletion synergistically promoted ferroptosis, and further trigger a strong immune response.







Abstract
The integration of pyroptosis and ferroptosis hybrid cell death induction to augment immune activation represents a promising avenue for anti&#8208;tumor treatment, but there is a lack of research. Herein, we developed two iridium (III)&#8208;triphenylamine photosensitizers, IrC and IrF, with the capacity to disrupt redox balance and induce photo&#8208;driven cascade damage to DNA and Kelch&#8208;like ECH&#8208;associated protein&#8197;1 (KEAP1). The activation of the absent in melanoma&#8197;2 (AIM2)&#8208;related cytoplasmic nucleic acid&#8208;sensing pathway, triggered by damaged DNA, leads to the induction of gasdermin D (GSDMD)&#8208;mediated pyroptosis. Simultaneously, iron homeostasis, regulated by the KEAP1/nuclear factor erythroid 2&#8208;related factor&#8197;2 (NRF2)/heme oxygenase&#8197;1 (HO&#8208;1) pathway, serves as a pivotal bridge, facilitating not only the induction of gasdermin&#8197;E (GSDME)&#8208;mediated non&#8208;canonical pyroptosis, but also ferroptosis in synergy with glutathione peroxidase&#8197;4 (GPX4) depletion. The collaborative action of pyroptosis and ferroptosis generates a synergistic effect that elicits immunogenic cell death, stimulates a robust immune response and effectively inhibits tumor growth in vivo. Our work introduces the first metal&#8208;based small molecule dual&#8208;inducers of pyroptosis and ferroptosis for potent cancer immunotherapy, and highlights the significance of iron homeostasis as a vital hub connecting synergistic effects of pyroptosis and ferroptosis.

Electrochemical urea oxidation reaction (UOR) offers a promising alternative to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). An interface chemistry modulation strategy is proposed to boost UOR kinetics by creating a high&#8208;energy interfacial heterostructure. The strong interactions significantly promote internal electron exchanges, and the improved electron delocalization led to the formation of stronger bonds between Co sites and urea CO(NH2)2. This enhancement promotes a preference for urea to occupy Co active sites over OH*.







Abstract
Electrochemical urea oxidation reaction (UOR) offers a promising alternative to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in clean energy conversion and storage systems. Nickel&#8208;based catalysts are regarded as highly promising electrocatalysts for the UOR. However, their effectiveness is significantly hindered by the unavoidable self&#8208;oxidation reaction of nickel species during UOR. To address this challenge, we proposed an interface chemistry modulation strategy to boost UOR kinetics by creating a high&#8208;energy interfacial heterostructure. This heterostructure incorporates Ag at the CoOOH@NiOOH heterojunction interface, where strong interactions significantly promote the electron exchanges at the heterojunction interface between &#8208;OH and &#8208;O groups. Consequently, the improved electron delocalization leads to the formation of stronger bonds between Co sites and urea CO(NH2)2, promoting a preference for urea to occupy Co active sites over OH*. The resulting catalyst, Ag&#8722;CoOOH@NiOOH, demonstrates ultrahigh UOR activity with a low potential of 1.33&#8197;V at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The fabricated catalyst exhibits a mass activity over 11.9 times greater than the initial cobalt oxyhydroxide. The rechargeable urea&#8208;assisted zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) achieve a record&#8208;breaking energy efficiency of 74.56&#8201;% at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, remarkable durability (1000&#8197;hours at a current density of 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and quick charge performances.

         <title>Diatomic Catalysts for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries: Mechanistic Insights and Design Strategies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin exchange effect between diatomic sites activates the diatomic catalysts, effectively suppressing the shuttle effect of triiodide and facilitating the iodine conversion reaction. Utilizing MnZn&#8722;NC diatomic catalysts, the zinc&#8208;iodine battery demonstrates both a high specific capacity and exceptional cycling stability over 320,000&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
There has been a growing interest in developing catalysts to enable the reversible iodine conversion reaction for high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries (AZIBs). While diatomic catalysts (DACs) have demonstrated superior performance in various catalytic reactions due to their ability to facilitate synergistic charge interactions, their application in AZIBs remains unexplored. Herein, we present, for the first time, a DAC comprising Mn&#8722;Zn dual atoms anchored on a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix (MnZn&#8722;NC) for iodine loading, resulting in a high&#8208;performance AZIB with a capacity of 224&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and remarkable cycling stability over 320,000&#8197;cycles. The electron hopping along the Mn&#8722;N&#8722;Zn bridge is stimulated via a spin exchange mechanism. This process broadens the Mn 3dxy band width and enhances the metallic character of the catalyst, thus facilitating charge transfer between the catalysts and reaction intermediates. Additionally, the increased electron occupancy within the d&#8208;orbital of Zn elevates Zn's d&#8208;band center, thereby enhancing chemical interactions between MnZn&#8722;NC and I&#8208;based species. Furthermore, our mechanism demonstrates potential applicability to other Metal&#8208;Zn&#8722;NC DACs with spin&#8208;polarized atoms. Our work elucidates a clear mechanistic understanding of diatomic catalysts and provides new insights into catalyst design for AZIBs.

         <title>Rewritable Surface&#8208;Grafted Polymer Brushes with Dynamic Covalent Linkages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for the fabrication of rewritable surface&#8208;initiated polymer brushes with a relatively high grafting density grafted from both nanoparticles and macroscopic surfaces has been developed. The incorporation of a dynamic covalent chemical linkage at the &#8220;root&#8221; of the polymer brushes would, in principle, enable unlimited rounds of degrafting and regrafting of polymer brushes.







Abstract
Surface grafting of polymer brushes drastically modifies surface properties, including wettability, compatibility, responsiveness, etc. A broad variety of functionalities can be introduced to the surface via different types of polymers. Bringing together properties of two or more types of polymer brushes to one surface opens up even more possibilities in brush&#8208;modified materials. However, while it is generally feasible to introduce several chemical compositions along the brushes via copolymerization, it is challenging to vary the types of polymer brushes along a surface. Although previous studies have demonstrated binary brushes via orthogonal polymerization techniques or partial deactivation/regrafting, they commonly limit the number of polymer types to two. Here, we propose a strategy to introduce dynamic covalent diketoenamine linkages at the root of polymer brushes. The grafting density could be precisely tuned during surface functionalization. The surface&#8208;anchored polymer brushes were cleaved by the addition of small molecule amines. New polymer brushes can be regrafted from the surface following refunctionalization of exposed sites. The maneuverability allows tuning of the types and densities of the polymer brushes, pointing the way to the preparation of a new generation of well&#8208;defined brush&#8208;modified materials with mixed grafts, with potential applications in the design of smart materials and surfaces.

         <title>Dynamically Stabilizing Oxygen Atoms in Silver Catalyst for Highly Selective and Durable CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pulsed&#8208;bias technique was developed to dynamically stabilize oxygen atoms in silver (Ag) electrodes under operando conditions, allowing to achieve highly selective and durable electrochemical CO2 reduction catalysis.







Abstract
Oxide derived catalyst displays outstanding catalytic activity and selectivity in electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), in which, it is found that residue oxygen atoms play a pivotal role in regulating the catalyst's electronic structure and thus the CO2RR process. Unfortunately, the intrinsic thermodynamic instability of oxygen atoms in oxide derived catalyst under cathodic CO2RR potentials makes it unstable during continuous electrolysis, greatly hindering its practical industrial applications. In this work, we develop a pulsed&#8208;bias technique that is able to dynamically stabilize the residue oxygen atoms in oxide derived catalyst during electrochemical CO2RR. As a result, the oxide derived catalyst under pulsed bias exhibits super catalytic stability in catalyzing electrochemical CO2RR, while keeping excellent catalytic activity and selectivity.

         <title>Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Induced Flexible and Twisted Self&#8208;Assembly of Functionalized Carbon Dots with Customized&#8208;Color Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the exciting discovery of the surface modification of carbon dots drives the construction of an assembly asymmetric environment to realize a full&#8208;color circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in the aggregated state. Moreover, we explore panchromatic as well as white&#8208;light CPL applications of light emitting diodes and large flexible optical films, which provide new material strategies for virtual reality, medical imaging, and scientific visualization, among others.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has numerous applications in optical data storage, quantum computing, bioresponsive imaging, liquid crystal displays, and backlights in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) displays. In addition to their competitive optical properties, carbon dots (CDs) benefit from simple and low&#8208;cost preparation, facile post&#8208;modification, and excellent resistance to photo&#8208; and chemical bleaching after carbonization. Combining the superior optical performance with polarization peculiarities through hierarchical structure engineering is imperative for the development of CDs. In this study, hydrophobic interactions of aromatic ligands, which participate in the surface&#8208;ligand post&#8208;modification process on the ground&#8208;state chiral carbon core, are employed to drive the oriented assembly. Furthermore, the residual chiral amides on CDs form multiple hydrogen bonds during gradual aggregation, causing the assembled materials to form an asymmetric bending structure. Superficial ligands interfere with the optical dynamics of the exciton radiation transition and stabilize the excited state of the assembled materials to achieve a circularly polarized signal. The linkage ligands overcome the frequent aggregation&#8208;induced quenching phenomenon that present difficulties in conventional CDs, facilitate the assembly of self&#8208;supporting films, and improve chiral optical expression. The full&#8208;color and white CPL are manipulated by simply adjusting the functional groups of the ligands, which also illustrates the versatility of the post&#8208;modification strategy. Finally, large chiral flexible films and multicolor chiral light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the stable chiral powder phosphors were constructed, thereby providing feasible materials and technical support for flexible 3D displays.

         <title>Rare Earth Er&#8208;Nd Dual Single&#8208;Atomic Catalysts for Efficient Visible&#8208;light Induced CO2 Reduction to CnH2n+1OH (n=1, 2)</title>

         <dc:description>
The dual single atoms (SAs) catalyst Er3Nd1/CN is designed and synthesized by atomic confinement and coordination strategies, and exhibits record&#8208;level rates of 1761.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and 987.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for CH3CH2OH and CH3OH in CO2 photoreduction. Synchrotron radiation, in&#8208;situ test, and density functional theory (DFT)calculations indicate that weaker *CO adsorption on the Nd tends to desorb and migrate to Er site for C&#8722;C coupling, which is the key to ethanol synthesis.







Abstract
Efficient synthesis of CnH2n+1OH (n=1, 2) via photochemical CO2 reduction holds promise for achieving carbon neutrality but remains challenging. Here, we present rare earth dual single atoms (SAs) catalysts containing ErN6 and NdN6 moieties, fabricated via an atom&#8208;confinement and coordination method. The dual Er&#8722;Nd SAs catalysts exhibit unprecedented generation rates of 1761.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and 987.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for CH3CH2OH and CH3OH, respectively. Through a combination of theoretical calculation, XAFS analysis, aberration&#8208;corrected HAADF&#8208;STEM, and in&#8208;situ FTIR spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the Er SAs facilitate charge transfer, serving as active centers for C&#8722;C bond formation, while Nd SAs provide the necessary *CO for C&#8722;C coupling in C2H5OH synthesis under visible light. Furthermore, the experiment and DFT calculation elucidate that the variety of electronic states induced by 4&#8201;f orbitals of the Er SAs and the p&#8722;f orbital hybridization of Er&#8722;N moieties enable the formation of charge&#8208;transfer channel. Therefore, this study sheds light on the pivotal role of *CO adsorption in achieving efficient conversion from CO2 to CnH2n+1OH (n=1, 2) via a novel rare earth&#8208;based dual SAs photocatalysis approach.

         <title>Non&#8208;Natural MUC1 Glycopeptide Homogeneous Cancer Vaccine with Enhanced Immunogenicity and Therapeutic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemically defined vaccine is prepared by combining the structural design of a non&#8208;natural glycopeptide antigen with a site&#8208;specific protein modification. The resulting vaccine, which contains a single copy of the antigen, is both prophylactically and therapeutically effective.

Glycopeptides derived from the glycoprotein mucin&#8208;1 (MUC1) have shown potential as tumor&#8208;associated antigens for cancer vaccine development. However, their low immunogenicity and non&#8208;selective conjugation to carriers present significant challenges for the clinical efficacy of MUC1&#8208;based vaccines. Here, we introduce a novel vaccine candidate based on a structure&#8208;guided design of an artificial antigen derived from MUC1 glycopeptide. This engineered antigen contains two non&#8208;natural amino acids and has an &#945;&#8208;S&#8208;glycosidic bond, where sulfur replaces the conventional oxygen atom linking the peptide backbone to the sugar N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine. The glycopeptide is then specifically conjugated to the immunogenic protein carrier CRM197 (Cross&#8208;Reactive Material 197), a protein approved for human use. Conjugation involves selective reduction and re&#8208;bridging of a disulfide in CRM197, allowing the attachment of a single copy of MUC1. This strategy results in a chemically defined vaccine while maintaining both the structural integrity and immunogenicity of the protein carrier. The vaccine elicits a robust Th1&#8208;like immune response in mice and generates antibodies capable of recognizing human cancer cells expressing tumor&#8208;associated MUC1. When tested in mouse models of colon adenocarcinoma and pancreatic cancer, the vaccine is effective both as a prophylactic and therapeutic use, significantly delaying tumor growth. In therapeutic applications, improved outcomes were observed when the vaccine was combined with an anti&#8208;programmed cell death protein 1 (anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1) checkpoint inhibitor. Our strategy reduces batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variability and enhances both immunogenicity and therapeutic potential. This site&#8208;specific approach disputes a prevailing dogma where glycoconjugate vaccines require multivalent display of antigens.

&lt;p&gt;A chemically defined vaccine is prepared by combining the structural design of a non-natural glycopeptide antigen with a site-specific protein modification. The resulting vaccine, which contains a single copy of the antigen, is both prophylactically and therapeutically effective. Importantly, this approach refutes a prevailing dogma that glycoconjugate vaccines require multivalent presentation of antigens.

         <title>Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting with a Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrogen Conversion Efficiency Exceeding 2&#8201;% through Halide Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic overall water splitting system is successfully developed using I3&#8722;/I&#8722; as the shuttle redox couple to bridge the H2&#8208;producing half&#8208;reaction with the O2&#8208;producing half&#8208;reaction. The system uses the halide perovskite of PMA2PbI4/MoS2 as the H2 evolution photocatalyst and theWO3/RuOx as the O2 evolution photocatalyst, achieving a H2/O2 production in stoichiometric ratio with an excellent STH of 2.07&#8201;%.







Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting using semiconductors is a promising approach for converting solar energy to clean energy. However, challenges such as sluggish water oxidation kinetics and limited light absorption of photocatalyst cause low solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency (STH). Herein, we develop a photocatalytic overall water splitting system using I3&#8722;/I&#8722; as the shuttle redox couple to bridge the H2&#8208;producing half&#8208;reaction with the O2&#8208;producing half&#8208;reaction. The system uses the halide perovskite of benzylammonium lead iodide (PMA2PbI4, PMA=C6H5CH2NH2) loaded with MoS2 (PMA2PbI4/MoS2) as the H2 evolution photocatalyst, and the RuOx&#8208;loaded WO3 (WO3/RuOx) as the O2 evolution photocatalyst, achieving a H2/O2 production in stoichiometric ratio with an excellent STH of 2.07&#8201;%. This work provides a detour route for photocatalytic water splitting with the help of I3&#8722;/I&#8722; shuttle redox couple in the halide perovskite HI splitting system and enlightens one to integrate and utilize multi catalytic strategies for solar&#8208;driven water splitting.

         <title>Pulsed EPR Methods in the Angstrom to Nanometre Scale Shed Light on the Conformational Flexibility of a Fluoride Riboswitch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluoride sensing riboswitch was investigated by EPR&#8208;based distance measurements. Electron&#8208;electron double resonance revealed preorganisation of the stem structures and conformational flexibility while electron&#8208;nuclear double resonance demonstrates low structural heterogeneity around the fluoride site and distinct differences between the crystal and solution structures.







Abstract
Riboswitches control gene regulation upon external stimuli such as environmental factors or ligand binding. The fluoride sensing riboswitch from Thermotoga petrophila is a complex regulatory RNA proposed to be involved in resistance to F&#8722; cytotoxicity. The details of structure and dynamics underpinning the regulatory mechanism are currently debated. Here we demonstrate that a combination of pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (ESR/EPR) spectroscopies, detecting distances in the angstrom to nanometre range, can probe distinct regions of conformational flexibility in this riboswitch. PELDOR (pulsed electron&#8208;electron double resonance) revealed a similar preorganisation of the sensing domain in three forms, i.e. the free aptamer, the Mg2+&#8208;bound apo, and the F&#8722;&#8208;bound holo form. 19F&#8197;ENDOR (electron&#8208;nuclear double resonance) was used to investigate the active site structure of the F&#8722;&#8208;bound holo form. Distance distributions without a priori structural information were compared with in silico modelling of spin label conformations based on the crystal structure. While PELDOR, probing the periphery of the RNA fold, revealed conformational flexibility of the RNA backbone, ENDOR indicated low structural heterogeneity at the ligand binding site. Overall, the combination of PELDOR and ENDOR with sub&#8208;angstrom precision gave insight into structural organisation and flexibility of a riboswitch, not easily attainable by other biophysical techniques.

         <title>Enhanced Propylene/Propane Separation via Aniline&#8208;Decorated ZIF&#8208;8 Membrane: Lattice Rigidity Adjustment and Adsorption Site Introduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aperture flexibility of the metal&#8211;organic framework (ZIF&#8208;8) and the inherent weak adsorption ability of propylene can be tailored through the introduction of a guest molecule of aniline, encapsulated in the cavities of ZIF&#8208;8. The rigid Cm polymorph phase instead of the usual I_43&#8197;m phase of ZIF&#8208;8, along with the introduction of aniline as an adsorption site, enables the membrane good and stable C3H6/C3H8 separation.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based membranes excel in molecular separation, attracting significant research interest. The crystallographic microstructure and selective adsorption capacity of MOFs closely correlate with their gas separation performance. Here, aniline was added to the ZIF&#8208;8 synthesis in varying concentrations. Aniline, encapsulated within ZIF&#8208;8 cavities, interacts strongly with the 2&#8208;methylimidazole linker, resulting in both a shift in crystallographic phase from I_43&#8197;m to Cm in Rietveld refinement of X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and the selective adsorption behavior between propylene and propane. Consequently, an aniline decorative ZIF&#8208;8 (Anix&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8) membrane was prepared using a fast current&#8208;driven synthesis method, which exhibits good propylene/propane separation selectivity of up to 85. Calculation of the interaction energy between aniline and the various crystallographic phases of ZIF&#8208;8 using density functional theory (DFT) further verifies that aniline not only promotes the formation of crystallographic Cm phase, but also enhances the adsorption selectivity of propylene over propane. Aniline modification effectively tunes the crystallographic microstructure of ZIF&#8208;8, thereby, improving molecular sieving capabilities.

         <title>Metallic Impurities in Electrolysis: Catalytic Effect of Pb Traces in Reductive Amination and Acetone Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Studying the reductive amination of acetone with methylamine as nitrogen source using electrochemistry revealed the catalytic activity of 1&#8197;ppm Pb. In addition, the effects of the applied potential and the cathode materials on the reaction were investigated. Finally, the results were transferred to the electrochemical hydrogenation of acetone.







Abstract
The electrochemical hydrogenation (e&#8208;hydrogenation) of unsaturated compounds like imines or carbonyls presents a benign reduction method. It enables direct use of electrons as reducing agent, water as proton source, while bypassing the need for elevated temperatures or pressures. In this contribution, we discuss the active species in electrocatalytic reductive amination with the transformation of acetone and methylamine as model reaction. Surprisingly, lead impurities in the ppm&#8208;range proved to possess a significant effect in e&#8208;hydrogenation. Accordingly, the influence of applied potential and cathode material in presence of 1&#8197;ppm Pb was investigated. Finally, we transferred the insights to the reduction of acetone manifesting comparable observations as for imine reduction. The results suggest that previous studies on electrochemical reduction in the presence of lead electrodes should be re&#8208;evaluated.

         <title>High&#8208;Energy Ball Milling Enables an Ultra&#8208;Fast Wittig Olefination Under Ambient and Solvent&#8208;free Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a protocol for a solvent&#8208;free mechanically induced Wittig olefination under ambient conditions often without the need of ylide pre&#8208;formation with a 30&#8197;seconds reaction time under high&#8208;energy ball milling conditions.







Abstract
30&#8197;Seconds to success!&#8212;The Wittig reaction, a fundamental and extensively utilized reaction in organic chemistry, enables the efficient conversion of carbonyl compounds to olefins using phosphonium salts. Traditionally, meticulous reaction setup, including the pre&#8208;formation of a reactive ylide species via deprotonation of a phosphonium salt, is crucial for achieving high&#8208;yielding reactions under classical solution&#8208;based conditions. In this report, we present an unprecedented protocol for an ultra&#8208;fast mechanically induced Wittig reaction under solvent&#8208;free and ambient conditions, often eliminating the need for tedious ylide pre&#8208;formation under strict air and moisture exclusion. A range of aldehydes and ketones were reacted with diverse phosphonium salts under high&#8208;energy ball milling conditions, frequently giving access to the respective olefins in only 30&#8197;seconds.

         <title>Exploring Aqueous Solution&#8208;Processed Pseudohalide Rare&#8208;Earth Double Perovskite Ferroelectrics toward X&#8208;Ray Detection with High Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first high&#8208;temperature hybrid pseudohalide rare&#8208;earth double perovskite (HPREDP) ferroelectric was obtained by rationally designed. Further, we explored application of HPREDP ferroelectric in X&#8208;ray detection, and achieved the highest sensitivity of 1307&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (among all hybrid double perovskite ferroelectric detectors).







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) pseudohalide rare&#8208;earth double perovskites (PREDPs) have garnered significant attention for their versatile physical properties, including ferroelectricity, ferroelasticity, large piezoelectric responses, and circularly polarized luminescence. However, their potential for X&#8208;ray detection remains unexplored, and the low Curie temperature (TC) limits the performance window for PREDP ferroelectrics. Here, by applying the chemical regulation strategies involving halogen substitution on the organic cation and Rb/Cs substitution to the PREDP [(R)&#8208;M3HQ]2RbEu(NO3)6 [(R)&#8208;M3HQ=(R)&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxylquinuclidinium] with a low TC of 285&#8197;K, a novel 3D PREDP ferroelectric [(R)&#8208;CM3HQ]2CsEu(NO3)6 [(R)&#8208;CM3HQ=(R)&#8208;N&#8208;chloromethyl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxylquinuclidinium] are successfully synthesized, for which the TC reaches 344&#8197;K. More importantly, such a strategy endowed [(R)&#8208;CM3HQ]2CsEu(NO3)6 with notable X&#8208;ray detection capabilities. Centimeter&#8208;sized [(R)&#8208;CM3HQ]2CsEu(NO3)6 single crystals fabricated from aqueous solutions demonstrated a sensitivity of 1307&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a low detectable dose rate of 152&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, the highest sensitivity reported for hybrid double perovskite ferroelectric detectors. This work positions PREDPs as promising candidates for the next generation of eco&#8208;friendly optoelectronic materials and also offers substantial insights into the interaction between structure, composition, and functionality in ferroelectric materials.

         <title>Brush&#8208;Like Polymeric Gels Enabled Photonic Crystals toward Ultrasensitive Cosolvent Chromism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brush&#8208;like polymeric photonic gel (BPPG) was constructed by using the assembled ZnS@SiO2 nanoparticles as a photonic crystal template and in situ polymerizing oligo ethylene glycol acrylate. Owing to the cosolvency&#8208;induced incremental stretching of acrylate backbones and polyethylene glycol side&#8208;chains in ethanol&#8208;water mixtures, the prepared BPPG exhibited sensitive chromatic responses within ethanol&#8208;rich concentrations.







Abstract
Responsive photonic crystals (RPCs) exhibit dynamic chromism upon trigger by various solvents, showing potential applications in qualitative identification and quantitative analysis of multicomponent solvents. However, distinguishing similar solvents, especially traces of cosolvents, remains challenging due to the limited sensitivity of RPCs. To address this, we herein introduce brush&#8208;like polymeric gels inside photonic crystals, forming a brush&#8208;like polymeric photonic gel (BPPG) that can trace tiny component changes. In this BPPG system, the acrylate backbones and polyethylene glycol (PEG) side&#8208;chains stretch incrementally due to the cosolvency of ethanol&#8208;water mixtures, resulting in highly sensitive chromatic responses within ethanol&#8208;rich concentrations. With water content varying slightly from 0 to 1&#8197;vol&#8201;%, the reflection wavelength of BPPG can sharply redshift over 30&#8197;nm, leading to very noticeable changes in structural color. This enhanced sensitivity makes BPPG suitable for real&#8208;time, in situ purity monitoring of absolute ethanol during storage, transportation, and other applications.

         <title>Atomic Printing Strategy Achieves Precise Anchoring of Dual&#8208;Copper Atoms on C2N Structure for Efficient CO2 Reduction to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully develop a universal atomic imprinting synthesis strategy for the preparation of dual&#8208;atom catalysts, with a particular focus on the synthesis of a dual&#8208;atom Cu catalyst for the electrochemical CO2 reduction to ethylene. The dual&#8208;atom copper catalyst developed in this research exhibits impressive electrocatalytic performance, achieving a remarkable 71.7&#8201;% ethylene Faradaic efficiency at an applied potential of &#8722;1.1&#8197;V vs RHE.







Abstract
Isolated metal sites catalysts (IMSCs) play crucial role in electrochemical CO2 reduction, with potential industrial applications. However, tunable synthesis strategies for IMSCs are limited. Herein, we present an atomic printing strategy that draws inspiration from the ancient Chinese &#8220;movable&#8208;type printing technology&#8221;. Selecting customizable combinations of metal atoms as metal precursors from an extensive binuclear metal library.

&lt;p&gt;We successfully develop a universal atomic imprinting synthesis strategy for the preparation of dual-atom catalysts, with a particular focus on the synthesis of a dual-atom Cu catalyst for the electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to ethylene. The dual-atom copper catalyst developed in this research exhibits impressive electrocatalytic performance, achieving a remarkable 71.7&#8201;% ethylene Faradaic efficiency at an applied potential of &#8722;1.1&#8197;V &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt; RHE.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isolated metal sites catalysts (IMSCs) play crucial role in electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, with potential industrial applications. However, tunable synthesis strategies for IMSCs are limited. Herein, we present an atomic printing strategy that draws inspiration from the ancient Chinese &#8220;movable-type printing technology&#8221;. Selecting customizable combinations of metal atoms as metal precursors from an extensive binuclear metal library. A series of dual-atom catalysts were prepared by utilizing the edge nitrogen atoms in the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N cavity as anchoring &#8220;pincers&#8221; to capture metal atoms. To prove utility, the dual atom catalyst Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N is investigated as electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR catalyst. The synergistic interaction of dual Cu atoms promotes C&#8722;C coupling and guarantees FE&lt;sub&gt;C2+&lt;/sub&gt; (90.8&#8201;%) and FE&lt;sub&gt;C2H4&lt;/sub&gt;. (71.7&#8201;%) at &#8722;1.10&#8197;V vs RHE. DFT calculations revealed the Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; site would be subtly flipped during CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR for enhancing *CO adsorption and dimerization.

         <title>Quantifying the Hydration&#8208;Dependent Dynamics of Cu Migration and Activity in Zeolite Omega for the Partial Oxidation of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;exchanged zeolite omega's (Cu&#8208;omega) activity in partial methane oxidation via oxygen looping significantly varies with the conditions applied. Using primarily in situ anomalous x&#8208;ray powder diffraction (AXRPD) the source of this divergent behavior is revealed to be due to a migration of Cu throughout the framework, which in turn is predominantly controlled by the system's degree of hydration.







Abstract
Copper&#8208;exchanged zeolite omega (Cu&#8208;omega) is a potent material for the selective conversion of methane&#8208;to&#8208;methanol (MtM) via the oxygen looping approach. However, its performance exhibits substantial variation depending on the operational conditions. Under an isothermal temperature regime, Cu&#8208;omega demonstrates subdued activity below 230&#8201;&#176;C, but experiences a remarkable increase in activity at 290&#8201;&#176;C. Applying a high&#8208;temperature activation protocol at 450&#8201;&#176;C causes a rapid deactivation of the material. This behavioral divergence is investigated by combining reactivity studies, neutron diffraction and in situ high&#8208;resolution anomalous X&#8208;ray powder diffraction (HR&#8208;AXRPD), as well as electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, to reveal that the migration of Cu throughout the framework is the primary cause of these behaviors, which in turn is predominantly governed by the degree of hydration of the system. This work suggests that control over the Cu migration throughout the zeolite framework may be harnessed to significantly increase the activity of Cu&#8208;omega by generating more active sites for the MtM conversion. These results underscore the power of in situ HR&#8208;AXRPD for unraveling the behavior of materials under reaction conditions and suggest that a re&#8208;evaluation of Cu&#8208;zeolites priorly deemed inactive for the MtM conversion across a broader range of conditions and looping protocols may be warranted.

We report the synthesis and properties of four &#960;&#8208;extended, fused fluorene derivatives with high diradical character, taking advantage of a molecular design where the closed&#8208;shell does not include any Clar sextet, comparatively to a maximum of 5 in the corresponding open&#8208;shell state. This led to an unusual open&#8208;shell triplet ground state with an outstanding singlet&#8208;triplet energy difference (&#916;EST) of ca. 19&#8197;kcal/mol, one of the highest values reported to date for an all&#8208;carbon conjugated scaffold.







Abstract
The synthesis of diradical organic compounds has garnered significant attention due to their thermally accessible spin inversion and optoelectronic properties. Yet, preparing such stable structures with high open&#8208;shell behavior remains challenging. Herein, we report the synthesis and properties of four &#960;&#8208;extended, fused fluorene derivatives with high diradical character, taking advantage of a molecular design where the closed&#8208;shell does not include any Clar sextet, comparatively to a maximum of 5 in the corresponding open&#8208;shell state. This led to an unusual open&#8208;shell triplet ground state with an outstanding singlet&#8208;triplet energy difference (&#916;EST) of ca. 19&#8197;kcal/mol, one of the highest values reported to date for an all&#8208;carbon conjugated scaffold. Incorporation of dithiafulvene units at each end of the molecule (at the five&#8208;membered rings) furnishes extended tetrathiafulvalenes (TTFs) undergoing reversible oxidations to the radical cation and diradical dication. The various pro&#8208;aromatic structures presented herein show highly localized spin density and a limited conjugation due to the confined &#960;&#8208;electrons in the aromatic cycles, as supported by 1H NMR, UV/Visible, EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations.

         <title>Measuring Kinetics under Vibrational Strong Coupling: Testing for a Change in the Nucleophilicity of Water and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vibrational Strong Coupling (VSC) is reported to modify chemical reactivity, but its mode of action is not understood. Here, we provide a methodology using fixed&#8208;width optical cavities for measuring kinetics under VSC in a reproducible way. The large kinetic dataset showed that VSC does not substantially alter the nucleophilicity of alcohols.







Abstract
Vibrational Strong Coupling (VSC) has been reported to change the rate of organic reactions. However, a lack of convenient and reliable methods to measure reaction kinetics under VSC makes it challenging to obtain mechanistic insight into its influence, hindering progress in the field. Here, we use recently developed fixed&#8208;width optical cavities to obtain large kinetic datasets under VSC with small errors (&#177;1&#8211;5&#8201;%) in an operationally simple manner using UV/Vis spectroscopy. The setup is used to test whether VSC changes a fundamental kinetic property of polar reactions, nucleophilicity, for water and alcohols, species commonly used in VSC&#8208;modified chemistry. We determined the rate constants for nucleophilic capture with a library of benzhydrilium ions as reference electrophiles with and without strong coupling of the nucleophile's key vibrations. For all investigated combinations of electrophiles and nucleophiles, only minor changes in the observed rate constants of the reactions were observed independently of the coupled bands. These results indicate that VSC does not substantially alter the nucleophilicity of water and alcohols, suggesting that polar reactions are modified through other, presently unknown mechanisms. Fixed&#8208;width cavities allow for convenient and reproducible UV/Vis kinetics, facilitating mechanistic studies of VSC&#8208;modified chemistry.

         <title>Individually Tunable Energy Levels of Oligomers Based on N&#8722;B&#8592;N Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of monodisperse oligomers based on electron&#8208;accepting double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) unit with individually tunable energy levels were developed. This unique energy level tuning is attributed to the separation of LUMO and HOMO at the atomic scale of the BNBP unit and the different contributions of charge transfer transitions in the excited states.







Abstract
Opto&#8208;electronic properties and device performance of organic semiconductors are mainly determined by energy levels of their frontier molecular orbitals, e.g. lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (ELUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (EHOMO) in the ground state, first singlet state (ES1) and first triplet state (ET1) in the excited state. These energy levels are always intricately intertwined. Herein, we report a series of monodisperse oligomers based on double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) units. With the increasing number of repeating units, the oligomers exhibit gradually downshifted ELUMO and nearly unchanged EHOMO due to the different distribution of the frontier molecular orbitals of the oligomers. Moreover, the oligomers exhibit gradually decreasing ES1 and nearly unchanged ET1 because of the different contributions of the charge transfer component in the excited state. This work provides new insight into energy level tuning of organic semiconductors, which is important for high&#8208;performance organic opto&#8208;electronic devices.

&lt;sub&gt;T1&lt;/sub&gt;) in the excited state. These energy levels are always intricately intertwined. Herein, we report a series of monodisperse oligomers based on double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) units. With the increasing number of repeating units, the oligomers exhibit gradually downshifted &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;LUMO&lt;/sub&gt; and nearly unchanged &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;HOMO&lt;/sub&gt; due to the different distribution of the frontier molecular orbitals of the oligomers. Moreover, the oligomers exhibit gradually decreasing &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;S1&lt;/sub&gt; and nearly unchanged &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;T1&lt;/sub&gt; because of the different contributions of the charge transfer component in the excited state. This work provides new insight into energy level tuning of organic semiconductors, which is important for high-performance organic opto-electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing d/p&#8208;2&#960;* Orbitals Hybridization via Strain Engineering for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>

Lattice strain regulates the orbitals hybridization between metal sites and *CO2 as well as *COOH intermediates to achieve rapid conversion of solidly adsorbed CO2 to critical *COOH intermediates, accelerating the overall CO2 reduction kinetics.







Abstract
The photoconversion of CO2 into valuable chemical products using solar energy is a promising strategy to address both energy and environmental challenges. However, the strongly adsorbed CO2 frequently impedes the seamless advancement of the subsequent reaction by significantly increasing the reaction activation energy. Here, we present a BiFeO3 material with lattice strain that collaboratively regulates the d/p&#8208;2&#960;* orbitals hybridization between metal sites and *CO2 as well as *COOH intermediates to achieve rapid conversion of solidly adsorbed CO2 to critical *COOH intermediates, accelerating the overall CO2 reduction kinetics. Quasi in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and in situ Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculation reveals that the optimized Fe sites enhance the adsorption and activation effect of CO2, and continuous internal electrons are rapidly transferred to the reaction sites and injected into the surface *CO2 and *COOH under the condition of illumination, which promotes the rapid formation and stability of *COOH. Certainly, the performance of CO2 photoreduction to CO is improved by 12.81&#8208;fold compared with the base material. This work offers a new perspective for the rapid photoreduction process of strongly adsorbed CO2.

Tryptophan nitration chemistry of an economically impactful heme enzyme, TxtE, has been modeled utilizing synthetic heme mimics by Sam&#8197;P. de&#8197;Visser, Gayan&#8197;B. Wijeratne et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202409430). Therein, spectroscopic and theoretical characterizations strongly suggest the occurrence of a heme peroxynitrite active species, closely paralleling mechanistic propositions put forward for TxtE enzyme. Precise mechanistic details and key structure&#8211;activity relationships present important findings to be implemented in next generation therapeutic and synthetic applications.

Wijeratne et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202409430"&gt;e202409430&lt;/a&gt;). Therein, spectroscopic and theoretical characterizations strongly suggest the occurrence of a heme peroxynitrite active species, closely paralleling mechanistic propositions put forward for TxtE enzyme. Precise mechanistic details and key structure&#8211;activity relationships present important findings to be implemented in next generation therapeutic and synthetic applications.

         <title>Reactivity Inside Molecular Flasks: Acceleration Modes and Types of Selectivity Obtainable</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular flasks are hollow supramolecular structures capable of catalyzing organic reactions, often exhibiting complex catalytic mechanisms and selectivity not achievable in bulk solvent. This Review discusses the different acceleration modes that operate within molecular flasks, and showcases the different types of selectivity that are obtainable through their use, focusing on examples relevant to current challenges in synthetic organic chemistry. We believe this summary will facilitate the design and development of novel catalysis examples inside molecular flasks







Abstract
There is increasing interest in the discovery and application of molecular flasks&#8211;supramolecular host structures capable of catalyzing organic reactions. Reminiscent of enzymes due to possessing a host cavity akin to an active site, molecular flasks can exhibit complex catalytic mechanisms and in many cases provide selectivity not achievable in bulk solvent. In this Review, we aim to organize the increasingly diverse examples through a two&#8208;part structure. In part one, we provide an overview of the different acceleration modes that operate within molecular flasks, while in part two we showcase, through selected examples, the different types of selectivity that are obtainable through the use of molecular flasks. Particular attention is given to examples that are relevant to current challenges in synthetic organic chemistry. We believe that this structure makes the field more approachable and thus will stimulate the development of novel applications of molecular flasks.

         <title>Celebrating Ten Years of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Solar Energy Conversion: Past, Present and Future</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the first report of covalent organic frameworks as photocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 2014, a new type of &#8220;soft photocatalyst&#8221; was released. Here, a historical overview as well as the current state of the art and future perspectives on various photocatalytic reactions including CO2 reduction (CO2RR), overall water splitting, N2 fixation, oxygen reduction (ORR), and alcohol oxidation, are given.







Abstract
Accelerated anthropogenic emission of greenhouse gases due to increasing energy demands has created a negative impact on our planet. Therefore, the replacement of fossil by renewable energy resources has become of paramount interest, both societally and scientifically. It is within this setting that organic photocatalysts have emerged as a new generation of earth&#8208;abundant catalysts for the conversion of solar radiation into chemical energy. In 2014, the first example of a covalent organic framework (COF) photocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction was reported by our group, which has not only marked the beginning of COF photocatalysis for solar fuel production but also helped to accelerate research into &#8220;soft photocatalysis&#8221; based on porous polymers in general. In the last decade, significant progress has been made toward developing COFs as robust, molecularly precise platforms emulating artificial photosynthesis. This mini&#8208;review commemorates the 10th anniversary of COF photocatalysis and gives a brief historical overview of the milestones in the field since its inception in 2014. We review milestones in the development of COFs for solar fuel production and related photocatalytic transformations, including hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, overall water splitting, CO2 reduction, N2 fixation, oxygen reduction, and alcohol oxidation. We discuss lessons learned for the design of structure&#8208;property&#8208;function relationships in COF photocatalysts, and future perspectives and challenges for the field of &#8220;soft photocatalysis&#8221; are given.

         <title>Disorder Over Pore Size: Boosting Supercapacitor Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a recent study, Forse and co&#8208;workers show that structural disorder in nanoporous carbon materials significantly enhances capacitance performance, surpassing traditional factors like pore size and surface area. This discovery provides a new direction for the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density supercapacitors, guiding the design and synthesis of new efficient electrode materials.







Abstract
The urgent need for efficient energy storage systems has spotlighted supercapacitors and nanostructured porous carbon materials. These materials require structural optimization to enhance their performance and lifespan, necessitating advanced design and synthesis techniques. In a recent publication, Forse and co&#8208;workers reveal that structural disorder in nanoporous carbon materials significantly enhances their capacitance performance, suggesting that optimizing structural disorder is key to developing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density supercapacitors. This study innovatively shows that structural disorder in nanoporous carbon materials significantly enhances capacitance performance, surpassing traditional factors like pore size and surface area. The investigation of multiple nanoporous carbons from a range of different suppliers showcases the generalizability of the findings. Annealing treatment further confirms that the capacitance enhancement is due to structural disorder. This discovery guides the design and synthesis of new efficient electrode materials, providing a new direction for the future development of supercapacitors.

         <title>dGAE(297&#8211;391) Tau Fragment Promotes Formation of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy&#8208;Like Tau Filaments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In vitro methods for obtaining disease&#8208;specific filamentous aggregates of the microtubule&#8208;associated protein tau are needed for diagnostics and drug development against tauopathies. We show that the chronic traumatic encephalopathy type II fold can be propagated onto full&#8208;length tau by seeding the aggregation with the tau fragment dGAE. The work brings us closer to in vitro preparation of disease&#8208;specific tau filament types.







Abstract
The microtubule&#8208;associated protein tau forms disease&#8208;specific filamentous aggregates in several different neurodegenerative diseases. In order to understand how tau undergoes misfolding into a specific filament type and to control this process for drug development purposes, it is crucial to study in vitro tau aggregation methods and investigate the structures of the obtained filaments at the atomic level. Here, we used the tau fragment dGAE, which aggregates spontaneously, to seed the formation of full&#8208;length tau filaments. The structures of dGAE and full&#8208;length tau filaments were investigated by magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) solid&#8208;state NMR, showing that dGAE allows propagation of a chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)&#8208;like fold to the full&#8208;length tau. The obtained filaments efficiently seeded tau aggregation in HEK293T cells. This work demonstrates that in vitro preparation of disease&#8208;specific types of full&#8208;length tau filaments is feasible.

         <title>Fused Aromatic and Antiaromatic Smaragdyrin Dimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Singly linked and fused dimers were synthesized for aromatic [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex and antiaromatic [20]smaragdyrin free base. The fused dimers show larger electronic interactions but the respective antiaromatic and aromatic characters are well preserved.







Abstract
Singly&#8208;linked aromatic [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex dimer was synthesized by the reductive coupling of 16&#8208;brominated [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex, which was oxidized to a stable diradical with PbO2. As the first example of fused smaragdyrin dimer, a fused [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex dimer was synthesized by the oxidation of a CuCl&#8208;BF2 complex dimer with FeCl3 and subsequent reduction with NaBH4. After removal of the BF2 group, the singly&#8208;linked and fused aromatic dimers were oxidized to the corresponding antiaromatic [20]smaragdyrin free base dimers. The first oxidation and reduction potentials of these dimers are split depending upon the intramolecular electronic interactions, which are larger for the fused dimers. Despite the large electronic interactions, the aromatic and antiaromatic characters are well preserved in the fused dimers.

         <title>Resonance&#8208;Assisted Self&#8208;Doping in Robust Open&#8208;Shell Ladder&#8208;Type Oligoaniline Analogues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel self&#8208;doping mechanism is introduced in ladder&#8208;type oligoaniline&#8208;derived organic conductors. This mechanism, facilitated by resonance&#8208;assisted proton transfer, enables efficient self&#8208;doping of the organic electronic compound, resulting in a durable conductive material without the need for an external dopant. The findings open new possibilities for creating organic conductors that are both high&#8208;performing and long&#8208;lasting.







Abstract
A novel resonance&#8208;assisted self&#8208;doping mechanism has been demonstrated in ladder&#8208;type oligoaniline&#8208;derived organic conductors. The new class of compounds has a unique structure incorporating acidic phenolic hydroxyl groups into the ladder&#8208;type cyclohexadiene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diimine core, enabling efficient resonance&#8208;assisted proton transfer and electronic doping without the need for external dopants. Mechanistic and computational studies confirm the open&#8208;shell, zwitterionic nature of the self&#8208;doped state and the significant role played by the dielectric environment. This new self&#8208;doping mechanism allows for higher stability and durability in the material&#8216;s electronic performance. The self&#8208;doped form retains durability under harsh conditions and maintains its properties over extended periods of time.

         <title>Mechanistically Different Mechanochromophores Enable Calibration and Validation of Molecular Forces in Glassy Polymers and Elastomeric Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymers with covalently incorporated donor&#8208;acceptor torsional springs allow for real&#8208;time monitoring of forces, that are calibrated using known spiropyran mechanophores. This concept is demonstrated using glassy, entangled polymers and elastomeric networks.







Abstract
Sterically distorted donor&#8208;acceptor &#960;&#8208;systems, termed DA springs, can be progressively planarized under mechanical load causing a bathochromic shift of the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum. By combining theory and experiment, we here use a simple linear force calibration for two different conformational mechanochromophores to determine molecular forces in polymers from the mechanochromic shift in PL wavelength during multiple uniaxial tensile tests. Two systems are used, i) a highly entangled linear glassy polyphenylene and ii) a covalent elastomeric polydimethylsiloxane network. The mean forces estimated by this method are validated using known threshold forces for the mechanochemical ring&#8208;opening reactions of two different spiropyran force probes. The agreement between both approaches underlines that these DA springs provide the unique opportunity for the online monitoring of local molecular forces present in diverse polymer matrices.

         <title>Synthesis and Structural Characterization of a Non&#8208;Heme Iron Hyponitrite Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;Hyponitrite Reactivity: The Fe&#8208;hyponitrite complex 3 was generated from preformed hyponitrite and characterized by spectroscopic methods and X&#8208;ray crystallography. Upon protonation or oxidation, quantitative N2O formation occurs. Lewis acidity of iron plays a key role in reactivity, as a more Lewis acidic iron center leads to the cleavage of the N=N bond of hyponitrite.







Abstract
Flavodiiron NO reductases (FNORs) are important enzymes in microbial pathogenesis, as they equip microbes with resistance to the human immune defense agent nitric oxide (NO). Despite many efforts, intermediates that would provide insight into how the non&#8208;heme diiron active sites of FNORs reduce NO to N2O could not be identified. Computations predict that iron&#8208;hyponitrite complexes are the key species, leading from NO to N2O. However, the coordination chemistry of non&#8208;heme iron centers with hyponitrite is largely unknown. In this study, we report the reactivity of two non&#8208;heme iron complexes with preformed hyponitrite. In the case of [Fe(TPA)(CH3CN)2](OTf)2, cleavage of hyponitrite and formation of an Fe2(NO)2 diamond core is observed. With less Lewis&#8208;acidic [Fe2(BMPA&#8208;PhO)2(OTf)2] (2), reaction with Na2N2O2 in polar aprotic solvent leads to the formation of a red complex, 3. X&#8208;ray crystallography shows that 3 is a tetranuclear iron&#8208;hyponitrite complex, [{Fe2(BMPA&#8208;PhO)2}2(&#956;&#8208;N2O2)](OTf)2, with a unique hyponitrite binding mode. This species provided the unique opportunity to us to study the interaction of hyponitrite with non&#8208;heme iron centers and the reactivity of the bound hyponitrite ligand. Here, either protonation or oxidation of 3 is found to induce N2O formation, supporting the hypothesis that hyponitrite is a viable intermediate in NO reduction.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Lithium Pyrocarbonate (Li2[C2O5]) and Lithium Hydrogen Pyrocarbonate (Li[HC2O5])</title>

Li[HC2O5] is the first hydrogen&#8208;containing pyrocarbonate. It was synthesized by a reaction of CO2 and H2O with Li2[CO3] at moderate pressures and temperatures together with an anhydrous lithium pyrocarbonate (Li2[C2O5]) in a DAC. The crystal structure was determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and confirmed by DFT&#8208;based calculations. The structure refinement and DFT calculations show that in Li[HC2O5] a symmetric hydrogen bond is present in the hydrogenated pyrocarbonate anion [HC2O5]&#8722;.

         <title>An Aza&#8208;Prilezhaev&#8208;Based Method for Inversion of Regioselectivity in Stereospecific Alkene 1,2&#8208;Aminohydroxylations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under acidic conditions (TFA) and in the presence of water, BocNHOTs promotes stereospecific 1,2&#8208;aminohydroxylations of alkenes. The processes involve intermolecular aza&#8208;Prilezhaev aziridination followed by stereospecific SN2&#8208;like opening by water. This reagent combination provides regiochemical outcomes that are opposite to those observed using epoxidation initiation 1,2&#8208;aminohydroxylation protocols. The reaction platform enables other classes of alkene 1,2&#8208;aminofunctionalization, and intramolecular processes are also feasible, including unusual variants that evoke azabicyclobutane reactivity.

         <title>Molecularly Imprinted Polymers for Highly Specific Bioorthogonal Catalysis Inside Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecularly imprinted enzyme mimics (MIEs) containing a copper center and specific substrate binding domain, could perform highly&#8208;specific abiotic transformation inside cells, particularly in a gain&#8208;of&#8208;functions. Importantly, Cu&#8208;MIEs exclusively catalyze target substrates and retain its superb performance even in the presence of copper&#8208;poisoning molecules like glutathione (GSH).







Abstract
Transition metal catalysts (TMCs) mediated bioorthogonal catalysis expand the chemical possibilities within cells. Developing synthetic TMCs tools that emulate the efficiency and specificity of natural metalloenzymes is a rewarding yet challenging endeavor. Here, we highlight the potential of molecularly imprinted enzyme mimics (MIEs) containing a Cu center and specific substrate binding domain, for conducing dimethylpropargyloxycarbonyl (DmProc) cleavage reactions within cells. Our studies reveal that the Cu&#8208;MIEs act as highly specific guides, precisely catalyzing target substrates, even in glutathione (GSH)&#8208;rich cellular environments. By adapting templates similar to the target substrates, we evolved Cu&#8208;MIEs activity to a high level and provided a method to broaden its scope to other unique substrates. This system was applied to a thyroid hormone (T3)&#8208;responsive gene switch model, inducing firefly luciferase expression by T3 in cells. This approach verifies that MIEs effectively rescue DmProc&#8208;bearing T3 prodrugs and seamlessly integrating themself into cellular biocatalytic networks.

Azobenzene&#8208;based photoswitchable inverse agonists of the retinoic acid receptor&#8208;related orphan receptor &#947; (ROR&#947;) enable optical control of gene expression mediated by this important nuclear hormone receptor, with excellent potency and selectivity.







Abstract
Retinoic acid receptor&#8208;related orphan receptor &#947; (ROR&#947;) is a nuclear hormone receptor with multiple biological functions in circadian clock regulation, inflammation, and immunity. Its cyclic temporal role in circadian rhythms, and cell&#8208;specific activity in the immune system, make it an intriguing target for spatially and temporally localised pharmacology. To create tools that can study ROR&#947; biology with appropriate spatiotemporal resolution, we designed light&#8208;dependent inverse ROR&#947; agonists by building azobenzene photoswitches into ligand consensus structures. Optimizations gave photoswitchable ROR&#947; inhibitors combining a large degree of potency photocontrol, with remarkable on&#8208;target potency, and excellent selectivity over related off&#8208;target receptors. This still rare combination of performance features distinguishes them as high quality photopharmaceutical probes, which can now serve as high precision tools to study the spatial and dynamic intricacies of ROR&#947; action in signaling and in inflammatory disorders.

         <title>Hydroaminoalkylation for Amine Functionalization of Vinyl&#8208;Terminated Polyethylene Enables Direct Access to Responsive Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents a novel method for producing functionalized polyethylenes (PEs) via a 100&#8201;% atom economic tantalum&#8208;catalyzed hydroaminoalkylation of vinyl&#8208;terminated polyethylene (VTPE). Our approach addresses current synthetic challenges by enabling the efficient incorporation of amine functionalities into crystalline PEs in the melt phase. These functional materials have diverse potential applications and here we show that aminated PEs exhibit enhanced material properties, and pH responsive properties results in antibacterial PE films.







Abstract
While functionalized polyethylenes (PEs) exhibit valuable characteristics, the constraints of existing synthetic approaches limit the variety of readily incorporated functionality. New methods to generate functionalized PEs are required to afford new applications of this common material. We report 100&#8201;% atom economic tantalum&#8208;catalyzed hydroaminoalkylation of vinyl&#8208;terminated polyethylene (VTPE) as a method to produce amine&#8208;terminated PE. VTPEs with molecular weights between 2200&#8211;16800&#8197;g/mol are successfully aminated using solvent&#8208;free conditions. Our catalytic system is efficient for the installation of both aromatic and aliphatic amines, and can be carried out on multigram scale. The associating amine functional groups afford modified material properties, as measured by water contact angle, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and polymer rheology. The basic amine functionality offers the opportunity to convert inert PE into stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, such that the protonation of aminated PE affords the generation of functional antibacterial PE films.

         <title>Dynamic Asymmetric Diamination of Allylic Alcohols through Borrowing Hydrogen Catalysis: Diastereo&#8208;Divergent Synthesis of Tetrahydrobenzodiazepines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present herein an unprecedented, catalytic enantioconvergent diamination of racemic allylic alcohols with the construction of two C&#8722;N bonds and 1,3&#8208;nonadjacent stereocenters. This iridium/chiral phosphoric acid cooperative catalytic system operates through an atom&#8208;economical borrowing hydrogen amination/aza&#8208;Michael cascade, and converts readily available phenylenediamines and racemic allylic alcohols to 1,5&#8208;tetrahydrobenzodiazepines in high enantioselectivity. An intriguing solvent&#8208;dependent switch of diastereoselectivity was also observed.

         <title>Rapid Thermal Drying Synthesis of Nonthiolated Spherical Nucleic Acids with Stability Rivaling Thiolated DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By thermal drying, highly stable spherical nucleic acids with a high DNA density were synthesized using nonthiolated DNA, rivaling the performance of thiolated DNA. A poly&#8208;adenine block with as few as two consecutive terminal adenine bases is sufficient for anchoring on gold nanoparticles. Applications of nonthiolated SNAs were validated in both solution and paper&#8208;based sensors.







Abstract
Attaching DNA oligonucleotides to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to prepare spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) has offered tremendous insights into surface chemistry with resulting bioconjugates serving as critical reagents in biosensors and nanotechnology. While thiolated DNA is generally required to achieve stable conjugates, we herein communicate that using a thermal drying method, a high DNA density and excellent SNA stability was achieved using nonthiolated DNA, rivaling the performance of thiolated DNA such as surviving 1&#8197;M NaCl, 2 month stability in 0.3&#8197;M NaCl and working in 50&#8201;% serum. A poly&#8208;adenine block with as few as two consecutive terminal adenine bases is sufficient for anchoring on AuNPs. By side&#8208;by&#8208;side comparison with the salt&#8208;aging method, the conjugation mechanism was attributed to competitive adenine adsorption at high temperature along with an extremely high DNA concentration upon drying. Bioanalytical applications of nonthiolated SNAs were validated in both solution and paper&#8208;based sensor platforms, facilitating cost&#8208;effective applications for SNAs.

         <title>Syntheses of Tungsten Imido Cyclohexylidene Complexes Using Perfluoro&#8208;t&#8208;Butanol or Hexafluoro&#8208;t&#8208;Butanol as Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metathesis&#8208;active W(NR)(C6H10)(ORF9)2 (C6H10=cyclohexylidene) complexes are available in three steps (tungsten oxides&#8594;W(NR)2Cl2&#8594;W(NR)2Cy2&#8594;W(NR)(C6H10)(ORF9)2) without making alkylidene intermediates and without using strong acids. The bisnonafluoro&#8208;t&#8208;butoxide alkylidene complexes can be converted readily into bisalkoxide, bispyrrolide, and MAP complexes through nucleophilic substitutions. Cyclohexylidene complexes appear to be more readily prepared than neophylidene complexes, perhaps in part because any cyclohexene complex formed through &#946; hydrogen abstraction is isomerized to a cyclohexylidene complex by RF9OH. This mild acid&#8208;catalyzed approach is an attractive alternative to established syntheses of tungsten neopentylidene or neophylidene imido complexes.







Abstract
The fluorinated alcohols, (CF3)3COH (RF9OH) and (CF3)2MeCOH (RF6OH), react with W(NR)2Cy2 (Cy=Cyclohexyl; R=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl or 1&#8208;adamantyl) in C6D6 at 55&#8201;&#176;C to give cyclohexylidene complexes. Traditional routes to terminal alkylidene complexes (neopentylidene or neophylidene) have used either triflic acid or HCl (rarely), but relatively weak fluorinated acids are sufficient and active bisalkoxide catalysts are therefore prepared directly. An &#945; hydrogen abstraction reaction to give a cyclohexylidene complex from a biscyclohexyl complex appears to be as facile as &#945; hydrogen abstraction to give a neopentylidene or neophylidene ligand, but isomerization of a cyclohexene formed through &#946; hydrogen abstraction is also a possibility. The ORF9 ligands can be replaced readily with dimethylpyrrolide (Me2Pyr) or other more basic alkoxides. Single crystal X&#8208;ray studies were carried out on W(NAr)2Cy2, W(NAr)(ORF9)2(C6H10)(ArNH2), W(NAr)(ORF6)2(C6H10)(ArNH2), W(NAd)(ORF9)2(C6H10)(AdNH2), W(NAr)(O&#8208;i&#8208;PrF6)3Cy, and W(NAd)(&#951;1&#8208;Me2Pyr)2(C6H10) (C6H10=cyclohexylidene).

&lt;p&gt;The fluorinated alcohols, (CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COH (R&lt;sub&gt;F9&lt;/sub&gt;OH) and (CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MeCOH (R&lt;sub&gt;F6&lt;/sub&gt;OH), react with W(NR)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cy&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Cy=Cyclohexyl; R=2,6-diisopropylphenyl or 1-adamantyl) in C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; at 55&#8201;&#176;C to give cyclohexylidene complexes. Traditional routes to terminal alkylidene complexes (neopentylidene or neophylidene) have used either triflic acid or HCl (rarely), but relatively weak fluorinated acids are sufficient and active bisalkoxide catalysts are therefore prepared directly. An &#945; hydrogen abstraction reaction to give a cyclohexylidene complex from a biscyclohexyl complex appears to be as facile as &#945; hydrogen abstraction to give a neopentylidene or neophylidene ligand, but isomerization of a cyclohexene formed through &#946; hydrogen abstraction is also a possibility. The OR&lt;sub&gt;F9&lt;/sub&gt; ligands can be replaced readily with dimethylpyrrolide (Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pyr) or other more basic alkoxides. Single crystal X-ray studies were carried out on W(NAr)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cy&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, W(NAr)(OR&lt;sub&gt;F9&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;)(ArNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), W(NAr)(OR&lt;sub&gt;F6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;)(ArNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), W(NAd)(OR&lt;sub&gt;F9&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;)(AdNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), W(NAr)(O-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-Pr&lt;sub&gt;F6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cy, and W(NAd)(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pyr)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;) (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;=cyclohexylidene).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemically Stable Diazo Peptides as Selective Probes of Cysteine Proteases in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diazo group is an interesting tool in medicinal chemistry and chemical biology due to its selective and versatile reactivity. We show that chemically stable diazo peptides, which even tolerate 95&#8201;% trifluoroacetic acid, can be generated and used as high&#8208;precision chemical tools.







Abstract
Diazo peptides have been described earlier, however, due to their high reactivity have not been broadly used until today. Here, we report the preparation, properties, and applications of chemically stable internal diazo peptides. Peptidyl phosphoranylidene&#8208;esters and amides were found to react with triflyl azide primarily to novel 3,4&#8208;disubstituted triazolyl&#8208;peptides. Nonaflyl azide instead furnished diazo peptides, which are chemically stable from pH&#8197;1&#8211;14 as amides and from pH&#8197;1&#8211;8 as esters. Thus, diazo peptides prepared by solid phase peptide synthesis were stable to final deprotection with 95&#8201;% trifluoroacetic acid. Diazo peptides with the recognition sequence of caspase&#8208;3 were identified as specific, covalent, and irreversible inhibitors of this enzyme at low nanomolar concentrations. A fluorescent diazo peptide entered living cells enabling microscopic imaging and quantification of apoptotic cells via flow cytometry. Thus, internal diazo peptides constitute a novel class of activity&#8208;based probes and enzyme inhibitors useful in chemical biology and medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Specific Optical Control of AMPA Glutamate Receptors with a Photoswitchable Tethered Antagonist</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
AMPA receptors are central to excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain but difficult to control with sufficient precision. We developed MP&#8208;GluAblock, a cell specific light&#8208;controllable AMPAR blocker that consists of a photo&#8208;switchable compound (P) that is targeted to specific cells via an expressed membrane&#8208;anchor protein (M). Our approach could be used to dissect AMPAR signaling with unprecedented cellular and spatiotemporal specificity.







Abstract
AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are the main drivers of excitatory glutamatergic transmission in the brain, central to synaptic plasticity, and are key drug targets. However, AMPARs are expressed in virtually every neuron in the central nervous system and are activated with complex temporal dynamics, making it difficult to determine their functional roles with sufficient precision. Here we describe a cell specific, light&#8208;controllable competitive antagonist for the AMPA receptor called MP&#8208;GluAblock that combines the temporal precision of a photo&#8208;switchable ligand with the spatial and cellular specificity of a genetically&#8208;encoded membrane&#8208;anchor protein. This tool could pave the way for controlling endogenous AMPARs in neural circuits with cellular, spatial, and temporal specificity.

         <title>Electron Deficiency is More Important than Conductivity in C&#8722;N Coupling for Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling from CO2 and nitrate emerges as one of the solutions for direct urea synthesis. In this work, we constructed electron&#8208;deficient Cu sites with electrochemical reduction tolerance by the strong metal&#8208;polymer semiconductor interaction, to boost efficient and durable urea synthesis. The vital role of electron&#8208;deficient Cu in adsorption and C&#8722;N coupling of oxygen&#8208;containing species was disclosed.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling from CO2 and nitrate emerges as one of the solutions for waste upgrading and urea synthesis. In this work, we constructed electron&#8208;deficient Cu sites by the strong metal&#8208;polymer semiconductor interaction, to boost efficient and durable urea synthesis. In situ Raman spectroscopy identified the existence of electron&#8208;deficient Cu sites and was able to withstand electrochemical reduction conditions. Operando synchrotron&#8208;radiation Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations disclosed the vital role of electron&#8208;deficient Cu in adsorption and C&#8722;N coupling of oxygen&#8208;containing species. The electron&#8208;deficient Cu displayed a high urea yield rate of 255.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 at &#8722;1.4&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode and excellent electrochemical durability, superior than that of non&#8208;electron&#8208;deficient counterpart with conductive carbon material as the support. It can be concluded that the regulation of site electronic structure is more important than the optimization of catalyst conductive properties in the C&#8722;N coupling reactions.

         <dc:description>
Remarkable properties have been predicted for cubic graphite, a hypothetical 3D carbon allotrope composed of carbon cages (C48). A sixty carbons fragment of cubic graphite, benzofused (&#945;,&#945;,&#945;)&#8208;tris(tribenzo[8]annulene) (TTBA), was now assembled by K+&#8208;mediated cyclotrimerization of tribenzoCOTyne, that contains 36&#8197;carbon atoms properly arranged in a well&#8208;defined cubic graphite cage (C48).







Abstract
A remarkable stereodivergent cyclotrimerization of 9,10&#8208;didehydrotribenzo[8]annulene (tribenzoCOTyne) to the corresponding (&#945;,&#945;,&#945;)&#8208; and (&#945;,&#945;,&#946;)&#8208;benzofused derivatives has been developed by controlling the reaction conditions. While the K+&#8208;mediated cyclotrimerization afforded the (&#945;,&#945;,&#945;) stereoisomer, using Pd as a catalyst resulted in the (&#945;,&#945;,&#946;)&#8208;derivative. Both stereoisomers were evidenced by spectroscopic data and crystal X&#8208;Ray analysis. The (&#945;,&#945;,&#945;) stereoisomer is a fragment of cubic graphite (CG), an elusive 3D carbon allotrope that contains carbon cages, since all of its sixty carbons are part of the structure of CG, and 36&#8197;constitute a part of the C48 molecular cage of CG. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies revealed that the potassium ion would play a key role as a template to favor the formation of the (&#945;,&#945;,&#945;) stereoisomer.

         <title>Structure Prediction and Computational Protein Design for Efficient Biocatalysts and Bioactive Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to predict and design protein structures has led to numerous applications in medicine, diagnostics and sustainable chemical manufacture. In addition, the wealth of predicted protein structures advances our understanding about how life&#8217;s molecules function and interact. Honouring the work that has fundamentally changed the way scientists research and engineer proteins, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2024 was awarded to David Baker for computational protein design and jointly to Demis Hassabis and John Jumper, who developed AlphaFold for machine&#8208;learning based protein structure prediction. Here, we highlight notable contributions to the development of these computational tools and their importance for the design of functional proteins that are applied in organic synthesis. Importantly, both technologies also have a profound impact on drug discovery as any therapeutic protein target can now be modelled allowing the de novo design of &#160; &#160;peptide binders or the identification of small molecule ligands through the in silico docking of large compound libraries. Looking ahead, we highlight future research directions in protein engineering, medicinal chemistry and material design enabled by this transformative shift in protein science.</dc:description>

         <title>Switching Residues: A Platform for the Synthesis of Fidaxomicin Antibiotics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peripheral modification is often the main approach to optimize natural products for improved biological activity or desired physicochemical properties. This procedure inevitably increases molecular weight, often accompanied by undesired increased lipophilicity. Removing structural elements from natural products is not always tolerated. This is also the case for the antibiotic fidaxomicin (Fdx), where every structural component has been shown to be crucial for antibiotic activity. In this work, we demonstrate how the residue switching approach can maintain biological activity of Fdx derivatives by replacing the rhamnoside&#8208;dichlorohomoorsellinate moiety of Fdx with smaller, more polar building blocks. We used palladium&#8208;catalysed allylic substitution to selectively install&#160;N&#8208;nucleophiles on the core of Fdx. The new derivatives were designed to mimic the binding of Fdx to the bacterial RNA polymerase. Evaluation against&#160;Mycobacterium tuberculosis,&#160;Clostridioides difficile, and the Gram&#8208;negative model organism&#160;Caulobacter crescentus&#160;demonstrated that the newly introduced residues can restore antibiotic activity, which was further supported by on&#8208;target RNA polymerase assays. We combined the allylic substitution with an organocatalysed novioside acylation protocol to enable the functionalisation of two vectors on Fdx in one pot. This platform greatly expands the accessible chemical space for Fdx derivatives and enables the future development of systemic Fdx antibiotics.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling the Configuration Modulation in Spiro&#8208;based Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials hold promise for optoelectronic applications. Among various design strategies, through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) systems offer the potential for enhanced performance. However, the relationship between molecular configuration and TSCT properties remains unclear compared to traditional through&#8208;band charge transfer materials. In this study, we investigated the influence of spatial configuration on TSCT features and electronic properties of triplet excited states in these TSCT materials. By manipulating the spatial arrangement between donor and acceptor segments using different spiro skeletons, a series of TSCT materials (DMB2&#8208;DMB5) was synthesized. Together with the parent molecule, DM&#8208;B, these materials exhibited completely different TADF characteristics, demonstrating the impact of spatial arrangements on their optoelectronic properties. Thus, the external quantum efficiency of these materials ranged from as high as 28.0% (DMB2) to as low as 3.6% (DMB5) due to variations in their TADF characteristics. Our findings highlight the significance of spatial configuration, beyond distance alone, in influencing TSCT properties when donor and acceptor segments are sufficiently close. This insight provides valuable guidance for developing advanced TSCT materials and advancing TADF systems with improved performance and functionality.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) suffer from sluggish kinetics, large volume change, and limited specific capacity due to the large radius of Na+. These issues can be solved through using covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as electrodes. Herein, an azatriangulenetrione&#8208;containing COF (denoted as CityU&#8208;33) was designed and synthesized as an electrode material for SIBs. Due to its inherent abundance of multiple redox&#8208;active sites and fast intercalation kinetics, CityU&#8208;33 delivered a high discharge capacity of 410.4 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8208;1 and showed remarkable long&#8208;term cycling stability, where a discharge capacity of 313 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.2 A g&#8208;1 with approximately 100% retention over 1700 cycles was achieved, making it the top COF electrode material for SIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Allosteric CDC37 inhibitor disrupts chaperone complex to block CDK4/6 maturation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cell division cycle 37 (CDC37) is a member of the molecular chaperone family and acts as a cochaperone of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), which is overexpressed in many cancer types as a regulator of protein kinase maturation. In this process, CDC37 selectively recognizes and stabilizes protein kinases by forming a HSP90&#8208;CDC37&#8208;kinase chaperone complex. The protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs) of HSP90&#8208;CDC37 and CDC37&#8208;kinase complexes contribute to malignant tumors, as oncogenic kinases in malignant cells depend upon CDC37 expression. Thus, inhibiting CDC37 to disrupt HSP90&#8208;CDC37&#8208;kinase chaperone complex reveals as a promising way to achieve selective inhibition of oncogenic kinase maturation. Herein, we report a small&#8208;molecule CDC37 inhibitor called DDO&#8208;6079 that simultaneously inhibits HSP90&#8208;CDC37 and CDC37&#8208;CDK4/6 chaperone complex by binding to an allosteric site on CDC37. DDO&#8208;6079 selectively inhibited the maturation of multiple oncogenic kinases to escape heat shock response (HSR). Furthermore, DDO&#8208;6079 decreased the thermostability of CDK6, reversed the resistance of CDK6 to palbociclib (a successful CDK4/6 inhibitor) in colorectal cancer cells and exhibited efficacy in vivo. Together, the results revealed that DDO&#8208;6079 is a first&#8208;in&#8208;class small molecule CDC37 inhibitor that disrupts the HSP90&#8208;CDC37&#8208;kinase chaperone complex and provides a new way to block kinase maturation.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cell division cycle 37 (CDC37) is a member of the molecular chaperone family and acts as a cochaperone of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), which is overexpressed in many cancer types as a regulator of protein kinase maturation. In this process, CDC37 selectively recognizes and stabilizes protein kinases by forming a HSP90-CDC37-kinase chaperone complex. The protein-protein interactions (PPIs) of HSP90-CDC37 and CDC37-kinase complexes contribute to malignant tumors, as oncogenic kinases in malignant cells depend upon CDC37 expression. Thus, inhibiting CDC37 to disrupt HSP90-CDC37-kinase chaperone complex reveals as a promising way to achieve selective inhibition of oncogenic kinase maturation. Herein, we report a small-molecule CDC37 inhibitor called DDO-6079 that simultaneously inhibits HSP90-CDC37 and CDC37-CDK4/6 chaperone complex by binding to an allosteric site on CDC37. DDO-6079 selectively inhibited the maturation of multiple oncogenic kinases to escape heat shock response (HSR). Furthermore, DDO-6079 decreased the thermostability of CDK6, reversed the resistance of CDK6 to palbociclib (a successful CDK4/6 inhibitor) in colorectal cancer cells and exhibited efficacy in vivo. Together, the results revealed that DDO-6079 is a first-in-class small molecule CDC37 inhibitor that disrupts the HSP90-CDC37-kinase chaperone complex and provides a new way to block kinase maturation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reversible and Ultrasensitive Detection of Nitric Oxide Using a Conductive Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper describes the use of a highly crystalline conductive 2D copper3(hexaiminobenzene)2 (Cu3(HIB)2) as an ultrasensitive (limit of detection of 1.8 part&#8208;per&#8208;billion), highly selective, reversible, and low power chemiresistive sensor for nitric oxide (NO) at room temperature. The Cu3(HIB)2&#8208;based sensors retain their sensing performance in the presence of humidity, and exhibit strong signal enhancement towards NO over other highly toxic reactive gases, such as NO2, H2S, SO2, NH3, CO, as well as CO2. Mechanistic investigations of the Cu3(HIB)2&#8208;NO interaction through spectroscopic analyses and density functional theory revealed that the Cu&#8208;bis(iminobenzosemiquinoid) moieties serve as the binding sites for NO sensing, while the Ni&#8208;bis(iminobenzosemiquinoid) MOF analog shows no noticeable response to NO. Overall, these findings provide a significant leap in the development of crystalline metal&#8208;bis(iminobenzosemiquinoid) based conductive 2D MOFs as highly sensitive, selective, and reversible sensing materials for the low&#8208;power detection of highly toxic gases.</dc:description>

         <title>Bottom&#8208;up Synthesis of Piezoelectric Covalent Triazine&#8208;based Nanotube for Hydrogen Peroxide Production from Water and Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are nanoscale tubular materials with superior mechanical strength and electronic properties. However, the conventional CNTs are inherently non&#8208;piezoelectric, mainly due to the lack of polar structures with pure carbon elements. The direct synthesis of fully conjugated and polarized organic nanotubes with desired piezoelectric properties remains a challenge. Herein, we report the bottom&#8208;up synthesis of a new type of covalent triazine&#8208;based nanotube (CTN&#8208;1) as a novel piezoelectric material. The CTN&#8208;1 comprises of high surface area, nitrogen&#8208;rich and fully conjugated structure, which provides a series of merits for piezoelectric catalytic processes. These structural features combined with one&#8208;dimensional tubular morphology endow CTN&#8208;1 with excellent mechanical stimuli response and thus displaying prominent piezoelectric properties via pronounced nanocurvature effect. We further show that the CTN&#8208;1 enables the efficient synthesis of H2O2 from water in the air via mechanical energy conversion, with an excellent piezocatalytic H2O2 evolution rate of 4115 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, which exceeds all other reported piezoelectric materials. The piezocatalysis by the CTN&#8208;1 can be practically integrated into a self&#8208;Fenton system, which exhibits excellent pollutant degradation capability. This work demonstrates the enormous potential of a new type of piezoelectric synthetic nanotube from organic frameworks for the in&#8208;situ synthesis valuable chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>On&#8208;site Portable Lithium Detection in Mining and Recycling Industries based on a DNAzyme Fluorescent Sensor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The global demand for lithium has soared in recent years due to the wide use of lithium batteries. To meet this demand, we herein report developing novel on&#8208;site sample preparation methods for the extraction of Li+ from relevant materials, including brine water, spodumene rock, and lithium&#8208;ion battery electrodes, and a DNAzyme&#8208;based fluorescent sensor for sensitive and robust detection of Li+ in these samples down to 1.4 mM (10 ppm) using a portable fluorometer. The system can distinguish key threshold lithium levels that indicate economic value across several industries, including 200 ppm Li+ for brine mining, 6% Li2O or SC6 for rock mining, and Li+&#8208;specific aging in LIBs. The methods developed and demonstrated in this work will allow highly selective, on&#8208;site, portable detection of lithium in both environmental samples to identify new lithium resources and in battery electrodes to guide recycling strategies in order to meet the global demand for lithium.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Tuning Metallic Sites in Molecular Complexes for Efficient Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic hybrid catalysts with highly tunable single&#8208;sites are promising for oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER), but molecular&#8208;scale understanding of underlying reaction mechanisms still remain elusive on these bulk materials. Herein, we report a direct construction of heterogenized molecular complexes stabilized on carbon substrates via coordinating Fe&#8208;Ni sites with four aromatic carboxylate ligands (FeNi&#8208;Lx). The ligands&#8208;tuning &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interaction between aromatic carboxylate ligands and carbon supports promote the oxidative charge accumulation on Fe&#8208;Ni sites via fast electron transferring, thus the optimized FeNi&#8208;Lx rendering a mass activity of 6680 A gFe/Ni&#8208;1 at 0.3 V overpotential. In situ characteristics and theoretical analysis demonstrate that the OH&#8208; nucleophilic attack on hypervalent iron sites induce the reconstruction of active Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Ni species, accompanying with fast valence increasing. Whereas, during OER, the unexpected valence reduction of Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Ni sites would be attributed to the oxygen&#8208;generating from OOH* intermediates. These findings would establish an essential understanding of the origin of active centers in molecular complexes catalysts for oxygen&#8208;evolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Ru0.1Mn0.9Ox Electrocatalyst for Durable Oxygen Evolution in Acid Seawater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, direct electrolysis of seawater for green hydrogen production is primarily focused on neutral and alkaline systems. However, the precipitation of calcium and magnesium ions restricts the advancement of this technology. An acidic system can effectively address this issue. Given that Ru/Ir&#8208;based catalysts with high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity also exhibit high chlorine evolution reaction (CER) activity, acid seawater splitting requires anodes with higher selectivity and stability compared to the other two systems. In this study, we propose a non&#8208;precious Ru0.1Mn0.9Ox as the active anode for direct acid seawater electrolysis, which exhibits a high OER selectivity and remarkable stability for more than 1200 hours. Different from the Cl&#8208;&#8208;free system, *Cl occupied on Ru sites could shift the OER active center to Mn on Ru0.1Mn0.9Ox, which prevents the lattice oxygen consumed on Ru and hinders the metal site dissolution. As the CER&#8208;insensitive catalytic center, Mn activated by the introduction of Ru can adsorb a substantial amount of *OH, creating an OER&#8208;favored local environment that inhibits CER. We introduce Cl&#8208;&#8208;assisted transfer of OER active sites to CER&#8208;insensitive Mn as a fundamental strategy for achieving highly selective and durable oxygen evolution in acidic seawater.</dc:description>

         <title>Benzylic C(sp3)&#8211;H Phosphonylation via Dual Photo and Copper Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkyl phosphonates are important motifs in medicinal chemistry, yet their efficient synthesis by direct C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization remains a challenge. Here, we report straightforward access to benzylic phosphonates by direct C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization in a cross&#8208;dehydrogenative&#8208;coupling reaction between non&#8208;specialized alkylarenes and unfunctionalized phosphites. Notably, the C&#8211;H substrates are used as the limiting reagents. The scope of benzylic C&#8211;H substrates is broad, and the mild reaction conditions allow for good functional group tolerance.

Here, we report straightforward access to benzylic phosphonates by direct C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization in a cross-dehydrogenative-coupling reaction between non-specialized alkylarenes and unfunctionalized phosphites. Notably, the C&#8211;H substrates are used as the limiting reagents. The scope of benzylic C&#8211;H substrates is broad, and the mild reaction conditions allow for good functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction proceeds via a radical pathway rather than the cationic pathway followed for specialized benzylic C&#8211;H substrates in previous methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nano&#8208;springe Enriched Hierarchical Porous MOP/COF Hybrid Aerogel: Efficient Recovery of Gold from Electronic Waste</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Extraction of gold from secondary resources such as electronic waste (e&#8208;waste) has become crucial in recent times to compensate for the gradual scarcity of the noble metal in natural mines. However, designing and synthesizing a suitable material for highly efficient gold recovery is still a great challenge. Herein, we have strategically designed rapid fabrication of an ionic crystalline hybrid aerogel by covalent threading of an amino&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;organic polyhedra with an imine&#8208;linked chemically stable covalent organic framework at ambient condition. The hierarchically porous ultra&#8208;light aerogel featuring imine&#8208;rich backbone, high surface area, and cationic sites have shown fast removal, high uptake capacity (2349 mg/g), and excellent selectivity towards gold sequestration. Besides, the aerogel can extract ultra&#8208;trace gold&#8208;ions from different terrestrial water bodies, aiming towards safe drinking water. This study demonstrates the great potential of the composite materials based on a novel approach to designing a hybrid porous material for efficient gold recovery from complex water matrices.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;adaptive Coordination Evolution Mediated Pore&#8208;Space&#8208;Partition in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Boosting SF6/N2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The controllable and precise structural regulation of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) based on isoreticular chemistry is an effective strategy for creating functional material platforms, such as efficient porous adsorbents. Herein, for the first time, mediated by an unprecedented self&#8208;adaptive coordination evolution (SACE) on pseudo&#8208;D2h&#8208;symmetric [M4(&#956;3&#8208;O)2(COO)6] (M = Mn/Fe) clusters, two pore space partitioned MOFs (CTGU&#8208;47&#8208;Mn/Fe, CTGU = China Three Gorges University) have been successfully constructed. Owing to the more confined adsorption space and dense binding sites produced by pore space partitioning (PSP), the CTGU&#8208;47&#8208;Mn/Fe exhibit significantly enhanced performance in the capture or recovery SF6 (greenhouse/electronic specialty gas) &#160;from &#160;SF6/N2 mixture compared to their non&#8208;partitioned homologous structures (CTGU&#8208;46&#8208;Mn/Fe) with adsorption selectivity increased from 37/72 to 634/157 (v/v, 10/90, 100 kPa). The theoretical calculations also elucidated that the implementation of PSP within CTGU&#8208;47&#8208;Mn/Fe leads to dramatically strengthened binding affinity for SF6 over N2 through extra multiple F&#183;&#183;&#183;H interactions.

         <title>Electrolyte Engineering to Construct Robust Interphase with High Ionic Conductivity for Wide Temperature Range Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional electrolyte incorporating 1,3&#8208;propanesultone additive has been developed to form a highly ion&#8208;conductive and robust cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI) and solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI). This innovation significantly enhances the performance and stability of lithium metal batteries in wide temperature range from &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C to 60&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Unstable interphase formed in conventional carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes significantly hinders the widespread application of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with high&#8208;capacity nickel&#8208;rich layered oxides (e.g., LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2, NCM811) over a wide temperature range. To balance ion transport kinetics and interfacial stability over wide temperature range, herein a bifunctional electrolyte (EAFP) tailoring the electrode/electrolyte interphase with 1,3&#8208;propanesultone as an additive was developed. The resulting cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase with an inorganic inner layer and an organic outer layer possesses high mechanical stability and flexibility, alleviating stress accumulation and maintaining the structural integrity of the NCM811 cathode. Meanwhile, the inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase inhibits electrolyte side reactions and facilitates fast Li+ transport. As a result, the Li||Li cells exhibit stable performance in extensive temperatures with low overpotentials, especially achieving a long lifespan of 1000&#8197;h at 30&#8201;&#176;C. Furthermore, the optimized EAFP is also suitable for LiFePO4 and LiCO2 cathodes (1000&#8197;cycles, retention: 67&#8201;%). The Li||NCM811 and graphite||NCM811 pouch cells with lean electrolyte (g/Ah grade) operate stably, verifying the broad electrode compatibility of EAFP. Notably, the Li||NCM811 cells can operate in wide climate range from &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C to 60&#8201;&#176;C. This work establishes new guidelines for the regulation of interphase by electrolytes in all&#8208;weather LMBs.

         <title>Highly Enantioselective Transportation Across Liquid Membranes Mediated by Porous Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This first report of using chiral covalent organic frameworks (CCOFs) as enantioselective carriers in bulk liquid membranes (BLMs) shows that CCOFs enhance the efficiency and enantioselectivity of amino acid separation. Exfoliating CCOFs into nanosheets creates flexible layers with accessible sites, enabling the separation of chiral drug enantiomers unattainable with the pristine CCOFs.







Abstract
Chiral liquid membrane separation is crucial in pharmaceuticals and chemical synthesis for its simplicity and stability, yet designing membrane carriers that enable efficient enantioseparation remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrated for the first time that chiral porous materials can act as mobile carriers of bulk liquid membranes (BLMs) to enhance enantioselective transport and separation. We design and prepare three 2D chiral covalent organic frameworks (CCOFs) by imine condensations of a chiral dialdehyde with triamines containing ethyl, fluorine and/or isopropyl groups. These isostructural CCOFs feature ABC stacking, excellent water, acid and base tolerance, and chiral amine groups in 1D porous channels, promoting efficient enantioselective transportation of amino acid enantiomers. Among them, the CCOF with both &#8208;F and &#8208;iPr groups showing superior transport performance. Exfoliating the CCOF into chiral nanosheets creates flexible layers with accessible active sites, enabling nanosheet&#8208;mediated liquid membranes to separate chiral drug enantiomers, a feat unattainable with the pristine CCOF. This work establishes CCOFs as a promising platform for chiral BLM separations and will guide the design of high&#8208;performance BLMs using porous materials for enantioselective separation.

         <title>Internal Electron&#8208;Donation Allocation Design for Intrinsic Solubilization of Lithium Nitrate in Ester Electrolyte for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The local negative charge density of carbonyl oxygen atoms in carbonate molecules is enhanced by the introduction of electron donors, which makes it easier to coordinate with Li+. This greatly weakens the interaction between Li+ and NO3&#8722;, increasing the solubility of LiNO3 in the ester&#8208;based electrolyte to more than 0.5&#8197;M. The Li|| LiFePO4 batteries with such electrolyte exhibit superior electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) have become a hot topic in the research of next&#8208;generation advanced battery technology due to their high specific energy. However, the high reaction activity between lithium metal and electrolyte is considered one of the key bottlenecks limiting large&#8208;scale applications of LMBs. As a classic electrolyte additive, lithium nitrate (LiNO3) significantly improves the stability of lithium metal in ether&#8208;based electrolytes. However, its solubility in carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes widely used in lithium&#8208;ion batteries is extremely low, causing limited protective capability on lithium metal, which has become a key obstacle to the commercial application of lithium metal batteries. Here, we enhanced the local negative charge density of carbonyl oxygen atoms in carbonate molecules by introducing electron donors, making it easier for them to coordinate with Li+, thereby weakening the interaction between Li+ and NO3&#8722;, and significantly increasing the solubility of LiNO3 in ester electrolytes. The modified ester solvent promotes the derivatization and decomposition of salt anions, leading to the formation of a dense SEI layer rich in LiF and LiNxOy. This significantly improves the stability of lithium metal in ester&#8208;based electrolytes. The assembled Li||Li symmetric battery shows excellent cycling performance of over 4000&#8197;hours.

As a classic electrolyte additive, lithium nitrate (LiNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) significantly improves the stability of lithium metal in ether-based electrolytes. However, its solubility in carbonate-based electrolytes widely used in lithium-ion batteries is extremely low, causing limited protective capability on lithium metal, which has become a key obstacle to the commercial application of lithium metal batteries. Here, we enhanced the local negative charge density of carbonyl oxygen atoms in carbonate molecules by introducing electron donors, making it easier for them to coordinate with Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, thereby weakening the interaction between Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, and significantly increasing the solubility of LiNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in ester electrolytes. The modified ester solvent promotes the derivatization and decomposition of salt anions, leading to the formation of a dense SEI layer rich in LiF and LiN&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;. This significantly improves the stability of lithium metal in ester-based electrolytes. The assembled Li||Li symmetric battery shows excellent cycling performance of over 4000&#8197;hours.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
