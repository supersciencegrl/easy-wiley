         <title>Amphiphilic Heterografted Molecular Bottlebrushes with Tertiary Amine&#8208;Containing Side Chains as Efficient and Robust pH&#8208;Responsive Emulsifiers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By combining the unique characteristics of molecular bottlebrushes (MBBs) and the properties of stimuli&#8208;responsive polymers, we show that MBBs with randomly grafted poly(n&#8208;butyl acrylate) and pH&#8208;responsive poly(2&#8208;(N,N&#8208;diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDEAEMA) side chains are efficient and robust pH&#8208;responsive emulsifiers. Water&#8208;in&#8208;toluene emulsions were formed at pH 4.0 and disrupted by increasing the pH to 10.0. The emulsion generation and disruption was reversible over the ten cycles investigated, and the bottlebrushes remained intact. The exceptional emulsion stability stemmed from the high interfacial binding energy of MBBs, imparted by their large molecular size and Janus architecture at the interface, as evidenced by the interfacial jamming and wrinkling of the assemblies upon reducing the interfacial area. At pH 10.0, PDEAEMA became water&#8208;insoluble, and the MBBs desorbed from the interface, causing de&#8208;emulsification. Consequently, we have shown that the judicious design of MBBs can generate properties of particle emulsifiers from their large size, while the responsiveness of the MBBs enables more potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoexcitation of Distinct Divalent Palladium Complexes in Cross&#8208;Coupling Amination Under Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of metal complexes that function as both photocatalyst and cross&#8208;coupling catalyst remains a challenging research topic. So far, progress has been shown in Pd0 excited&#8208;state transition metal catalysis for the construction of C&#8211;C bonds where the oxidative addition of alkyl/aryl halides to zero&#8208;valent palladium (Pd0) is achievable at room temperature. In contrast, the analogous process with divalent palladium (PdII) is uphill and endothermic. For the first time, we report that divalent PdII can act as a light&#8208;absorbing species that undergoes double excitation to realize C&#8211;N cross&#8208;couplings under air atmosphere. Differently substituted aryl halides can be applied in the mild, and selective cross&#8208;coupling amination using Pd(OAc)2 as both photocatalyst and cross&#8208;coupling catalyst at room temperature. Density functional theory (DFT) studies supported by mechanistic investigations provide insight into the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Discorhabdin V</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discorhabdin natural products are a large subset of pyrroloiminoquinone alkaloids with a myriad of biological activities. Despite garnering much synthetic attention, few members have thus far been completed, particularly those featuring a bridging carbon&#8211;nitrogen bond that is found in numerous discorhabdins, including discorhabdin V. Here we report the first total synthesis and full stereochemical assignment of (+)&#8208;discorhabdin V. To access the pyrroloiminoquinone we developed a convergent N&#8208;alkylation/oxidative aminocyclization/bromination cascade that joins two key components, which are both made on multigram scale. An intramolecular Heck reaction then forms the quaternary carbon center in an intermediate containing the carbon&#8211;nitrogen bridge, and a reductive N,O&#8208;acetal cyclization sequence introduces the final piperidine ring. Furthermore, we have established the relative stereochemistry of (+)&#8208;discorhabdin V through experimental NOESY data and DP4 NMR probability calculations. The absolute configuration of the natural product has also been determined via circular dichroism and the use of an amino acid&#8208;derived chiral starting material. Our work represents one of only two reports of a total synthesis of a nitrogen&#8208;bridged discorhabdin and paves the way for future biological evaluation of such compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>A Single&#8208;Enantiomer Emitter Enabled Superstructural Helix Inversion for Upconverting and Downshifting Luminescence with Bidirectional Circular Polarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single chiral emitter can induce the reversal of the cholesteric helix direction at a macroscopic level through a concentration&#8208;dependent effect at the molecular scale. This exceptional capacity endows the system with the extraordinary ability to seamlessly toggle the sign of circularly polarized luminescence, thus bestowing unparalleled mastery over the upconversion/downshift processes associated with the donor and acceptor moieties. &#8220;A Single&#8208;Enantiomer Emitter Enabled Superstructural Helix Inversion for Upconverting and Downshifting Luminescence with Bidirectional Circular Polarization (Duan and Zhao).&#8221;







Abstract
The helical twisting tendency of liquid crystals (LCs) is generally governed by the inherent configuration of the chiral emitter. Here, we introduce the multistage inversion of supramolecular chirality as well as circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) by manipulating the ratio of single enantiomeric emitters (R&#8208;PCP) to LC monomers (5CB). Increasing the content of R&#8208;PCP from 1&#8197;wt&#8201;% to 3&#8197;wt&#8201;% inverted the helix of LCs from left&#8208;handed to right&#8208;handed, accompanying a CPL sign changed from positive to negative. The biaxiality of chiral emitters, as well as the steric effect of chiral&#8208;chiral and chiral&#8208;achiral interaction, were identified as the reasons for helical sense inversion. Due to the strong helical twisting power, 4&#8197;wt&#8201;% R&#8208;PCP drove the photonic band gap (PBG) of chiral LCs to match up with their emission range, leading to an inversion of the CPL again with a high dissymmetry factor (&#8776;1.2). Directly adjusting the PBG using chiral emitters is seldom achieved in cholesteric LCs. On this basis, an achiral sensitizer PtTPBP was assembled into the helical superstructure. The generation of triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation&#8208;induced upconverted CPL from R&#8208;PCP and the downshifting CPL from PtTPBP with opposite rotation was achieved in a single chiral LC system by tuning the position of the PBG.

         <title>Significant Roles of Surface Hydrides in Enhancing the Performance of Cu/BaTiO2.8H0.2 Catalyst for CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing hydrides into the lattice of BaTiO3 can notably enhance the methanol yield over a supported Cu catalyst in CO2 hydrogenation due to the direct participation of surface hydrides in the reaction and the modified electronic property of the interfacial sites in the Cu/ BaTiO2.8H0.2 catalyst.







Abstract
Tuning the anionic site of catalyst supports can impact reaction pathways by creating active sites on the support or influencing metal&#8208;support interactions when using supported metal nanoparticles. This study focuses on CO2 hydrogenation over supported Cu nanoparticles, revealing a 3&#8208;fold increase in methanol yield when replacing oxygen anions with hydrides in the perovskite support (Cu/BaTiO2.8H0.2 yields ~146&#8197;mg/h/gCu vs. Cu/BaTiO3 yields ~50&#8197;mg/h/gCu). The contrast suggests that significant roles are played by the support hydrides in the reaction. Temperature programmed reaction and isotopic labelling studies indicate that BaTiO2.8H0.2 surface hydride species follow a Mars van Krevelen mechanism in CO2 hydrogenation, promoting methanol production. High&#8208;pressure steady&#8208;state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) studies suggest that Cu/BaTiO2.8H0.2 possesses both a higher density and more active and selective sites for methanol production compared to Cu/BaTiO3. An operando high&#8208;pressure diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS)&#8208;SSITKA study shows that formate species are the major surface intermediates over both catalysts, and the subsequent hydrogenation steps of formate are likely rate&#8208;limiting. However, the catalytic reactivity of Cu/BaTiO2.8H0.2 towards the formate species is much higher than Cu/BaTiO3, likely due to the altered electronic structure of interface Cu sites by the hydrides in the support as validated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Glutathione Mediates Control of Dual Differential Bio&#8208;orthogonal Labelling of Biomolecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical modification at precise sites within biomolecules is essential to assist in understanding their function. The incorporation of bio&#8208;orthogonal reactive groups provides a strategy for selective tagging, however cross&#8208;reactivity is problematic when dual modification is required. Glutathione (GSH) is used to control the reactivity of ynamine and cyclooctyne reagents in sequential (3+2) cycloaddition reactions.







Abstract
Traditional approaches to bio&#8208;orthogonal reaction discovery have focused on developing reagent pairs that react with each other faster than they are metabolically degraded. Glutathione (GSH) is typically responsible for the deactivation of most bio&#8208;orthogonal reagents. Here we demonstrate that GSH promotes a Cu&#8208;catalysed (3+2) cycloaddition reaction between an ynamine and an azide. We show that GSH acts as a redox modulator to control the Cu oxidation state in these cycloadditions. Rate enhancement of this reaction is specific for ynamine substrates and is tuneable by the Cu:GSH ratio. This unique GSH&#8208;mediated reactivity gradient is then utilised in the dual sequential bio&#8208;orthogonal labelling of peptides and oligonucleotides via two distinct chemoselective (3+2) cycloadditions.

         <title>Electrochemical Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Inter&#8208; and Intramolecular Arylations of Cysteine&#8208;Containing Peptides
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical electrochemical Ni&#8208;catalytic system has been developed for selective (hetero)arylation, alkenylation and alkynylation of cysteine&#8208;containing peptides. The high functional group compatibility and application to the synthesis of cyclic peptides either by cyclization or stapling demonstrate the potential protocol's utility in medicinal chemistry and chemical biology.







Abstract
Here we report a simple electrochemical route towards the synthesis of S&#8208;arylated peptides by a site selective coupling of peptides with aryl halides under base free conditions. This approach demonstrates the power of electrochemistry to access both highly complex peptide conjugates and cyclic peptides.

         <title>Parallel Planar Heterojunction Strategy Enables Sb2S3 Solar Cells with Efficiency Exceeding 8&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An easily solution&#8208;processed parallel planar heterojunction (PPHJ) strategy boosts the efficiency of Sb2S3 solar cells up to 8.32&#8201;%, by integrating the distinctive structures of Sb2S3 layer and the duplexity of CH3NH3PbI3 layer in charge transportation. The PPHJ device consists of the conventional planar heterojunction (PHJ) subcells in a parallel connection, but eliminates the normal complexity in both tandem and parallel tandem PHJ systems.







Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed solar cells based on inorganic heterojunctions provide a potential approach to the efficient, stable and low&#8208;cost solar cells required for the terrestrial generation of photovoltaic energy. Antimony trisulfide (Sb2S3) is a promising photovoltaic absorber. Here, an easily solution&#8208;processed parallel planar heterojunction (PPHJ) strategy and related principle are developed to prepare efficient multiple planar heterojunction (PHJ) solar cells, and the PPHJ strategy boosts the efficiency of solution&#8208;processed Sb2S3 solar cells up to 8.32&#8201;% that is the highest amongst Sb2S3 devices. The Sb2S3&#8208;based PPHJ device consists of two kinds of conventional planar heterojunction (PHJ) subcells in a parallel connection: Sb2S3&#8208;based PHJ subcells dominating the absorption and charge generation and CH3NH3PbI3&#8208;based PHJ subcells governing the electron transport towards collection electrode, but it belongs to an Sb2S3 device in nature. The resulting PPHJ device combines together the distinctive structural features of Sb2S3 absorbing layer as a main absorber and the duplexity of well&#8208;crystallized/oriented CH3NH3PbI3 layer in charge transportation as an additional absorber, while the presence of perovskite does not affect device stability. The PPHJ strategy maintains the facile preparation by the conventional sequential depositions of multiple layers, but eliminates the normal complexity in both tandem and parallel tandem PHJ systems.

         <title>Selective CO2 Reduction to Ethylene Mediated by Adaptive Small&#8208;molecule Engineering of Copper&#8208;based Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through in situ tannic acid (TA) molecule regulating the reconstruction of a Cu&#8208;based material, CO2 reduction to C2H4 products with a Faraday efficiency (FE) of 63.6&#8201;% over 497.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was achieved. The excellent performance can be attributed to TA induced adaptive Cu&#948;+/Cu0 interface is beneficial to lower the energy barrier of C&#8722;C coupling, as well as the key COH intermediate stabilized through the hydrogen bond by the hydroxyl group in TA.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) over Cu catalysts exhibits enormous potential for efficiently converting CO2 to ethylene (C2H4). However, achieving high C2H4 selectivity remains a considerable challenge due to the propensity of Cu catalysts to undergo structural reconstruction during CO2RR. Herein, we report an in situ molecule modification strategy that involves tannic acid (TA) molecules adaptive regulating the reconstruction of a Cu&#8208;based material to a pathway that facilitates CO2 reduction to C2H4 products. An excellent Faraday efficiency (FE) of 63.6&#8201;% on C2H4 with a current density of 497.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in flow cell was achieved, about 6.5&#8197;times higher than the pristine Cu catalyst which mainly produce CH4. The in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and Raman studies reveal that the hydroxyl group in TA stabilizes Cu&#948;+ during the CO2RR. Furthermore, theoretical calculations demonstrate that the Cu&#948;+/Cu0 interfaces lower the activation energy barrier for *CO dimerization, and hydroxyl species stabilize the *COH intermediate via hydrogen bonding, thereby promoting C2H4 production. Such molecule engineering modulated electronic structure provides a promising strategy to achieve highly selective CO2 reduction to value&#8208;added chemicals.

         <title>Hydrogenation Catalysis by Hydrogen Spillover on Platinum&#8208;Functionalized Heterogeneous Boronic Acid&#8208;Polyoxometalates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular colloids based on polyoxometalates functionalized with boronic acids are modified with Pt particles to yield high&#8208;performance hydrogenation catalysts. Mechanistic studies reveal that the systems operate by a hydrogen spillover mechanism, enabling efficient hydrogenation of olefins to alkanes and nitroarenes to amines under mild conditions.







Abstract
The activation of molecular hydrogen is a key process in catalysis. Here, we demonstrate how polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based heterogeneous compounds functionalized with Platinum particles activate H2 by synergism between a hydrogen spillover mechanism and electron&#8208;proton transfer by the POM. This interplay facilitates the selective catalytic reduction of olefins and nitroarenes with high functional group tolerance. A family of polyoxotungstates covalently functionalized with boronic acids is reported. In the solid&#8208;state, the compounds are held together by non&#8208;covalent interactions (&#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and hydrogen bonding). The resulting heterogeneous nanoscale particles form stable colloidal dispersions in acetonitrile and can be surface&#8208;functionalized with platinum nanoparticles by in situ photoreduction. The resulting materials show excellent catalytic activity in hydrogenation of olefins and nitrobenzene derivatives under mild conditions (1&#8197;bar H2 and room temperature).

&lt;p&gt;The activation of molecular hydrogen is a key process in catalysis. Here, we demonstrate how polyoxometalate (POM)-based heterogeneous compounds functionalized with Platinum particles activate H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by synergism between a hydrogen spillover mechanism and electron-proton transfer by the POM. This interplay facilitates the selective catalytic reduction of olefins and nitroarenes with high functional group tolerance. A family of polyoxotungstates covalently functionalized with boronic acids is reported. In the solid-state, the compounds are held together by non-covalent interactions (&#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and hydrogen bonding). The resulting heterogeneous nanoscale particles form stable colloidal dispersions in acetonitrile and can be surface-functionalized with platinum nanoparticles by in situ photoreduction. The resulting materials show excellent catalytic activity in hydrogenation of olefins and nitrobenzene derivatives under mild conditions (1&#8197;bar H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and room temperature).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemical Imaging of RNA&#8208;Tau Amyloid Fibrils at the Nanoscale Using Tip&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) is used to map polyadenosine (polyA)&#8208;induced tau fibrils with nanoscale spatial resolution. It proves that polyA lies on the surface of the fibril core &#946;&#8208;sheets but remains wrapped by the random&#8208;coiled fuzzy coat. TERS also shows the colocalization of positively charged amino acids with the anionic polyA cofactor, which is an important step to clarify the role of RNA cofactors in the fibril formation.







Abstract
In the presence of cofactors, tau protein can form amyloid deposits in the brain which are implicated in many neurodegenerative disorders. Heparin, lipids, and RNA are used to recreate tau aggregates in vitro from recombinant protein. However, the mechanism of interaction of these cofactors and the interactions between cofactors and tau are poorly understood. Herein, we use tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) to visualize the spatial distribution of adenine, protein secondary structure, and amino acids (arginine, lysine and histidine) in single polyadenosine (polyA)&#8208;induced tau fibrils with nanoscale spatial resolution (&lt;10&#8211;20&#8197;nm). Based on reference unenhanced and surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectra, we show that the polyA anionic cofactor is incorporated in the fibril structure and seems to be superficial to the &#946;&#8208;sheet core, but nonetheless enveloped within the random&#8208;coiled fuzzy coat. TERS images also prove the colocalization of positively charged arginine, lysine, and histidine amino acids and negatively charged polyA, which constitutes an important step forward to better comprehend the action of RNA cofactors in the mechanism of formation of toxic tau fibrils. TERS appears as a powerful technique for the identification of cofactors in individual tau fibrils and their mode of interaction.

         <title>Naphthyl Substituted Impurities Induce Efficient Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The origin of yellow&#8208;green room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) of triphenylamine from commercial sources has been clarified for the first time, which inspires a general and convenient approach to construct bicomponent host/guest organic RTP materials, that is, doping naphthyl substituted analogues into the host molecule.







Abstract
Accidentally, it was found that triphenylamine (TPA) from commercial sources shows ultralong yellow&#8208;green room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) like commercial carbazole, which however disappears for lab&#8208;synthesized TPA with high purity. Herein, we for the first time identify the impurity types that cause RTP of commercial TPA, which are two N, N&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;naphthylamine isomers. Due to similar molecular polarity and very trace amount (&#8776;0.8&#8197;&#8240;, molar ratio), these naphthyl substituted impurities can be easily overlooked. We further show that even at an extremely low amount (1000000&#8201;:&#8201;1, mass ratio) of impurities, RTP emission is still generated, attributed to the triplet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet energy transfer mechanism. Notably, this doping strategy is also applicable to the triphenylphosphine and benzophenone host systems, of which strong RTP emission can be activated by simply doping the corresponding naphthyl substituted analogues into them. This work therefore provides a general and efficient host/guest strategy toward high performance and diverse organic RTP materials.

         <title>Non&#8208;Interacting Ni and Fe Dual&#8208;Atom Pair Sites in N&#8208;Doped Carbon Catalysts for Efficient Concentrating Solar&#8208;Driven Photothermal CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni&#8722;Fe dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalyst (DSAC) with adjacent Ni&#8722;N4 and Fe&#8722;N4 pair sites was developed for concentrating solar&#8208;driven photothermal CO2 reduction. This work demonstrated that constructing an appropriate distance between Ni and Fe atoms via an N&#8208;bridged Ni&#8722;N&#8722;N&#8722;Fe configuration was conducive to the main *COOH and *HCO3 dissociation processes for solar&#8208;driven photothermal CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion under weak solar irradiation is generally difficult to meet the heat demand of CO2 reduction. Herein, a new concentrated solar&#8208;driven photothermal system coupling a dual&#8208;metal single&#8208;atom catalyst (DSAC) with adjacent Ni&#8722;N4 and Fe&#8722;N4 pair sites is designed for boosting gas&#8208;solid CO2 reduction with H2O under simulated solar irradiation, even under ambient sunlight. As expected, the (Ni, Fe)&#8722;N&#8722;C DSAC exhibits a superior photothermal catalytic performance for CO2 reduction to CO (86.16&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), CH4 (135.35&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and CH3OH (59.81&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), which are equivalent to 1.70&#8208;fold, 1.27&#8208;fold and 1.23&#8208;fold higher than those of the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst, respectively. Based on theoretical simulations, the Fermi level and d&#8208;band center of Fe atom is efficiently regulated in non&#8208;interacting Ni and Fe dual&#8208;atom pair sites with electronic interaction through electron orbital hybridization on (Ni, Fe)&#8722;N&#8722;C DSAC. Crucially, the distance between adjacent Ni and Fe atoms of the Ni&#8722;N&#8722;N&#8722;Fe configuration means that the additional Ni atom as a new active site contributes to the main *COOH and *HCO3 dissociation to optimize the corresponding energy barriers in the reaction process, leading to specific dual reaction pathways (COOH and HCO3 pathways) for solar&#8208;driven photothermal CO2 reduction to initial CO production.

         <title>Stability Investigations on a Pt@HGS Catalyst as a Model Material for Fuel Cell Applications: The Role of the Local pH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of the oxygen reduction reaction in accelerated stress tests using a Pt@HGS model catalyst on the catalyst degradation is investigated using RDE, IL&#8208;STEM grid and single entity electrochemical measurements. We demonstrate the importance of considering the modulation of the local pH when performing accelerated stress tests.







Abstract
Increasing the resistance of catalysts against electrochemical degradation is one of the key requirements for the wider use of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs). Here, we study the degradation of one entity of a highly stable catalyst, Pt@HGS, on a nanoelectrode under accelerated mass transport conditions. We find that the catalyst degrades more rapidly than expected based on previous ensemble measurements. Corroborated by identical location transmission electron microscopy and catalyst layer experiments, we deduce that locally different pH values are likely the reason for this difference in stability. Ultimately, this work provides insights into the actual conditions present in a PEMFC and raises questions about the applicability of accelerated stress tests usually performed to evaluate catalyst stability, particularly when they are performed in half&#8208;cell setups under inert gas.

Different effects have been shown to control the formation of [2]catenanes with different bridges between pyridine donors. The formation of [2&#8208;IL](OTf)4 is aided by solvophobic effects and [3&#8208;IL](OTf)4 is stabilized by solvophobic effects and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking. The &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking between the pyrene groups is essential for the formation of [4&#8208;IL](PF6)4 and [5&#8208;IL](PF6)4, where the enhanced stability of [5&#8208;IL](PF6)4 is based on the more stable Au&#8722;CNHC bonds.







Abstract
A series of [2]catenanes has been prepared from di&#8208;NHC building blocks by utilizing solvophobic effects and/or &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interactions. The dinickel naphthobiscarbene complex syn&#8208;[1] and the kinked biphenyl&#8208;bridged bipyridyl ligand L2 yield the [2]catenane [2&#8208;IL](OTf)4 by self&#8208;assembly. Solvophobic effects are pivotal for the formation of the interlocked species. Substitution of the biphenyl&#8208;linker in L2 for a pyromellitic diimide group gave ligand L3, which yielded in combination with syn&#8208;[1] the [2]catenane [3&#8208;IL](OTf)4. This assembly exhibits enhanced stability in diluted solution, aided by additional &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interactions. The &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking was augmented by the introduction of a pyrene bridge between two NHC donors in ligand L4. Di&#8208;NHC precursor H2&#8208;L4(PF6)2 reacts with Ag2O to give the [Ag2L42]2 [2]catenane [4&#8208;IL](PF6)4, which shows strong &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interactions between the pyrene groups. This assembly was readily converted into the [Au2L42]2 gold species [5&#8208;IL](PF6)4, which exhibits exceptional stability based on the strong &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interactions and the enhanced stability of the Au&#8208;CNHC bonds.

         <title>Solution&#8208;State 2D NMR Spectroscopy of Mixtures HyperpolarizedUsing Optically Polarized Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
HYPNOESYS (Hyperpolarized NOE System) has recently emerged as a promising approach to enhance the sensitivity of NMR spectroscopy in the solution state. We show that 2D NMR spectra can be obtained from HYPNOESYS&#8208;polarized samples, using single&#8208;scan acquisition methods, paving the way to a sensitive, information&#8208;rich and affordable analytical method.







Abstract
The HYPNOESYS method (Hyperpolarized NOE System), which relies on the dissolution of optically polarized crystals, has recently emerged as a promising approach to enhance the sensitivity of NMR spectroscopy in the solution state. However, HYPNOESYS is a single&#8208;shot method that is not generally compatible with multidimensional NMR. Here we show that 2D NMR spectra can be obtained from HYPNOESYS&#8208;polarized samples, using single&#8208;scan acquisition methods. The approach is illustrated with a mixture of terpene molecules and a benchtop NMR spectrometer, paving the way to a sensitive, information&#8208;rich and affordable analytical method.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Lithium Argyrodite Solid Electrolytes Enabling Stable All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>

Configurational entropy (compositional disorder in the anion sublattice) shows a direct correlation with ionic conductivity in lithium argyrodite superionic solid electrolytes.







Abstract
Superionic solid electrolytes (SEs) are essential for bulk&#8208;type solid&#8208;state battery (SSB) applications. Multicomponent SEs are recently attracting attention for their favorable charge&#8208;transport properties, however a thorough understanding of how configurational entropy (&#916;Sconf) affects ionic conductivity is lacking. Here, we successfully synthesized a series of halogen&#8208;rich lithium argyrodites with the general formula Li5.5PS4.5ClxBr1.5&#8208;x (0&#8804;x&#8804;1.5). Using neutron powder diffraction and 31P magic&#8208;angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the S2&#8722;/Cl&#8722;/Br&#8722; occupancy on the anion sublattice was quantitatively analyzed. We show that disorder positively affects Li&#8208;ion dynamics, leading to a room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of 22.7&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 (9.6&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 in cold&#8208;pressed state) for Li5.5PS4.5Cl0.8Br0.7 (&#916;Sconf=1.98R). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence that configurational entropy of the anion sublattice correlates with ion mobility. Our results indicate the possibility of improving ionic conductivity in ceramic ion conductors by tailoring the degree of compositional complexity. Moreover, the Li5.5PS4.5Cl0.8Br0.7 SE allowed for stable cycling of single&#8208;crystal LiNi0.9Co0.06Mn0.04O2 (s&#8208;NCM90) composite cathodes in SSB cells, emphasizing that dual&#8208;substituted lithium argyrodites hold great promise in enabling high&#8208;performance electrochemical energy storage.

         <title>Slowly Removing Surface Ligand by Aging the Sample Enhances the Stability of Pd Nanosheets toward Electron Beam Irradiation and Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface ligands play an important role in shape&#8208;controlled growth and stabilization of colloidal nanocrystals. Their quick removal tends to cause structural deformation and/or aggregation to the nanocrystals. Herein, we demonstrate that the surface ligand based on poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) can be slowly removed from Pd nanosheets (NSs, 0.93 &#177; 0.17 nm in thickness) by simply aging the colloidal suspension. The aged Pd NSs show well&#8208;preserved morphology, together with significantly enhanced stability toward both electron beam (e&#8208;beam) irradiation and electrocatalysis (e.g., for the ethanol oxidation reaction). It is revealed that the slow desorption of PVP during aging forces the re&#8208;exposed Pd atoms to reorganize, facilitating the surface to transform from being nearly perfect to defect&#8208;rich. The resultant Pd NSs with abundant defects no longer rely on surface ligand to stabilize the atomic arrangement and thus show excellent structural and electrochemical stability. This work provides a facile and effective method to maintain the integrity of colloidal nanocrystals by slowly removing the surface ligand.</dc:description>

This was enabled by an enantioselective intramolecular organocatalysed desymmetrising Michael addition of a malonamate ester to a linked dienone substrate that established pivotal stereocentres in excellent enantio&#8208; and complete diastereoselectivity. Furthermore, a key hemiaminal intermediate was accessed by developing an iridium&#8208;catalysed reductive cyclisation, and the scope of this transformation was explored to produce a range of bicyclic hemiaminal motifs. Once installed, the hemiaminal motif was used to initiate a biomimetic cascade to access the natural product directly in a single step.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic Fluoromethylation as Tool for ATP&#8208;independent Ligation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>S&#8208;adenosylmethionine dependent methyltransferases are involved in countless biological processes, including signal transduction, epigenetics, natural product biosynthesis or detoxification. Only a hand full of carboxylate methyltransferases have evolved to participate in amide bond formation. In this report we show that enzyme&#8208;catalyzed F&#8208;methylation of carboxylate substrates produces F&#8208;methyl esters that readily react with N&#8208; or S&#8208;nucleophiles under physiological conditions. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach to the synthesis of small amides, hydroxamates and thioesters, to site&#8208;specific protein modification and native chemical ligation.</dc:description>

         <title>Small Cobalt Nanoparticles Favor Reverse Water&#8208;Gas Shift Reaction Over Methanation Under CO2&#160;Hydrogenation Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cobalt&#8208;based catalysts are well&#8208;known to convert syngas into a variety of Fischer&#8208;Tropsch (FTS) products depending on the various reaction parameters, in particular particle size. In contrast, the reactivity of these particles has been much less investigated in the context of CO2&#160;hydrogenation. In that context, Surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) was employed to synthesize highly dispersed cobalt nanoparticles (Co&#8208;NPs) with particle sizes ranging from 1.6 to 3.0 nm. These SOMC&#8208;derived Co&#8208;NPs display significantly different catalytic performances under CO2 hydrogenation conditions: while the smallest cobalt nanoparticles (1.6 nm) catalyze mainly the reverse water&#8208;gas shift (rWGS) reaction, the larger nanoparticles (2.1&#8208;3.0 nm) favor the expected methanation activity.&#160;Operando&#160;X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy shows that the smaller cobalt particles are fully oxidized under CO2&#160;hydrogenation conditions, while the larger ones remain mostly metallic, paralleling the observed difference of catalytic performances. This fundamental shift of selectivity, away from methanation to reverse water&#8208;gas shift for the smaller nanoparticles is noteworthy and correlates with the formation of CoO under CO2 hydrogenation conditions</dc:description>

         <title>Intergranular Shielding for Ultrafine&#8208;Grained Mo&#8208;Doped Ni&#8208;Rich Li[Ni0.96Co0.04]O2 Cathode for Li&#8208;Ion Batteries with High Energy Density and Long Life</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deploying Ni&#8208;enriched (Ni&#8805;95%) layered cathodes for high energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) requires resolving a series of technical challenges. Among them, the structural weaknesses of the cathode, vigorous reactivity of the labile Ni4+ ion species, gas evolution and associated cell swelling, and thermal instability issues are critical obstacles that must be solved. Herein, we propose an intuitive strategy that can effectively ameliorate the degradation of an extremely high&#8208;Ni&#8208;layered cathode, the construction of ultrafine&#8208;scale microstructure and subsequent intergranular shielding of grains. The formation of ultrafine grains in the Ni&#8208;enriched Li[Ni0.96Co0.04]O2 (NC96) cathode, achieved by impeding particle coarsening during cathode calcination, noticeably improved the mechanical durability and electrochemical performance of the cathode. However, the buildup of the strain&#8208;resistant microstructure in Mo&#8208;doped NC96 concurrently increased the cathode&#8208;electrolyte contact area at the secondary particle surface, which adversely accelerated parasitic reactions with the electrolyte. The intergranular protection of the refined microstructure resolved the remaining chemical instability of the Mo&#8208;doped NC96 cathode by forming an F&#8208;induced coating layer, effectively alleviating structural degradation and gas generation, thereby extending the battery&#8217;s lifespan. The proposed strategies synergistically improved the structural and chemical durability of the NC96 cathode, satisfying the energy density, life cycle performance, and safety requirements for next&#8208;generation LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecularly Produced Light and Its Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecularly generated light, referred to here as &#8220;molecular light&#8221;, mainly includes bioluminescence, chemiluminescence, and Cerenkov luminescence. Molecular light possesses unique dual features of being both a molecule and a source of light. Its molecular nature enables it to be delivered as molecules to regions deep within the body, overcoming the limitations of natural sunlight and physically generated light sources like lasers and LEDs. Simultaneously, its light properties make it valuable for applications such as imaging, photodynamic therapy, photo&#8208;oxidative therapy, and photobiomodulation. In this review article, we provide an updated overview of the diverse applications of molecular light and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of molecular light across various domains. Lastly, we present forward&#8208;looking perspectives on the potential of molecular light in the realms of molecular imaging, photobiological mechanisms, therapeutic applications, and photobiomodulation. While some of these perspectives may be considered bold and contentious, our intent is to inspire further innovations in the field of molecular light applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Sieving of Propyne/Propylene by a Scalable Nanoporous Crystal with Confined Rotational Shutters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Soft porous coordination polymers (PCPs) have the remarkable ability to recognize similar molecules due to their structural dynamics. However, their guest&#8208;induced gate&#8208;opening behaviors often lead to issues with selectivity and separation efficiency, as co&#8208;adsorption is nearly unavoidable. Herein, we report a strategy of a confined&#8208;rotational shutter, in which the rotation of pyridyl rings within the confined nanospace of a halogen&#8208;bonded coordination framework (NTU&#8208;88) creates a maximum aperture of 4.4 &#197;, which is very close to the molecular size of propyne (C3H4: 4.4 &#197;), but smaller than that of propylene (C3H6: 5.4 &#197;). This has been evidenced by crystallographic analyses and modelling calculations. The NTU&#8208;88o (open phase of activated NTU&#8208;88) demonstrates dedicated C3H4 adsorption, and thereby yielding a sieving separation of C3H4/C3H6 at ambient conditions. The integrated nature of high uptake ratio, considerable capacity, scalable synthesis, and good stability make NTU&#8208;88 a promising candidate for feasible C3H4 removal from C3H4/C3H6 mixtures. In principle, this strategy holds high potential for extension to soft families, making it a powerful tool for optimizing materials that can tackle challenging separations with no co&#8208;adsorption, while retaining the crucial aspect of high capacity.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Controlled Gating of Selective Bacterial Membrane Interaction and Enhanced Antibacterial Activity for Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reversible biointerfaces are essential for on&#8208;demand molecular recognition to regulate stimuli responsive bioactivity such as specific interactions with cell membrane. The reversibility on a single platform allows the smart material to kill pathogens or attach/detach cells.&#160;Herein, we introduce a 2D&#8208;MoS2 functionalized with cationic azobenzene&#160;that interacts selectively with either Gram&#8208;positive or Gram&#8208;negative bacteria in a light&#8208;gated fashion. The&#160;trans conformation (trans&#8208;Azo&#8208;MoS2) selectively kills Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, whereas the cis form (cis&#8208;Azo&#8208;MoS2) under UV light, exhibits antibacterial activity against Gram&#8208;positive strain. The mechanistic investigation indicates that the cis&#8208;Azo&#8208;MoS2 selectively binds with bacterial membrane of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria than&#160;trans&#8208;Azo&#8208;MoS2. In case of Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, trans&#8208;Azo&#8208;MoS2 internalizes more efficiently than cis&#8208;Azo&#8208;MoS2 and generate intracellular ROS&#160;to kill the bacteria. While the trans&#8208;Azo&#8208;MoS2exhibits strong electrostatic interactions and internalizes faster into Gram&#8208;negative bacterial cells, cis&#8208;Azo&#8208;MoS2 primarily interacts with Gram&#8208;positive bacteria through hydrophobic and H&#8208;bonding interactions. The difference in molecular mechanism leads to photo&#8208;controlled Gram&#8208;selectivity and enhanced antibacterial activity. We found strain&#8208;specific and high bactericidal activity (minimal bactericidal concentration,&#160;0.65 ug/ml) with low cytotoxicity, which we extended to wound healing applications. This methodology provides a single platform for efficiently switching between conformers to reversibly control the strain selective bactericidal activity regulated by light.</dc:description>

While the trans-Azo-MoS2exhibits strong electrostatic interactions and internalizes faster into Gram-negative bacterial cells, cis-Azo-MoS2 primarily interacts with Gram-positive bacteria through hydrophobic and H-bonding interactions. The difference in molecular mechanism leads to photo-controlled Gram-selectivity and enhanced antibacterial activity. We found strain-specific and high bactericidal activity (minimal bactericidal concentration,&#160;0.65 ug/ml) with low cytotoxicity, which we extended to wound healing applications. This methodology provides a single platform for efficiently switching between conformers to reversibly control the strain selective bactericidal activity regulated by light.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Allylation of Ketones with 2&#8208;Aza&#8208;1,4&#8208;dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic asymmetric allylation of ketones under proton&#8208;transfer conditions is a challenging issue due to the limited pronucleophiles and the electrophilic inertness of ketones. Herein, a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylation of ketones with 2&#8208;aza&#8208;1,4&#8208;dienes (N&#8208;allyl&#8208;1,1&#8208;diphenylmethanimines) is disclosed, which affords a series of functionalized homoallyl tertiary alcohols in high to excellent enantioselectivity. Interestingly, N&#8208;allyl&#8208;1,1&#8208;diphenylmethanimines work as synthetic equivalents of propanals. Upon the acidic workup, a formal asymmetric &#946;&#8208;addition of propanals to ketones is achieved. An investigation on KIE effect indicates that the deprotonation of N&#8208;allyl&#8208;1,1&#8208;diphenylmethanimines is the rate&#8208;determining step, which generates nucleophilic allyl copper(I) species. Finally, the synthetic utility of the present method is demonstrated by the asymmetric syntheses of (R)&#8208;boivinianin A and (R)&#8208;gossonorol.</dc:description>

         <title>Potential Dominates Structural Recombination of Single Atom Mn Sites for Promoting Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single atom sites (SAS) often undergo structural recombination in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), while the effect of valence state and reconstruction on active centers needs to be investigated thoroughly. Herein, the Mn&#8211;SAS catalyst with uniform and precise Mn&#8211;N4 configuration is rationally designed. We utilize operando synchrotron radiation to track the dynamic evolution of active centers during ORR. Under the applied potential, the structural evolution of Mn&#8211;N4 into Mn&#8211;N3C and further into Mn&#8211;N2C2 configurations is clarified. Simultaneously, the valence states of Mn are increased from +3.0 to +3.8 and then decreased to +3.2. When the potential is removed, the catalyst returned to its initial Mn+3.0&#8211;N4 configuration. Such successive evolutions optimize the electronic and geometric structures of active centers as evidenced by theory calculations. The evolved Mn+3.8&#8211;N3C and Mn+3.2&#8211;N2C2 configurations respectively adjust the O2 adsorption and reduce the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step. Thus, it can achieve an onset potential of 0.99 V, superior stability over 10,000 cycles, and a high turnover frequency of 1.59 s&#8211;1 at 0.85 VRHE. Our present work provides new insights into the construction of well&#8208;defined SAS catalysts by regulating the valence states and configurations of active centers.</dc:description>

         <title>Aptamer&#8208;Assisted Blockade of the Immune Suppressor Sialic Acid&#8208;Binding Immunoglobulin&#8208;Like Lectin&#8208;15 for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The percentage of low response and adaptive resistance to current antibody&#8208;based immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy requires the development of novel immunotherapy strategies. Here, we developed an aptamer&#8208;assisted immune checkpoint blockade (Ap&#8208;ICB) against sialic acid&#8208;binding immunoglobulin&#8209;like lectin&#8208;15 (Sigelc&#8208;15), a novel immune suppressor broadly upregulated on cancer cells/tumor infiltrating myeloid cells and mutually exclusive of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1). Using protein aptamer selection, we identified WXY3 aptamer with high affinity against Sigelc&#8208;15 protein/Sigelc&#8208;15 positive cells. We demonstrated that WXY3 aptamer rescued antigen&#8208;specific T cell responses in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, the WXY3 Ap&#8208;ICB against Siglec&#8208;15 amplified anti&#8208;tumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment and inhibited tumor growth/metastasis in syngeneic mouse model, which may result from enhanced macrophage and T cell functionality. In addition, by using aptamer&#8208;based spherical nucleic acids, we developed a synergetic ICB strategy of multivalent binding and steric hindrance, which further improves the in vivo anti&#8208;tumor effect. Taken together, our results support Ap&#8208;ICB targeted Siglec&#8208;15 as a potential strategy for normalization cancer immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing the CO2 Conversion at Electrode/Electrolyte Interfaces in Li&#8211;CO2 Batteries via Nanoscale Visualization Methods</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8211;carbon dioxide (Li&#8211;CO2) battery technology presents a promising opportunity for carbon capture and energy storage. Despite tremendous efforts in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries, the complex electrode/electrolyte/CO2 triple&#8208;phase interfacial processes remain poorly understood, in particular at the nanoscale. Here, using in situ atomic force microscopy and laser confocal microscopy&#8211;differential interference contrast microscopy, we directly observed the CO2 conversion processes in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries, and further revealed a laser&#8208;tuned reaction pathway based on real&#8208;time observations at the nanoscale. A bi&#8208;component composite of Li2CO3/C deposits as micron&#8208;sized clusters during discharge, obeying a 3D progressive growth model, and following a 3D decomposition pathway during the recharge. When the cell operates under laser irradiation, densely packed Li2CO3/C flakes deposit whose nucleation and growth processes deviate from the classical models. They predominantly decompose at the bottom interface, causing irreversible capacity degradation. In situ Raman shows that the laser promotes the formation of poorly soluble intermediates, which in turn affects growth/decomposition pathways of Li2CO3/C and the cell performance. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into interfacial evolution in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries and the laser&#8208;tuned CO2 conversion reactions, which can inspire strategies of monitoring and controlling the multistep and multiphase interfacial reactions in advanced electrochemical devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Charge Transfer Enabled by Noncovalent Interaction through Guest Insertion in Supercapacitors based on Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been proposed for electrochemical energy storage, although the poor conductivity resulted from covalent bonds limits their practical performance. Here, we propose to introduce noncovalent bonds in COFs through a molecular insertion strategy for improving the conductivity of the COFs as supercapacitor. The synthesized COFs (MI&#8208;COFs) establish equilibriums between covalent bonds and noncovalent bonds, which construct a continuous charge transfer channel to enhance the conductivity. The rapid charge transfer rate enables the COFs to activate the redox sites, bringing about excellent electrochemical energy storage behavior. The results show that the MI&#8208;COFs exhibit much better performance in specific capacitance and capacity retention rate than those of most COFs&#8208;based supercapacitors. Moreover, through simply altering inserted guests, the mode and strength of noncovalent bond can be adjusted to obtain different energy storage characteristics. The introduction of noncovalent bonds is an effective and flexible way to enhance and regulate the properties of COFs, providing a valuable direction for the development of novel COFs&#8208;based energy storage materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Spiky Artificial Peroxidases with V&#8211;O&#8211;Fe Pair Sites for Combating Antibiotic&#8208;Resistant Pathogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the sharp rise of antibiotic&#8208;resistant pathogens worldwide, it is of enormous importance to create new strategies for combating pathogenic bacteria . Here, we create an iron oxide&#8208;based spiky artificial peroxidase (POD) with V&#8211;O&#8211;Fe pair sites (V&#8208;Fe2O3) for combating methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The experimental studies and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the V&#8208;Fe2O3 can achieve the localized "capture and killing" bifunction from the spiky  morphology and massive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The V&#8208;Fe2O3 can reach nearly 100% bacterial inhibition over a long period by efficiently oxidizing the lipid membrane. Our wound disinfection results identify that the V&#8208;Fe2O3 can not only efficiently eliminate MRSA and their biofilm but also accelerate wound recovery without causing noticeable inflammation and toxicity. This work offers essential insights into the critical roles of V&#8211;O&#8211;Fe pair sites and localized &#8220;capture and killing&#8221; in biocatalytic disinfection and provides a promising pathway for the de novo design of efficient artificial peroxidases.</dc:description>

This work offers essential insights into the critical roles of V&#8211;O&#8211;Fe pair sites and localized &#8220;capture and killing&#8221; in biocatalytic disinfection and provides a promising pathway for the de novo design of efficient artificial peroxidases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Gram&#8208;level NH3 Electrosynthesis via NOx reduction on Cu Activated Co Electrode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ambient electrochemical ammonia (NH3) synthesis is one promising alternative to the energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8208;Bosch route. However, the industrial requirement for the electrochemical NH3 production with amperes current densities or gram&#8208;level NH3 yield remains a grand challenge. Herein, we report the high&#8208;rate NH3 production via NO3&#8208; and NO2&#8208; reduction using the Cu activated Co electrode in a bipolar membrane (BPM) assemble electrolyser, wherein BPM maintains the ion balance and the liquid level of electrolyte. Benefited from the abundant activated Co sites and optimal structure, the target CuCo electrode delivers a current density of 2.64 A cm&#8208;2 with the Faradaic efficiency of 96.45% and the high NH3 yield rate of 279.44 mg h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 in H&#8208;type cell using alkaline electrolyte. Combined with in&#8208;situ experiments and theoretical calculations, we found that Cu optimizes the adsorption behavior of NO2&#8208; and facilitates the hydrogenation steps on Co sites toward a rapid NO2&#8208; reduction process. Importantly, this activated Co electrode affords a large NH3 production up to 4.11 g h&#8208;1 in a homemade reactor, highlighting its large&#8208;scale practical feasibility.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron Spin&#8208;Dependent Electrocatalysis for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction in a Chiro&#8208;Self&#8208;Assembled Iron Phthalocyanine Device</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity effect (CISS) is a breakthrough phenomenon that has revolutionized the field of electrocatalysis. We report the first study on the electron spin&#8208;dependent electrocatalysis for the oxygen reduction reaction, ORR, using iron phthalocyanine, FePc, a well&#8208;known molecular catalyst for this reaction. The FePc complex belongs to the non&#8208;precious catalysts group, whose active site, FeN4, emulates catalytic centers of biocatalysts such as Cytochrome C. This study presents an experimental platform involving FePc self&#8208;assembled to a gold electrode surface using chiral peptides (L and D enantiomers), i.e., chiro&#8208;self&#8208;assembled FePc systems (CSAFePc). The chiral peptides behave as spin filters axial ligands of the FePc. One of the main findings is that the peptides' handedness and length in CSAFePc can optimize the kinetics and thermodynamic factors governing ORR. Moreover, the D&#8208;enantiomer promotes the highest electrocatalytic activity of FePc for ORR, shifting the onset potential up to 1.01 V vs. RHE in an alkaline medium, a potential close to the reversible potential of the O2/H2O couple. Therefore, this work has exciting implications for developing highly efficient and bioinspired catalysts, considering that, in biological organisms, biocatalysts that promote O2 reduction to water comprise L&#8208;enantiomers.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Basis of the Bivalency of the TRPV1 Agonist DkTx</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bivalency is a prevalent natural mechanism to enhance receptor avidity. Various two&#8208;domain disulfide&#8208;rich peptides exhibiting bivalent action have been identified from animal venoms. A unique characteristic of these peptides is that they induce a pharmacological response different from that provoked by any of the constituent domains. The enhanced potency and avidity of such peptides is therefore a consequence of their domain fusion by a peptide linker. The role of the linker itself, beyond conjugation, remains unclear. Here, we investigate how the linker affects the bivalency of the capsaicin receptor (TRPV1) agonist DkTx. We recombinantly produced isotope labelled DkTx using a protein splicing approach, to solve the high&#8208;resolution solution structure of DkTx, revealing residual linker order stabilised by linker&#8208;domain interactions leading to biased domain orientations. The significance of this was studied using a combination of mutagenesis, spin relaxation studies and electrophysiology measurements. Our results reveal that disrupting the pre&#8208;organisation of the domains of DkTx is accompanied by reductions in potency and onset of avidity. Our findings support a model of pre&#8208;configured two&#8208;domain binding, in favour of the previously suggested sequential binding model. This highlights the significance of ordered elements in linker design and the natural evolution of these in bivalent toxins.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Remote Enantioselective Sulfonylation of Yne&#8208;Allylic Esters with Sodium Sulfinates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric propargylic substitution (APS) reaction has made impressive progress but its use in remote asymmetric yne&#8208;allylic substitution remains a challenging topic. Herein, we report the first remote enantioselective copper&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylation of yne&#8208;allylic esters with sodium sulfinates. The reaction is assumed to occur via a copper&#8208;vinylvinylidene species as the key reactive intermediate. The use of readily available starting materials, mild reaction conditions, excellent regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208; and stereoselectivity, as well as a broad substrate scope (&gt;70 examples) illustrate the practicality and attractiveness of this method.</dc:description>

         <title>AIEgens Cross&#8208;Linked Iron Oxide Nanoparticles Synchronously Amplify Bimodal Imaging Signals in Situ by Tumor Acidity&#8208;Mediated Click Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Activatable dual&#8208;modal molecular imaging probes present a promising tool for the diagnosis of malignant tumors. However, synchronously enhancing dual&#8208;modal imaging signals under a single stimulus is challenging. Herein, we propose an activatable bimodal probe that integrates aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) and iron oxide nanoparticles (IOs) to synergistically enhance near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) intensity and magnetic resonance (MR) contrast through a tumor acidity&#8208;mediated click reaction. Tumor acidity&#8208;responsive IOs containing dibenzocyclooctyne groups (termed cDIOs) and AIEgens containing azide groups (termed AATs) can be covalently cross&#8208;linked in response to tumor acidity, which leads to a simultaneous enhancement in NIRF intensity (~12.4&#8208;fold) and r2 relaxivity (~2.8&#8208;fold). cDIOs and AATs were effective activated in mice orthotropic breast tumor, and the cross&#8208;linking prolonged their retention in tumor, further augmenting the bimodal signals and expanding imaging time frame. This facile strategy leverages the inherent properties of probes themselves and demonstrates promise in future translational studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Preparation of Carbohydrate&#8208;Containing Adjuvants Based on Self&#8208;Assembling Glycopeptide Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbohydrates are intriguing biomolecules possessing diverse biological activities including immune stimulating capability. However, their biomedical applications have been limited by the complex and heterogeneous structures. Here, we have utilized a self&#8208;assembling glycopeptide conjugate (GPC) system to produce uniform nanoribbons appending homogeneous oligosaccharides in multivalency. This system successfully translates the non&#8208;trivial structural differences of oligomannoses into varied binding affinities to C&#8208;type lectin receptors (CLRs). We have shown that GPCs could promote the CLR&#8208;mediated endocytosis of ovalbumin (OVA) antigen, and two mannotriose&#8208;modified peptides F3m2 and F3m5 exhibit potent activity in inducing antigen&#8208;presenting cell maturation, as indicated by increased CD86 and MHCII expression. In vivo studies demonstrate that GPCs, combined with OVA antigen, significantly enhanced OVA&#8208;specific antibody production. Specifically, F3m2 and F3m5 exhibited the highest immunostimulatory effects, eliciting both Th1&#8208; and Th2&#8208;biased immune responses, and promoting differentiation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. These findings highlight the potential of GPCs as vaccine adjuvants, and showcase their versatility in exploiting the biological functions of carbohydrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Disulfide Click Reaction for Stapling of S&#8208;terminal Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A disulfide click strategy was disclosed for stapling to enhance metabolic stability and cellular permeability for therapeutic peptides. A seventeen&#8208;membered library of  stapling reagents with adjustable lengths and angles was established for rapid double/triple click reactions, bridging S&#8208;terminal peptides from 3 to 18 cysteine residues to provide 18&#8208; to 48&#8208;membered macrocyclic peptides under biocompatible conditions. The constrained peptides exhibited enhanced anti&#8211;HCT&#8211;116 activity with locked &#945;&#8208;helical conformation (IC50 = 6.81 &#956;M vs biological incompetence for acyclic linear peptides), which can be unstapled for rehabilitating the native peptides under the assistance of tris(2&#8208;carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP). This protocol assembles linear peptides into cyclic peptides controllably to retain the diverse three&#8208;dimensional conformations, enabling the cellular uptake followed by release of the disulfides for peptide delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Oxygenative Skeletal Rearrangement of Tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines Using H2O and O2 as Oxygen Sources</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report an unprecedented skeletal rearrangement reaction of tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines enabled by copper&#8208;catalyzed single&#8208;electron oxidative oxygenation, in which H2O and O2 act as oxygen sources to generate a unique 2&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;3&#8208;peroxide indoline intermediate. The synthetic reactivity of 2&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;3&#8208;peroxide indoline species was demonstrated by a unique multi&#8208;step bond cleavage and formation cascade. Using a readily available copper catalyst under open&#8208;air conditions, highly important yet synthetically difficult spiro[pyrrolidone&#8208;(3,1&#8208;benzoxazine)] products were obtained in a single operation. The synthetic utility of this methodology is demonstrated by the efficient synthesis of the natural products donaxanine and chimonamidine, as well as the 3&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;pyrroloindoline scaffold, in just one or two steps.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid supramolecular polymers using polyoxometalate (POM) as building block is expected to bring new opportunities to the functionalization of supramolecular polymers and the development of novel POM&#8208;based soft materials. Here, by using the orthogonal self&#8208;assembly based on host&#8208;guest interactions and metal&#8208;ligand interactions, we report the in situ construction of a novel POM&#8208;based hybrid supramolecular polymer (POM&#8208;SP) at the oil&#8208;water interface, while the redox and competitive responsiveness can be triggered independently. Moreover, the binding energy of POM&#8208;SP at the interface is sufficiently strong so that the assembly of POM&#8208;SP jams, allowing the stabilization of liquids in nonequilibrium shapes, offering the possibility of fabricating all&#8208;liquid constructs with reconfigurability.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct quantification of nanoplastics neurotoxicity by single&#8208;vesicle electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoplastics are recently recognized as neurotoxic factors for the nervous systems. However, whether and how they affect vesicle chemistry (i.e., vesicular catecholamine content and exocytosis) remains unclear. This study offers a first direct evidence on the nanoplastics&#8208;induced neurotoxicity at a single&#8208;cell level by single&#8208;vesicle electrochemistry. We observe the cellular uptake secretion of polystyrene (PS) nanoplastics into model neuronal cells and mouse primary neurons, leading to cell viability loss depending on nanoplastics exposure time and concentration. By using single&#8208;vesicle electrochemistry, we find the reductions in the&#160;vesicular catecholamine content, the frequency of stimulated exocytotic spikes, the neurotransmitter release amount of single exocytotic event, and the membrane&#8208;vesicle fusion pore opening&#8208;closing speed. Mechanistic investigations suggest that PS nanoplastics can cause disruption of filamentous actin (F&#8208;actin) assemblies at cytomembrane zones and change the kinetic patterns of vesicle exocytosis. Our finding shapes the first quantitative, multi&#8208;spatiotemporal picture of high concentration of nanoplastics&#8208;induced neurotoxicity at a single&#8208;cell level.</dc:description>

         <title>Effective Inhibition of TDP&#8208;43 Aggregation by Native State Stabilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Preventing the misfolding or aggregation of transactive response DNA binding protein with 43 kDa (TDP&#8208;43) is the most actively pursued disease&#8208;modifying strategy to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases. In this work, we provide proof of concept that native state stabilization of TDP&#8208;43 is a viable and effective strategy for treating TDP&#8208;43 proteinopathies. Firstly, we leveraged the Cryo&#8208;EM structures of TDP&#8208;43 fibrils to design C&#8208;terminal substitutions that disrupt TDP&#8208;43 aggregation. Secondly, we showed that these substitutions (S333D/S342D) stabilize monomeric TDP&#8208;43 without altering its physiological properties. Thirdly, we demonstrated that binding native oligonucleotide ligands stabilized monomeric TDP&#8208;43 and prevented its fibrillization and phase separation in the absence of direct binding to the aggregation&#8208;prone C&#8208;terminal domain. Fourthly, we showed that the monomeric TDP&#8208;43 variant could be induced to aggregate in a controlled manner, which enabled the design and implementation of a high&#8208;throughput screening assay to identify native state stabilizers of TDP&#8208;43. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that different structural domains in TDP&#8208;43 could be exploited and targeted to develop drugs that stabilize the native state of TDP&#8208;43 and provide a platform to discover novel drugs to treat TDP&#8208;43 proteinopathies.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailored Zwitterionic Hemicyanine Reporters for Early Diagnosis and Prognostic Assessment of Acute Renal Failure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Drug&#8208;induced renal failure (DIRF) poses a serious medical complication with high mortality risk. However, early diagnosis or prognosis of DIRF remain challenging, as current methods rely on detecting late&#8208;stage biomarkers. Herein we present a library of zwitterionic unimolecular hemicyanines (ZCs) available for constructing activatable reporters to detect DIRF since its initial stage. Zwitterionic properties of these probes are achieved through interspersedly integrating alkyl sulfonates and quaternary ammo&#8208;nium cations onto hemicyanine skeleton, which result in record low plasma protein binding (&lt;5%) and remarkable renal clearance efficiencies (~96%). An activatable reporter ZCRR is further developed by masking the optimal candidate ZC6 with a tetrapeptide specifically cleavable by caspase&#8208;8, an initiating indicator of apoptosis. In living mice with cisplatin&#8208;induced DIRF, systematically administered ZCRR efficiently accumulates in kidneys and responds to elevated caspase&#8208;8 for near&#8208;infrared fluorescence signals &#8216;turn&#8208;on&#8217;, enabling sensitive detection of intrarenal apoptosis 60 h earlier than clinical methods, and precise evaluation of apoptosis remediation effects by different medications on DIRF mice. As it&#8217;s urinary excretable, ZCRR also allows for remote detection of DIRF and predicting renoprotective efficacy through in vitro optical urinalysis. This study thus presents unimolecular renal clearable scaffolds that are applicable to developing versatile activatable reporters for renal diseases management.</dc:description>

         <title>Breaking Mass Transport Limitations by Iodized Polyacrylonitrile Anodes for Extremely Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fast&#8208;charging capability of rechargeable batteries is greatly limited by the sluggish ion transport kinetics in anode materials. Here we develop an iodized polyacrylonitrile (I&#8208;PAN) anode that can boost the bulk/interphase lithium (Li)&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics and accelerate Li&#8208;ion desolvation process to realize high&#8208;performance fast&#8208;charging Li&#8208;ion batteries. The iodine immobilized in I&#8208;PAN framework expands ion transport channels, compresses the electric double layer, and changes the inner Helmholtz plane to form LiF/LiI&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase layer. The dissolved iodine ions in the electrolyte self&#8208;induced by the interfacial nucleophilic substitution of PF6&#8208; not only promote the Li&#8208;ion desolvation process, but also reuse the plated/dead Li formed on the anode under fast&#8208;charging conditions. Consequently, the I&#8208;PAN anode exhibits a high capacity of 228.5 mA h g&#8208;1 (39% of capacity at 0.5 A g&#8208;1 delivered in 18 seconds) and negligible capacity decay for 10000 cycles at 20 A g&#8208;1. The I&#8208;PAN||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 full cell shows excellent fast&#8208;charging performance with attractive capacities and negligible capacity decay for 1000 cycles at extremely high rates of 5 C and 10 C (1 C = 180 mA g&#8208;1). We also demonstrate high&#8208;performance fast&#8208;charging sodium&#8208;ion batteries using I&#8208;PAN anodes.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The fast-charging capability of rechargeable batteries is greatly limited by the sluggish ion transport kinetics in anode materials. Here we develop an iodized polyacrylonitrile (I-PAN) anode that can boost the bulk/interphase lithium (Li)-ion diffusion kinetics and accelerate Li-ion desolvation process to realize high-performance fast-charging Li-ion batteries. The iodine immobilized in I-PAN framework expands ion transport channels, compresses the electric double layer, and changes the inner Helmholtz plane to form LiF/LiI-rich solid electrolyte interphase layer. The dissolved iodine ions in the electrolyte self-induced by the interfacial nucleophilic substitution of PF6- not only promote the Li-ion desolvation process, but also reuse the plated/dead Li formed on the anode under fast-charging conditions. Consequently, the I-PAN anode exhibits a high capacity of 228.5 mA h g-1 (39% of capacity at 0.5 A g-1 delivered in 18 seconds) and negligible capacity decay for 10000 cycles at 20 A g-1. The I-PAN||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 full cell shows excellent fast-charging performance with attractive capacities and negligible capacity decay for 1000 cycles at extremely high rates of 5 C and 10 C (1 C = 180 mA g-1).

         <title>Experimental and Computational Studies on Uranium Diazomethanediide Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this contribution, the synthesis, structure, and reactivity of metal (uranium) diazomethanediide complexes containing bridging and/or terminal isocyanoimido groups (U=NNC) are presented. By a combined experimental and computational study, unique reactivity patterns were identified and this gained knowledge provides the first insights into the reactivity of complexes containing a metal isocyanoimido (M=NNC) fragment.







Abstract
Uranium diazomethanediide complexes can be prepared and their synthesis, structure and reactivity were explored. Reaction of the uranium imido compound [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3Si)3C5H2]2U=N(p&#8208;tolyl)(dmap) (1) or [&#951;5&#8208;1,3&#8208;(Me3C)2C5H3]2U=N(p&#8208;tolyl)(dmap) (4) with Me3SiCHN2 cleanly yields the first isocyanoimido metal complexes [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3Si)3C5H2]2U(=NNC)(&#956;&#8208;CNN=)U(dmap)[&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3Si)3C5H2]2 (2) and {[&#951;5&#8208;1,3&#8208;(Me3C)2C5H3]2U[&#956;&#8208;(=NNC)]}6 (5), respectively. Both compounds exhibit remarkable thermal stability and were fully characterized. According to density functional theory (DFT) studies the bonding between the Cp2U2+ and [NNC]2&#8722; moieties is strongly polarized with a significant 5&#8201;f orbital contribution, which is also reflected in the reactivity of these complexes. For example, complex 5 acts as a nucleophile toward alkylsilyl halides and engages in a [2+2] cycloaddition with CS2, but no reaction occurs in the presence of internal alkynes.

         <title>Metal&#8208;DNA Nanocomplexes Enhance Chemo&#8208;dynamic Therapy by Inhibiting Autophagy&#8208;Mediated Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating multivalent nucleic acid aptamers and DNAzyme sequences into long single&#8208;stranded DNA and further forming metal&#8208;DNA nanocomplexes using rolling circle amplification (RCA) technology, researchers have successfully established a DNA drug delivery platform that combined chemo&#8208;dynamic therapy (CDT) and autophagy inhibition therapies. The platform overcame the shortcomings of short&#8208;stranded DNA, such as poor stability under physiological conditions, short blood circulation time, and easy clearance by the organism. The novel integration of aptamer and DNAzyme sequence achieved specific blockage of autophagy in tumor cells, weakened the resistance of cancer cells to CDT and successfully induced apoptosis in tumor cells.







Abstract
Chemo&#8208;dynamic therapy (CDT) based on the Fenton or Fenton&#8208;like reaction has emerged as a promising approach for cancer treatment. However, autophagy&#8208;mediated self&#8208;protection mechanisms of cancer cells pose a significant challenge to the efficacy of CDT. Herein, we developed metal&#8208;DNA nanocomplexes (DACs&#8208;Mn) to enhance CDT via DNAzyme inhibition of autophagy. Specifically, Mn&#8208;based catalyst in DACs&#8208;Mn was used to generate highly hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) that kill cancer cells, while the ATG5 DNAzyme incorporated into DACs&#8208;Mn inhibited the expression of autophagy&#8208;associated proteins, thereby improving the efficacy of CDT. By disrupting the self&#8208;protective pathway of cells under severe oxidative stress, this novel approach of DACs&#8208;Mn was found to synergistically enhance CDT in both in vitro and in vivo models, effectively amplifying tumor&#8208;specific oxidative damage. Notably, the Metal&#8208;DNA nanocomplexes can also induce immunogenic cell death (ICD), thereby inhibiting tumor metastasis. Specifically, in a bilateral tumor model in mice, the combined approach of CDT and autophagy inhibition followed by immune checkpoint blockade therapy shown significant potential as a novel and effective treatment modality for primary and metastatic tumors.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Multiblock 1D Supramolecular Copolymers of Ir(III) Complexes with Controllable Sequences</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;component multiblock 1D supramolecular copolymers with up to 9 blocks have been successfully synthesized by precise control of the pathway complexity of Ir(III) complexes. The segmented structures of the multiblock copolymers could be characterized by both TEM and SEM. These three&#8208;component block copolymers with tunable block sequences will advance the development of functional block copolymers.







Abstract
Multicomponent supramolecular block copolymers (BCPs) have attracted much attention due to their potential functionalities, but examples of three&#8208;component supramolecular BCPs are rare. Herein, we report the synthesis of three&#8208;component multiblock 1D supramolecular copolymers of Ir(III) complexes 1&#8211;3 by a sequential seeded supramolecular polymerization approach. Precise control over the kinetically trapped species via the pathway complexity of the monomers is the key to the successful synthesis of BCPs with up to 9 blocks. Furthermore, 5&#8208;block BCPs with different sequences could be synthesized by changing the addition order of the kinetic species during a sequentially seeded process. The corresponding heterogeneous nucleation&#8208;elongation process has been confirmed by the UV/Vis absorption spectra, and each segment of the multiblock copolymers could be characterized by both TEM and SEM. Interestingly, the energy transfer leads to weakened emission of 1&#8208;terminated and enhanced emission of 3&#8208;terminated BCPs. This study will be an important step in advancing the synthesis and properties of three&#8208;component BCPs.

         <title>CycloSiFA: The Next Generation of Silicon&#8208;Based Fluoride Acceptors for Positron Emission Tomography (PET)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic azasilole derivatives undergo ring&#8208;opening with 18F&#8211; anions under mild conditions and with high radiochemical yield. They represent a novel class of Silicon Fluoride Acceptor systems (CycloSiFA) and hold great potential for convenient kit&#8208;like labelling procedures in different medicinal applications.







Abstract
The ring&#8208;opening Si&#8208;fluorination of a variety of azasilole derivatives cyclo&#8208;1&#8208;(iPr2Si)&#8722;4&#8208;X&#8722;C6H3&#8722;2&#8208;CH2NR (4: R=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3, X=H; 4&#8201;a: R=2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2, X=H; 9: R=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3, X=tBuMe2SiO; 10: R=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3, X=OH; 13: R=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3, X=HCCCH2O; 22: R=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3, X=tBuMe2SiCH2O) with different 19F&#8208;fluoride sources was studied, optimized and the experience gained was used in a translational approach to create a straightforward 18F&#8208;labelling protocol for the azasilole derivatives [18F]6 and [18F]14. The latter constitutes a potential clickable CycloSiFA prosthetic group which might be used in PET tracer development using Cu&#8208;catalysed triazole formation. Based on our findings, CycloSiFA has the potential to become a new entry into non&#8208;canonical labelling methodologies for radioactive PET tracer development.

&lt;p&gt;The ring-opening Si-fluorination of a variety of azasilole derivatives &lt;i&gt;cyclo&lt;/i&gt;-1-(&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si)&#8722;4-X&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;2-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NR (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;: R=2,6-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, X=H; &lt;b&gt;4&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;: R=2,4,6-Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, X=H; &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;: R=2,6-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, X=&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;BuMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO; &lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt;: R=2,6-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, X=OH; &lt;b&gt;13&lt;/b&gt;: R=2,6-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, X=HCCCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O; &lt;b&gt;22&lt;/b&gt;: R=2,6-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, X=&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;BuMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) with different &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F-fluoride sources was studied, optimized and the experience gained was used in a translational approach to create a straightforward &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-labelling protocol for the azasilole derivatives [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt; and [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]&lt;b&gt;14&lt;/b&gt;. The latter constitutes a potential clickable &lt;i&gt;Cyclo&lt;/i&gt;SiFA prosthetic group which might be used in PET tracer development using Cu-catalysed triazole formation. Based on our findings, &lt;i&gt;Cyclo&lt;/i&gt;SiFA has the potential to become a new entry into non-canonical labelling methodologies for radioactive PET tracer development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosting H+ Storage in Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries via Integrating Redox&#8208;Active Sites into Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks with Strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; Stacking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate the first case of applying redox&#8208;active hydrogen bonding organic framework with strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; interacting assembled from diaminotriazine moiety decorated hexaazatrinnphthalene as the cathode material for boosting H+ storage in aqueous zinc ion batteries. The unique integration of hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks and strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking endow it rapid Grotthuss proton conduction, stable supramolecular structure and inclined H+ storage.







Abstract
In the emerging aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs), proton (H+) with the smallest molar mass and fast (de)coordination kinetics is considered as the most ideal charge carrier compared with Zn2+ counterpart, however, searching for new hosting materials for H+ storage is still at its infancy. Herein, redox&#8208;active hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) assembled from diaminotriazine moiety decorated hexaazatrinnphthalene (HOF&#8208;HATN) are for the first time developed as the stable cathode hosting material for boosting H+ storage in AZIBs. The unique integration of hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks and strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking endow it rapid Grotthuss proton conduction, stable supramolecular structure and inclined H+ storage. As a consequence, HOF&#8208;HATN displays a high capacity (320&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and robust cyclability of (&gt;10000 cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) based on three&#8208;step cation coordination storage. These findings get insight into the proton transport and storage behavior in HOFs and provide the molecular engineering strategy for constructing well&#8208;defined cathode hosting materials for rechargeable aqueous batteries.

         <title>A reversible water&#8208;based electrostatic adhesive</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversible water&#8208;based electrostatic adhesive has been developed through conventional emulsion polymerization using commodity materials. It is made of two formulations, one containing a polycation, and other a polyanion. Detachment is only promoted in highly acidic or alkaline solutions as polyelectrolytes show distinctive charged states. This kind of adhesive would be useful for the recycling and dismantling of products.







Abstract
Commercial adhesives typically fall into two categories: structural or pressure sensitive. Structural glues rely on covalent bonds formed during curing and provide high tensile strength whilst pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives use physical bonding to provide weaker adhesion, but with considerable convenience for the user. Here, a new class of adhesive is presented that is also reversible, with a bond strength intermediate between those of pressure&#8208;sensitive and structural adhesives. Complementary water&#8208;based formulations incorporating oppositely charged polyelectrolytes form electrostatic bonds that may be reversed through immersion in a low or high pH aqueous environment. This electrostatic adhesive has the advantageous property that it exhibits good adhesion to low&#8208;energy surfaces such as polypropylene. Furthermore, it is produced by the emulsion copolymerization of commodity materials, styrene and butyl acrylate, which makes it inexpensive and opens the possibility of industrial production. Bio&#8208;based materials have been also integrated into the formulations to further increase sustainability. Moreover, unlike other water&#8208;based glues, adhesion does not significantly degrade in humid environments. Because such electrostatic adhesives do not require mechanical detachment, they are appropriate for the large&#8208;scale recycling of, e.g., bottle labels or food packaging. The adhesive is also suitable for dismantling components in areas as varied as automotive parts and electronics.

         <title>A NIR Programmable In Vivo miRNA Magnifier for NIR&#8208;II Imaging of Early Stage Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 980/808&#8197;nm NIR programmed in vivo miRNA magnifier is developed by conjugating an activatable DNAzyme walker set to rare&#8208;earth nanoparticles, which detects tumors earlier than size&#8208;monitoring techniques. The 980&#8208;nm excitation&#8208;activated DNA nanomachine for miRNA&#8208;21 recognition and signal amplification to suppress &#8220;false positive&#8221; signals, and imaging in the NIR&#8208;II region under 808&#8197;nm excitation provided deeper penetration and lower background.







Abstract
Aberrant expressions of biomolecules occur much earlier than tumor visualized size and morphology change, but their common measurement strategies such as biopsy suffer from invasive sampling process. In vivo imaging of slight biomolecule expression difference is urgently needed for early cancer detection. Fluorescence of rare earth nanoparticles (RENPs) in second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) region makes them appropriate tool for in vivo imaging. However, the incapacity to couple with signal amplification strategies, especially programmable signal amplification strategies, limited their application in lowly expressed biomarkers imaging. Here we develop a 980/808&#8197;nm NIR programmed in vivo microRNAs (miRNAs) magnifier by conjugating activatable DNAzyme walker set to RENPs, which achieves more effective NIR&#8208;II imaging of early stage tumor than size monitoring imaging technique. Dye FD1080 (FD1080) modified substrate DNA quenches NIR&#8208;II downconversion emission of RENPs under 808&#8197;nm excitation. The miRNA recognition region in DNAzyme walker is sealed by a photo&#8208;cleavable strand to avoid &#8220;false positive&#8221; signal in systemic circulation. Upconversion emission of RENPs under 980&#8197;nm irradiation activates DNAzyme walker for miRNA recognition and amplifies NIR&#8208;II fluorescence recovery of RENPs via DNAzyme catalytic reaction to achieve in vivo miRNA imaging. This strategy demonstrates good application potential in the field of early cancer detection.

         <title>Biodegradable Dual&#8208;Network Cellulosic Composite Bioplastic Metafilm for Plastic Substitute</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel dual&#8208;network design strategy is proposed to prepare a high&#8208;performance cellulosic composite bioplastic metafilm with exceptional mechanical toughness (23.5&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3), flame retardance, and solvent resistance. Moreover, it has a high maximum usage temperature (245&#8201;&#176;C), lower thermal expansion coefficient (15.19&#8197;ppm&#8201;&#176;C&#8722;1), good biocompatibility, and natural biodegradation, which is competitive for plastic substitute.







Abstract
With the escalating environmental and health concerns over petroleum&#8208;based plastics, sustainable and biodegradable cellulosic materials are a promising alternative to plastics, yet remain unsatisfied properties such as fragility, inflammability and water sensitivity for practical usage. Herein, we present a novel dual&#8208;network design strategy to address these limitations and fabricate a high&#8208;performance cellulosic composite bioplastic metafilm with the exceptional mechanical toughness (23.5&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3), flame retardance, and solvent resistance by in situ growth of cyclotriphosphazene&#8208;bridged organosilica network within bacterial cellulose matrix. The phosphorus, nitrogen&#8208;containing organosilica network, verified by the experimental and theoretical results, plays a triple action on significantly enhancing tensile strength, toughness, flame retardance and water resistance of composite bioplastic metafilm. Furthermore, cellulosic bioplastic composite metafilm demonstrates a higher maximum usage temperature (245&#8201;&#176;C), lower thermal expansion coefficient (15.19&#8197;ppm&#8201;&#176;C&#8722;1), and better solvent resistance than traditional plastics, good biocompatibility and natural biodegradation. Moreover, the composite bioplastic metafilm have a good transparency of average 74&#8201;% and a high haze over 80&#8201;%, which can serve as an outstanding substrate substitute for commercial polyethylene terephthalate film to address the demand of flexible ITO films. This work paves a creative way to design and manufacture the competitive bioplastic composite to replace daily&#8208;used plastics.

Furthermore, cellulosic bioplastic composite metafilm demonstrates a higher maximum usage temperature (245&#8201;&#176;C), lower thermal expansion coefficient (15.19&#8197;ppm&#8201;&#176;C&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and better solvent resistance than traditional plastics, good biocompatibility and natural biodegradation. Moreover, the composite bioplastic metafilm have a good transparency of average 74&#8201;% and a high haze over 80&#8201;%, which can serve as an outstanding substrate substitute for commercial polyethylene terephthalate film to address the demand of flexible ITO films. This work paves a creative way to design and manufacture the competitive bioplastic composite to replace daily-used plastics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Heterogeneous Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling for Sustainable Synthesis of Chiral Allenes: Application to the Synthesis of Allenic Natural Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient and stereospecific cross&#8208;coupling of propargylic mesylates and Grignard reagents for the synthesis of diverse chiral allenes catalyzed by a recyclable heterogeneous nanocopper catalyst is reported. The synthetic utility of this sustainable methodology was further demonstrated by its application to the asymmetric total synthesis of 5 valuable allenic natural products.







Abstract
Classical Crabb&#233; type SN2' substitutions of propargylic substrates has served as one of the standard methods for the synthesis of allenes. However, the stereospecific version of this transformation often requires either stoichiometric amounts of organocopper reagents or special functional groups on the substrates, and the chirality transfer efficiency is also capricious. Herein, we report a sustainable methodology for the synthesis of diverse 1,3&#8208;di and tri&#8208;substituted allenes by using a simple and cheap cellulose supported heterogeneous nanocopper catalyst (MCC&#8208;Amp&#8208;Cu(I/II)). This approach represents the first example of heterogeneous catalysis for the synthesis of chiral allenes. High yields and excellent enantiospecificity (up to 97&#8201;% yield, 99&#8201;% ee) were achieved for a wide range of di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted allenes bearing various functional groups. It is worth noting that the applied heterogeneous catalyst could be recycled at least 5&#8197;times without any reduced reactivity. To demonstrate the synthetic utility of the developed protocol, we have applied it to the total synthesis of several chiral allenic natural products.

         <title>Glycan Metabolic Fluorine Labeling for In Vivo Visualization of Tumor Cells and In Situ Assessment of Glycosylation Variations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a strategy called glycan MEtabolic Fluorine LAbeling (glycan MEFLA) for selectively tagging glycans of tumor cells. It allows for efficient and selective labeling of tumor cells by fluorinated monosaccharide&#8208;based probes (Ac4ManNTfe and Ac4GalNTfa), enabling in vivo visualization of tumor cells and in situ assessment of glycosylation changes via 19F MRI with high sensitivity and deep penetration.







Abstract
The abnormality in the glycosylation of surface proteins is critical for the growth and metastasis of tumors and their capacity for immunosuppression and drug resistance. This anomaly offers an entry point for real&#8208;time analysis on glycosylation fluctuations. In this study, we report a strategy, glycan metabolic fluorine labeling (MEFLA), for selectively tagging glycans of tumor cells. As a proof of concept, we synthesized two fluorinated unnatural monosaccharides with distinctive 19F chemical shifts (Ac4ManNTfe and Ac4GalNTfa). These two probes could undergo selective uptake by tumor cells and subsequent incorporation into surface glycans. This approach enables efficient and specific 19F labeling of tumor cells, which permits in vivo tracking of tumor cells and in situ assessment of glycosylation changes by 19F MRI. The efficiency and specificity of our probes for labeling tumor cells were verified in vitro with A549 cells. The feasibility of our method was further validated with in vivo experiments on A549 tumor&#8208;bearing mice. Moreover, the capacity of our approach for assessing glycosylation changes of tumor cells was illustrated both in vitro and in vivo. Our studies provide a promising means for visualizing tumor cells in vivo and assessing their glycosylation variations in situ through targeted multiplexed 19F MRI.

         <title>Rapid Charge Transfer Endowed by Interfacial Ni&#8208;O Bonding in S&#8208;scheme Heterojunction for Efficient Photocatalytic H2 and Imine Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel doping introduces spin&#8208;polarized electrons and weakens H&#8722;S bonds, resulting in enhanced H2 production. Moreover, the interfacial Ni&#8722;O bond significantly strengthens the built&#8208;in electric field (E) and reduces the energy barrier. Benefiting from doping and S&#8208;scheme heterojunction engineering, TiO2/Ni0.08&#8208;Zn0.2Cd0.8S quantum dots (QDs) show good charge transfer and separation, leading to improved H2 production and benzylamine oxidation.







Abstract
Cooperative coupling of H2 evolution with oxidative organic synthesis is promising in avoiding the use of sacrificial agents and producing hydrogen energy with value&#8208;added chemicals simultaneously. Nonetheless, the photocatalytic activity is obstructed by sluggish electron&#8208;hole separation and limited redox potentials. Herein, Ni&#8208;doped Zn0.2Cd0.8S quantum dots are chosen after screening by DFT simulation to couple with TiO2 microspheres, forming a step&#8208;scheme heterojunction. The Ni&#8208;doped configuration tunes the highly active S site for augmented H2 evolution, and the interfacial Ni&#8722;O bonds provide fast channels at the atomic level to lower the energy barrier for charge transfer. Also, DFT calculations reveal an enhanced built&#8208;in electric field in the heterojunction for superior charge migration and separation. Kinetic analysis by femtosecond transient absorption spectra demonstrates that expedited charge migration with electrons first transfer to Ni2+ and then to S sites. Therefore, the designed catalyst delivers drastically elevated H2 yield (4.55&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and N&#8208;benzylidenebenzylamine production rate (3.35&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). This work provides atomic&#8208;scale insights into the coordinated modulation of active sites and built&#8208;in electric fields in step&#8208;scheme heterojunction for ameliorative photocatalytic performance.

         <title>A Gene&#8208;Editable Palladium&#8208;Based Bioorthogonal Nanoplatform Facilitates Macrophage Phagocytosis for Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gene&#8208;editable palladium&#8208;based bioorthogonal nanoplatform was developed to improve tumor management, which can polarize macrophages to the anti&#8208;tumoral M1 phenotype, reprogram tumor cells to suppress anti&#8208;phagocytic signals, and induce the activation of sequestered prodrugs through bioorthogonal catalysis, thereby facilitating macrophage phagocytosis and allowing for more effective tumor treatment.







Abstract
Macrophage phagocytosis of tumor cells has emerged as an attractive strategy for tumor therapy. Nevertheless, immunosuppressive M2 macrophages in the tumor microenvironment and the high expression of anti&#8208;phagocytic signals from tumor cells impede therapeutic efficacy. To address these issues and improve the management of malignant tumors, in this study we developed a gene&#8208;editable palladium&#8208;based bioorthogonal nanoplatform, consisting of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system&#8208;linked Pd nanoclusters, and a hyaluronic acid surface layer (HBPdC). This HBPdC nanoplatform exhibited satisfactory tumor&#8208;targeting efficiency and triggered Fenton&#8208;like reactions in the tumor microenvironment to generate reactive oxygen species for chemodynamic therapy and macrophage M1 polarization, which directly eliminated tumor cells, and stimulated the antitumor response of macrophages. HBPdC could reprogram tumor cells through gene editing to reduce the expression of CD47 and adipocyte plasma membrane&#8208;associated protein, thereby promoting their recognition and phagocytosis by macrophages. Moreover, HBPdC induced the activation of sequestered prodrugs via bioorthogonal catalysis, enabling chemotherapy and thereby enhancing tumor cell death. Importantly, the Pd nanoclusters of HBPdC were sufficiently cleared through basic metabolic pathways, confirming their biocompatibility and biosafety. Therefore, by promoting macrophage phagocytosis, the HBPdC system developed herein represents a highly promising antitumor toolset for cancer therapy applications.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The E3 ligase CHIP promotes ubiquitination of preformed Tau filaments in vitro and in living cellular models. The structural conformations of the fibrils restrict ubiquitination to specific regions of Tau. Tau seeding activity is not impaired by ubiquitination.







Abstract
Post&#8208;translational modifications of Tau are emerging as key players in determining the onset and progression of different tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease, and are recognized to mediate the structural diversity of the disease&#8208;specific Tau amyloids. Here we show that the E3 ligase CHIP catalyzes the site&#8208;specific ubiquitination of Tau filaments both in vitro and in cellular models, proving that also Tau amyloid aggregates are direct substrate of PTMs. Transmission electron microscopy and mass spectrometry analysis on ubiquitin&#8208;modified Tau amyloids revealed that the conformation of the filaments restricts CHIP&#8208;mediated ubiquitination to specific positions of the repeat domain, while only minor alterations in the structure of the fibril core were inferred using seeding experiments in vitro and in a cell&#8208;based tauopathy model. Overexpression of CHIP significantly increased the ubiquitination of exogenous PHF, proving that the ligase can interact and modify Tau aggregates also in a complex cellular environment.

         <title>Ligand Engineering Enables Efficient Pure Red Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The performance of eco&#8208;friendly PEA2SnI4 perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) lags far behind that of lead&#8208;based PeLEDs. We demonstrated a ligand engineering strategy that uses GSH as a surface ligand to strongly interact with I&#8722; and Sn2+ in perovskites, which thus reduces the film crystallization rate and suppresses the oxidation of Sn2+ ions. Pure red PeLEDs based on the modified PEA2SnI4 achieve a record EQEmax of 9.32&#8201;%.







Abstract
With increasing ecological and environmental concerns, tin (Sn)&#8208;based perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are competitive candidates for future displays because of their environmental friendliness, excellent photoelectric properties, and low&#8208;cost solution&#8208;processed fabrication. Nonetheless, their electroluminescence (EL) performance still lags behind that of lead (Pb)&#8208;based PeLEDs due to the fast crystallization rate of Sn&#8208;based perovskite films and undesired oxidation from Sn2+ to Sn4+, leading to poor film morphology and coverage, as well as high density defects. Here, we propose a ligand engineering strategy to construct high&#8208;quality phenethylammonium tin iodide (PEA2SnI4) perovskite films by using L&#8208;glutathione reduced (GSH) as surface ligands toward efficient pure red PEA2SnI4&#8208;based PeLEDs. We show that the hydrogen&#8208;bond and coordinate interactions between GSH and PEA2SnI4 effectively reduce the crystallization rate of the perovskites and suppress the oxidation of Sn2+ and formation of defects. The improved pure red perovskite films not only show excellent uniformity, density, and coverage but also exhibit enhanced optical properties and stability. Finally, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art pure red PeLEDs achieve a record external quantum efficiency of 9.32&#8201;% in the field of PEA2SnI4&#8208;based devices. This work demonstrates that ligand engineering represents a feasible route to enhance the EL performance of Sn&#8208;based PeLEDs.

         <title>Exploration of Chemical Diversity in Intercellular Quorum Sensing Signalling Systems in Prokaryotes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this manuscript, we investigate sets of both closely related and widely diverging quorum sensing (QS) ligand structures to identify orthogonal signalling systems. Our results suggest that structural diversity in QS ligands can be used as a starting point to predict non&#8208;cognate receptor&#8208;ligand binding in intercellular signalling systems.







Abstract
Quorum sensing (QS) serves as a vital means of intercellular signalling in a variety of prokaryotes, which enables single cells to act in multicellular configurations. The potential to control community&#8208;wide responses has also sparked numerous recent biotechnological innovations. However, our capacity to utilize intercellular communication is hindered due to a scarcity of complementary signalling systems and a restricted comprehension of interconnections between these systems caused by variations in their dynamic range. In this study, we utilize uniform manifold approximation and projection and extended&#8208;connectivity fingerprints to explore the available chemical space of QS signalling molecules. We investigate and experimentally characterize a set of closely related QS signalling ligands, consisting of N&#8208;acyl homoserine lactones and the aryl homoserine lactone p&#8208;coumaroyl, as well as a set of more widely diverging QS ligands, consisting of photopyrones, dialkylresorcinols, 3,5&#8208;dimethylpyrazin&#8208;2&#8208;ol and autoinducer&#8208;2, and define their performance. We report on a set of six signal&#8208; and promoter&#8208;orthogonal intercellular QS signalling systems, significantly expanding the toolkit for engineering community&#8208;wide behaviour. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ligand diversity can serve as a statistically significant tool to predict much more complicated ligand&#8208;receptor interactions. This approach highlights the potential of dimensionality reduction to explore chemical diversity in microbial dynamics.

Calculating temperature&#8208;dependent emission lifetimes is like a scavenger hunt. In their Research Article (e202308803), Leticia Gonz&#225;lez et&#8197;al. show that in [Ru(bpy)3]2+, the pathway governed by the lowest&#160;3MC&#8208;trans excited state triplet minimum leads astray. Instead, through the concept of rate&#8208;determining states and an extended kinetic model that takes all the different Jahn&#8211;Teller isomers into account, excellent agreement with the experiment is attained.

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure Fabrication of Binary Organic Solar Cells with High Molecular Weight D18 Yields Record 19.65&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by pressure cooker principles, we employ high&#8208;pressure methods to address challenges in processing high molecular weight polymers. Successfully dissolving HW&#8208;D18 in chloroform at 100&#8201;&#176;C within pressure vials, heightened vapor pressure elevates boiling point and solubility of chloroform. This enables the creation of blend films with superior properties, ultimately achieving an excellent PCE of 19.65&#8201;%, setting a new record for binary OSCs.







Abstract
In this work, inspired by the principles of a pressure cooker, we utilized a high&#8208;pressure method to address the processing challenges associated with high molecular weight polymers. Through this approach, we successfully dissolved high molecular weight D18 in chloroform at 100&#8201;&#176;C within a pressure&#8208;tight vial. The increased steam pressure raised the boiling point and dissolving capacity of chloroform, enabling the creation of a hybrid film with superior properties, including more ordered molecular arrangement, increased crystallinity, extended exciton diffusion length, and improved phase morphology. Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on D18&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO prepared using this high&#8208;pressure method achieved an outstanding power conversion efficiency of 19.65&#8201;%, setting a new record for binary devices to date. Furthermore, this high&#8208;pressure method was successfully applied to fabricate OSCs based on other common systems, leading to significant enhancements in device performance.

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by pressure cooker principles, we employ high-pressure methods to address challenges in processing high molecular weight polymers. Successfully dissolving HW-D18 in chloroform at 100&#8201;&#176;C within pressure vials, heightened vapor pressure elevates boiling point and solubility of chloroform. This enables the creation of blend films with superior properties, ultimately achieving an excellent PCE of 19.65&#8201;%, setting a new record for binary OSCs.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, inspired by the principles of a pressure cooker, we utilized a high-pressure method to address the processing challenges associated with high molecular weight polymers. Through this approach, we successfully dissolved high molecular weight D18 in chloroform at 100&#8201;&#176;C within a pressure-tight vial. The increased steam pressure raised the boiling point and dissolving capacity of chloroform, enabling the creation of a hybrid film with superior properties, including more ordered molecular arrangement, increased crystallinity, extended exciton diffusion length, and improved phase morphology. Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on D18&#8201;:&#8201;L8-BO prepared using this high-pressure method achieved an outstanding power conversion efficiency of 19.65&#8201;%, setting a new record for binary devices to date. Furthermore, this high-pressure method was successfully applied to fabricate OSCs based on other common systems, leading to significant enhancements in device performance. In summary, this research introduces a universal method for processing high molecular weight D18 materials, ultimately resulting in the highest performance reported for binary organic solar cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Back Cover: Locking the Conformation of a Paddlewheel Rhodium Complex: Design, Synthesis, and Applications in Catalytic Nitrene Transfers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two structures of paddlewheel rhodium complexes displaying either syn or anti conformations are shown in the cover picture. Each of them stands on a separated podium, indicating that two conformations are not in an equilibrium and thus not undergo interconversion. The conformational fixation has proven to be useful for the development of selective nitrene transfer catalysts, as demonstrated by Xinxin Tang, Hidetoshi Noda, and Masakatsu Shibasaki in their Research Article (e202311027).

         <title>Neutral and Anionic Square Planar Palladium(0) Complexes Stabilized by a Silicon Z&#8208;Type Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first neutral and anionic square planar (sp) Pd(0) (ate) complexes are synthesized and fully characterized. Such species, which have been proposed as intermediates in Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross coupling reactions, are stabilized using a Si(IV) based Lewis acidic ambiphilic Z&#8208;type ligand, which causes a strong Pd&#8722;Si Z&#8208;type interaction as confirmed by DFT derived methods.







Abstract
Anionic [Pd(0)&#8722;X]&#8722; ate complex were proposed as key intermediates in Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling for decades, but their isolation remained elusive. Herein, a chelating Lewis acidic bis(amidophenolato)silane is introduced as a strong Z&#8208;type ligand which enables the characterization of the first anionic [Pd(0)&#8722;X]&#8722; ate complex. Intriguingly, these compounds and the neutral L&#8722;Pd(0) analogs exhibit a square planar coordination that is highly unusual for a d10 metal. Theoretical methods scrutinize the interaction between the Lewis acidic Si(IV) center and the late transition metal, while reactivity studies shed light on the potential role of anionic additives in oxidative addition reactions.

         <title>Combining Nitridoborates, Nitrides and Hydrides&#8212;Synthesis and Characterization of the Multianionic Sr6N[BN2]2H3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel strontium nitridoborate hydride Sr6N[BN2]2H3 was obtained by a solid&#8208;state synthesis, extending the family of multinary hydrides. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray and neutron powder diffraction data revealed the crystal structure containing nitridoborate, nitride and hydride anions. Impedance spectroscopy shows hydride ion conductivity and MAS NMR as well as vibrational spectroscopy corroborate the structural analysis of our compound.







Abstract
Multianionic metal hydrides, which exhibit a wide variety of physical properties and complex structures, have recently attracted growing interest. Here we present Sr6N[BN2]2H3, prepared in a solid&#8208;state ampoule reaction at 800&#8201;&#176;C, as the first combination of nitridoborate, nitride and hydride anions within a single compound. The crystal structure was solved from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray and neutron powder diffraction data in space group P21/c (no.&#8197;14), revealing a three&#8208;dimensional network of undulated layers of nitridoborate units, strontium atoms and hydride together with nitride anions. Magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR and vibrational spectroscopy in combination with quantum chemical calculations further confirm the structure model. Electrochemical measurements suggest the existence of hydride ion conductivity, allowing the hydrides to migrate along the layers.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Assembled Capsule for Propylene/Propane Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;soluble tetrahedral Fe4L6 metal&#8208;organic cage has been successfully used to separate propane and propylene under ambient conditions. Mixed gases of C3H6 and C3H8 were captured by Fe4L6 at the gas&#8208;liquid interface in a U&#8208;shaped glass tube. Governed by the guest binding affinity, C3H6 is released first after transport of the gases to the receiving arm of the tube.







Abstract
The development of energy&#8208;saving technology for the efficient separation of olefin and paraffin is highly important for the chemical industry. Herein, we report a self&#8208;assembled Fe4L6 capsule containing a hydrophobic cavity, which can be used to encapsulate and separate propylene/propane. The successful encapsulation of propylene and propane by the Fe4L6 cage in a water solution was documented by NMR spectroscopy. The binding constants K for the Fe4L6 cage toward propylene and propane were determined to be (5.0&#177;0.1)&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1 and (2.1&#177;0.7)&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1 in D2O at 25&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. Experiments and theoretical studies revealed that the cage exhibited multiple weak interactions with propylene and propane. The polymer&#8208;grade propylene (&gt;99.5&#8201;%) can be obtained from a mixture of propylene and propane by using the Fe4L6 cage as a separation material in a U&#8208;shaped glass tube. This work provides a new strategy for the separation of olefin/paraffin.

         <title>Rapid Polyolefin Hydrogenolysis by a Single&#8208;Site Organo&#8208;Tantalum Catalyst on a Super&#8208;Acidic Support: Structure and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cationic organo&#8208;tantalum catalyst AlS/TaNp3 (94&#8201;%) and AlS/TaNp2_AlNp (6&#8201;%) was synthesized via Np3Ta=CHtBu chemisorption on Br&#248;nsted acidic sulfated alumina (AlS). The proposed structures are in good agreement with SSNMR, DRIFTS, XANES, EXAFS, and DFT computation. Highly efficient AlS/Ta&#8208;mediated hydrogenolysis of diverse pre&#8208; and post&#8208;consumer polyolefin plastics to lighter alkanes is achieved.







Abstract
The novel electrophilic organo&#8208;tantalum catalyst AlS/TaNpx (1) (Np=neopentyl) is prepared by chemisorption of the alkylidene Np3Ta=CHtBu onto highly Br&#248;nsted acidic sulfated alumina (AlS). The proposed catalyst structure is supported by EXAFS, XANES, ICP, DRIFTS, elemental analysis, and SSNMR measurements and is in good agreement with DFT analysis. Catalyst 1 is highly effective for the hydrogenolysis of diverse linear and branched hydrocarbons, ranging from C2 to polyolefins. To the best of our knowledge, 1 exhibits one of the highest polyolefin hydrogenolysis activities (9,800 (CH2 units)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol(Ta)&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 200&#8201;&#176;C/17&#8197;atm H2) reported to date in the peer&#8208;reviewed literature. Unlike the AlS/ZrNp2 analog, the Ta catalyst is more thermally stable and offers multiple potential C&#8722;C bond activation pathways.

     alt="Rapid Polyolefin Hydrogenolysis by a Single-Site Organo-Tantalum Catalyst on a Super-Acidic Support: Structure and Mechanism"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cationic organo-tantalum catalyst AlS/TaNp&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (94&#8201;%) and AlS/TaNp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;_AlNp (6&#8201;%) was synthesized via Np&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ta=CH&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;Bu chemisorption on Br&#248;nsted acidic sulfated alumina (AlS). The proposed structures are in good agreement with SSNMR, DRIFTS, XANES, EXAFS, and DFT computation. Highly efficient AlS/Ta-mediated hydrogenolysis of diverse pre- and post-consumer polyolefin plastics to lighter alkanes is achieved.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novel electrophilic organo-tantalum catalyst AlS/TaNp&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) (Np=neopentyl) is prepared by chemisorption of the alkylidene Np&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ta=CH&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;Bu onto highly Br&#248;nsted acidic sulfated alumina (AlS). The proposed catalyst structure is supported by EXAFS, XANES, ICP, DRIFTS, elemental analysis, and SSNMR measurements and is in good agreement with DFT analysis. Catalyst &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; is highly effective for the hydrogenolysis of diverse linear and branched hydrocarbons, ranging from C2 to polyolefins. To the best of our knowledge, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; exhibits one of the highest polyolefin hydrogenolysis activities (9,800 (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; units)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol(Ta)&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 200&#8201;&#176;C/17&#8197;atm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) reported to date in the peer-reviewed literature. Unlike the AlS/ZrNp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; analog, the Ta catalyst is more thermally stable and offers multiple potential C&#8722;C bond activation pathways. For hydrogenolysis, AlS/TaNp&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; is effective for a wide variety of pre- and post-consumer polyolefin plastics and is not significantly deactivated by standard polyolefin additives at typical industrial concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Symmetry and Rigidity for Boosting Erbium&#8208;Based Molecular Light&#8208;Upconversion in Solution</title>

         <dc:description>
Moving from homoleptic triple helical erbium complexes to heteroleptic adducts boosts the quantum yield of near&#8208;infrared to visible molecular&#8208;based light&#8208;upconversion by three orders of magnitude in solution at room temperature.







Abstract
Previously limited to highly symmetrical homoleptic triple&#8208;helical complexes [Er(Lk)3]3+, where Lk are polyaromatic tridentate ligands, single&#8208;center molecular&#8208;based upconversion using linear optics and exploiting the excited&#8208;state absorption mechanism (ESA) greatly benefits from the design of stable and low&#8208;symmetrical [LkEr(hfa)3] heteroleptic adducts (hfa&#8722;=hexafluoroacetylacetonate anion). Depending on (i) the extended &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, (ii) the flexibility and (iii) the heavy atom effect brought by the bound ligand Lk, the near&#8208;infrared (801&#8197;nm) to visible green (542&#8197;nm) upconversion quantum yield measured for [LkEr(hfa)3] in solution at room temperature can be boosted by up to three orders of magnitude.

         <title>A Subtle Change in the Flexible Achiral Spacer Does Matter in Supramolecular Chirality: Two&#8208;Fold Odd&#8208;Even Effect in Polymer Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Negligible changes of flexible spacers enable remarkable change of supramolecular chirality and anisotropic topology in azobenzene polymer assemblies. The phase transition from amorphous to LC phase can cause the chiroptical inversion in supramolecular assemblies, leading to two types of chiral arrangements with opposite helicity.







Abstract
Precise control over the chirality and morphologies of polymer assemblies, a remaining challenge for both chemists and materials scientists, is receiving ever&#8208;increasing attention in the recent years. Herein, we report the subtle manipulation of the achiral spacers from the chiral stereocenter to the azobenzene (Azo) unit, of which the chiroptical consistency or chiroptical inversion of self&#8208;assemblies could be successfully controlled and present &#8220;two&#8208;fold&#8221; odd&#8208;even effect. Furthermore, morphological transitions from 0D spherical micelles, 1D worms, and nanowires to 3D vesicles, spindle&#8208; and dumbbell&#8208;shaped vesicles were also unexpectedly found to exhibit odd&#8208;even correlations. These observations were collectively elucidated by mesomorphic properties, stacking modes, chiroptical dynamics, and stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviors. Negligible modifications to the spacer structures can enable remarkable modulation of supramolecular chirality and anisotropic topologies in polymer assemblies, which is of great significance for the design of complex chiral functional polymers.

         <title>Single&#8208;Scan Ultraselective NMR Experiments with Preserved Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;scan ultraselective experiments, based on the GEMSTONE (gradient&#8208;enhanced multiplet&#8208;selective targeted&#8208;observation NMR experiment) element, are a powerful approach to extract detailed information from complex NMR spectra. We describe an approach allowing to dramatically reduce signal losses due to translational diffusion, for applications to structure elucidation and mixture analysis.







Abstract
Selective NMR experiments provide rapid access to important structural information, and are essential to tackle the analysis of large molecules and complex mixtures. Single&#8208;scan ultraselective experiments are particularly useful, as they can rapidly select signals that overlap with other signals. Here, we describe a novel type of single&#8208;scan ultraselective NMR experiments that is robust against the effects of translational molecular diffusion, and thus make it possible to improve significantly the sensitivity of the experiment. This will largely broaden the applicability of this powerful class of experiments.

         <title>T Cell Antigen Recognition and Discrimination by Electrochemiluminescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a label&#8208;free approach for imaging immune synapses of T cells by electrochemiluminescence microscopy, which allows us to discriminate specific T cell receptor (TCR)/peptide&#8208;loaded major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) recognition, as well as the role of auxiliary molecules (costimulatory and adhesion molecules). The results would be useful in the development of tumour vaccines and adoptive T cell transfer immunotherapy.







Abstract
Adoptive T lymphocyte (T cell) transfer and tumour&#8208;specific peptide vaccines are innovative cancer therapies. An accurate assessment of the specific reactivity of T cell receptors (TCRs) to tumour antigens is required because of the high heterogeneity of tumour cells and the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment. In this study, we report a label&#8208;free electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging approach for recognising and discriminating between TCRs and tumour&#8208;specific antigens by imaging the immune synapses of T cells. Various T cell stimuli, including agonistic antibodies, auxiliary molecules, and tumour&#8208;specific antigens, were modified on the electrode's surface to allow for their interaction with T cells bearing different TCRs. The formation of immune synapses activated by specific stimuli produced a negative (shadow) ECL image, from which T cell antigen recognition and discrimination were evaluated by analysing the spreading area and the recognition intensity of T cells. This approach provides an easy way to assess TCR&#8208;antigen specificity and screen both of them for immunotherapies.

         <title>Designing Sulfate Crystals with Strong Optical Anisotropy through &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Tailoring</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The optical anisotropy of sulfate optical materials can be significantly enhanced by strategically tailoring the isotropic [SO4]2&#8722; tetrahedra with &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic modules.







Abstract
Sulfate crystals typically exhibit minimal optical anisotropy due to the near&#8208;zero polarizability anisotropy (&#948;) of [SO4]2&#8722; tetrahedra, arising from highly symmetrical electron clouds. Recent research sought to enhance &#948; via chemical modifications, such as fluorination. However, the resultant crystals often maintain subpar optical anisotropy, frequently with birefringence values below 0.1. In this study, we have uncovered that &#948; can be significantly strengthened by chemically tailoring the tetrahedral [SO4]2&#8722; with anisotropic &#960;&#8208;conjugated modules. This has been demonstrated by several newly proposed S&#8722;O&#8208;Org (Org: &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic species) moieties, which show a sharp increase in &#948; based on theoretical computations. To further validate this experimentally, we synthesized and characterized six new 3&#8208;pyridinesulfonate crystals with the formula A(3&#8208;C5H4NSO3)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xH2O (A=Li, Ag, K, Rb, Cs, and NH4; x=0 and 1). Notably, these materials exhibit strong optical anisotropy, with birefringence values ranging from 0.240 to 0.312 at 546&#8197;nm. These values are approximately 23 to 145.5 times greater than those of corresponding sulfates, and they outperform a vast number of sulfate&#8208;related optical materials, thus verifying the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Furthermore, the title compounds exhibit diverse microstructure peculiarities influenced by the size and binding natures of the counter cations.

&lt;p&gt;Sulfate crystals typically exhibit minimal optical anisotropy due to the near-zero polarizability anisotropy (&#948;) of [SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; tetrahedra, arising from highly symmetrical electron clouds. Recent research sought to enhance &#948; via chemical modifications, such as fluorination. However, the resultant crystals often maintain subpar optical anisotropy, frequently with birefringence values below 0.1. In this study, we have uncovered that &#948; can be significantly strengthened by chemically tailoring the tetrahedral [SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; with anisotropic &#960;-conjugated modules. This has been demonstrated by several newly proposed S&#8722;O-Org (Org: &#960;-conjugated organic species) moieties, which show a sharp increase in &#948; based on theoretical computations. To further validate this experimentally, we synthesized and characterized six new 3-pyridinesulfonate crystals with the formula A(3-C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;NSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (A=Li, Ag, K, Rb, Cs, and NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;; &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;=0 and 1). Notably, these materials exhibit strong optical anisotropy, with birefringence values ranging from 0.240 to 0.312 at 546&#8197;nm. These values are approximately 23 to 145.5 times greater than those of corresponding sulfates, and they outperform a vast number of sulfate-related optical materials, thus verifying the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Furthermore, the title compounds exhibit diverse microstructure peculiarities influenced by the size and binding natures of the counter cations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inside Cover: Reconfigurable Photonic Crystal Reversibly Exhibiting Single and Double Structural Colors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photonic crystals can display vivid structural colors via a selective reflection of visible light, and designing their spectra remains a challenge. In their Communication (e202311451), Koki Sano, Yasuhiro Ishida et&#8197;al. report a reconfigurable photonic crystal consisting of an aqueous dispersion of inorganic nanosheets that reversibly exhibits single&#8208;peak and double&#8208;peak structural colors when annealed under homogeneous and gradient temperature conditions, respectively.

         <title>Macrocyclic Encapsulation in a Non&#8208;fused Tetrathiophene Acceptor for Efficient Organic Solar Cells with High Short&#8208;Circuit Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;fullerene acceptors have shown great promise for organic solar cells (OSCs). However, challenges in achieving high efficiency molecular system with conformational unicity and effective molecular stacking remain. In this study, we present a new design of non&#8208;fused tetrathiophene acceptor R4T&#8208;1 via employing the encapsulation of tetrathiophene with macrocyclic ring. The single crystal structure analysis reveals that cyclic alkyl side chains can perfectly encapsulate the central part of molecule and generate a conformational stable and planar molecular backbone. Whereas, the control 4T&#8208;5 without the encapsulation restriction displays cis&#8208; and twisted conformation. As a result, R4T&#8208;1 based OSCs achieved an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 15.10% with a high short&#8208;circuit current density (JSC) of 25.48 mA/cm2, which is significantly improved by ~30% in relative to that of the control. Our findings demonstrate that the macrocyclic encapsulation strategy could assist fully non&#8208;fused electron acceptors (FNEAs) to achieve a high photovoltaic performance and pave a new way for FNEAs design.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Near&#8208;Infrared Chlorinated Rylenecarboximide Fluorophores via Consecutive C&#8208;N and C&#8208;C Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new class of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores, PAI, is obtained by consecutive C&#8208;N/C&#8208;C bond formation between diphenylamines and 9,10&#8208;dibromoperylenecarboximide. Owing to the rigid structure, extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and pronounced push&#8208;pull substitution, these fluorophores show emission maxima up to 804 nm and large Stokes shifts. The extraordinarily high fluorescence quantum yields from 47% to 70% are attributed to chloro substitution in the bay positions of the perylene core. These characteristics, together with high photostability, qualify them as useful NIR emitters for applications as biomarkers and security inks.</dc:description>

         <title>Production of Biobased Ethylbenzene by&#160;Cascade Biocatalysis with&#160;an Engineered Photodecarboxylase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Production of commodity chemicals, such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX), from renewable resources is key for a sustainable society. Biocatalysis enables one&#8208;pot multistep transformation of bioresources under mild conditions, yet it is often limited to biochemicals. Herein, we developed a non&#8208;natural three&#8208;enzyme cascade for one&#8208;pot conversion of biobased l&#8208;phenylalanine into ethylbenzene. The key rate&#8208;limiting photodecarboxylase was subjected to structure&#8208;guided semi&#8208;rational engineering and a triple mutant CvFAP(Y466T/P460A/G462I) was obtained with a 6.3&#8208;fold higher productivity. With this improved photodecarboxylase, an optimized two&#8208;cell sequential process was developed to convert l&#8208;phenylalanine into ethylbenzene with 82% conversion. The cascade reaction was integrated with fermentation to achieve a one&#8208;pot bioproduction of ethylbenzene from biobased glycerol, demonstrating the potential of cascade biocatalysis plus enzyme engineering for the production of biobased commodity chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Continuous Nanospace in Nanoporous Liquid Crystal Investigated by 129Xe NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Continuous nanopores within fluid materials could be used for novel chemical events such as the accommodation of guest molecules, unique arrays of the entrapped molecules, and chemical reactions in a dynamic molecular assembly. Columnar liquid crystals composed of a one&#8208;dimensionally stacked assembly of shape&#8208;persistent macrocycles form nanochannels owing to the intrinsic nanospace in the column. However, the existence of substantial nanoporosity has not been confirmed experimentally thus far. In this study, for the first time in the literature, we confirmed the presence of discrete and spatiotemporally continuous voids in a liquid&#8208;crystalline material. In 129Xe NMR spectroscopy of liquid crystalline columnar assembly of imine&#8208;bridged shape&#8208;persistent macrocycles under Xe atmosphere, the NMR signals of the Xe atoms entrapped in the liquid&#8208;crystalline macrocycle depended on the gas pressure and phase&#8208;transition temperatures. These results indicate that the encapsulation of Xe gas molecules within the discrete and oriented nanospaces of nanoporous liquid crystals is different from the homogeneous dissolution of the solute in an ordinary solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;Based Macroscopic Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The click reaction has found good utility across various fields due to the characteristics of high efficiency, atom economy, simple and mild reaction conditions. Click chemistry is usually utilized for connecting components of microscopic level, while it is still unable for joining macroscopic building blocks. Materials consisting of macroscopic building blocks realize the flexible fabrication of three&#8208;dimensional structures at macroscopic level, exerting significance on parallel manufactures. In this work, we reported macroscopic click chemistry utilizing hydrogel as macroscopic building blocks. Hydrogels G1 and G2 were prepared by incorporating M1 (N,N'&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;ethanediamine) and P1 (alkyne functionalized polyethylene glycol) respectively, where polymer chains formed through diffusion&#8208;induced amino&#8208;yne click reaction entangled different hydrogel networks together. Additionally, chain&#8208;like aggregates and complicated 3D structures such as tetrahedron and quadrangular pyramid were constructed based on the adhesion of the hydrogel blocks. The approach enables us to find more possibilities in the delicate designation of 3D aggregations as well as large&#8208;scale manufacturing.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a mild, catalytic method for the intermolecular reductive coupling of feedstock dienes and styrenes with ketones. Our conditions allow concomitant formation of a cobalt hydride species and single&#8208;electron&#8208;reduction of ketones. Subsequent selective hydrogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer from the cobalt hydride generates an allylic radical which can selectively couple with the persistent radical&#8208;anion of the ketone. This radical&#8208;radical coupling negates unfavourable steric interactions of ionic pathways and avoids the unstable alkoxy&#8208;radical of previous radical olefin&#8208;carbonyl couplings which were limited, as a result, to aldehydes. Applications of this novel and straightforward approach include the efficient synthesis of drug&#8208;molecules, key&#8208;intermediates in drug synthesis and site&#8208;selective late&#8208;stage functionalisation.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox Nickel&#8208;Catalysed Stille Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Stille cross&#8208;coupling reaction is one of the most common strategies for the construction of C&#8211;C bonds. Despite notable strides in the advancement of the Stille reaction, persistent challenges persist in hindering its greener evolution. These challenges encompass multiple facets, such as the high cost of precious metals and ligands, the demand for various additives, and the slow reaction rate. In comparison to the dominant palladium&#8208;catalysed Stille reactions, cost&#8208;effective nickel&#8208;catalysed systems lag behind, and enantioconvergent Stille reactions of racemic stannanes remain undeveloped. Herein, we present a pioneering instance of nickel&#8208;catalysed enantioconvergent Stille cross&#8208;coupling reactions of racemic stannane reagents, resulting in the formation of C&#8211;C bonds in good to high yields with excellent stereoselectivity. This strategy provides a practical, scalable, and operationally straightforward method for the synthesis of C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp3), C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp2), and C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp) bonds under exceptionally mild conditions (without additives and bases, ambient temperature). The innovative use of synergistic photoredox/nickel catalysis enables a novel single&#8208;electron transmetalation process of stannane reagents, providing a new research paradigm of Stille reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Iron Regulating Electronic Structure of Iron Atom Clusters for Electrocatalytic H2O2 Production and Biomass Upgrading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The integration of highly active single atoms (SAs) and atom clusters (ACs) into an electrocatalyst is critically important for high&#8208;efficiency two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8208; ORR) to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Here we report a tandem impregnation&#8208;pyrolysis&#8208;etching strategy to fabricate the oxygen&#8208;coordinated Fe SAs and ACs anchored on bacterial cellulose derived carbon (BCC) (FeSAs/ACs&#8208;BCC). As the electrocatalyst, FeSAs/ACs&#8208;BCC exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity and selectivity toward 2e&#8208; ORR, affording an onset potential of 0.78 V (vs. RHE) and a high H2O2 selectivity of 96.5% in 0.1 M KOH. In a flow cell reactor, the FeSAs/ACs&#8208;BCC also achieves high&#8208;efficiency H2O2 production with a yield rate of 12.51 &#177; 0.18 mol gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 and a faradaic efficiency of 89.4% &#177; 1.3% at 150 mA cm&#8208;2. Additionally, the feasibility of coupling the produced H2O2 and electro&#8208;Fenton process for the valorization of ethylene glycol was explored in detail. The theoretical calculations uncover that the oxygen&#8208;coordinated Fe SAs effectively regulate the electronic structure of Fe ACs which are the 2e&#8208; ORR active sites, resulting in the optimal binding strength of *OOH intermediate for high&#8208;efficiency H2O2 production.</dc:description>

         <title>Mobility&#8208;Modulated Sequential Dissociation Analysis Enables Structural Lipidomics in Mass Spectrometry Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spatial lipidomics based on mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful tool for fundamental biology studies and biomarker discovery. But the structure&#8208;resolving capability of MSI is limited because of the lack of multiplexed tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) method, primarily due to the small sample amount available from each pixel and the poor ion usage in MS/MS analysis. Here, we report a mobility&#8208;modulated sequential dissociation (MMSD) strategy for multiplex MS/MS imaging of distinct lipids from biological tissues. With ion mobility&#8208;enabled data&#8208;independent acquisition and automated spectrum deconvolution, MS/MS spectra of a large number of lipid species from each tissue pixel are acquired, at no expense of imaging speed. MMSD imaging is highlighted by MS/MS imaging of 24 structurally distinct lipids in the mouse brain and the revealing of the correlation of a structurally distinct phosphatidylethanolamine isomer (PE 18:1_18:1) from a human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue. Mapping of structurally distinct lipid isomers is now enabled and spatial lipidomics becomes feasible for MSI.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoelectrochemistry&#160;is becoming&#160;an innovative&#160;approach to organic synthesis. Generally, the current photoelectrocatalytic organic transformations suffer from limited reaction type, low conversion efficiency and poor stability.&#160;Herein, we develop efficient and stable photoelectrode materials using metal oxide protective layer, with a focus on achieving regioselective activation of&#160;amine compounds.&#160;Notably,&#160;our photoelectrochemistry&#160;process is implemented&#160;under mild reaction conditions and does not involve any directing groups, transition metals or oxidants. The results demonstrate that&#160;beyond photocatalysis and electrocatalysis,&#160;photoelectrocatalysis&#160;exhibits high efficiency, remarkable repeatability&#160;and good functional group tolerance, highlighting its great potential for applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Generation of Aromatic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Radicals for Functionalization of Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals (NCRs) have been widely recognized as versatile synthetic intermediates for the construction of nitrogen containing molecules of high value. As such, there has been a long&#8208;standing interest in the field of organic synthesis to develop novel nitrogen&#8208;based radicals and explore their inherent reactivity. In this study, we present the generation of aromatic N&#8208;heterocyclic radicals and their application in a novel and diverse functionalization of unactivated alkenes. Bench&#8208;stable aromatic N&#8208;heterocyclic pyridinium salts were employed as crucial NCR precursors, which enabled the efficient conversion of various unactivated alkenes into medicinally relevant alkylated N&#8208;heterocyclic amines. This approach offers an unexplored retrosynthetic disconnection for the synthesis of related molecules that commonly possess therapeutic value. Furthermore, this platform can be extended to the synthesis of densely functionalized heterocyclic amines by utilizing disulfides and diethyl bromomalonate as radical quenchers. Mechanistic investigations indicate an energy transfer (EnT) pathway involving the formation of a transient aromatic N&#8208;heterocyclic radical, radical addition to unactivated alkenes, and subsequent generation of the amination product through either hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) or radical addition processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Particle Engineering via Supramolecular Assembly of Macroscopic Hydrophobic Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tailoring the hydrophobicity of supramolecular assembly building blocks enables the fabrication of well&#8208;defined functional materials. However, the selection of building blocks used in the assembly of metal&#8211;phenolic networks (MPNs), an emerging supramolecular assembly platform for particle engineering, has been essentially limited to hydrophilic molecules. Herein, we synthesized and applied biscatechol&#8208;functionalized hydrophobic polymers (poly(methyl acrylate) (PMA) and poly(butyl acrylate) (PBA)) as building blocks to engineer MPN particle systems (particles and capsules).&#160;Our method allowed control over the shell thickness (e.g., between 10 and 21 nm), stiffness (e.g., from 10 to 126 mN m&#8211;1), and permeability (e.g., 28&#8211;72% capsules were permeable to 500 kDa fluorescein isothiocyanate&#8208;dextran) of the MPN capsules by selecting hydrophobic polymer building blocks (PMA or PBA) and controlling the polymer concentration in the MPN assembly solution (0.25&#8211;2.0 mM) without additional/engineered assembly processes. Molecular dynamics simulations provided insights in the structural states of the hydrophobic building blocks during assembly and mechanism of film formation. Furthermore, the hydrophobic MPNs facilitated the preparation of fluorescent&#8208;labeled and bioactive capsules through postfunctionalization and particle&#8211;cell association engineering by controlling the hydrophobicity of the building blocks. Engineering MPN particle systems via building block hydrophobicity is expected to expand their use.</dc:description>

Herein, we synthesized and applied biscatechol-functionalized hydrophobic polymers (poly(methyl acrylate) (PMA) and poly(butyl acrylate) (PBA)) as building blocks to engineer MPN particle systems (particles and capsules).&#160;Our method allowed control over the shell thickness (e.g., between 10 and 21 nm), stiffness (e.g., from 10 to 126 mN m&#8211;1), and permeability (e.g., 28&#8211;72% capsules were permeable to 500 kDa fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran) of the MPN capsules by selecting hydrophobic polymer building blocks (PMA or PBA) and controlling the polymer concentration in the MPN assembly solution (0.25&#8211;2.0 mM) without additional/engineered assembly processes. Molecular dynamics simulations provided insights in the structural states of the hydrophobic building blocks during assembly and mechanism of film formation. Furthermore, the hydrophobic MPNs facilitated the preparation of fluorescent-labeled and bioactive capsules through postfunctionalization and particle&#8211;cell association engineering by controlling the hydrophobicity of the building blocks. Engineering MPN particle systems via building block hydrophobicity is expected to expand their use.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Based Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks (HOFs) with Brilliant Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By synergistically employing four key strategies: (I) introducing tetraphenylethylene groups as the central core unit with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties, (II) optimizing the &#960;&#8208;conjugated length by extending the building block branches, (III) incorporating flexible groups containing ethylenic bonds, and (IV) applying crystal engineering to attain dense stacking mode and highly twisty conformation, we successfully synthesized a series of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) exhibiting exceptional one/two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence. Notably, when utilizing the fluorescently superior building block L2, HOF&#8208;LIFM&#8208;7 and HOF&#8208;LIFM&#8208;8 exhibiting high quantum yields (QY) of 82.1% and 77.1%, and ultrahigh two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) cross&#8208;sections of 148959.5 GM and 123901.1 GM were achieved. These materials were successfully employed in one and two&#8208;photon excited lysosome&#8208;targeting cellular imaging. It is believed that this strategy, combining building block optimization and crystal engineering, holds significant potential for guiding the development of outstanding fluorescent HOF materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Azide Ionic Liquids for Safe, Green, and Highly&#8208;Efficient Azidation Reactions to Produce Azide Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azide compounds are widely used and especially, polymers bearing pendant azide groups are highly desired in numerous fields. However, harsh reaction conditions are always mandatory to achieve full azidation, causing severe side reactions and degradation of the polymers. Herein, we report the design and preparation of two azide ionic liquids (AILs) with azide anion and triethylene glycol (E3)&#8208;containing cation, [P444E3][N3] and [MIME3][N3]. Compared with the traditional sodium azide (NaN3) approach, both AILs showed much higher reaction rates and functional&#8208;group tolerance. More importantly, they could act as both reagents and solvents for the quantitative azidation of various polymeric precursors under mild conditions. Theoretical simulations suggested that the outstanding performance of AILs originated from the existence of ion pairs during the reaction, and the E3 moieties played a crucial role. Lastly, after the reaction, the AILs could be easily regenerated, presenting a safer, greener, and highly efficient synthesis route for azide polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Importing Antibonding&#8208;Orbital Occupancy through Pd&#8208;O&#8208;Gd Bridge Promotes Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The active&#8208;site density, intrinsic activity, and durability of Pd&#8208;based materials for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are critical to their application in industrial energy devices. This work constructs a series of carbon&#8208;based rare&#8208;earth (RE) oxides (Gd2O3, Sm2O3, Eu2O3, and CeO2) by using RE metal&#8208;organic frameworks to tune the ORR performance of the Pd sites through the Pd&#8208;RExOy interface interaction. Taking Pd&#8208;Gd2O3/C as a representative, it is identified that the strong coupling between Pd and Gd2O3 induces the formation of the Pd&#8208;O&#8208;Gd bridge, which triggers charge redistribution of Pd and Gd2O3. The screened Pd&#8208;Gd2O3/C exhibits impressive ORR performance with high onset potential (0.986 VRHE), half&#8208;wave potential (0.877 VRHE), and excellent stability. Similar ORR results are also found for Pd&#8208;Sm2O3/C, Pd&#8208;Eu2O3/C, and Pd&#8208;CeO2/C catalysts. Theoretical analyses reveal that the coupling between Pd and Gd2O3 promotes electron transfer through the Pd&#8208;O&#8208;Gd bridge, which induces the antibonding&#8208;orbital occupancy of Pd&#8208;*OH for the optimization of *OH adsorption in the rate&#8208;determining step of ORR. The pH&#8208;dependent microkinetic modeling shows that Pd&#8208;Gd2O3 is close to the theoretical optimal activity for ORR, outperforming Pt under the same conditions. By its ascendancy in ORR, the Pd&#8208;Gd2O3/C exhibits superior performance in Zn&#8208;air battery as an air cathode, implying its excellent practicability.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetra&#8208; and Hexavalent Siglec&#8208;8 Ligands Modulate Immune Cell Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbohydrate&#8208;binding proteins are generally characterized by poor affinities for their natural glycan ligands, predominantly due to the shallow and solvent&#8208;exposed binding sites. To overcome this drawback, nature has exploited multivalency to strengthen the binding by establishing multiple interactions simultaneously. The development of oligovalent structures frequently proved to be successful, not only for proteins with multiple binding sites, but also for proteins that possess a single recognition domain. Here we present the syntheses of a number of oligovalent ligands for Siglec&#8208;8, a monomeric I&#8208;type lectin found on eosinophils and mast cells, alongside the thermodynamic characterization of their binding. While the enthalpic contribution of each binding epitope was within a narrow range to the one of the monomeric ligand, the entropy penalty increases steadily with growing valency. Additionally, we observed a successful agonistic binding of the tetra&#8208; and hexavalent and, to an even larger extent, multivalent ligands to Siglec&#8208;8 on immune cells and modulation of immune cell activation. Thus, triggering a biological effect is not restricted to multivalent ligands but could be induced by low oligovalent ligands as well, whereas a monovalent ligand, despite binding with similar affinity, showed an antagonistic effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring Peptido&#8208;Nanocomposites in the Context of Amyloid Diseases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Therapeutic peptides are a major class of pharmaceutical drugs owing to their target&#8208;binding specificity as well as their versatility in inhibiting aberrant protein&#8208;protein interactions associated with human pathologies. Within the realm of amyloid diseases, the use of peptides and peptidomimetics tailor&#8208;designed to overcome amyloidogenesis has been an active research endeavor since the late 90s. In more recent years, incorporating nanoparticles for enhancing the biocirculation and delivery of peptide drugs has emerged as a frontier in nanomedicine, and nanoparticles have further demonstrated a potency against amyloid aggregation and cellular inflammation to rival strategies employing small molecules, peptides, and antibodies. Despite these efforts, however, a fundamental understanding of the chemistry, characteristics and function of peptido&#8208;nanocomposites is lacking, and a systematic analysis of such strategy for combating a range of amyloid pathogeneses is missing. Here we review the history, principles and evolving chemistry of constructing peptido&#8208;nanocomposites from bottom up and discuss their future application against amyloid diseases that debilitate a significant portion of the global population.</dc:description>

         <title>Favoring CO Intermediate Stabilization and Protonation by Crown Ether for CO2 Electromethanation in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhancing CO2 electroreduction in acidic media is reported via anchoring potassium ions near the Cu electrode decorated with an 18&#8208;Crown&#8208;6 molecule. This strategy could simultaneously favor *CO intermediate stabilization and protonation to improve the CH4 selectivity and CO2 utilization efficiency.







Abstract
The large&#8208;scale deployment of CO2 electroreduction is hampered by deficient carbon utilization in neutral and alkaline electrolytes due to CO2 loss into (bi)carbonates. Switching to acidic media mitigates carbonation, but suffers from low product selectivity because of hydrogen evolution. Here we report a crown ether decoration strategy on a Cu catalyst to enhance carbon utilization and selectivity of CO2 methanation under acidic conditions. Macrocyclic 18&#8208;Crown&#8208;6 is found to enrich potassium cations near the Cu electrode surface, simultaneously enhancing the interfacial electric field to stabilize the *CO intermediate and accelerate water dissociation to boost *CO protonation. Remarkably, the mixture of 18&#8208;Crown&#8208;6 and Cu nanoparticles affords a CH4 Faradaic efficiency of 51.2&#8201;% and a single pass carbon efficiency of 43.0&#8201;% toward CO2 electroreduction in electrolyte with pH=2. This study provides a facile strategy to promote CH4 selectivity and carbon utilization by modifying Cu catalysts with supramolecules.

Human&#8208;AI collaborative platform for synergistic design&#8208;synthesis&#8208;analysis workflow of SAHCs by integration of human&#8208;led atomistic insights with data&#8208;driven augmented toolbox towards accomplishing ultimate reality&#8208;enabled SAHCs manufacturing with atomic economy.







Abstract
Heterogeneous catalysts with targeted functionality can be designed with atomic precision, but it is challenging to retain the structure and performance upon the scaled&#8208;up manufacturing. Particularly challenging is to ensure the &#8220;atomic economy&#8221;, where every catalytic site is most gainfully utilized. Given the emerging synergistic integration of human&#8208; and artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;driven augmented designs (AD), augmented analytics (AA), and augmented reality manufacturing (AM) platforms, this minireview focuses on single&#8208;atom heterogeneous catalysts (SAHCs) and examines the current status, challenges, and future perspectives of translating atomic&#8208;level structural precision and data&#8208;driven discovery to next&#8208;generation industrial manufacturing. We critically examine the atomistic insights into structure&#8208;driven SAHCs functionality and discuss the opportunities and challenges on the way towards the synergistic human&#8208;AI collaborative data&#8208;driven platform capable of monitoring, analyzing, manufacturing, and retaining the atomic&#8208;scale structure and functions. Enhanced by the atomic&#8208;level AD, AA, and AM, evolving from the current high&#8208;throughput capabilities and digital materials manufacturing acceleration, this synergistic human&#8208;AI platform is promising to enable atom&#8208;efficient and atomically precise heterogeneous catalyst production.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Olefins on a Silicon Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The binding of N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins to a silicon surface is investigated revealing an adsorption in the ylide form drastically depending on the N&#8208;substituents. Large N&#8208;substituents lead to upright molecules and ordered monolayers while for small N&#8208;substituents a flat&#8208;lying geometry is favored. The geometry is found to have a strong influence on the properties of the films, e.g. their work function.







Abstract
The adsorption of N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs) on silicon is investigated in a combined scanning tunneling microscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and density functional theory study. We find that both of the studied NHOs bind covalently, with ylidic character, to the silicon adatoms of the substrate and exhibit good thermal stability. The adsorption geometry strongly depends on the N&#8208;substituents: for large N&#8208;substituents, an upright adsorption geometry is favored, while a flat&#8208;lying geometry is found for the NHO with smaller wingtips. These different geometries strongly influence the quality and properties of the obtained monolayers. The upright geometry leads to the formation of ordered monolayers, whereas the flat&#8208;lying NHOs yield a mostly disordered, but denser, monolayer. The obtained monolayers both show large work function reductions, as the higher density of the flat&#8208;lying monolayer is found to compensate for the smaller vertical dipole moments. Our findings offer new prospects in the design of tailor&#8208;made ligand structures in organic electronics and optoelectronics, catalysis, and material science.

         <title>Dynamic Stereochemistry of M8Pd6 Supramolecular Cages Based on Metal&#8208;Center Lability for Differential Chiral Induction, Resolution, and Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four multi&#8208;pocket isostructural M8Pd6 supramolecular cages were assembled that display distinct metal&#8208;center lability and distinguishable stereochemical dynamics leading to chiral transitions and differential guest induction. These results offer insights for the design of chiral metal&#8208;organic cages and applications in chiral sensing and asymmetric transformation.







Abstract
A series of isostructural supramolecular cages with a rhombic dodecahedron shape have been assembled with distinct metal&#8208;coordination lability (M8Pd6&#8208;MOC&#8208;16, M=Ru2+, Fe2+, Ni2+, Zn2+). The chirality transfer between metal centers generally imposes homochirality on individual cages to enable solvent&#8208;dependent spontaneous resolution of &#916;8/&#923;8&#8722;M8Pd6 enantiomers; however, their distinguishable stereochemical dynamics manifests differential chiral phenomena governed by the cage stability following the order Ru8Pd6&gt;Ni8Pd6&gt;Fe8Pd6&gt;Zn8Pd6. The highly labile Zn centers endow the Zn8Pd6 cage with conformational flexibility and deformation, enabling intrigue chiral&#8208;&#916;8/&#923;8&#8722;Zn8Pd6 to meso&#8208;&#916;4&#923;4&#8722;Zn8Pd6 transition induced by anions. The cage stabilization effect differs from inert Ru2+, metastable Fe2+/Ni2+, and labile Zn2+, resulting in different chiral&#8208;guest induction. Strikingly, solvent&#8208;mediated host&#8211;guest interactions have been revealed for &#916;8/&#923;8&#8722;(Ru/Ni/Fe)8Pd6 cages to discriminate the chiral recognition of the guests with opposite chirality. These results demonstrate a versatile procedure to control the stereochemistry of metal&#8208;organic cages based on the dynamic metal centers, thus providing guidance to maneuver cage chirality at a supramolecular level by virtue of the solvent, anion, and guest to benefit practical applications.

         <title>Nanofibers in Organelles: From Structure Design to Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unique stimuli in organelles could trigger in situ self&#8208;assembly of nanofibers with ordered structures, thus exhibiting differential influences on cells. In this minireview, we feature nanofibers in organelles, highlight their formation mechanism and triggering strategies, and discuss the biomedical applications and current challenges.







Abstract
Nanofibers are one of the most important morphologies of molecular self&#8208;assemblies, the formation of which relies on the diverse intermolecular interactions of fibrous&#8208;forming units. In the past decade, rapid advances have been made in the biomedical application of nanofibers, such as bioimaging and tumor treatment. An important topic to be focused on is not only the nanofiber formation mechanism but also where it forms, because different destinations could have different influences on cells and its formation could be triggered by unique stimuli in organelles.

&lt;p&gt;Unique stimuli in organelles could trigger in situ self-assembly of nanofibers with ordered structures, thus exhibiting differential influences on cells. In this minireview, we feature nanofibers in organelles, highlight their formation mechanism and triggering strategies, and discuss the biomedical applications and current challenges.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanofibers are one of the most important morphologies of molecular self-assemblies, the formation of which relies on the diverse intermolecular interactions of fibrous-forming units. In the past decade, rapid advances have been made in the biomedical application of nanofibers, such as bioimaging and tumor treatment. An important topic to be focused on is not only the nanofiber formation mechanism but also where it forms, because different destinations could have different influences on cells and its formation could be triggered by unique stimuli in organelles. It is therefore necessary and timely to summarize the nanofibers assembled in organelles. This minireview discusses the formation mechanism, triggering strategies, and biomedical applications of nanofibers, which may facilitate the rational design of nanofibers, improve our understanding of the relationship between nanofiber properties and organelle characteristics, allow a comprehensive recognition of organelles affected by materials, and enhance the therapeutic efficiency of nanofibers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Sites and Ligation in Amine&#8208;capped CdSe Nanocrystals
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amine ligands have been widely used to tailor surface properties of colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) for facilitating their synthesis, performances and processing, but detailed understanding of their interaction has remained a challenge. Here, a strategy based on detecting 113Cd, 77Se and 15N NMR signatures augmented with DFT modeling was developed. It enables to identify distinct surface sites and the corresponding ligation of amines in CdSe NCs.







Abstract
Converting colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) into devices for various applications is facilitated by designing and controlling their surface properties. One key strategy for tailoring surface properties is thus to choose tailored surface ligands. In that context, amines have been universally used, with the goal to improve NCs synthesis, processing and performances. However, understanding the nature of surface sites in amine&#8208;capped NCs remains challenging, due to the complex surface compositions as well as surface ligands dynamic. Here, we investigate both surface sites and amine ligation in CdSe NCs by combining advanced NMR spectroscopy and computational modelling. Notably, dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) enhanced 113Cd and 77Se 1D NMR helps to identify both bulk and surface sites of NCs, while 113Cd 2D NMR spectroscopy enables to resolve amines terminated sites on both Se&#8208;rich and nonpolar surfaces. In addition to directly bonding to surface sites, amines are shown to also interact through hydrogen&#8208;bonding with absorbed water as revealed by 15N NMR, augmented with computations. The characterization methodology developed for this work provides unique molecular&#8208;level insight into the surface sites of a range of amine&#8208;capped CdSe NCs, and paves the way to identify structure&#8208;function relationships and rational approaches towards colloidal NCs with tailored properties.

         <title>Electrochemical Modification of Polypeptides at Selenocysteine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical selenoetherification (e&#8208;SE) methodology that enables efficient and selective functionalization of polypeptides is described. e&#8208;SE employs mild reaction conditions to facilitate the formation of stable selenoether&#8208;linked conjugates through contraction of diselenide bonds. Compatibility with diverse functionalities and complex cargoes is demonstrated through assembly of valuable bioactive polypeptide conjugates.







Abstract
Mild strategies for the selective modification of peptides and proteins are in demand for applications in therapeutic peptide and protein discovery, and in the study of fundamental biomolecular processes. Herein, we describe the development of an electrochemical selenoetherification (e&#8208;SE) platform for the efficient site&#8208;selective functionalization of polypeptides. This methodology utilizes the unique reactivity of the 21st amino acid, selenocysteine, to effect formation of valuable bioconjugates through stable selenoether linkages under mild electrochemical conditions. The power of e&#8208;SE is highlighted through late&#8208;stage C&#8208;terminal modification of the FDA&#8208;approved cancer drug leuprolide and assembly of a library of anti&#8208;HER2 affibody conjugates bearing complex cargoes. Following assembly by e&#8208;SE, the utility of functionalized affibodies for in vitro imaging and targeting of HER2 positive breast and lung cancer cell lines is also demonstrated.

         <title>Microwave&#8208;Responsive Flexible Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Materials Based on Poly(vinylidene fluoride) Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A breakthrough in room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emission performance was realized in a poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) matrix with a low glass transition temperature. Polymorph&#8208;dependent RTP emission in the PVDF matrix endows a 2.45&#8197;GHz microwave stimulus responsiveness to the material.







Abstract
The development of flexible, room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials remains challenging owing to the quenching of their unstable triplet excitons via molecular motion. Therefore, a polymer matrix with Tg higher than room temperature is required to prevent polymer segment movement. In this study, a RTP material was developed by incorporating a 4&#8208;biphenylboronic acid (BPBA) phosphor into a poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) matrix (Tg=&#8722;27.1&#8201;&#176;C), which exhibits a remarkable UV&#8208;light&#8208;dependent oxygen consumption phosphorescence with a lifetime of 1275.7&#8197;ms. The adjustable RTP performance is influenced by the crystallinity and polymorph (&#945;, &#946;, and &#947; phases) fraction of PVDF, therefore, the low Tg of the PVDF matrix enables the polymeric segmental motion upon microwave irradiation. Consequently, a reduction in the crystallinity and an increase in the &#945; phase fraction in PVDF film induces RTP after 2.45&#8197;GHz microwave irradiation. These findings open up new avenues for constructing crystalline and phase&#8208;dependent RTP materials while demonstrating a promising approach toward microwave detection.

         <title>Core&#8208;Shell Reactor Partitioning Enzyme and Prodrug by ZIF&#8208;8&#8201;for NADPH&#8208;Sensitive In Situ Prodrug Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel core&#8211;shell reactor partitioning CYP450 and prodrug by ZIF&#8208;8 is proposed to improve the efficacy, selectivity, and safety of enzyme&#8208;prodrug therapy. Here, cytochrome P450 (CYP450) is immobilized in ZIF&#8208;8, and the antitumor drug dacarbazine (DTIC) is coordinated and deposited in its outer layer, leading to a high drug loading capacity of 43.6&#177;0.8&#8201;%. This reactor exhibits NADPH&#8208;sensitive in situ prodrug activation specificity in tumor cells, which achieves high prodrug conversion efficiency of 36.5&#177;1.5&#8201;%.







Abstract
Enzyme&#8208;prodrug therapies have shown unique advantages in efficiency, selectivity, and specificity of in vivo prodrug activation. However, precise spatiotemporal control of both the enzyme and its substrate at the target site, preservation of enzyme activity, and in situ substrate depletion due to low prodrug delivery efficiency continue to be great challenges. Here, we propose a novel core&#8211;shell reactor partitioning enzyme and prodrug by ZIF&#8208;8, which integrates an enzyme with its substrate and increases the drug loading capacity (DLC) using a prodrug as the building ligand to form a Zn&#8208;prodrug shell. Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) is immobilized in ZIF&#8208;8, and the antitumor drug dacarbazine (DTIC) is coordinated and deposited in its outer layer with a high DLC of 43.6&#177;0.8&#8201;%. With this configuration, a much higher prodrug conversion efficiency of CYP450 (36.5&#177;1.5&#8201;%) and lower IC50 value (26.3&#177;2.6&#8197;&#956;g/mL) are measured for B16&#8208;F10 cells with a higher NADPH concentration than those of L02 cells and HUVECs. With the tumor targeting ability of hyaluronic acid, this core&#8211;shell enzyme reactor shows a high tumor suppression rate of 96.6&#177;1.9&#8201;% and provides a simple and versatile strategy for enabling in vivo biocatalysis to be more efficient, selective, and safer.

         <title>Crystallizing Self&#8208;Standing Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Ultrafast Proton Transport in Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;standing COF membrane was prepared for ultrafast proton conduction in flow battery. The &#8722;SO3H groups in macromolecule chains offer sites to interact with the precursors of COF and function as long&#8208;range ordering growing template to enhance the crystallinity of self&#8208;standing COF membrane. Well&#8208;defined channels of COF membranes promised high proton conductivity and excellent battery performance.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) display great potential to be assembled into proton conductive membranes for their uniform and controllable pore structure, yet constructing self&#8208;standing COF membrane with high crystallinity to fully exploit their ordered crystalline channels for efficient ionic conduction remains a great challenge. Here, a macromolecular&#8208;mediated crystallization strategy is designed to manipulate the crystallization of self&#8208;standing COF membrane, where the &#8722;SO3H groups in introduced sulfonated macromolecule chains function as the sites to interact with the precursors of COF and thus offer long&#8208;range ordered template for membrane crystallization. The optimized self&#8208;standing COF membrane composed of highly&#8208;ordered nanopores exhibits high proton conductivity (75&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 100&#8201;% relative humidity and 20&#8201;&#176;C) and excellent flow battery performance, outperforming Nafion 212 and reported membranes. Meanwhile, the long&#8208;term run of membrane is achieved with the help of the anchoring effect of flexible macromolecule chains. Our work provides inspiration to design self&#8208;standing COF membranes with ordered channels for permselective application.

         <title>Photoenzymatic Enantioselective Synthesis of Oxygen&#8208;Containing Benzo&#8208;Fused Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining photocatalysis and biocatalysis allows for the repurposing of the &#8216;ene&#8217;&#8208;reductase enzyme GluER to achieve the enantioselective synthesis of benzo&#8208;fused heterocycles, and various benzoxepinones, chromanone and indanone were specifically afforded in high yields with good to excellent enantioselectivities after protein engineering of GluER.







Abstract
New&#8208;to&#8208;nature biocatalysis in organic synthesis has recently emerged as a green and powerful strategy for the preparation of valuable chiral products, among which chiral oxygen&#8208;containing benzo&#8208;fused heterocycles are important structural motifs in pharmaceutical industry. However, the asymmetric synthesis of these compounds through radical&#8208;mediated methods is challenging. Herein, a novel asymmetric radical&#8208;mediated photoenzymatic synthesis strategy is developed to realize the efficient enantioselective synthesis of oxygen&#8208;containing benzo&#8208;fused heterocycles through structure&#8208;guided engineering of a flavin&#8208;dependent &#8216;ene&#8217;&#8208;reductase GluER. It shows that variant GluER&#8208;W100H could efficiently produce various benzoxepinones, chromanone and indanone with different benzo&#8208;fused rings in high yields with great stereoselectivities under visible light. Moreover, these results are well supported by mechanistic experiments, revealing that this photoenzymatic process involves electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex formation, single electron transfer and hydrogen atom transfer. Therefore, we provide an alternative green approach for efficient chemoenzymatic synthesis of important chiral skeletons of bioactive pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Dimensional and Optoelectronic Tuning of Lead&#8208;free Perovskite Cs3Bi2I9&#8722;nBrn Single Crystals for Enhanced Hard X&#8208;ray Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon doping bromine into zero&#8208;dimensional Cs3Bi2I9 (space group P63/mmc), the crystal structure transforms into a two&#8208;dimensional layer structure (space group P3&#773;m1) as the bromine content reaches Cs3Bi2I8Br. At this optimized composition the Cs3Bi2I8Br single crystal has an outstanding detection performance in terms of record sensitivity for 100&#8197;keV hard X&#8208;rays, ultralow detection limit, and excellent imaging capability at 75&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Inorganic Bi&#8208;based perovskites have shown great potential in X&#8208;ray detection for their large absorption to X&#8208;rays, diverse low&#8208;dimensional structures, and eco&#8208;friendliness without toxic metals. However, they suffer from poor carrier transport properties compared to Pb&#8208;based perovskites. Here, we propose a mixed&#8208;halogen strategy to tune the structural dimensions and optoelectronic properties of Cs3Bi2I9&#8722;nBrn (0&#8804;n&#8804;9). Ten centimeter&#8208;sized single crystals are successfully grown by the Bridgman technique. Upon doping bromine to zero&#8208;dimensional Cs3Bi2I9, the crystal transforms into a two&#8208;dimensional structure as the bromine content reaches Cs3Bi2I8Br. Correspondingly, the optoelectronic properties are adjusted. Among these crystals, Cs3Bi2I8Br exhibits negligible ion migration, moderate resistivity, and the best carrier transport capability. The sensitivities in 100&#8197;keV hard X&#8208;ray detection are 1.33&#215;104 and 1.74&#215;104&#8197;&#956;C Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at room temperature and 75&#8201;&#176;C, respectively, which are the highest among all reported bismuth perovskites. Moreover, the lowest detection limit of 28.6&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1 and ultralow dark current drift of 9.12&#215;10&#8722;9&#8197;nA&#8201;cm&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;V&#8722;1 are obtained owing to the high ionic activation energy. Our work demonstrates that Br incorporation is an effective strategy to enhance the X&#8208;ray detection performance by tuning the dimensional and optoelectronic properties.

         <title>Unraveling the Solvent Effect on Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase Formation for Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 1,2&#8208;diethoxyethane (DEE) molecule promotes the moderate Na+&#8208;DEE coordination, thus leading to the uniform and inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase, as proved by the cryogenic electron microscopy characterizations. Consequently, the Na metal anode is highly stable in the NaPF6/DEE&#8208;based electrolyte with a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.9&#8201;% and dendrite&#8208;free deposition behavior.







Abstract
Ether&#8208;based electrolytes are considered as an ideal electrolyte system for sodium metal batteries (SMBs) due to their superior compatibility with the sodium metal anode (SMA). However, the selection principle of ether solvents and the impact on solid electrolyte interphase formation are still unclear. Herein, we systematically compare the chain ether&#8208;based electrolyte and understand the relationship between the solvation structure and the interphasial properties. The linear ether solvent molecules with different terminal group lengths demonstrate remarkably distinct solvation effects, thus leading to different electrochemical performance as well as deposition morphologies for SMBs. Computational calculations and comprehensive characterizations indicate that the terminal group length significantly regulates the electrolyte solvation structure and consequently influences the interfacial reaction mechanism of electrolytes on SMA. Cryogenic electron microscopy clearly reveals the difference in solid electrolyte interphase in various ether&#8208;based electrolytes. As a result, the 1,2&#8208;diethoxyethane&#8208;based electrolyte enables a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.9&#8201;%, which also realizes the stable cycling of Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 full cell with a mass loading of &#8776;9&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over 500&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Increasing Chemical Diversity of B2N2 Anthracene Derivatives by Introducing Continuous Multiple Boron&#8208;Nitrogen Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic approach has been developed to introduce multiple main group heteroatoms at the zigzag edge of the anthracene framework. BN annulation has led to a naphthalene derivative with an NBO bond. A subsequent BO annulation has been used to extend the fused aromatic ring to afford an anthracene derivative featuring an NBOB system. Changing the NBOB to an NBNB system has further increased the chemical diversity.







Abstract
Increasing the chemical diversity of organic semiconductors is essential to develop efficient electronic devices. In particular, the replacement of carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8722;C) bonds with isoelectronic boron&#8208;nitrogen (B&#8722;N) bonds allows precise modulation of the electronic properties of semiconductors without significant structural changes. Although some researchers have reported the preparation of B2N2 anthracene derivatives with two B&#8722;N bonds, no compounds with continuous multiple BN units have been prepared yet. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a B2N2 anthracene derivative with a BNBN unit formed by converting the BOBN unit at the zigzag edge. Compared to the all&#8208;carbon analogue 2&#8208;phenylanthracene, BNBN anthracene exhibits significant variations in the C&#8722;C bond length and a larger highest occupied molecular orbital&#8211;lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy gap. The experimentally determined bond lengths and electronic properties of BNBN anthracene are confirmed through theoretical calculations. The BOBN anthracene organic light&#8208;emitting diode, used as a blue host, exhibits a low driving voltage. The findings of this study may facilitate the development of larger acenes with multiple BN units and potential applications in organic electronics.

&lt;p&gt;A synthetic approach has been developed to introduce multiple main group heteroatoms at the zigzag edge of the anthracene framework. BN annulation has led to a naphthalene derivative with an NBO bond. A subsequent BO annulation has been used to extend the fused aromatic ring to afford an anthracene derivative featuring an NBOB system. Changing the NBOB to an NBNB system has further increased the chemical diversity.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synthesis of Closed&#8208;Heterohelicenes Interconvertible between Their Monomeric and Dimeric Forms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidation of closed&#8208;[7]helicenes with [bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo]benzene gave the corresponding dimers connected at the &#946;&#8208;positions of the pyrrole units through a remarkably elongated C&#8722;C bond of about 1.60&#8197;&#197;. Homolytic bond dissociation took place upon UV irradiation to reform its monomeric form. The interconversion between monomeric and dimeric forms is associated with a turn&#8208;on of circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
Oxidative fusion reaction of cyclic heteroaromatic pentads consisting of pyrrole and thiophene gave closed&#8208;heterohelicene monomers and dimers depending on the oxidation conditions. Specifically, oxidation with [bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo]benzene (PIFA) gave closed&#8208;[7]helicene dimers connected at the &#946;&#8208;position of one of the pyrrole units with remarkably elongated C&#8722;C bonds of about 1.60&#8197;&#197;. Although this bond was intact against thermal and physical activations, homolytic bond dissociation took place in DMSO upon irradiation with UV light to give the corresponding monomers. Thus, interconversion between the closed&#8208;helicene monomer and dimer was achieved. The optically pure dimer was photo&#8208;dissociated into the monomers associated with a turn&#8208;on of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL).

         <title>Stereospecific Conversion of Boronic Esters into Enones using Methoxyallene: Application in the Total Synthesis of 10&#8208;Deoxymethynolide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot strategy for the stereospecific conversion of boronic esters into enones has been developed using methoxyallene as a commercially available, three&#8208;carbon building block. The methodology is suitable for primary, secondary, and tertiary boronic esters and has been applied to a 14&#8208;step total synthesis of the polyketide 10&#8208;deoxymethynolide.







Abstract
Enones are widely utilized linchpin functional groups in chemical synthesis and molecular biology. We herein report the direct conversion of boronic esters into enones using commercially available methoxyallene as a three&#8208;carbon building block. Following boronate complex formation by reaction of the boronic ester with lithiated&#8208;methoxyallene, protonation triggers a stereospecific 1,2&#8208;migration before oxidation generates the enone. The protocol shows broad substrate scope and complete enantiospecificity is observed with chiral migrating groups. In addition, various electrophiles could be used to induce 1,2&#8208;migration and give a much broader range of &#945;&#8208;functionalized enones. Finally, the methodology was applied to a 14&#8208;step synthesis of the enone&#8208;containing polyketide 10&#8208;deoxymethynolide.

         <title>Tweaking Photo CO2 Reduction by Altering Lewis Acidic Sites in Metalated&#8208;Porous Organic Polymer for Adjustable H2/CO Ratio in Syngas Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn and Co based POP with different Lewis acidity has been developed for controlling water splitting and CO2 reduction under sunlight. Low&#8208;cost option of syngas production with adjustable H2/CO ratio was demonstrated obtained by skipping the use of any sacrificial electron donors (SEDs), cocatalysts, or photo&#8208;sensitizers.







Abstract
Herein, we have specifically designed two metalated porous organic polymers (Zn&#8208;POP and Co&#8208;POP) for syngas (CO+H2) production from gaseous CO2. The variable H2/CO ratio of syngas with the highest efficiency was produced in water medium (without an organic hole scavenger and photosensitizer) by utilizing the basic principle of Lewis acid/base chemistry. Also, we observed the formation of entirely different major products during photocatalytic CO2 reduction and water splitting with the help of the two catalysts, where CO (145.65&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and H2 (434.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) production were preferentially obtained over Co&#8208;POP &amp; Zn&#8208;POP, respectively. The higher electron density/better Lewis basic nature of Co&#8208;POP was investigated further using XPS, XANES, and NH3&#8208;TPD studies, which considerably improve CO2 activation capacity. Moreover, the structure&#8211;activity relationship was confirmed via in situ DRIFTS and DFT studies, which demonstrated the formation of COOH* intermediate along with the thermodynamic feasibility of CO2 reduction over Co&#8208;POP while water splitting occurred preferentially over Zn&#8208;POP.

         <dc:description>Developing novel synthesis technologies is crucial to expanding bifunctional electrocatalysts for energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production. Herein, we report an ambient and controllable &#947;&#8208;ray radiation reduction to synthesize a series of noble metal nanoparticles anchored on defect&#8208;rich manganese oxides (M@MnO2&#8208;x, M = Ru, Pt, Pd, Ir) for glycerol&#8208;assisted H2 evolution. Benefiting from the strong penetrability of &#947;&#8208;rays, nanoparticles and defect supports are formed simultaneously and bridged by metal&#8208;oxygen bonds, guaranteeing structural stability and active site exposure. The special Ru&#8208;O&#8208;Mn bonds activate the Ru and Mn sites in Ru@MnO2&#8208;x through strong interfacial coordination, driving glycerol electrolysis at low overpotential. Furthermore, only a low cell voltage of 1.68 V is required to achieve 0.5 A cm&#8208;2 in a continuous&#8208;flow electrolyzer system along with excellent stability. In situ spectroscopic analysis reveals that the strong interfacial coordination in Ru@MnO2&#8208;x balances the competitive adsorption of glycerol and OH* on the catalyst surface. Theoretical calculations further demonstrate that the defect&#8208;rich MnO2 support promotes the dissociation of H2O, while the defect&#8208;regulated Ru sites promote deprotonation and hydrogen desorption, synergistically enhancing glycerol&#8208;assisted hydrogen production.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Featuring an extra electron in the &#960;* antibonding orbital, species with a 2&#8208;center&#8208;3&#8208;electron (2c3e) &#960; bond without an underlying &#963; bond are scarcely known. Herein, we report the synthesis, isolation and characterization of a radical anion salt [K(18&#8208;C&#8208;6)]+[[(HCNDipp)2Si]2P2]&#8226;&#8722; ([K(18&#8208;C&#8208;6)]+3&#8226;&#8722;) (Dipp = 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl), in which 3&#8226;&#8722; features a perfectly planar Si2P2 four&#8208;membered ring. This species represents the first example of a Si&#8208; and P&#8208;containing analog of a bicyclo[1.1.0]butane radical anion. The unusual bonding motif of 3&#8226;&#8722; was thoroughly investigated via X&#8208;ray crystallography, EPR spectroscopy, and DFT calculations, which unveiled the existence of a 2c3e &#960; bond between the bridgehead P atoms and no clearly defined supporting P&#8210;P &#963; bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Atom Substitution to Obtain Efficient, Lead&#8208;Free Photocatalytic Perovskites Assisted by Machine Learning and DFT Calculations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inorganic lead&#8208;free halide perovskites, devoid of toxic or rare elements, have garnered considerable attention as photocatalysts for pollution control, CO2 reduction and hydrogen production. Exploring the extensive perovskite design space and considering factors like substitution or doping level profoundly impacts their performance. To address this complexity, a synergistic combination of machine learning models and theoretical calculations were used to efficiently screen substitution elements that enhanced the photoactivity of substituted Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskites. Machine learning models determined the importance of d10 orbitals, highlighting how substituent electron configuration affects electronic structure of Cs2AgBiBr6. Conspicuously, d10&#8208;configured Zn2+ boosted the photoactivity of Cs2AgBiBr6. Experimental verification validated these model results, revealing a 13&#8208;fold increase in photocatalytic toluene conversion compared to the unsubstituted counterpart. This enhancement resulted from the small charge carrier effective mass, as well as the creation of shallow trap states, shifting the conduction band minimum, introducing electron&#8208;deficient Br, and altering the distance between the B&#8208;site cations d band centre and the halide anions p band centre, a parameter tuneable through d10 configuration substituents. This study exemplifies the application of computational modelling in photocatalyst design and elucidating structure&#8208;property relationships. It underscores the potential of synergistic integration of calculations, modelling, and experimental analysis across various applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution through Local Field Distortion in Mg/Fe Dual&#8208;site Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal single atom electrocatalysts (SACs) with metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (M&#8208;N&#8208;C) configuration show great potential in oxygen evolution reaction (OER), whereby the spin&#8208;dependent electrons must be allowed to transfer along reactants (OH&#8208;/H2O, singlet spin state) and products (O2, triplet spin state). Therefore, it is imperative to modulate the spin configuration in M&#8211;N&#8211;C to enhance the spin&#8208;sensitive OER energetics, which however remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report a local field distortion induced intermediate to low spin transition by introducing a main&#8208;group element (Mg) into the Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C architecture, and decode the underlying origin of the enhanced OER activity. We unveil that, the large ionic radii mismatch between Mg2+ and Fe2+ can cause a FeN4 in&#8208;plane square local field deformation, which triggers a favorable spin transition of Fe2+ from intermediate (dxy2dxz2dyz1dz21&#65292;2.96 &#956;B) to low spin (dxy2dxz2dyz2, 0.95 &#956;B), and consequently regulate the thermodyna&#8208;mics of the elementary step with desired Gibbs free energies. The as&#8208;obtained Mg/Fe dual&#8208;site catalyst demonstrates a superior OER activity with an overpotential of 224 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 and an electrolysis voltage of only 1.542 V at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 in the overall water splitting, which outperforms those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art transition metal SACs.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of a Potent PROTAC Enables Targeting of FKBP51&#8217;s Scaffolding Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The FK506&#8208;binding protein 51 (FKBP51) is a promising target in a variety of disorders including depression, chronic pain, and obesity. Previous FKBP51&#8208;targeting strategies were restricted to occupation of the FK506&#8208;binding site, which does not affect core functions of FKBP51. Here, we report the discovery of the first FKBP51 Proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) that enables degradation of FKBP51 abolishing FKBP51&#8217;s scaffolding function. Initial synthesis of 220 FKBP&#8208;focused PROTACs yielded a plethora of active PROTACs for FKBP12, six for FKBP51, and none for FKBP52. Structural analysis of a binary FKBP12:PROTAC complex revealed the molecular basis for negative cooperativity. Linker&#8208;based optimization of first generation FKBP51 PROTACs led to the PROTAC SelDeg51 with improved cellular activity, selectivity, and high cooperativity. The structure of the ternary FKBP51:SelDeg51:VCB complex revealed how SelDeg51 establishes cooperativity by dimerizing FKBP51 and VHL in a glue&#8208;like fashion. SelDeg51 efficiently depletes FKBP51 and reactivates GR&#8208;signalling in reporter gene assays, highlighting the enhanced efficacy of full protein degradation compared to classical FKBP51 binding.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Gold Nanorods with Five&#8208;Fold Rotational Symmetry and Orientation&#8208;Dependent Chiroptical Properties of Their Monomers and Dimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral plasmonic nanoparticles have attracted much attention because of their strong chiroptical responses and broad scientific applications. However, the types of chiral plasmonic nanoparticles have remained limited. Herein we report on a new type of chiral nanoparticle, chiral Au nanorod (NR) with five&#8208;fold rotational symmetry, which is synthesized using chiral molecules. Three different types of Au seeds (Au elongated nanodecahedrons, nanodecahedrons, and nanobipyramids) are used to study the growth behaviors. Different synthesis parameters, including the chiral molecules, surfactant, reductant, seeds, and Au precursor, are systematically varied to optimize the chiroptical responses of the chiral Au NRs. The chiral scattering measurements on the individual chiral Au NRs and their dimers are performed. Intriguingly, the chiroptical signals of the individual chiral Au NRs and their end&#8208;to&#8208;end dimers are similar, while those of the side&#8208;by&#8208;side dimers are largely reduced. Theoretical calculations and numerical simulations reveal that the different chiroptical responses of the chiral NR dimers are originated from the coupling effect between the plasmon resonance modes. Our study enriches chiral plasmonic nanoparticles and provides valuable insight for the design of plasmonic nanostructures with desired chiroptical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystallization Regulation by Self&#8208;Assembling Liquid Crystal Template Enables Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is found that the disordered growth&#160;of&#160;bottom&#160;perovskite film deteriorates the buried interface&#160;of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), so developing a new material&#160;to modify the buried interface for regulating&#160;the crystal growth and defect passivation is&#160;an effective approach for improving the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. Here,&#160;we developed a new ionic liquid crystal (ILC, 1&#8208;Dodecyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate) as both crystal regulator and defect passivator to modify the buried interface&#160;of PSCs. The high lattice matching between this ILC and perovskite promotes&#160;preferential growth of perovskite film along [001] direction,&#160;while the oriented&#160;ILC with mesomorphic phase&#160;has a strong chemical interaction with perovskite to passivate the interface defect,&#160;as a result, the modified&#160;buried interface exhibits suppressed defects, improved band alignment, reduced nonradiative recombination losses, and enhanced charge extraction. The ILC&#8208;modified&#160;PSC delivers a power conversion&#160;efficiency of 24.92%&#160;and&#160;maintains&#160;94% of the original value after storage in ambient&#160;for 3000&#8201;h.</dc:description>

         <title>Directional Defect Management in Perovskites by In Situ Decom&#8208;position of Organic Metal Chalcogenides for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Directional defects management in polycrystalline perovskite film with inorganic passivator is highly demanded while yet realized for fabricating efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we develop a directional passivation strategy employing a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) material, Cu&#8208;(4&#8208;mercaptophenol) (Cu&#8208;HBT), as a passivator precursor. Cu&#8208;HBT combines the merits of the targeted modification from organic passivator and excellent stability offered by inorganic passivator. Featuring with dense organic functional motifs on its surfaces, Cu&#8208;HBT has the capability to &#8220;find&#8221; and fasten to the Pb defect sites in perovskites through coordination interactions during a spin&#8208;coating process. During subsequent annealing treatment, the organic functional motifs cleave from Cu&#8208;HBT and convert in&#8208;situ into p&#8208;type semiconductors, Cu2S and PbS. The resultant Cu2S and PbS not only serve as stable inorganic passivators on the perovskite surface, significantly enhancing cell stability, but also facilitate efficient charge extraction and transport, resulting in an impressive efficiency of up to 23.5%. This work contributes a new defect management strategy by directionally yielding the stable inorganic passivators for highly efficient and stable PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Complete Glucose Electrooxidation Enabled by Coordinatively Unsaturated Copper Sites in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrocatalytic oxidation of glucose plays a vital role in biomass conversion, renewable energy, and biosensors, but significant challenges remain to achieve high selectivity and high activity simultaneously. In this study, we present a novel approach for achieving complete glucose electrooxidation utilizing Cu&#8208;based metal&#8208;hydroxide&#8208;organic framework (Cu&#8208;MHOF) featuring coordinatively unsaturated Cu active sites. In contrast to traditional Cu(OH)2 catalysts, the Cu&#8208;MHOF exhibits a remarkable 40&#8208;fold increase in electrocatalytic activity for glucose oxidation, enabling exclusive oxidation of glucose into formate and carbonate as the final products. The critical role of open metal sites in enhancing the adsorption affinity of glucose and key intermediates was confirmed by control experiments and DFT simulations. Subsequently, a miniaturized nonenzymatic glucose sensor was developed showing superior performance with a high sensitivity of 214.7 &#181;A mM&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2, a wide detection range from 0.1 &#181;M to 22 mM, and a low detection limit of 0.086 &#181;M. Our work provides a novel molecule&#8208;level strategy for designing catalytically active sites and could inspire the development of novel MOFs for next&#8208;generation electrochemical devices.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;efficiency Electroreduction of O2 into H2O2 over ZnCo Bimetallic Triazole Frameworks Promoted by Ligand Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Co&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as electrocatalysts for two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8208;&#160;ORR) are highly promising for H2O2&#160;production, but suffer from the intrinsic activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off. Herein, we report a ZnCo bimetal&#8208;triazole framework (ZnCo&#8208;MTF) as high&#8208;efficiency 2e&#8208;&#160;ORR electrocatalysts. The experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the coordination between 1,2,3&#8208;triazole and Co increases the antibonding&#8208;orbital occupancy on the Co&#8208;N bond, promoting the activation of Co center. Besides, the adjacent Zn&#8208;Co sites on 1,2,3&#8208;triazole enable an asymmetric "side&#8208;on" adsorption mode of O2, favoring the reduction of O2&#160;molecules and desorption of OOH* intermediate. By virtue of the unique ligand effect, the ZnCo&#8208;MTF exhibits a 2e&#8208;&#160;ORR selectivity of ~100%, onset potential of 0.614 V and H2O2&#160;production rate of 5.55 mol gcat&#8208;1&#160;h&#8208;1, superior to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art zeolite imidazole frameworks.

         <title>Dynamic Oscillation and Motion of Oil&#8208;in&#8208;Water Emulsion Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interplay of interfacial tensions on droplets results in a range of self&#8208;powered motions that mimic those of living systems and serve as a tunable model to understand their complex non&#8208;equilibrium behavior. Spontaneous shape deformations and oscillations are crucial features observed in nature but difficult to incorporate in synthetic artificial systems. Here, we report sessile oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions that exhibit rapid oscillating behavior. The oscillations depend on the nature and concentration of the surfactant, the chemical composition of the oil, and the wettability of the solid substrate. The rapid changes in the contact angle per oscillation are observed using side&#8208;view optical microscopy. We propose that the changes in the interfacial tension of the oil droplets is due to the partitioning of the surfactant into the oil phase and the movement of self&#8208;emulsified oil out of the parent droplets giving rise to the rhythmic variation in droplet contact&#8208;line. The ability to control and understand droplet oscillation can help model similar oscillations in out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium systems in nature and reproduce biomimetic behavior in artificial systems for various applications, such as microfluidic lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip and adaptive materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable Chirality of Self&#8208;Assembled Dipeptide Mediated by Bipyridine Derivative</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular peptide assemblies have been widely used for the development of biomedical, catalytical, and optical materials with chiral nanostructures in view of the intrinsic chirality of peptides. However, the assembly pathway and chiral transformation behavior of various peptides remain largely elusive especially for the transient assemblies under out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium conditions. Herein, N&#8208;fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl&#8208;protected phenylalanine&#8208;tyrosine dipeptide (Fmoc&#8208;FY) was used as a peptide assembly platform which was discovered that the assembly proceeds multistep evolution. The original spheres caused by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) can nucleate and elongate to the formation of right&#8208;handed helices which were metastable and easily converted to micro&#8208;ribbons. Interestingly, bipyridine derivative can be introduced to effectively control the assembly pathway and induce the formation of thermodynamically stable right&#8208;handed or left&#8208;handed helices at different stoichiometric ratios. In addition, the chiral assembly can also be regulated by ultrasound or enzyme catalysis. This minimalistic system not only broaden the nucleation&#8208;elongation mechanisms of protein aggregates but also promotes the controllable design and development of chiral biomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Decomposition of Perfluorocarbons for over 1000 Hours via Active Site Regeneration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ga assists the defluorination of Al&#8722;F over a Ga/&#952;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst. Al&#8722;OH reacts with CF4 to form Al&#8722;F, resulting in fluorine poisoning on the Al active sites. Adsorption of F at the Al active site is strong and limits the regeneration of the Al&#8722;OH site. However, Ga exhibits weaker adsorption of F and the resulting Ga&#8722;F can easily hydrolyze to Ga&#8722;OH, which can assist the defluorination of poisoned Al active sites through a dehydration&#8208;like process.







Abstract
Tetrafluoromethane (CF4), the simplest perfluorocarbon (PFC), has the potential to exacerbate global warming. Catalytic hydrolysis is a viable method to degrade CF4, but fluorine poisoning severely restricts both the catalytic performance and catalyst lifetime. In this study, Ga is introduced to effectively assists the defluorination of poisoned Al active sites, leading to highly efficient CF4 decomposition at 600&#8201;&#176;C with a catalytic lifetime exceeding 1,000&#8197;hours. 27Al and 71Ga magic&#8208;angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MAS NMR) showed that the introduced Ga exists as tetracoordinated Ga sites (GaIV), which readily dissociate water to form Ga&#8722;OH. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and density function theory (DFT) calculations confirmed that Ga&#8722;OH assists the defluorination of poisoned Al active sites via a dehydration&#8208;like process. As a result, the Ga/Al2O3 catalyst achieved 100&#8201;% CF4 decomposition keeping an ultra&#8208;long catalytic lifetime and outperforming reported results. This work proposes a new approach for efficient and long&#8208;term CF4 decomposition by promoting the regeneration of active sites.

Al&#8722;OH reacts with CF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to form Al&#8722;F, resulting in fluorine poisoning on the Al active sites. Adsorption of F at the Al active site is strong and limits the regeneration of the Al&#8722;OH site. However, Ga exhibits weaker adsorption of F and the resulting Ga&#8722;F can easily hydrolyze to Ga&#8722;OH, which can assist the defluorination of poisoned Al active sites through a dehydration-like process.

In this study, Ga is introduced to effectively assists the defluorination of poisoned Al active sites, leading to highly efficient CF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; decomposition at 600&#8201;&#176;C with a catalytic lifetime exceeding 1,000&#8197;hours. &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;Al and &lt;sup&gt;71&lt;/sup&gt;Ga magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MAS NMR) showed that the introduced Ga exists as tetracoordinated Ga sites (Ga&lt;sub&gt;IV&lt;/sub&gt;), which readily dissociate water to form Ga&#8722;OH. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and density function theory (DFT) calculations confirmed that Ga&#8722;OH assists the defluorination of poisoned Al active sites via a dehydration-like process. As a result, the Ga/Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst achieved 100&#8201;% CF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; decomposition keeping an ultra-long catalytic lifetime and outperforming reported results. This work proposes a new approach for efficient and long-term CF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; decomposition by promoting the regeneration of active sites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Counting d&#8208;Orbital Vacancies of Transition&#8208;Metal Catalysts for the Sulfur Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single electronic&#8208;structure descriptor is proposed by linking the d charge for transition metals to the reaction rate for the sulfur reduction reaction (SRR). This descriptor provides guidelines for the design of catalysts for the SRR as well as various processes and has great promise for driving lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries to practical applications.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) would allow the production of renewable high&#8208;capacity rechargeable lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries using sustainable and nontoxic elemental sulfur as a cathode material, but its slow reaction rate causes a serious shuttle effect and dramatically reduces the capacity. We found that a catalyst composed of Pd nanoparticles supported by ordered mesoporous carbon (Pd/OMC) had a high reaction rate in the SRR, and a Li&#8208;S battery assembled with this catalyst had a low shuttle constant of 0.031&#8197;h&#8722;1 and a high&#8208;rate performance with a specific capacity of 1527&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C which is close to the theoretical value. The high activity of Pd/OMC with a d&#8208;orbital vacancy of 0.87&#8197;e was predicted from a volcano relationship between the d charge for the metal and the adsorption activation entropy and reaction rate for the SRR by examining Pd, Au, Pt, Rh, and Ru transition&#8208;metal nanocatalysts. The strategy of using a single electronic structure descriptor to design high&#8208;efficiency SRR catalysts has suggested a way to produce practical Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Tuning Binding Strength of Multiple Intermediates towards Efficient pH&#8208;universal Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution by Mo8O26&#8208;NbNxOy Heterocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Effective and stable Mo8O26&#8208;NbNxOy heterocatalysts are synthesized for pH&#8208;universal electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The O&#8208;exposed Mo8O26 clusters covalently confined on NbNxOy nanodomains provide a distinctive interface configuration and appropriate electronic structure, which regulates the binding strength of multiple intermediates, thereby accelerating the entire HER kinetics.







Abstract
Developing efficient and robust hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts for scalable and sustainable hydrogen production through electrochemical water splitting is strategic and challenging. Herein, heterogeneous Mo8O26&#8208;NbNxOy supported on N&#8208;doped graphene (defined as Mo8O26&#8208;NbNxOy/NG) is synthesized by controllable hydrothermal reaction and nitridation process. The O&#8208;exposed Mo8O26 clusters covalently confined on NbNxOy nanodomains provide a distinctive interface configuration and appropriate electronic structure, where fully exposed multiple active sites give excellent HER performance beyond commercial Pt/C catalyst in pH&#8208;universal electrolytes. Theoretical studies reveal that the Mo8O26&#8208;NbNxOy interface with electronic reconstruction affords near&#8208;optimal hydrogen adsorption energy and enhanced initial H2O adsorption. Furthermore, the terminal O atoms in Mo8O26 clusters cooperate with Nb atoms to promote the initial H2O adsorption, and subsequently reduce the H2O dissociation energy, accelerating the entire HER kinetics.

         <title>Regioselective and Stereospecific &#946;&#8208;Arabinofuranosylation by Boron&#8208;Mediated Aglycon Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A variety of diols, triols, and unprotected sugar acceptors could be used for &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;/l&#8208;arabinofuranosylation in the presence of a boronic acid catalyst under mild conditions with predictable regioselectivity and complete &#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity. This glycosylation method was applied successfully to the synthesis of trisaccharide structures of arabinogalactan fragments.







Abstract
Regio&#8208; and stereoselective formation of the 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;furanosidic linkage has been in great demand for efficient synthesis of biologically active natural glycosides. In this study, we developed a regioselective and &#946;&#8208;stereospecific d&#8208;/l&#8208;arabinofuranosylation promoted by a boronic acid catalyst under mild conditions. The glycosylations proceeded smoothly for a variety of diols, triols, and unprotected sugar acceptors to give the corresponding &#946;&#8208;arabinofuranosides (&#946;&#8208;Arbf) in high yields with complete &#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity and high regioselectivity. The regioselectivity was completely reversed depending on the optical isomerism of the donor used and was predictable a priori using predictive models. Mechanistic studies based on DFT calculations revealed that the present glycosylation occurs through a highly dissociative concerted SNi mechanism. The usefulness of the glycosylation method was demonstrated by the chemical synthesis of trisaccharide structures of arabinogalactan fragments.

         <title>Activatable Type I Photosensitizer with Quenched Photosensitization Pre and Post Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is considered as one of the most momentous strategies to ablate cancer cells. However, the phototoxicity of photosensitizers pre and post PDT, and the tumor hypoxia environment, are the two major problems that limit the application of PDT. In this paper, we report an activatable type&#8197;I photosensitizer TPFN&#8208;AzoCF3, which could respond to cycling normoxia&#8208;hypoxia and undergo redox cycles in a fully reversible manner.







Abstract
The phototoxicity of photosensitizers (PSs) pre and post photodynamic therapy (PDT), and the hypoxic tumor microenvironment are two major problems limiting the application of PDT. While activatable PSs can successfully address the PS phototoxicity pre PDT, and type&#8197;I PS can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) effectively in hypoxic environment, very limited approaches are available for addressing the phototoxicity post PDT. There is virtually no solution available to address all these issues using a single design. Herein, we propose a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept on&#8208;demand switchable photosensitizer with quenched photosensitization pre and post PDT, which could be activated only in tumor hypoxic environment. Particularly, a hypoxia&#8208;normoxia cycling responsive type&#8197;I PS TPFN&#8208;AzoCF3 was designed to demonstrate the concept, which was further formulated into TPFN&#8208;AzoCF3 nanoparticles (NPs) using DSPE&#8208;PEG&#8208;2000 as the encapsulation matrix. The NPs could be activated only in hypoxic tumors to generate type&#8197;I ROS during PDT treatment, but remain non&#8208;toxic in normal tissues, pre or after PDT, thus minimizing side effects and improving the therapeutic effect. With promising results in in vitro and in vivo tumor treatment, this presented strategy will pave the way for the design of more on&#8208;demand switchable photosensitizers with minimized side effects in the future.

With promising results in &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; tumor treatment, this presented strategy will pave the way for the design of more on-demand switchable photosensitizers with minimized side effects in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Role of Polyelectrolyte&#8208;Tethered Benzimidazolium Cation in Promoting CO2/Pure Water Co&#8208;Electrolysis to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through investigating the organic cation effect on CO2 electroreduction, benzimidazolium cation (Beim+) was found to synergistically enhance CO2 to C2+ product (mainly C2H4) conversion over Cu electrode. As a result, the use of Beim+&#8208;containing alkaline ionomer yielded a high C2H4 partial current density of 331&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 from CO2/pure water co&#8208;electrolysis.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), as a promising route to realize negative carbon emissions, is known to be strongly affected by electrolyte cations (i.e., cation effect). In contrast to the widely&#8208;studied alkali cations in liquid electrolytes, the effect of organic cations grafted on alkaline polyelectrolytes (APE) remains unexplored, although APE has already become an essential component of CO2 electrolyzers. Herein, by studying the organic cation effect on CO2RR, we find that benzimidazolium cation (Beim+) significantly outperforms other commonly&#8208;used nitrogenous cations (R4N+) in promoting C2+ (mainly C2H4) production over copper electrode. Cyclic voltammetry and in situ spectroscopy studies reveal that the Beim+ can synergistically boost the CO2 to *CO conversion and reduce the proton supply at the electrocatalytic interface, thus facilitating the *CO dimerization toward C2+ formation. By utilizing the homemade APE ionomer, we further realize efficient C2H4 production at an industrial&#8208;scale current density of 331&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 from CO2/pure water co&#8208;electrolysis, thanks to the dual&#8208;role of Beim+ in synergistic catalysis and ionic conduction. This study provides a new avenue to boost CO2RR through the structural design of polyelectrolytes.

         <title>Boosting CO2 Photoreduction via Regulating Charge Transfer Ability in a One&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;dimensional pyrene&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (1D PyTTA&#8208;COF) have been applied for CO2 photoreduction for the first time. The stabilization of the aromatic backbone by interchain interaction in 1D PyTTA&#8208;COF improved exciton dissociation and attenuated the thermal relaxation processes of excited photoelectrons, aiding the movement of photoelectrons across the imine linkage to catalytic sites for CO2 conversion.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) imine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) hold potential for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. However, high energy barrier of imine linkage impede the in&#8208;plane photoelectron transfer process, resulting in inadequate efficiency of CO2 photoreduction. Herein, we present a dimensionality induced local electronic modulation strategy through the construction of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) pyrene&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (PyTTA&#8208;COF). The dual&#8208;chain&#8208;like edge architectures of 1D PyTTA&#8208;COF enable the stabilization of aromatic backbones, thus reducing energy loss during exciton dissociation and thermal relaxation, which provides energetic photoelectron to traverse the energy barrier of imine linkages. As a result, the 1D PyTTA&#8208;COF exhibits significantly enhanced CO2 photoreduction activity under visible&#8208;light irradiation when coordinated with metal cobalt ion, yielding a remarkable CO evolution of 1003&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 over an 8&#8208;hour period, which surpasses that of the corresponding 2D counterpart by a factor of 59. These findings present a valuable approach to address in&#8208;plane charge transfer limitations in imine&#8208;based COFs.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Depolymerization of Plastic Waste Enabled by Plastic&#8208;Catalyst Interfacial Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An autogenous heterogeneous catalyst layer was discovered on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) surfaces during the generally believed homogeneous catalytic depolymerization process. The construction of plastic&#8208;catalyst solid&#8208;solid interfaces by interfacial engineering approaches enables vapor phase depolymerization of polyethylene terephthalate to dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) at low temperatures with a trace amount of earth abundant metal, Zn.







Abstract
Depolymerization of condensation polymers by chemolysis often suffers from the large usage of solvents and homogeneous catalysts such as acids, bases, and metal salts. The catalytic efficiency of heterogeneous catalysts is largely constrained by the poor interfacial contact between solid catalysts and solid plastics below melting points. We report here our discovery of autogenous heterogeneous catalyst layer on polyethylene terephthalate surfaces during the generally believed homogeneous catalytic depolymerization process. Inspired by the &#8220;contact mass&#8221; concept in industrial chlorosilane production, we further demonstrate that the construction of plastic&#8208;catalyst solid&#8208;solid interfaces enables solvent&#8208;free depolymerization of polyethylene terephthalate by vapor phase methanolysis at relatively low temperatures. Trace amounts of earth&#8208;abundant element (zinc) introduced by electrostatic adsorption is sufficient for catalyzing the depolymerization. The concept of plastic&#8208;catalyst contact mass interfacial catalysis might inspire new pathways for tackling plastic waste problems.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis and Real&#8208;Space Visualization of Aromatic P3N3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structurally elusive cyclotriphosphazene (P3N3, 1), an inorganic aromatic analogue of benzene, has been synthesized by scanning probe manipulation and visually inspected by high&#8208;resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM).







Abstract
On&#8208;surface synthesis is at the verge of emerging as the method of choice for the generation and visualization of unstable or unconventional molecules, which could not be obtained via traditional synthetic methods. A case in point is the on&#8208;surface synthesis of the structurally elusive cyclotriphosphazene (P3N3), an inorganic aromatic analogue of benzene. Here, we report the preparation of this fleetingly existing species on Cu(111) and Au(111) surfaces at 5.2&#8197;K through molecular manipulation with unprecedented precision, i.e., voltage pulse&#8208;induced sextuple dechlorination of an ultra&#8208;small (about 6&#8197;&#197;) hexachlorophosphazene P3N3Cl6 precursor by the tip of a scanning probe microscope. Real&#8208;space atomic&#8208;level imaging of cyclotriphosphazene reveals its planar D3h&#8208;symmetric ring structure. Furthermore, this demasking strategy has been expanded to generate cyclotriphosphazene from a hexaazide precursor P3N21 via a different stimulation method (photolysis) for complementary measurements by matrix isolation infrared and ultraviolet spectroscopy.

A cobalt(I)&#8208;catalyzed regioselective allylic alkylation of tertiary allylic carbonates with 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds is described. The alkylated products are obtained in high yields and with excellent selectivity towards the kinetic branched regioisomer. Mechanistic insights by combining experimental and computational investigations support a Co(I)/Co(III) catalytic cycle.







Abstract
Here, we report the development of cobalt(I)&#8208;catalyzed regioselective allylic alkylation reactions of tertiary allyl carbonates with 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds. A family of well&#8208;defined tetrahedral cobalt(I) complexes bearing commercially available bidentate bis(phosphine) ligands [(P,P)Co(PPh3)Cl] are synthesized and explored as catalysts in allylic alkylation reactions. The catalyst [(dppp)Co(PPh3)Cl] (dppp=1,3&#8208;Bis(diphenylphosphino)propane) enables the alkylation of a large variety of tertiary allyl carbonates with high yields and excellent regioselectivity for the branched product. Remarkably, this methodology is selective for the activation of tertiary allyl carbonates even in the presence of secondary allyl carbonates. This contrasts with the selectivity observed in cobalt&#8208;catalyzed allylic alkylations enabled by visible light photocatalysis. Mechanistic insights by means of experimental and computational investigations support a Co(I)/Co(III) catalytic cycle.

         <title>Spatially Resolved Organic Whispering&#8208;Gallery&#8208;Mode Hetero&#8208;Microrings for High&#8208;Security Photonic Barcodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Whispering&#8208;gallery&#8208;mode (WGM) hetero&#8208;microrings were realized through a surface tension&#8208;assisted heterogeneous self&#8208;assembly strategy via the regulation of charge&#8208;transfer interactions along circular boundaries. This remarkably promotes the security level and encoding capacity of the barcodes. The results may be useful to fabricate organic hierarchical hybrid WGM heterostructures for optical information recording and security labels.







Abstract
Whispering&#8208;gallery&#8208;mode (WGM) microcavities featuring distinguishable sharp peaks in a broadband exhibit enormous advantages in the field of miniaturized photonic barcodes. However, such kind of barcodes developed hitherto are primarily based on microcavities wherein multiple gain medias were blended into a single matrix, thus resulting in the limited and indistinguishable coding elements. Here, a surface tension assisted heterogeneous assembly strategy is proposed to construct the spatially resolved WGM hetero&#8208;microrings with multiple spatial colors along its circular direction. Through precisely regulating the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) strength, full&#8208;color microrings covering the entire visible range were effectively acquired, which exhibit a series of sharp and recognizable peaks and allow for the effective construction of high&#8208;quality photonic barcodes. Notably, the spatially resolved WGM hetero&#8208;microrings with multiple coding elements were finally acquired through heterogeneous nucleation and growth controlled by the directional diffusion between the hetero&#8208;emulsion droplets, thus remarkably promoting the security strength and coding capacity of the barcodes. The results would be useful to fabricate new types of organic hierarchical hybrid WGM heterostructures for optical information recording and security labels.

         <title>A Bidentate Antimony Pnictogen Bonding Host System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bidentate pnictogen&#8208;bonding host system based on Sb(C2F5)2 functions was constructed and its host&#8211;guest chemistry tested towards a variety of substrates including Me2O and its higher homologues, halide ions and N&#8208;heterocyclic bases. The new host system shows cooperativity of the two C&#8801;C&#8722;Sb(C2F5)2 functions during adduct formation. The complexes were analyzed both experimentally (XRD, NMR) and by computational methods (DFT, QTAIM, IQA).







Abstract
A bidentate pnictogen bonding host&#8208;system based on 1,8&#8208;diethynylanthracene was synthesized by a selective tin&#8208;antimony exchange reaction and investigated regarding its ability to act as a Lewis acidic host component for the complexation of Lewis basic or anionic guests. In this work, the novel C&#8801;C&#8722;Sb(C2F5)2 unit was established to study the potential of antimony(III) sites as representatives for the scarcely explored pnictogen bonding donors. The capability of this partly fluorinated host system was investigated towards halide anions (Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, I&#8722;), dimethyl chalcogenides Me2Y (Y=O, S, Se, Te), and nitrogen heterocycles (pyridine, pyrimidine). Insights into the adduct formation behavior as well as the bonding situation of such E&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Sb&#8722;CF moieties were obtained in solution by means of NMR spectroscopy, in the solid state by X&#8208;ray diffraction, by elemental analyses, and by computational methods (DFT, QTAIM, IQA), respectively.

         <title>Hydrodeoxygenation of Oxygen&#8208;Containing Aromatic Plastic Wastes to Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic system comprised of Ru&#8208;ReOx/SiO2 and HZSM&#8208;5 was developed for hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of various oxygen&#8208;containing aromatic plastic wastes (PC, PET, PBT, and PPO) to cycloalkanes as liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs), with high yields up to 99&#8201;% and a theoretical hydrogen storage capacity of ca. 5.74&#8197;wt%.







Abstract
To address the global plastic pollution issues and the challenges of hydrogen storage and transportation, we report a system, based on the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of oxygen&#8208;containing aromatic plastic wastes, from which organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) can be derived. We developed a catalytic system comprised of Ru&#8208;ReOx/SiO2+HZSM&#8208;5 for direct HDO of polycarbonate (PC), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), polyphenylene oxide (PPO), and their mixtures, to cycloalkanes as LOHCs, with high yields up to 99&#8201;%, under mild reaction conditions. The theoretical hydrogen storage capacity reaches ca. 5.74&#8197;wt%. The reaction pathway involves depolymerization of PC into C15 aromatics and C15 monophenols by direct hydrogenolysis of the C&#8722;O bond between the benzene ring and ester group, and subsequent parallel hydrogenation of C15 aromatics and HDO of C15 monophenols. HDO of cyclic alcohol is the rate&#8208;determining step. The active site is Ru metallic nanoparticles with partially covered ReOx species. The excellent performance is attributed to the synergetic effect of oxophilic ReOx species and Ru metallic sites for C&#8722;O hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation, and the promotion effect of HZSM&#8208;5 for dehydration of cyclic alcohol. The highly efficient and stable dehydrogenation of cycloalkanes over Pt/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 confirms that HDO products can act as LOHCs.

Abstract
Removal of trace impurities for natural gas purification coupled with waste gas conversion is highly desired in industry.

         <title>Poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline)&#8208;Ladder&#8208;Type Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Covalent Organic Framework for Fast Proton Storage

A perinone&#8208;based poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline)&#8208;ladder&#8208;type two&#8208;dimensional conjugated covalent organic framework (COF) has been developed for a fast proton storage in both a mild aqueous Zn&#8208;ion electrolyte and strong acid. The largely reduced electron density on the C&#8722;O&#8722; groups after discharge results in the unique proton affinity of the COF electrode and an excellent rate capability of up to 200&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
Electrochemical proton storage plays an essential role in designing next&#8208;generation high&#8208;rate energy storage devices, e.g., aqueous batteries. Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated covalent organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;COFs) are promising electrode materials, but their competitive proton and metal&#8208;ion insertion mechanisms remain elusive, and proton storage in COFs is rarely explored. Here, we report a perinone&#8208;based poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL)&#8208;ladder&#8208;type 2D c&#8208;COF for fast proton storage in both a mild aqueous Zn&#8208;ion electrolyte and strong acid. We unveil that the discharged C&#8722;O&#8722; groups exhibit largely reduced basicity due to the considerable &#960;&#8208;delocalization in perinone, thus affording the 2D c&#8208;COF a unique affinity for protons with fast kinetics. As a consequence, the 2D c&#8208;COF electrode presents an outstanding rate capability of up to 200&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 (over 2500&#8197;C), surpassing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art conjugated polymers, COFs, and metal&#8211;organic frameworks. Our work reports the first example of pure proton storage among COFs and highlights the great potential of BBL&#8208;ladder&#8208;type 2D conjugated polymers in future energy devices.

         <title>Iodotrimethylsilane as a Reactive Ligand for Surface Etching and Passivation of Perovskite Nanocrystals toward Efficient Pure&#8208;red to Deep&#8208;red LEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;phase ligand exchange strategy is used to resurface perovskite nanocrystal surfaces with a chemically active, short and conductive ligand, Iodotrimethylsilane (TMIS), which also functions as a surface passivant. Excellent conductivity and photostability allowed us to fabricate compact, high&#8208;mobility and trap&#8208;free perovskite NC films with high PLQY (&gt;90%). As a result, we achieve CsPbI3 NC&#8208;based PeLEDs with an EQE of ~23%.







Abstract
Resurfacing perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) with tight&#8208;binding and conductive ligands to resolve the dynamic ligands&#8212;surface interaction is the fundamental issue for their applications in perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs). Although various types of surface ligands have been proposed, these ligands either exhibit weak Lewis acid/base interactions or need high polar solvents for dissolution and passivation, resulting in a compromise in the efficiency and stability of PeLEDs. Herein, we report a chemically reactive agent (Iodotrimethylsilane, TMIS) to address the trade&#8208;off among conductivity, solubility and passivation using all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3 NCs. The liquid TMIS ensures good solubility in non&#8208;polar solvents and reacts with oleate ligands and produces in situ HI for surface etching and passivation, enabling strong&#8208;binding ligands on the NCs surface. We report, as a result, red PeLEDs with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of &#8776;23&#8201;%, which is 11.2&#8208;fold higher than the control, and is among the highest CsPbI3 PeLEDs. We further demonstrate the universality of this ligand strategy in the pure bromide system (CsPbBr3), and report EQE of &#8776;20&#8201;% at 640, 652, and 664&#8197;nm. This represents the first demonstration of a chemically reactive ligand strategy that applies to different systems and works effectively in red PeLEDs spanning emission from pure&#8208;red to deep&#8208;red.

         <title>Concentrated Ionic Fluids: Is There a Difference Between Chloride&#8208;Based Brines and Deep Eutectic Solvents?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conductivity, viscosity, water, and chloride content were measured for brines and aqueous DESs. Low viscosity brines favour copper etching due to higher mass transport. Low water content DESs promote etching for silver and nickel.







Abstract
Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) have been lauded as novel solvents, but is there really a difference between them and concentrated aqueous brines? They provide a method of adjusting the activity of water and chloride ions which can affect mass transport, speciation and reactivity. This study proposes a continuum of properties across concentrated ionic fluids and uses metal processing as an example. Charge transport is shown to be governed by fluidity and there is no discontinuity between molar conductivity and fluidity irrespective of cation, charge density or ionic radius. Diffusion coefficients of iron(III) and copper(II) chloride in numerous concentrated ionic fluids show the same linear correlation between diffusion coefficient and fluidity. These oxidising agents were used to etch copper, silver and nickel and while the etching rate increased with fluidity for copper, etching of silver and nickel only occurred at high chloride and low water activity as passivation occurred when water activity increased. Overall, brines provide a high chloride content at a lower viscosity than DESs, but unlike DESs, brines are unable to prevent passivation due to their high water content. The results show how selective etching of mixed metal waste streams can be achieved by tuning chloride and water activity.

         <title>Insertion of (Bioactive) Equatorial Ligands into Platinum(IV) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We investigated the incorporation of equatorial ligands into platinum(IV) complexes, enabling the synthesis of otherwise unavailable complexes. Attachment of albumin&#8208;targeting maleimide moieties led to increased tumor accumulation and anticancer activity compared to oxaliplatin. The presented strategy will allow the development of new types of targeted multi&#8208;action platinum(IV) complexes.







Abstract
Platinum(IV) prodrugs are highly interesting alternatives to platinum(II) anticancer therapeutics due to their increased tumor selectivity and reduced side effects. In contrast to the established theory, we recently observed that the equatorial ligand(s) of e.g. oxaliplatin(IV) complexes can be hydrolyzed with formation of [(DACH)Pt(OHeq)2(OAcax)2]. In the work presented here, we investigated the reactivity and synthetic usability of this complex to be exploited as a precursor for the development of novel platinum(IV) complexes, not able to be synthesized by conventional protocols. Indeed, we could substitute the equatorial hydroxido ligand(s) e.g. by one or two monodentate biotin ligands (which would be oxidized under standard methods). The formed complexes turned out to be very stable with slow ligand release after reduction, ideal for long&#8208;circulating tumor&#8208;targeting strategies. Therefore, two platinum(IV) complexes with equatorial maleimides, capable of exploiting serum albumin as a natural nanocarrier, were synthesized as well.

     alt="Insertion of (Bioactive) Equatorial Ligands into Platinum(IV) Complexes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigated the incorporation of equatorial ligands into platinum(IV) complexes, enabling the synthesis of otherwise unavailable complexes. Attachment of albumin-targeting maleimide moieties led to increased tumor accumulation and anticancer activity compared to oxaliplatin. The presented strategy will allow the development of new types of targeted multi-action platinum(IV) complexes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platinum(IV) prodrugs are highly interesting alternatives to platinum(II) anticancer therapeutics due to their increased tumor selectivity and reduced side effects. In contrast to the established theory, we recently observed that the equatorial ligand(s) of e.g. oxaliplatin(IV) complexes can be hydrolyzed with formation of [(DACH)Pt(OH&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OAc&lt;sub&gt;ax&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]. In the work presented here, we investigated the reactivity and synthetic usability of this complex to be exploited as a precursor for the development of novel platinum(IV) complexes, not able to be synthesized by conventional protocols. Indeed, we could substitute the equatorial hydroxido ligand(s) e.g. by one or two monodentate biotin ligands (which would be oxidized under standard methods). The formed complexes turned out to be very stable with slow ligand release after reduction, ideal for long-circulating tumor-targeting strategies. Therefore, two platinum(IV) complexes with equatorial maleimides, capable of exploiting serum albumin as a natural nanocarrier, were synthesized as well. The complexes showed massively prolonged plasma half-life and distinctly improved anticancer activity in vivo compared to oxaliplatin. Taken together, the newly developed synthetic platform allows the simple and specific insertion of equatorial ligands into platinum(IV) complexes. This will enable the attachment of three different (bioactive) moieties generating targeted triple-action platinum(IV) prodrugs within one single platinum complex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bacterial Cytochrome P450 Catalyzed Post&#8208;translational Macrocyclization of Ribosomal Peptides
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
P450 enzymes are highly effective catalysts, yet little research has been conducted on their ability to modify ribosomal peptides. Now uncharted bacterial cytochrome P450s responsible for the macrocyclization of ribosomal peptides have been discovered by sequence&#8208; and 3D&#8208;structure&#8208;based genome mining. These P450s exhibit diverse catalytic capabilities, catalyzing aromatic crosslinking by forming C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, and C&#8722;O bonds.







Abstract
Ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are a fascinating group of natural products that exhibit diverse structural features and bioactivities. P450&#8208;catalyzed RiPPs stand out as a unique but underexplored family. Herein, we introduce a rule&#8208;based genome mining strategy that harnesses the intrinsic biosynthetic principles of RiPPs, including the co&#8208;occurrence and co&#8208;conservation of precursors and P450s and interactions between them, successfully facilitating the identification of diverse P450&#8208;catalyzed RiPPs. Intensive BGC characterization revealed four new P450s, KstB, ScnB, MciB, and SgrB, that can catalyze the formation of Trp&#8208;Trp&#8208;Tyr (one C&#8722;C and two C&#8722;N bonds), Tyr&#8208;Trp (C&#8722;C bond), Trp&#8208;Trp (C&#8722;N bond), and His&#8208;His (ether bond) crosslinks, respectively, within three or four residues. KstB, ScnB, and MciB could accept non&#8208;native precursors, suggesting they could be promising starting templates for bioengineering to construct macrocycles. Our study highlights the potential of P450s to expand the chemical diversity of strained macrocyclic peptides and the range of biocatalytic tools available for peptide macrocyclization.

         <title>Correlation of Broad Absorption Band with Small Singlet&#8208;Triplet Energy Gap in Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>

Three new non&#8208;fullerene acceptors were developed by tailoring the side&#8208;group conjugation length. They show simultaneously broadened short&#8208;wavelength absorption band and reduced singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap. The relevant solar cells deliver a high efficiency of 18.5&#8201;% as processed by non&#8208;halogenated solvent, among the highest value for solar cells processed by green solvent and based on new acceptor structures.







Abstract
Organic photovoltaics (OPV) are one of the most effective ways to harvest renewable solar energy, with the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices soaring above 19&#8201;% when processed with halogenated solvents. The superior photocurrent of OPV over other emerging photovoltaics offers more opportunities to further improve the efficiency. Tailoring the absorption band of photoactive materials is an effective way to further enhance OPV photocurrent. However, the field has mostly been focusing on improving the near&#8208;infrared region photo&#8208;response, with the absorption shoulders in short&#8208;wavelength region (SWR) usually being neglected. Herein, by developing a series of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) with varied side&#8208;group conjugations, we observe an enhanced SWR absorption band with increased side&#8208;group conjugation length. The underpinning factors of how molecular structures and geometries improve SWR absorption are clearly elucidated through theoretical modelling and crystallography. Moreover, a clear relationship between the enhanced SWR absorption and reduced singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap is established, both of which are favorable for the OPV performance and can be tailored by rational structure design of NFAs. Finally, the rationally designed NFA, BO&#8208;TTBr, affords a decent PCE of 18.5&#8201;% when processed with a non&#8208;halogenated green solvent.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation Activity&#8208;Stability Maps for Perovskite Oxides Containing 3d, 4d and 5d Transition Metals</title>

         <dc:description>
Activity&#8208;stability maps toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are experimentally created for a family of 66&#8197;SrTixRuyIrzO3 perovskite oxides. The effects of hybridization of mixed transition metal 3d&#8208;4d&#8208;5d and oxygen 2p orbitals on catalytic activity, stability and mechanism are discussed.







Abstract
Improving catalytic activity without loss of catalytic stability is one of the core goals in search of low&#8208;iridium&#8208;content oxygen evolution electrocatalysts under acidic conditions. Here, we synthesize a family of 66&#8197;SrBO3 perovskite oxides (B=Ti, Ru, Ir) with different Ti&#8201;:&#8201;Ru&#8201;:&#8201;Ir atomic ratios and construct catalytic activity&#8208;stability maps over composition variation. The maps classify the multicomponent perovskites into chemical groups with distinct catalytic activity and stability for acidic oxygen evolution reaction, and highlights a chemical region where high catalytic activity and stability are achieved simultaneously at a relatively low iridium level. By quantifying the extent of hybridization of mixed transition metal 3d&#8208;4d&#8208;5d and oxygen 2p orbitals for multicomponent perovskites, we demonstrate this complex interplay between 3d&#8208;4d&#8208;5d metals and oxygen atoms in governing the trends in both activity and stability as well as in determining the catalytic mechanism involving lattice oxygen or not.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Alkaline Seawater Electrolysis with Anomalous Chloride Promoted Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anomalous Cl&#8722;&#8208;promoted oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanism with a typical catalyst, nickel&#8208;iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe&#8208;LDH), is proposed. First, both Fe leaching and active lattice oxygen are suppressed by the adsorption of Cl&#8722; on desired Fe sites, which improves the catalyst's long&#8208;term stability. Second, more high&#8208;valency OER&#8208;active Ni sites are created, thus increasing the activity.







Abstract
A highly selective and durable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst is the bottleneck for direct seawater splitting because of side reactions primarily caused by chloride ions (Cl&#8722;). Most studies about OER catalysts in seawater focus on the repulsion of the Cl&#8722; to reduce its negative effects. Herein, we demonstrate that the absorption of Cl&#8722; on the specific site of a popular OER electrocatalyst, nickel&#8208;iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH), does not have a significant negative impact; rather, it is beneficial for its activity and stability enhancement in natural seawater. A set of in situ characterization techniques reveals that the adsorption of Cl&#8722; on the desired Fe site suppresses Fe leaching, and creates more OER&#8208;active Ni sites, improving the catalyst's long&#8208;term stability and activity simultaneously. Therefore, we achieve direct alkaline seawater electrolysis for the very first time on a commercial&#8208;scale alkaline electrolyser (AE, 120&#8197;cm2 electrode area) using the NiFe LDH anode. The new alkaline seawater electrolyser exhibits a reduction in electricity consumption by 20.7&#8201;% compared to the alkaline purified water&#8208;based AE using commercial Ni catalyst, achieving excellent durability for 100&#8197;h at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

Most studies about OER catalysts in seawater focus on the repulsion of the Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to reduce its negative effects. Herein, we demonstrate that the absorption of Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; on the specific site of a popular OER electrocatalyst, nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH), does not have a significant negative impact; rather, it is beneficial for its activity and stability enhancement in natural seawater. A set of in situ characterization techniques reveals that the adsorption of Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; on the desired Fe site suppresses Fe leaching, and creates more OER-active Ni sites, improving the catalyst's long-term stability and activity simultaneously. Therefore, we achieve direct alkaline seawater electrolysis for the very first time on a commercial-scale alkaline electrolyser (AE, 120&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; electrode area) using the NiFe LDH anode. The new alkaline seawater electrolyser exhibits a reduction in electricity consumption by 20.7&#8201;% compared to the alkaline purified water-based AE using commercial Ni catalyst, achieving excellent durability for 100&#8197;h at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A DNA Origami&#8208;based Bactericide for Efficient Healing of Infected Wounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA origami&#8208;based bactericide with precisely organized bacterial membrane breaker (DNAzymes, G4/hemin) and abundantly loaded broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotic (levofloxacin) was constructed for the efficient healing of infected wounds under the guidance of DNA aptamer targeting bacterial peptidoglycan.







Abstract
Bacteria infection is a significant obstacle in the clinical treatment of exposed wounds facing widespread pathogens. Herein, we report a DNA origami&#8208;based bactericide for efficient anti&#8208;infection therapy of infected wounds in vivo. In our design, abundant DNAzymes (G4/hemin) can be precisely organized on the DNA origami for controllable generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to break bacterial membranes. After the destruction of the membrane, broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotic levofloxacin (LEV, loaded in the DNA origami through interaction with DNA duplex) can be easily delivered into the bacteria for successful sterilization. With the incorporation of DNA aptamer targeting bacterial peptidoglycan, the DNA origami&#8208;based bactericide can achieve targeted and combined antibacterial therapy for efficiently promoting the healing of infected wounds. This tailored DNA origami&#8208;based nanoplatform provides a new strategy for the treatment of infectious diseases in vivo.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Based Electron Buffer Layer on ZnOx&#8722;Fe5C2&#8722;Fe3O4 Boosts Ethanol Synthesis from CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbon&#8208;based electron buffer layer was employed to neutralize the excessive electrons transferred from ZnOx to Fe species. A suitable CO adsorption strength and C&#8722;C coupling barrier was achieved as a consequence of the Fe&#8208;based active sites, yielding a high ethanol yield of 366.6&#8197;gEtOH&#8201;kgcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 from CO2+H2. The result differs from the common ZnFe bimetallic catalyst for which hydrocarbons dominate.







Abstract
The conversion of CO2 into ethanol with renewable H2 has attracted tremendous attention due to its integrated functions of carbon elimination and chemical synthesis, but remains challenging. The electronic properties of a catalyst are essential to determine the adsorption strength and configuration of the key intermediates, therefore altering the reaction network for targeted synthesis. Herein, we describe a catalytic system in which a carbon buffer layer is employed to tailor the electronic properties of the ternary ZnOx&#8722;Fe5C2&#8722;Fe3O4, in which the electron&#8208;transfer pathway (ZnOx&#8594;Fe species or carbon layer) ensures the appropriate adsorption strength of &#8722;CO* on the catalytic interface, facilitating C&#8722;C coupling between &#8722;CHx* and &#8722;CO* for ethanol synthesis. Benefiting from this unique electron&#8208;transfer buffering effect, an extremely high ethanol yield of 366.6&#8197;gEtOH&#8201;kgcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 (with CO of 10&#8197;vol&#8201;% co&#8208;feeding) is achieved from CO2 hydrogenation. This work provides a powerful electronic modulation strategy for catalyst design in terms of highly oriented synthesis.

         <title>Chiral Deep Eutectic Solvents Enable Full&#8208;Color and White Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Achiral Luminophores</title>

The solvation of an achiral fluorescent dye in a chiral deep eutectic solvent enables the generation of full&#8208;color circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
Herein, chiral deep eutectic solvents (DES) are prepared by lauric acid as hydrogen bond donors (HBD) and chiral menthol as hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA). When achiral fluorescent molecules are dopedin the menthol&#8208;based chiral DES, they emit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with handedness controlled by the molecular chirality (l or d) of menthol. Remarkably, the strategy is universal and a series of achiral fluorescent molecules can be endowed with CPL activity, showing a full&#8208;color and white CPL upon appropriate mixing, which paves the way to prepare white CPL materials. Interestingly, CPL appears only in a certain temperature range in the DES. Variable&#8208;temperature spectra and other characterization methods reveal that the H&#8208;bond network in the chiral DES plays an important role in inducing CPL. This work unveils how the interior structure as well as the hydrogen&#8208;bond network of a chiral DES can transfer its chirality to achiral luminophores for the first time and realizes a full&#8208;color and white CPL in a DES.

N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs) monolayers have been self&#8208;assembled on Au(111) and characterized with high thermal stability and a large impact on work&#8208;function values, demonstrating the crucial influence of the carbon&#8208;metal &#963;&#8208;bond on monolayer properties







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) of N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs) have been prepared on Au(111) and their thermal stability, adsorption geometry, and molecular order were characterized by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, polarized X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The strong &#963;&#8208;bond character of NHO anchoring to Au induced high geometrical flexibility that enabled a flat&#8208;lying adsorption geometry via coordination to a gold adatom. The flat&#8208;lying adsorption geometry was utilized to further increase the surface interaction of the NHO monolayer by backbone functionalization with methyl groups that induced high thermal stability and a large impact on work&#8208;function values, which outperformed that of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes. STM measurements, supported by DFT modeling, identified that the NHOs were self&#8208;assembled in dimers, trimers, and tetramers constructed of two, three, and four complexes of NHO&#8722;Au&#8208;adatom. This self&#8208;assembly pattern was correlated to strong NHO&#8722;Au interactions and steric hindrance between adsorbates, demonstrating the crucial influence of the carbon&#8208;metal &#963;&#8208;bond on monolayer properties.

         <title>Manipulating Lone&#8208;Pair&#8208;Driven Luminescence in 0D Tin Halides by Pressure&#8208;Tuned Stereochemical Activity from Static to Dynamic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pressure&#8208;driven stereochemical activity transformation of the lone pair from static to dynamic was achieved in 0D 5&#8197;s2 metal halides, corresponding to the self&#8208;trapped exciton emission switching from a red broadband triplet emission to a sky&#8208;blue narrowband singlet emission.







Abstract
The excellent luminescence properties and structural dynamics driven by the stereoactivity of the lone pair in a variety of low&#8208;dimensional ns2 metal halides have attracted growing investigations for optoelectronic applications. However, the structural and photophysical aspects of the excited state associated with the lone pair expression are currently open questions. Herein, zero&#8208;dimensional Sn&#8208;based halides with static stereoactive 5&#8197;s2 lone pairs are selected as a model system to understand the correlations between the distinctive lone pair expression and the excited&#8208;state structural relaxation and charge carrier dynamics by continuous lattice manipulation. Lattice compression drives 5&#8197;s2 lone pair active switching and self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) redistribution by suppressing excited&#8208;state structural deformation of the isolated SnBr42&#8722; units. Our results demonstrate that the static expression of the 5&#8197;s2 lone pair results in a red broadband triplet STE emission with a large Stokes shift, while its dynamic expression creates a sky&#8208;blue narrowband emission dominated by the radiative recombination of singlet STEs. Our findings and the photophysical mechanism proposed highlight the stereochemical effects of lone pair expression in controlling light emission properties and offer constructive guidelines for tuning the optoelectronic properties in diverse ns2 metal halides.

         <title>A GPT&#8208;4 Reticular Chemist for Guiding MOF Discovery
</title>

         <dc:description>
The power of using artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;human collaboration to advance reticular chemistry is shown. Through iterative learning, the GPT&#8208;4 Reticular Chemist indicates instructions while evolving based on the feedback from a human researcher. It results in the innovative discovery of a series of isoreticular metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), and suggests an approach for using large language models in experimental scientific research.







Abstract
We present a new framework integrating the AI model GPT&#8208;4 into the iterative process of reticular chemistry experimentation, leveraging a cooperative workflow of interaction between AI and a human researcher. This GPT&#8208;4 Reticular Chemist is an integrated system composed of three phases. Each of these utilizes GPT&#8208;4 in various capacities, wherein GPT&#8208;4 provides detailed instructions for chemical experimentation and the human provides feedback on the experimental outcomes, including both success and failures, for the in&#8208;context learning of AI in the next iteration. This iterative human&#8208;AI interaction enabled GPT&#8208;4 to learn from the outcomes, much like an experienced chemist, by a prompt&#8208;learning strategy. Importantly, the system is based on natural language for both development and operation, eliminating the need for coding skills, and thus, make it accessible to all chemists. Our collaboration with GPT&#8208;4 Reticular Chemist guided the discovery of an isoreticular series of MOFs, with each synthesis fine&#8208;tuned through iterative feedback and expert suggestions. This workflow presents a potential for broader applications in scientific research by harnessing the capability of large language models like GPT&#8208;4 to enhance the feasibility and efficiency of research activities.

         <title>Fabrication of Pillar&#8208;Cage Fluorinated Anion Pillared Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks via a Pillar Embedding Strategy and Efficient Separation of SO2 through Multi&#8208;Site Trapping</title>

Pillar&#8208;cage fluorinated metal&#8208;organic frameworks were fabricated via a pillar embedding strategy and applied in the efficient separation of SO2 through multi&#8208;site trapping.







Abstract
Flue gas desulfurization is crucial for both human health and ecological environments. However, developing efficient SO2 adsorbents that can break the trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and selectivity is still challenging. In this work, a new type of fluorinated anion&#8208;pillared metal&#8211;organic frameworks (APMOFs) with a pillar&#8208;cage structure is fabricated through pillar&#8208;embedding into a highly porous and robust framework. This type of APMOFs comprises smaller tetrahedral cages and larger icosahedral cages interconnected by embedded [NbOF5]2&#8722; and [TaOF5]2&#8722; anions acting as pillars. The APMOFs exhibits high porosity and density of fluorinated anions, ensuring exceptional SO2 adsorption capacity and ultrahigh selectivity for SO2/CO2 and SO2/N2 gas mixtures. Furthermore, these two structures demonstrate excellent stability towards water, acid/alkali, and SO2 adsorption. Cycle dynamic breakthrough experiments confirm the excellent separation performance of SO2/CO2 gas mixtures and their cyclic stability. SO2&#8208;loaded single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, Grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the preferred adsorption domains for SO2 molecules. The multiple&#8208;site host&#8211;guest and guest&#8208;guest interactions facilitate selective recognition and dense packing of SO2 in this hybrid porous material. This work will be instructive for designing porous materials for flue gas desulfurization and other gas&#8208;purification processes.

         <title>Achiral Dichroic Dyes&#8208;mediated Circularly Polarized Emission Regulated by Orientational Order Parameter through Cholesteric Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy was developed for regulating circularly polarized luminescence performance by increasing the order parameter value of achiral dichroic dye in cholesteric liquid crystal media without changing the helical superstructure. Additionally, the circularly polarized luminescence and fluorescence intensity response (contrast ratio) was also improved as the order parameter value increased under the DC electric field. Efficient encryption could be achieved by modulating the structure of achiral dichroic dyes in cholesteric liquid crystals.







Abstract
It is noteworthy that cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) platforms have been witnessed in high&#8208;performance circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) behaviors through the highly organized chiral co&#8208;assembled arrangement of achiral dyes. However, most CPL&#8208;active design strategies are closely relative to the helix co&#8208;assembly structure of CLC rather than achiral dyes. Herein, we developed an intriguing regulation strategy for CPL&#8208;active CLC materials. They were regulated using the orientational order parameter (SF) of achiral dichroic dyes as an incisive probe for the order arrangement degree of achiral dyes in CLC media. The I&#8208;shaped phenothiazine derivative PHECN dye (SF=0.30) emitted a strong CPL signal (|glum|=0.47). In contrast, the T&#8208;shaped derivative (PHEBen) dye (SF=0.09) showed a weak circular polarization level (|glum|=0.07) at similar CLC textures. Most interestingly, this kind of dichroic PHECN dye with a higher SF could greatly improve the contrast ratio of CPL (&#916;glum=0.47) and emission intensity (&#916;FL=46.0&#8201;%) at direct&#8208;current electric field compared with the T&#8208;shaped PHEBen (&#916;glum=0.07 and &#916;FL=1.0&#8201;%) in CLC. This work demonstrates that an induced CPL emission can be mediated using achiral dichroic dye, which will open a new avenue for developing excellent CPL&#8208;active display materials.

         <title>Tetraphenylporphyrin&#8208;based Chelating Ligand Additive as a Molecular Sieving Interfacial Barrier toward Durable Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated a versatile &#8220;molecular sieve&#8208;like&#8221; interfacial barrier to efficiently expel free water molecules from IHP. Benefiting from the well&#8208;tailored ligand chelation engineering and the non&#8208;consumable nature of TPPS, the as&#8208;developed Zn||MnO2 full battery with TPPS exhibited enhanced reversible capacity and extended cyclability with negligible H2 evolution compared with cells using pristine ZnSO4 electrolyte.







Abstract
The sustained water consumption and uncontrollable dendrite growth strongly hamper the practical applications of rechargeable zinc (Zn) metal batteries (ZMBs). Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate that trace amount of chelate ligand additive can serve as a &#8220;molecular sieve&#8208;like&#8221; interfacial barrier and achieve highly efficient Zn plating/stripping. As verified by theoretical modeling and experimental investigations, the benzenesulfonic acid groups on the additive molecular not only facilitates its water solubility and selective adsorption on the Zn anode, but also effectively accelerates the de&#8208;solvation kinetics of Zn2+. Meanwhile, the central porphyrin ring on the chelate ligand effectively expels free water molecules from Zn2+ via chemical binding against hydrogen evolution, and reversibly releases the captured Zn2+ to endow a dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition. By virtue of this non&#8208;consumable additive, high average Zn plating/stripping efficiency of 99.7&#8201;% over 2100&#8197;cycles together with extended lifespan and suppressed water decomposition in the Zn||MnO2 full battery were achieved, thus opening a new avenue for developing highly durable ZMBs.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Supramolecular Polymerization of a Bis&#8208;Urea Macrocycle into a Brick&#8208;Like Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dendronized bis&#8208;urea macrocycle forms in bulk columnar liquid&#8208;crystalline phases, while in chlorinated solvents it self&#8208;assembles into two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanosheets with a brick&#8208;like organization. This exotic 2D assembly is enabled by solvent effects and a sophisticated hydrogen&#8208;bonding pattern, where each monomer interacts with four vicinal macrocycles only through urea&#8208;urea interactions.







Abstract
We report on a dendronized bis&#8208;urea macrocycle 1 self&#8208;assembling via a cooperative mechanism into two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanosheets formed solely by alternated urea&#8208;urea hydrogen bonding interactions. The pure macrocycle self&#8208;assembles in bulk into one&#8208;dimensional liquid&#8208;crystalline columnar phases. In contrast, its self&#8208;assembly mode drastically changes in CHCl3 or tetrachloroethane, leading to 2D hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks. Theoretical calculations, complemented by previously reported crystalline structures, indicate that the 2D assembly is formed by a brick&#8208;like hydrogen bonding pattern between bis&#8208;urea macrocycles. This assembly is promoted by the swelling of the trisdodecyloxyphenyl groups upon solvation, which frustrates, due to steric effects, the formation of the thermodynamically more stable columnar macrocycle stacks. This work proposes a new design strategy to access 2D supramolecular polymers by means of a single non&#8208;covalent interaction motif, which is of great interest for materials development.

         <title>Green Solvent Processable, Asymmetric Dopant&#8208;Free Hole Transport Layer Material for Efficient and Stable n&#8208;i&#8208;p Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hole transport layer material (BDT&#8208;C8&#8208;3O) for perovskite solar cells is designed, introducing an asymmetric polar oligo(ethylene glycol) side chain. It is capable of achieving high crystallinity even when processed from green solvents. The n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells based on chlorobenzene&#8208; or 3&#8208;methylcyclohexanone&#8208;processed BDT&#8208;C8&#8208;3O without dopant delivered world&#8208;record power conversion efficiencies of 24.11&#8201;% (certified of 23.82&#8201;%) and 23.53&#8201;%, respectively. The corresponding scaled modules (15.64&#8197;cm2) also deliver high PCEs over 20&#8201;%.







Abstract
The use of dopant&#8208;free hole transport layers (HTLs) is critical in stabilizing n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs). However, these HTL materials are often processed with toxic solvents, which is not ideal for industrial production. Upon substituting them with green solvents, a trade&#8208;off emerges between maintaining the high crystallinity of the HTL materials and ensuring high solubility in the new solvents. In this paper, we designed a novel, linear, organic small molecule, BDT&#8208;C8&#8208;3O, by introducing an asymmetric polar oligo(ethylene glycol) side chain. This method not only overcomes the solubility limitations in green solvents but also enables stacking the conjugated main chains in two patterns, which further enhances crystallinity and hole mobility. As a result, the n&#8208;i&#8208;p pero&#8208;SCs based on chlorobenzene&#8208; or green (natural compound) solvent 3&#8208;methylcyclohexanone&#8208;processed BDT&#8208;C8&#8208;3O HTL that without any dopant delivered world&#8208;recorded power conversion efficiencies of 24.11&#8201;% (certified of 23.82&#8201;%) and 23.53&#8201;%, respectively. The devices also demonstrated remarkable operational and high&#8208;temperature stabilities, maintaining over 84&#8201;% and 79.5&#8201;% of their initial efficiency for 2000&#8197;h, respectively. Encouragingly, dopant&#8208;free BDT&#8208;C8&#8208;3O HTL exhibits significant advantages in large&#8208;area fabrication, achieving state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PCEs exceeding 20&#8201;% for 5&#215;5&#8197;cm2 modules (active area: 15.64&#8197;cm2), even when processed using green solvents.

         <title>Improving Low&#8208;temperature Performance and Stability of Na2Ti6O13 Anodes by the Ti&#8722;O Spring Effect through Nb&#8208;doping</title>

Integrated effects of migration channels broadening, charge density re&#8208;distribution, and oxygen vacancies modulation are achieved via high valence state ion&#8208;doping in case of Nb5+. The modified samples optimized excellent long&#8208;cycle stability, and superior low&#8208;temperature performance in the full cell. Importantly, it is demonstrated for the first time that high&#8208;valent transition metal preferentially replaces the Ti3 site of NTO, effectively improving electrical conductivity and ion diffusion rate. More interestingly, the &#8220;spring effect&#8221; of chemical bonding, which is twisted&#8208;recovered&#8208;twisted with the motion of Na+, is investigated for the first time by in situ Raman, and the stabilizing effect of Nb enables the more regular and reversible &#8220;spring effect&#8221;.







Abstract
Na2Ti6O13 (NTO) with high safety has been regarded as a promising anode candidate for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. In the present study, integrated modification of migration channels broadening, charge density re&#8208;distribution, and oxygen vacancies regulation are realized in case of Nb&#8208;doping and have obtained significantly enhanced cycling performance with 92&#8201;% reversible capacity retained after 3000&#8197;cycles at 3000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. Moreover, unexpected low&#8208;temperature performance with a high discharge capacity of 143&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 under &#8722;15&#8201;&#176;C is also achieved in the full cell. Theoretical investigation suggests that Nb preferentially replaces Ti3 sites, which effectively improves structural stability and lowers the diffusion energy barrier. What's more important, both the in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and in situ Raman furtherly confirm the robust spring effect of the Ti&#8722;O bond, making special charge compensation mechanism and respective regulation strategy to conquer the sluggish transport kinetics and low conductivity, which plays a key role in promoting electrochemical performance.

         <title>Multivariate Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks with Tunable Permanent Porosities for Capture of a Mustard Gas Simulant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of isoreticular multivariate hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (MTV&#8208;HOFs) from pyrene&#8208;based derivatives bearing &#8722;H, &#8722;CH3, &#8722;NH2 and &#8722;F groups were synthesized by a shape&#8208;fitted, &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking self&#8208;assembly strategy. These single&#8208;crystalline materials are composed of tectons with as many as 4 different functionalities, which exhibit tunable hydrophobicity, and were shown to be capable of capturing a mustard gas simulant (CEES).







Abstract
Precise synthesis of topologically predictable and discrete molecular crystals with permanent porosities remains a long&#8208;term challenge. Here, we report the first successful synthesis of a series of 11 isoreticular multivariate hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (MTV&#8208;HOFs) from pyrene&#8208;based derivatives bearing &#8722;H, &#8722;CH3, &#8722;NH2 and &#8722;F groups achieved by a shape&#8208;fitted, &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking self&#8208;assembly strategy. These MTV&#8208;HOFs are single&#8208;crystalline materials composed of tecton, as verified by single&#8208;crystal diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, Raman spectra, water sorption isotherms and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. These MTV&#8208;HOFs exhibit tunable hydrophobicity with water uptake starting from 50 to 80&#8201;% relative humidity, by adjusting the combinations and ratios of functional groups. As a proof of application, the resulting MTV&#8208;HOFs were shown to be capable of capturing a mustard gas simulant, 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES) from moisture. The location of different functional groups within the pores of the MTV&#8208;HOFs leads to a synergistic effect, which resulted in a superior CEES/H2O selectivity (up to 94&#8201;%) compared to that of the HOFs with only pure component and enhanced breakthrough performance (up to 4000&#8197;min/g) when compared to benchmark MOF materials. This work is an important advance in the synthesis of MTV&#8208;HOFs, and provides a platform for the development of porous molecular materials for numerous applications.

         <title>Synthesis of Stereocontrolled Degradable Polymer by Living Cascade Enyne Metathesis Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stereocontrolled degradable polymer was synthesized via living cascade enyne metathesis polymerization from highly stereodefined N,O&#8208;acetal&#8208;containing enyne monomers, which were prepared by Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydroamination of alkoxyallene and ring&#8208;closing metathesis.







Abstract
A stereocontrolled degradable polymer was synthesized via living cascade enyne metathesis polymerization. Highly stereodefined N,O&#8208;acetal&#8208;containing enyne monomers were prepared using the Pd&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of alkoxyallenes and ring&#8208;closing metathesis. The resulting chiral polymer exhibited a narrow dispersity window. Block copolymers were prepared not only by sequentially adding nondegradable and degradable monomers but also by using enantiomerically different monomers to produce stereocontrolled blocks. Owing to the hydrolyzable N,O&#8208;acetal moiety in the backbone structure, the resulting polymer could degrade under acidic conditions generated using various acid concentrations to control the degradation. Additionally, the aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction modified the polymer without losing the stereochemistry.

         <title>A Coformer Approach for Supramolecular Polymerization at High Concentrations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A barbiturate &#960;&#8208;conjugated compound is poorly soluble in nonpolar solvent because of its organization through its hydrogen&#8208;bonding motifs into a crystalline polymorph prior to supramolecular polymerization. Mixing a &#8220;supramolecular coformer&#8221; compound with the parent compound provide highly soluble co&#8208;aggregates, enabling supramolecular polymerization at high concentrations.







Abstract
Insolubility of functional molecules caused by polymorphism sometimes poses limitations for their solution&#8208;based processing. Such a situation can also occur in the preparation processes of supramolecular polymers formed in a solution. An effective strategy to address this issue is to prepare amorphous solid states by introducing a &#8220;coformer&#8221; molecule capable of inhibiting the formation of an insoluble polymorph through co&#8208;aggregation. Herein, inspired by the coformer approach, we demonstrated a solubility enhancement of a barbiturate &#960;&#8208;conjugated compound that can supramolecularly polymerize through six&#8208;membered hydrogen&#8208;bonded rosettes. Our newly synthesized supramolecular coformer molecule features a sterically demanding methyl group in the &#960;&#8208;conjugated unit of the parent molecule. Although the parent molecule exhibits low solubility in nonpolar solvents due to the formation of a crystalline polymorph comprising a tape&#8208;like hydrogen&#8208;bonded array prior to the supramolecular polymerization, mixing with the coformer compound enhanced the solubility by inhibiting mesoscopic organization of the tapes. The two monomers were then co&#8208;polymerized into desired helicoidal supramolecular polymers through the formation of heteromeric rosettes.

         <title>Enantioconvergent Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Alkylation of Tertiary Allylic C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;chiral phosphoramidite&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular enantioconvergent alkylation of racemic tertiary allylic C&#8722;H bonds provides facile access to a range of enantioenriched allylic compounds featuring quaternary carbon stereocenters. The deracemization has been accomplished through a rate&#8208;limiting cleavage of racemic tertiary allylic C&#8722;H bonds to generate &#963;&#8208;allyl&#8208;Pd species, and the obtained E/Z&#8208;selectivity of &#963;&#8208;allyl&#8208;Pd species markedly regulates the diastereoselectivity via a nucleophile coordination&#8208;enabled SN2&#8242;&#8208;allylation pathway.







Abstract
Enantioconvergent catalysis enables the conversion of racemic molecules into a single enantiomer in perfect yield and is considered an ideal approach for asymmetric synthesis. Despite remarkable advances in this field, enantioconvergent transformations of inert tertiary C&#8722;H bonds remain largely unexplored due to the high bond dissociation energy and the surrounding steric repulsion that pose unparalleled constraints on bond cleavage and formation. Here, we report an enantioconvergent Pd&#8208;catalyzed alkylation of racemic tertiary allylic C&#8722;H bonds of &#945;&#8208;alkenes, providing a unique approach to access a broad range of enantioenriched &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds featuring quaternary carbon stereocenters. Mechanistic studies reveal that a stereoablative event occurs through the rate&#8208;limiting cleavage of tertiary allylic C&#8722;H bonds to generate &#963;&#8208;allyl&#8208;Pd species, and the achieved E/Z&#8208;selectivity of &#963;&#8208;allyl&#8208;Pd species effectively regulates the diastereoselectivity via a nucleophile coordination&#8208;enabled SN2&#8242;&#8208;allylation pathway.

         <title>Enhanced Metal&#8208;Support Interactions Boost the Electrocatalytic Water Splitting of Supported Ruthenium Nanoparticles on a Ni3N/NiO Heterojunction at Industrial Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of a Ni3N/NiO heterostructure in Ru&#8208;Ni3N/NiO results in a highly electroactive surface that ensures high electroactivity and alleviates the overbinding effect. The construction of a high&#8208;density triple&#8208;phase interface is achieved, with highly active catalytic sites for electrochemical water splitting, involving hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER).







Abstract
Developing highly efficient and stable hydrogen production catalysts for electrochemical water splitting (EWS) at industrial current densities remains a great challenge. Herein, we proposed a heterostructure&#8208;induced&#8208;strategy to optimize the metal&#8208;support interaction (MSI) and the EWS activity of Ru&#8208;Ni3N/NiO. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations firstly predicted that the Ni3N/NiO&#8208;heterostructures can improve the structural stability, electronic distributions, and orbital coupling of Ru&#8208;Ni3N/NiO compared to Ru&#8208;Ni3N and Ru&#8208;NiO, which accordingly decreases energy barriers and increases the electroactivity for EWS. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the Ru&#8208;Ni3N/NiO catalyst with a 2D Ni3N/NiO&#8208;heterostructures nanosheet array, uniformly dispersed Ru nanoparticles, and strong MSI, was successfully constructed in the experiment, which exhibited excellent HER and OER activity with overpotentials of 190&#8197;mV and 385&#8197;mV at 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. Furthermore, the Ru&#8208;Ni3N/NiO&#8208;based EWS device can realize an industrial current density (1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) at 1.74&#8197;V and 1.80&#8197;V under alkaline pure water and seawater conditions, respectively. Additionally, it also achieves a high durability of 1000&#8197;h (@ 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in alkaline pure water.

&lt;p&gt;The formation of a Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N/NiO heterostructure in Ru-Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N/NiO results in a highly electroactive surface that ensures high electroactivity and alleviates the overbinding effect. The construction of a high-density triple-phase interface is achieved, with highly active catalytic sites for electrochemical water splitting, involving hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER).

         <title>Narrowband Fluorescent Emitters Based on BN&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons for Efficient and Stable Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Narrowband green and red fluorescent emitters by fusing naphthalene with multi&#8208;resonance BN&#8208;doped frameworks manifest near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yields and narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maxima of 31&#8197;nm. The resulting electroluminescent devices achieve high external quantum efficiency, low efficiency roll&#8208;off and long operational lifetimes.







Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) using conventional fluorescent emitters are currently attracting considerable interests due to outstanding stability and abundant raw materials. To construct high&#8208;performance narrowband fluorophores to satisfy requirements of ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition displays, a strategy fusing multi&#8208;resonance BN&#8208;doped moieties to naphthalene is proposed to construct two novel narrowband fluorophores. Green Na&#8722;sBN and red Na&#8722;dBN, manifest narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maxima of 31&#8197;nm, near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yields and molecular horizontal dipole ratios above 90&#8201;%. Their OLEDs exhibit the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performances including high external quantum efficiencies (EQE), ultra&#8208;low efficiency roll&#8208;off and long operational lifetimes. The Na&#8722;sBN&#8208;based device achieves EQE as high as 28.8&#8201;% and remains 19.8&#8201;% even at luminance of 100,000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, and Na&#8722;dBN&#8208;based device acquires a record&#8208;high EQE of 25.2&#8201;% among all red OLEDs using pure fluorescent emitters.

Spin crossover metal&#8211;organic frameworks containing clusters as secondary building units are firstly realized, in which the clusters can be further removed via the post&#8208;synthetic modification.







Abstract
Spin crossover (SCO) materials with new architectures will expand and enrich the research in the SCO field. Here, we report two metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) containing tetradentate organic ligands and hexatopic linkers [Ag8X8(CN)6]6&#8722; (X=Br and I), which represents the first SCO MOF with clusters as building blocks. The silver halide cluster can be further removed after reacting with lithium tetracyanoquinodimethan (LiTCNQ). Such post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) is realized via single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformation from urk to nbo topology. Accordingly, the spin state and fluorescence properties are greatly modified by cluster deconstruction. Therefore, these achievements will provide new ideas for the design of new SCO systems and the development of PSM methods.

         <title>Precise Modulation of Intramolecular Aggregation&#8208;induced Electrochemiluminescence by Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based Supramolecular Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemiluminescence (ECL) properties of tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based supramolecular architectures are systematically studied. Their strong ECL emission is attributed to the following three factors: (i) restricted free rotation of the benzene ring, (ii) intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) in the conjugated donor&#8208;acceptor architecture, and (iii) electrostatic interactions between Zn2+ and the electrode surface.







Abstract
The precisely modulated synthesis of programmable light&#8208;emitting materials remains a challenge. To address this challenge, we construct four tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based supramolecular architectures (SA, SB, SC, and SD), revealing that they exhibit higher electrochemiluminescence (ECL) intensities and efficiencies than the tetraphenylethylene monomer and can be classified as highly efficient and precisely modulated intramolecular aggregation&#8211;induced electrochemiluminescence (PI&#8208;AIECL) systems. The best&#8208;performing system (SD) shows a high ECL cathodic efficiency exceeding that of the benchmark tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) chloride in aqueous solution by nearly six&#8208;fold. The electrochemical characterization of these architectures in an organic solvent provides deeper mechanistic insights, revealing that SD features the lowest electrochemical band gap. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the band gap of the guest ligand in the SD structure is the smallest and most closely matched to that of the host scaffold. Finally, the SD system is used to realize ECL&#8208;based cysteine detection (detection limit=14.4&#8197;nM) in real samples. Thus, this study not only provides a precisely modulated supramolecular strategy allowing chromophores to be controllably regulated on a molecular scale, but also inspires the programmable synthesis of high&#8208;performance aggregation&#8208;induced electrochemiluminescence emitters.

         <title>Enantioselective High&#8208;Throughput Assay Showcased for the Identification of (R)&#8208; as well as (S)&#8208;Selective Unspecific Peroxygenases for C&#8722;H Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;throughput assay was established to assess stereoselectivity, stereopreference, and activity in peroxygenase&#8208;catalyzed hydroxylation. The assay accurately predicts the ee value of the product with &#177;11&#8201;% accuracy. It enabled the discovery of novel wild&#8208;type fungal peroxygenases with remarkable enantioselectivity for both (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;alcohols. Homology models and docking studies supported the observed stereopreferences.







Abstract
Identifying (bio)catalysts displaying high enantio&#8208;/stereoselectivity is a fundamental prerequisite for the advancement of asymmetric catalysis. Herein, a high&#8208;throughput, stereoselective screening assay is reported that gives information on enantioselectivity, stereopreference and activity as showcased for peroxygenase&#8208;catalyzed hydroxylation. The assay is based on spectrophotometric analysis of the simultaneous formation of NAD(P)H from the alcohol dehydrogenase catalyzed enantioselective oxidation of the sec&#8208;alcohol product formed in the peroxygenase reaction. The assay was applied to investigate a library comprising 44 unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) containing 25 UPOs not reported yet. Thereby, previously non&#8208;described wild&#8208;type UPOs displaying (S)&#8208; as well as (R)&#8208;stereoselectivity for the hydroxylation of representative model substrates were identified, reaching up to 98&#8201;% ee for the (R)&#8208; and 94&#8201;% ee for the (S)&#8208;enantiomer. Homology models with concomitant docking studies indicated the structural reason for the observed complementary stereopreference.

&lt;p&gt;A high-throughput assay was established to assess stereoselectivity, stereopreference, and activity in peroxygenase-catalyzed hydroxylation. The assay accurately predicts the &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt; value of the product with &#177;11&#8201;% accuracy. It enabled the discovery of novel wild-type fungal peroxygenases with remarkable enantioselectivity for both (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)- and (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-alcohols. Homology models and docking studies supported the observed stereopreferences.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identifying (bio)catalysts displaying high enantio-/stereoselectivity is a fundamental prerequisite for the advancement of asymmetric catalysis. Herein, a high-throughput, stereoselective screening assay is reported that gives information on enantioselectivity, stereopreference and activity as showcased for peroxygenase-catalyzed hydroxylation. The assay is based on spectrophotometric analysis of the simultaneous formation of NAD(P)H from the alcohol dehydrogenase catalyzed enantioselective oxidation of the &lt;i&gt;sec&lt;/i&gt;-alcohol product formed in the peroxygenase reaction. The assay was applied to investigate a library comprising 44 unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) containing 25 UPOs not reported yet. Thereby, previously non-described wild-type UPOs displaying (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)- as well as (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-stereoselectivity for the hydroxylation of representative model substrates were identified, reaching up to 98&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt; for the (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)- and 94&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt; for the (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-enantiomer. Homology models with concomitant docking studies indicated the structural reason for the observed complementary stereopreference.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Negatively Curved &#960;&#8208;Expanded Pyracylene Comprising a Tropylium Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Negatively curved pyracylene scaffolds with an incorporated 7&#8208;membered ring were synthesized by progressive &#960;&#8208;expansion. The embedded tropone unit allowed facile generation of the aromatic tropylium cation, which displays considerable stability, near&#8208;infrared absorption, and characteristic structural features in the solid state.







Abstract
We disclose &#960;&#8208;expanded pyracylenes and their cationic species comprising 7&#8208;membered rings. The compounds were synthesized by stepwise oxidative cyclodehydrogenation to monitor the effect of successive cyclization on the structural and optoelectronic properties. As shown by X&#8208;ray crystallography, the complete cyclization leads to a boat&#8208;shaped scaffold featuring negative curvature provided by the 7&#8208;membered ring. The embedded tropone unit enabled the convenient generation of a stabilized tropylium cation, showing bathochromically shifted absorption bands reaching into the near&#8208;infrared region beyond 1000&#8197;nm. The altered structural features, supported by theoretical calculations, point towards the positively charged 7&#8208;membered ring having aromatic character.

         <title>Photocatalytic Enantioselective Hydrosulfonylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carbonyls with Sulfonyl Chlorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient enantioselective hydrosulfonylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls has been established, utilizing readily accessible sulfonyl chlorides, and facilitated by visible light irradiation in conjunction with chiral Ni&#8208;catalysis. This protocol enables the production of a diverse range of &#945;&#8208;chiral sulfones with remarkable enantioselectivity.







Abstract
This research explores the enantioselective hydrosulfonylation of various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds via the use of visible light and redox&#8208;active chiral Ni&#8208;catalysis, facilitating the synthesis of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;chiral sulfones with remarkable enantioselectivity (exceeding 99&#8201;% ee). A significant challenge entails enhancing the reactivity between chiral metal&#8208;coordinated carbonyl compounds and moderate electrophilic sulfonyl radicals, aiming to minimize the background reactions. The success of our approach stems from two distinctive attributes: 1) the Cl&#8208;atom abstraction employed for sulfonyl radical generation from sulfonyl chlorides, and 2) the single&#8208;electron reduction to produce a key enolate radical Ni&#8208;complex. The latter process appears to enhance the feasibility of the sulfonyl radical's addition to the electron&#8208;rich enolate radical. An in&#8208;depth investigation into the reaction mechanism, supported by both experimental observations and theoretical analysis, offers insight into the intricate reaction process. Moreover, the versatility of our methodology is highlighted through its successful application in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex bioactive molecules, demonstrating its practicality as a strategy for producing &#945;&#8208;chiral sulfones.

         <title>Nickel(II) Analogues of Phosphorescent Platinum(II) Complexes with Picosecond Excited&#8208;State Decay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Square planar Ni(II) complexes are potential alternatives to well&#8208;established isoelectronic Pt(II) and Au(III) luminophores. We identify the excited&#8208;state decay channels in two prototypical Ni(II) complexes and elucidate why the initially populated excited states decay within 1&#8197;ps. Clear guidelines for how to access long&#8208;lived and potentially luminescent excited states in square planar Ni(II) complexes emerge from this work.







Abstract
Square&#8208;planar NiII complexes are interesting as cheaper and more sustainable alternatives to PtII luminophores widely used in lighting and photocatalysis. We investigated the excited&#8208;state behavior of two NiII complexes, which are isostructural with two luminescent PtII complexes. The initially excited singlet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (1MLCT) excited states in the NiII complexes decay to metal&#8208;centered (3MC) excited states within less than 1 picosecond, followed by non&#8208;radiative relaxation of the 3MC states to the electronic ground state within 9&#8211;21&#8197;ps. This contrasts with the population of an emissive triplet ligand&#8208;centered (3LC) excited state upon excitation of the PtII analogues. Structural distortions of the NiII complexes are responsible for this discrepant behavior and lead to dark 3MC states far lower in energy than the luminescent 3LC states of PtII compounds. Our findings suggest that if these structural distortions could be restricted by more rigid coordination environments and stronger ligand fields, the excited&#8208;state relaxation in four&#8208;coordinate NiII complexes could be decelerated such that luminescent 3LC or 3MLCT excited states become accessible. These insights are relevant to make NiII fit for photophysical and photochemical applications that relied on PtII until now.

         <title>Long&#8208;Persistent Circularly Polarized Luminescence from a Host&#8208;Guest System Regulated by the Multiple Roles of a Gold(I)&#8208;Carbene Motif</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doping a monovalent Au&#8208;carbene complex into a boron&#8208;embedded molecular host has resulted in a host&#8211;guest system showing long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL), thus illustrating that third&#8208;row transition metals can be used to achieve LPL. The introduction of a chiral unit on the guest molecule provides a simple approach to obtain circularly polarized LPL multifunctional materials.







Abstract
The promotion of intersystem crossing (ISC) is critical for achieving a high&#8208;efficiency long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) from organic materials. However, the use of a transition&#8208;metal complex for LPL materials has not been explored because it can also shorten the emission lifetime by accelerating the phosphorescence decay. Here, we report a new class of LPL materials by doping a monovalent Au&#8208;carbene complex into a boron&#8208;embedded molecular host. The donor&#8208;acceptor systems exhibit photoluminescence with both high efficiencies (&gt;57&#8201;%) and long lifetimes (ca. 40&#8197;ms) at room temperature. It is revealed that the Au atom promotes the population of low&#8208;lying triplet excited states of the host aggregate (T1*) which can be converted into the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state, thereby resulting in afterglow luminescence. Moreover, the use of a chirality unit on the guest molecule results in the LPL being circularly polarized. This work illustrates that transition&#8208;metal complexes can be used for developing organic afterglow systems by exquisite control over the excited state mechanism.

         <title>An Oxysulfide Photocatalyst Evolving Hydrogen with an Apparent Quantum Efficiency of 30&#8201;% under Visible Light</title>

Single&#8208;crystalline, plate&#8208;like Gd2Ti2O5S2 particles with atomically ordered surfaces loaded with ultrafine composite cocatalyst particles evolve H2 from an aqueous methanol solution with a remarkable apparent quantum efficiency (AQY) of 30&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting is a simple means of converting solar energy into storable hydrogen energy. Narrow&#8208;band gap oxysulfide photocatalysts have attracted much attention in this regard owing to the significant visible&#8208;light absorption and relatively high stability of these compounds. However, existing materials suffer from low efficiencies due to difficulties in synthesizing these oxysulfides with suitable degrees of crystallinity and particle sizes, and in constructing effective reaction sites. The present work demonstrates the production of a Gd2Ti2O5S2 (&#955;&lt;650&#8197;nm) photocatalyst capable of efficiently driving photocatalytic reactions. Single&#8208;crystalline, plate&#8208;like Gd2Ti2O5S2 particles with atomically ordered surfaces were synthesized by flux and chemical etching methods. Ultrafine Pt&#8208;IrO2 cocatalyst particles that promoted hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) evolution reactions were subsequently loaded on the Gd2Ti2O5S2 while ensuring an intimate contact by employing a microwave&#8208;heating technique. The optimized Gd2Ti2O5S2 was found to evolve H2 from an aqueous methanol solution with a remarkable apparent quantum efficiency of 30&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm. This material was also stable during O2 evolution in the presence of a sacrificial reagent. The results presented herein demonstrates a highly efficient narrow&#8208;band gap oxysulfide photocatalyst with potential applications in practical solar hydrogen production.

         <title>A Porphyrin Iron(III) &#960;&#8208;Dication Species and its Relevance in Catalyst Design for the Umpolung of Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A key intermediate in bioinspired umpolung of nucleophiles is an iron(III) &#960;&#8208;dication. We identify that the meso&#8208;substituent of the porphyrin controls its accessibility and report the detailed study of an iron(III) &#960;&#8208;dication with the meso&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin ligand. We investigate the dynamics of the system and extensively characterize the species, providing crucial information for future catalyst design. Finally, we correlate the meso&#8208;substituent nature to catalytic chlorination reactivity.







Abstract
Isoporphyrins have recently been identified as remarkable species capable of turning the nucleophile attached to the porphyrin ring into an electrophile, thereby providing umpolung of reactivity (Inorg. Chem. 2022, 61, 8105&#8211;8111). They are generated by nucleophilic attack on an iron(III) &#960;&#8208;dication, a class of species that has received scant attention. Here, we explore the effect of the porphyrin meso&#8208;substituent and report a iron(III) &#960;&#8208;dication bearing the meso&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) ligand. We provide an extensive study of the species by UV/Vis absorption, 2H&#8197;NMR, EPR, applied field M&#246;ssbauer, and resonance Raman spectroscopy. We further explore the system's highly dynamic and tunable properties and address the nature of the axial ligands as well as the conformation of the porphyrin ring. The insights presented are essential for the rational design of catalysts for the umpolung of nucleophiles. Such catalytic avenues could for example provide a novel method for electrophilic chlorinations. We further examine the importance of electronic tuning of the porphyrin by nature of the meso&#8208;substituent as a factor in catalyst design.

         <title>Dearomative Ring&#8208;Fused Azafulleroids and Carbazole&#8208;Derived Metallofullerenes: Reactivity Dictated by Encapsulation in a Fullerene Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Divergent reactivities of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;diazidobiphenyls toward C60 and Sc3N@Ih&#8208;C80 have been disclosed. In the case of C60, a dearomative cascade reaction results in the formation of azafulleroids fused with a 7&#8208;6&#8208;5&#8208;membered ring system, whereas Sc3N@Ih&#8208;C80 undergoes a C&#8722;H insertion pathway, with the generation of carbazole&#8208;derived [6,6]&#8208; and [5,6]&#8208;azametallofulleroids and an unusual 1,2,3,6&#8208;tetrahydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;c]carbazole&#8208;derived metallofullerene.







Abstract
Herein, we report divergent additions of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;diazidobiphenyls to C60 and Sc3N@Ih&#8208;C80. In stark contrast to that of the previously reported bis&#8208;azide additions, the unexpected cascade reaction leads to the dearomative formation of azafulleroids 2 fused with a 7&#8208;6&#8208;5&#8208;membered ring system in the case of C60. In contrast, the corresponding reaction with Sc3N@Ih&#8208;C80 switches to the C&#8722;H insertion pathway, thereby resulting in multiple isomers, including a carbazole&#8208;derived [6,6]&#8208;azametallofulleroid 3 and a [5,6]&#8208;azametallofulleroid 4 and an unusual 1,2,3,6&#8208;tetrahydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;c]carbazole&#8208;derived metallofullerene 5, whose molecular structures have been unambiguously determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. Among them, the addition type of 5 is observed for the first time in all reported additions of azides to fullerenes. Furthermore, unexpected isomerizations from 3 to 5 and from 4 to 5 have been discovered, providing the first examples of the isomerization of an azafulleroid to a carbazole&#8208;derived fullerene rather than an aziridinofullerene. In particular, the isomerism of the [5,6]&#8208;isomer 4 to the [5,6]&#8208;isomer 5 is unprecedented in fullerene chemistry, contradicting the present understanding that isomerization generally occurs between [5,6]&#8208; and [6,6]&#8208;isomers. Control experiments have been carried out to rationalize the reaction mechanism. Furthermore, representative azafulleroids have been applied in organic solar cells, thereby resulting in improved power conversion efficiencies.

         <title>The Molecular Basis of Catalysis by SDR Family Members Ketoacyl&#8208;ACP Reductase FabG and Enoyl&#8208;ACP Reductase FabI in Type&#8208;II Fatty Acid Biosynthesis</title>

The distinct substrate allosteric recognition and reduction catalytic mechanisms of ketoacyl&#8208;ACP reductase FabG and enoyl&#8208;ACP reductase FabI in Type&#8208;II fatty acid biosynthesis are reported. The enzymes use alternative catalytic tunnels and core catalytic triads to recognize different ACP, NAD(P)H and fatty acid substrates for asymmetric reduction catalysis.







Abstract
The short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily members acyl&#8208;ACP reductases FabG and FabI are indispensable core enzymatic modules and catalytic orientation controllers in type&#8208;II fatty acid biosynthesis. Herein, we report their distinct substrate allosteric recognition and enantioselective reduction mechanisms. FabG achieves allosteric regulation of ACP and NADPH through ACP binding across two adjacent FabG monomers, while FabI follows an irreversible compulsory order of substrate binding in that NADH binding must precede that of ACP on a discrete FabI monomer. Moreover, FabG and FabI utilize a backdoor residue Phe187 or a &#8220;rheostat&#8221; &#945;8 helix for acyl chain length selection, and their corresponding triad residues Ser142 or Tyr145 recognize the keto&#8208; or enoyl&#8208;acyl substrates, respectively, facilitating initiation of nucleophilic attack by NAD(P)H. The other two triad residues (Tyr and Lys) mediate subsequent proton transfer and (R)&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxyacyl&#8208; or saturated acyl&#8208;ACP production.

     alt="The Molecular Basis of Catalysis by SDR Family Members Ketoacyl-ACP Reductase FabG and Enoyl-ACP Reductase FabI in Type-II Fatty Acid Biosynthesis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distinct substrate allosteric recognition and reduction catalytic mechanisms of ketoacyl-ACP reductase FabG and enoyl-ACP reductase FabI in Type-II fatty acid biosynthesis are reported. The enzymes use alternative catalytic tunnels and core catalytic triads to recognize different ACP, NAD(P)H and fatty acid substrates for asymmetric reduction catalysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily members acyl-ACP reductases FabG and FabI are indispensable core enzymatic modules and catalytic orientation controllers in type-II fatty acid biosynthesis. Herein, we report their distinct substrate allosteric recognition and enantioselective reduction mechanisms. FabG achieves allosteric regulation of ACP and NADPH through ACP binding across two adjacent FabG monomers, while FabI follows an irreversible compulsory order of substrate binding in that NADH binding must precede that of ACP on a discrete FabI monomer. Moreover, FabG and FabI utilize a backdoor residue Phe187 or a &#8220;rheostat&#8221; &#945;8 helix for acyl chain length selection, and their corresponding triad residues Ser142 or Tyr145 recognize the keto- or enoyl-acyl substrates, respectively, facilitating initiation of nucleophilic attack by NAD(P)H. The other two triad residues (Tyr and Lys) mediate subsequent proton transfer and (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-3-hydroxyacyl- or saturated acyl-ACP production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An NIR Fluorescence Turn&#8208;on and MRl Bimodal Probe for Concurrent Real&#8208;time in vivo Sensing and Labeling of &#946;&#8208;Galactosidase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bimodal imaging probe, Gal&#8208;Cy&#8208;Gd&#8208;1, has been developed to monitor &#946;&#8208;gal activity in real&#8208;time and to provide valuable assistance for precise tumour removal during surgery in vivo using NIR fluorescence and MRI. Activation of &#946;&#8208;gal results in an increase in the NIR fluorescence intensity, allowing sensitive covalent labeling of adjacent target enzymes or proteins to promote probe accumulation at the tumour site, facilitating high&#8208;resolution MRI.







Abstract
To realize sensing and labeling biomarkers is quite challenging in terms of designing multimodal imaging probes. In this study, we developed a novel &#946;&#8208;galactosidase (&#946;&#8208;gal) activated bimodal imaging probe that combines near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to enable real&#8208;time visualization of activity in living organisms. Upon &#946;&#8208;gal activation, Gal&#8208;Cy&#8208;Gd&#8208;1 exhibits a remarkable 42&#8208;fold increase in NIR fluorescence intensity at 717&#8197;nm, allowing covalent labeling of adjacent target enzymes or proteins and avoiding molecular escape to promote probe accumulation at the tumor site. This fluorescence reaction enhances the longitudinal relaxivity by approximately 1.9 times, facilitating high&#8208;resolution MRI. The unique features of Gal&#8208;Cy&#8208;Gd&#8208;1 enable real&#8208;time and precise visualization of &#946;&#8208;gal activity in live tumor cells and mice. The probe's utilization aids in identifying in situ ovarian tumors, offering valuable assistance in the precise removal of tumor tissue during surgical procedures in mice. The fusion of NIR fluorescence and MRI activation through self&#8208;immobilizing target enzymes or proteins provides a robust approach for visualizing &#946;&#8208;gal activity. Moreover, this approach sets the groundwork for developing other activatable bimodal probes, allowing real&#8208;time in vivo imaging of enzyme activity and localization.

         <title>Metamorphosis of a Commodity Plastic like PVC to Efficient Catalytic Single&#8208;Chain Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A complementary concept of polymeric waste valorization (upcycling) through metamorphosis in &#8220;green&#8221; media of an out&#8208;of&#8208;use piece of a daily life commodity plastic like polyvinyl chloride (PVC) to &#8220;valorized&#8221; PVC single&#8208;chain nanoparticles&#8212;useful as recyclable / metalloenzyme&#8208;mimetic catalyst for Cu(II)&#8208;catalyzed organic transformations&#8212;is reported.







Abstract
We perform the conversion of a commodity plastic of common use in pipes, window frames, medical devices, flexible hoses, etc. like polyvinyl chloride (PVC) to single&#8208;chain nanoparticles (SCNPs). SCNPs are versatile, protein&#8208;mimetic soft nano&#8208;objects of growing interest for catalysis, sensing, and nanomedicine, among other uses. We demonstrate that the metamorphosis process &#8208;as induced through metal&#8208;free click chemistry&#8208; leads to well&#8208;defined, uniform SCNPs that are stable during storage in the solid state for months. All the conversion process (from PVC isolation to PVC&#8208;SCNPs synthesis) can be run in a green, dipolar aprotic solvent and involving, when required, a simple mixture of ethanol and water (1/1&#8197;vol.) as non&#8208;solvent. The resulting PVC&#8208;SCNPs are investigated as recyclable, metalloenzyme&#8208;mimetic catalysts for several representative Cu(II)&#8208;catalyzed organic reactions. The method could be valid for the metamorphosis and valorization of other commodity plastics in which it is feasible to install azide functional groups in their linear polymer chains.

         <title>Biogenetic Chiral Deep Eutectic Solvents that Produce Self&#8208;Assembled Chiroptical Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transfer of chirality from chiral deep eutectic solvents (DESs) to achiral solutes has been used to control self&#8208;assembly. The DESs were prepared using choline chloride or cyclodextrin as hydrogen bonding acceptors and natural chiral acids as donors, with chirality amplification in the presence of minimal amounts of entrapped chiral acids occurring through the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the solutes during aggregation.







Abstract
Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) show particular properties compared to ionic liquids and other traditional organic solvents. Controlled synthesis of chiral materials in DESs is unprecedented due to the complex interplays between DESs and solutes. In this work, all bio&#8208;derived chiral DESs were prepared using choline chloride or cyclodextrin as hydrogen bonding acceptors and natural chiral acids as donors, which performed as chiral matrices for the rational synthesis of chiroptical materials by taking advantage of the efficient chirality transfer between the DESs and solutes. In a very selective manner, building units with molecular pockets could facilitate strong binding affinity towards chiral acid components of DESs disregarding the presence of competitive hydrogen bonding acceptors. Chirality transfer from DESs to nanoassemblies leads to chirality amplification in the presence of minimal amounts of entrapped chiral acids, thanks to the spontaneous symmetry breaking of solutes during aggregation. This work utilizes chiral DESs to control supramolecular chirality, and illustrates the structural basis for the fabrication of DES&#8208;based chiral materials.

         <title>Controllable Topological Transformations of 818 Molecular Metalla&#8208;knots by Oxidation of Thiazole&#8208;Based Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric dipyridyl ligand containing a thiazole moiety and two tetracene&#8208;based bimetallic building blocks have been used to synthesize two 818 molecular metalla&#8208;knots in high yields. Post&#8208;synthetic oxidation of the thiazole&#8208;based ligand under mild conditions resulted in the transformation of the 818 molecular metalla&#8208;knots into simple tetranuclear macrocycles.







Abstract
By exploiting coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, high yields of two 818 molecular metalla&#8208;knots could be obtained using a thiazole&#8208;moiety&#8208;containing asymmetric dipyridyl ligand 2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;5&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;ylethynyl)benzo[d]thiazole (L1), as confirmed using X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, electrospray ionization&#8208;time&#8208;of&#8208;flight/mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;TOF/MS), and detailed liquid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. To modulate the self&#8208;assembled structures, m&#8208;chloroperbenzoic acid (m&#8208;CPBA) was utilized to oxidize thiazole&#8208;based ligand L1 to N&#8208;thiazole&#8208;oxide&#8208;based ligand 2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;5&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;ylethynyl)benzo[d]thiazole 3&#8208;oxide (L2), which enabled the selective construction of the corresponding tetranuclear macrocycles. Notably, two molecular metalla&#8208;knots could be topologically transformed from 818 knots to simple monocycles because the L1 alkyne bond was inert toward m&#8208;CPBA, as confirmed by liquid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, ESI&#8208;TOF/MS, and elemental analysis.

         <title>Supramolecular Barrel&#8208;Rosette Ion Channel Based on 3,5&#8208;Diaminobenzoic Acid for Cation&#8208;Anion Symport</title>

Bis((R)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;mandelic acid)&#8208;linked 3,5&#8208;diaminobenzoic acid&#8208;based supramolecular barrel&#8208;rosette ion channels have been synthesized that possess a distinctive combination of hydrogen&#8208;bond forming and lone&#8208;pair donating groups within the channel cavity. This allows them to function as cation&#8208;anion symporters, with profound selectivity towards KClO4.







Abstract
The structural tropology and functions of natural cation&#8208;anion symporting channels have been continuously investigated due to their crucial role in regulating various physiological functions. To understand the physiological functions of the natural symporter channels, it is vital to develop small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based biomimicking systems that can provide mechanistic insights into the ion&#8208;binding sites and the ion&#8208;translocation pathways. Herein, we report a series of bis((R)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;mandelic acid)&#8208;linked 3,5&#8208;diaminobenzoic acid based self&#8208;assembled ion channels with distinctive ion transport ability. Ion transport experiment across the lipid bilayer membrane revealed that compound 1&#8201;b exhibits the highest transport activity among the series, and it has interesting selective co&#8208;transporting functions, i.e., facilitates K+/ClO4&#8722; symport. Electrophysiology experiments confirmed the formation of supramolecular ion channels with an average diameter of 6.2&#177;1&#8197;&#197; and single channel conductance of 57.3&#177;1.9&#8197;pS. Selectivity studies of channel 1&#8201;b in a bilayer lipid membrane demonstrated a permeability ratio of 
, 
, and 
 indicating the higher selectivity of the channel towards KClO4 over KCl salt. A hexameric assembly of a trimeric rosette of 1&#8201;b was subjected to molecular dynamics simulations with different salts to understand the supramolecular channel formation and ion selectivity pattern.

         <title>Photoswitchable and Reversible Fluorescent Eutectogels for Conformal Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the glowing sucker octopus, a reversible fluorescent eutectogel is prepared by incorporating anthracene groups as the photoswitchable fluorescent unit for conformal encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting, which can be reversibly written/erased with patterns by non&#8208;contact stimulation and conformally deform with arbitrary substrates. The developed eutectogel provides a promising strategy for the future development of advanced intelligent anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials.







Abstract
Smart fluorescent materials that can respond to environmental stimuli are of great importance in the fields of information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. However, traditional fluorescent materials usually face problems such as lack of tunable fluorescence and insufficient surface&#8208;adaptive adhesion, hindering their practical applications. Herein, inspired by the glowing sucker octopus, we present a novel strategy to fabricate a reversible fluorescent eutectogel with high transparency, adhesive and self&#8208;healing performance for conformal information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Using anthracene as luminescent unit, the eutectogel exhibits photoswitchable fluorescence and can therefore be reversibly written/erased with patterns by non&#8208;contact stimulation. Additionally, different from mechanically irreversible adhesion via glue, the eutectogel can adhere to various irregular substrates over a wide temperature range (&#8722;20 to 65&#8201;&#176;C) and conformally deform more than 1000&#8197;times without peeling off. Furthermore, by exploiting surface&#8208;adaptive adhesion, high transparency and good stretchability of the eutectogel, dual encryption can be achieved under UV and stretching conditions to further improve the security level. This study should provide a promising strategy for the future development of advanced intelligent anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of various oxygen&#8208;containing aromatic plastic wastes (PC, PET, PBT, and PPO) to cycloalkanes as liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) is reported by Sibao Liu, Guozhu Liu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202310505). The collected oxyen&#8208;containing aromatic plastic wastes such as bottles, key boards, cloth fibers, etc., are first sorted and washed by machine to ensure that these plastic wastes are pure enough to be chemically recycled. Then the sorted plastic wastes or their mixture are processed by HDO reaction over a catalytic system comprised of Ru&#8208;ReOx/SiO2 and HZSM&#8208;5.

         <dc:description>
Simple heating of muconic acid in water at high temperature in an autoclave under autogenic pressure provides levulinic acid in high yield, as described by Bert U.&#8197;W. Maes et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202309597). The method can also be applied to make substituted levulinic acids from the corresponding muconic acids. Lignin oil rich in propylguaiacol obtained from pine sawdust has been successfully transformed into 3&#8208;propyllevulinic acid.

A highly efficient &#946;&#8208;arabinofuranosylation utilizing boron&#8208;mediated aglycon delivery (BMAD) is presented by Kazunobu Toshima, Daisuke Takahashi, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202307015). The glycosylations proceeded smoothly for a variety of diols, triols, and unprotected sugar acceptors under mild conditions with predictable regioselectivity and complete &#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity. Furthermore, the cover image shows that the regioselectivity in the BMAD reaction could be reversed by examining the reaction conditions and catalyst.

Bioelectrocatalytic synthesis represents an exciting merger of selective biocatalysis and green electrochemical methods for the synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals. In this review we introduce the key concepts and vital applications of both enzymatic and microbial electrosynthetic systems.







Abstract
Bioelectrocatalytic synthesis is the conversion of electrical energy into value&#8208;added products using biocatalysts. These methods merge the specificity and selectivity of biocatalysis and energy&#8208;related electrocatalysis to address challenges in the sustainable synthesis of pharmaceuticals, commodity chemicals, fuels, feedstocks and fertilizers. However, the specialized experimental setups and domain knowledge for bioelectrocatalysis pose a significant barrier to adoption. This review introduces key concepts of bioelectrosynthetic systems. We provide a tutorial on the methods of biocatalyst utilization, the setup of bioelectrosynthetic cells, and the analytical methods for assessing bioelectrocatalysts. Key applications of bioelectrosynthesis in ammonia production and small&#8208;molecule synthesis are outlined for both enzymatic and microbial systems. This review serves as a necessary introduction and resource for the non&#8208;specialist interested in bioelectrosynthetic research.

         <title>Toward Sustainable Metal&#8208;Iodine Batteries: Materials, Electrochemistry and Design Strategies</title>

         <dc:description>
This review summarizes three types of iodine cathodes with their reaction mechanisms and highlights progress of various metal anodes and optimization strategies in metal&#8208;iodine batteries. The possibility of alternate metal anodes and their design strategy is enlightened. To build sustainable batteries, the key electrochemical parameters of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art metal&#8208;iodine batteries are compared and analyzed to solve critical issues.







Abstract
Due to the natural abundance of iodine, cost&#8208;effective, and sustainability, metal&#8208;iodine batteries are competitive for the next&#8208;generation energy storage systems with high energy density, and large power density. However, the inherent properties of iodine such as electronic insulation and shuttle behavior of soluble iodine species affect negatively rate performance, cyclability, and self&#8208;discharge behavior of metal&#8208;iodine batteries, while the dendrite growth and metal corrosion on the anode side brings potential safety hazards and inferior durability. These problems of metal&#8208;iodine system still exist and need to be solved urgently. Herein, we summarize the research progress of metal&#8208;iodine batteries in the past decades. Firstly, the classification, design strategy and reaction mechanism of iodine electrode are briefly outlined. Secondly, the current development and protection strategy of conventional metal anodes in metal&#8208;iodine batteries are highlighted, and some potential anode materials and their design strategies are proposed. Thirdly, the key electrochemical parameters of state&#8208;of&#8208;art metal&#8208;iodine batteries are compared and analyzed to solve critical issues for realizing next&#8208;generation iodine&#8208;based energy storage systems. Therefore, the aim of this review is to promote the development of metal&#8208;iodine batteries and provide guidelines for their design.

         <title>Oligomerized Fused&#8208;Ring Electron Acceptors for Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview discusses developments in oligomerized fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (OFREAs), which combine the advantages of small&#8208;molecule acceptors (well&#8208;defined structures and batch reproducibility) and polymer acceptors (good film formation, low diffusion coefficient, and excellent stability). OFREAs have a great potential to achieve highly efficient and stable organic solar cells.







Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted wide research attention in the past decades. Very recently, oligomerized fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (OFREAs) have emerged as a promising alternative to small&#8208;molecular/polymeric acceptor&#8208;based OSCs due to their unique advantages such as well&#8208;defined structures, batch reproducibility, good film formation, low diffusion coefficient, and excellent stability. So far, rapid advances have been made in the development of OFREAs consisting of directly/rigidly/flexibly linked oligomers and fused ones. In this Minireview, we systematically summarized the recent research progress of OFREAs, including structural diversity, synthesis approach, molecular conformation and packing, and long&#8208;term stability. Finally, we conclude with future perspectives on the challenges to be addressed and potential research directions. We believe that this Minireview will encourage the development of novel OFREAs for OSC applications.

         <title>Engineering of Therapeutic and Detoxifying Enzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Therapeutic enzymes have immense potential for treating human diseases, but their clinical application is hindered by the need for substantial improvement through protein engineering. Advanced techniques like design and directed evolution can enhance therapeutic enzymes, leading to biocatalysts with new therapeutic activities and high selectivity.







Abstract
Therapeutic enzymes present excellent opportunities for the treatment of human disease, modulation of metabolic pathways and system detoxification. However, current use of enzyme therapy in the clinic is limited as naturally occurring enzymes are seldom optimal for such applications and require substantial improvement by protein engineering. Engineering strategies such as design and directed evolution that have been successfully implemented for industrial biocatalysis can significantly advance the field of therapeutic enzymes, leading to biocatalysts with new&#8208;to&#8208;nature therapeutic activities, high selectivity, and suitability for medical applications. This minireview highlights case studies of how state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art and emerging methods in protein engineering are explored for the generation of therapeutic enzymes and discusses gaps and future opportunities in the field of enzyme therapy.

         <title>Materials Space&#8208;Tectonics: Atomic&#8208;level Compositional and Spatial Control Methodologies for Synthesis of Future Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent examples of material synthesis based on designing building blocks (i.e., tectons) and their hybridization. It provides practical guidelines for successfully implementing materials syntheses and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art examples of practical applications. Lastly, the potential integration of materials space&#8208;tectonics with emerging technologies, such as materials informatics, is discussed.







Abstract
Reactions occurring at surfaces and interfaces necessitate the creation of well&#8208;designed surface and interfacial structures. To achieve a combination of bulk material (i.e., framework) and void spaces, a meticulous process of &#8220;nano&#8208;architecting&#8221; of the available space is necessary. Conventional porous materials such as mesoporous silica, zeolites, and metal&#8211;organic frameworks lack advanced cooperative functionalities owing to their largely monotonous pore geometries and limited conductivities. To overcome these limitations and develop functional structures with surface&#8208;specific functions, the novel materials space&#8208;tectonics methodology has been proposed for future materials synthesis. This review summarizes recent examples of materials synthesis based on designing building blocks (i.e., tectons) and their hybridization, along with practical guidelines for implementing materials syntheses and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art examples of practical applications. Lastly, the potential integration of materials space&#8208;tectonics with emerging technologies, such as materials informatics, is discussed.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Cylindrocyclophanes A and F and Merocyclophanes A and D</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cylindrocyclophanes A and F and merocyclophanes A and D were synthesized by a chemoenzymatic approach. The synthesis features an enzymatic Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation, reagent&#8208;controlled lithiation&#8211;borylation chemistry, cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydroboration, and Ni&#8208; or Pd&#8208;catalyzed alkyl&#8211;alkyl cross&#8208;coupling.







Abstract
Incorporating enzymatic reactions into natural product synthesis can significantly improve synthetic efficiency and selectivity. In contrast to the increasing applications of biocatalytic functional&#8208;group interconversions, the use of enzymatic C&#8722;C bond formation reactions in natural product synthesis is underexplored. Herein, we report a concise and efficient approach for the synthesis of [7.7]paracyclophane natural products, a family of polyketides with diverse biological activities. By using enzymatic Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation, cylindrocyclophanes A and F and merocyclophanes A and D were synthesized in six to eight steps in the longest linear sequence. This study demonstrates the power of combining enzymatic reactions with contemporary synthetic methodologies and provides opportunities for the structure&#8211;activity relationship studies of [7.7]paracyclophane natural products.

         <title>Display Selection of a Hybrid Foldamer&#8211;Peptide Macrocycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reciprocal stapling of two helices, an aromatic foldamer helix and a peptide &#945;&#8208;helix, was observed in the conformation of a hybrid foldamer&#8211;peptide macrocycle when bound to the protein target against which it was selected. This intriguing shape and the possible contribution of the foldamer to protein binding highlight potential benefits of inserting a foldamer segment in display selection of macrocyclic peptides.







Abstract
Expanding the chemical diversity of peptide macrocycle libraries for display selection is desirable to improve their potential to bind biomolecular targets. We now have implemented a considerable expansion through a large aromatic helical foldamer inclusion. A foldamer was first identified that undergoes flexizyme&#8208;mediated tRNA acylation and that is capable of initiating ribosomal translation with yields sufficiently high to perform an mRNA display selection of macrocyclic foldamer&#8211;peptide hybrids. A hybrid macrocyclic nanomolar binder to the C&#8208;lobe of the E6AP HECT domain was selected that showed a highly converged peptide sequence. A crystal structure and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that both the peptide and foldamer are helical in an intriguing reciprocal stapling fashion. The strong residue convergence could be rationalized based on their involvement in specific interactions with the target protein. The foldamer stabilizes the peptide helix through stapling and through contacts with key residues. These results altogether represent a significant extension of the chemical space amenable to display selection and highlight possible benefits of inserting an aromatic foldamer into a peptide macrocycle for the purpose of protein recognition.

         <title>Synthesis of Levulinic Acids From Muconic Acids in Hot Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrolysis of biorenewable muconic acids or their corresponding lactones in high temperature water allows the selective synthesis of levulinic acids. This enables direct access to novel substituted levulinic acids from biomass, creating novel opportunities for industrial applications. 3&#8208;Propyllevulinic acid was used to synthesize a novel plasticizer which performed equally well as a commercial, petrochemical phthalate&#8208;based benchmark.







Abstract
Levulinic acid is a key biorenewable platform molecule. Its current chemical production from sugars is plagued by limited yields, char formation and difficult separations. An alternative and selective route starting from muconic acid via simple heating in water at high temperature (180&#8201;&#176;C) has been developed. Muconic acid can be obtained from sugars or catechol fermentation. Chemical oxidation of catechol is another possibility which advantageously can also be applied on substituted catechols, hereby providing substituted muconic acids. When applying the disclosed hydrothermal protocol on these substrates hitherto unknown substituted levulinic acids were accessed. In particular, 3&#8208;propyllevulinic acid has been synthesized from 4&#8208;propylcatechol, prepared from pine wood. This propylated derivative has been used for the synthesis of a 3&#8208;propyllevulinate diester, i.e. butane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyl bis(4&#8208;oxo&#8208;3&#8208;propylpentanoate), via esterification with 1,4&#8208;butanediol. The diester showed superior performance as plasticizer in comparison to the corresponding levulinate diester in both PVC (polyvinyl chloride) and PLA (polylactic acid). It plasticizes equally effective as the notorious commercial phthalate&#8208;based benchmark DEHP (di&#8208;2&#8208;ethylhexyl phthalate) in PVC.

         <title>Residual&#8208;Chemical&#8208;Shift&#8208;Anisotropy&#8208;Based Enantiodifferentiation in Lyotropic Liquid Crystalline Phases Based on Helically Chiral Polyacetylenes</title>

         <dc:description>
The residual chemical shift anisotropy can be acquired from enantiomers employing biphasic helically chiral polyacetylene liquid crystal from a single 1D carbon spectrum. The chiral environment of the liquid crystal facilitates diastereomorphous interactions of enantiomers and leads to two different sets of RCSAs. On the basis of two chiral molecules, it has been demonstrated that enantiodiscrimination is feasible







Abstract
Anisotropic NMR spectroscopy, revealing residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) and residual chemical shift anisotropies (RCSAs) has emerged as a powerful tool to determine the configurations of synthetic and complex natural compounds. The deduction of the absolute in addition to the relative configuration is one of the primary goals in the field. Therefore, the investigation of the enantiodiscriminating capabilities of chiral alignment media becomes essential. While RDCs and RCSAs are now used for the determination of the relative configuration routinely, RCSAs have not been measured in chiral alignment media such as chiral liquid crystals. Herein, we present this application by measuring RCSAs for chiral analytes such as indanol and isopinocampheol in the lyotropic liquid crystalline phase of an L&#8208;valine derived helically chiral polyacetylenes. We have also demonstrated that a single 1D 13C&#8722;{1H} NMR spectrum suffices to get the RCSAs circumventing the necessity to acquire two spectra at two alignment conditions.

         <title>A Two&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Perovskite With Heat Switching Birefringence</title>

A hybrid halide perovskite (C2N3H4)2PbCl4 exhibits heat switching birefringence which may be beneficial to the further development of stimuli&#8208;responsive polarization optical devices.







Abstract
Birefringent crystals that can switch light polarization have important applications in optoelectronics. In the last decades, birefringence is mostly optimized by chemical strategies. Recently, switching birefringence by physical means has attracted much attention. Here, this work reports the observation of heat switching birefringence in a 2D layered hybrid halide perovskite (C2N3H4)2PbCl4 ((C2N3H4)+=1,2,4&#8208;triazolium). This heat switching birefringence leads to a significant change in the interference color for the crystal plate under the illumination of orthogonal polarized light. Structure analyses reveal a heat dependent structure transition in (C2N3H4)2PbCl4, whose birefringence is switched by the change in the distortion degree of PbCl6 octahedron. This discovery may be beneficial to the further development of stimuli&#8208;responsive polarization optical devices.

         <title>Azopolyesters with Intrinsic Crystallinity and Photoswitchable Reversible Solid&#8208;to&#8208;Liquid Transitions</title>

Azobenzene&#8208;based polyesters (azopolyesters) from copolymerization of azobenzene&#8208;based epoxides with cyclic anhydrides possess remarkable intrinsic crystallinity and novel photoinduced reversible solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transition abilities, owing to photoinduced trans&#8208;cis isomerizations of azobenzenes being inlaid with soft alkyl side&#8208;chain. This represents a new design strategy for the synthesis of reversible adhesives.







Abstract
Herein, we introduce a variety of azopolyesters (azobenzene&#8208;based polyesters) with remarkable intrinsic crystallinity and photoinduced reversible solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transition abilities from copolymerization of azobenzene&#8208;based epoxides with cyclic anhydrides. The length of the soft alkyl side&#8208;chain inlaid with azobenzenes and stereoregularity of main&#8208;chain of azopolymers have tremendous effects on crystallization properties of the resulting polyesters with melting temperature (Tm) in the range of 51&#8211;251&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, some of azopolyesters possess excellently photoinduced reversible solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transition performance thanks to trans&#8208;cis photoisomerization of azobenzenes. Trans&#8208;azopolyesters are yellow solids with Tms or glass transition temperatures (Tgs) above room temperature, whereas cis&#8208;polymers are red liquids with Tgs below &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. These azopolyesters could be applied as novel light&#8208;switchable adhesives for quartz/quartz, wood/wood and quartz/wood adhesion, with the strength in the range of 0.73&#8211;0.89&#8197;MPa for trans&#8208;polymers. Conversely, the adhesion strength of liquefied cis&#8208;azopolyesters generated from the irradiation of trans&#8208;polymers by UV light was about 0.1&#8197;MPa, which shows light enable to control the adhesion process with high spatiotemporal resolution.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Boosted Kinetic and Selective Molecular Sieving of C6 Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>

Fluorine can improve the hydrophobic profile of leaning pillararenes, leading to a significant kinetic selectivity for benzene over cyclohexane (20&#8201;:&#8201;1).







Abstract
Porous molecular sorbents have excellent selectivity towards hydrocarbon separation with energy saving techniques. However, to realize commercialization, molecular sieving processes should be faster and more efficient compared to extended frameworks. In this work, we show that utilizing fluorine to improve the hydrophobic profile of leaning pillararenes affords a substantial kinetic selective adsorption of benzene over cyclohexane (20&#8201;:&#8201;1 for benzene).

&lt;p&gt;Fluorine can improve the hydrophobic profile of leaning pillararenes, leading to a significant kinetic selectivity for benzene over cyclohexane (20&#8201;:&#8201;1).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porous molecular sorbents have excellent selectivity towards hydrocarbon separation with energy saving techniques. However, to realize commercialization, molecular sieving processes should be faster and more efficient compared to extended frameworks. In this work, we show that utilizing fluorine to improve the hydrophobic profile of leaning pillararenes affords a substantial kinetic selective adsorption of benzene over cyclohexane (20&#8201;:&#8201;1 for benzene). The crystal structure shows a porous macrocycle that acts as a perfect match for benzene in both the intrinsic and extrinsic cavities with strong interactions in the solid state. The fluorinated leaning pillararene surpasses all reported organic molecular sieves and is comparable to the extended metal&#8211;organic frameworks that were previously employed for this separation such as UIO-66. Most importantly, this sieving system outperformed the well-known zeolitic imidazolate frameworks under low pressure, which opens the door to new generations of molecular sieves that can compete with extended frameworks for more sustainable hydrocarbon separation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>StereoPHIP: Stereoselective Parahydrogen&#8208;Induced Polarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Addition of parahydrogen to a prochiral enol pyruvate ester with chiral catalysts followed by polarization transfer to 13C affords highly 13C&#8208;hyperpolarized (over 20&#8201;%) L&#8208; and D&#8208;lactate derivatives with excellent stereoselectivity.







Abstract
Parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization (PHIP) followed by polarization transfer to 13C is a rapidly developing technique for the generation of 13C&#8208;hyperpolarized substrates. Chirality plays an essential role in living systems and differential metabolism of enantiomeric pairs of metabolic substrates is well documented. Inspired by asymmetric hydrogenation, here we report stereoPHIP, which involves the addition of parahydrogen to a prochiral substrate with a chiral catalyst followed by polarization transfer to 13C spins. We demonstrate that parahydrogen could be rapidly added to the prochiral precursor to both enantiomers of lactic acid (D and L), with both the (R,R) and (S,S) enantiomers of a chiral rhodium(I) catalyst to afford highly 13C&#8208;hyperpolarized (over 20&#8201;%) L&#8208; and D&#8208;lactate ester derivatives, respectively, with excellent stereoselectivity. We also show that the hyperpolarized 1H signal decays obtained with the (R,R) and (S,S) catalysts were markedly different. StereoPHIP expands the scope of conventional PHIP to the production of 13C hyperpolarized chiral substrates with high stereoselectivity.

         <title>When Is a Bond Broken? The Polarizability Perspective.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Static polarizability maxima along bond dissociation coordinates represent the onset of electron density localization and thus can used to be define when is a chemical bond broken.







Abstract
The question of when a chemical bond can be said to be broken is of fundamental chemical interest but has not been widely studied. Herein we propose that the maxima of static polarizability along bond dissociation coordinates naturally define cutoff points for bond rupture, as they represent the onset of localization of shared electron density into constituent fragments. Examples of computed polarizability maxima over the course of bond cleavage in main&#8208;group and transition metal compounds are provided, across covalent, dative and charge&#8208;shift bonds. The behavior along reaction paths is also considered. Overall, the static polarizability is found to be a sensitive reporter of electronic structure reorganization associated with bond stretching, and thus can serve as a metric for describing bond cleavage (or diagnose the absence of a chemical bond).

         <title>N=8 Armchair Graphene Nanoribbons: Solution Synthesis and High Charge Carrier Mobility
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
N=8 armchair graphene nanoribbons (AGNRs) were successfully synthesized in solution utilizing a custom arylated polynaphthalene precursor. The resulting 8&#8208;AGNR exhibits a noteworthy near&#8208;infrared absorption profile which signifies an exceptionally low optical band gap of 0.52&#8197;eV and demonstrates a record high dc charge&#8208;carrier mobility of up to 270&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
Structurally defined graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) have emerged as promising candidates for nanoelectronic devices. Low band gap (&lt;1&#8197;eV) GNRs are particularly important when considering the Schottky barrier in device performance. Here, we demonstrate the first solution synthesis of 8&#8208;AGNRs through a carefully designed arylated polynaphthalene precursor. The efficiency of the oxidative cyclodehydrogenation of the tailor&#8208;made polymer precursor into 8&#8208;AGNRs was validated by FT&#8208;IR, Raman, and UV/Vis&#8208;near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption spectroscopy, and further supported by the synthesis of naphtho[1,2,3,4&#8208;ghi]perylene derivatives (1 and 2) as subunits of 8&#8208;AGNR, with a width of 0.86&#8197;nm as suggested by the X&#8208;ray single crystal analysis. Low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and solid&#8208;state NMR analyses provided further structural support for 8&#8208;AGNR. The resulting 8&#8208;AGNR exhibited a remarkable NIR absorption extending up to &#8764;2400&#8197;nm, corresponding to an optical band gap as low as &#8764;0.52&#8197;eV. Moreover, optical&#8208;pump TeraHertz&#8208;probe spectroscopy revealed charge&#8208;carrier mobility in the dc limit of &#8764;270&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 for the 8&#8208;AGNR.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Activating Biomimetic Polyoxomolybdate for Boosting Oxygen Evolution in Neutral Electrolytes</title>

Electron&#8208;transfer photochromism is used to enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, providing an innovative design concept for the development of non&#8208;precious metal OER catalysts in artificial photosynthesis devices.







Abstract
Inspired by the metal&#8208;oxo cluster structural feature and charge separation behaviour of the oxygen evolving center (OEC) in photosystem II (PS&#8208;II) under photoirradiation, a new crystalline photochromic polyoxomolybdate, MV2[&#946;&#8208;Mo8O26] (1, MV=methyl viologen cation), is designed as a biomimetic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst in neutral electrolytes. After photoinduced electron transfer (PIET) with colour change from colourless to grey, it remains in an ultra&#8208;stable charge&#8208;separated state over a year under ambient conditions. The observed overpotential at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and Tafel slope decrease by 49&#8197;mV and 62.8&#8197;mV&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;dec&#8722;1 after coloration, respectively. The outstanding OER performance of the coloured state in neutral electrolytes even outperforms the commercial RuO2 benchmark. Experimental and theoretical studies show that oxygen holes within polyanions after irradiation serve as sites for enhancing direct O&#8722;O coupling, thus effectively promoting OER. This is the first successful application of electron&#8208;transfer photochromism to realize OER activity gain.

A gold&#8208;catalyzed chain&#8208;walking process is presented herein by employing a ligand&#8208;enabled Au(I)/Au(III) redox catalysis. This process is harnessed to develop a novel gold&#8208;catalyzed annulation reaction of alkenes with iodoarenes by leveraging the interplay of chain&#8208;walking and &#960;&#8208;activation reactivity mode.







Abstract
The successful realization of gold&#8208;catalyzed chain&#8208;walking reactions, facilitated by ligand&#8208;enabled Au(I)/Au(III) redox catalysis, has been reported for the first time. This breakthrough has led to the development of gold&#8208;catalyzed annulation reaction of alkenes with iodoarenes by leveraging the interplay of chain&#8208;walking and &#960;&#8208;activation reactivity mode. The reaction mechanism has been elucidated through comprehensive experimental and computational studies.

         <title>Photoredox Cascade Catalyst for Efficient Hydrogen Production with Biomass Photoreforming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new photoredox cascade photocatalyst consisting of dual&#8208;dye sensitized Pt&#8208;TiO2 nanoparticle photocatalyst and 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine 1&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO) molecular catalyst was constructed. The system produced H2 efficiently under blue&#8208;light to simultaneously generate one&#8208;electron oxidized TEMPO+ that oxidized various biomass substrates ranging from water&#8208;soluble glycerol to insoluble cellulose.







Abstract
Biomass photoreforming is a promising method to provide both a clean energy resource in the form of hydrogen (H2) and valuable chemicals as the results of water reduction and biomass oxidation. To overcome the poor contact between heterogeneous photocatalysts and biomass substrates, we fabricated a new photoredox cascade catalyst by combining a homogeneous catalyst, 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine 1&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO), and a heterogeneous dual&#8208;dye sensitized photocatalyst (DDSP) composed of two Ru(II)&#8208;polypyridine photosensitizers (RuP6 and RuCP6) and Pt&#8208;loaded TiO2 nanoparticles. During blue&#8208;light irradiation (&#955;=460&#177;15&#8197;nm; 80&#8197;mW), the DDSP photocatalytically reduced aqueous protons to form H2 and simultaneously oxidized TEMPO&#8226; radicals to generate catalytically active TEMPO+. It oxidized biomass substrates (water&#8208;soluble glycerol and insoluble cellulose) to regenerate TEMPO&#8226;. In the presence of N&#8208;methyl imidazole as a proton transfer mediator, the photocatalytic H2 production activities for glycerol and cellulose reforming reached 2670 and 1590&#8197;&#956;mol H2 (gTiO2)&#8722;1&#8197;h&#8722;1, respectively, which were comparable to those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art heterogeneous photocatalysts.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Synthesis of P&#8208;Stereogenic Phosphanyl Hydrazine Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first asymmetric synthesis of P&#8208;stereogenic phosphanyl hydrazines via nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric addition of primary phosphines to azo compounds. We anticipate that the remarkable versatility of these P&#8208;stereogenic secondary aminophosphines will facilitate the facile synthesis of both previously known and novel P&#8208;stereogenic compounds.







Abstract
Catalytic asymmetric methods for the synthesis of synthetically versatile P&#8208;stereogenic building blocks offer an efficient and practical approach for the diversity&#8208;oriented preparation of P&#8208;chiral phosphorus compounds. Herein, we report the first nickel&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of P&#8208;stereogenic secondary aminophosphine&#8208;boranes by the asymmetric addition of primary phosphines to azo compounds. We further demonstrate that the P&#8722;H and P&#8722;N bonds on these phosphanyl hydrazine building blocks can be reacted sequentially and stereospecifically to access various P&#8208;stereogenic compounds with structural diversity.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Distribution&#8208;Directed Regioselective Substitution Strategy for Highly Stable Olympicenyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spin&#8208;distribution&#8208;directed protection&#8211;oxidation&#8211;protection (P&#8722;O&#8722;P) strategy was developed for olympicenyl radical, which resulted in a series of highly stable &#960;&#8208;radicals. The substitution on the periphery exerted a substantial influence on the crystal packing, leading to the first stable field&#8208;effect transistor based on graphenic radicals.







Abstract
The synthesis of bench&#8208;stable conjugated &#960;&#8208;radicals is challenging owing to the lack of modular approaches, which greatly hampers their practical material screens and applications. Here, we demonstrate a spin&#8208;distribution&#8208;directed regioselective substitution strategy to introduce substituents into the specific positions of an olympicenyl radical in a stepwise manner, resulting in a series of highly stable radical species. The substituents can also adjust the crystal packing by means of steric and electronic factors, enabling the changing from a &#960;&#8208;dimer to a pseudo&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional chain. The first single crystal organic field&#8208;effect transistor device based on a graphenic radical is fabricated in air, showing a hole mobility of up to 0.021&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and excellent device stability. This approach may be generalized to diverse spin&#8208;delocalized open&#8208;shell organic radicals.

         <title>Infinite Twisted Polycatenanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise approach was developed to construct figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight polycatenanes using preorganized double helicates as templates and crosslinking them with silver ions or ethynylene units. Employing Ag(I) ions or ethynylene units as linkers resulted in single&#8208;crystalline 1D coordination poly[n]catenanes and assembling gel fibers, respectively.







Abstract
Poly[n]catenanes have exceptional mechanical bonding properties that give them tremendous potential for use in the development of molecular machines and soft materials. Synthesizing these compounds has, however, proven to be a formidable challenge. Herein, we describe a concise method for the construction of twisted polycatenanes. Our approach involves using preorganized double helicates as templates, linked crosswise in a linear fashion by either silver ions or triple bonds. By using this approach, we successfully synthesized twisted polycatenanes with both coordination and covalent bonding employing Ag(I) ions and ethynylene units, respectively, as the linkages and leveraging the same Ag(I)&#8208;templated double helicate in both cases. Synthesis with Ag(I) ions formed a single&#8208;crystalline one&#8208;dimensional (1D) coordination poly[n]catenane, and synthesis using ethynylene units generated 1D fibers which self&#8208;assembled with solvents to form a gel. Our results confirm the potential of multi&#8208;stranded metallohelicates for creating sophisticated mechanically interlocked molecules and polymers, which could pave the way for exploration in the realms of molecular nanotopology and materials design.

Synthesis with Ag(I) ions formed a single-crystalline one-dimensional (1D) coordination poly[&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]catenane, and synthesis using ethynylene units generated 1D fibers which self-assembled with solvents to form a gel. Our results confirm the potential of multi-stranded metallohelicates for creating sophisticated mechanically interlocked molecules and polymers, which could pave the way for exploration in the realms of molecular nanotopology and materials design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
