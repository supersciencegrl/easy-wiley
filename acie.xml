         <title>Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Synthesis of a Polymer in Two Distinct Topologies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A squaramide&#8208;based monomer, designed for topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) polymerization, crystallizes as two polymorphs,&#160;M1&#160;and&#160;M2, both having crystal packing suitable for topochemical polymerization. The hydrogen&#8208;bonding between squaramide units&#160;&#160;bias the molecular organization in both the polymorphs. 3D packing of H&#8208;bonded stacks of monomer lead to juxtaposition of&#160;&#160;azide and alkyne units of adjacent molecules in a transition&#8208;state&#8208;like arrangement for their regiospecific cycloaddition reaction. The monomers are arranged as supramolecular sheets and supramolecular helices in polymorph&#160;M1&#160;and&#160;M2&#160;respectively. Both the polymorphs undergo slow and spontaneous regiospecific TAAC polymerization at room temperature, but react quickly at higher temperatures, resulting in 1,4&#8208;traizolyl&#8208;linked polymer, with distinct mechanical responses. Upon heating, single crystals of polymorph&#160;M1&#160;show expansion followed by contraction without any permanent dimensional change, whereas crystals of polymorph&#160;M2&#160;undergo splitting. At moderate temperatures, both the polymorphs undergo single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) polymerization, resulting in two polymer&#8208;polymorphs with distinct topologies that can be studied at atomic resolution by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography.

         <title>Mesoporous Cu Nanoplates with Exposed Cu+ Sites for Efficient Electrocatalytic Transfer Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoporous copper nanoplates were prepared by a facile epitaxial growth strategy with the thiol&#8208;functional surfactant as concurrent mesopore&#8208;forming and structure&#8208;controlled template. The product featured oxidated Cu+ sites around mesopores, which stabilized active hydrogen radicals and facilitated transfer semi&#8208;hydrogenation reaction for selective alkene electrosynthesis.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic transfer alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation with H2O as hydrogen source is industrially promising for selective electrosynthesis of high value&#8208;added alkenes while inhibiting byproduct alkanes. Although great achievements, their development has remarkably restricted by designing atomically sophisticated electrocatalysts. Here, we reported single&#8208;crystalline mesoporous copper nanoplates (meso&#8208;Cu PLs) as a robust yet highly efficient electrocatalyst for selective alkene electrosynthesis from transfer semi&#8208;hydrogenation reaction of alkyne in H2O. Anisotropic meso&#8208;Cu PLs were prepared through a facile epitaxial growth strategy with functional C22H45N(CH3)2&#8208;C3H6&#8208;SH as concurrent mesopore&#8208;forming and structure&#8208;controlled surfactant. Different to nonporous Cu counterparts with flat surface, meso&#8208;Cu PLs with spherical mesopores exposed abundant Cu+ sites, which not only stabilized active H* radicals from electrocatalytic H2O splitting without coupling into molecular H2 but also accelerated kinetically the desorption of semi&#8208;hydrogenated alkenes. With 4&#8208;aminophenylacetylene (4&#8208;AP) as the substrate, anisotropic meso&#8208;Cu PLs delivered superior electrocatalytic transfer semi&#8208;hydrogenation performance with up to 99&#8201;% of 4&#8208;aminostyrene selectivity and 100&#8201;% of 4&#8208;AP conversion as well as good cycle stability. Meanwhile, meso&#8208;Cu PLs were electrocatalytically applicable for transfer semi&#8208;hydrogenation of various alkynes. This work thus paved an alternative paradigm for designing robust mesoporous metal electrocatalysts with structurally functional metal sites applied in the selective electrosynthesis of industrially value&#8208;added chemicals in H2O.

         <title>Carving Metal&#8211;Organic&#8211;Framework Glass Based Solid&#8211;State Electrolyte Via a Top&#8211;Down Strategy for Lithium&#8211;Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a top&#8208;down strategy to carve MOF glass&#8208;based polymer solid electrolytes (PSEs) with different pore structures. The carved MOF glass&#8208;based PSEs retains safety while also possessing fast ions transport performance. The introduced dispersed macropores can act like bridges, connecting nearby transport units to accelerate ion transport and provides rich transport path for ions transfer. Taking advantage of the cross&#8208;linked ion&#8208;conductive paths constructed by hierarchical pore structure, a high ionic conductivity of 1.9&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 was achieved for the porous MOF glass &#8208;PSEs.







Abstract
Traditional polymer solid electrolytes (PSEs) suffer from low ions conductivity, poor kinetics and safety concerns. Here, we present a novel porous MOF glass gelled polymer electrolyte (PMG&#8208;GPE) prepared via a top&#8208;down strategy, which features a unique three&#8208;dimensional interconnected graded&#8208;aperture structure for efficient ions transport. Comprehensive analyses, including time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF&#8208;SIMS), Solid&#8208;state 7Li magic&#8208;angle&#8208;spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS&#8197;NMR), Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, and electrochemical tests, quantify the pore structures, revealing their relationship with ions conductivity that increases and then decreases as macropore proportion rises. The introduced dispersed macropores (17&#8201;% fraction) can serve as bridges, connecting adjacent transport units to accelerate ions transport. Taking advantage of the cross&#8208;linked ion&#8208;conductive paths constructed by hierarchical pore structures, the PMG&#8208;GPE achieves a high ions conductivity of 1.9&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1. Additionally, the robust mechanical properties of PMG&#8208;GPE effectively suppress dendrite growth and penetration, outperforming crystal MOF&#8208;based electrolytes. The prepared Li symmetric batteries with PMG&#8208;GPE demonstrate a high critical current density of 5.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (two times higher than crystal MOF&#8208;electrolytes) and stable cycling for over 6000&#8197;hours without short circuits. Furthermore, a Li/PMG&#8208;GPE/LFP half&#8208;cell exhibits exceptional capacity retention of 83.12&#8201;% after 1400 cycles. These findings highlight the potential of structural design in advancing PSE performance, offering a promising pathway for the commercialization of high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Bioinspired Photo&#8208;Thermal Catalytic System Using Covalent Organic Framework&#8208;Based Aerogel for Synchronous Seawater Desalination and H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by natural photosynthesis system, we develop herein an artificial solar energy converter (ASEC) architecture assembled by depositing (CNT) units as &#8220;artificial chlorophyll&#8221; on ordered ionic COF aerogel as reactors and transporters. The ASEC demonstrates a total solar energy conversion (SEC) value of 8047&#8197;kJ&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1, corresponding to parallel production freshwater and H2O2 with rates of 3.56&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 and 19&#8197;mM&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1, respectively.







Abstract
Efficient utilization of solar energy is widely regarded as a crucial solution to addressing the energy crisis and reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Coupling photothermal and photochemical conversion can effectively improve solar energy utilization yet remains challenging. Here, inspired by the photosynthesis system in green plants, we report herein an artificial solar energy converter (ASEC) composed of light&#8208;harvesting units as solar collector and oriented ionic hydrophilic channels as reactors and transporters. Based on such architecture, the obtained ASEC (namely ASEC&#8208;NJFU&#8208;1) can efficiently realize parallel production of freshwater and H2O2 from natural seawater under natural light. The total solar energy conversion (SEC) of ASEC&#8208;NJFU&#8208;1 reaches up to 8047&#8197;kJ&#8197;m&#8722;2&#8197;h&#8722;1, corresponding to production rates of freshwater and H2O2 are 3.56&#8197;kg&#8197;m&#8722;2&#8722;1&#8197;h&#8722;1 and 19&#8197;mM&#8197;m&#8722;2&#8197;h&#8722;1, respectively, which is a record&#8208;high value among all photothermal&#8208;photocatalytic systems reported to date. Mechanism investigation of combining spectrum and experimental studies indicated that the high SEC performance for ASEC&#8208;NJFU&#8208;1 was attributed to the presence of plant bioinspired architecture with carbon nanotubes as solar&#8208;harvestor and COF&#8208;based oriented aerogel as reactors and transporters. Our work thus establishes a novel artificial photosynthesis system for highly efficient solar energy utilization.

The ASEC demonstrates a total solar energy conversion (SEC) value of 8047&#8197;kJ&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, corresponding to parallel production freshwater and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with rates of 3.56&#8197;kg&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 19&#8197;mM&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficient utilization of solar energy is widely regarded as a crucial solution to addressing the energy crisis and reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Coupling photothermal and photochemical conversion can effectively improve solar energy utilization yet remains challenging. Here, inspired by the photosynthesis system in green plants, we report herein an artificial solar energy converter (ASEC) composed of light-harvesting units as solar collector and oriented ionic hydrophilic channels as reactors and transporters. Based on such architecture, the obtained ASEC (namely ASEC-NJFU-1) can efficiently realize parallel production of freshwater and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from natural seawater under natural light. The total solar energy conversion (SEC) of ASEC-NJFU-1 reaches up to 8047&#8197;kJ&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, corresponding to production rates of freshwater and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are 3.56&#8197;kg&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 19&#8197;mM&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, which is a record-high value among all photothermal-photocatalytic systems reported to date. Mechanism investigation of combining spectrum and experimental studies indicated that the high SEC performance for ASEC-NJFU-1 was attributed to the presence of plant bioinspired architecture with carbon nanotubes as solar-harvestor and COF-based oriented aerogel as reactors and transporters. Our work thus establishes a novel artificial photosynthesis system for highly efficient solar energy utilization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dehydration&#8208;enhanced Ion Recognition of Triazine Covalent Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;resolution Li+/Mg2+ Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mimicking biological ion channels constructed negative electrical energy Well in the TAT&#8208;TP&#8208;P membrane and precisely modulated the pore environment, which endowed the TAT&#8208;TP&#8208;P membrane with excellent ion recognition capability. This property enabled the TAT&#8208;TP&#8208;P membrane to exhibit high&#8208;precision Li+/Mg2+ separation performance, realizing the efficient extraction of lithium resources.







Abstract
The precise and rapid extraction of lithium from salt&#8208;lake brines is critical to meeting the global demand for lithium resources. However, it remains a major challenge to design ion&#8208;transport membranes with accurate recognition and fast transport path for the target ion. Here, we report a triazine covalent organic framework (COF) membrane with high resolution for Li+ and Mg2+ that enables fast Li+ transport while almost completely inhibiting Mg2+ permeation. The remarkably high rejection of Mg2+ by the COF membrane is achieved via imposed ion dehydration and the construction of the energy well. The proper hydrophilic environment of the COF channel promotes the dissociation of Li+ from the negatively charged functional groups, allowing Li+ for hopping transport supported by the sulfonate side&#8208;chains to shorten the diffusion path of Li+. Under high&#8208;salinity electrodialysis conditions, the COF membrane demonstrates robust Li+/Mg2+ separation performance (No Mg2+ were detected in the collected solution), achieving efficient lithium recovery and high product purity (Li2CO3: 99.3&#8201;%). This membrane design strategy enables high energy efficiency and powerful lithium extraction in the electrodialysis lithium extraction process, and can be generalized to other energy and separation related membranes.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adaptive Activation of DNAzyme Nanoassembly for Synergistically Combined Gene Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The DNA nanoassembly with a built&#8208;in RNA walker system was programmed for endogenous miR&#8208;10b&#8208;triggered successive decaging of therapeutic DNAzyme, and the as&#8208;integrated negative feedback loop could counteract the overexpressed TWIST/miR&#8208;10b for abrogated tumor metastasis and chemo&#8208;resistance.







Abstract
DNAzyme represents a promising gene silencing toolbox yet is obstructed by the poor substrate accessibility in specific cells. Herein, a compact DNA nanoassembly, incorporating multimeric therapeutic DNAzyme, was prepared for selective delivery of gene&#8208;silencing DNAzyme with requisite cofactors and auxiliary chemo&#8208;drugs. By virtue of the sequence&#8208;conservative duplex&#8208;specific nuclease, the endogenous miRNA catalyzes the successive and site&#8208;specific cleavage of DNA nanoassembly substrate (nominated as the localized RNA walking machine) and thus ensures the liberation/activation of therapeutic agents with high accuracy and efficacy. The miR&#8208;10b&#8208;stimulated DNAzyme was designed to downregulate the TWIST transcription factor, an upstream promotor of miR&#8208;10b, thus acquiring the self&#8208;sufficient downregulation of TWIST/miR&#8208;10b signaling nodes (self&#8208;adaptive negative feedback loop) for abrogating tumor metastasis and chemo&#8208;resistance issues.

         <title>Transforming Aryl&#8208;Tetrazines into Bioorthogonal Scissors for Systematic Cleavage of trans&#8208;Cyclooctenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly reactive aryl&#8208;tetrazines are widely used for fast bioorthogonal ligation. However, their application in click&#8208;to&#8208;release chemistry has been impeded by significantly limited release efficiency. To address this challenge, we introduced hydroxyl functionalities to direct and accelerate post&#8208;click tautomerization, resulting in hydroxyaryl&#8208;tetrazines as bioorthogonal tools for highly efficient click&#8208;to&#8208;release of trans&#8208;cyclooctenes.







Abstract
Bioorthogonal bond&#8208;cleavage reactions have emerged as a powerful tool for precise spatiotemporal control of (bio)molecular function in the biological context. Among these chemistries, the tetrazine&#8208;triggered elimination of cleavable trans&#8208;cyclooctenes (click&#8208;to&#8208;release) stands out due to high reaction rates, versatility, and selectivity. Despite an increasing understanding of the underlying mechanisms, application of this reaction remains limited by the cumulative performance trade&#8208;offs (i.e., click kinetics, release kinetics, release yield) of existing tools. Efficient release has been restricted to tetrazine scaffolds with comparatively low click reactivity, while highly reactive aryl&#8208;tetrazines give only minimal release. By introducing hydroxyl groups onto phenyl&#8208; and pyridyl&#8208;tetrazine scaffolds, we have developed a new class of &#8216;bioorthogonal scissors&#8217; with unique chemical performance. We demonstrate that hydroxyaryl&#8208;tetrazines achieve near&#8208;quantitative release upon accelerated click reaction with cleavable trans&#8208;cyclooctenes, as exemplified by click&#8208;triggered activation of a caged prodrug, intramitochondrial cleavage of a fluorogenic probe (turn&#8208;on) in live cells, and rapid intracellular bioorthogonal disassembly (turn&#8208;off) of a ligand&#8208;dye conjugate.

         <title>Synthesis, Stable Radical Anion and Energy Storage Performance of Pentacene Tetraimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acene with multiple imide functions, 1,4,5,7,8,11,12,14&#8208;pentacene tetraimide (PeTI), is synthesized in three steps by the breaking and mending of naphthalene diimides. Both PeTI and its anionic species PeTI&#8208;CoCp2 display near&#8208;infrared absorption and extraordinary stability. The dealkylated PeTI, named PeTCTI, manifests state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art energy storage performance in organic potassium ion batteries as an anode.







Abstract
Imide functionalization has been widely proved to be an effective approach to enrich optoelectronic properties of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). However, appending multiple imide groups onto linear acenes is still a synthetic challenge. Herein, we demonstrate that by taking advantage of a &#8220;breaking and mending&#8221; strategy, a linear pentacene tetraimides (PeTI) was synthesized through a three&#8208;step sequence started from the naphthalene diimides (NDI). Compared with the parent pentacene, PeTI shows a deeper&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level, narrower band gap and better stability. The redox behavior of PeTI was firstly evaluated by generating a stable radical anion specie with the assistance of cobaltocene (CoCp2), and the structure of the electron transfer (ET) complex was confirmed by the X&#8208;ray crystallography. Moreover, due to the presence of multiple redox&#8208;active sites, we are able to show that the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art energy storage performance of the dealkylated PeTI (designated as PeTCTI) in organic potassium ion batteries (OPIBs) as an anode. Our results shed light on the application of multiple imides functionalized linear acenes, and the reported synthetic strategy provides an effective way to get access to longer nanoribbon imides with fascinating electronic properties.

Our results shed light on the application of multiple imides functionalized linear acenes, and the reported synthetic strategy provides an effective way to get access to longer nanoribbon imides with fascinating electronic properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The Molecular Architecture Laboratory of IIT Madras demonstrates the role of &#8220;Neighbouring Cage Participation&#8221; (NCP) in the construction of a family of pear&#8208;shaped low&#8208;symmetry double&#8208;cavity coordination cages. Combination of Pd(II) with a pair of isomeric ligands resulted in a low&#8208;hanging fruit i.e. a mixed&#8208;ligated syn&#8208;Pd3La2Lb2 type cage duly supported by orientational compatibility of the ligands. However, use of one type of the ligands resulted in loss of compatibility, yet forming stable though not low&#8208;hanging fruits due to NCP. In their Research Article (e202416332), Dillip K Chand et al. systematically investigate the aforementioned low&#8208;symmetry conjoined&#8208;cages.

We demonstrate a new C(sp3)&#8722;H acetylation methodology for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;substituted ketones that enables the construction of quaternary C centers via copper catalysis. A t&#8208;butoxy radical derived from tBuOOtBu engages in H&#8208;atom abstraction of an C(sp3)&#8722;H bond in substrates R&#8722;H to generate radicals R&#8226; captured by copper(II) enolates [CuII](CH2C(O)Ph) formed through acid&#8208;base exchange between [CuII]&#8722;OtBu intermediates and ketones CH3C(O)Ar to give &#945;&#8208;functionalized ketones R&#8722;CH2C(O)Ar.







Abstract

         <title>Paired Photoproduction of H2O2 and 3,4&#8208;Dihydroisoquinoline over Covalent Pyrene&#8208;(Thio)urea Frameworks with Electron Push&#8208;Pull Effect</title>

         <dc:description>Pairing photocatalytic 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroisoquinoline semi&#8208;dehydrogenation reaction (THIQ&#8208;SDR) with two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8208; ORR) is a green solar to chemical strategy by simultaneously utilizing the photo&#8208;excited electrons and holes. However, it is still short of high&#8208;efficiency photocatalyst to drive two reactions above. In the present work, crystalline pyrene&#8208;thiourea/urea covalent organic frameworks (COF&#8208;Py&#8208;S and &#8208;O) were synthesized and demonstrated as high&#8208;performance metal&#8208;free photocatalysts. In particular, COF&#8208;Py&#8208;S exhibited higher 2e&#8208; ORR to H2O2 yield rate of ~19 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 under visible light and finally solid H2O2 products (Na2CO3&#8226;1.5H2O2) was collected after long&#8208;time irradiation. Under natural sunlight conditions, the H2O2 production rate over COF&#8208;Py&#8208;S further increased to ~51 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, among the best organic photocatalysts. COF&#8208;Py&#8208;S also showed high THIQ&#8208;SDR conversion (~100%) with 3,4&#8208;dihydroisoquinoline (DHIQ) selectivity of ~92%. Theoretical calculations reveal stronger electron push&#8208;pull effect of COF&#8208;Py&#8208;S than COF&#8208;Py&#8208;O, enhancing its photoinduced charge carries, and a four&#8208;step 2e&#8208; ORR mechanism with thiourea as the active sites has been confirmed as well as the mechanism of THIQ&#8208;SDR to DHIQ, featuring lower energy barriers for O2 adsorption and *HOOH desorption over thiourea units. This work provides a paired photosynthesis strategy of H2O2 and DHIQ over high&#8208;efficiency pyrene&#8208;(thio)urea COF photocatalysts with electron push&#8208;pull effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing Zwitterionic Bottlebrush Polymers to Enable Long&#8208;Cycling Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zwitterionic bottlebrush&#8208;based ionogel polymer electrolytes are rationally designed to enhance Li+ transport with multifunctional capabilities, including dissociating [Li(anion)n]&#8722;(n&#8722;1) clusters, anchoring anions via cationic groups, and accelerating Li+ migration through anionic groups. The assembled Li metal batteries demonstrate ultralong&#8208;term reversible Li plating/stripping over 6500&#8197;h and unprecedented cycling stability over 2000&#8197;cycles with a superior capacity retention of 93.7&#8201;%.







Abstract
Ionogel polymer electrolyte (IPE), incorporating ionic liquid (IL) within a polymer matrix, presents a promising avenue for safe quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. However, sluggish Li+ kinetics, resulting from the formation of [Li(anion)n]&#8722;(n&#8722;1) clusters and the occupation of Li+ transport sites by organic cations, limit their practical applications. In this study, we have developed zwitterionic bottlebrush polymers&#8208;based IPE with promoted Li+ conduction by employing poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate)&#8208;grafted poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;chlorotrifluoroethylene) (PVC&#8208;g&#8208;PSBMA) bottlebrushes as matrices of IL. The grafted zwitterionic side chains greatly facilitate the dissociation of [Li(anion)n]&#8722;(n&#8722;1) clusters to produce more movable Li+. Moreover, the positively charged &#8722;NR4+ groups in zwitterionic side chains effectively restrain anions migration, while the negatively charged &#8722;SO3&#8722; groups immobilize IL cations, preventing them from occupying Li+ hopping sites and reducing the energy barrier for Li+ migration. These synergistic effects contribute to a notable ionic conductivity (7.5&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and Li+ transference number (0.62) of PVC&#8208;g&#8208;PSBMA IPE at 25&#8201;&#176;C. As a result, PVC&#8208;g&#8208;PSBMA IPE enables ultralong&#8208;term (over 6500&#8197;h) reversible and stable Li plating/stripping in Li||Li symmetric cells. Remarkably, the assembled Li||LiFePO4 full batteries demonstrate unprecedented cycling stability of more than 2000 cycles with a superior capacity retention of 93.7&#8201;%.

As a result, PVC-&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;-PSBMA IPE enables ultralong-term (over 6500&#8197;h) reversible and stable Li plating/stripping in Li||Li symmetric cells. Remarkably, the assembled Li||LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; full batteries demonstrate unprecedented cycling stability of more than 2000 cycles with a superior capacity retention of 93.7&#8201;%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sulfonated Hydroxyaryl&#8208;Tetrazines with Increased pKa for Accelerated Bioorthogonal Click&#8208;to&#8208;Release Reactions in Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new generation of sulfo&#8208;tetrazines for cellular click&#8208;to&#8208;release activations is described. These derivatives are easily accessible, stable, and achieve complete release of TCO&#8208;caged molecules within minutes. The introduced sulfo groups provide a versatile handle for modification, equipping the resulting sulfonamides with useful properties. These sulfo&#8208;tetrazines find applications in bioorthogonal prodrug and fluorophore activation.







Abstract
Bioorthogonal reactions that enable switching molecular functions by breaking chemical bonds have gained prominence, with the tetrazine&#8208;mediated cleavage of trans&#8208;cyclooctene caged compounds (click&#8208;to&#8208;release) being particularly noteworthy for its high versatility, biocompatibility, and fast reaction rates. Despite several recent advances, the development of highly reactive tetrazines enabling quantitative elimination from trans&#8208;cyclooctene linkers remains challenging. In this study, we present the synthesis and application of sulfo&#8208;tetrazines, a class of derivatives featuring phenolic hydroxyl groups with increased acidity constants (pKa). This unique property leads to accelerated elimination and complete release of the caged molecules within minutes. Moreover, the inclusion of sulfonate groups provides a valuable synthetic handle, enabling further derivatization into sulfonamides, modified with diverse substituents. Significantly, we demonstrate the utility of sulfo&#8208;tetrazines in efficiently activating fluorogenic compounds and prodrugs in living cells, offering exciting prospects for their application in bioorthogonal chemistry.

         <title>Efficient Direct Air Capture in Industrial Cooling Towers Mediated by Electrochemical CO2 Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel approach to direct air capture. Widespread industrial cooling towers are demonstrated to be effective for direct CO2 capture from air using a buffered absorbent solution. The captured CO2 can be efficiently released at high purity via electrolysis in a three&#8208;chamber electrolyzer operating at room temperature. The system exhibits stable performance over multiple cycles, highlighting its great potential for atmospheric CO2 removal.







Abstract
Direct air capture (DAC) is a promising technology for mitigating global climate change but suffers from low efficiency, small scale, and high cost due to the dilute atmospheric CO2, limited size of air contactors, and heat&#8208;driven CO2 release. Here, we propose combining DAC with widely used industrial cooling towers to extract CO2 from the air and using electrolysis to release the captured CO2 at room temperature. We first prepare a buffered absorbent solution consisting of sodium glycinate, glycine, and sodium chloride for effective CO2 capture from the air, solving the incompatibility problem of the cooling towers with conventional absorbents. Next, we employ a three&#8208;chamber electrolyzer for efficient release (&#8805;95&#8201;%) of the captured CO2 with high purity (&#8805;98&#8201;%) by constant current electrolysis at room temperature, bypassing the conventional energy&#8208;intensive heating process. The entire DAC system can operate stably for multiple cycles, and the mechanism for consecutive CO2 capture and release is uncovered. This work reveals the great potential of running DAC in industrial cooling towers coupled with electrochemically&#8208;driven CO2 release, opening up new avenues for curbing the increasingly severe climate change.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis and Applications of Stereogenic &#946;&#8242;&#8208;Methyl Enones and &#946;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;Dimethyl Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric monohydrogenation of readily available &#946;&#8242;&#8208;methylene enones has been realized with high efficiency and remarkable site&#8208;selectivity and enantioselectivity control for the practical and atom&#8208;economic construction of enantioenriched &#946;&#8242;&#8208;methyl enones that are difficult to access by other methods. This methodology is applicable for the preparation of chiral &#946;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl ketones through consecutive double asymmetric hydrogenation of &#946;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;dimethylene ketones. The synthetic utilities of this methodology have been well demonstrated in the concise synthesis of several key intermediates for biologically important chiral molecules, asymmetric total synthesis of natural products, and two spirocyclic diols.







Abstract
The &#8220;Magic Methyl&#8221; effect has received tremendous interest in medicinal chemistry due to the significant pharmacological and physical modification of properties that have been observed upon introducing a methyl group, especially, a stereogenic methyl group into potential chiral drug candidates. The prevalence of stereogenic &#946;&#8208;methyl ketone structural motifs in bioactive compounds and natural products has long motivated the development of enantioselective strategies toward their synthesis. Herein, we have rationally designed a Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric monohydrogenation of readily&#8208;available &#946;&#8242;&#8208;methylene conjugated enones with high efficiency and remarkable site&#8208;selectivity and enantioselectivity control for the practical construction of enantioenriched &#946;&#8242;&#8208;methyl unsaturated enones that are difficult to access by other methods. Control experiments revealed that the conjugated C=C bond in &#946;&#8242;&#8208;methylene conjugated enones plays a significant role in enhancing the reactivity of monohydrogenation. This methodology is applicable for the preparation of chiral &#946;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl ketones through consecutive double asymmetric hydrogenation of &#946;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;dimethylene ketones. Detailed mechanistic investigation and DFT studies further provided strong support for a unique processive catalysis pathway for double asymmetric hydrogenation. The synthetic utilities have been demonstrated in the concise synthesis of several key intermediates for bioactive molecules, asymmetric total synthesis of natural products (S)&#8208;(+)&#8208;ar&#8208;Turmerone and (S)&#8208;(+)&#8208;dihydro&#8208;ar&#8208;Turmerone, and two C2&#8208;symmetric chiral spirocyclic diol frameworks.

         <title>Topological and Morphological Membrane Dynamics in Giant Lipid Vesicles Driven by Monoolein Cubosomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monoolein cubosomes induce dynamic membrane transformations in giant lipid vesicles. Fusion of cubosomes into the lipid bilayer induces membrane growth and curvature stress. This drives morphological and topological effects such as tubulation, fission, fusion and intraluminal vesicles formation. This work has implications for applications in drug delivery and synthetic biology.







Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles have important applications as biomedical delivery platforms and broader engineering biology applications in artificial cell technologies. These emerging technologies often require changes in the shape and topology of biological or biomimetic membranes. Here we show that topologically&#8208;active lyotropic liquid crystal nanoparticles (LCNPs) can trigger such transformations in the membranes of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). Monoolein (MO) LCNPs, cubosomes with an internal nanostructure of space group

 incorporate into 1,2&#8208;dioleoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphocholine (DOPC) GUVs creating excess membrane area with stored curvature stress. Using time&#8208;resolved fluorescence confocal and lattice light sheet microscopy, we observe and characterise various life&#8208;like dynamic events in these GUVs, including growth, division, tubulation, membrane budding and fusion. Our results shed new light on the interactions of LCNPs with bilayer lipid membranes, providing insights relevant to how these nanoparticles might interact with cellular membranes during drug delivery and highlighting their potential as minimal triggers of topological transitions in artificial cells.

         <title>Operando Evolution of a Hybrid Metallic Alloy Interphase for Reversible Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An operando&#8208;evolved metallic alloy interphase is proposed to achieve all&#8208;round protection for Zn metal anodes. This interphase, consisting of AgxZny alloy and metallic In, synergistically facilitates the migration of zinc ions through the protective layer and induces their planar deposition. Consequently, the Zn@(Ag&#8722;In)||ZnVO full cells demonstrated an excellent capacity retention of 90.2&#8201;% over 10,000&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are widely acknowledged as viable future energy storage solutions, particularly for low&#8208;cost stationary applications. However, the interfacial instability of zinc anodes represents a major challenge to the commercial potential of Zn&#8208;ion systems, promoting an array of side reactions including spontaneous corrosion, hydrogen evolution, and dendrite growth that destabilize cell performance, lower Coulombic efficiency and ultimately lead to early cell failure. While other commercially relevant battery systems benefit from a spontaneously forming solid electrolyte interphase, no such layer forms in AZIBs. Herein, we have designed and engineered an operando evolved metallic alloy interphase for AZIBs. This interfacial layer is initially deposited in the form of a thin film of Ag and In, but develops in situ to become an intimate mix of an AgxZny alloy and metallic indium. Importantly, this dual&#8208;heterometallic layer acts to synergistically regulate the migration of zinc ions through the alloy interphase and enables the dense and planar deposition of Zn, simultaneously overcoming all major drivers of Zn anode degradation. Symmetric and full cells containing this modified metallic zinc anode exhibit stable electrochemical performance, offering high&#8208;capacity retention. Hence, this scalable approach represents a viable route towards the commercial utilization of this energy storage system.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Semiconductive AgBiS2 NC Inks toward High&#8208;Efficiency, Low&#8208;Cost and Environmental&#8208;Friendly Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We for the first time realize a low&#8208;cost, scalable and eco&#8208;friendly synthesis of semiconductive AgBiS2 NC inks. The solar cells based on these inks realizes efficiency of 9.32&#8201;%, which outperform the highest reported efficiency (9.17&#8201;%) based on the complexed ligand&#8208;exchanged methods.







Abstract
Silver bismuth sulfide nanocrystals (AgBiS2 NCs) embody a pioneering heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free photovoltaic material renowned for its ultrahigh absorption coefficient, offering promising opportunities for advancing the field of ultra&#8208;thin and biocompatible solar cells. Currently, the fabrication of AgBiS2 NC photovoltaic devices relies on hot&#8208;injection synthesis and subsequent tedious ligand exchange, leading to high production cost, complex processes and environmental pollution. Here, we developed a direct&#8208;synthesis (DS) method without ligand&#8208;exchange for AgBiS2 NC semiconductive inks, significantly simplifying the material preparation and device fabrication processes. The synthesis cost of AgBiS2 inks (17.0 $&#8197;g&#8722;1) is over an order of magnitude lower than the traditional method (203.5&#8211;275.2&#8197;$&#8197;g&#8722;1). Through optimizing synthesis and device structure, a champion power conversion efficiency of 9.32&#8201;% was achieved, aligning with the highest reported efficiency (9.17&#8201;%) based on ligand&#8208;exchanged methods. In addition, our DS&#8208;AgBiS2 inks show excellent storage stability for over ten months. More importantly, the life cycle assessment (LCA) indicates drastically reduced energy consumption as well as environmental and human health impact for our strategy. The low&#8208;cost and scalable synthesis approach for AgBiS2 NC semiconductive inks present a &#8220;greener&#8221; pathway for the commercial applications of NC optoelectronics.

         <title>A BOIMPY Dye Enables Multi&#8208;Photoinduced Electron Transfer Catalysis: Reaching Super&#8208;Reducing Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystals of a BOIMPY dianion made the exploration of a catalytic process that relies on consecutive multi&#8208;photoinduced electron transfer (multi&#8208;PET) possible. Irradiation of the dye molecule leads to an excited species that allows the reduction of strong carbon&#8208;halide bonds and arenes. The synthetic value is showcased by hydrodehalogenations, C&#8722;C, and C&#8722;P bond formations, and Birch&#8208;type reductions. Thorough mechanistic investigation is presented.







Abstract
An established concept to create radical intermediates is photoexcitation of a catalyst to a higher energy intermediate, subsequently leading to a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) with a reaction partner. The known concept of consecutive photoinduced electron transfer (con&#8208;PET) leads to catalytically active species even higher in energy by the uptake of two photons. Generally speaking, increased photon uptake leads to a more potent reductant. Here, we report the concept of multi&#8208;photoinduced electron transfer catalysis (&gt;2 photons), termed multi&#8208;PET, which is enabled by photoinduced one&#8208;electron reductions of an organic dye. Further irradiation of the doubly reduced species leads to a photoexcited dianionic super&#8208;reductant, which is more potent than Li metal &#8211; one of the strongest chemical reductants known. This multi&#8208;photon process which is enabled by 390&#8197;nm LEDs allows the cleavage of strong carbon&#8208;fluorine bonds and reduction of other halides even in very electron&#8208;rich substrates. The resulting radicals are quenched by hydrogen atoms or engaged in carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;phosphorus bond formations, highlighting the utility of multi&#8208;PET for organic chemistry. In addition, multi&#8208;PET enabled Birch&#8208;type reductions. Spectroscopic, chemical and computational investigations are presented to gain mechanistic insights.

         <title>Programmable Self&#8208;Assembly from Two&#8208;Dimensional Nanosheets to Spiral, Twisted and Branched Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembly is an ideal strategy for synthesizing hierarchical materials, but remains great challenges due to the multiple non&#8208;covalent interactions in the assembly process. Herein a programmable assembly strategy was proposed to customize assembled structure. The assembled structures were transformed from nanosheet structure to spiral, twisted and branched structures by controlling screw dislocation growth and epitaxial growth mechanisms.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of nanomaterials into hierarchical structure is of great interest to fabricate functional materials. However, programmable design of the assembled structures remains a great challenge. Herein, we reported a programmable self&#8208;assembly strategy to customize the assembled structure. The self&#8208;assembly strategy is designed to orderly transform the two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Ca ions assembled F127 nanosheets (Ca&#8208;F127 NSs) into spiral nanosheet structures (S&#8208;Ca&#8208;F127 NSs), branched nanosheet structures (B&#8208;Ca&#8208;F127 NSs), branched&#8208;spiral nanosheet structures (B&#8208;S&#8208;Ca&#8208;F127 NSs), and twisted&#8208;branched structures (T&#8208;Ca&#8208;F127 NBs). Wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (WAXS) and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) indicate that these different structures maintain the same orthorhombic phase and Ca&#8208;O octahedral coordination structure. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) in the double&#8208;tilt liquid nitrogen cooling holder identifies the Eshelby twist in the twisted structures, demonstrating the spiral structure are formed by screw dislocation growth. Cryo&#8208;electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;EM) proves the oriented epitaxial growth in the B&#8208;Ca&#8208;F127 NSs. Furthermore, the formation mechanisms of spiral structure and branched structure can be recombined to form complex hierarchical structures. The epitaxial growth along screw dislocation can lead to the formation of B&#8208;S&#8208;Ca&#8208;F127 NSs, while the twisted epitaxial growth in the screw dislocation can lead to the formation of T&#8208;Ca F127 NBs.

2D mesoporous Ni single atom catalysts in the N&#8208;doped carbon framework with a high density (~6.0&#8197;wt&#8201;%) and ~100&#8201;% accessibility are synthesized via a bottom&#8208;up interfacial assembly strategy, which deliver a high current density of 446&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with &gt;95&#8201;% CO selectivity in the electrochemical CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) has captivated widespread attentions, yet achieving the requisite efficiency, selectivity and stability for industrial applications poses a persistent challenge. Here, we report the synthesis of 2D mesoporous Ni single atom catalysts in N&#8208;doped carbon framework via a bottom&#8208;up interfacial assembly strategy. The 2D mesoporous Ni&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst showcases an ultrathin thickness (~6.7&#8197;nm) with well&#8208;distributed 5 to 40&#8197;nm&#8208;width mesopores in plane and a high surface area. As a result, the Ni single atom sites with a high density (~6.0&#8197;wt&#8201;%) are almost completely exposed and can be accessible, and the mass transfer can be greatly promoted even at high current densities. Thus, a high current density of 446&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with &gt;95&#8201;% CO selectivity in a flow cell can be obtained. Concurrently, the catalyst demonstrates an impressive stability, maintaining a 50&#8208;hours continuous electrolysis in the membrane electrode assembly test and achieving an energy efficiency of 42&#8201;%. Finite element analysis reveals that the 2D mesoporous design enhances CO2 diffusion, ensuring efficient adsorption and swift CO desorption at high current densities. Our study paves a way for the fabrication of 2D mesoporous single atom catalysts with nearly 100&#8201;% accessibility and expedited mass transport.

         <title>Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonds Weaken Interaction Between Solvents and Small Organic Molecules Towards Superior Lithium&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intramolecular hydrogen bonds strategy is first proposed to solve the dissolution issue of small organic cathode materials. This strategy is performed on the TPNQ molecule and is verified to be highly efficient in terms of suppressing dissolution and improving kinetics by redistributing molecular charge and weakening the interaction between the TPNQ molecule and solvents. Li//TPNQ batteries display excellent cycling stability.







Abstract
The strong interaction between organic electrode materials (OEMs) and electrolyte components induces a high solubility tendency of OEMs, thus hindering the practical application of lithium&#8208;organic batteries. Herein, we propose an efficient strategy for intramolecular hydrogen bonds (HBs) to redistribute the charge of OEMs to weaken the interaction with electrolyte components, thereby suppressing their dissolution. For the designed 2,2&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;trihydroxybenzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triyl) tris (1H&#8208;naphtho[2,3&#8208;d]imidazole&#8208;4,9&#8208;dione) (TPNQ) molecule, the intramolecular HBs (O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N and N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O) reduce the charge density of active sites and alter the charge distribution on the molecular skeleton. As a result, TPNQ shows significantly reduced solubility in both ether&#8208; and ester&#8208;based solvents. In situ measurements and theoretical calculations indicate that the O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N dominated HB interaction strengthening during the discharging process, which can continuously suppress dissolution. Therefore, the TPNQ cathode displays high cycling stability (no capacity fading over 100 cycles at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1; 88.4&#8201;% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), fast Li+&#8208;storage kinetics (211&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and surprising low&#8208;temperature performances (stability cycles 500 times at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C). Our results offer evidence that the intramolecular HBs strategy is promising in developing robust organic electrode materials for rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Stabilizing Hydrogen Radicals in Two&#8208;Dimensional Cobalt&#8208;Copper Mesoporous Nanoplates for Complete Nitrate Reduction Electrocatalysis to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional mesoporous CoCu nanoplates with confined microenvironment and alloyed composition were precisely designed for complete electrocatalysis of waster nitrate into value&#8208;added ammonia under a natural electrolyte. Thanks to unique physicochemical property, this electrocatalyst performed well with a lower energy consumption in the two&#8208;electrode coupling system, which concurrently electrosynthesized ammonia from nitrate at cathode and 2,5&#8208;furanedicarboxylic acid from 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural at anode.







Abstract
Ambient electrochemical reduction of waste nitrate (NO3&#8722;) represents an alternative green route for sustainable ammonia (NH3) electrosynthesis in water. Despites some encouraged achievements, sluggish eight electron and nine proton reduction routes that involve multi&#8208;step hydrogenation pathways have severely hindered their NH3 Faradaic efficiency (FENH3) and yield rate. Herein, we develop a robust two&#8208;dimensional mesoporous cobalt&#8208;copper (meso&#8208;CoCu) nanoplate electrocatalyst that delivers excellent performance of complete NO3&#8722; reduction reaction (NO3RR), including superior FENH3 of 98.8&#8201;%, high NH3 yield rate of 3.39&#8197;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 and energy efficiency of 49.8&#8201;%, and good cycling stability. Mechanism investigations unveil that active hydrogen (*H) radicals produced from water splitting on Co sites spillover to adjacent Cu sites and further stabilize within confined mesopores, which kinetically promote its coupling hydrogenation reactions of nitrogen intermediates and thus facilitate complete NO3RR for favorable NH3 electrosynthesis. Moreover, meso&#8208;CoCu nanoplates perform well as a bifunctional electrocatalyst in the two&#8208;electrode coupling system that concurrently synthesizes NH3 from NO3&#8722; at cathode and 2,5&#8208;furanedicarboxylic acid from 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural at anode. This work in stabilizing *H radicals in mesoporous microenvironment provides some insights applied to various hydrogenation reactions for selective electrosynthesis of high value&#8208;added chemicals in water.

         <title>Regulating Peripheral Nitrogen Dopants in Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts to Enhance Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides atomic insights into the peripheral doping states, which are relevant not only to the thermodynamics but also to the kinetics of the propane dehydrogenation reaction occurring at the single&#8208;atom center. The combined theoretical and experimental results show that increasing the nitrogen dopant in farther shells can not only enhance the activity of the Ir1 site but also maintain a high selectivity for propene.







Abstract
For single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), the dopants situated near the metal site have demonstrated a significant impact on the catalytic properties. However, the effect of dopants situated further away from the metal centers and their working mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Herein, we conduct density functional theory&#8208;driven studies on regulating the peripheral nitrogen dopants in graphene&#8208;based SACs, with a particular focus on Ir1 SAC, for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). It is found that increasing the distance between the N dopant and the Ir1 site results in a different energy change for the reaction process compared to the dense doping models with only first and second&#8208;shell N species. The proposed stochastic doping models demonstrate statistically that increasing the N dopant in farther shells not only enhances the activity of Ir1 but also maintains a high selectivity for propene, which is verified by experimental tests. The modulation of the d&#8208;band center of Ir1 by stochastic N dopants effectively modifies the binding strength of reaction intermediates, thereby enabling the optimization of the potential energy surface of PDH. These results deepen the understanding of dopant states around metal sites and provide an important implication for the doping engineering in heterogeneous catalysis.

It is found that increasing the distance between the N dopant and the Ir&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; site results in a different energy change for the reaction process compared to the dense doping models with only first and second-shell N species. The proposed stochastic doping models demonstrate statistically that increasing the N dopant in farther shells not only enhances the activity of Ir&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; but also maintains a high selectivity for propene, which is verified by experimental tests. The modulation of the &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-band center of Ir&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; by stochastic N dopants effectively modifies the binding strength of reaction intermediates, thereby enabling the optimization of the potential energy surface of PDH. These results deepen the understanding of dopant states around metal sites and provide an important implication for the doping engineering in heterogeneous catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The title compound exhibits a cooperative spin&#8208;transition with an unusual asymmetric hysteresis. It crystallizes as a mixture of two high&#8208;spin polymorphs HS1 and HS2, which convert simultaneously to the low&#8208;spin phases LS3 and LS4 on cooling. The HS1 and LS3 fractions increase at the expense of HS2 and LS4 upon repeated scanning, which reflects that HS2 converts to a mixture of LS3 and LS4 on cooling, and LS4 to HS1 and HS2 on rewarming.







Abstract
Polycrystalline [FeL2][BF4]2 (L=2,6&#8208;di(pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)isonicotinonitrile) exhibits an abrupt hysteretic spin transition near 240&#8197;K, with a shoulder on the warming branch whose appearance depends on the sample history. The freshly isolated material is a ca 60&#8201;:&#8201;40 mixture of triclinic (HS1) and tetragonal (HS2) high&#8208;spin polymorphs, which are structurally closely related. Both HS1 and HS2 undergo a high&#8594;low&#8208;spin transition on cooling at 230&#177;10&#8197;K. HS1 transforms to a new triclinic low&#8208;spin phase with a doubled unit cell volume (LS3), while HS2 forms a monoclinic low&#8208;spin phase (LS4) with similar unit cell dimensions to HS2. Single crystals of LS3 and LS4 both convert to HS1 on rewarming. The low&#8594;high&#8208;spin transition for LS4 is ca 10&#8197;K higher in temperature than for LS3, explaining the asymmetric thermal hysteresis. Powder diffraction, calorimetry and magnetic data show that multiple cycling about the spin&#8208;transition leads to slow enrichment of the HS1 and LS3 phases at the expense of HS2 and LS4. That is consistent with the HS2/LS4 fraction of the polycrystalline sample undergoing rare, bifurcated HS2&#8594;(LS3+LS4) and LS4&#8594;(HS1+HS2) phase transitions. The rate of enrichment of HS1/LS3 differed between these experiments, implying it is sample and/or measurement&#8208;dependent. Three other salts of this iron(II) complex and the coordination polymer [Ag(&#956;&#8208;L)]BF4 are also briefly described.

         <title>Formamidinium Incorporates into Rb&#8208;based Non&#8208;Perovskite Phases in Solar Cell Formulations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We determine the speciation in mechanosynthesized formamidinium (FA+) and rubidium (Rb+)&#8208;containing lead&#8208;halide perovskite formulations by NMR. We discover that a secondary non&#8208;perovskite Rb&#8208;based phase incorporates up to 60&#8201;% formamidinium.







Abstract
Organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite materials, such as formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3), are among the most promising emerging photovoltaic materials. However, the spontaneous phase transition from the photoactive perovskite phase to an inactive non&#8208;perovskite phase complicates the application of FAPbI3 in solar cells. To remedy this, alkali metal cations, most often Cs+, Rb+ or K+, are included during perovskite synthesis to stabilize the photoactive phase. The atomic&#8208;level mechanisms of stabilization are complex. While Cs+ dopes directly into the perovskite lattice, Rb+ does not, but instead forms an additional non&#8208;perovskite phase, and the mechanism by which Rb confers increased stability remains unclear. Here, we use 1H&#8722;87Rb double resonance NMR experiments to show that FA+ incorporates into the Rb&#8208;based non&#8208;perovskite phases (FAyRb1&#8208;yPb2Br5 and &#948;&#8208;FAyRb1&#8208;yPbI3) for both bromide and iodide perovskite formulations. This is demonstrated by changes in the 1H and 87Rb chemical shifts, 1H&#8722;87Rb heteronuclear correlation spectra, and 87Rb{1H} REDOR spectra. Simulation of the REDOR dephasing curves suggests up to ~60&#8201;% FA+ incorporation into the inorganic Rb&#8208;based phase for the bromide system. In light of these results, we hypothesize that the substitution of FA+ into the non&#8208;perovskite phase may contribute to the greater stability conferred by Rb salts in the synthesis of FA&#8208;based perovskites.

         <title>Electrolyte Reconfiguration by Cation/Anion Cross&#8208;coordination for Highly Reversible and Facile Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrolyte reconfiguration strategy realizes the cross&#8208;coordination solvation structure to access highly reversible and facile sodium storage by optimizing the interfacial chemistry and de&#8208;solvation process in a broad range of &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C to 25&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Hard carbon (HC) materials are promising anodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) owing to low cost, high specific capacity and low working potential. However, the poor compatibility of the electrolyte with HC leads to low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) and sluggish Na+ transport kinetics. Here, we propose an electrolyte reconfiguration strategy based on the hard and soft acid and base (HSAB) theory by introducing methyltriphenylphosphonium bromide (MTPPB). MTPPB can realize a spontaneous cross&#8208;coordination solvation structure with NaPF6 by selective affinity, synchronously optimizing the interfacial chemistry and sodium storage process. The advantages of the chemical &#960;&#8211;&#960; bridging of MTPP+&#8208;HC and interaction of MTPP+&#8208;PF6&#8722; contribute to preferential and oriented reduction of PF6&#8722;, forming a low&#8208;resistance supramolecular SEI. Additionally, Na+&#8208;Br&#8722; coordination weakens the Na+&#8208;solvent interactions, facilitating Na+ de&#8208;solvation kinetics. Consequently, the HC||Na cell achieves a superior ICE of 96.6&#8201;%, desirable rate capability under 25&#8201;&#176;C and invisible capacity decay after 500 cycles at 1&#8197;C under &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. The Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7||HC pouch battery displays a high ICE of 90.3&#8201;% and a 15&#8201;% increment of energy density under 25&#8201;&#176;C. This work provides a guidance through electrolyte reconfiguration engineering for designing practical HC&#8208;based SIBs with high energy/power density and long&#8208;life span in the extended operating&#8208;temperature range.

         <title>Combining Simple Deformations to Elicit Complex Motions and Directed Swimming of Smart Organic Crystals with Controllable Thickness</title>

We report a water&#8208;assisted precipitation method to prepare crystals with various thicknesses that respond to ultraviolet light with simple mechanical effects, including bending, splintering, and rotation. The resulting crystal&#8208;based robots exhibit motions reminiscent of sailing and humanoid movements.







Abstract
The lack of control over the crystal growth in a systematic way currently stands as an unsurmountable impediment to the preparation of dynamic crystals as soft robots; in effect, the mechanical effects of molecular crystals have become a subject of scattered reports that pertain only to specific crystal sizes and actuation conditions, often without the ability to establish or confirm systematic trends. One of the factors that prevents the verification of such performance is the unavailability of strategies for effectively controlling crystal size and aspect ratio, where crystals of serendipitous size are harvested from crystallization solution. Here we devised a water&#8208;assisted precipitation method to prepare crystals of chemical variants of 9&#8208;anthracene derivatives with various thicknesses that respond to ultraviolet light with simple mechanical effects, including bending, splintering, and rotation. By capitalizing on the robust mechanical flexibility and deformability of crystals, we demonstrate systematic variations in crystal deformation that are further elevated in complexity to construct crystal&#8208;based robots capable of controllable motions reminiscent of sailing and humanoid movements. The results illustrate an approach to eliminate one of the critical obstacles towards complete control over the motility of dynamic molecular crystals as microrobots in non&#8208;aerial environments.

         <title>Hydrothermal Stability of Active Sites in Cu&#8208;Exchanged Small&#8208;Pore Zeolites for the Selective Catalytic Reduction of NOx</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four distinct Cu species co&#8208;exist in Cu&#8208;CHA and Cu&#8208;AEI zeolites under NH3&#8208;SCR conditions: solvated Cu1+ and Cu2+ cations, framework&#8208;coordinated Cu1+ cations, and framework&#8208;coordinated CuIIst species&#8212;formed explicitly during hydrothermal ageing. After hydrothermal treatment, ~28&#8201;% of Cu in Cu&#8208;AEI, while ~46&#8201;% of Cu in Cu&#8208;CHA was converted to inactive CuIIst. The better hydrothermal stability of Cu in the AEI is attributed to its tortuous channel structure that hinders the migration of hydrated Cu2+ cations.







Abstract
Combining operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and computational modelling shows unequivocally the distribution of active species in fresh and hydrothermally aged Cu&#8208;CHA and Cu&#8208;AEI zeolites during NH3&#8208;assisted selective catalytic reduction of NOx. Four principal species co&#8208;exist: (i) CuI cations coordinated to NH3, (ii) CuI cations coordinated to the zeolite framework, (iii) solvated CuII cations, and (iv) framework&#8208;coordinated CuII species (CuIIst) formed upon hydrothermal ageing of the zeolite sample. The CuIIst species were only observed in the hydrothermally aged zeolite samples and are formed upon the interaction of hydrated CuII cations with extra&#8208;framework Al (EFAl) generated during the hydrothermal treatment. These sites are inactive for NOx reduction, leading to a decrease in the catalytic performance of the hydrothermally aged zeolites. CuIIst formation was higher in Cu&#8208;CHA (~46&#8201;%) than in Cu&#8208;AEI (~28&#8201;%). The better hydrothermal stability of Cu in the AEI framework is attributed to the tortuous channel structure of AEI that hinders the migration of hydrated CuII cations during hydrothermal ageing.

         <title>On the Origin of Capacity Increase in Rechargeable Magnesium Batteries with Manganese Oxide Cathodes and Copper Metal Current Collectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The capacity increase mechanism in rechargeable magnesium batteries featuring Cu metal is investigated through multiscale joint operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray characterizations. These analyses unveil that the capacity enhancement stems from the progressive electrochemical corrosion of metallic Cu. This corrosion initiates irreversible depletion of both the Cu current collector and magnesium metal, ultimately resulting in cell failure.







Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs), with Cu as positive electrode current collector (CC), typically display a gradual capacity increase with cycling. Whereas the origin of this was suggested in gradual active material electro&#8208;activation, the fact that this is prevalent in many positive electrode material systems remains unexplained. Herein, we elucidate the underlying mechanism through a series of multiscale joint operando X&#8208;ray characterizations, including operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and imaging technology. We select a series of manganese oxides as benchmark positive electrodes and find that no magnesium ions are stored within the lattices of these materials, despite an apparent cell capacity increase with cycling. The origin of capacity increase is rooted in the gradual electrochemical corrosion of metallic Cu, release of Cu(I, II) species in electrolyte, and their subsequent redox activity, resulting in apparent electrode capacity gains. Furthermore, the shuttle and redox speciation of Cu ions trigger the irreversible depletion of both the Cu CC (or any other source) and the magnesium metal, ultimately leading to cell failure. Our work suggests the need to reconsider the appropriateness of using Cu as a positive electrode CC for RMBs.

         <title>Integrated Monomer Synthesis and Framework Assembly: Achieving Isoreticular Modulation of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes an integrated monomer synthesis&#8208;framework assembly (ISA) approach, where organic monomers are synthesized and simultaneously assembled into hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks under consistent solvent conditions, resulting in the successful creation of a series of isoreticular (6,3)&#8208;net hcb topological hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks with tunable pore sizes and microenvironment.







Abstract
Systematic construction of isoreticular hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) promises tailored material properties crucial for diverse applications, yet is challenging due to the weak, flexible, and non&#8208;directional nature of hydrogen bonds. Herein, we develop an &#8220;integrated monomer synthesis&#8208;framework assembly&#8221; (ISA) methodology for constructing a series of isoreticular HOFs. Unlike traditional methods where monomers are first synthesized and then assembled into HOFs, the ISA system employs dicyandiamide rigid hydrogen&#8208;bonded hexameric clusters as connecting nodes to covalently react with planarized C3&#8208;symmetric cyano&#8208;precursors (C3&#8208;CPs) to generate diaminotriazine (DAT) monomers, while simultaneously inducing the directional assembly into isoreticular (6,3)&#8208;net hcb topological DAT&#8208;C6&#8208;HOFs. The pore sizes and microenvironments of the resulting DAT&#8208;C6&#8208;HOFs can be precisely tuned by varying the structural modulation (length and steric hindrance) of the &#960;&#8208;bridge on C3&#8208;CPs, enabling highly selective sensing towards perfluorooctanoic acid over other homologous molecules, that are difficult to be separated and detected by chromatography. Overall, the ISA methodology facilitates the scalable creation of families of isostructural HOFs and provides a customized structural platform for investigating factors beyond topology that impact the capturing, releasing, and responding to guest molecules.

Type 3 (coupled binuclear) copper systems reduce dioxygen for transport, substrate oxygenation, and electron transfer across aerobic life. Using synthetic models with protic histidine environments, we find that the histidine&#8208;stabilized copper centers become not just one&#8208;electron but also two&#8208;electron shuttles&#8212;they isomerize to copper(III) when deprotonated by a base.







Abstract
Imidazole ligation of metals through histidine is extensive among metalloproteins, yet the role of the imidazolate conjugate base is often neglected, despite its potential accessibility when bonded to an oxidized metal center. Using synthetic models of oxygenated tyrosinase enzymes ligated exclusively by monodentate imidazoles, we find that deprotonation of the &#956;2&#8208;&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;peroxidodicopper(II) species triggers redox isomerization to an imidazolate&#8208;ligated bis(&#956;2&#8208;oxido)dicopper(III) species. Formal two&#8208;electron oxidation to Cu(III) remains biologically unprecedented, yet is effected readily by addition of base. Spectrophotometric titrations by UV/Visible/near&#8208;IR and copper K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopies are interpreted most simply as two cooperative, 2H+ transformations in which the peroxide O&#8722;O is cleaved in the first step. Elaboration from simple imidazoles to a protected histidine extends this isomerization into an amino acid environment. The role of phenolate as a base suggests this four&#8208;electron reduction of O2 is energetically viable in a biological context and requires only two copper centers, which act as two&#8208;electron shuttles when imidazole deprotonation assists. This existential precedent of viable imidazolate intermediates invites speculation into an alternative mechanism for phenol hydroxylation not previously considered at Type 3 copper sites such as tyrosinases. Structural biological evidence suggests imidazolate ligation of copper may be more widespread than generally understood.

         <title>Pyrolysis&#8208;Free Synthesis of Synergistic Single&#8208;Atom/Nanocluster Electrocatalysts for Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pyrolysis&#8208;free synthetic strategy is developed to integrate single atoms and nanoclusters towards highly satisfactory catalytic performances for both acidic and alkaline hydrogen electrocatalysis. The as&#8208;prepared catalysts with hybrid single atom/nanocluster sites exhibited superior catalytic activities for hydrogen evolution in both acidic and alkaline media with low over&#8208;potentials at &#8722;10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 of 25&#8197;mV and 8.6&#8197;mV.







Abstract
Constructing catalysts that simultaneously contain single atom/metal nanocluster active sites is a promising strategy to enhance the original catalytic behavior and accelerate the catalysis involving multi&#8208;electron reactions or multi&#8208;intermediates. Herein, the pyrolysis&#8208;free synthetic method is developed to integrate single atoms and nanoclusters towards highly satisfactory catalytic performances for both acidic and alkaline hydrogen electrocatalysis. The controllable pyrolysis&#8208;free strategy allows the precise modulation of the active centers, realizing the optimization of the adsorption energy and the regulation of the synergistic active components. Specially, the as&#8208;prepared catalysts with hybrid single&#8208;atom/nanocluster sites exhibited superior catalytic activities for hydrogen evolution in both acidic and alkaline media with low over&#8208;potentials at &#8722;10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 of 25&#8197;mV and 8.6&#8197;mV, respectively, combining with outstanding durability towards high current density and methanol poisoning. This work developed a universal synthetic strategy for the single atom/nanocluster synergy systems and addressed the superiority of hybrid single&#8208;atom/nanocluster sites.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Oxidized Tr&#246;ger's Base Macrocyclic Arenes: Unprecedented Enantioselective Recognition in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;soluble enantiomeric nitrogen&#8208;oxidized Tr&#246;ger's base macrocyclic arenes were synthesized. These rigid, electron&#8208;deficient cavities exhibit excellent chiral discrimination for a wide range of guests, achieving a record&#8208;breaking enantioselectivity of 41.







Abstract
Achieving high enantioselectivity with synthetic receptors, particularly in water, remains a significant challenge despite the success seen in natural biological systems. In this study, we introduce a facile synthesis of Tr&#246;ger's base (TB)&#8208;containing macrocyclic arenes (TBn), where TB units are linked via methylene bridges, providing the macrocycles with a rigid framework. Oxidation of enantiopure TBn yields corresponding chiral nitrogen oxides (TBnNO) with excellent water solubility, attributed to the high polarity of the N&#8722;O bond, surpassing the pH limitations of traditional ion&#8208;functionalized approaches. Remarkably, TBnNO exhibits exceptional enantioselective recognition toward a wide range of chiral guests in aqueous solution, achieving enantioselectivities as high as 41.0. The underlying mechanism involves a combination of hydrophobic interactions and steric effects caused by rigid chiral cavities. These findings highlight the potential of nitrogen&#8208;oxidized macrocycles as a transformative tool for supramolecular application in water.

         <title>A New Class of Oxyhalide Solid Electrolytes NaNbCl6&#8208;2xOx for Solid&#8208;state Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries are gaining traction due to the high abundance and lower cost compared to lithium, along with the safety advantages of solid&#8208;state batteries. A new class of sodium&#8208;based oxyhalide electrolytes NaNbCl6&#8208;2xOx, synthesized with both Nb2O5 and NbCl3O via a simple mechanochemical reaction is presented. NaNbCl4O exhibits nearly two orders of magnitude higher sodium&#8208;ion conductivity (1.03&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) than NaNbCl6 (3&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1).







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;based batteries are gaining momentum due to the abundance and lower cost of sodium compared to lithium. Solid&#8208;state sodium batteries can also provide further safety advantages. However, sodium&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) that meet all the rigorous requirements, such as high ionic conductivity, oxidative stability with the cathode, and ease of processability, are lacking. We present here a new class of sodium&#8208;based oxyhalide electrolytes NaNbCl6&#8208;2xOx with a facile mechanochemical synthesis. The oxyhalide NaNbCl4O exhibits close to two orders of magnitude higher ambient&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;ion conductivity (1.03&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) compared to the halide counterpart NaNbCl6 (3&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1). Structural motifs unique to the oxygen content in NaNbCl6&#8208;2xOx are identified with 23Na and 93Nb magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) spectroscopy and x&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD). Solid&#8208;state sodium batteries assembled with NaNbCl4O electrolyte and the cobalt&#8208; and nickel&#8208;free layered Na0.70Fe0.3Mn0.65Al0.05O2 cathode exhibit a maximum discharge capacity of 155&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with good cycle life at ambient temperature.

A DNA framework&#8208;based spherical nucleic acid (tDF&#8208;SNA) with a dynamic, spiky interface is developed to improve siRNA delivery efficiency. This system largely enhances siRNA duplex efficiency, promotes cellular uptake, and facilitates cytoplasmic access. Consequently, tDF&#8208;SNA effectively delivers siRNA into the cytoplasm, leading to increased gene silencing efficacy.







Abstract
Spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) hold substantial therapeutic potential for the delivery of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Nevertheless, their potential remains largely untapped due to the challenges of cytosolic delivery. Inspired by the dynamic, spiky architecture of coronavirus, an interface engineering approach based on a tetrahedral DNA framework (tDF) is demonstrated for the development of coronavirus&#8208;mimicking SNAs. By exploiting their robustness and precise construction, tDFs are evenly arranged on the surface of core nanoparticles (NPs) with flexible conformations, generating a dynamic, spiky architecture. This spiky architecture in tetrahedral DNA framework&#8208;based SNAs (tDF&#8208;SNAs) substantially improve siRNAs duplex efficiency from 20&#8201;% to 95&#8201;%. Meanwhile, tDF&#8208;SNAs changed the endocytosis pathway to clathrin&#8208;independent cellular engulfment pathway and enhanced the cellular uptake efficiency. Due to these advances, the delivery efficiency of siRNA molecules by tDF&#8208;SNAs is 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude higher than that of SNAs, resulting in a 2&#8208;fold increase in gene silencing efficacy. These results show promise in the development of bioinspired siRNAs delivery systems for intracellular applications.

         <title>Excitation&#8208;Dependent Anti&#8208;Thermal Quenching in Zero&#8208;Dimensional Manganese Bromides for Photoluminescence and X&#8208;Ray Scintillation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid manganese bromides exhibit switchable thermal quenching (TQ) and anti&#8208;thermal quenching (anti&#8208;TQ) behaviors, which strongly depend on excitation wavelength. For example, TQ behavior can be observed when they are excited at the peak and shoulders (direct excitation) of photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectrum while they exhibit undoubtedly anti&#8208;TQ behavior when excited at the valley (indirect excitation) of PLE or under X&#8208;ray irradiation from room temperature to ~400&#8197;K. These phenomena are proven to originate from the relative change of shortest Mn&#8722;Mn distance and efficient Mn&#8208;ligand distance, which regulates the competition between radiative and nonradiative recombination rates.







Abstract
One of the most significant challenges of luminescent materials is the thermal quenching (TQ) at high temperature. Understanding the correlation between crystal structure variation and photoluminescence (PL) quenching is significant to achieve anti&#8208;thermal quenching (anti&#8208;TQ) phosphors. Herein, we unveil a universal principle governing switchable TQ and anti&#8208;TQ behaviors in zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid manganese bromides. We observed an abnormal anti&#8208;TQ phenomenon when phosphor is excited in the valley of PL excitation (PLE) spectrum (indirect excitation) while TQ phenomenon is observed when excited in the peak and shoulder positions of PLE. Our findings demonstrate that PL intensity is influenced by two variable parameters: the effective Mn&#8208;ligand distance and the shortest Mn&#8722;Mn distance. These excitation&#8208;dependent TQ and anti&#8208;TQ behaviors originate from the relative changes in these distances, which modulate the competition between radiative and nonradiative recombination rates, as evidenced at the molecular level by molecular dynamics simulation. X&#8208;ray activated radioluminescence (RL) also exhibits anti&#8208;TQ behavior, which is analogous to the indirect excitation of PL evolution when excited at PLE valley. These insights bridge the gap between PL and RL properties in 0D manganese halides and offer potential avenues for developing advanced anti&#8208;TQ phosphors, efficient LEDs, and high&#8208;performance scintillators.

         <title>Nanoparticle Transport in Proximal Tubules with Rhabdomyolysis&#8208;Induced Necrosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Renal&#8208;clearable gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) exhibited enhanced kidney accumulation in a rhabdomyolysis&#8208;induced acute kidney injury mouse model. By distinguishing the injury stages of necrotic proximal tubules (PTs) through histopathological characteristics, we found that the enhanced kidney accumulation was due to selective retention of the AuNPs in the extracellular lumen of late&#8208;stage necrotic PTs as a result of lumen obstruction by cell debris.







Abstract
Renal&#8208;clearable engineered nanoparticles are being explored for their potential to deliver therapeutic agents for kidney disease treatment. A fundamental understanding of how these nanoparticles accumulate in diseased kidneys at the cellular level is essential to enhance their effectiveness and minimize side effects on adjacent healthy tissues. Herein, we report that the accumulation of glutathione&#8208;coated, near&#8208;infrared emitting gold nanoparticles (GS&#8208;AuNPs) correlates strongly with the necrotic stages of injured proximal tubular cells. Using a rhabdomyolysis&#8208;induced acute kidney injury (AKI) mouse model, we observed that GS&#8208;AuNPs were significantly accumulated in the extracellular lumen of proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) at advanced necrotic stage, where cellular debris and released intracellular contents impeded their clearance. In contrast, during early necrosis, GS&#8208;AuNPs were still cleared through the unobstructed lumen. Additionally, intracellular uptake of GS&#8208;AuNPs was significantly reduced across all necrotic stages. These findings underscore the need for new strategies to design nanoparticles that can effectively target and be taken up by the diseased tubular cells before extensive necrosis occurs; so that nanoparticle&#8208;mediated drug delivery for kidney disease treatment can be achieved with desired efficacy and precision.

         <title>Bifunctional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Synergistically Enhances Radiotherapy and Activates STING for Potent Cancer Radio&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional nanoscale metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), MOF/MSA&#8208;2, leverages high&#8208;Z Hf6 secondary building units for radioenhancement and releases MSA&#8208;2 for sustained STING activation to mediate the regression of colon tumors in mice. Further combination with immune checkpoint blockade effectively suppresses both primary and distant tumors through systemic immune activation.







Abstract
The activation of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) protein by cyclic dinucleotide metabolites plays a critical role in antitumor immunity. However, synthetic STING agonists like 4&#8208;(5,6&#8208;dimethoxybenzo[b]thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;4&#8208;oxobutanoic acid (MSA&#8208;2) exhibit suboptimal pharmacokinetics and fail to sustain STING activation in tumors for effective antitumor responses. Here, we report the design of MOF/MSA&#8208;2, a bifunctional MSA&#8208;2 conjugated nanoscale metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) based on Hf6 secondary building units (SBUs) and hexakis(4&#8242;&#8208;carboxy[1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl)benzene bridging ligands, for potent cancer radio&#8208;immunotherapy. By leveraging the high&#8208;Z properties of the Hf6 SBUs, the MOF enhances the therapeutic effect of X&#8208;ray radiation and elicits potent immune stimulation in the tumor microenvironment. MOF/MSA&#8208;2 further enhances radiotherapeutic effects of X&#8208;rays by enabling sustained STING activation and promoting the infiltration and activation of immune cells in the tumors. MOF/MSA&#8208;2 plus low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation elicits strong STING activation and potent tumor regression, and when combined with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, effectively suppresses both primary and distant tumors through systemic immune activation.

         <title>Natural Polyphenol&#8208;Reinforced Ion&#8208;Selective Separators for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries with High Sulfur Loading and Lean Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural polyphenol&#8208;reinforced ion&#8208;selective separators are prepared by spontaneous deposition of green tea&#8208;derived polyphenols onto a polypropylene separator. The high electronegativity and strong lithiophilicity of these phenolic compounds ensure superior ion&#8208;selectivity, effectively repelling soluble intermediate anions while facilitating rapid Li ion transport. Thus, the lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries display superior cycling stability and rate performance under challenging conditions.







Abstract
Ion&#8208;selective separators are promising to inhibit soluble intermediates shuttle in practical lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries. However, designing and fabricating such high&#8208;performance ion&#8208;selective separators using cost&#8208;effective, eco&#8208;friendly, and versatile methods remains a formidable challenge. Here we present ion&#8208;selective separators fabricated via the spontaneous deposition of green tea&#8208;derived polyphenols onto a polypropylene separator, aimed at enhancing the stability of Li&#8722;S batteries. The resulting natural polyphenol&#8208;reinforced ion&#8208;selective (NPRIS24) separators exhibit rapid Li ion transport and high soluble intermediates inhibition capability with an ultralow shuttle rate of 0.67&#8201;% for Li2S4, 0.19&#8201;% for Li2S6 and 0.10&#8201;% for Li2S8. This superior ion&#8208;selectivity arises from the high electronegativity and strong lithiophilic nature of the phenolic compounds. Consequently, we have achieved high&#8208;performance Li&#8722;S batteries that are steadily cyclable under the challenging conditions of an S loading of 5.7&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, an electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;S ratio of 5.1&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1, and a 50&#8197;&#956;m Li foil anode. Furthermore, the NPRIS24 separator enhances the performance of other Li metal batteries utilizing commercial LiFePO4 (5.3&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (9.9&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) cathodes.

     alt="Natural Polyphenol-Reinforced Ion-Selective Separators for High-Performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries with High Sulfur Loading and Lean Electrolyte"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural polyphenol-reinforced ion-selective separators are prepared by spontaneous deposition of green tea-derived polyphenols onto a polypropylene separator. The high electronegativity and strong lithiophilicity of these phenolic compounds ensure superior ion-selectivity, effectively repelling soluble intermediate anions while facilitating rapid Li ion transport. Thus, the lithium-sulfur batteries display superior cycling stability and rate performance under challenging conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ion-selective separators are promising to inhibit soluble intermediates shuttle in practical lithium-sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries. However, designing and fabricating such high-performance ion-selective separators using cost-effective, eco-friendly, and versatile methods remains a formidable challenge. Here we present ion-selective separators fabricated via the spontaneous deposition of green tea-derived polyphenols onto a polypropylene separator, aimed at enhancing the stability of Li&#8722;S batteries. The resulting natural polyphenol-reinforced ion-selective (NPRIS24) separators exhibit rapid Li ion transport and high soluble intermediates inhibition capability with an ultralow shuttle rate of 0.67&#8201;% for Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, 0.19&#8201;% for Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and 0.10&#8201;% for Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;. This superior ion-selectivity arises from the high electronegativity and strong lithiophilic nature of the phenolic compounds. Consequently, we have achieved high-performance Li&#8722;S batteries that are steadily cyclable under the challenging conditions of an S loading of 5.7&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, an electrolyte-to-S ratio of 5.1&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and a 50&#8197;&#956;m Li foil anode. Furthermore, the NPRIS24 separator enhances the performance of other Li metal batteries utilizing commercial LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (5.3&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (9.9&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) cathodes.

         <title>Enhancing Microdomain Consistency in Polymer Electrolytes towards Sustainable Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>

A polymer electrolyte with hyperdispersed MOF fillers is strategically designed for tackling the chronic issue of uneven mechanical/ionic/electric field distribution, and unstable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces. The enhanced microdomain consistency of the electrolyte facilitate fast and homogenized Li flux, which results in smooth and stabilized Li growth.







Abstract
Polymer electrolytes incorporated with fillers possess immense potential for constructing the fast and selective Li+ conduction. However, the inhomogeneous distribution of the fillers usually deteriorates the microdomain consistency of the electrolytes, resulting in uneven Li+ flux, and unstable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces. Herein, we formulate a solution&#8208;process chemistry to in situ construct gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) with well&#8208;dispersed metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), leading to a uniform microdomain structure. Through the integration of X&#8208;ray computed tomography analyses and theoretical simulations, our research identifies that the improvement of microdomain consistency in GPEs is beneficial for enhancing its mechanical strength, homogenizing ionic/electronic field distribution and upgrading the interface stability with the elctrodes. Moreover, consistently spread MOFs bind effectively with Lewis&#8208;base anions of Li salts, enhancing Li+ kinetics. Owing to these advantages, the developed GPEs achieve a high conductivity of 1.51&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a Li+ transference number of 0.66, resulting in exceptional cyclability of lithium metal electrodes (over 1800&#8197;hours). Additionally, the solid&#8208;state NCM811//Li pouch batteries exhibit an impressive capacity retention of 94.2&#8201;% over 200&#8197;cycles with an N/P ratio of 1.69. This study emphasizes the significant impact of microdomain structural chemistry on the advancement of solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Fuel&#8208;Driven &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Superstructures to Form Transient Conductive Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical reaction cycles applied to &#960;&#8208;conjugated superstructures enable the formation of transient hydrogels whose electrical conductivity is encoded by the consumption of chemical fuels.







Abstract
Despite advances in creating dissipative materials with transient properties, such as hydrogels and active droplets, their application remains confined to temporal changes in structural properties. Developing out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium materials whose electronic functions are parameterized by a chemical reaction cycle is challenging. Yet, this class of materials is required to construct biomimetic materials. In contrast to traditional chemical reaction cycles that exploit molecularly dissolved building blocks at thermodynamic equilibrium, we show that fiber structures derived from reactive naphthalene diimide (NDI) building blocks can be used as resting states to form far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium conductive hydrogels after the addition of chemical fuels. Upon fueling the NDI&#8208;derived fibers, a dual&#8208;component activation and deactivation pathway is deduced by kinetic analysis and is absent when using a molecularly dissolved resting state. Investigating the solid&#8208;state morphologies of the structures formed throughout the fuel&#8208;driven reaction cycle using cryo&#8208;EM reveals that the resting thermodynamic fibers evolve to transient thicker fibrils and layered superstructures. We show that the transient redox&#8208;active hydrogels exhibit a nearly threefold increase in electrical conductivity upon fuel consumption before reverting to their original value over hours. These far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium materials are potential candidates in applications such as programmable biorobotics and chemical computing.

         <title>Synchronous Modulation of H&#8208;bond Interaction and Steric Hindrance via Bio&#8208;molecular Additive Screening in Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>

Bio&#8208;molecular additive screening strategy for ZnSO4 electrolyte is featured by H&#8208;bond re&#8208;organization and carrier transport hindrance at the electrode interface, thereby decreasing water activity and homogenizing Zn deposition toward durable Zn batteries.







Abstract
In addressing challenges such as side reaction and dendrite formation, electrolyte modification with bio&#8208;molecule sugar species has emerged as a promising avenue for Zn anode stabilization. Nevertheless, considering the structural variability of sugar, a comprehensive screening strategy is meaningful yet remains elusive. Herein, we report the usage of sugar additives as a representative of bio&#8208;molecules to develop a screening descriptor based on the modulation of the hydrogen bond component and electron transfer kinetics. It is found that xylo&#8208;oligosaccharide (Xos) with the highest H&#8208;bond acceptor ratio enables efficient water binding, affording stable Zn/electrolyte interphase to alleviate hydrogen evolution. Meanwhile, sluggish reduction originated from the steric hindrance of Xos contributes to optimized Zn deposition. With such a selected additive in hand, the Zn||ZnVO full cells demonstrate durable operation. This study is anticipated to provide a rational guidance in sugar additive selection for aqueous Zn batteries.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Maleimide&#8208;Based Dual Functionalization of Protein N&#8208;Termini</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Maleimides can target the N&#8208;termini of proteins instead of cysteine by the use of 2&#8208;pyridinecarboxaldehyde and copper(II) salt under non&#8208;denaturing conditions. The methodology requires no mutagenesis of proteins and enables the high&#8208;yield attachment of various functional groups to proteins with various N&#8208;terminal amino acids through a simple operation using commercially available maleimides.







Abstract
Maleimide derivatives are privileged reagents for chemically modifying proteins through the Michael addition reaction with cysteine due to their selectivity, operational simplicity, and commercial availability. However, since accessible free cysteine is rarely found in natural proteins, it is highly desirable to find alternative targets to enable direct bioconjugation of proteins with maleimides. In this study, we have developed an operationally simple and straightforward method for the N&#8208;terminal modification of proteins without the need for mutagenesis via a copper(II)&#8208;mediated [3+2] cycloaddition reaction with maleimides and 2&#8208;pyridinecarboxaldehyde (2&#8208;PCA) derivatives under non&#8208;denaturing conditions at pH&#8197;6 and 37&#8201;&#176;C in aqueous media. Our method utilizes commercially available maleimides to attach diverse functionalities to various N&#8208;terminal amino acids. We demonstrate the preparation of a ternary protein complex cross&#8208;linked at the N&#8208;termini and dually modified trastuzumab equipped with monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), a cytotoxic agent, and a Cy5 fluorophore (MMAE&#8208;Cy5&#8208;trastuzumab). MMAE&#8208;Cy5&#8208;trastuzumab retained human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) recognition activity and exerted cytotoxicity against HER2&#8208;positive cells. Furthermore, MMAE&#8208;Cy5&#8208;trastuzumab allowed successful visualization of HER2&#8208;positive cancer cells in mouse tumors. This straightforward method will expand the accessibility of protein conjugates with well&#8208;defined structures in a wide range of research fields.

We demonstrate the preparation of a ternary protein complex cross-linked at the N-termini and dually modified trastuzumab equipped with monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), a cytotoxic agent, and a Cy5 fluorophore (MMAE-Cy5-trastuzumab). MMAE-Cy5-trastuzumab retained human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) recognition activity and exerted cytotoxicity against HER2-positive cells. Furthermore, MMAE-Cy5-trastuzumab allowed successful visualization of HER2-positive cancer cells in mouse tumors. This straightforward method will expand the accessibility of protein conjugates with well-defined structures in a wide range of research fields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pore Structure Modulation in Kirigamic Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensional kirigami mechanics of a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) in the solid state are demonstrated through mechanical and molecular stimuli. By controlling these external stimuli, the molecular framework of the ZIF undergoes significant changes, with up to a 37&#8201;% alteration in unit&#8208;cell parameters. This unique folding behavior also leads to programmable pore structures in this channel&#8208;type ZIF, functioning similarly to check valve&#8208;adapted mechanical manifolds to regulate fluid flow.







Abstract
Paper crafts, such as origami and kirigami, have become an interdisciplinary research theme transportable from art to science, and further to engineering. Kirigami&#8208;inspired architectural design strategies allow the establishment of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) mechanical linkages with unprecedented mechanical properties. Herein, we report a crystalline zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF), displaying folding mechanics based on a kirigami tessellation, originated from the double&#8208;corrugation surface (DCS) pattern. Pressure&#8208; and guest&#8208;induced responses demonstrate the kirigami mechanism of the ZIF, wherein imidazolate linkers act as hinges, controlling pore dimensionality, resembling the check valve&#8208;adapted mechanical manifold. This discovery of the kirigami tessellation inside a flexible ZIF reveals foldable mechanics at the molecular level.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Allylic Nitriles via Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetric Cyanation of Biaryl Diallylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric allylic cyanation of biaryl allylic alcohols for the synthesis of axially chiral nitriles in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 90&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;% ee). This process enables the synthesis of a diverse range of axially chiral allylic nitriles bearing &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated alcohol moieties. Leveraging the allylic alcohol and cyano groups as versatile functionalization handles allow for further derivatization of these axially chiral frameworks.







Abstract
Axially chiral nitriles are common motifs in organic photoelectric materials, biological compounds, and agrochemicals. Unfortunately, the limited synthetic approaches to axially chiral nitriles have impeded their availability. Herein, we report the first nickel&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric allylic cyanation of biaryl allylic alcohols for the synthesis of axially chiral nitrile structures in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 90&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;% ee). This process enables the synthesis of a diverse range of axially chiral allylic nitriles bearing &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated alcohol moieties. Leveraging the allylic alcohol and cyano groups as versatile functionalization handles allow for further derivatization of these axially chiral frameworks. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that both steric and electronic interactions play crucial roles in determining the enantioselectivity of this transformation. Moreover, this mild and facile protocol is also applicable for gram&#8208;scale preparation of the chiral nitriles.

         <title>Direct Epitaxial Growth of Polycrystalline MOF Membranes on Cu Foils for Uniform Li Deposition in Long&#8208;life Anode&#8208;free Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The binder&#8208;free MOF polycrystalline membrane based on HKUST&#8208;1 was constructed on the surface of Cu foil by epitaxial growth strategy. During the initial Li+ deposition process, Li+ ions will combine with HKUST&#8208;1 to form a Li&#8208;rich HKUST&#8208;1 membrane. This behaviour substantially reduces overpotential, improves the quality of deposited Li, inhibits dendrite growth and ensures the long&#8208;term stable cycling of battery.







Abstract
Anode&#8208;free Li&#8208;metal battery (AFLMB) is being developed as the next generation of advanced energy storage devices. However, the low plating and stripping reversibility of Li on Cu foil prevents its widespread application. A promising avenue for further improvement is to enhance the lithophilicity of Cu foils and optimise their surfaces through a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) functional layer. However, excessive binder usage in the current approaches obscures the active plane of the MOF, severely limiting its performance. In response to this challenge, MOF polycrystalline membrane technology has been integrated into the field of AFLMB in this work. The dense and seamless HKUST&#8208;1 polycrystalline membrane was deposited on Cu foil (HKUST&#8208;1&#8197;M@Cu) via an epitaxial growth strategy. In contrast to traditional MOF functional layers, this binder&#8208;free polycrystalline membrane fully exposes lithophilic sites, effectively reducing the nucleation overpotential and optimising the deposition quality of Li. Consequently, the Li plating layer becomes denser, eliminating the effects of dendrites. When coupled with LiFePO4 cathodes, the battery based on the HKUST&#8208;1 membrane exhibits excellent rate performance and cycling stability, achieving a high reversible capacity of approximately 160&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and maintaining a capacity retention of 80.9&#8201;% after 1100 cycles.

         <title>Stabilization of the Compressed Planar Benzene Dianion in Inverse&#8208;Sandwich Rare Earth Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>

The first inverse sandwich complexes [{(Me3Si)2NC(NiPr)2}2RE]2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;6&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;6&#8208;C6H6) with RE = trivalent yttrium, dysprosium, and erbium, are presented, which exhibit a completely planar antiaromatic benzene bridging dianion ligand. The remarkable planarity of the bridging parent benzene dianion is otherwise unknown with any s&#8208;, p&#8208;, d&#8208;, or 4f&#8208; metal, and rationalized by the match of the metals d&#8208;manifold with the &#960;*&#8208;molecular orbital of the bridging benzene unit and strong electrostatically compression through coordination with the two cationic REIII sites.







Abstract
For the first time, the capture of the planar antiaromatic parent benzene dianion in between two trivalent rare earth (RE) metal cations (REIII), each stabilized by two guanidinate ligands, is reported. The synthesized inverse&#8208;sandwich complexes [{(Me3Si)2NC(NiPr)2}2RE]2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;6&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;6&#8208;C6H6), (RE=Y (1), Dy (2), and Er (3)) were crystallized from aprotic solvents and feature a remarkably planar parent benzene dianion, previously not encountered for any metal ion prone to low or absent covalency. The &#8722;2 charge localization at the benzene ligand was deduced from the results obtained by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses, spectroscopy, magnetometry, and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. In the 1H NMR spectrum of the diamagnetic Y complex 1, the equivalent proton resonance of the bridging benzene dianion ligand is drastically shifted to higher field in comparison to free benzene. This and the calculated highly positive Nucleus&#8208;Independent Chemical Shift (NICS) values are attributed to the antiaromatic character of the benzene dianion ligand. The crucial role of the ancillary guanidinate ligand scaffold in stabilizing the planar benzene dianion conformation was also elucidated by DFT calculations. Remarkably, the planarity of the benzene dianion originates from the stabilization of the &#960;&#8208;type orbitals of the d&#8208;manifold and compression through its strong electrostatic interaction with the two REIII sites.

The crucial role of the ancillary guanidinate ligand scaffold in stabilizing the planar benzene dianion conformation was also elucidated by DFT calculations. Remarkably, the planarity of the benzene dianion originates from the stabilization of the &#960;-type orbitals of the d-manifold and compression through its strong electrostatic interaction with the two RE&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; sites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Suppressing Energy Migration via Antiparallel Spin Alignment in One&#8208;Dimensional Mn2+ Halide Magnets with High Luminescence Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The antiparallel spin alignment along the Mn2+ chain could effectively suppress the energy migration and multiphonon relaxation, resulting in a low nonradiative transition rate and a high photoluminescence quantum yield.







Abstract
Photoexcited energy migration is prone to causing luminescence quenching in Mn2+ luminescent materials, presenting a formidable challenge for optoelectronic applications. Although various strategies and mechanisms have been proposed to mitigate this issue, the role of spin alignment between adjacent Mn2+ ions has remained largely unexamined. In this study, we have elucidated the influence of spin alignment on energy migration within the one&#8208;dimensional Mn2+&#8208;metal halide compound (CH3)4NMnCl3 (TMMC) through variable&#8208;temperature photoluminescence (PL) and magnetic&#8208;optical spectroscopy. This investigation was conducted with reference to (CH6N3)2MnCl4 (GUA) with isolated [Mn3Cl12]6&#8722; trimers and Cd2+&#8208;doped TMMC. The spin order in TMMC below approximately 55&#8197;K is demonstrated by the disorder&#8208;order transition observed in the temperature&#8208;dependent magnetic susceptibility. This finding is further corroborated by the negligible shift in the temperature&#8208; and field&#8208;dependent emission peaks, a consequence of magnetic saturation. Our results indicate that the antiparallel spin alignment along the Mn2+ chain in TMMC effectively suppresses energy migration and multiphonon relaxation, thereby reducing nonradiative transitions and enhancing the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). This research casts new light on the potential for developing high&#8208;performance Mn2+&#8208;doped phosphors for optoelectronic and spin&#8208;photonic applications, offering insights into the manipulation of spin and energy dynamics in these materials.

         <title>Rebuilding Peripheral F, Cl, Br Footprints on Acceptors Enables Binary Organic Photovoltaic Efficiency Exceeding 19.7&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By delicately rebuilding peripheral F, Cl, Br footprints, the central brominated acceptor of CH&#8722;B afforded the first&#8208;class efficiency of 19.78&#8201;% for binary organic solar cells, also achieved the best performance when further increasing active layer thickness to ~300&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Given homomorphic fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl) and bromine (Br) atoms are featured with gradually enlarged polarizability/atomic radius but decreased electronegativity, the rational screen of halogen species and locations on small molecular acceptors (SMAs) is quite essential for acquiring desirable molecular packing to boost efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, three isomeric SMAs (CH&#8722;F, CH&#8722;C and CH&#8722;B) are constructed by delicately rebuilding peripheral F, Cl, Br footprints on both central and end units. Such a re&#8208;permutation of peripheral halogens could not only maintain the structural symmetry of SMAs to the maximum, but also acquire extra asymmetric benefits of enhanced dipole moment and intramolecular charge transfer, etc. Moreover, central brominating enhances molecular crystallinity of CH&#8722;B without introducing undesirable steric hindrance on end groups, thus rendering a better balance between high crystallization and domain size control in PM6:CH&#8722;B blend. Further benefitting from the large dielectric constant, small exciton binding energy, optimized molecular packing and great electron transfer integral, CH&#8722;B affords the first class binary OSC efficiency of 19.78&#8201;%, moreover, the highest efficiency of 18.35&#8201;% thus far when increasing active layer thickness to ~300&#8197;nm. Our successful screening in rebuilding peripheral halogen footprints provides the valuable insight into further rational design of SMAs for record&#8208;breaking OSCs.

         <title>Pre&#8208;Defined Stem&#8208;Loop Structure Library for the Discovery of L&#8208;RNA Aptamers that Target RNA G&#8208;Quadruplexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We combine mirror&#8208;image SELEX with a pre&#8208;structured library for the first time, using a pre&#8208;defined stem&#8208;loop (SL) structure library to develop the G4&#8208;SLSELEX&#8208;Seq platform. G4&#8208;SLSELEX&#8208;Seq can serve as a general L&#8208;RNA aptamer SELEX platform for RNA G&#8208;quadruplex (rG4) targets. L&#8208;Apt1&#8208;12 for the EBNA1 rG4 is selected in three rounds (within a week). It can effectively inhibit EBNA1 mRNA translation in Epstein&#8211;Barr virus (EBV)&#8208;positive cancer cells.







Abstract
L&#8208;RNA aptamers have been developed to target G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) and regulate G4&#8208;mediated gene expression. However, the aptamer selection process is laborious and challenging, and aptamer identification is subject to high failure rates. By analyzing the previously reported G4&#8208;binding L&#8208;RNA aptamers, we found that the stem&#8208;loop (SL) structure is favored by G4 binding. Herein, we present a robust and effective G4&#8208;SLSELEX&#8208;Seq platform specifically for G4 targets by introducing a pre&#8208;defined stem&#8208;loop structure library during the SELEX process. Using G4&#8208;SLSELEX&#8208;Seq, we identified an L&#8208;RNA aptamer, L&#8208;Apt1&#8208;12, for the Epstein&#8211;Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) RNA G4 (rG4) in just three selection rounds. L&#8208;Apt1&#8208;12 maintained the stem&#8208;loop structure initially introduced, and possessed a unique G&#8208;triplex motif that is important for the strong binding affinity and specificity to EBNA1 rG4. L&#8208;Apt1&#8208;12 effectively downregulated endogenous EBNA1 protein expression in human cancer cells and showed selective toxicity towards Epstein&#8211;Barr virus (EBV)&#8208;positive cancer cells, highlighting its potential for targeted therapy against EBV&#8208;associated cancers. Furthermore, we demonstrated the robustness and generality of G4&#8208;SLSELEX&#8208;Seq by selecting L&#8208;RNA aptamers for the amyloid precursor protein (APP) rG4 and the hepatitis C virus subtype 1a (HCV&#8208;1a) rG4, obtaining high&#8208;affinity aptamers in three selection rounds. These findings demonstrated G4&#8208;SLSELEX&#8208;Seq as a robust and efficient platform for the selection of rG4&#8208;targeting L&#8208;RNA aptamers.

         <title>Electrothermal Conversion of Methane to Methanol at Room Temperature with Phosphotungstic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through an electro&#8208;thermal process, methane is aerobically oxidized to methanol at room temperature using phosphotungstic acid (PTA) as a redox mediator. This system does not require the noble metals or hazardous reaction mixtures. This study demonstrates reduced polyoxotungstate as a viable platform to integrate thermo&#8208; and electrochemical methane oxidation at room temperature.







Abstract
Traditional methods for the aerobic oxidation of methane to methanol frequently require the use of noble metal catalysts or flammable H2&#8208;O2 mixtures. While electrochemical methods enhance safety and may avoid the use of noble metals, these processes suffer from low yields due to limited current density and/or low selectivity. Here, we design an electrothermal process to conduct aerobic oxidation of methane to methanol at room temperature using phosphotungstic acid (PTA) as a redox mediator. When electrochemically reduced, PTA activates methane with O2 to produce methanol selectively. The optimum productivity reaches 29.45 

&#956;molgPTA-1h-1

 ${\mu mol\ {g}_{PTA}^{-1}{h}^{-1}}$



 with approximately 20.3&#8201;% overall electron yield. Under continuous operation, we achieved 19.90 

&#956;molgPTA-1h-1

 ${\mu mol\ {g}_{PTA}^{-1}{h}^{-1}}$



 catalytic activity, over 74.3&#8201;% methanol selectivity, and 10&#8197;hours durability. This approach leverages reduced PTA to initiate thermal catalysis in solution phase, addressing slow methane oxidation kinetics and preventing overoxidations on electrode surfaces. The current density towards methanol production increased over 40 times compared with direct electrochemical processes. The in situ generated hydroxyl radical, from the reaction of reduced PTA and oxygen, plays an important role in the methane conversion. This study demonstrates reduced polyoxotungstate as a viable platform to integrate thermo&#8208; and electrochemical methane oxidation at ambient conditions.

When electrochemically reduced, PTA activates methane with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to produce methanol selectively. The optimum productivity reaches 29.45

 ${\mu mol\ {g}_{PTA}^{-1}{h}^{-1}}$


 with approximately 20.3&#8201;% overall electron yield. Under continuous operation, we achieved 19.90 
&#956;molgPTA-1h-1

 ${\mu mol\ {g}_{PTA}^{-1}{h}^{-1}}$


 catalytic activity, over 74.3&#8201;% methanol selectivity, and 10&#8197;hours durability. This approach leverages reduced PTA to initiate thermal catalysis in solution phase, addressing slow methane oxidation kinetics and preventing overoxidations on electrode surfaces. The current density towards methanol production increased over 40 times compared with direct electrochemical processes. The in situ generated hydroxyl radical, from the reaction of reduced PTA and oxygen, plays an important role in the methane conversion. This study demonstrates reduced polyoxotungstate as a viable platform to integrate thermo- and electrochemical methane oxidation at ambient conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interfacial Proton Precompensation: Suppressing Deprotonation&#8208;Driven Lattice Collapse for Enhanced Efficiency and Stability in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the surface energy state of the SnO2 buried interface was modulated by proton precompensation treatment, which can inhibit the proton transfer behavior guided by proton affinity and enhance the stability of perovskite crystal, achieving efficient perovskite solar cells with significantly improved photothermal stability.







Abstract
The chemical property of the buried interface plays a crucial role in improving the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The SnO2/perovskite interface prepared from SnO2 alkaline hydrogel with high proton affinity triggers directional migration and irreversible reactions of protons, exacerbating the disintegration of perovskite crystal. In this study, we proposed proton precompensation strategy to suppress the deprotonation effect of the buried interface and improve the durability of the devices. By modulating the chemical environment and surface energy state of the buried interface, the domain&#8208;limiting and spontaneous compensation of protons in formamidinium (FA+) under coulomb force were achieved, thereby stabilizing the perovskite crystal structure. The stability of target perovskite films under UV illumination and heating at 85&#8201;&#176;C was significantly enhanced. As a result, the devices can retain around 90&#8201;% of their initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) after 1000&#8197;h of continuous irradiation at the maximum power point (MPP). Moreover, due to the reduction of defect content at the buried interface and the improvement of conductivity and carrier mobility by the precompensation treatment, the interfacial energy loss and non&#8208;radiative recombination were substantially diminished. The target PSC devices exhibited much higher PCE of 25.55&#8201;% than the control devices (23.03&#8201;%).

         <title>Corannulene&#8208;Based Quintuple [6]/[7]Helicenes: Well&#8208;Preserved Bowl Core, Inhibited Bowl Inversion and Supramolecular Assembly with Fullerenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quintuple [6]helicenes with Q[6]H&#8208;1 and Q[6]H&#8208;2 conformers, along with [7]helicene Q[7]H, were synthesized by directly hybridizing corannulene and quintuple helicene. Q[6]H&#8208;2 adopts a propeller&#8208;shaped conformation with a well&#8208;preserved corannulene core, enabling it to recognize fullerenes. Furthermore, the subtle conformational variations of Q[6]H lead to significant changes in its chiral stability and bowl inversions.







Abstract
Herein, corannulene&#8208;based quintuple [6]helicenes (Q[6]H&#8208;1 and Q[6]H&#8208;2) and [7]helicene (Q[7]H) were synthesized via penta&#8208;fold Heck and Mallory reaction. Notably, Q[7]H represents the highest reported helicene based on corannulene. X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals that Q[6]H&#8208;2 adopts a propeller&#8208;shaped conformation with a well&#8208;preserved corannulene core, while Q[6]H&#8208;1 and Q[7]H exhibit quasi&#8208;propeller&#8208;shaped conformations. Upon heating, conformer Q[6]H&#8208;1 undergoes conversion to the thermodynamically more stable conformer Q[6]H&#8208;2, whereas conformer Q[7]H remains unchanged due to larger steric congestion. Racemization of the enantiomer of Q[6]H&#8208;1 and conformational conversion were observed simultaneously at elevated temperature, with DFT studies indicating a racemization barrier of 32.06&#8197;kcal&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1. In contrast, the racemization barrier for Q[6]H&#8208;2 was calculated to be 45.46&#8197;kcal&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1, indicating exceptional chiral stability. Surprisingly, the bowl inversions of Q[6]H&#8208;1 and Q[6]H&#8208;2 conformers are somewhat inhibited by the helical blades, whereas this was not observed for other possible conformers of Q[6]H. These results first demonstrated that subtle conformational variations can lead to significant changes in chiral stability and bowl inversions of multiple helicenes. Due to the well&#8208;preserved corannulene core, propeller&#8208;shaped conformation and electron complementarity, Q[6]H&#8208;2 can recognize fullerenes in both solution and solid state, which is a rare instance of co&#8208;crystallization assembly between multiple helicenes and fullerenes.

         <title>A Kinetic Scout Approach Accelerates Targeted Protein Degrader Development</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we implement lysine&#8208;targeted reversible&#8208;covalent chemistry to rationally tune the binding kinetics of targeted protein degraders at the protein&#8208;of&#8208;interest across 25 targets. Our key finding is that target residence time is a major determinant of degrader activity, and the synthesis of a minimal number of kinetic scouting analogues can accelerate degrader development.







Abstract
Bifunctional molecules such as targeted protein degraders induce proximity to promote gain&#8208;of&#8208;function pharmacology. These powerful approaches have gained broad traction across academia and the pharmaceutical industry, leading to an intensive focus on strategies that can accelerate their identification and optimization. We and others have previously used chemical proteomics to map degradable target space, and these datasets have been used to develop and train multiparameter models to extend degradability predictions across the proteome. In this study, we now turn our attention to develop generalizable chemistry strategies to accelerate the development of new bifunctional degraders. We implement lysine&#8208;targeted reversible&#8208;covalent chemistry to rationally tune the binding kinetics at the protein&#8208;of&#8208;interest across a set of 25 targets. We define an unbiased workflow consisting of global proteomics analysis, IP/MS of ternary complexes and the E&#8208;STUB assay, to mechanistically characterize the effects of ligand residence time on targeted protein degradation and formulate hypotheses about the rate&#8208;limiting step of degradation for each target. Our key finding is that target residence time is a major determinant of degrader activity, and this can be rapidly and rationally tuned through the synthesis of a minimal number of analogues to accelerate early degrader discovery and optimization.

         <title>Unveiling Surface Reconstruction as the Primary Trigger for Capacity Loss in Ultra&#8208;High Nickel Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanical and structural degradation of ultra&#8208;high Ni cathodes with different structures was systematically studied. contrary to the traditional view, structural and electrochemical characterizations of the cycled cathodes demonstrate that intragranular cracks, intergranular cracks, and nanopores are not the primary contributing factors of capacity loss. Instead, surface reconstruction (i.e., chemical decay) triggers rapid capacity decay.







Abstract
Mechanical failures, such as cracks and nanopores, along with the associated surface reconstruction, have long been regarded as the primary causes of capacity decay in ultra&#8208;high Ni layered oxides. However, the impact of these failures on performance degradation has not yet been effectively elucidate and distinguished. Herein, we develop ultra&#8208;high Ni cathodes with tailored morphological structures by incorporating B and Mo to optimize lithiation kinetics, which can suppress lattice strain, particle cracking, and surface reconstruction during charging/discharging. And the role of chemo&#8208;mechanical failures in capacity loss is systematically investigated. Surprisingly, contrary to the traditional view, structural and electrochemical characterizations of the cycled cathodes demonstrate that intragranular cracks, intergranular cracks, and nanopores are not the primary contributing factors of capacity loss. Instead, surface reconstruction triggers rapid capacity decay. Notably, compared to nanopores, intragranular cracks expose a significantly larger quantity of active substances, thereby promoting interfacial side reactions and accelerating surface structural reconstruction during cycling.

Herein, we develop ultra-high Ni cathodes with tailored morphological structures by incorporating B and Mo to optimize lithiation kinetics, which can suppress lattice strain, particle cracking, and surface reconstruction during charging/discharging. And the role of chemo-mechanical failures in capacity loss is systematically investigated. Surprisingly, contrary to the traditional view, structural and electrochemical characterizations of the cycled cathodes demonstrate that intragranular cracks, intergranular cracks, and nanopores are not the primary contributing factors of capacity loss. Instead, surface reconstruction triggers rapid capacity decay. Notably, compared to nanopores, intragranular cracks expose a significantly larger quantity of active substances, thereby promoting interfacial side reactions and accelerating surface structural reconstruction during cycling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Nonenzymatic Formation of Biologically Common RNA Hairpins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Template&#8208;free RNA loop&#8208;closing ligation selectively generates RNA tetraloops that are prevalent in biology, as demonstrated by high&#8208;throughput sequencing. Utilizing high&#8208;yield overhang sequences enables the efficient assembly of functional RNAs.







Abstract
The prebiotic formation of RNA building blocks is well&#8208;supported experimentally, yet the emergence of sequence&#8208; and structure&#8208;specific RNA oligomers is generally attributed to biological selection via Darwinian evolution rather than prebiotic chemical selectivity. In this study, we used deep sequencing to investigate the partitioning of randomized RNA overhangs into ligated products by either splinted ligation or loop&#8208;closing ligation. Comprehensive sequence&#8208;reactivity profiles revealed that loop&#8208;closing ligation preferentially yields hairpin structures with loop sequences UNNG, CNNG, and GNNA (where N represents A, C, G, or U) under competing conditions. In contrast, splinted ligation products tended to be GC rich. Notably, the overhang sequences that preferentially partition to loop&#8208;closing ligation significantly overlap with the most common biological tetraloops, whereas the overhangs favoring splinted ligation exhibit an inverse correlation with biological tetraloops. Applying these sequence rules enables the high&#8208;efficiency assembly of functional ribozymes from short RNAs without template inhibition. Our findings suggest that the RNA tetraloop structures that are common in biology may have been predisposed and prevalent in the prebiotic pool of RNAs, prior to the advent of Darwinian evolution. We suggest that the one&#8208;step prebiotic chemical process of loop&#8208;closing ligation could have favored the emergence of the first RNA functions.

         <title>Novel Inorganic&#8208;Organic Dual&#8208;Photosensitizing Dinuclear&#8208;Metal Self&#8208;Assembly System for Efficient Artificial Photosynthesis without Sacrificial Electron Donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We employed covalent&#8208;linking and electrostatic&#8208;driven approaches to construct a novel inorganic&#8208;organic dual&#8208;photosensitizing dinuclear metal molecular catalyst, i.e., PVK@[Py&#8208;Co2L]. In photocatalytic reactions, this self&#8208;assembly hybrid not only optimized the charge transfer between inorganic PS and molecular catalysts, but also boosted the development of artificial photocatalysis without sacrificial electron donors.







Abstract
Owing to the unique synergistic effect, dinuclear&#8208;metal&#8208;molecule&#8208;catalysts (DMCs) show excellent performance in catalytic fields. However, for overall photocatalytic CO2 reaction (CO2RR), it is still a challenge to construct well&#8208;matched photosensitizer (PS) components for DMCs&#8208;based photocatalysts. Inorganic&#8208;quantum&#8208;dot PS possesses capacities of multiple exciton generation and catalyzing water oxidation but is incompatible with DMCs. In contrast, organic PS can be covalently linked with DMCs but inescapable of using sacrificial electron donors. For overall photocatalytic CO2RR, organic&#8211;inorganic dual&#8208;photosensitizing system might be a promising candidate. Herein, we employed covalent&#8208;linking and electrostatic&#8208;driven approaches to construct the self&#8208;assembly of pyrene&#8208;sensitized Co2L DMCs (Py&#8208;Co2L) and perovskite (PVK) quantum dots, i.e., PVK@[Py&#8208;Co2L]. Using H2O as an electron donor, PVK@[Py&#8208;Co2L] realized 105.24&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8901;h&#8722;1 CO yield in photocatalytic CO2RR, much higher than PVK (15.44&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8901;h&#8722;1) and PVK@Co2L (32.30&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1), ascribing to the efficient photogenerated charge separation and transfer. The experimental results and theoretical investigations demonstrated that the pyrene linked on Co2L boosted the electron delivery from PVK to DMCs. Besides, this strategy could also be extended to the photocatalytic H2 evolution coupled with alcohol oxidation. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, our work lightens the integration of DMCs, organic and inorganic PS components, promoting the development of photocatalysis without sacrificial electron donors.

         <title>Engineering Single Ni Sites on 3D Cage&#8208;like Cucurbit[n]uril Ligands for Efficient and Selective CO2 Photocatalytic Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel molecular co&#8208;catalyst (CB[7]&#8208;Ni) is designed with a 3D Cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) cage&#8208;like ligand to accommodate atomically dispersed nickel centers for photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO. It achieves a CO yield rate of 72.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 with 97.9&#8201;% selectivity under visible light irradiation. The homogeneous nature of this co&#8208;catalyst enables efficient charge transfer from photosensitizer to the Ni2+ active site, reducing nearby CO2 molecules enriched by the unique CB[7] cage.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven CO2 selective reduction with high conversion is a challenging task yet holds immense promise for both CO2 neutralization and green fuel production. Enhancing CO2 adsorption at the catalytic centre can trigger a highly efficient CO2 capture&#8208;to&#8208;conversion process. Herein, we introduce cucurbit[n]urils (CB[n]), a new family of molecular ligands, as a key component in the creation of a 3D cage&#8208;like metal (nickel, Ni)&#8208;complex molecular co&#8208;catalyst (CB[7]&#8208;Ni) for photocatalysis. It exhibits an unprecedented CO yield rate of 72.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a high selectivity of 97.9&#8201;% under visible light irradiation. To verify the origin of the carbon source in the products, a straightforward isotopic tracing method is designed based on tandem reactions. The catalytic process commences with photoelectron transfer from Ru(bpy)32+ to the Ni2+ site, resulting in the reduction of Ni2+ to Ni+. The locally enriched CO2 molecules in the cage ligand CB[7] undergo selective reduction by the Ni+ nearby to form CO product. This work exemplifies the inspiring potential of ligand structure engineering in advancing the development of efficient unanchored molecular co&#8208;catalysts.

         <title>Nickel Dynamics Switches the Selectivity of CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface dynamics is the key to explain the product distribution of CO2 hydrogenation on Ni. Density Functional Theory combined with microkinetic simulations shows that high CO coverage induces Ni adatoms, promoting methanation. At higher temperatures, fewer adatoms increase CO selectivity. This study highlights how reaction intermediates dynamically affect catalytic behavior, offering insights into material behavior under real conditions.







Abstract
The Reverse Water Gas&#8208;Shift reaction (CO2+H2

 ${ \mathbin{{\stackrel{\textstyle\rightharpoonup}   { {\smash{\leftharpoondown}}  }  }} }$



CO+H2O) allows to balance syn&#8208;gas under industrial conditions. Nickel has been suggested as a potential catalyst but the temperature required is too high, more than 800&#8201;&#176;C, limiting practical implementation but when lowering the temperature methanation occurs. Simulations via Density Functional Theory on well&#8208;defined surfaces have systematically failed to reproduce these experimental results. But under reaction conditions, Ni surfaces are not static and DFT models coupled to microkinetics show that low temperatures (high CO coverages) drive the generation of Ni adatoms that are the active sites for methanation. At higher temperatures, the adatom population decreases, and the selectivity towards CO increases. Thus the mechanism behind the selectivity switch is driven by the dynamics induced by reaction intermediates. Our work contributes to the inclusion of dynamic aspects of materials under reaction conditions in the understanding of complex catalytic behaviour.

&lt;p&gt;Surface dynamics is the key to explain the product distribution of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation on Ni. Density Functional Theory combined with microkinetic simulations shows that high CO coverage induces Ni adatoms, promoting methanation. At higher temperatures, fewer adatoms increase CO selectivity. This study highlights how reaction intermediates dynamically affect catalytic behavior, offering insights into material behavior under real conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;

CO+H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) allows to balance syn-gas under industrial conditions. Nickel has been suggested as a potential catalyst but the temperature required is too high, more than 800&#8201;&#176;C, limiting practical implementation but when lowering the temperature methanation occurs. Simulations via Density Functional Theory on well-defined surfaces have systematically failed to reproduce these experimental results. But under reaction conditions, Ni surfaces are not static and DFT models coupled to microkinetics show that low temperatures (high CO coverages) drive the generation of Ni adatoms that are the active sites for methanation. At higher temperatures, the adatom population decreases, and the selectivity towards CO increases. Thus the mechanism behind the selectivity switch is driven by the dynamics induced by reaction intermediates. Our work contributes to the inclusion of dynamic aspects of materials under reaction conditions in the understanding of complex catalytic behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iodine Boosted Fluoro&#8208;Organic Borate Electrolytes Enabling Fluent Ion&#8208;Conductive Solid Electrolyte Interphase for High&#8208;Performance Magnesium Metal Batteries</title>

This study presents an innovative electrolyte formulation for rechargeable magnesium batteries, addressing the challenges of complex synthesis and magnesium anode passivation seen in traditional boron&#8208;based salts. By combining tri(hexafluoroisopropyl) borate (B(HFIP)3) and iodine (I2) in 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME), the system evolves into Mg[B(HFIP)4]2/DME&#8208;MgI2 upon contact with the Mg anode. This results in a solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, enhancing Mg plating and stripping efficiency. Our proposed synthetic reaction and in situ formation of SEI later also has universality for other B(OR)3, where R represents different F substitution. This formulation exhibits superior electrochemical performance, low overpotential, and long cycling life, outperforming previous boron&#8208;based electrolytes.







Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries are regarded as a promising multi&#8208;valent battery system for low&#8208;cost and sustainable energy storage applications. Boron&#8208;based organic magnesium salts with terminal substituent fluorinated anions (Mg[B(ORF)4]2, RF=fluorinated alkyl) have exhibited impressive electrochemical stability and oxidative stability. Nevertheless, their deployment is hindered by the complicated synthesis routes and the surface passivation of Mg metal anode. Herein, we report the design of an advanced electrolyte formulation comprised of tri(hexafluoroisopropyl) borate (B(HFIP)3) and iodine (I2) in 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME) solvent, which eventually convert into a Mg[B(HFIP)4]2/DME&#8208;MgI2 electrolyte system upon interacting with Mg anode. The Mg anode reacts with I2 and the electron&#8208;accepting B(HFIP)3, leading to the in situ formation of a solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase layer composed of MgF2 and MgI2 species that can facilitate fast and stable Mg plating/stripping. Compared with the pristine Mg[B(HFIP)4]2/DME electrolyte, the Mg[B(HFIP)4]2/DME&#8208;MgI2 electrolyte exhibited superior electrochemical performance including an ultra&#8208;low overpotential (~80&#8197;mV), high Coulombic efficiency and a long&#8208;cycling period over 1500&#8197;h. In result, the rechargeable magnesium batteries with Mg[B(HFIP)4]2/DME&#8208;MgI2 electrolyte and Chevrel&#8208;phase Mo6S8 cathode show outstanding compatibility, rapid kinetics, and stable cyclability for over 1200 cycles, surpassing all previously reported boron&#8208;based electrolytes. This work introduces a promising halogen&#8208;enhancement strategy for boron&#8208;based Mg&#8208;ion electrolytes, with the overarching goal of establishing favorable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphases that are pivotal for the advancement and optimization of multi&#8208;valent secondary batteries.

         <title>Unconventional Near&#8208;Equilibrium Nucleation of Graphene on Si&#8208;Terminated SiC(0001) Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene nucleation on Si&#8208;terminated hexagonal&#8208;SiC(0001) surface is elucidated. The stable carbon clusters, preferential nucleation sites and nucleation pathways are revealed, and a nucleation diagram is established. Contradictory experimental observations on graphene growth on SiC(0001) surface are explained. Nucleation on terraces instead of near step edges is proposed to be crucial for producing high&#8208;quality graphene on SiC(0001) surface.







Abstract
The transfer&#8208;free character of graphene growth on Silicon Carbide (SiC) makes it compatible with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Si semiconductor technologies for directly fabricating high&#8208;end electronics. Although significant progress has been achieved in epitaxial growth of graphene on SiC recently, the underlying nucleation mechanism remains elusive. Here, we present a theoretical study to elucidate graphene near&#8208;equilibrium nucleation on Si&#8208;terminated hexagonal&#8208;SiC(0001) surface. It is found that the ultra&#8208;large lattice mismatch between SiC(0001) surface and graphene and the highly localized electron distribution on SiC(0001) surface lead to a distinctive nucleation process: (i)&#8197;Most of the magic carbon clusters on SiC(0001) show only C1 symmetry and are mainly composed of pentagonal rings; (ii)&#8197;Two possible nucleation pathways are revealed, i.e., longitudinal and circular modes; (iii)&#8197;Carbon clusters are more stable on flat terraces than near atomic step edges. Based on above findings, a graphene nucleation diagram on SiC(0001) is established and experimentally observed contradictories for graphene growth on SiC(0001) are answered. Our in&#8208;depth understanding on graphene nucleation on SiC(0001) extends nucleation mechanisms of 2D crystals and will benefit high&#8208;quality graphene growth on SiC(0001).

         <title>Switchable Topologically Chiral [2]Catenane as Multiple Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter for Efficient Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing topologically chiral [2]catenane as the chiral platform and switching scaffold, the first stimuli&#8208;responsive topologically chiral multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitter with |gPL| reaching up to 1.6&#215;10&#8722;2 was successfully constructed. It further serves as an excellent emitter layer for the fabrication of efficient circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs).







Abstract
Aiming at the fabrication of circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) with high dissymmetry factors (gEL) and color purity through the employment of novel chiral source, topologically chiral [2]catenanes were first utilized as the key chiral skeleton to construct novel multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters. Impressively, the efficient chirality induction and unique switchable feature of topologically chiral [2]catenane not only lead to a high |gPL| value up to 1.6&#215;10&#8722;2 but also facilitate in situ dynamic switching of the full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Furthermore, the solution&#8208;processed CP&#8208;OLEDs based on the resultant topologically chiral emitters exhibit a narrow FWHM of 36&#8197;nm, maximum external quantum efficiency of 17.6&#8201;%, and CPEL with |gEL| of 2.1&#215;10&#8722;3. This study demonstrates the successful construction of the first CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF emitters based on topological chirality with the highest |gPL| among the reported CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF emitters and excellent device performance to the best of our knowledge. Moreover, it endowed the MR&#8208;TADF emitter with distinctive switchable CPL performances, thus providing a novel design strategy as well as a promising platform for developing intelligent CP&#8208;OLEDs.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Wide Modulation and Reversible Reconfiguration of a Flexible Organic Crystalline Optical Waveguide Between 645 and 731&#8197;nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic crystal that displays long&#8208;distance light transduction up to 2.0&#8197;cm and a remarkably wide&#8208;range modulation of flexible crystalline optical waveguides between red (645&#8197;nm) and near infrared (731&#8197;nm) in both the pristine and the elastically bent states has been developed based on a pre&#8208;designed self&#8208;absorption effect. The flexible organic crystalline optical waveguides can be precisely and reversibly reconfigured by controlling the irradiation position.







Abstract
Flexible organic crystalline optical waveguides, which deliver input or self&#8208;emit light through various dynamic organic crystals, have attracted increasing attention in the past decade. However, the modulation of the waveguide output relies on chemical design and substituent modification, being time&#8208;consuming and laborious. Here we report an elastic organic crystal that displays long&#8208;distance light transduction up to 2.0&#8197;cm and an ultra&#8208;wide modulation of crystalline optical waveguides between red (645&#8197;nm) and near infrared (731&#8197;nm) in both the pristine and the elastically bent states based on a pre&#8208;designed self&#8208;absorption effect. The flexible organic crystalline optical waveguides can be precisely and reversibly reconfigured by controlling the irradiation point. In addition, deep&#8208;red amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) that is able to transduce through a 5.0&#8197;mm bent crystal with an ultra&#8208;low optical loss coefficient of 0.093&#8197;dB/mm has been attained. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of flexible organic ASE waveguides. The present study not only provides a simple yet effective strategy to remarkably modulate flexible organic crystalline optical waveguides but also demonstrates the superiority of lasing over normal emission as flexible optical communication elements.

         <title>Integrating Multiple Redox&#8208;Active Units into Conductive Covalent Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;active tri(dithiolylidene)cyclohexanetrione centers have been successfully integrated into a series of covalent organic frameworks with two&#8208;dimensional crystalline structures, excellent stability, high porosity, and good conductivity, and rich Na+ storage sites, making them suitable anode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
The rational design of porous covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high conductivity and reversible redox activity is the key to improving their performance in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, we report a series of COFs (FPDC&#8208;TPA&#8208;COF, FPDC&#8208;TPB&#8208;COF, and FPDC&#8208;TPT&#8208;COF) based on an organosulfur linker, (trioxocyclohexane&#8208;triylidene)tris(dithiole&#8208;diylylidene))hexabenzaldehyde (FPDC). These COFs feature two&#8208;dimensional crystalline structures, high porosity, good conductivity, and densely packed redox&#8208;active sites, making them suitable for energy storage devices. Among them, FPDC&#8208;TPT&#8208;COF demonstrates a remarkably high specific capacity of 420&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), excellent cycling stability (~87&#8201;% capacity retention after 3000 cycles, 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and high rate performance (339&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) as an anode for SIBs, surpassing most reported COF&#8208;based electrodes. The superior performance is attributed to the dithiole moieties enhancing the conductivity and the presence of redox&#8208;active carbonyl, imine, and triazine sites facilitating Na storage. Furthermore, the sodiation mechanism was elucidated through in situ experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work highlights the advantages of integrating multiple functional groups into redox&#8208;active COFs for the rational design of efficient and stable SIBs.

         <title>Fabrication of Hierarchical Nanostructures Featuring Amplified Asymmetry Through Co&#8208;Assembly of Liquid Crystalline Block Copolymer and Chiral Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hierarchical colloidal architectures, characterized by distinct asymmetry, were fabricated through the co&#8208;assembly of a liquid crystal block copolymer (LC&#8208;BCP) with amphiphiles containing chiral amino acid linkers. This study elucidates the regulatory pathways for hierarchical assembly via synergistic effects, highlighting how subtle changes in linker structure can effectively fine&#8208;tune transitions in helical and hierarchical morphology.







Abstract
The widespread presence of hierarchical asymmetric structures in nature has sparked considerable interest because of their unique functionalities. These ingenious structures across multiple scales often emerge from the transfer and amplification of asymmetry from chiral molecules under various synergistic effects. However, constructing artificial chiral asymmetric structures, particularly in developing hierarchical multicomponent structures analogous to those formed in nature through synergistic non&#8208;covalent interactions, still presents tremendous challenges. Herein, we propose a co&#8208;assembly strategy to fabricate hierarchical chiral mesostructures by combining a liquid crystalline block copolymer (LC&#8208;BCP) with a small molecular amphiphile containing chiral alanine or phenylalanine as a linker. Through a classic solvent&#8208;exchange process, chiral amphiphiles embedded within LC&#8208;BCP finely regulate the LC ordering effect and facilitate transfer and amplification of asymmetry. Consequently, various co&#8208;assembled structures with significant hierarchical chirality features are obtained through synergetic effects. Remarkably, subtle alterations to the side groups of amino acids in the amphiphiles effectively adjust the hierarchical morphology transition. Moreover, the covalent bonding sequence of amino acids in the amphiphiles emerges as a critical factor governing the formation of hierarchical nanofibers and multilayered vesicles exhibiting a superhelical sense.

         <title>Pd(0)/Pd(II) Electromerism Triggered by Lewis Base Coordination to a Redox&#8208;Active Silicon Z&#8208;Type Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Z&#8208;type interactions make it possible: Oxidation of the neutral bis(phosphanyl&#8208;amidophenolato)silane Z&#8208;type palladium(0) complex results in a dicationic ligand&#8208;centered singlet diradical/Pd(0) complex. Previously unprecedented Pd(0)/Pd(II) electromerism can be triggered by coordination of a Lewis base to the silane. Abstraction of the Lewis base with silylium ions reverses this electromerism.







Abstract
Electromerism (aka. valence tautomerism) corresponds to the switching of electronic distributions between redox&#8208;active ligands and central elements. While this phenomenon is well established for several transition metals, the Pd(0)/Pd(II) couple could not yet be involved due to the high energy of the Pd(0) state. In this study, we present Pd(0)/Pd(II) electromerism by using a redox&#8208;active bis(phosphanyl&#8208;amidophenolato)silane. Strong silicon&#8208;based Z&#8208;type interaction stabilizes the Pd(0) state with an oxidized dicationic open&#8208;shell singlet ligand while binding of a Lewis base at the Lewis acidic silicon results in the loss of Z&#8208;type interaction and the intramolecular rearrangement to the Pd(II)/reduced ligand electromer. It introduces a novel concept for spin state switching by combining ligand ambiphilicity and redox activity.

         <title>Exploiting High Order Magnetic Anisotropy for Advanced Magnetocaloric Refrigerants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;crystal experiments on the novel 3&#8201;d&#8211;4&#8201;f complex [DyDOTA][CrF2(py)4] (DOTA=tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;tetraacetate, py=pyridine) have revealed a tetragonal easy&#8208;plane magnetic anisotropy. Temperature and magnetic&#8208;field dependent experiments to evaluate the rotating magnetocaloric effect demonstrated the potential of high&#8208;order anisotropies for developing more efficient magnetocaloric materials.







Abstract
Three new 3&#8201;d&#8211;4&#8201;f complexes of general formula trans&#8208;[MF2(py)4][LnDOTA] (M=Cr3+ or Co3+, Ln=Dy3+ or Y3+, py=pyridine and DOTA=tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;tetraacetate) have been synthetised.

&lt;p&gt;Single-crystal experiments on the novel 3&#8201;d&#8211;4&#8201;f complex [DyDOTA][CrF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(py)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] (DOTA=tetraazacyclododecane-N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;-tetraacetate, py=pyridine) have revealed a tetragonal easy-plane magnetic anisotropy. Temperature and magnetic-field dependent experiments to evaluate the rotating magnetocaloric effect demonstrated the potential of high-order anisotropies for developing more efficient magnetocaloric materials.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Oxidation of Benzene to Phenol with O2 over Photoinduced Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Rich WO3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs) can be facilely generated and finely confined adjacent to the reductive sites of WO3 via a gentle photoetching approach. Such photoinduced OVs are advantageous for photocatalytic oxidation of benzene to phenol with O2, matching well with the charge carrier dynamics to immediately capture the photogenerated electrons from the reductive sites to activate the adsorbed O2.







Abstract
Direct photocatalytic conversion of benzene to phenol with molecular oxygen (O2) is a green alternative to the traditional synthesis. The key is to find an effective photocatalyst to do the trick. Defect engineering of semiconductors with oxygen vacancies (OVs) is an emerging strategy for catalyst fabrication. OVs can trap electrons to promote charge separation and serving as adsorption sites for O2 activation. However, the randomly distribution of OVs on the semiconductor surface often results in mismatching the charge carrier dynamics under irradiation, thus failing to fulfill the unique advantages of OVs for photoredox functions. Herein, we demonstrate that abundant OVs can be facilely generated and precisely located adjacent to the reductive sites on reducible oxide semiconductors such as tungsten oxide (WO3) via a simple photochemistry strategy. Such photoinduced OVs are well suited for photocatalytic benzene oxidation with O2 as they readily capture photogenerated electrons from the reductive sites of WO3 to activate adsorbed O2. The oxygen&#8208;isotope&#8208;labeling experiments further confirm that the OVs also facilitate the integration of oxygen atoms from O2 into phenol, revealing in detail the pathway for photocatalytic benzene hydroxylation. This study demonstrates that the photochemistry approach is an appealing strategy for the synthesis of high&#8208;performance OVs&#8208;rich photocatalysts for solar&#8208;induced chemical conversion.

         <title>Construction of Slide&#8208;Ring Polymers Based on Pillar[5]Arene/Alkyl Chain Host&#8722;Guest Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uitilizing the host&#8722;guest complexation between a pillar[5]arene and poly(caprolactone), we synthesized a polyrotaxane as a precursor for constructing slide&#8208;ring polymers. The pulley effect in the resultant slide&#8208;ring polymers under external force endows them with a unique stress&#8208;dissipation capability, resulting in outstanding mechanical properties.







Abstract
Slide&#8208;ring polymers exhibit distinctive mechanical properties, making them highly promising for applications in emerging fields such as energy storage devices and smart sensing. However, existing slide&#8208;ring polymer systems primarily rely on hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic interactions to achieve ring&#8208;axle interlocking in aqueous phases. This reliance limits the construction of slide&#8208;ring networks mainly to water&#8208;soluble polymers, excluding a diverse range of lipophilic polymers. Therefore, it is crucial to introduce efficient construction strategies that facilitate interpenetration in organic solvents, enabling the development of diverse slide&#8208;ring polymers and expanding their range and applications. Herein, by utilizing the pillar[5]arene/alkyl chain host&#8722;guest interactions, we successfully facilitated the interpenetration of a pillar[5]arene and poly(caprolactone), enabling the efficient construction of two slide&#8208;ring polymer networks in organic solvents. One of these two slide&#8208;ring polymers demonstrates a unique network deformation mechanism along with outstanding mechanical properties compared with the control covalently cross&#8208;linked polymer network, including maximum stress (4.43 vs 1.98&#8197;MPa), maximum strain (1285 vs 330&#8201;%), and toughness (35.4 vs 3.92&#8197;MJ/m3). More importantly, this strategy of making slide&#8208;ring polymers is highly versatile, given the wide range of macrocyclic arenes and alkyl chain&#8208;containing polymers it can accommodate.

         <title>Homologation of Alkenyl Carbonyls via a Cyclopropanation/Light&#8208;Mediated Selective C&#8722;C Cleavage Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report herein a strategy for the homologation of alkenyl carbonyls via a sequence of cyclopropanation/light&#8208;mediated selective C&#8722;C cleavage. Depending on the substrate structure, intramolecular photoisomerization processes were favored or [3+2] annulations could be developed. Furthermore, a unified reductive strategy for the ring&#8208;opening of carbonyl cyclopropanes was achieved using diphenyl disulfide as a HAT reagent. These transformations open up new possibility for formal CH2 insertion onto the &#945;,&#946; C&#8722;C bond of unsaturated carbonyl compounds, extending the current toolbox for the &#8220;skeletal editing&#8221; of aliphatic carbocycles.







Abstract
We report herein our studies on the direct photoactivation of carbonyl cyclopropanes to give biradical intermediates, leading to selective cleavage of the more substituted carbon&#8208;carbon bond. Depending on the substrate structure, extended alkenes were isolated or directly reacted in a photo&#8208;Nazarov process to give bicyclic products. Based on these results, a unified reductive ring&#8208;opening reaction was developed by using diphenyl disulfide as a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reagent. By performing a sequential cyclopropanation/selective ring opening reaction, we achieved a CH2 insertion into the &#945;,&#946; bond of both acyclic and cyclic unsaturated carbonyl compounds. Our protocol provides a further tool for the modification of the carbon framework of organic compounds, complementing the recent progress in &#8220;skeletal editing&#8221;.

         <title>Constructing Tandem Fenton&#8208;like Reaction Systems Based on Structure Adaption to Boost Water Contaminant Mineralization Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art water purification technology in addressing water saftey. A conceptualizaiton of tandem reaction system based on structure adaption of target contaminants to reactive oxygen species reactivity was firstly proposed to boost the mineralization of emerging contaminants, which may serve as cost&#8208;attractive mode to design green and high&#8208;efficiency AOPs for advanced water treatment.







Abstract
Mineralization of emerging contaminants by using advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) is a desirable option to ensure water safety, but still challenged by the excessive chemical and/or energy input. Here, we conceptually proposed the tandem reaction system (TRS) of different reactive oxygen species (ROS) based on structure adaption of target contaminants. To construct a model TRS, we first realized highly selective generation of three classical ROS (1O2, HO&#8901; and SO4&#8901;&#8722;) by peroxymonosulfate activation in an electrochemical Fenton&#8208;like system, where three replaceable Fe&#8208;centered cathodes were rationally designed as electronic mediator. The 1O2+SO4&#8901;&#8722;&#8208;TRS exhibited nearly 100&#8201;% mineralization of sulfamethoxazole (SMX), whereas only 34.2&#8201;%, 56.2&#8201;% and 60.8&#8201;% for each of the single 1O2/HO&#8901;/SO4&#8901;&#8722;&#8208;AOP systems. Mechanism exploration of SMX degradation in TRS evidenced that the initial reaction with 1O2 selectively destructed the sulfonamide bridge of SMX to form p&#8208;aminobenzenesulfonic acid, which will be vulnerable to sequent SO4&#8901;&#8722; attack to facilitate mineralization. Successful extendibility of 1O2+SO4&#8901;&#8722;&#8208;TRS to other sulfonamide antibiotics and 1O2+HO&#8901;&#8208;TRS to phenolic and arylcarboxylic compounds, as well as the demonstration of 1O2+SO4&#8901;&#8722;&#8208;TRS in treatment of three actual pharmaceutical wastewaters strongly support that TRS is a powerful and sustainable strategy to enhance the mineralization of emerging contaminants in water.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mineralization of emerging contaminants by using advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) is a desirable option to ensure water safety, but still challenged by the excessive chemical and/or energy input. Here, we conceptually proposed the tandem reaction system (TRS) of different reactive oxygen species (ROS) based on structure adaption of target contaminants. To construct a model TRS, we first realized highly selective generation of three classical ROS (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, HO&#8901; and SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) by peroxymonosulfate activation in an electrochemical Fenton-like system, where three replaceable Fe-centered cathodes were rationally designed as electronic mediator. The &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-TRS exhibited nearly 100&#8201;% mineralization of sulfamethoxazole (SMX), whereas only 34.2&#8201;%, 56.2&#8201;% and 60.8&#8201;% for each of the single &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/HO&#8901;/SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-AOP systems. Mechanism exploration of SMX degradation in TRS evidenced that the initial reaction with &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectively destructed the sulfonamide bridge of SMX to form &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-aminobenzenesulfonic acid, which will be vulnerable to sequent SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; attack to facilitate mineralization. Successful extendibility of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-TRS to other sulfonamide antibiotics and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+HO&#8901;-TRS to phenolic and arylcarboxylic compounds, as well as the demonstration of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-TRS in treatment of three actual pharmaceutical wastewaters strongly support that TRS is a powerful and sustainable strategy to enhance the mineralization of emerging contaminants in water.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoinduced Bartoli Indole Synthesis by the Oxidative Cleavage of Alkenes with Nitro(hetero)arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoinduced Bartoli indole synthesis was first reported for the construction of indoles and azaindoles by the oxidative cleavage of alkenes with nitro(hetero)arenes. The novel reactivity of N&#8722;O=C dipoles, involving the rearrangement of carbonyl imines, enhances the comprehension of dipole chemistry.







Abstract
Given the unique charm of dipole chemistry, intercepting N&#8722;O=C dipoles precisely generated by designed processes to develop novel reactivity has become a seminal challenge. The polar fragmentation of 1,3,2&#8208;dioxazolidine species generated through the radical addition of excited nitro(hetero)arenes to alkenes represents a significantly underappreciated mechanism for generating N&#8722;O=C dipoles. Herein, we present a photoinduced Bartoli indole synthesis by the oxidative cleavage of alkenes with nitro(hetero)arenes. Various indoles and azaindoles are constructed through the multi&#8208;step spontaneous rearrangement of carbonyl imine intermediates generated by the polar fragmentation of 1,3,2&#8208;dioxazolidine species. Mechanism studies and DFT calculations support that the reaction involves radical cycloaddition, ozonolysis&#8208;type cycloreversion, intramolecular H&#8208;shift of carbonyl imines, and 3,3&#8208;sigmatropic shift of O&#8208;Alkenyl hydroxylamines, etc. The implementation of continuous&#8208; flow photochemistry, in particular, significantly enhances efficiency, thereby overcoming obstacles to the commercialization process.

         <title>Asymmetric Palladium Migration for Synthesis of Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;Cage o&#8208;Carboranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric Pd migration is described to achieve enantioselective 3,4&#8208;bifunctionalization of o&#8208;carboranes. High efficiency with up to 98&#8201;% ee can be achieved in this Pd catalyzed alkenylation and iodo&#8208;migration tandem reaction, which can be applied in the further one&#8208;pot preparation of bifunctionalized chiral&#8208;at&#8208;cage o&#8208;carborane derivatives.







Abstract
Metal migration strategy can offer BH functionalization of o&#8208;carboranes at different positions from where initial bond activation occurs to achieve bifunctionalized o&#8208;carboranes in one reaction. We report in this article an enantioselective 3,4&#8208;bifunctionalization of o&#8208;carboranes via asymmetric Pd migration with a high efficiency and up to 98&#8201;% ee. This asymmetric catalysis has a broad substrates scope, leading to the preparation of a class of chiral&#8208;at&#8208;cage o&#8208;carborane derivatives. The enantiocontrol model is suggested on the basis of density functional theory (DFT) results, where the chiral Trost ligand plays a crucial role in this enantioselective Pd migration from exo&#8208;alkenyl sp2 C to the cage B(4) position of o&#8208;carborane.

         <title>Cu&#8722;Bi Bimetallic Catalysts Derived from Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Arrays on Copper Foam for Efficient Glycine Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel heterometallic doping strategy was developed to fabricate a bi&#8208;metal&#8211;organic framework derived array on copper foam (Cu/Bi&#8722;C@CF) for converting nitrogen oxides species coupling with &#945;&#8208;keto acids into amino acids, which presenting a high selectivity (89&#8201;%) and excellent Faraday efficiency (65.9&#8201;%) towards glycine electrosynthesis due to the synergistic effect between Bi and Cu.







Abstract
Glycine as one of the most abundant amino acids in human proteins, with extensive applications in both life and industry, is conventionally synthesized through complex procedures or toxic feedstocks. In this study, we present a facile and benign electrochemical pathway for synthesis of glycine through reductive coupling of glyoxylic acid and nitrate over a copper&#8208;bismuth bimetal catalyst derived from a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) array on copper foam (Cu/Bi&#8722;C@CF). Remarkably, Cu/Bi&#8722;C@CF achieves a fantastic selectivity of 89&#8201;%, corresponding a high Faraday efficiency of 65.9&#8201;%. From control experiments, the introduction of Bi caused the binding energy of Cu shift to a lower state, which leads to a high selectivity towards the formation of key intermediate hydroxylamine rather than ammonia product, facilitating the formation of oxime and providing additional sites for subsequent hydrogenation reaction on the way to glycine. Moreover, the derivation of MOF arrays ensures the effective dispersion of Bi and enhances the stability of Cu/Bi&#8722;C@CF. This innovative approach not only presents sustainable pathways for the production of value&#8208;added organonitrogen compounds utilizing readily available carbon and nitrogen sources, but also provides novel insights into the design of multistage structural catalysts for sequential reactions.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Emitting Helically Twisted Conjugated Frameworks Consisting of Alternant Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Acceptor Units and Multiple Boron Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of boron&#8208;induced coordination&#8208;enhanced charge transfer (CE&#8208;CT) and a helically twisted conjugated framework has led to a family of helically twisted D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A conjugated systems showing red to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission, with the cis/trans configurational isomers exhibiting similar photophysical properties. The observed narrow, red&#8208;shifted emission could be explained by theoretical calculations.







Abstract
A novel design strategy to construct bright and narrow near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission materials with suppressed shoulder peaks can significantly enhance their performance in various applications. Herein, we have successfully synthesized a series of helically twisted D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A conjugated systems bridged by boron atoms, achieving bright red to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emissions with notably narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) values of 35&#8197;nm (0.08&#8197;eV) and photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) up to 80&#8201;%. These compounds display red&#8208;shifted emissions up to 753&#8197;nm in higher concentrations. Cis/trans configurational isomers of multi&#8208;boron&#8208;bridged molecule BN3 exhibit similar photophysical properties. The unique combination of boron&#8208;induced coordination&#8208;enhanced charge transfer (CE&#8208;CT) and the helically twisted conjugated framework is pivotal in achieving the red&#8208;shifted, narrowband emission. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of BN2 and BN3&#8208;a reveals that the extension of boron&#8208;bridged D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A skeletons significantly increases the distortion of the skeleton. Systematic theoretical calculations show how the boron CE&#8208;CT mechanism, in conjunction with the helical twist, leads to the narrowing of emission bands while simultaneously red&#8208;shifting them into the NIR region. This work could open new avenues for the development of advanced materials with tailored optical properties, particularly in the challenging and highly sought&#8208;after NIR spectrum.

The unique combination of boron-induced coordination-enhanced charge transfer (CE-CT) and the helically twisted conjugated framework is pivotal in achieving the red-shifted, narrowband emission. X-ray crystallographic analysis of BN2 and BN3-a reveals that the extension of boron-bridged D-&#960;-A skeletons significantly increases the distortion of the skeleton. Systematic theoretical calculations show how the boron CE-CT mechanism, in conjunction with the helical twist, leads to the narrowing of emission bands while simultaneously red-shifting them into the NIR region. This work could open new avenues for the development of advanced materials with tailored optical properties, particularly in the challenging and highly sought-after NIR spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Coplanarity and Giant Birefringence in Hydroxypyridinium Nitrate via Hydrogen Bonding between Planar Donors and Planar Acceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy that utilizes hydrogen bonding between planar donors and planar acceptors is proposed. Guided by this stratedy, the giant birefringence achieved by ionic crystal, (C5H6ON)+(NO3)&#8722;, 4HPN, is achieved. This concept has convincingly demonstrated its applicability and relevance across a diverse array of systems, providing a guiding principle in design synthesis.







Abstract
Birefringent crystals, which possess optical anisotropy, are important optical components. However, designing and synthesizing birefringent crystals faces the challenge of achieving anisotropic structures, especially coplanar geometries. Herein, we achieve a significant birefringence in an ionic compound (C5H6ON)+(NO3)&#8722;, (4&#8208;hydroxypyridinium nitrate, 4HPN) by hydrogen bonding between planar donors and planar acceptors. We demonstrate that the interactions between the planar hydrogen bond donor ((C5H6ON)+) and planar hydrogen bond acceptor ((NO3)&#8722;) ensure the coplanarity during the crystal packing, generating the desired giant optical anisotropy. On two manually cut crystal chips, we observe a

 value already surpasses those of the benchmark crystals, e.g., YVO4 and CaCO3, commonly used in the UV to visible and near IR spectral range. 4HPN also exhibits a strong second harmonic generation response (9.55&#215;KDP). This strategy offers a promising avenue for the design and development of birefringent crystals with potential applications in optical communication, sensing and signal processing devices.

         <title>Sustaining 500,000 Folding Cycles Through Bioinspired Stress Dispersion Design in Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first&#8208;ever super&#8208;foldable sodium&#8208;ion battery is fabricated via a &#8220;2+1&#8221; biomimetic strategy. The battery can bear 500,000 true&#8208;folding cycles in any directions, with no compromise to its structure or performance. Real&#8208;time dynamic folding observation reveals M&#8208;shaped structures cleverly dispersing stress through bulged layers, dispersed arcs, and slidable microgrooves&#8212;a breakthrough that sets the stage for future super&#8208;foldable devices.







Abstract
Developing super&#8208;foldable electronic materials and devices presents a significant challenge, as intrinsic conductive materials are unable to achieve numerous true&#8208;folding operations (super&#8208;foldable) due to limitations from short&#8208;range forces of chemical bonds. Consequently, super&#8208;foldable batteries remain unexplored. This work focused on sodium&#8208;ion batteries as a breakthrough point to advance super&#8208;foldable devices. By employing a &#8220;2+1&#8221; bioinspired strategy, we stepwise designed and assembled super&#8208;foldable components, from substrates to electrodes, and to ultimately device. This bioinspired approach completely disperses folding stress and thus prevents the breakage of chemical bonds, enabling the successful fabrication of the first super&#8208;foldable ion battery. This battery can withstand true&#8208;folding at any angle, in any direction, and for an unprecedented number of cycles&#8212;far outperforming current foldable phones with hinge structures. Remarkably, after 500,000 true&#8208;folding cycles, the battery's microstructure remains intact with no significant degradation of electrochemical performance. Real&#8208;time dynamic folding observations reveal an M&#8208;shaped folding structure within the bioinspired materials, which effectively disperses stress via bulged layers, dispersed arcs, and slidable microgrooves that work together across different directions and dimensions to achieve super&#8208;foldability. Mechanical simulations vividly verify this principle. This work represents a breakthrough in super&#8208;foldable devices, offering valuable insights and promoting practical application for future super&#8208;foldable devices.

         <title>Regulation of Exciton Effects in Functionalized Conjugated Polymers by B&#8208;N Lewis Pairs for Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constructing a B&#8722;N Lewis pair and adjusting Lewis acid basicity could minimize the exciton binding energy and prolong the lifetime of the exciton, thus significantly improving the charge separation and transfer efficiency. PyPBM exhibits an exponentially enhanced activity towards photocatalytic H2 and H2O2 production with visible light irradiation.







Abstract
Strong excitonic effects are common in organic conjugated polymer semiconductors, severely hindering the generation of free charge carriers for conducting photocatalysis. Therefore, exploring new channels to modulate exciton dissociation in polymers is far&#8208;reaching in facilitating photocatalysis. A series of B&#8722;N Lewis pair functionalized conjugated polymers have been developed to minimize exciton effects by modulating charge transfer pathways. Theoretical studies have shown that introducing B&#8722;N Lewis pairs can dramatically increase the distance of charge transfer (D index) and the amount of electron transfer and reduce the Coulomb attraction energy (EC), which contributes to breaking the equilibrium of the coexistence of excitons and charge carriers. Further experimental results show that the singlet excitons are efficiently dissociated into more free&#8208;charge carriers under photoexcitation to participate in surface reactions. The optimized polymer PyPBM shows an exponential increase in photocatalytic hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide production performance by visible light illumination.

The electron count affects the shape of Bi6q&#8722; units, from a regular prism in Bi62&#8722; (left) to a regular crown&#8208;type cycle in Bi66&#8722; (right). Such units were previously isolated in the coordination sphere of metal complexes, while the (less symmetric) intermediate with a &#8722;4 charge has only been predicted by theory. In their Research Article (e202417234), Florian Weigend, Stefanie Dehnen et&#8197;al. isolated the Zintl cluster [Bi6{Zn(hmds)}2]2&#8722; (center), in which two 12&#8208;electron fragments are perfectly suited to stabilize the boat&#8208;type Bi64&#8722; unit, as confirmed by DFT calculations.

Bioorthogonal bond&#8208;cleavage reactions enable precise control of (bio)molecular function in biological systems. In their Research Article (e202411707), Hannes Mikula et al. report the development of &#8220;yellow&#8221; hydroxyaryl&#8208;tetrazines as bioorthogonal tools for efficient click&#8208;to&#8208;release of trans&#8208;cyclooctenes. The cover picture illustrates the transformation of &#8220;rusty&#8221; pink tetrazines into &#8220;sharp&#8221; bioorthogonal scissors for rapid and near&#8208;quantitative click&#8208;triggered bond&#8208;cleavage.

         <title>Calcium Chemistry as A New Member of Post&#8208;Lithium Battery Family: What Can We Learn from Sodium and Magnesium Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium batteries are promising post&#8208;lithium technology featuring high&#8208;energy, low&#8208;cost and sustainability. According to the periodic table, Ca has similar physicochemical properties with Na and Mg in some aspects. This review discusses the similarity and difference between Ca and the other two more matured battery chemistries, hoping to provide new insights into the transport and storage mechanisms that accelerate the development of the emerging technology.







Abstract
The development of next&#8208;generation battery technologies needs to consider their environmental impact throughout the whole cycle life, which has brought new chemistries based on earth&#8208;abundant elements into the spotlight. Rechargeable calcium batteries are such an emerging technology, which shows the potential to provide high cell voltage and high energy density close to lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Additionally, the use of Ca2+ as a charge carrier renders significant sustainable values. Although pioneering work on the electrochemistry of Ca has been carried out for more than half a century, demonstration of reversible Ca0/Ca2+ redox chemistry in non&#8208;aqueous media was only achieved within the past decade. In this review, we will present recent development of rechargeable calcium batteries, focusing on mainly the similarities but also differences between Ca chemistry and other post&#8208;lithium chemistry. According to the periodic nature of elements, magnesium (an alkaline earth element as Ca) and sodium (a diagonally adjacent element to Ca) have similar chemical properties to Ca in various aspects. We shall elaborate on how the solution chemistry, metal behaviors and transport mechanisms of Ca&#8208;ions can be better understood in light of the established principles in the respective Mg/Na systems. We hope the discussion will inspire synergetic development between Ca batteries and other post&#8208;lithium systems.

         <title>Nanomaterials&#8208;Induced PANoptosis: A Promising Anti&#8208;Tumor Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we delve into the foundational concept and underlying mechanisms of PANoptosis, emphasizing its pivotal role in oncology. We subsequently outline the most recent advancements in nanomedicine pertaining to PANoptosis&#8208;driven anticancer therapies. Furthermore, we explore the existing challenges and potential future directions for the clinical translation of PANoptosis&#8208;based treatments.







Abstract
Malignant tumors pose a significant threat to global public health. Promoting programmed cell death in cancer cells has become a critical strategy for cancer treatment. PANoptosis, a newly discovered form of regulated cell death, integrates key molecular components of pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis, activating these three death pathways simultaneously to achieve synergistic multi&#8208;mechanistic killing. PANoptosis significantly inhibits cancer cell growth and resistance and activates strong anti&#8208;tumor immune response, making tumor&#8208;specific induction of PANoptosis a potential cancer therapeutic strategy. Currently, cancer treatment research related to PANoptosis is focused mainly on the development of small molecules and cytokines. However, these approaches still face limitations in terms of metabolic stability and tumor specificity. The unique physicochemical properties and biological activities of nanomaterials hold significant promise for optimizing PANoptosis induction strategies. This review summarizes the concept and mechanisms of PANoptosis, highlights the latest applications of nanoagents in PANoptosis&#8208;based anti&#8208;cancer therapy, and discusses the challenges and future directions for clinical translation. It is hoped that this review will inspire further exploration and development of PANoptosis&#8208;based cancer treatments, providing new perspectives for researchers in the field.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Catalysts: From Model to Reality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials have been extensively utilized in catalytic reactions due to their fully exposed active sites and special electronic structure. This review summarizes the progress of 2D materials from model studies to application in catalysis and illustrates how 2D materials serve as models to explore structure&#8211;activity relationships by combining theoretical calculations and surface research.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials have been utilized broadly in kinds of catalytic reactions due to their fully exposed active sites and special electronic structure. Compared with real catalysts, which are usually bulk or particle, 2D materials have more well&#8208;defined structures.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-dimensional (2D) materials have been utilized broadly in kinds of catalytic reactions due to their fully exposed active sites and special electronic structure. Compared with real catalysts, which are usually bulk or particle, 2D materials have more well-defined structures. With easily identified structure-modulated engineering, 2D materials become ideal models to figure out the catalytic structure-function relations, which is helpful for the precise design of catalysts. In this review, the unique function of 2D materials was summarized from model study to reality catalysis and application. It includes several typical 2D materials, such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, metal, and metal (hydr)oxide materials. We introduced the structural characteristics of 2D materials and their advantages in model researches. It emphatically summarized how 2D materials serve as models to explore the structure-activity relationship by combining theoretical calculations and surface research. The opportunities of 2D materials and the challenges for fundamentals and applications they facing are also addressed.

         <title>Carbon Dioxide Upgrading to Biodegradable Plastics through Photo/Electro&#8208;Synthetic Biohybrid Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>

This review focuses on innovative strategies for converting CO2 into biodegradable polymers, addressing environmental challenges like CO2 emissions and plastic waste. It explores catalytic CO2 conversion, including photocatalytic&#8208;biological and electrocatalytic&#8208;biological hybrid systems, aiming to optimize processes and catalyst efficiency.







Abstract
The escalating emissions of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) and the pervasive issue of nondegradable plastic pollution underscore dual urgent challenges in pursuit of a sustainable society. Achieving such sustainability in the plastic industry, while effectively addressing these environmental concerns, necessitates the development and implementation of innovative strategies for the synthesis of biodegradable polymers utilizing CO2 as feedstocks. The technologies not only facilitate the mitigation of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations but also introduce a renewable carbon resource for polymer manufacturing. While considerable research has been undertaken in CO2 upgrading to various C1&#8208;3 products, the production of biodegradable polymers from CO2 remains a formidable challenge. Here, we delineate the principal methodologies for catalytic CO2 upgrading to biodegradable polymers, encompassing photocatalytic&#8208;biological processes and electrocatalytic&#8208;biological approaches. The emphasis of this perspective is on the optimization of production processes and catalyst efficiency, which are paramount in addressing the imperative challenge of decarbonization in the plastic industry, thereby aligning with global environmental sustainability goals.

         <title>Covalent Folding of Fluorinated Polyphenylene by Sulfur Fluorine Annulative Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monodisperse fluorinated polyphenylene undergoes folding&#8208;like sulfur fluorine annulative substitution (SFAS) to form a well&#8208;defined tubular helix H50. This is achieved with atomic precision in an exceptionally efficient manner, involving the simultaneous transformation of 98 C&#8722;F bonds with the yield per reaction site approaching 99.9&#8201;%. The desired product H50 features a fully fused dibenzothiophene skeleton of 5.8 helical turns in total and has an unambiguous single crystal X&#8208;ray structure. It can be resolved via chiral HPLC, displays distinct chiroptical properties, and forms strong through&#8208;cavity threading complex.







Abstract
We report that fluorinated polyphenylene P50 undergoes folding&#8208;like sulfur fluorine annulative substitution (SFAS) to form a well&#8208;defined tubular helix H50. This is achieved with atomic precision in an exceptionally efficient manner, involving the simultaneous transformation of 98 C&#8722;F bonds with the yield per reaction site approaching 99.9&#8201;%. The desired product H50 features a fully fused dibenzothiophene skeleton of 5.8 helical turns in total. It is truly monodisperse (&#272;=1.0) in nature, allowing for thorough spectroscopic characterizations. Unambiguous single crystal X&#8208;ray structure, distinct chiroptical properties, and intriguing through&#8208;cavity threading complexation are described. These results, in addition to those of H50&#8217;s lower congeners, H34 and H18, illustrate the great potential of folding&#8208;like SFAS in shaping random&#8208;coiled polymer chains into higher&#8208;order functional structures.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Protected Golden Fullerene Au42 with Unprecedented Metal Coordination Number of 15</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;golden fullerene&#8221; Au42 cluster topologically related to D3h C78 has a centered core&#8211;shell structure Au@Au15@Au26 featuring record high metal coordination number of 15. Its excellent stability is attributed to both the superatomic characteristics of the Au42 kernel and the gold&#8208;ligand interactions.







Abstract
A golden fullerene with a composition of [Au42(Ph3P)10(5&#8208;CF3&#8208;Hpa)8] (CF3COO)2 (5&#8208;CF3&#8208;H2pa=5&#8208;trifluoropyridyl&#8208;2&#8208;amine) (Au42) has been synthesized with pyridylamino and phosphine ligands as the protecting agents. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis reveals that the cluster has a D3h Au4210+ core, which can be depicted as a centered core&#8211;shell structure Au@Au15@Au26. The 41 Au atoms of the Au15@Au26 core&#8211;shell can be derived from placing a gold atom in the center of each polygon of C78 (D3h). Surprisingly, the centered gold atom of this noble cluster has the highest coordination number in metal nanoclusters of 15. Quantum&#8208;chemical studies suggest that the excellent stability of Au42 results from both the superatomic characteristics of the Au42 kernel and the gold&#8208;ligand interactions.

         <title>Doping Copper(I) in Ag7 Cluster for Circularly Polarized OLEDs with External Quantum Efficiency of 26.7&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alloy cluster enantiomers R/S&#8208;Ag6Cu were prepared in 85&#8201;%&#8211;87&#8201;% yield through precise substitution of the central Ag(I) atom in R/S&#8208;Ag7 with Cu(I), which not only triples quantum yield of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), but also doubles the CPL asymmetry factor. Solution&#8208;processed circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) achieves the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 26.7&#8201;%.







Abstract
Hetero&#8208;metal doping or substitution to create alloy clusters is a highly appealing strategy for improving physicochemical characteristics as well as tailoring optical and electronic properties, although high&#8208;yield synthesis of alloy clusters with precise positioning of doped metals is a daunting challenge. Herein, we manifest rational synthesis of chiral alloy cluster enantiomers R/S&#8208;Ag6Cu in 85&#8201;%&#8211;87&#8201;% yield by replacing one Ag(I) atom with Cu(I) in homometallic clusters R/S&#8208;Ag7, achieving circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a quantum yield beyond 90&#8201;%. As a small energy gap (ca. 0.07&#8197;eV) between S1 and T1 states facilitates thermally activated delay fluorescence (TADF) through reverse intersystem crossing (RISC), the photoluminescence (PL) of R/S&#8208;Ag7 and R/S&#8208;Ag6Cu at ambient temperature originates mostly from TADF (85&#8201;% and 86&#8201;%) in place of phosphorescence (15&#8201;% and 14&#8201;%). Relative to those of R/S&#8208;Ag7, copper(I) doping not only triples PL quantum yields of R/S&#8208;Ag6Cu due to accelerating ISC (intersystem crossing) and RISC, but also doubles CPL asymmetry factors of R/S&#8208;Ag6Cu ascribed to rigidizing cluster structure through stronger Ag&#8722;Cu interaction apart from dramatically improving thermodynamic stability. Solution&#8208;processable circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) demonstrate high&#8208;efficiency circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) with external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 26.7&#8201;%, which is superior to most of red&#8208;emitting OLEDs through solution process.

&lt;b&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-Ag&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;/b&gt; were prepared in 85&#8201;%&#8211;87&#8201;% yield through precise substitution of the central Ag(I) atom in &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-Ag&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; with Cu(I), which not only triples quantum yield of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), but also doubles the CPL asymmetry factor. Solution-processed circularly polarized organic light-emitting diodes (CP-OLEDs) achieves the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 26.7&#8201;%.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hetero-metal doping or substitution to create alloy clusters is a highly appealing strategy for improving physicochemical characteristics as well as tailoring optical and electronic properties, although high-yield synthesis of alloy clusters with precise positioning of doped metals is a daunting challenge. Herein, we manifest rational synthesis of chiral alloy cluster enantiomers &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-Ag&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;/b&gt; in 85&#8201;%&#8211;87&#8201;% yield by replacing one Ag(I) atom with Cu(I) in homometallic clusters &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-Ag&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, achieving circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a quantum yield beyond 90&#8201;%. As a small energy gap (ca. 0.07&#8197;eV) between S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; states facilitates thermally activated delay fluorescence (TADF) through reverse intersystem crossing (RISC), the photoluminescence (PL) of &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-Ag&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-Ag&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;/b&gt; at ambient temperature originates mostly from TADF (85&#8201;% and 86&#8201;%) in place of phosphorescence (15&#8201;% and 14&#8201;%). Relative to those of &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-Ag&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, copper(I) doping not only triples PL quantum yields of &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-Ag&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;/b&gt; due to accelerating ISC (intersystem crossing) and RISC, but also doubles CPL asymmetry factors of &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-Ag&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;/b&gt; ascribed to rigidizing cluster structure through stronger Ag&#8722;Cu interaction apart from dramatically improving thermodynamic stability. Solution-processable circularly polarized organic light-emitting diodes (CP-OLEDs) demonstrate high-efficiency circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) with external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 26.7&#8201;%, which is superior to most of red-emitting OLEDs through solution process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biosynthetic Origin of the Methoxy Group in Quinine and Related Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two substrates, tryptamine and 5&#8208;methoxytryptamine, are used in parallel by Cinchona to generate the naturally occurring mixtures of methoxy and non&#8208;methoxy Cinchona alkaloids. Discovery of the genes responsible for methoxylation allows reconstitution of biosynthetic intermediates in tobacco.







Abstract
Quinine is a historically important natural product containing a methoxy group that has been assumed to be incorporated at a late pathway stage. Here we show that the methoxy group in quinine and related alkaloids is introduced onto the starting substrate tryptamine. Feeding studies definitively show that 5&#8208;methoxytryptamine is utilized as a quinine biosynthetic intermediate in planta. We discover the biosynthetic genes that encode the responsible oxidase and methyltransferase, and we use these genes to reconstitute the early steps of the alkaloid biosynthetic pathway in Nicotiana benthamiana to produce a mixture of methoxylated and non&#8208;methoxylated alkaloid intermediates. Importantly, we show that the co&#8208;occurrence of both tryptamine and 5&#8208;methoxytryptamine substrates, along with the substrate promiscuity of downstream pathway enzymes, enable parallel formation of both methoxylated and non&#8208;methoxylated alkaloids.

         <title>Activation and C&#8722;C Coupling of Aryl Iodides via Bismuth Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic formation of C&#8211;C bonds from aryl halides is a highly attractive but unexplored area in the emerging field of bismuth redox catalysis. We report a chemoselective bismuth&#8208;photocatalyzed activation and coupling of (hetero)aryl iodides with pyrrole derivatives to forge C(sp2)&#8211;C(sp2) bonds via C&#8211;H functionalization. The bismuth complex features two different light&#8208;driven processes: an MLCT transition that promotes oxidative addition into Bi(I) and an LLCT&#8208;enabled homolytic cleavage of aryl&#8211;Bi(III) bonds.







Abstract
Within the emerging field of bismuth redox catalysis, the catalytic formation of C&#8722;C bonds using aryl halides would be highly desirable; yet such a process remains a synthetic challenge. Herein, we present a chemoselective bismuth&#8208;photocatalyzed activation and subsequent coupling of (hetero)aryl iodides with pyrrole derivatives to access C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2) linkages through C&#8722;H functionalization. This unique reactivity is the result of the bismuth complex featuring two redox state&#8208;dependent interactions with light, which 1) activates the Bi(I) complex for oxidative addition via MLCT, and 2) promotes the homolytic cleavage of aryl Bi(III) intermediates through a LLCT process.

         <title>Highly Strained, Fully &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Porphyrin Cyclophanes: Template&#8208;free Synthesis and Global Aromaticity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly strained porphyrin&#8208;based cyclophane (1) was synthesized using a template&#8208;free method starting from a porphyrin quinone (2). The neutral compound exhibits localized aromaticity, while its dicationic form demonstrates a combination of global aromaticity across the macrocycle and localized antiaromaticity within the porphyrin units.







Abstract
Porphyrin&#8208;based nanohoops, nanorings, and cages with fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures are highly sought after, but their synthesis remains challenging. Herein, we report the template&#8208;free synthesis of a highly strained, bithiophene&#8208;bridged porphyrin cyclophane (1) from a porphyrin quinone via a stereoselective nucleophilic addition followed by intermolecular Yamamoto coupling strategy. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses of 1 and its dication 12+ reveal significantly distorted cyclophane&#8208;like geometries, with calculated strain energies of 51.2 and 80.7&#8197;kcal/mol, respectively. While the neutral compound 1 exhibits localized aromaticity, the dication 12+ is globally aromatic, with the porphyrin unit displaying weak antiaromaticity. Additionally, the dication 12+ undergoes nucleophilic addition with chloride, relieving strain. This work presents a novel synthetic strategy for highly strained, fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems with intriguing electronic properties and chemical reactivity.

         <title>Stabilisation of a Strontium Hydride with a Monodentate Carbazolyl Ligand and its Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular strontium hydride was stabilised by a bulky monodentate ligand and arene co&#8208;ligands. Characteristic vibrations of the Sr2H2 core were identified and the reactivity patterns were studied with regard to addition, redox and base reactivity.







Abstract
The molecular strontium hydride 2 [(dtbpCbz)SrH(L)]2 (L=benzene, toluene) was isolated and stabilized by employing a sterically demanding carbazole ligand (dtbpCbz=1,8&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;ditertbutylphenyl)&#8208;3,6&#8208;ditertbutylcarbazolyl). Compound 2 was synthesized via phenylsilane metathesis with the corresponding amide (dtbpCbz)SrN(SiMe3)2 and characterized by 1H NMR, XRD and vibrational spectroscopy methods. We further investigated the stoichiometric reactivity of 2 towards carbon monoxide, azobenzene and trimethylsilylacetylene, showing three distinct reactivity pathways: addition, reduction and deprotonation. The reaction of 2 with carbon monoxide yields the ethenediolate complex 4 via addition, while with azobenzene reduction of the N&#8722;N double bond and release of hydrogen were observed, affording a heteroleptic strontium complex with a radical azobenzenyl ligand (5). The terminal alkyne is deprotonated by the hydride moiety to give the acetylide complex 6.

         <title>Propeller&#8208;Shaped Blatter&#8208;Based Triradicals: Distortion&#8208;Free Triangular Spin System and Spin&#8208;State&#8208;Dependent Photophysical Properties</title>

         <dc:description>
The synthesis and properties of propeller&#8208;shaped C3v&#8208; and Cs&#8208;symmetric triradicals are described. The triradicals were antiferromagnetic equilateral triangle spin systems with J/kB~&#8722;120&#8197;K, leading to the thermal equilibrium of the doublet/quartet states at room temperature. The spin&#8208;state&#8208;dependent absorption feature, spin&#8208;selective excitation, and spin&#8208;dependent excited&#8208;state dynamics are discussed.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis and properties of triptycene&#8208;based C3v&#8208; and Cs&#8208;symmetric stable triradicals. SQUID magnetometry showed the propeller&#8208;shaped triradicals were both an antiferromagnetic equilateral triangle spin system with small spin&#8208;spin interactions J/kB~&#8722;120&#8197;K and &#8722;106&#8197;K, leading to ca. 4/6 coexistence of the doublet/quartet states in thermal equilibrium at room temperature. The triradicals exhibited characteristic NIR absorption bands reaching 1000&#8197;nm, which was solely ascribed to the triradical in the doublet state by variable&#8208;temperature spectroscopic studies and quantum chemical calculations. Taking advantage of the spin&#8208;specific absorption feature, we found that the triradicals in the low&#8208;spin state undergo symmetry&#8208;breaking charge transfer, while those in the high&#8208;spin state fall into a monoradical&#8208;like excited state.

         <title>Independent LUMO Reactivity in Mesoionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Thiones: Synthesis of a Stable Radical Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a series of abnormal carbene&#8208;derived air&#8208;stable mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic thiones (mNHTs). The mNHTs showed independent LUMO reactivity, leveraging its positive charge. In particular, it resulted in the synthesis of a stable radical anion by chemical reduction of mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic thione.







Abstract
Mesoionic compounds, with positive and negative charges, are expected to have dual&#8208;site highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO, donor) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO, acceptor) reactivity. Herein, we report a novel class of air&#8208;stable mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic thiones (mNHTs) synthesized from abnormal N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (aNHCs). DFT studies revealed a highly polarized exocyclic thione moiety and computed Fukui function analysis suggests the dual&#8208;site HOMO/LUMO reactivity of mNHTs predicting donor property at the negatively charged &#8216;S&#8217; center while acceptor property at the cationic imidazole ring. The independent LUMO reactivity of the mNHT was realized by its chemical reduction to an elusive radical anion, which was characterized by a single crystal X&#8208;raydiffraction study. Further, we explore the reactivity of radical anion for the activation of SO2 gas, C&#8722;Br bonds of aryl bromide and photocatalytic functionalization of C&#8722;X (X = F, Br) bonds. This work unlocks the independent LUMO reactivity of a mesoionic compound.

         <title>Formation of H2O2 in Near&#8208;Neutral Zn&#8208;air Batteries Enables Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries with near&#8208;neutral electrolytes show promise as cheap, safe and sustainable devices but face slow charge kinetics. This study reveals a charge storage mechanism mediated by H2O2 formation during discharge and oxidation during charge, influenced by electrolyte composition and electrode material. Facile oxidation of H2O2 enables low overpotentials and suppresses carbon corrosion.







Abstract
Rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) with near&#8208;neutral electrolytes hold promise as cheap, safe and sustainable devices, but they suffer from slow charge kinetics and remain poorly studied. Here we reveal a charge storage mechanism of near&#8208;neutral Zn&#8208;air batteries that is mediated by formation of dissolved hydrogen peroxide upon cell discharge and its oxidation upon charge. This H2O2&#8208;mediated pathway facilitates oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at ~1.5&#8197;V vs. Zn2+/Zn, reducing charge overpotentials by ~0.2&#8211;0.5&#8197;V and mitigating carbon corrosion&#8212;a common issue in ZABs. The manifestation of this mechanism strongly depends on the electrolyte composition and positive electrode material, contributing up to ~60&#8201;% of the capacity with ZnSO4 solutions and carbon nanotubes. Enhancing the H2O2&#8208;mediated pathway offers a route to higher energy efficiency and durability in near&#8208;neutral ZABs, advancing practical, sustainable energy storage.

         <title>Modular Access to C2&#8217;&#8208;Aryl/Alkenyl Nucleosides with Electrochemical Stereoselective Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
C2&#8217;&#8208;modifications of nucleosides represent a key structural feature in many nucleoside&#8208;based therapeutics, though the development of efficient synthetic methodologies remains a significant challenge. This report introduces a modular and highly efficient approach for the C2&#8217;&#8208;arylation/alkenylation of nucleosides via electrochemical Ni&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile&#8208;coupling, which delivers excellent &#945;&#8208;stereoselectivity and broad functional group compatibility. Using this method, we synthesized a series of C2&#8217;&#8208;aryl&#8208;modified oligonucleotides that exhibited notable effects on DNA duplex melting temperatures (Tm), enhanced resistance to 3&#8217;&#8208;exonuclease degradation, and retained efficient cellular uptake.







Abstract
Chemically modified oligonucleotides have garnered significant attention in medicinal chemistry, chemical biology, and synthetic biology due to their enhanced stability in vivo compared to naturally occurring oligonucleotides. However, current methods for synthesizing modified nucleosides, particularly at the C2&#8217;&#8208;position, are limited in terms of efficiency, modularity, and selectivity. Herein, we report a new approach for the synthesis of highly functionalized C2&#8217;&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aryl/alkenyl nucleosides via an electrochemical nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of 2&#8217;&#8208;bromo nucleosides with a variety of (hetero)aryl and alkenyl iodides. This method affords a diverse array of C2&#8217;&#8208; &#945;&#8208;aryl/alkenyl nucleosides with excellent stereoselectivity, broad substrate scope, and good functional group compatibility. We further synthesized oligonucleotides incorporating C2&#8217;&#8208;aryl&#8208;modified thymidine moieties and demonstrated that their annealed double&#8208;stranded DNAs exhibit decreased melting temperatures (Tm). Additionally, oligonucleotides with C2&#8217;&#8208;aryl modifications at the 3&#8217; end showed enhanced resistance to 3&#8217;&#8208;exonuclease degradation and C2&#8217;&#8208;aryl modifications did not impede the cellular uptake process, highlighting the potential of these modified oligonucleotides for therapeutic applications.

         <title>Enantioselective Three&#8208;Component &#945;&#8208;Allylic Alkylation of &#945;&#8208;Amino Esters by Synergistic Photoinduced Pd/Carbonyl Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic photochemical Pd/carbonyl catalysis enables asymmetric &#945;&#8208;allylic alkylation of NH2&#8208;unprotected &#945;&#8208;amino esters with styrenes and alkyl bromides, affording an efficient new strategy for modular synthesis of quaternary &#945;&#8208;amino esters in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Photoinduced excited&#8208;state Pd catalysis has emerged as an intriguing strategy for unlocking new reactivity potential of simple substrates. However, the related transformations are still limited and the enantiocontrol remains challenging. Organocatalysis displays unique capability in substrate activation and stereocontrol. Combination of organocatalysis and photoinduced excited&#8208;state Pd catalysis may provide opportunities to develop new enantioselective reactions from simple substrates. By applying cooperative triple catalysis including excited&#8208;state Pd catalysis, ground&#8208;state Pd catalysis, and carbonyl catalysis, we have successfully realized enantioselective &#945;&#8208;allylic alkylation of &#945;&#8208;amino esters with simple styrene and alkyl halide starting materials. The reaction allows rapid modular assembly of the three reaction partners into a variety of chiral quaternary &#945;&#8208;amino esters in good yields with 90&#8211;99&#8201;% ee, without protecting group manipulations at the active NH2 group. The cooperation of the chiral pyridoxal catalyst and the chiral phosphine ligand accounts for the excellent chirality induction.

         <title>Dicyanocarbene&#8208;Induced Metal&#8208;Free Efficient Quinoidization for the Development of Fused N&#8208;Type Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new quinoidization reaction has been developed based on 2&#8208;(dimethylsulfaneylidene)malononitrile (DMSM). This reaction avoids the reliance on halogenated substrates and has unique reactivity to the electron&#8208;rich fused aromatics. Various new quinoidal compounds were synthesized, and one of them exhibits a high electron mobility up to 1.33&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Our results provide a new synthetic method to expand the library of high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type organic semiconductors.







Abstract
Dicyanomethylene&#8208;terminated quinoidal materials are promising n&#8208;type organic semiconductors featuring excellent electron mobilities and air stability. Traditional synthetic methods of these materials such as Takahashi reaction, require the use of expensive palladium catalyst and halogenated substrates. However, for electron&#8208;rich fused aromatic compounds, the poor stability after halogenation renders their halogenated derivatives unsuitable as reaction precursors. To address this issue, we present a new metal&#8208;free synthetic approach using 2&#8208;(dimethylsulfaneylidene)malononitrile as the quinoidization reagent, which is successfully applied to various electron&#8208;rich fused aromatic compounds, leading to the corresponding quinoidal compounds with high yields up to 94&#8201;%. We proposed the reaction mechanism, and investigated the physical properties of four fused quinoidal materials based on highly electron&#8208;rich fused aromatic compounds, which are scarce to be synthesized by the traditional method. Furthermore, these fused quinoidal materials were utilized in field&#8208;effect transistors, achieving high electron mobilities up to 1.33&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. We provide an effective synthetic approach to expand the library of high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule semiconductors.

         <title>Engineered Nanobodies Bind Bismuth, Indium and Gallium for Applications in Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Attaching metals to antibodies involves using bifunctional linkers that contain both a reactive and chelating group. This study eliminates the need for such linkers by incorporating the metal directly within a single&#8208;domain antibody. This is demonstrated for gallium, indium, and bismuth, addressing both diagnostic and therapeutic applications in positron emission tomography, single&#8208;photon emission computed tomography, and targeted alpha therapy.







Abstract
Targeted theranostics heavily rely on metal isotopes conjugated to antibodies. Single&#8208;domain antibodies, known as nanobodies, are much smaller in size without compromising specificity and affinity. The conventional way of conjugating metals to nanobodies involves non&#8208;specific modification of amino acid residues with bifunctional chelating agents. We demonstrate that mutagenesis of a single residue in a nanobody creates a triple cysteine motif that selectively binds bismuth which is, for example, used in targeted alpha therapy. Two mutations create a quadruple cysteine mutant specific for gallium and indium used in positron emission tomography and single&#8208;photon emission computed tomography, respectively. Labelling is quantitative within a few minutes. The metal nanobodies maintain structural integrity and stability over weeks, resist competition from endogenous metal binders like glutathione, and retain functionality.

         <title>Enantioselective [3+2] Annulation of Aldimines with Alkynes by Scandium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [3+2] annulation of readily accessible aromatic aldimines with internal alkynes via C&#8722;H activation has been achieved in an enantioselective fashion. A noncovalent C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction between a tert&#8208;Bu substituent on the chiral cyclopentadienyl ligand of a scandium catalyst and the phenyl ring of an aldimine substrate plays an important role in enhancing the enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The enantioselective [3+2] annulation of readily accessible aldimines with alkynes via C&#8722;H activation is, in principle, a straightforward and atom&#8208;efficient route for synthesizing chiral 1&#8208;aminoindenes, which are important components in a wide array of natural products, bioactive molecules, and functional materials. However, such asymmetric transformation has remained undeveloped to date due to the lack of suitable chiral catalysts. Here, we report for the first time the enantioselective [3+2] annulation of aldimines with alkynes via C&#8722;H activation using chiral half&#8208;sandwich scandium catalysts. This protocol enabled the synthesis of diverse multi&#8208;substituted chiral 1&#8208;aminoindene derivatives with 100&#8201;% atom&#8208;efficiency, broad substrate scope, and high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Density functional theory (DFT) analyses have revealed that a noncovalent C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction between a tert&#8208;Bu substituent in the chiral cyclopentadienyl (Cp) ligand and the phenyl ring of an aromatic aldimine substrate played an important role in achieving a high level of enantioselectivity. This work not only offers an efficient and selective route for synthesizing a new family of chiral 1&#8208;aminoindene derivatives but also offers unprecedented insights into enantioselectivity control in chiral Cp&#8208;ligated metal catalysts.

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive Aldehyde&#8208;Reduction Catalysis Through Catalyst Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light is an optimal stimulus to control the functioning of chemical systems, as it is clean, traceless, and easily applied. In this work we demonstrate a new way to couple catalytic activity to light input by encapsulating an aldehyde&#8208;reduction catalyst within a cage that opens upon illumination. This concept may enable illumination to be geared with catalytic activity for other reactions, including industrially relevant ones.







Abstract
We report a light&#8208;responsive tetrahedral metal&#8211;organic capsule that binds a perrhenate catalyst, which is released selectively upon irradiation with 350&#8197;nm light, turning on the catalytic reduction of organic carbonyls by hydrosilanes. The catalytic activity can be switched off by heating at 75&#8201;&#176;C for 2.5&#8197;h, which stimulates capsule reformation and catalyst re&#8208;encapsulation. Multiple on&#8208;off cycles were shown, with a clear relationship between product yield and light irradiation time. Encapsulation thus enables the coupling of light&#8208;responsiveness to catalysis in a manner that might be generalized to other catalysts and capsules.

&lt;p&gt;We report a light-responsive tetrahedral metal&#8211;organic capsule that binds a perrhenate catalyst, which is released selectively upon irradiation with 350&#8197;nm light, turning on the catalytic reduction of organic carbonyls by hydrosilanes. The catalytic activity can be switched off by heating at 75&#8201;&#176;C for 2.5&#8197;h, which stimulates capsule reformation and catalyst re-encapsulation. Multiple on-off cycles were shown, with a clear relationship between product yield and light irradiation time. Encapsulation thus enables the coupling of light-responsiveness to catalysis in a manner that might be generalized to other catalysts and capsules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mimicking the CO2&#8208;Bound State of the [Ni,Fe]&#8208;CO Dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through stepwise assembly the tailoring of complexes with NiII&#8208;(&#956;2&#8208;CO2)&#8208;MII entities (M=Fe, Co, Zn), resembling the structural motif found in an intermediate of the carbonmonoxide dehydrogenase, has been achieved. It was revealed that the transition metal ions reduce the reduction potential of the carbonite unit but increase its tendency to undergo C&#8722;O bond cleavage.







Abstract
Complexes, where a doubly reduced CO22&#8722; (carbonite) ligand is spanned between a nickel(II) centre and a transition metal(II) ion (TM=Fe, Co, Zn) have been accessed. In non&#8208;coordinating solvents the carbonite ligand exhibits a flexible coordination behaviour as observed by NMR spectroscopy and supported by DFT calculations. In particular the [Ni&#8208;CO2&#8208;Fe] representative replicates the respective entity in an intermediate formed during CO2&#8208;conversion by the enzyme [Ni,Fe]&#8208;CODH in many ways (structure, spectroscopic properties, reactivity). Our investigations reveal that transition metal ions reduce the reduction potential of the carbonite unit but increase its tendency to undergo C&#8722;O bond cleavage. This may explain the choice of an iron(II) ion instead of a s&#8208; or p&#8208;block&#8208;based Lewis acid as part of the active site.

         <title>Dication Disulfuranes as Photoactivatable Sources of Radical Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic dication disulfuranes release highly reactive isothiouronium radicals upon visible&#8208;light irradiation. These disulfuranes represent the first class of visible&#8208;light activatable reservoirs of radical organocatalysts in covalent radical catalysis, showing exceptional efficiency in the aerobic synthesis of 1,2&#8208;dioxolanes and 1,3&#8208;diketones under mild conditions.







Abstract
The recent development of photoredox and energy transfer catalysis has led to a significant expansion of visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven chemical transformations. These methods have demonstrated exceptional efficiency in converting a wide range of substrates into radical intermediates and generating open&#8208;shell catalytic species. However, the simplification of catalytic systems and the direct generation of highly reactive radical organocatalysts through direct visible&#8208;light irradiation from stable precatalysts remains largely an unrealized goal. This challenge is mainly due to the limited availability of precatalysts that are responsive to visible light. Herein, we introduce a new class of bench&#8208;stable dicationic disulfuranes, which release highly reactive thiyl radicals upon blue&#8208;light excitation. Spectroscopic and computational studies reveal that this reactivity arises from a combination of structural features and intermolecular interactions. This family of molecules has been employed to catalyze radical cascades previously incompatible with photoredox conditions, enabling the efficient formation of 1,2&#8208;dioxolanes and 1,3&#8208;hydroxyketones in excellent yields and short reaction times.

         <title>Rapid, Non&#8208;Invasive, Accurate Diagnosis and Efficient Clearance of Metastatic Lymph Nodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile theranostic nanosystem (FLAGC) is reported for rapid, non&#8208;invasive, accurate diagnosis and efficient clearance of metastatic lymph nodes. FLAGC is easily drained to sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) for precise localization. FLAGC is then specifically lit up by the low pH and over&#8208;expressed myeloperoxidase (MPO) in the tumor microenvironment (TME), resulting in an accurate diagnosis of metastatic SLNs by chemical resonance energy transfer (CRET) luminescence in the second near&#8208;infrared window. Further, the tumor was efficiently eradicated through Ce6&#8208;mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT). Our findings offer a new paradigm for identifying and eliminating clinically positive lymph nodes.







Abstract
Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is currently the standard procedure for clinical cancer diagnosis and treatment, but still faces the risks of false negatives and tumor metastasis, as well as time&#8208;consuming pathological evaluation procedure. Herein, we proposed a near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) theranostic nanosystem (FLAGC) for rapid, non&#8208;invasive, accurate diagnosis and efficient clearance of metastatic lymph nodes in breast cancer. Initialized by chlorin e6 (Ce6), a pH&#8208;sensitive amphiphilic amino acid fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl&#8208;L&#8208;histidine (Fmoc&#8208;His) was assembled with Gd3+, luminol, and AgAuSe quantum dots (AAS QDs) to form FLAGC. In FLAGC, luminol and AAS QDs form a NIR&#8208;II chemical resonance energy transfer (CRET) system (Luminol&#8208;AAS); Ce6 initiates the assembly and also serves as a photosensitizer. Upon subcutaneous injection, FLAGC is easily drained into SLNs, achieving their precise localization. Subsequently, the acidity of tumor microenvironment triggers the rapid disassembly of FLAGC, exposing Luminol&#8208;AAS. myeloperoxidase (MPO) secreted by tumor&#8208;associated macrophages and neutrophils in SLNs mediates the oxidation of luminol, lighting up AAS QDs through the CRET process for precise diagnosis of metastatic lymph nodes. Moreover, highly efficient clearance of positive lymph nodes is achieved through Ce6&#8208;mediated photodynamic therapy. Our strategy provides a new paradigm for identifying and eliminating clinically metastatic lymph nodes.

         <title>Pooled Nanoparticle Screening Using a Chemical Barcoding Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aryl halide&#8208;based small molecule barcodes (halocodes) are used for pooled quantification of polymeric and liposomal nanoparticles in vitro and ex vivo. Halocodes are compatible with multiple classes of nanocarriers and have modular attachment, extensive parameter space, and low limits of detection with mass spectrometry&#8208;based technologies. This work demonstrates a promising new nanoparticle barcoding technology to expedite nanoparticle screening.







Abstract
We report the development of a small molecule&#8208;based barcoding platform for pooled screening of nanoparticle delivery. Using aryl halide&#8208;based tags (halocodes), we achieve high&#8208;sensitivity detection via gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry or electron capture. This enables barcoding and tracking of nanoparticles with minimal halocode concentrations and without altering their physicochemical properties. To demonstrate the utility of our platform for pooled screening, we synthesized a halocoded library of polylactide&#8208;co&#8208;glycolide (PLGA) nanoparticles and quantified uptake in ovarian cancer cells in a pooled manner. Our findings correlate with conventional fluorescence&#8208;based assays. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential of halocodes for spatial mapping of nanoparticles using mass spectrometry imaging (MSI). Halocoding presents an accessible and modular nanoparticle screening platform capable of quantifying delivery of pooled nanocarrier libraries in a range of biological settings.

         <title>Self&#8208;Immolative Polymers Derived from Renewable Resources via Thiol&#8211;Ene Chemistry
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Green thiol&#8208;ene: A thiol&#8208;ene reaction was employed to synthesize functionalizable self&#8208;immolative polymers from monomers derived from renewable aldehydes. Depolymerization occurred through an alternating 1,6&#8208;elimination and cyclization cascade after specific cleavage of responsive end&#8208;caps. The methoxy substituents on the syringaldehyde&#8208;derived polymer were critical in providing efficient depolymerization yet high background stability.







Abstract
The development of polymers from renewable resources is a promising approach to reduce reliance on petrochemicals. In addition, depolymerization is attracting significant attention for the breakdown of polymers at their end&#8208;of&#8208;life or to achieve specific stimuli&#8208;responsive functions. However, the design of polymers incorporating both of these features remains a challenge. Herein, we report a new class of self&#8208;immolative polymers based on lignin&#8208;derived aldehydes via a simple thiol&#8208;ene polymerization. These self&#8208;immolative polymers undergo cascade degradation in response to specific stimuli through alternating 1,6&#8208;elimination and cyclization reactions. The two methoxy substituents on the syringaldehyde monomer accelerated the desired depolymerization reaction, while enhancing stability against undesired backbone hydrolysis. Moreover, diverse responsive end&#8208;caps could be introduced through post&#8208;polymerization functionalization from a single polymer precursor.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Green thiol-ene&lt;/b&gt;: A thiol-ene reaction was employed to synthesize functionalizable self-immolative polymers from monomers derived from renewable aldehydes. Depolymerization occurred through an alternating 1,6-elimination and cyclization cascade after specific cleavage of responsive end-caps. The methoxy substituents on the syringaldehyde-derived polymer were critical in providing efficient depolymerization yet high background stability.

         <title>Photooxidation of Polyolefins to Produce Materials with In&#8208;Chain Ketones and Improved Materials Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a selective photooxidation of commodity and postconsumer polyolefins to produce materials with in&#8208;chain ketones without using catalysts or expensive oxidants. Under mild conditions, yields reached up to 1.23&#8197;mol&#8201;% of in&#8208;chain ketones, improving adhesion compared to unfunctionalized plastics. These ketones enable reaction with diamines, forming dynamic covalent polyolefin networks, upcycling mixed plastic waste into reprocessable materials with enhanced properties.







Abstract
Herein, we report a selective photooxidation of commodity postconsumer polyolefins to produce polymers with in&#8208;chain ketones. The reaction does not involve the use of catalyst, metals, or expensive oxidants, and selectively introduces ketone functional groups. Under mild and operationally simple conditions, yields up to 1.23&#8197;mol&#8201;% of in&#8208;chain ketones were achieved. Installation of in&#8208;chain ketones resulted in materials with improved adhesion of the materials and miscibility of mixed plastics relative to the unfunctionalized plastics. The introduction of ketone groups into the polymer backbone allows these materials to react with diamines, forming dynamic covalent polyolefin networks. This strategy allows for the upcycling of mixed plastic waste into reprocessable materials with enhanced performance properties compared to polyolefin blends. Mechanistic studies support the involvement of photoexcited nitroaromatics in consecutive hydrogen and oxygen atom transfer reactions.

         <title>Promoting Charge&#8208;Carriers Dynamics by Relaxed Lattice Strain in A&#8208;site&#8208;Doped Halide Perovskite for Photocatalytic H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;active alkali metal was doped into CsPbBr3, and the occupied locations were first revealed, which would change from A&#8208;site to interstitial site with K+ concentrations increased. Because of relaxed lattice strain, charge&#8208;carriers dynamics were promoted, leading to an ~11&#8208;fold enhancement of solar hydrogen generation rate for CsPbBr3 with K+ A&#8208;site doping.







Abstract
Because of the unique and superior optoelectronic properties, metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have attracted great interest in photocatalysis. Element doping strategy is adopted to modify perovskite materials to improve their photocatalytic performance. However, the contribution of bare doping&#8208;site onto photocatalytic efficiency, and the correlation between doping locations and activity have not yet to be demonstrated. The unique properties of non&#8208;active alkali metals promoted us to systematically explore the potential of A&#8208;site&#8208;doped MHPs for photocatalysis. Herein, we dope potassium (K+) into CsPbBr3 via an anti&#8208;solvent precipitation method and first reveal that the occupied locations of K+ in CsPbBr3 is lattice incorporation rather than surface segregation, which would change from A&#8208;site substitution to interstitial site in lattice with the increase of K+ concentrations. Taking hydrogen (H2) evolution as a model reaction, photocatalytic activity of CsPbBr3 after K+ doping could be significantly improved ~11&#8208;fold with A&#8208;site substitution, which is superior to that of interstitial site doping. Moreover, other alkali metals including lithium (Li), sodium (Na), and rubidium (Rb) doping give the same results. The structure of photocatalysts during reaction confirmed the contribution of A&#8208;site doping onto enhanced photocatalytic activity. Mechanistic insights show it is a result of the relaxed lattice strain induced promoted charge&#8208;carriers dynamics and upward shifting of band after K+ A&#8208;site doping.

         <title>Phenanthridine&#8208;based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting Overall Solar H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two neutral phenanthridine&#8208;containing covalent organic frameworks were constructed for the first time and exhibited boosting H2O2 photosynthetic activities. Introducing phenanthridine units realized one stone three birds: regulate the charge carrier dynamics, favor the reaction thermodynamics in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and water oxidation reaction (WOR) dual channels, and serve as photooxidation centers for 2e&#8722; WOR, thereby enhancing the overall solar H2O2 generation performance.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven H2O2 production via the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and water oxidation reaction (WOR) dual channels is green and sustainable but severely restricted by the sluggish reaction kinetics. Constructing intriguing photocatalysts with effective active centers is a shortcut to breaking the kinetic bottleneck with great significance. Herein, we synthesize two novel neutral phenanthridine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (PD&#8208;COF1 and PD&#8208;COF2) for photosynthesizing H2O2. Compared to the no phenanthridine counterpart (AN&#8208;COF), the H2O2 photosynthetic activities of PD&#8208;COF1 and PD&#8208;COF2 are markedly boosted. In air and pure water without sacrificial agents, under Xe lamp and natural sunlight, the H2O2 photogeneration rate of PD&#8208;COF2 is 6103 and 3646&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, respectively. Further experimental and theoretical inspections demonstrate that introducing phenanthridine units into COFs smoothly modulates the charge carrier dynamics and thermodynamically favors the generation of crucial OOH* and OH* intermediates in the ORR and WOR paths, respectively. Additionally, this is the first time the neutral phenanthridine moiety serves as the photooxidation unit for 2e&#8722; WOR towards H2O2 photoproduction. The current work sheds light on exploring novel catalytic centers for high&#8208;performance H2O2 evolution.

An integrated omnidirectional strategy for designing non&#8208;volatile solid additives was proposed, by employing this strategy, new solid additive PyMC5 was designed. Compared with its counterpart PyDC5, PyMC5 is capable of enhancing the photo&#8208;/thermal&#8208;stability of the device and boosting the power conversion efficiency of the binary OSC to 19.52&#8201;%, this result is among the best efficiencies reported so far.







Abstract
Solid additives have drawn great attention due to their numerous appealing benefits in enhancing the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs). To date, various strategies have been reported for the selection or design of non&#8208;volatile solid additives. However, the lack of a general design/evaluation principles for developing non&#8208;volatile solid additives often results in individual solid additives offering only one or two efficiency&#8208;boosting attributes. In this work, we propose an integrated omnidirectional strategy for designing non&#8208;volatile solid additives. By validating the method on the 4,5,9,10&#8208;pyrene diimide (PyDI) system, a novel non&#8208;volatile solid additive named PyMC5 was designed. PyMC5 is capable of enhancing device performance by establishing synergistic dual charge transfer channels, forming appropriate interactions with active layer materials, reducing non&#8208;radiative voltage loss and optimizing film morphology. Notably, the binary device (PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO) treated by PyMC5 achieved a PCE over 19.5&#8201;%, ranking among the highest reported to date. In addition, the integration of PyMC5 mitigated the degradation process of the devices under photo&#8208; and thermal&#8208;stress conditions. This work demonstrates an efficient integrated omnidirectional approach for designing non&#8208;volatile solid additives, offering a promising avenue for further advancements in OSC development.

Investigation into the hydrodecarboxylation mechanism reveals substrate&#8208;dependent modes of initiation under the conditions reported herein. Divergence in diastereomeric outcome is observed, with mechanistic probes elucidating key hydrogen&#8208;bonding and steric interactions.

         <title>Opening the Hysteresis Loop in Ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2 Nanosheets Through Functionalization with TCNQ Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasonic liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation of a layered ferromagnet, Fe3GeTe2, produces nanosheets with weak coercivity of ~0.1&#8197;T. The nanosheets react with an organic acceptor, TCNQ, to yield an FGT&#8208;TCNQ composite with a 5&#8208;fold increase in coercivity.







Abstract
Ferromagnetic metal Fe3GeTe2 (FGT), whose structure exhibits weak van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals interactions between 5&#8208;atom thick layers, was subjected to liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation (LPE) in N&#8208;methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) to yield a suspension of nanosheets that were separated into several fractions by successive centrifugation at different speeds. Electron microscopy confirmed successful exfoliation of bulk FGT to nanosheets as thin as 6&#8197;nm. The ferromagnetic ordering temperature for the nanosheets gradually decreased with the increase in the centrifugation speed used to isolate the 2D material. These nanosheets were resuspended in NMP and treated with an organic acceptor, 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyano&#8208;quinodimethane (TCNQ), which led to precipitation of FGT&#8208;TCNQ composite. The formation of the composite material is accompanied by charge transfer from the FGT nanosheets to TCNQ molecules, generating TCNQ&#8901;&#8722; radical anions, as revealed by experimental vibrational spectra and supported by first principles calculations. Remarkably, a substantial increase in magnetic anisotropy was observed, as manifested by the increase in the coercive field from nearly zero in bulk FGT to 1.0&#8197;kOe in the exfoliated nanosheets and then to 5.4&#8197;kOe in the FGT&#8208;TCNQ composite. The dramatic increase in coercivity of the composite suggests that functionalization with redox&#8208;active molecules provides an appealing pathway to enhancing magnetic properties of 2D materials.

         <title>Carbon Defects as Highly Active Sites for Gold Detection and Recovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon defects of carbon dot as an active sites for the reduction of gold. The formation of gold particles involves the formation of nano&#8208;gold nuclei (fast) and an Ostwald ripening process (slow). Importantly, this process occurs independently of interference from other ions, and self&#8208;settling is observed in this mechanism. This interplay between carbon defects and gold ions highlights a nuanced pathway for the creation of Au nanoparticles.







Abstract
The use of precious metals (PMs) in many areas, such as printed circuit boards, catalysts, and target drugs, is increasing due to their unique physical and chemical properties, but their recovery remains a great challenge in terms of zero&#8208;valent PMs as the final product. We report a highly hydrophilic carbon dot (CD) as a reductant (electron donor), in which the defects in CD served as efficient active sites for zero&#8208;valent PMs recovery with an electron&#8208;donating capacity of ~1.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1. The reduction of gold follows a two&#8208;step dynamic model characterized by the formation of nano&#8208;gold nuclei (initial rapid electron transfer process) followed by an Ostwald ripening process (subsequent slow process). Finite element method (FEM) simulation shows that the reaction efficiency and confinement effect of AuCl4&#8722; ions are positively correlated with defect density, indicating that the quantitative control of carbon defect density is the key to enhancing reduction activity. Combining density functional theory (DFT) with XPS and FTIR technology, we found that the electron is transferred from CD to Au(III) via hydrogen bonding. This nano carbon material can be exploited to recover gold from e&#8208;waste water directly, with the characteristics of reducing energy consumption and avoiding environmental pollution.

Abstract
Vaccines are one of the greatest human achievements in public health, as they help prevent the spread of diseases, reduce illness and death rates, saving thousands of lives with few side effects. Traditional vaccine development is centered around using live attenuated or inactivated pathogens, which is expensive and has resulted in vaccine&#8208;associated illnesses. Advancements have led to the development of safer subunit vaccines, which contain recombinant proteins isolated from pathogens. Their short half&#8208;life and small size make most subunit vaccines less immunogenic. Here, we introduce a large pore 2D covalent organic framework (COF), PyCOFamide, as a promising solution for an effective subunit platform. Our study demonstrates that simple adsorption of a model antigen, ovalbumin (OVA), onto PyCOFamide (OVA@COF) significantly enhances humoral and cell&#8208;mediated immune response compared to free OVA. OVA@COF exhibited heightened immune cell activation and acts as an antigen reservoir, facilitating antigen&#8208;presenting cell trafficking to the draining lymph nodes, amplifying the humoral immune response. Additionally, the breakdown of the COF releases monomers that adjuvant the activation of immune cells vital to creating strong immunity. This platform offers a potential avenue for safer, more effective subunit vaccines.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccines are one of the greatest human achievements in public health, as they help prevent the spread of diseases, reduce illness and death rates, saving thousands of lives with few side effects. Traditional vaccine development is centered around using live attenuated or inactivated pathogens, which is expensive and has resulted in vaccine-associated illnesses. Advancements have led to the development of safer subunit vaccines, which contain recombinant proteins isolated from pathogens. Their short half-life and small size make most subunit vaccines less immunogenic. Here, we introduce a large pore 2D covalent organic framework (COF), PyCOFamide, as a promising solution for an effective subunit platform. Our study demonstrates that simple adsorption of a model antigen, ovalbumin (OVA), onto PyCOFamide (OVA@COF) significantly enhances humoral and cell-mediated immune response compared to free OVA. OVA@COF exhibited heightened immune cell activation and acts as an antigen reservoir, facilitating antigen-presenting cell trafficking to the draining lymph nodes, amplifying the humoral immune response. Additionally, the breakdown of the COF releases monomers that adjuvant the activation of immune cells vital to creating strong immunity. This platform offers a potential avenue for safer, more effective subunit vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrafast Luminescence Detection with Selective Adsorption of Carbon Disulfide in a Gold(I) Metal&#8722;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel phosphorescent metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) exhibited a sensitive detecting ability for toxic carbon disulfide (CS2) with an ultrafast response time of 10&#8197;s at room temperature. Ex&#8197;situ time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence systems developed in this work demonstrated that the manipulation of energetic relaxation at the excited state with CS2 adsorption led to the luminescence response with outstanding visibility.







Abstract
Although a widely used and important industrial chemical, carbon disulfide (CS2) poses a number of hazards due to its volatility and toxicity. As such, the development of multifunctional materials for the selective capture and easy recognition of CS2 is one of the crucial issues. Herein, we demonstrate completely selective CS2 adsorption among trials involving H2O, alcohols, volatile organic compounds (including thiol derivatives), N2, H2, O2, CH4, CO, NO, and CO2. We also showcase its fine detection using remarkable luminescent response in a gold(I)&#8208;based metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF) of {ZnII(pz)[AuI(CN)2]2} (pz=pyrazine; 1) with a two&#8208;fold interpenetration network. Ex&#8197;situ single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction for 1 and CS2&#8208;accommodated 1 suggested that the Au&#8201;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8201;Au atoms are not only luminescent centers but also act as interaction sites for CS2 modulating the Au&#8201;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8201;Au contacts. These experiments revealed the specificity of CS2 and how changes in the CS2&#8208;induced structure. Based on the obtained structural transformation, 1 exhibited a sensitive detecting ability for CS2 with an ultrafast response time of less than 10&#8197;s. Moreover, ex&#8197;situ time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence analyses developed in this work implied that CS2 varied the energetic relaxation at the excited states related to the luminescent efficiency of the resultant MOF system.

         <title>Ultrafast Synthesis of IrB1.15 Nanocrystals for Efficient Chlorine and Hydrogen Evolution Reactions in Saline Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermetallic compounds of IrB1.15 have been successfully synthesized by ultrafast Joule heating at 900&#8201;&#176;C for a duration of 12&#8197;seconds, showcasing their robust electrocatalytic performance in acidic saline water media for both chlorine and hydrogen evolution reactions.







Abstract
The production of storable hydrogen fuel through water electrolysis powered by renewable energy sources such as solar, marine, geothermal, and wind energy presents a promising pathway toward achieving energy sustainability. Nevertheless, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrolysis requires support from ancillary processes which often incur financial and energy costs. Developing electrolysers capable of directly operating with water that contains impurities can circumvent these processes. Herein, we demonstrate the efficient and durable electrolysis of saline water to produce chlorine gas (Cl2) and hydrogen using structurally ordered IrB1.15, synthesized through ultrafast joule heating. IrB1.15 exhibits remarkable performance, achieving overpotentials of 75&#8197;mV for the chlorine evolution reaction (CER) and 12&#8197;mV for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) at current densities of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, IrB1.15 displays a durability of over 90&#8197;h towards both CER and HER. Density functional theory reveals that IrB1.15 has adsorption energies significantly closer to 0&#8197;eV for Cl and H, compared to IrO2 and Pt/C. Furthermore, in situ Raman investigations reveal that Ir in IrB1.15 serves as the active center for CER, while the introduction of B atoms to Ir lattices mitigates the formation of absorbed hydrogen species on the Ir surface, thereby enhancing the performance of IrB1.15 in HER.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Peptide&#8208;Derived Proteolysis&#8208;Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) Nanoparticles for Tumor&#8208;Targeted and Durable PD&#8208;L1 Degradation in Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

Self&#8208;assembled peptide&#8208;derived PROTAC nanoparticles (PT&#8208;NPs) are synthesized through peptide self&#8208;assembly, including anti&#8208;PD&#8722;L1 peptide, self&#8208;assembling linker and E3 ligase recruiter. The PT&#8208;NPs utilize multivalent binding for PD&#8722;L1&#8208;targeted endocytosis, effective degrading PD&#8722;L1 receptors in tumor cells via dual degradation mechanisms: direct lysosomal degradation and PROTAC&#8208;mediated degradation, offering a potent approach to cancer immunotherapy.







Abstract
Proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are a promising technique for the specific and durable degradation of cancer&#8208;related proteins via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system in cancer treatment. However, the therapeutic efficacy of PROTACs is restricted due to their hydrophobicity, poor cell permeability and insufficient tumor&#8208;targeting ability. Herein, we develop the self&#8208;assembled peptide&#8208;derived PROTAC nanoparticles (PT&#8208;NPs) for precise and durable programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8722;L1) degradation in targeted tumors. The PT&#8208;NPs with an average size of 211.8&#8197;nm are formed through the self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic peptide&#8208;derived PROTAC (CLQKTPKQC&#8208;FF&#8208;ALAPYIP), comprising a PD&#8722;L1&#8208;targeting &#8216;CLQKTPKQC&#8217;, self&#8208;assembling linker &#8216;FF&#8217; and E3 ligase recruiting &#8216;ALAPYIP&#8217;. Particularly, PT&#8208;NPs strongly bind to tumor cell surface PD&#8722;L1 to form PD&#8722;L1/PT&#8208;NPs complex, then internalized through receptor&#8208;mediated endocytosis and degraded in lysosomes. Second, free PROTACs released from PT&#8208;NPs to the cytoplasm further induce the durable proteolysis of cytoplasmic PD&#8722;L1 via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system. In colon tumor models, intravenously injected PT&#8208;NPs accumulate significantly at targeted tumor tissues through nanoparticle&#8208;derived passive and active targeting. At the targeted tumor tissues, PT&#8208;NPs promote durable PD&#8722;L1 degradation and ultimately trigger a substantial antitumor immune response. Collectively, this study provides valuable insights into the rational design of self&#8208;assembled peptide&#8208;derived PROTAC nanoparticles to ensure noticeable accuracy and enhanced efficacy in cancer treatment.

         <title>Spontaneous Emergence of Lipid Vesicles in a Coacervate&#8208;Based Compartmentalized System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We hereby present the generation of lipid vesicles under relatively low concentrations of lipid molecules (approximately 1&#8197;mM) and mild conditions within coacervate microdroplets. This finding suggests that analogous processes could have taken place on the early Earth, providing a novel perspective on the conditions conducive to the development of cellular systems. Additionally, our study highlights the importance of non&#8208;equilibrium thermodynamics in the formation of organized functional compartments. It elucidates that the binding energy between surfactants and oppositely charged components, which constitute the coacervate microdroplet, plays a pivotal role in governing the spatiotemporal distribution of surfactants within the coacervate microdroplet.







Abstract
The spontaneous emergence of lipid vesicles in the absence of evolved biological machinery represents a major challenge for bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology. We show that coacervate microdroplets could create a compartmentalized environment that enriches lipid molecules and facilitates their spontaneous assembly into lipid vesicles. These vesicles can escape from the coacervate microdroplets in a continuous process under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions, resembling a constant production process akin to a &#8220;primitive enzyme&#8221; factory assembly line. These findings significantly extend our understanding of the intricate interaction between lipid molecules and coacervate microdroplets, shedding light on the emergence of cellular systems and offering a new perspective on the conditions necessary for the development of life on Earth.

         <title>Photocatalytic Oxidative Coupling of Methane to Ethane Using CO2 as a Soft Oxidant over the Au/TiO2&#8722;Vo Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Construction of metal&#8208;support interface site by anchoring metal quantum dots on the oxide nanosheets to enhance the adsorption and activation of CO2, with efforts to achieve high&#8208;activity photocatalytic OCM to C2H6 with CO2 as a soft oxidant. M1 and M2 represent the metal atoms of the quantum dots and the oxide nanosheets, respectively.







Abstract
Photocatalytic oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) offers an appealing route for converting greenhouse gas into valuable C2 hydrocarbons. However, O2, as the most commonly used oxidant, tends to result in inevitable overoxidation and waste of methane feedstock. Herein, we first report a photocatalytic OCM using CO2 as a soft oxidant for C2H6 production under mild conditions, where an efficient photocatalyst with unique interface sites is designed and constructed to facilitate CO2 adsorption and activation, while concurrently boosting CH4 dissociation. As a prototype, the Au quantum dots anchored on oxygen&#8208;deficient TiO2 nanosheets are fabricated, where the Au&#8722;Vo&#8722;Ti interface sites for CO2 adsorption and activation are collectively disclosed by in situ Kelvin probe force microscopy, quasi in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. Compared with single metal site, the Au&#8722;Vo&#8722;Ti interface sites exhibit the lower CO2 adsorption energy and decrease the energy barrier of the *CO2 hydrogenation step from 1.05 to 0.77&#8197;eV via Au&#8722;C and Ti&#8722;O dual&#8208;site bonding. The adsorbed CO2 on the photocatalyst reduces the energy barrier of *CH4 dissociation to *CH3 from 2.13 to 1.59&#8197;eV, contributing to CH4 oxidation. Additionally, in situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy unveils the Au site facilitates ethane production by engaging in *CH3&#8722;Au interaction and accelerating CH3&#8722;CH3 coupling. Thus, the photocatalyst demonstrates a high C2H6 evolution rate of 2.60&#8197;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 for OCM using CO2 as the soft oxidant, surpassing most of previously reported photocatalysts regardless of OCM and nonoxidative coupling of methane. This work highlights the importance of soft oxidants for improving oxidation reaction efficiency and provides atomic scale insight into the design of photocatalysts for CH4 conversion.

         <title>Precision Activity&#8208;Based &#945;&#8208;Amylase Probes for Dissection and Annotation of Linear and Branched&#8208;Chain Starch&#8208;Degrading Enzymes</title>

         <dc:description>
Activity&#8208;based probes were designed as a method to annotate substrate specificity of retaining &#945;&#8208;amylases. Fluorescent probes were used in activity&#8208;based protein profiling experiments with pure protein, a prominent gut microbe and in a species&#8208;rich composter sample. Proteomics experiments were performed to identify, and annotate the substrate specificity of, novel &#945;&#8208;amylases with favourable properties for the industrial processing of starch.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Amylases are the workhorse enzymes of starch degradation. They are central to human health, including as targets for anti&#8208;diabetic compounds, but are also the key enzymes in the industrial processing of starch for biofuels, corn syrups, brewing and detergents. Dissection of the activity, specificity and stability of &#945;&#8208;amylases is crucial to understanding their biology and allowing their exploitation. Yet, functional characterization lags behind DNA sequencing and genomics; and new tools are required for rapid analysis of &#945;&#8208;amylase function. Here, we design, synthesize and apply new branched &#945;&#8208;amylase activity&#8208;based probes. Using both &#945;&#8208;1,6 branched and unbranched &#945;&#8208;1,4 maltobiose activity&#8208;based probes we were able to explore the stability and substrate specificity of both a panel of human gut microbial &#945;&#8208;amylases and a panel of industrially relevant &#945;&#8208;amylases. We also demonstrate how we can detect and annotate the substrate specificity of &#945;&#8208;amylases in the complex cell lysate of both a prominent gut microbe and a diverse compost sample by in&#8208;gel fluorescence and mass spectrometry. A toolbox of starch&#8208;active activity&#8208;based probes will enable rapid functional dissection of &#945;&#8208;amylases. We envisage activity&#8208;based probes contributing to better selection and engineering of enzymes for industrial application as well as fundamental analysis of enzymes in human health.

Incorporating formamidinium iodide into zinc&#8208;iodine batteries regulates the solvation chemistry to enhance redox kinetics and suppress polyiodide dissolution for improved longevity.







Abstract
For rechargeable zinc&#8208;iodine batteries, the low electrical conductivity of iodine and the easy dissolution of polyiodide in the electrolyte need to be carefully managed to ensure efficient operation. Herein, we introduce an organic iodized salt, formamidinium iodide (CH5N2I), to modulate the solvation structure of iodide ion, aimed to improve the reaction kinetics of iodine for reversible redox conversion. The participation of formamidinium ion (FA+) into solvation structure leads to the formation of the favorable FAIZn(H2O)42+ complex, facilitating easier desolvation for redox conversion with iodine. Consequently, the inhibited formation of soluble polyiodide efficiently suppresses self&#8208;discharging and improves reversible redox conversion. Specifically, the fabricated battery demonstrates extraordinary cycling stability, with 90.1&#8201;% capacity retention after 10,000 cycles and high coulombic efficiency of 99.6&#8201;%. These results provide inspiring principles to develop organohalide materials for high&#8208;performance rechargeable batteries through the solvation modification and interface regulation strategies.

A degradable radical polymer cathode (co&#8208;PTN) is initially synthesized by copolymerizing 2,3&#8208;dihydrofuran with norbornene derivatives. The incorporation of nitroxide radicals in the side groups and enol ether linkage makes the polymer electrochemical stability and degradability under acidic treatment. The corresponding Li//co&#8208;PTN battery exhibits a high reversible capacity of 100.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a long cycle life of over 1000 cycles.







Abstract
Polymer&#8208;based organic electrodes for rechargeable batteries are attractive due to their design flexibility, sustainability, and environmental compatibility. Unfortunately, waste management of conventional polymer materials typically involves incineration, which emits greenhouse gases. Consequently, degradable polymers should be ideal candidates for future green batteries. However, to date, degradable polymer electrodes have been rarely reported. The few that have been developed exhibit very low capacities (&lt;40&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and poor cycle stability (&lt;100 cycles). Herein, we synthesize a degradable polymer cathode for lithium batteries by copolymerizing 2,3&#8208;dihydrofuran with TEMPO&#8208;containing norbornene derivatives. This polymer cathode demonstrates a two&#8208;electron redox reaction charge storage mechanism, exhibiting a high reversible capacity of 100.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a long cycle life of over 1000 cycles. Furthermore, under a mild acidic environment, this polymer electrode material undergoes complete decomposition via the hydrolysis of enol ethers, confirmed by gel permeation chromatography and matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometry. These encouraging results shed light on the design of degradable polymer electrodes.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Repaired Solvation Structure Strategy for High&#8208;Efficiency Phosphate&#8208;Based Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolytes in Potassium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the weak Lewis acidity of potassium ions, localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes in potassium&#8208;ion batteries are prone to excessive weak solvation. An entropic repair strategy is proposed for the solvation structure of potassium ions, and a high&#8208;entropy localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte with moderately weak solvation is systematically designed. The repaired electrolyte has high interface stability and ionic conductivity, and is nonflammable.







Abstract
The safety and cycling stability of potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are deeply associated with potassium&#8208;ion electrolytes. However, due to the weak Lewis acidity of potassium ions, localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes in PIBs are prone to excessive weak solvation. Herein, we propose an entropy repair strategy for the solvation structure of potassium ions and systematically design a moderately weakly solvated high&#8208;entropy localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte. The repaired electrolyte can achieve an average stable Coulombic efficiency of 99.4&#8201;% on the Cu collector surface. The potassium symmetric battery can be stably cycled for over 10000&#8197;h under a high current density of 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a large deposition capacity of 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The potassium metal pouch cell, using K1.92Fe[Fe(CN)6]0.94&#8901;0.5H2O as the cathode, maintains a capacity retention of 87.5&#8201;% after 2000 cycles at a current density of 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Even when the current density is increased tenfold from 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the battery still retains 67.1&#8201;% of its capacity. Additionally, due to the introduction of multiple solvents, the potassium metal battery with perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride as the cathode can maintain reversible capacities of 94.0 and 77.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and operate stably at ambient temperatures of &#8722;20 and &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, respectively.

         <title>Balancing Activity and Selectivity in Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction through First Coordination Shell Engineering in Cobalt Single Atom Catalysts</title>

Co single&#8208;atom sites with different N/O coordination are synthesized using a precursor preselection strategy to investigate their effect on selectivity and activity in the two&#8208;electron ORR. The trans&#8208;Co&#8208;N2O2 site achieves an optimal balance between selectivity and activity, reaching a H2O2 production rate of 12.86&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat.&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and an energy efficiency of 0.07&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat.&#8722;1&#8201;J&#8722;1 in a 100&#8208;hour flow&#8208;cell test.







Abstract
The electrochemical two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) offers a potentially cost&#8208;effective and eco&#8208;friendly route for the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). However, the competing 4e&#8722; ORR that converts oxygen to water limits the selectivity towards hydrogen peroxide. Accordingly, achieving highly selective H2O2 production under low voltage conditions remains challenging. Herein, guided by first&#8208;principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we show that modulation the first coordination sphere in Co single atom catalysts (Co&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts with Co&#8208;NxO4&#8208;x sites), specifically the replacement of Co&#8722;N bonds with Co&#8722;O bonds, can weaken the *OOH adsorption strength to boost the selectivity towards H2O2 (albeit with a slight decrease in ORR activity). Further, by synthesizing a series of N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported catalysts with Co&#8208;NxO4&#8208;x active sites, we were able to validate the DFT findings and explore the trade&#8208;off between catalytic activity and selectivity for 2e&#8722; ORR. A catalyst with trans&#8208;Co&#8208;N2O2 sites exhibited excellent catalytic activity and H2O2 selectivity, affording a H2O2 production rate of 12.86&#8197;

         <title>Regulated Li+ Solvation via Competitive Coordination Mechanism of Organic Cations for High Voltage and Fast Charging Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic cation with multiple cationic sites was introduced into electrolyte to attract solvent molecules and anions away from Li+ through electrostatic interactions resulting in enhanced Li+ transport kinetics and desolvation process.







Abstract
Li+ solvation exerted a decisive effect on electrolyte physicochemical properties. Suitable tuning for Li+ solvation enabled batteries to achieve unexpected performance. Here, we introduced inert organic cations to compete with Li+ for combining electrolyte molecules to modulate Li+ coordination in the electrolyte. The relevance between the number of cationic sites in organic cations and the competitive solvation ability was explored. The organic cations with multiple cationic sites attracted solvent molecules and anions away from Li+ to form new solvated shell, improving the Li+ transport kinetics and desolvation process in electrolyte while enhancing electrolyte oxidation tolerance. Moreover, electrostatic shielding provided by organic cations and anion&#8208;derived robust SEI promoted uniform and rapid Li+ deposition on Li electrodes. With the positive effect of organic cations, Li||LiCoO2 (LCO) batteries showed high specific capacity (136.46&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) at high charge/discharge rate (10&#8197;C). Furthermore, Li||LCO batteries exhibited good capacity retention (70&#8201;% after 500&#8197;cycles) at 4.6&#8197;V charge cut&#8208;off voltage. This work provides fresh insights for the optimization of electrolytes and battery performance.

         <title>Orientational Compatibility Modulation of Ligands in Low&#8208;Symmetry Multi&#8208;Cavity Discrete Coordination Cages by Neighbouring Cage Participation</title>

One&#8208;pot blending of a pair of tris&#8208;monodentate ligands and Pd(II) resulted in a mixed&#8208;ligated double&#8208;3D&#8208;cavity coordination cage, for the first time, as driven by orientational compatibility of ligand strands. Mixing Pd(II) with these ligands in separate&#8208;pots afforded homo&#8208;ligated cages where orientational compatibility of ligand strands is modulated by &#8220;neighbouring cage participation&#8221;.







Abstract
Complexation of Pd(II) with a designer unsymmetrical bis&#8208;monodentate ligand (2&#8201;:&#8201;4 ratio) yielded a specific Pd2L4 type &#8220;single&#8208;cavity discrete coordination cage&#8221; (SCDCC), from a pool of 4 isomeric structures. The observed selctivity is attributed to inherent orientational preference of the ligand strands around the metal centers. Crafting a short coordinating arm at either ends of the bis&#8208;monodentate ligand (i.e the longer&#8208;arm) produced a pair of unsymmetrical isomeric tris&#8208;monodentate ligands; whereas crafting the same short&#8208;arm at both ends of the ligand gives an unsymmetrical tetrakis&#8208;monodentate ligand. Complexation of Pd(II) with either of the isomeric tris&#8208;monodenate ligands (3&#8201;:&#8201;4 ratio) resulted in corresponding low&#8208;symmetry &#8220;multi&#8208;cavity discrete coordination cage&#8221; MCDCC having two conjoined cavities, though the inherent relative orientational preference of the longer arms is not achievable in these cages. The enforced orientation is sustained by &#8220;Neighbouring Cage Participation&#8221; (NCP). However, one&#8208;pot combination of Pd(II), with a mixture of isomeric tris&#8208;monodentate ligands in 3&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2 ratio produced an integratively self&#8208;sorted mixed&#8208;ligated MCDCC from a pool of 31 structures. Also, mixing Pd(II) with the tetrakis&#8208;monodentate ligand produced a MCDCC having three conjoined cavities. The inherent orientational preference of longer&#8208;arm of the ligand strands is retained in the mixed&#8208;ligated double&#8208;cavity and the homo&#8208;ligated triple cavity cages.

         <title>Guanidinium&#8208;Stapled Helical Peptides for Targeting Protein&#8208;Protein Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guanidinium&#8208;stapling is a versatile and straightforward macrocyclization strategy that is performed selectively on solid support by crosslinking two amino side chains. It does not only stabilize the helical structure of a peptide, but also adds a positive charge within the ring and can serve as a constrained mimic of arginine, thereby contributing to specific protein surface interactions, as demonstrated by several co&#8208;crystal structures with proteins of interest.







Abstract
Peptide stapling has emerged as a versatile approach in drug discovery to reinforce secondary structure elements especially &#945;&#8208;helices and improve properties of linear bioactive peptides. Inspired by the prevalence of arginine in protein&#8208;protein and protein&#8208;DNA interfaces, we investigated guanidinium&#8208;stapling as a means to constrain helical peptides. Guanidinium stapling was readily achieved on solid support, utilizing two orthogonally protected lysine or unatural &#945;&#8208;amino acid residues with an amino function. This method allows for easy modulation of the nature and size of the staple as well as helix propensity. Evaluating a set of guanidinium&#8208;stapled peptides for their interaction with different protein targets identified several binders with increased target affinity. X&#8208;ray structure determination of four complexes revealed that all stapled peptides adopt a helical conformation upon protein binding. Notably, the disubstituted guanidinium generally exhibits a distinct cis/trans conformation and, in one instance, retains a conserved hydrogen bond with the protein surface. By identifying, for the first time, the guanidinium moiety as an effective helical peptide stapling group, this research significantly expands the repertoire of &#945;&#8208;helix stapling techniques for the creation of useful protein mimics.

         <title>Chemical Upcycling of Thermoplastics Towards Thermosets Based on Dynamic Dimethylglyoxime&#8208;Urethane Moiety</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Current strategies for recycling thermoplastic polymer waste are economically unattractive and/or degenerative in the mechanical properties. Herein, we propose an economic strategy that can be used to reversibly transform the linear polymer waste towards crosslinked materials with reinforced mechanical properties.







Abstract
Huge annual consumption of thermoplastics results in the generation of large amounts of waste after their service life. Currently, the most popular recycling method based on mechanically melt&#8208;reprocessing deteriorates the material performance and is economically unattractive, which makes it unviable to be implemented in large scale. Herein, we present a chemical upcycling strategy that can transform dimethylglyoxime&#8208;urethane based thermoplastic waste into thermoset product with superior mechanical properties and higher economic values than the initial one. It is found that the dimethylglyoxime&#8208;urethane moiety has dynamic nature, endowing the material with open&#8208;loop upcycling ability. By removing the dimethylglyoxime segment via a simple sublimation process, the material structure is transformed from linear molecular into crosslinked network. More interestingly, the transformation is reversible, and the regenerated crosslinked network can be transformed back to linear molecule by returning the removed dimethylglyoxime segment to the material, which means the upcycled product can be recycled again after its service life. Our linear/crosslinked transformation strategy provide a new option for recycling thermoplastic waste.

         <title>Optical Control of TRPM8 Channels with Photoswitchable Menthol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed azo&#8208;menthol (AzoM), the first photoswitchable activator of the TRPM8 channel. AzoM enables precise and reversible optical control of TRPM8, facilitating detailed analysis of current kinetics. This allows for deeper insights into the specific roles of individual amino acids in channel gating, AzoM binding, and phosphoinositol&#8208;4,5&#8208;bisphosphate (PIP2) binding and sensitization.







Abstract
Transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8) channels are well known as sensors for cold temperatures and cooling agents such as menthol and icilin and these channels are tightly regulated by the membrane lipid phosphoinositol&#8208;4,5&#8208;bisphosphate (PIP2). Since TRPM8 channels emerged as promising drug targets for treating pain, itching, obesity, cancer, dry eye disease, and inflammation, we aimed at developing a high&#8208;precision TRPM8 channel activator, to achieve spatiotemporal control of TRPM8 activity with light. In this study, we designed, synthesized and characterized the first photoswitchable TRPM8 activator azo&#8208;menthol (AzoM). AzoM enables optical control of endogenously and heterologously expressed TRPM8 channels with UV and blue light which is demonstrated by performing patch&#8208;clamp experiments. Moreover, AzoM facilitates the reliable determination of activation, inactivation, and deactivation kinetics thereby providing further insights into the channel gating. Using AzoM, the specific roles of individual amino acids for AzoM or PIP2 binding and for sensitization by PIP2 can be elucidated. Altogether, AzoM represents as a high&#8208;precision pharmaceutical tool for reversible control of TRPM8 channel function that enhances our biophysical understanding of TRPM8 channels and holds the potential to support the development of novel pharmaceuticals.

The metalloenzyme [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase from Clostridium pasteurianum (&#8220;CpI&#8221;) can be utilized for electroenzymatic hydrogen production under ambient conditions and neutral pH. Mesoporous indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes have a hierarchical morphology with cavities and well&#8208;defined nanoparticle agglomerates, enhancing the electroenzymatic performance CpI.







Abstract
The metalloenzyme [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase is of interest to future biotechnologies targeting the production of &#8220;green&#8221; hydrogen (H2). We recently developed a simple two&#8208;step functionalized procedure to immobilize the [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase from Clostridium pasteurianum (&#8220;CpI&#8221;) on mesoporous indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes to achieve elevated H2 production with high operational stability and current densities of 8&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Here, we use a combination of atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) to understand how mesoporous ITO stabilizes and activates CpI for electroenzymatic H2 production. Examination of the topography and morphology of the mesoporous ITO surface revealed a hierarchical morphology containing cavities and well&#8208;defined nanoparticle agglomerates. Any potential effect of mesoporosity was investigated by comparing the stability and electroenzymatic activity of CpI on mesoporous &#8216;nanoITO&#8217; and planar ITO, where we determined that CpI has a higher turnover frequency and adsorbs with greater stability (with respect to electroenzymatic activity over time) to nanoITO surfaces.

         <title>Polymer Films&#8217; Residual Stress Attenuation from the Supramolecular Complexation with Ultra&#8208;Small Nanoparticles for High Resolution Nanoimprint Lithography</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of ultra&#8208;small nanoparticles can significantly alter the dynamics and physicochemical properties of polymers compared to colloid NPs due to their comparable sizes with characteristic lengths of polymer chain segment and the dense supramolecular interaction with polymers. This effect facilitates the fabrication of residual stress&#8208;free polymer films with high mechanical strengths, enabling unique application for low&#8208;cost, sub&#8208;2&#8197;nm resolution NIL.







Abstract
Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) has been broadly applied in the fabrication of nano&#8208;patterned polymer films for cost&#8208;efficiency and high through&#8208;put; however, the intrinsic tradeoff between mechanical strength and residual stress of polymer films significantly limits the NIL resolution while the harsh processing conditions limit its versatile applications to different substrates. Herein, 1&#8197;nm metal oxide cluster, phosphotungstic acid (PTA), is used to complex with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) for high&#8208;resolution NIL that can be operated at large&#8208;scale and mild conditions. The ultra&#8208;small size of PTA enables dense supramolecular interaction with PVA for the diminished crystallinity and accelerated chain dynamics that help relax the residual stress during film casting. Meanwhile, the PTAs serve as supramolecular crosslinkers for the increased modulus of the films (ca. 2&#8197;GPa), providing promising dimensional stability required for high&#8208;resolution NIL. Simple casting the aqueous blend on a master mold successfully gives a residual stress&#8208;free film with sub&#8208;2&#8197;nm resolution at wafer scale (&gt;100&#8197;cm2). The mild processing at ambient condition permits broad NIL applications to diverse substrates, e.g., integrated circuit chips, compact discs, PET nano gratings and even delicate bio&#8208;surfaces.

         <title>Controlled Helical Organization in Supramolecular Polymers of Pseudo&#8208;Macrocyclic Tetrakisporphyrins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrakisporphyrins with amino acid side chains adopt pseudo&#8208;macrocyclic conformations maintained by antiparallel hydrogen bonding. The (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;configurations of the stereogenic centers direct the pseudo&#8208;macrocyclic (M)&#8208; and (P)&#8208;conformations, respectively. The chirally twisted pseudo&#8208;macrocyclic (M)&#8208; and (P)&#8208;conformations direct the left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed helical supramolecular pseudo&#8208;polycatenane polymers, respectively.







Abstract
Tetrakisporphyrin monomers with amino acid side chains at each end form intramolecular antiparallel hydrogen&#8208;bonds to adopt chirally twisted pseudo&#8208;macrocyclic structures that result in right&#8208;handed and left&#8208;handed (P)&#8208; and (M)&#8208;conformations. The pseudo&#8208;macrocyclic tetrakisporphyrin monomers self&#8208;assembled to form supramolecular helical pseudo&#8208;polycatenane polymers via head&#8208;to&#8208;head complementary dimerization of the bisporphyrin cleft units in an isodesmic manner. The formation of one&#8208;handed supramolecular helical pseudo&#8208;polycatenane polymers was confirmed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The methyl and iso&#8208;propyl groups at the stereogenic center greatly enhanced the induced circular dichroism in the Soret bands of the supramolecular helical pseudo&#8208;polycatenane polymers. The induced CDs were reduced upon the introduction of large iso&#8208;butyl and tert&#8208;butyl groups. Atomic force microscopy revealed well&#8208;grown and long supramolecular helical pseudo&#8208;polycatenane polymer chains with chain lengths in the range of 361 to 13.6&#8197;nm. The right&#8208;handed helical chains were established by the self&#8208;assembly of the right&#8208;handed (P)&#8208;conformation of the pseudo&#8208;macrocyclic monomer.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Coordination Enhanced Metallopolymer Electrolytes for Wide&#8208;Temperature Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structurally novel polymer crosslinked by metal&#8211;organic coordination units (defined as metallopolymer) is designed and prepared to develop high&#8208;performance metal&#8211;organic coordination enhanced metallopolymer electrolytes (MPEs). By exploiting a Mo paddle&#8208;wheel complex as a tetratopic linker, the organic and inorganic moieties of polymer skeleton are integrated at molecular level, without phase separation and local inhomogeneity. The coordinatively unsaturated Mo&#8801;Mo units in Mo(II) paddle wheel complexes can serve as Lewis acid sites to effectively bind to bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide anions (FSI&#8722;), increase Li+ flux, and facilitate FSI&#8722; decomposition, resulting in uniform Li+ concentration gradients and the formation of stable fluorinated interfaces.







Abstract
The practical application of polymer electrolytes is seriously hindered by the inferior Li+ ionic conductivity, low Li+ transference number (tLi+), and poor interfacial stability. Herein, a structurally novel metallopolymer is designed and synthesized by exploiting a molybdenum (Mo) paddle&#8208;wheel complex as a tetratopic linker to bridge organic and inorganic moieties at molecular level. The prepared metallopolymer possesses combined merits of outstanding mechanical and thermal stability, as well as a low glass transition temperature (Tg &lt;&#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C). Based on this metallopolymer, an advanced metal&#8211;organic coordination enhanced metallopolymer electrolyte (MPE) is developed for constructing high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Due to the unsaturated coordination of Mo atoms, the uniformly distributed Mo&#8208;polyoxometalates (Mo&#8208;POMs) in metallopolymer skeleton can effectively immobilize anions (bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide anions, FSI&#8722;) and promote the dissociation of Li salts. Moreover, dynamic metal&#8211;organic coordination bonds endow the MPE with re&#8208;processability and self&#8208;healing, enabling it to accommodate electrode volume changes and maintain good interfacial contact. Consequently, the MPE achieves a competitive ionic conductivity of 0.712&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 (25&#8201;&#176;C), a high tLi+ (0.625), and a wide electrochemical stability window (&gt;5.0&#8197;V). This study presents a unique MPE design based on metal&#8211;organic coordination enhanced strategy, providing a promising solution for developing wide&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state LMBs.

         <title>Theory&#8208;Guided Design of Unconventional Phase Metal Heteronanostructures for Higher&#8208;Rate Stable Li&#8208;CO2 and Li&#8208;Air Batteries</title>

A theory&#8208;guided design is proposed to promote the rational synthesis of unconventional phase 4H/face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) ruthenium&#8208;nickel heteronanostructures as efficient bifunctional catalysts for high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;CO2/air batteries. The assembled Li&#8208;CO2 and Li&#8208;air cells with unconventional phase metal heteronanostructures deliver excellent rate performance and cycling stability via tuning the discharge reaction path from Li2CO3 to Li2C2O4 at high rates.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;carbon dioxide (Li&#8208;CO2) and Li&#8208;air batteries hold great potential in achieving carbon neutral given their ultrahigh theoretical energy density and eco&#8208;friendly features. However, these Li&#8208;gas batteries still suffer from low discharging&#8208;charging rate and poor cycling life due to sluggish decomposition kinetics of discharge products especially Li2CO3. Here we report the theory&#8208;guided design and preparation of unconventional phase metal heteronanostructures as cathode catalysts for high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;CO2/air batteries. The assembled Li&#8208;CO2 cells with unconventional phase 4H/face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) ruthenium&#8208;nickel heteronanostructures deliver a narrow discharge&#8208;charge gap of 0.65&#8197;V, excellent rate capability and long&#8208;term cycling stability over 200 cycles at 250&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. The constructed Li&#8208;air batteries can steadily run for above 150 cycles in ambient air. Electrochemical mechanism studies reveal that 4H/fcc Ru&#8722;Ni with high&#8208;electroactivity facets can boost redox reaction kinetics and tune discharge reactions towards Li2C2O4 path, alleviating electrolyte/catalyst failures induced by the aggressive singlet oxygen from solo decomposition of Li2CO3.

         <title>Performance and Stability of Corundum&#8208;type In2O3 Catalyst for Carbon Dioxide Hydrogenation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rhombohedral polymorph of indium oxide performs better than the cubic one in terms of yield, selectivity, and stability for the carbon dioxide hydrogenation to methanol. The catalyst stability and sequence of transformation from rhombohedral to cubic to metallic indium is revealed in situ using synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction.







Abstract
Carbon dioxide hydrogenation to methanol is a key chemical reaction to store energy in chemical bonds, using carbon dioxide as an energy sink. Indium oxide is amongst the most promising candidates for replacing the copper and zinc oxide catalyst, which is industrially applied for syngas mixtures but less idoneous for educts with carbon dioxide due to instability reasons. The polymorph of indium oxide and the operating conditions remain to be optimized for optimal and stable performance. Indium oxide catalysts containing different rhombohedral and cubic phase ratios were synthesized using a solvothermal method and evaluated in an ideally mixed gas phase reactor. The pure rhombohedral catalyst shows the best performance in terms of yield to methanol, selectivity, and stability. The phase stability was assessed using synchrotron in situ XRD and Rietveld refinement, shedding light on the stability of the different phases at extended operating conditions. Depending on the flow rate, temperature, and hydrogen partial pressure, a rhombohedral to cubic transition occurs, ultimately yielding inactive metallic indium. If present, cubic In2O3 serves as nuclei to induce the cubic to rhombohedral transition, hampering performance. These results allow for a more rational catalyst design and fine&#8208;tuning of the operating conditions to ensure optimal and stable performance.

         <title>Modulating the Band Structure of Two&#8208;Dimensional Black Phosphorus via Electronic Effects of Organic Functional Groups for Enhanced Hydrogen Production Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that organic functional groups can modulate the band structure of two&#8208;dimensional black phosphorus (BP). By modifying BP&#8242;s surface, these groups alter charge density and shift band&#8208;edge positions, enabling continuous tuning of BP's valence and conduction bands. This approach achieves high hydrogen evolution reaction rates under visible light, offering a flexible, cost&#8208;effective strategy for enhancing BP&#8208;based photocatalysts.







Abstract
Electronic effects of organic functional groups play a fundamental role in determining the rate and/or direction of organic chemical reactions. The implementation of this concept in selective organic catalysis is achieved by tuning the electronic effects of organic functional groups to alter the corresponding reactivity. However, this approach has hardly been applied to modulate the band structure of inorganic materials. Here, we show that modulating the electronic band structure of two&#8208;dimensional black phosphorus (BP) is possible via the electronic effects of organic functional groups covalently modified on its surface. Organic functional group can either donate or withdraw charge density from BP surface, which will alter the bonding/anti&#8208;binding orbitals occupancy and thus shift the band&#8208;edge positions of functionalized BP downward/upward. Therefore, the valence&#8208;band maxima and the conduction&#8208;band minima of functionalized BP can be continuously tuned by changing the binding group with different Hammett parameters. Finally, unexpectedly high hydrogen evolution reaction rates under visible light are achieved using functionalized BP heterojunctions as photocatalysts. This work underscores the significant role of electronic effects in chemically controlling BP's band structure, offering greater flexibility and affordability beyond physical method limits.

         <title>Highly Selective On&#8208;Surface Dehydrogenative Aromatization of n&#8208;Hexyl to Phenyl Substituents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly selective dehydrogenative aromatization of n&#8208;hexyl groups on Au(111) surfaces has been achieved, yielding phenyl&#8208;substituted hexabenzocoronene. The transformation, involving sequential C&#8722;C bond rotations, dehydrogenation, and cyclodehydrogenation at C1 and C6, is confirmed by scanning probe microscopies and DFT calculations and is applicable to heteroatom&#8208;containing precursors.







Abstract
Dehydrogenative aromatization of alkyl substituents represents a powerful approach to aryl&#8208;substituted functional molecules. However, the inertness of alkyl groups and the need for harsh reaction conditions accompanied by low product selectivity hamper its widespread applications. Here, we demonstrate the highly selective on&#8208;surface thermal aromatization of n&#8208;hexyl substituents on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to their phenyl&#8208;substituted analogues under mild conditions. After depositing two representative precursor molecules, n&#8208;hexyl&#8208;substituted hexaphenylbenzene (HPB&#8208;Hex) and bianthryl octacarboxylic tetraimide (BATI&#8208;Hex), onto a pre&#8208;heated Au(111) substrate, dehydroaromatization of the peripheral n&#8208;hexyl groups into phenyl rings occurs, following the planarization of hexaphenylbenzene and bianthryl core. This process involves sequential intramolecular C&#8722;C bond rotations, dehydrogenation, and cyclodehydrogenation reactions, yielding phenyl&#8208;substituted hexabenzocoronene (HBC&#8208;Ph) and bisanthene octacarboxylic tetraimides (BSTI&#8208;Ph). The reaction sequences were monitored using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and bond&#8208;resolved non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM), offering structural proof of both intermediates and final products. These experimental techniques were complemented by density functional theory (DFT) simulations, which facilitated the detection of crucial steps in the conversion of n&#8208;hexyl to phenyl groups. Moreover, the effect of alkyl aromatization on the electronic properties of the newly formed aromatic hydrocarbons was elucidated using scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS).

This work has developed an in situ stimulus response strategy to minimize the influence of structural difference, obtained for the first time the gas&#8208;loading crystal structures of the same MOF before and after light/heat stimulus, directly observed the evolution of pore charge distribution and pore&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;gas interactions under light/heat induction, and finally summarized the favorable structure for highly efficient purification of C2H4.







Abstract
Efficient removal of acetylene (C2H2) impurities from polymer&#8208;grade ethylene (C2H4) in a simple, clean manner remains a challenging goal in industry. The use of porous materials such as metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is promising for this aim but the acquisition of high purification performance is still hindered by few knowledge on the purification process because the previous conclusions were derived basically from the non&#8208;breakthrough tests or ignored the influence of structural difference (crystal structure, morphology, or defect). Here we propose an unprecedented in situ stimulus response strategy to minimize the influence of structural difference, obtain the gas&#8208;loading crystal structures of the same MOF before and after light or heat stimulation, directly observe the evolution of pore charge distribution and pore&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;gas interactions under light/heat induction, and finally summarizes the favorable structure for highly efficient purification of C2H4. This study opens a new route to understand the relationship between the structure and separation performance for porous materials.

         <title>A Chiral COFs Membrane for Enantioselective Amino Acid Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct synthesis approach was employed to fabricate a homochiral covalent organic framework (COF) utilizing a well&#8208;defined chiral amine precursor. The resulting membrane exhibited exceptional enantioselectivity for racemic phenylalanine due to the uniform distribution of chiral recognition sites and a high degree of size matching between the chiral centers and the target molecule. This resulted in an enantiomeric excess value reaching 99.4&#8201;%.







Abstract
Incorporating chiral molecules in the covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with uniformly ordered pores results in chiral COFs, which have been highly promising candidates for enantioseparation. Herein, a homochiral COF nanochannel membrane is reported by introducing chiral centers (L&#8208;phenylalanine methyl ester) into one of the organic ligands for the enantioseparation of chiral amino acids. The separation results show that the D&#8208;isomer is preferentially transported through the porous membrane channel. This composite membrane exhibits excellent selectivity for racemic phenylalanine with the highest enantiomeric excess value of up to 99.4&#8201;%. The adsorption and molecular modeling studies substantiate the experiment results by showing higher bonding affinity towards D&#8208;isomer over L&#8208;isomer. The excellent enantioselective gating performance unveils the porous COF skeleton with chiral selectors and the size&#8208;matching synergy for stereoselective interactions with chiral isomers.

         <title>Atomically Asymmetrical Ir&#8722;O&#8211;Co Sites Enable Efficient Chloride&#8208;Mediated Ethylene Electrooxidation in Neutral Seawater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom Ir&#8208;substituted Co3O4 with an Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Co configuration (Ir1/Co3O4) was reported for the chloride&#8208;mediated ethylene oxidation reaction (EOR) in neutral seawater. The unique atomically asymmetrical Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Co configuration with a strong electron coupling effect accelerates electron transfer to increase the reaction kinetics and maintain structural stability, leading to high activity and stability for chloride&#8208;mediated EOR.







Abstract
The chloride&#8208;mediated ethylene oxidation reaction (EOR) of ethylene chlorohydrin (ECH) via electrocatalysis is practically attractive because of its sustainability and mild reaction conditions. However, the chlorine oxidation reaction (COR), which is essential for the above process, is commonly catalyzed by dimensionally stable anodes (DSAs) with high contents of precious Ru and/or Ir. The development of highly efficient COR electrocatalysts composed of nonprecious metals or decreased amounts of precious metals is highly desirable. Herein, we report a modified Co3O4 with a single&#8208;atom Ir substitution (Ir1/Co3O4) as a highly efficient COR electrocatalyst for chloride&#8208;mediated EOR to ECH in neutral seawater. Ir1/Co3O4 achieves a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of up to 94.8&#8201;% for ECH generation and remarkable stability. Combining experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the unique atomically asymmetrical Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Co configuration with a strong electron coupling effect in Ir1/Co3O4 can accelerate electron transfer to increase the reaction kinetics and maintain the structural stability of Co3O4 during COR. Moreover, a coupling reaction system integrating the anodic chloride&#8208;mediated and cathodic H2O2&#8208;mediated EOR show a total FE of ~170&#8201;% for paired electrosynthesis of ECH and ethylene glycol (EG) using ethylene as the raw material. The technoeconomic analysis highlights the promising application prospects of this system.

Vacancy engineered polymeric carbon nitride nanosheets were developed as highly efficient heterogeneous photocatalysts for the diverse functionalization of electronic&#8208;rich alkenes.







Abstract
Engineered polymeric carbon nitride represents a promising class of metal&#8208;free semiconductor photocatalysts for organic synthesis. Herein, we utilized engineered polymeric carbon nitride nanosheets, which exhibit an increased specific surface area and band gap due to enhanced quantum confinement from vacancy enrichment. These nanosheets serve as a heterogeneous organic semiconductor photocatalyst to facilitate diverse functionalizations of electron&#8208;rich alkenes, including arylsulfonylation, aminodifluoroalkylation, and oxytrifluoromethylation. This catalytic system operates under mild conditions, offering excellent functional group compatibility and high yields. Additionally, the catalyst demonstrates outstanding recyclability and efficiency in flow reactors, highlighting its significant potential for industrial applications.

         <title>Spherical DNA Nanomotors Enable Ultrasensitive Detection of Active Enzymes in Extracellular Vesicles for Cancer Diagnosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extracellular vesicle (EV)&#8208;encapsulated enzymes are promising biomarkers for cancer diagnosis. We report an enzymatically triggered spherical DNA nanomotor (EDM) that enables one&#8208;pot, cascaded, ultrasensitive activity analysis of EV&#8208;associated or free apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1). We demonstrate that more than 80&#8201;% of active APE1 in serum samples is EV&#8208;encapsulated, which exhibits high accuracy for early diagnosis of prostate cancer.







Abstract
Enzymes encapsulated in extracellular vesicles (EVs) hold promise as biomarkers for early cancer diagnosis. However, precise measurement of their catalytic activities within EVs remains a notable challenge. Here, we report an enzymatically triggered spherical DNA nanomotor (EDM) that enables one&#8208;pot, cascaded, and highly sensitive analysis of the activity of EV&#8208;associated or free apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1, a key enzyme in base excision repair) across various biological samples. The EDM capitalizes on APE1&#8208;triggered activation of DNAzyme (Dz) and its autonomous cleavage of substrates to achieve nonlinear signal amplification. Using EDM, we demonstrate a strong correlation between APE1 activity in EVs and that of their parental cancer cells. Additionally, EV APE1 mirrors the fluctuation of cellular APE1 activity in response to chemotherapy&#8208;induced DNA damage. In a pilot clinical study (n=63), the EDM&#8208;based assay reveals that more than 80&#8201;% of active APE1 in serum samples is EV&#8208;encapsulated. Notably, EV APE1 can differentiate early prostate cancer (PCa) patients from healthy donors (HDs) with an overall accuracy of 92&#8201;%, outperforming free APE1 in sera. We anticipate that EDM will become a versatile tool for quantifying EV&#8208;associated enzymes.

         <title>Band Engineering of Mn&#8208;P Alloy Enables HER&#8208;suppressed Aqueous Manganese Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A band structure regulation strategy is proposed to design a HER&#8208;suppressed MnP alloy anode for aqueous Mn metal batteries, where the severe HER primarily originates from the spontaneous Mn&#8208;H2O reaction driven by the high HOMO energy level and low electron escape work function of metallic Mn. Therefore, the MnP||AgVO full cell with an N/P ratio of 4 could deliver an extended cycle life (7000 cycles) with minimal capacity degradation (88.2&#8201;%).







Abstract
Aqueous manganese ion batteries hold potential for stationary storage applications owing to their merits in cost, energy density, and environmental sustainability. However, the formidable challenge is the instability of metallic manganese (Mn) anodes in aqueous electrolytes due to severe hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which is more serious than the commonly studied Zn metal anodes. Moreover, the mechanism of HER side reactions has remained unclear. Herein, we design a series of Mn&#8722;P alloying anodes by precisely regulating their energy band structures to mitigate the HER issue. It is found that the serious HER primarily originates from the spontaneous Mn&#8208;H2O reaction driven by the excessively high HOMO energy level of Mn, rather than electrocatalytic water splitting. Owing to a reduced HOMO energy level and enhanced electron escape work function, the MnP anode achieves an evidently enhanced cycle durability (over 1000&#8197;hours at a high current density of 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The MnP||AgVO full cell with an N/P ratio of 4 exhibits better rate capability and extended cycle life (7000 cycles) with minimal capacity degradation than the cell using metallic Mn anode (less than 100 cycles). This study provides a practical approach for developing highly durable aqueous Mn ion batteries

         <title>Selective Deuteration and Tritiation of Pharmaceutically Relevant Sulfoximines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report highly effective iridium&#8208;catalyzed methods for the installation of hydrogen isotopes into pharmaceutically&#8208;relevant sulfoximine&#8208;containing structures that can be conducted selectively via exchange at C(sp2)&#8208; and C(sp3)&#8208;centers. The utility of this catalytic platform has also been demonstrated through the late&#8208;stage and single step generation of labelled bioactive architectures and biomolecules.







Abstract
Pharmaceutical&#8208;aligned research endeavors continue to diversify, including via the installation of new chemical functionality and non&#8208;classical bioisosteres within drug design. With this, an equally high demand emerges for the direct installation of isotopic substituents into these scaffolds within drug discovery programmes, as isotopologues are essential for the elucidation of the biological efficacy and metabolic fate of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). The sulfoximine functional group has recently become established as a high&#8208;value unit in this context; however, general and effective methods for the synthesis of deuterium (2H, D) and tritium (3H, T) labelled analogues have remained elusive. Herein, we disclose the design and development of the first iridium&#8208;catalyzed sulfoximine&#8208;directed hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) systems that permit the site&#8208;selective integration of a distinguishing atomic label at aromatic C(sp2)&#8722;H and more challenging C(sp3)&#8722;H moieties. Moreover, we exemplify the broad applicability of these methods within a spectrum of molecular settings, as well as in the late&#8208;stage generation of isotopically&#8208;enriched complex bioactive architectures.

         <title>Affecting Charges and Structures of {Bi6} Architectures by 12&#8208;Electron Transition Metal Fragments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of the Zintl cluster [Bi6{Zn(hmds)}2]2&#8722; shows that the {Zn(hmds)} 12&#8208;electron fragment is perfectly suited for stabilizing a heretofore only theoretically predicted boat&#8208;type Bi64&#8722; unit. Comprehensive DFT calculations corroborate that fine&#8208;tuning of the charge and shape of {Bi6} moieties in heterometallic clusters are responsive to the nature of (electron&#8208;withdrawing) transition metal complex fragments coordinated by this unit.







Abstract
Molecules based on polyatomic bismuth substructures are currently attracting a lot of attention owing to this heavy and essentially non&#8208;toxic element's uncommon chemical and physical properties, which include unprecedented bonding properties. Hexaatomic {Bi6} substructures that underly more complex cluster structures were recently reported to adopt different structures or exhibit different structural details as a consequence of the charge of the {Bi6} unit. This leads to either crown&#8208;shaped cycles for a nominal Bi66&#8722; or differently distorted trigonal prisms for compositions close to Bi62&#8722;. It was predicted by quantum chemistry that Bi64&#8722; should adopt a distinctly distorted boat&#8208;like shape, yet a corresponding compound has remained elusive. Here, we report a proof of this assumption by the synthesis of [K(crypt&#8208;222)]2[Bi6{Zn(hmds)}2]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1.5THF (1), comprising a bimetallic [Bi6{Zn(hmds)}2]2&#8722; cluster that fulfills the prediction for the geometric and electronic structure of the missing link (crypt&#8208;222=4,7,13,16,21,24&#8208;hexaoxa&#8208;1,10&#8208;diazabicyclo&#8208;[8.8.8]hexa&#8208;cosane, hmds=hexamethyldisilazanid). A detailed quantum chemical study shows how the nature of Lewis&#8208;acidic transition metal complexes&#8212;in particular, 12&#8208;electron fragments&#8212;control and fine&#8208;tune the resulting {Bi6} architectures in accordance with the degree of electron&#8208;withdrawal from the polybismuthide core.

         <title>Autocatalysis&#8208;Integrated Bioorthogonal (Poly)Catalyst&#8208;Linked Immunosorbent Assay for Living Cell Membrane Antigens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed an autocatalysis&#8208;enhanced bioorthogonal catalyst&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (BCLISA). The method attaches polymer&#8208;based tris(triazolylmethyl)amine copper complex, catalyst of Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), to an antibody. Polytriazoles formed in the CuAAC reaction chelate Cu(I), speeding catalysis and boosting signal amplification. This technique effectively images live cell membrane antigens.







Abstract
Immunoassay methods, notably enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), renowned for their signal amplification capabilities, are extensively employed in scientific research and clinical diagnostics. However, the instability of enzymes and their sensitivity to cellular environments present significant challenges for the broad application of ELISA in living cells. In this work, we present a bioorthogonal (poly)catalysis&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (BCLISA) designed for the detection of cell membrane antigens, which involves coupling bioorthogonal catalysts based on small molecules or polymers to antibodies. After screening, we opted for the copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) as the core reaction system. The polymer&#8208;based catalysts exhibit enhanced reactivity at the same molecular concentration due to their multiple catalytic sites. Polytriazoles formed during the CuAAC reaction have the ability to chelate Cu(I), thereby promoting faster catalysis. By harnessing this autocatalytic feature, we successfully increased the signal amplification potential of BCLISA. Ultimately, this autocatalysis&#8208;integrated BCLISA technique was employed for antigen detection and imaging on both in vitro and living cell membranes. This approach offers a new method for the detection and imaging of low&#8208;abundance antigens on living cells.

         <title>Modulating Core Polarity in Metal&#8208;free Covalent Organic Frameworks for Selective Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of intermolecular polarity in metal&#8208;free covalent organic frameworks (COFs) on the selectivity of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electroproduction is highlighted in this study. By rationally modulating the core&#8216;s polarity of pyridine&#8208;containing imine&#8208;like COFs, we achieved 93.1&#8201;% selectivity and 90.5&#8201;% faradic efficiency for H2O2 production. This study paved the way for designing efficient and selective electrochemical H2O2 production catalysts.







Abstract
Tuning the charge density at the active site to balance the adsorption ability and reactivity of oxygen is extremely significant for driving a two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Herein, we have highlighted the influence of intermolecular polarity in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) on the efficiency and selectivity of electrochemical H2O2 production. Different C3 symmetric building blocks have been utilized to regulate the charge density at the active sites. The benzene&#8208;cored COF, which exhibits reduced polarity than the triazine&#8208;cored COF, displayed enhanced performance in H2O2 production, achieving 93.1&#8201;% selectivity for H2O2 at 0.4&#8197;V with almost two&#8208;electron transfer and a faradaic efficiency of 90.5&#8201;%. In&#8208;situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) were employed to confirm H2O2 generation and analyze spatial reactivity patterns. These techniques provided detailed insights into localized catalytic behavior, emphasizing the influence of core polarity.

         <title>Precise Photochemical Post&#8208;Processing of Molecular Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>

We report a method to fabricate molecular crystals of desired size and aspect ratio that capitalizes on their photochemical reactivity. The resulting crystals retain their physical properties and can be used to transduce light, among other applications requiring aspect ratios that are currently unavailable by crystallization approaches.







Abstract
Molecular crystals carry a great potential as new soft smart materials, with a plethora of recent examples overcoming the major obstacle of mechanical flexibility, and this research direction holds enormous potential to revolutionize optics, electronics, medicine, and space exploration. However, shaping organic crystals into desired shapes and sizes remains a major practical challenge due to the lack of control over the crystallization process, and the difficulties in mechanical post&#8208;processing without introduction of defects that are usually imparted by their soft nature. Here we present an innovative approach that employs photochemical processing for precise and nondestructive cutting of a molecular crystal. Our proposed method uses light to post&#8208;process crystals of the desired size and shape, similar to using light to cut other materials. This reaction induces strain, ensuring sharp cleavage without the need for melting or other processes. We further demonstrate the potential of this approach by producing crystals of arbitrary size, which can be used as controllable optical waveguides. Among other potential applications, this method can be used to prepare dynamic crystals, particularly those with aspect ratios crucial for mechanical deformation, such as flexible electronics, soft robotics, and sensing.

         <title>Fe&#8208;Catalyzed &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H Amination of N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron(II)&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;selective C&#8722;H amination of N&#8208;heterocycles is reported. It employs the N&#8208;heterocycle as the limiting reagent and presumably involves the formation of a reactive Fe&#8208;nitrene/imidyl radical species. This operationally simple method is amenable to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural products and APIs.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;heterocycles are privileged structures in both marketed drugs and natural products. On the other hand, C&#8722;H amination reactions furnish unconventional and straightforward approaches for the construction of C&#8722;N bonds. Yet, most of the known methods rely on precious metal catalysts. Herein we report a site&#8208;selective intermolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H amination of N&#8208;heterocycles, catalyzed by inexpensive FeCl2, which allows the functionalization of a wide range of pharmaceutically relevant cyclic amines. The C&#8722;H amination occurs site&#8208;selectively in &#945;&#8208;position to the nitrogen atom, even when weaker C&#8722;H bonds are present, and furnishes Troc&#8208;protected aminals or amidines. The method employs the N&#8208;heterocycle as limiting reagent and is applicable to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules. Its synthetic potential was further illustrated through the derivatization of &#945;&#8208;aminated products and the application to a concise total synthesis of the reported structure for senobtusin. Mechanistic studies allowed to propose a plausible reaction mechanism involving a turnover&#8208;limiting Fe&#8208;nitrene generation followed by fast H atom transfer and radical rebound.

         <title>Triplet Energy Gap&#8208;Regulated Room Temperature Phosphorescence in Host&#8211;Guest Doped Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regulation of triplet energy gap (&#916;ET) is introduced to construct the organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials. Here, the guest's triplet state can act as the &#8220;triplet energy reservoir&#8221;. A bidirectional energy transfer process, triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer (TTET) process and reverse triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer (rTTET) process, has proved in host&#8211;guest doped system. When &#916;ET is large, guest's triplet state collects the triplet excitons to emit RTP but returns triplet excitons to the host when &#916;ET is small.







Abstract
The organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials via host&#8211;guest doped method receive considerable attention in the fields of optoelectronics, bioimaging, and information encryption. Despite many host&#8211;guest doped materials with excellent RTP properties have been developed, their luminous mechanism is still limited. Here, a series of host&#8211;guest doped materials, using benzophenone as the host and quinone compounds as the guests, were constructed to investigate the effect of the triplet energy gap (&#916;ET) between the host and guest on triplet states population. The guest's triplet state is proposed to be a &#8220;triplet energy reservoir&#8221;, gathering the triplet excitons to emit RTP when &#916;ET is large and returning triplet excitons to the host when &#916;ET is small. By combining the results of steady&#8208;state and delayed emission spectra, time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectra, and theoretical calculations, a bidirectional energy transfer process is proved, which are triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer and reverse triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer processes. The thermal equilibrium of these two energy transfer processes can be regulated by the &#916;ET and temperature. The potential applications of these RTP properties are also realized in data encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. This work provides valuable insight into the design of host&#8211;guest doped materials based on energy transfer mechanisms.

         <title>Stabilisation of Bromenium Ions in Macrocyclic Halogen Bond Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first evidence of a macrocyclic effect for halenium (X+) ions is reported. Exploiting a series of bis&#8208;pyridine macrocycles, we demonstrate the selective endotopic complexation of Br(I) species, remarkably facilitating the isolation of a stable &#8216;Br+ NO3&#8722;&#8217; analogue and the first report of chemical ligand exchange reactions of Br(I) complexes. XRD studies of the macrocyclic Br(I) complexes and Ag(I) and Au(I) analogues provide rare insight concerning halenium vs. metal cation coordination behaviors.







Abstract
Halenium ions (X+) are highly reactive electron deficient species that are prevalent transient intermediates in halogenation reactions. The stabilisation of these species is especially challenging, with the most common approach to sequester reactivity through the formation of bis&#8208;pyridine (Py) complexes; [(Py)2X]+. Herein, we present the first example of a macrocyclic stabilisation effect for halenium species. Exploiting a series of bis&#8208;pyridine macrocycles, we demonstrate that preorganised macrocyclic ligands stabilise bromenium cations via endotopic complexation, impressively facilitating the isolation of a bench stable &#8216;Br+ NO3&#8722;&#8217; species. Solid state X&#8208;ray crystallographic structural comparison of macrocyclic Br(I) complexes with Ag(I) and Au(I) analogues provides insightful information concerning similarities and stark contrasts in halenium/metal cation coordination behaviors. Furthermore, the first chemical ligand exchange reactions of Br(I) complexes are reported between acyclic [(Py)2Br]+ species and a bis&#8208;pyridine macrocyclic donor ligand which importantly highlights a macrocycle effect for halenium cation stabilisation in the solution phase.

         <title>Surface Coordination Chemistry of Graphitic Carbon Nitride from Ag Molecular Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) is functionalized with organosilver probe molecules through a Surface OrganoMetallic Chemistry (SOMC) approach. In&#8208;depth characterization using high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF&#8208;STEM), X&#8208;ray absorption (XAS), and solid&#8208;state NMR (ssNMR) spectroscopy reveal the dynamic processes during metal grafting to generate three distinct surface sites: bis&#8208;NHC&#8208;Ag+, dispersed Ag+ sites, and physisorbed molecular precursor.







Abstract
Graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) has gained significant attention for its catalytic properties, especially in the development of Single Atom Catalysts (SACs). However, the surface chemistry underlying the formation of these isolated metal sites remains poorly understood. In this study we employ Surface OrganoMetallic Chemistry (SOMC) together with advanced microscopic and spectroscopic techniques for an in&#8208;depth analysis of functionalized g&#8208;C3N4 materials, where tailored organosilver probe molecules are used to monitor surface processes and characterize resulting surface species. A multi&#8208;technique approach &#8211; including high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF&#8208;STEM), X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and multinuclear solid&#8208;state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (ssNMR), coupled with density functional theory (DFT) calculations &#8211; identifies three primary surface species in Ag&#8208;functionalized g&#8208;C3N4: bis&#8208;NHC&#8208;Ag+, dispersed Ag+ sites, and physisorbed molecular precursor. These findings highlight a dynamic grafting process and provide insights into the surface coordination chemistry of functionalized g&#8208;C3N4 materials.

         <title>Tailoring d&#8208;Band Center of Single&#8208;Atom Nickel Sites for Boosted Photocatalytic Reduction of Diluted CO2 from Flue Gas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via coordination engineering of single&#8208;atom Ni sites in conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (CMOFs), Ni&#8208;O4 CMOFs features active sites of higher oxidation state and closer lying of d&#8208;band centers to the Fermi level than its Ni&#8208;N4 CMOFs counterpart, which favors the generation of *COOH key intermediate and the desorption of *CO, jointly resulting in significantly boosted performance for photoreduction of anthropogenic diluted CO2 from flue gas.







Abstract
Photocatalytic reduction of diluted CO2 from anthropogenic sources holds tremendous potential for achieving carbon neutrality, while the huge barrier to forming *COOH key intermediate considerably limits catalytic effectiveness. Herein, via coordination engineering of atomically scattered Ni sites in conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (CMOFs), we propose a facile strategy for tailoring the d&#8208;band center of metal active sites towards high&#8208;efficiency photoreduction of diluted CO2. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation in pure CO2, CMOFs with Ni&#8208;O4 sites (Ni&#8208;O4 CMOFs) exhibits an outstanding rate for CO generation of 13.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of 94.5&#8201;%, which is almost double that of its isostructural counterpart with traditional Ni&#8208;N4 sites (Ni&#8208;N4 CMOFs), outperforming most reported systems under comparable conditions. Interestingly, in simulated flue gas, the CO selectivity of Ni&#8208;N4 CMOFs decreases significantly while that of Ni&#8208;O4 CMOFs is mostly unchanged, signifying the supremacy for Ni&#8208;O4 CMOFs in leveraging anthropogenic diluted CO2. In situ spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) investigations demonstrate that O coordination can move the center of the Ni sites&#8242; d&#8208;band closer to the Fermi level, benefiting the generation of *COOH key intermediate as well as the desorption of *CO and hence leading to significantly boosted activity and selectivity for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO photoreduction.

         <title>Interweavable Metalloporphyrin&#8208;Based Fibers for Indirect Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of mechanically robust metalloporphyrin&#8208;based polymer fibers have been fabricated through an in situ polymerization strategy. These functional fibers with high strength and flexibility exhibit interweavable and designable functions that can be readily processed into different fiber forms like knotted, two&#8208;spiral, three&#8208;ply, five&#8208;ply fibers or interweaved networks that can be applied in efficient indirect electrocatalysis.







Abstract
The applications of indirect electrocatalysis toward potential industrial processes are drastically limited by the utilization or processing forms of electrocatalysts. The remaining challenges of electrocatalysts like the recycling in homogeneous systems or pulverization in heterogeneous systems call for advanced processing forms to meet the desired requirements. Here, we report a series of metalloporphyrin&#8208;based polymer fibers (M&#8722;PF, M=Ni, Cu and Zn) through a rigid&#8208;flexible polymerization strategy based on rigid metalloporphyrin and flexible thiourea units that can be applied as heterogeneous redox&#8208;mediators in indirect electrocatalysis. These functional fibers with high strength and flexibility exhibit interweavable and designable functions that can be processed into different fiber&#8208;forms like knotted, two&#8208;spiral, three&#8208;ply, five&#8208;ply fibers or even interweaved networks. Interestingly, they can be readily applied in S&#8722;S bond cleaving/cyclization reaction or extended oxidative self&#8208;coupling reaction of thiols with high efficiency. Remarkably, it enables the scale&#8208;up production (1.25&#8197;g in a batch&#8208;experiment) under laboratory conditions.

Ultra&#8208;high energy density of 522&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and long&#8208;lifespan up to 178&#8197;cycles are achieved for lithium metal batteries just via using a three&#8208;component additive formula. The modifying electrolyte not only enhances the ionic conductivity significantly but also forms robust interfacial films on both electrodes, effectively suppressing electrolyte decomposition. Moreover, it ensures long&#8208;lasting and uniform Li+ regulation, contributing to exceptional cycle stability even under high voltage up to 5.0&#8197;V.







Abstract
Matching high&#8208;voltage cathodes with lithium metal anodes represents the most viable technological approach for developing secondary batteries with ultra&#8208;high energy density exceeding 500&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. Nevertheless, the instability of electrolyte/electrode interface film and commercial electrolytes with cut&#8208;off voltage above 4.3&#8197;V is still a major concern. Herein, we present that excellent cycling stability with an ultra&#8208;high cut&#8208;off voltage of up to 5.0&#8197;V can be obtained by using three&#8208;component additives containing fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), hexadecyl trimethylammonium chloride (CTAC), and tri(pentafluorophenyl)borane (TPFPB). Excellent ionic conductivity, robust interfacial films on both electrodes, and long&#8208;lasting uniform Li+ regulation ability can be obtained in the modifying electrolyte. Consequently, using a high plating/stripping capacity of 3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 under the current density of 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, lithium symmetric cells demonstrate stable cycling performance exceeding 800&#8197;hours. Meanwhile, the 7.3&#8197;Ah&#8208;class Li[NixCoyMn1&#8208;x&#8208;y]O2 (x=0.83, NCM83)|Li pouch cells are assembled, which show a high energy density of 522&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and present excellent stability over 178&#8197;cycles with a high initial coulombic efficiency (CE) of 98.0&#8201;%.

         <title>A Well&#8208;Coupled Supramolecular System Accelerates Photophosphorylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ATP energy synthesis is achieved by constructing the Fmoc&#8208;FF/g&#8208;C3N4/ATP synthase hydrogel. G&#8208;C3N4 as photocatalyst can be entrapped in the dipeptide Fmoc&#8208;FF hydrogel to catalyze and provide protons under light. Fmoc&#8208;FF can cooperate with g&#8208;C3N4 and contribute to the dispersion of catalysts to facilitate transmembrane proton gradient to drive ATP synthase located outside of the hydrogel for accelerated photophosphorylation.







Abstract
Supramolecular assembly allows multiple chemical/bio&#8208;components integrated as one system for cascade biochemical reactions. Herein the graphitic carbon nitrides (g&#8208;C3N4) as photocatalyst trapped in a dipeptide hydrogel covering adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase accelerates the photophosphorylation through ATP synthesis. Self&#8208;assembled N&#8208;fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl diphenylalanine (Fmoc&#8208;FF) as nanofibrils to allow g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets are embedded as a complex Fmoc&#8208;FF/g&#8208;C3N4 hydrogel. Fmoc&#8208;FF gel exhibits good electronic coupling with g&#8208;C3N4, which enables a photo&#8208;induced proton generation. The transmembrane proton gradient can be established by ATP synthase&#8208;lipid reconstituted on the surface of the Fmoc&#8208;FF/g&#8208;C3N4 hydrogel to enhance the ATP synthesis. It indicates that the Fmoc&#8208;FF/g&#8208;C3N4/ATP synthase&#8208;lipid film can possess a longer&#8208;term ATP production capability and allow repeated immersion for sustained ATP production. Such a hydrogel&#8208;supported ATP synthesis platform is achieved by a procedure at a larger scale.

         <title>Targeting Lysosomal Thiols for Immunogenic Cancer Cell Death</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We described reversible thiol binder 11, which accumulates in lysosomes of cancer cells, increases the level of ROS leading to their disruption and immunogenic cancer cell death. In murine sarcoma Nemeth&#8208;Kellner model, 11 extends the lifespan of the mice from 21 to 85&#8197;days and cures 40&#8201;% of mice. 11 induces the direct antitumor effect supported by humoral immune responses, as well as priming neutrophil's reaction against tumors.







Abstract
The number and stability of lysosomes (LYs) are different in cancer and healthy cells that makes them a possible target for cancer specific therapy. However, no LY&#8208;targeting drug is clinically approved yet. We describe in this paper a new therapeutic approach based on alkylation of lysosomal thiols in cancer cells by reversible thiol binder 11. The treatment with 11 increases the level of lysosomal reactive oxygen species leading to their destabilization, disruption and immunogenic cancer cell death. These effects are not observed in healthy cells. In murine sarcoma Nemeth&#8208;Kellner (NK)/Ly&#8208;RB model, 11 exhibits the spectacular therapeutic effect: it extends the lifespan of the treated mice from 21 to 85&#8197;days and cures 40&#8201;% of mice. The survived mice develop antibodies against tumor NK/Ly&#8208;RB cells. Their repeated challenge with the NK/Ly&#8208;RB cells results in 100&#8201;% mice survival compared to 0&#8201;% survival in the control group of na&#239;ve mice. Ex vivo data indicate that neutrophils in spleen of the cured animals are also involved in targeting cancer cells and produce neutrophil extracellular traps. In summary, 11 induces the direct antitumor effect supported by humoral immune responses, as well as priming neutrophil's reaction against tumors.

         <title>Non&#8208;selective Defect Minimization towards Highly Efficient Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Membranes for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have prepared a regulated ZIF membrane with reduced defect density owing to the confined growth of crystals between the top layer and substrate. Such a membrane provides a superior H2/N2 separation selectivity.







Abstract
The persistence of defects in polycrystalline membranes poses a substantial obstacle to reaching the theoretical molecular sieving separation and scaling up production. The low membrane selectivity in most reported literature is largely due to the unavoidable non&#8208;selective defects during synthesis, leading to a mismatch between the well&#8208;defined pore structure of polycrystalline molecular sieve materials. This paper presents a novel approach for minimizing non&#8208;selective defects in metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membranes by a constricted crystal growth strategy in a confined environment. The in situ ZIF formation using the densely packed seeding array between the substrate and the pre&#8208;grown top ZIF layer yields a confined membrane interlayer, which is highly uniform with a tightly packed crystalline structure. Unlike uncontrolled crystal growth, we purposely regulate the interlayer membrane growth in the direction parallel to the substrate. A notable 99&#8201;% decrease in defects in the confined interlayer was achieved compared to the random&#8208;grown top layer, leading to a ~353&#8201;% increment in H2/N2 selectivity over the non&#8208;confined reference MOF membrane. The performance of this new membrane sits in the optimal range above the Robeson upper bound. The membrane boasts a balanced high H2 permeability (&gt;5000 Barrer) and selectivity (&gt;50), significantly surpassing peer ZIF membranes.

         <title>A Mechanical Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Stiffens Tumor Cells to Potentiate Antitumor Immunity</title>

Mechanical immune checkpoint inhibitor (MICI), composed of synthetic cyclodextrin (CD) lipids and fusogenic lipids, can overcome the mechanical immune checkpoint by stiffening the tumor cells for enhanced tumor suppression. MICI fuses CD lipids into the tumor cell membrane to deplete the cholesterol from the plasma membrane, thereby improving NK and T cell&#8208;mediated antitumor effects.







Abstract
Tumor progression is associated with tumor&#8208;cell softening. Improving the stiffness of the tumor cells can make them more vulnerable to lymphocyte&#8208;mediated attack. Tumor cell membranes typically exhibit higher cholesterol levels than normal cells, making tumor cells soft. Herein, we demonstrate a mechanical immune checkpoint inhibitor (MICI) formulated by cyclodextrin (CD) lipids and fusogenic lipids. Through fusing CD lipids into the tumor cell membrane using a fusogenic liposome formulation, the cholesterol in the plasma membrane is reduced due to the specific host&#8211;guest interactions between CD lipid and cholesterol. As a result, tumor cells are stiffened, and the activation of lymphocytes (including NK and cytotoxic effector T cells) is improved when contacting the stiffened tumor cells, characterized by robust degranulation and effector cytokine production. Notably, this treatment has negligible influence on the infiltration and proliferation of lymphocytes in tumor tissues, confirming that the enhanced antitumor efficacy should result from activating a specific number of lymphocytes caused by direct regulation of the tumor cell stiffness. The combination of MICIs and clinical immunotherapies enhances the lymphocyte&#8208;mediated antitumor effects in two tumor mouse models, including breast cancer and melanoma. Our research also reveals an unappreciated mechanical dimension to lymphocyte activation.

A pair of spatially isolated donor (methoxyphenyl unit) and acceptor (anthraquinone unit) grafted to carbon nitride edges, which induce directional electron&#8208;hole transfer to the two spatially separated dual active centers. This process significantly facilitates the 2e&#8722; ORR and 4e&#8722; WOR. Moreover, anthraquinone units with strong proton extraction capacity boost the generation of *OOH intermediates and H2O2. In a continuous&#8208;flow self&#8208;Fenton reactor, the generated H2O2 can be efficiently activated into &#8901;OH radicals, enabling the rapid degradation and mineralization of various organic pollutants under solar irradiation.







Abstract
On&#8208;site H2O2 activation attracts much attention in energy conversion and environment remediation et&#8197;al., yet remains challenging in its highly efficient and sustainable synthesis. Herein, we grafted a pair of spatially isolated donor (methoxyphenyl unit) and acceptor (anthraquinone unit) in polymeric carbon nitride edges, which induce directional electron&#8208;hole transfer to the two spatially separated dual active centers. Specifically, photogenerated electrons in the anthraquinone unit facilitate the 2e&#8722; ORR, while the methoxyphenyl unit, which gathers photogenerated holes, enables rapid 4e&#8722; WOR. More impressively, the anthraquinone unit also exhibits strong proton extraction capabilities to boost the generation of *OOH intermediates and H2O2. Consequently, the synthesized donor&#8208;polymeric carbon nitride&#8208;acceptor (DPA) catalyst shows a remarkable H2O2 yield of 6497.1&#8197;&#956;M&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 in pure water, surpassing traditional DP and PA catalysts. Because of its high efficiency, the H2O2 product can efficiently degrade and mineralize various organic contaminants in a continuous&#8208;flow self&#8208;Fenton reactor under sunlight irradiation. Our work presents an unprecedented approach to designing photocatalysts with efficient H2O2 synthesis and practical application from a molecular engineering perspective.

         <title>A Metal Chelation Therapy to Effectively Eliminate Breast Cancer and Intratumor Bacteria While Suppressing Tumor Metastasis by Copper Depletion and Zinc Ions Surge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative metal chelation therapy is proposed to inhibit the growth of tumor and intratumor F. nucleatum through copper depletion and Zn2+ surge. Meanwhile, this therapy suppresses tumor metastasis through multiple routes, including the block of epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, activation of cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, and elimination with F. nucleatum.







Abstract
The intratumor microbiota results in the immunosuppressive microenvironment and facilitates tumor growth and metastasis. However, developing a synergistic therapy with antitumor, antibacterial, and antimetastatic effects faces enormous challenges. Here, we propose an innovative metal chelation therapy to effectively eliminate tumor and intratumor bacteria and suppress tumor metastasis. Different from traditional chelation therapy that only consumes metal elements, this therapy not only eliminates the crucial metal elements for tumor metabolism but also releases new metal ions with antitumor and antibacterial properties. Based on the high demand for copper in breast cancer, we prepare a fibrous therapeutic nanoagent (Zn&#8208;PEN) by chelating the copper chelator D&#8208;Penicillamine (D&#8208;PEN) with Zn2+. Firstly, Zn&#8208;PEN achieves dual inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis metabolism in breast cancer through copper depletion and Zn2+ activated cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, thus inducing tumor cell death. Secondly, Zn&#8208;PEN has the capability to eradicate Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) in breast cancer, thereby mitigating its immunosuppressive impact on the tumor microenvironment. Finally, Zn&#8208;PEN effectively inhibits tumor metastasis through multiple routes, including the inhibition of epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, activation of cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, and elimination with F. nucleatum. Therefore, we verify the feasibility of Zn&#8208;PEN mediated metal chelation therapy in a 4T1 model infected with F. nucleatum, providing a new therapeutic strategy for inhibiting tumor metastasis.

         <title>Promoting WLED&#8208;Excited High Temperature Long Afterglow by Orthogonally Anchoring Chromophores into 0D Metal&#8208;Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orthogonal anchoring of chromophores into 0D metal&#8208;organic cages to achieve high&#8208;temperature long afterglow emission. The afterglow emission of Cd&#8208;IDB&#8208;IPA reached 600&#8197;s after turning off the 365&#8197;nm UV lamp at 77&#8197;K, and the afterglow emission was still observed after being excited by WLED at 380&#8197;K.







Abstract
Afterglow materials have garnered significant interest due to distinct photophysical characteristics. However, it is still difficult to achieve long afterglow phosphorescence from organic molecules due to aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) and energy dissipation. In addition, most materials reported so far have long afterglow emission only at room or even low temperatures, and mainly use UV light as an excitation source. In this work, we report a strategy to achieve high temperature long afterglow emission through the assembly of isolated 0D metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs). In which, both ACQ and phosphorescence quenching effects are effectively mitigated by altering the stacking mode of organic chromophores through orthogonally anchoring into the edges of cubic MOCs. Furthermore, improvement in molecular rigidity, promotion of spin&#8208;orbit coupling and broadening of the absorption range are achieved through the MOC&#8208;engineering strategy. As a result, we successfully synthesized MOCs that can produce afterglow emission even after excitation by WLEDs at high temperatures (380&#8197;K). Moreover, the MOCs are capable of generating afterglow emissions when excited by mobile phone flashlight at room temperature. Given these features, the potential applications of MOCs in the visual identification of explosives, information encryption and multicolor display are explored.

         <dc:description>
Single atom Cu regulated Bi@C with Cu&#8211;C3 sites have been innovatively designed by the simple pyrolysis of metal&#8208;organic framework. The Cu&#8211;C3 sites can serve as both a modulator to catalyze the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich and powerful solid electrolyte interphase and a promoter to facilitate the adsorption and diffusion of Na+, which endow the sample with high&#8208;efficient sodium ion storage performance.







Abstract
Regulating interfacial chemistry at electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface by designing catalytic electrode material is crucial and challenging for optimizing battery performance. Herein, a novel single atom Cu regulated Bi@C with Cu&#8722;C3 site (Bi@SA Cu&#8722;C) have been designed via the simple pyrolysis of metal&#8208;organic framework. Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations indicate the Cu&#8722;C3 sites accelerate the dissociation of P&#8722;F and C&#8722;O bonds in NaPF6&#8208;ether&#8208;based electrolyte and catalyze the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich and powerful solid electrolyte interphase. In addition, the Cu&#8722;C3 sites with delocalized electron around Cu trigger an uneven charge distribution and induce an in&#8208;plane local electric field, which facilitates the adsorption of Na+ and reduces the Na+ migration energy barrier. Consequently, the obtained Bi@SA Cu&#8722;C achieves a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art reversible capacity, ultrahigh rate capability, and long&#8208;term cycling durability. The as&#8208;constructed full cell delivers a high capacity of 351&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 corresponding to an energy density of 265&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. This work provides a new strategy to realize high&#8208;efficient sodium ion storage for alloy&#8208;based anode through constructing single&#8208;atom modulator integrated catalysis and promotion effect into one entity.

&lt;p&gt;Single atom Cu regulated Bi@C with Cu&#8211;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; sites have been innovatively designed by the simple pyrolysis of metal-organic framework. The Cu&#8211;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; sites can serve as both a modulator to catalyze the formation of inorganic-rich and powerful solid electrolyte interphase and a promoter to facilitate the adsorption and diffusion of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, which endow the sample with high-efficient sodium ion storage performance.

         <title>Photoexcitation&#8208;Enhanced High&#8208;Ionic Conductivity in Polymer Electrolytes for Flexible, All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries Operating at Room Temperature</title>

         <dc:description>
Highly flexible, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries capable of operating at room temperature have been successfully constructed based on the photoexcitation modulation mechanism of heterojunctions fillers as well as the natural bacterial cellulose possessing excellent mechanical property and PEO compatibility. These innovations enable the lithium&#8208;metal pouch cell to achieve a high discharge capacity of 178.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even after repeated bending/folding, while maintaining superior cycling stability at a 1 C rate (25&#8201;&#176;C).







Abstract
Designing solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) with high ionic conductivity for room&#8208;temperature operation is essential for advancing flexible all&#8208;solid&#8208;state energy storage devices. Innovative strategies are urgently required to develop SPEs that are safe, stable, and high&#8208;performing. In this work, we introduce photoexcitation&#8208;modulated heterojunctions as catalytically active fillers within SPEs, guided by photocatalytic design principles, and meanwhile employ natural bacterial cellulose to improve the compatibility with poly(ethylene oxide), improve the coordination environment of lithium salts, and optimize both ion transport and mechanical properties. In situ photothermal experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the strong photogenerated electric field produced by trace heterojunctions within poly(ethylene oxide) electrolytes under photoexcitation significantly enhances lithium salt dissociation, increasing the concentration of mobile Li+. This results in a substantial increase in ionic conductivity, reaching 0.135&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C, with a Li+ transference number as high as 0.46. The flexible all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal pouch cells exhibit an impressive discharge capacity of 178.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even after repeated bending and folding, and demonstrate exceptional long&#8208;term cycling stability, retaining 86.7&#8201;% of their initial capacity after 250 cycles at 1&#8197;C (25&#8201;&#176;C). This research offers a novel approach to developing high&#8208;performance flexible lithium&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Elucidating Confinement and Microenvironment of Ru Clusters Stably Confined in MFI Zeolite for Efficient Propane Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrothermal in situ ligand protection combined with stepwise calcination in a flowing atmosphere has been effectively utilized to encapsulate Ru clusters within MFI zeolites. The interaction between the confined Ru clusters and the MFI framework induces local strain, creating a unique catalytic microenvironment. This synergistic interaction demonstrates exceptional activity and unparalleled stability in the deep oxidation of propane.







Abstract
Achieving active and stable heterogeneous catalysts by encapsulating noble metal species within zeolites is highly promising for high utilization and cost efficiency in thermal and environmental catalytic reactions. Ru, considered an economical noble metal alternative with comparable performance, faces great challenges within MFI&#8208;type microporous zeolites due to its high cohesive energy and mobility. Herein, an innovative strategy was explored that couples hydrothermal in situ ligand protection with stepwise calcination in a flowing atmosphere to embed ultrasmall Ru clusters anchored at K+&#8208;healed silanol sites (&#8801;Si&#8722;Ru&#948;+&#8722;O&#8722;K complexes) within 10&#8208;membered ring sinusoidal channels of MFI. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations unveiled that the interplay between confined Ru clusters and MFI induces local strain in MFI, creating a unique catalytic microenvironment around the Ru clusters. This synergy interaction enhances alkane deep oxidation as the confined Ru clusters and the MFI microenvironment collectively pre&#8208;activate C3H8 and O2, facilitate the cleavage of C&#8722;H and C&#8722;C bonds at low temperatures. Notably, the stable geometric and electronic properties of the confined Ru show exceptional thermal stability up to 1000&#8201;&#176;C, rivaling fresh catalysts. These findings shed vital methodological and mechanistic insights for developing efficacious heterogeneous catalysts for thermal catalysis.

The incorporation of multiple payloads within the same scaffold is a growing tendency in last generation Antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs). This paper reports the first strategy for the quadruple functionalization of therapeutic antibodies using four unique functionalities installed at four unique sites on the antibody. This is possible from multiple orthogonal site&#8208;specific protein modification strategies that result in highly homogeneous multi&#8208;functionalised antibody with retained affinity for the target.







Abstract
Antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs) are a growing class of chemotherapeutic agents that have yielded striking clinical successes. However, the efficacy of ADCs often suffers from issues associated with tumor heterogeneity and resistance. To overcome these problems, a new generation of ADCs comprising a single monoclonal antibody with multiple different payloads attached, termed multi&#8208;payload ADCs, have been developed. Here we deploy multiple orthogonal site&#8208;specific protein modification strategies to generate highly homogeneous multi&#8208;functionalised antibody conjugates comprising up to four different functionalities installed at four unique sites on the antibody. This work, which includes the use of a site&#8208;specific cyclopropenone (CPO)&#8208;based reagent, represents the first example of a homogeneous multi&#8208;payload ADC with a payload count greater than two, and thereby facilitates the development of the next generation of ADCs.

         <title>Building Ultrastrong, Tough and Biodegradable Thermoplastic Elastomers from Multiblock Copolyesters Via a &#8220;Reserve&#8208;Release&#8221; Crystallization Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong and tough thermoplastic materials are made available from biodegradable, naturally abundant lactides and lactones through facile polymer synthesis and processing, which features the well&#8208;defined segmented crystallizable chain architecture as the key to their broadly tunable mechanical properties controlled by block periodicity.







Abstract
Simultaneously attaining high strength and toughness has been a significant challenge in designing thermoplastic elastomers, especially biodegradable ones. In this context, we present a class of biodegradable elastomers based on multiblock copolyesters that afford extraordinary strength, toughness, and low&#8208;strain resilience despite expedient chemical synthesis and sample processing. With the incorporation of the semi&#8208;crystalline soft block and the judicious selection of block periodicity, the thermoplastic materials feature low quiescent crystallinity (&#8220;reserve&#8221;) albeit with vast potential for strain&#8208;induced crystallization (&#8220;release&#8221;), resulting in their significantly enhanced ultimate strength and energy&#8208;dissipating capabilities. Moreover, a breadth of mechanical responses of the materials &#8211; from reinforced elastomers to shape&#8208;memory materials to toughened thermoplastics &#8211; can be achieved by orthogonal variation of segment lengths and ratios.

     alt="Building Ultrastrong, Tough and Biodegradable Thermoplastic Elastomers from Multiblock Copolyesters Via a &#8220;Reserve-Release&#8221; Crystallization Strategy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong and tough thermoplastic materials are made available from biodegradable, naturally abundant lactides and lactones through facile polymer synthesis and processing, which features the well-defined segmented crystallizable chain architecture as the key to their broadly tunable mechanical properties controlled by block periodicity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously attaining high strength and toughness has been a significant challenge in designing thermoplastic elastomers, especially biodegradable ones. In this context, we present a class of biodegradable elastomers based on multiblock copolyesters that afford extraordinary strength, toughness, and low-strain resilience despite expedient chemical synthesis and sample processing. With the incorporation of the semi-crystalline soft block and the judicious selection of block periodicity, the thermoplastic materials feature low quiescent crystallinity (&#8220;reserve&#8221;) albeit with vast potential for strain-induced crystallization (&#8220;release&#8221;), resulting in their significantly enhanced ultimate strength and energy-dissipating capabilities. Moreover, a breadth of mechanical responses of the materials &#8211; from reinforced elastomers to shape-memory materials to toughened thermoplastics &#8211; can be achieved by orthogonal variation of segment lengths and ratios. This work and the &#8220;reserve-release&#8221; crystallization strategy herein highlight the double crystalline multiblock chain architecture as a potential avenue towards reconciling the strength-toughness trade-off in thermoplastic elastomers and can possibly be extended to other biodegradable building blocks to deliver functional materials with diverse mechanical performances.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reversible Hydrogen Acceptor&#8211;Donor Enables Relay Mechanism for Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
HxWO3 as a reversible hydrogen acceptor&#8208;donor is partnered with Cu to enable a relay mechanism for NITRR operated at E &gt;0 vs. RHE, which contains rapid H intercalation into HxWO3, prompt H de&#8208;intercalation from HxWO3 and transfer onto Cu and spontaneous H&#8208;mediated nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion on Cu. As a result, a high&#8208;efficiency NH3 production without competitive hydrogen evolution was achieved at record&#8208;low energy consumption.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction is a crucial process for sustainable ammonia production. However, to maximize ammonia yield efficiency, this technology inevitably operates at the potentials more negative than 0&#8197;V vs. RHE, leading to high energy consumption and competitive hydrogen evolution. To eradicate this issue, hydrogen tungsten bronze (HxWO3) as reversible hydrogen donor&#8208;acceptor is partnered with copper (Cu) to enable a relay mechanism at potentials positive than 0&#8197;V vs. RHE, which involves rapid intercalation of H into HxWO3 lattice, prompt de&#8208;intercalation of the lattice H and transfer onto Cu, and spontaneous H&#8208;mediated nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion on Cu. The resulting catalysts demonstrated a high ammonia yield rate of 3332.9&#177;34.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a Faraday efficiency of ~100&#8201;% at 0.10&#8197;V vs. RHE, displaying a record&#8208;low estimated energy consumption of 17.6&#8197;kWh&#8201;kgammonia&#8722;1. Using these catalysts, we achieve continuous ammonia production in an enlarged flow cell at a real energy consumption of 17.0&#8197;kWh&#8201;kgammonia&#8722;1.

         <title>Asymmetric Carbene Insertion into Se&#8722;S Bonds by Synergistic Rh(II)/Guanidine Catalysis Involving Chalcogen&#8208;Bond Assistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric carbene insertion into the Se&#8722;S bond of PhSeSCN under synergistic catalysis by a dirhodium salt and a chiral guanidine is reported. Various selenylthiocyanatopropanoates were prepared in good yields and enantioselectivity and exhibited excellent anti&#8208;inflammatory activity against IL&#8208;1&#946;. A new chalcogen&#8208;bond activation mode is disclosed.







Abstract
The efficient construction of chalcogen&#8208;atom&#8208;based chiral compounds remains a challenge, despite the importance of organoselenium and organosulfur compounds in life and materials science. Chalcogen atoms can form net attractive interactions called chalcogen bonds, but it is an undeveloped tool to assist asymmetric catalysis. Herein, we report an enantioselective insertion platform to install a stereogenic center bearing selenyl and thiocyano functional groups. Our method operates by synergistic catalysis by a chiral guanidine and an achiral dirhodium complex in a three&#8208;component or four&#8208;component reaction, through Se&#8722;S bond insertion into carbene species, competing successfully with the spontaneous racemic process and showing high regioselectivity. As elucidated by spectroscopic experiments and computational studies, a unique mechanism involving chalcogen as well as hydrogen bonding was established to account for the enantiocontrol. The high stereoselectivity holds for a broad array of selenylthiocyanatopropanoates, which showed excellent anti&#8208;inflammatory toward IL&#8208;1&#946; and low cytotoxicity.

         <title>Upcycling Polyethylene to High&#8208;Purity Hydrogen under Ambient Conditions via Mechanocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a mechanocatalytic route for upcycling polyethylene (PE) into high&#8208;purity hydrogen gas (H2, 99.4&#8197;vol&#8201;%) and metal carbides using ball milling at 45&#8201;&#176;C. Manganese (Mn) catalysts enable a remarkable H2 recovery ratio of 98.5&#8201;%. The resulting carbides, which do not promote hydrocarbons formation, further enhance H2 recovery ratio. This method provides an efficient pathway for converting PE to high&#8208;purity H2 under mild conditions.







Abstract
Polyethylene (PE) is the most abundant plastic waste, and its conversion to hydrogen (H2) offers a promising route for clean energy generation. However, PE decomposition typically requires high temperatures due to its strong chemical bonds, leading to significant carbon emissions and low H2 selectivity (theoretically less than 75&#8197;vol&#8201;% after accounting for further steam&#8208;reforming reactions). Here, we report a mechanocatalytic strategy that upcycles PE into high&#8208;purity H2 (99.4&#8197;vol&#8201;%) with an exceptional H2 recovery ratio of 98.5&#8201;% (versus 15.7&#8201;% via thermocatalysis), using manganese as a catalyst at a low temperature of 45&#8201;&#176;C. This method achieves a reaction rate 3 orders of magnitude higher than thermocatalysis. The marked improvement in H2 recovery ratio is mainly due to metal carbides formation induced by the mechanocatalytic process, which does not catalyze hydrocarbons formation. This work is expected to advance studies of the conversion of polyolefins to high&#8208;purity H2 with net&#8208;zero carbon emissions.

         <title>Photoelectrochemical Ethylene Glycol Oxidization Coupled with Hydrogen Generation Using Metal Oxide Photoelectrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we developed a BiVO4/NiCo&#8208;LDH photoanode for photoelectrochemical (PEC) oxidation of ethylene glycol (EG), achieving a faradic efficiency for formate production exceeding 85&#8201;% along with long&#8208;term stability. Additionally, we constructed an unassisted PEC tandem device that simultaneously facilitates EG oxidation and hydrogen generation by pairing the BiVO4/NiCo&#8208;LDH photoanode with a Cu2O photocathode.







Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting represents a promising approach for harnessing solar energy and transforming it into storable hydrogen. However, the complicated 4&#8208;electron transfer process of water oxidation reaction imposes kinetic limitations on the overall efficiency. Herein, we proposed a strategy by substituting water oxidation with the oxidation of ethylene glycol (EG), which is a hydrolysis byproduct of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic waste. To achieve this, we developed and synthesized BiVO4/NiCo&#8208;LDH photoanodes capable of achieving a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) exceeding 85&#8201;% for the oxidation of EG to formate in a strongly alkaline environment. The reaction mechanism was further elucidated using in situ FTIR spectroscopy. Additionally, we successfully constructed an unassisted PEC device for EG oxidation and hydrogen generation by pairing the translucent Mo&#8201;:&#8201;BiVO4/NiCo&#8208;LDH photoanode with a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Cu2O photocathode, resulting in an approximate photocurrent density of 2.3&#8197;mA/cm2. Our research not only offers a PEC pathway for converting PET plastics into valuable chemicals but also enables simultaneous hydrogen production.

However, the complicated 4-electron transfer process of water oxidation reaction imposes kinetic limitations on the overall efficiency. Herein, we proposed a strategy by substituting water oxidation with the oxidation of ethylene glycol (EG), which is a hydrolysis byproduct of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic waste. To achieve this, we developed and synthesized BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/NiCo-LDH photoanodes capable of achieving a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) exceeding 85&#8201;% for the oxidation of EG to formate in a strongly alkaline environment. The reaction mechanism was further elucidated using in situ FTIR spectroscopy. Additionally, we successfully constructed an unassisted PEC device for EG oxidation and hydrogen generation by pairing the translucent Mo&#8201;:&#8201;BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/NiCo-LDH photoanode with a state-of-the-art Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O photocathode, resulting in an approximate photocurrent density of 2.3&#8197;mA/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Our research not only offers a PEC pathway for converting PET plastics into valuable chemicals but also enables simultaneous hydrogen production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Silver&#8211;Isocyanide Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silver&#8211;carbon coordination&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks, which possess narrow band gaps down to 1.42&#8197;eV and well&#8208;defined crystalline two&#8208;dimensional staggered AB stacking structures, are rationally synthesized. The strong&#8208;polarized isocyanide groups not only provide a quasi&#8208;linear C&#8722;Ag&#8722;C coordination environment but also act as active carbon site for electrochemical catalysis.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been widely studied due to their versatile applications and easily tunable structures. However, heteroatom&#8208;metal coordination dominates the MOFs community, and the rational synthesis of carbon&#8211;metal coordination&#8208;based MOFs remains a significant challenge. Herein, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MOFs based on silver&#8211;carbon linkages are synthesized through the coordination between silver(I) salt and isocyanide&#8208;based monomers at ambient condition. The as&#8208;synthesized 2D MOFs possess well&#8208;defined crystalline structures and a staggered AB stacking mode. Most interestingly, these 2D MOFs, without &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking between layers, exhibit narrow band gaps down to 1.42&#8197;eV. As electrochemical catalysts for converting CO2 to CO, such 2D MOFs demonstrate Faradaic efficiency over 92&#8201;%. Surprisingly, the CO2 reduction catalyzed by these MOFs indicates favorable adsorption of CO2 and *COOH on the active carbon sites of the isocyanide groups rather than on silver sites. This is attributed to the critical &#963; donor role of isocyanides and the corresponding ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge&#8211;transfer effect. This work not only paves the way toward a new family of MOFs based on metal&#8211;isocyanide coordination but also offers a rare platform for understanding the electrocatalysis processes on strongly polarized carbon species.

         <title>Leveraging Ligand Desymmetrization to Enrich Structural Diversity of Zirconium Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Toxic Chemical Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By leveraging the ligand desymmetrization approach, a flexible tetratopic carboxylate ligand with a tetrahedral geometry was designed to construct four Zr&#8208;based MOF structures, in which the ligand configurations and Zr6 cluster connectivities can be controlled by varying solvents and modulators.







Abstract
The discovery of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with novel structures provides significant opportunities for developing porous solids with new properties and enriching the structural diversity of functional materials for various applications. The rational design of building units with specific geometric conformations is essential to direct the construction of MOFs with unique properties. Herein, we leverage a ligand desymmetrization approach to construct a series of new MOFs. A flexible tetratopic carboxylate ligand with a tetrahedral geometry was designed and assembled with a Zr6 cluster, generating four Zr&#8208;based MOF structures: NU&#8208;2600, NU&#8208;2700, NU&#8208;2800, and NU&#8208;1802, in which the ligand configurations and Zr6 cluster connectivities can be controlled by varying solvents and modulators during synthesis. Except for NU&#8208;1802, these represent entirely new topologies. Notably, NU&#8208;1802 exhibits structural flexibility, with up to a 74&#8201;% reduction in the unit cell volume as confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. Given their microporous structures, we studied the adsorption behaviors of n&#8208;hexane and 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfide to explore the structure&#8211;property relationships of these MOFs. Overall, this work highlights ligand desymmetrization as a powerful method to enrich MOF structural diversity and access complex MOFs with non&#8208;default topologies suitable for applications such as toxic gas capture.

         <title>[5]Helicene Based &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Macrocycles with Persistent Figure&#8208;Eight and M&#246;bius Shapes: Efficient Synthesis, Chiral Resolution and Bright Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple approach utilizing Suzuki coupling has led to the synthesis of a series of &#960;&#8208;conjugated chiral macrocycles with Figure&#8208;eight and M&#246;bius shapes. Their enantiomers exhibited impressive dissymmetry factors and high circularly polarized luminescence brightness, with |gabs| values up to 0.033, |glum| up to 0.038, and brightness reaching 710.5&#8197;M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1.







Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Conjugated chiral shape&#8208;persistent molecular nanocarbons hold great potential as chiroptical materials, though their synthesis remains a considerable challenge. Here, we present a simple approach using Suzuki coupling of a [5]helicene building block with various aromatic units, enabling the one&#8208;pot synthesis of a series of chiral macrocycles with persistent figure&#8208;eight and M&#246;bius shapes. Single&#8208;crystal structures of 7 compounds were solved, and 22 enantiomers were separated by preparative chiral HPLC. A notable pyrene&#8208;bridged figure&#8208;eight macrocycle, with its rigid, fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated and overcrowded structure, exhibited pure excimer emission and outstanding circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties, including a large dissymmetric factor (|glum|=3.8&#215;10&#8722;2) and significant CPL brightness (BCPL=710.5&#8197;M&#8722;1cm&#8722;1). This method provides a versatile synthetic platform for producing various chiral D2&#8208;symmetric figure&#8208;eight macrocycles and singly or triply twisted M&#246;bius macrocycles with C2 and D3 symmetry, offering tunable chiroptical properties for CPL applications.

Homogeneous distribution and ordered molecular orientation of SAM monolayers are critical to improving interfacial property and reducing interfacial losses. The novel graphdiyne derivative (PAG) with perfect hexagonal symmetry was successfully prepared to obtain low loss interface and high crystallization of perovskite film, which delivering an impressive high PCE of 26.10&#8201;% and enhanced operational stability.







Abstract
Perovskite solar cells with inverted architecture have remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) and operating stability based on self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs) hole transport layer. Homogeneous distribution and covalent binding mode of SAM monolayers are critical to improving interfacial property and reducing interfacial losses, which can be achieved through molecular design and co&#8208;assembly strategy. Here, we propose co&#8208;assembly strategy with SAM by employing a novel 2D &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure graphdiyne derivative (PAG) with phosphoric acid groups. Through the &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction and hydrogen bonding between PAG and SAM, the enhanced tridentate anchoring and highly ordered molecular orientation perpendicular to the substrate are successfully achieved. The improvement of interfacial characteristics further optimizes the crystalline quality and buried interface properties of perovskite films, allowing us to achieve a remarkable PCE of 26.10&#8201;% under standard illumination.

         <title>Upcycling of Polyamide Wastes to Tertiary Amines Using Mo Single Atoms and Rh Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyamides can be converted into tertiary amines in 100&#8201;% selectivity using Mo single atoms and Rh nanoparticles supported by TiO2. The described method provides an efficient way to convert polyamide waste into valuable nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds while retaining carboxylic acids.







Abstract
The pursuit of sustainable practices through the chemical recycling of polyamide wastes holds significant potential, particularly in enabling the recovery of a range of nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds. Herein, we report a novel strategy to upcycle polyamide wastes to tertiary amines with the assistance of H2 in acetic acid under mild conditions (e.g., 180&#8201;&#176;C), which is achieved over anatase TiO2 supported Mo single atoms and Rh nanoparticles. In this protocol, the polyamide is first converted into diacetamide intermediates via acidolysis, which are subsequently hydrogenated into corresponding carboxylic acid monomers and tertiary amines in 100&#8201;% selectivity. It is verified that Mo single atoms and Rh nanoparticles work together to activate both amide bonds of the diacetamide intermediate, and synergistically catalyze its hydrodeoxygenation to form tertiary amine, but this catalyst is ineffective for hydrogenation of carboxylic acid. This work presents an effective way to reconstruct various polyamide wastes into tertiary amines and carboxylic acids, which may have promising application potential.

         <title>Effective Proton Conduction in Quasi&#8208;Solid Zinc&#8208;Manganese Batteries via Constructing Highly Connected Transfer Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We proposed a novel electrolyte with proton transfer properties suitable for AZMBs. The Pr3+, propionic acid and montmorillonite construct connected proton transfer pathways synergistically, and the Pr3+ participates the interfacial electric double layer of manganese deposition and enhances its electrochemical activity. This water&#8208;poor quasi&#8208;solid hybrid electrolyte could maintain cycle stability while also stimulates high specific capacity.







Abstract
Elusive ion behaviors in aqueous electrolyte remain a challenge to break through the practicality of aqueous zinc&#8208;manganese batteries (AZMBs), a promising candidate for safe grid&#8208;scale energy storage systems. The proposed electrolyte strategies for this issue most ignore the prominent role of proton conduction, which greatly affects the operation stability of AZMBs. Here we report a water&#8208;poor quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte with efficient proton transfer pathways based on the large&#8208;space interlayer of montmorillonite and strong&#8208;hydration Pr3+ additive in AZMBs. Proton conduction is deeply understood in this quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte. Pr3+ additive not only dominates the proton conduction kinetics, but also regulates the reversible manganese interfacial deposition. As a result, the Cu@Zn||&#945;&#8208;MnO2 cell could achieve a high specific capacity of 433&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.4&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an excellent stability up to 800 cycles with a capacity retention of 92.2&#8201;% at 0.8&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in such water&#8208;poor quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte for the first time. Ah&#8208;scale pouch cell with mass loading of 15.19&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 sustains 100 cycles after initial activation, which is much better than its counterparts. Our work provides a new path for the development of zinc metal batteries with good sustainability and practicality.

         <title>Triflic Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrative Amination of 2&#8208;Arylethanols with Weak N&#8208;Nucleophiles in Hexafluoroisopropanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a catalytic deoxyamination of 2&#8208;arylethanols in hexafluoroisopropanol, which directly installs various amino groups, including sulfonamides, amides, ureas and anilines. The transformation relies on the intermediacy of a phenonium ion, whose formation was rationalized by mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations.







Abstract
The catalytic deoxyamination of readily available 2&#8208;arylethanols offers an appealing, simple, and straightforward means of accessing &#946;&#8208;(hetero)arylethylamines of biological interest. Yet, it currently represents a great challenge to synthetic chemistry. In most cases, the alcohol has to be either pre&#8208;activated in situ or converted into a reactive carbonyl intermediate, limiting the substrate scope for some methods. Examples of direct dehydrative amination of 2&#8208;arylethanols are thus still scarce. Here, we describe a catalytic protocol based on the synergy of triflic acid and hexafluoroisopropanol, which enables the direct and stereospecific amination of a broad array of 2&#8208;arylethanols, and does not require any pre&#8208;activation of the alcohol. This approach yields high value&#8208;added products incorporating sulfonamide, amide, urea, and aniline functionalities. In addition, this approach was applied to the sulfidation of 2&#8208;arylethanols. Mechanistic experiments and DFT computations indicate the formation of phenonium ions as key intermediates in the reaction.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembling 19F NMR probe disassembles upon interacting with various nucleotides in physiological conditions, activating the 19F signals and producing unique signatures for each analyte. This technique allows analysis in complex mixtures and facilitates real&#8208;time, in situ monitoring of enzymatic processes for quality control and assessment of inhibitory effects.







Abstract
Real&#8208;time monitoring of molecular transformations is crucial for advancements in biotechnology. In this study, we introduce a novel self&#8208;assembling 19F&#8208;labeled nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) probe that disassembles upon interaction with various nucleotides. This interaction not only activates the 19F signals but also produces distinct signatures for each specific component, thereby enabling precise identification and quantification of molecules in evolving samples. We demonstrate the capability of this probe for real&#8208;time monitoring of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis and screening potential enzyme inhibitors. These applications highlight the probe's significant potential in enzyme analysis, drug development, and disease diagnostics.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Ryanodane Diterpenoids Garajonone and 3&#8208;epi&#8208;Garajonone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;stage synthetic strategy inspired by terpene biosynthesis culminated in the first chemical synthesis of garajonone and its epimer. The rapid construction of the carbon framework using palladium&#8208;catalyzed reactions and selective redox manipulation offers a platform for the synthesis of further members of this complex family of ryanodane diterpenoids.







Abstract
Ryanodane diterpenes are structurally complex natural products that are well&#8208;known for their high degree of oxidation and the challenges associated with synthesizing them within the terpene class. Herein, we present a two&#8208;stage synthetic strategy that draws inspiration from the broad biosynthesis of terpenes, allowing us to achieve the first chemical synthesis of garajonone, a ryanodane diterpenoid that occurs naturally at low abundance, as well as its epimer, 3&#8208;epi&#8208;garajonone. The key to this success lies in the rapid construction of the carbon framework of the target molecule by employing an early&#8208;stage palladium&#8208;catalyzed Heck/carbonylative esterification cascade annulation, followed by successive late&#8208;stage selective redox manipulation to establish the desired oxidation state of the molecule. This research not only showcases the synthesis of garajonone and its epimer but also provides a platform for the chemical synthesis of other members and analogs of this complex diterpenoid family.

     alt="Total Synthesis of Ryanodane Diterpenoids Garajonone and 3-epi-Garajonone"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A two-stage synthetic strategy inspired by terpene biosynthesis culminated in the first chemical synthesis of garajonone and its epimer. The rapid construction of the carbon framework using palladium-catalyzed reactions and selective redox manipulation offers a platform for the synthesis of further members of this complex family of ryanodane diterpenoids.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ryanodane diterpenes are structurally complex natural products that are well-known for their high degree of oxidation and the challenges associated with synthesizing them within the terpene class. Herein, we present a two-stage synthetic strategy that draws inspiration from the broad biosynthesis of terpenes, allowing us to achieve the first chemical synthesis of garajonone, a ryanodane diterpenoid that occurs naturally at low abundance, as well as its epimer, 3-&lt;i&gt;epi&lt;/i&gt;-garajonone. The key to this success lies in the rapid construction of the carbon framework of the target molecule by employing an early-stage palladium-catalyzed Heck/carbonylative esterification cascade annulation, followed by successive late-stage selective redox manipulation to establish the desired oxidation state of the molecule. This research not only showcases the synthesis of garajonone and its epimer but also provides a platform for the chemical synthesis of other members and analogs of this complex diterpenoid family.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Deposition of organic acceptor molecules, 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ), on the surface of ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) nanosheets causes an unprecedented 5&#8208;fold increase in the coercivity of the FGT&#8208;TCNQ composite as compared to that of the bare nanosheets. This huge coercivity enhancement has been traced to the electron transfer from FGT to TCNQ that strengthens the interlayer magnetic exchange in FGT, as illustrated by Jos&#233; J. Baldov&#237;, Michael Shatruk et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202412425).

         <title>An Isolable Base&#8208;Stabilized Diazosilenyl Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an original reactivity of base&#8208;stabilized C&#8208;phosphonio&#8208;silyne with N2O allowing the synthesis of a base&#8208;stabilized diazosilenyl cation. This silicon analogue of diazoalkenes exhibits a remarkable stability thanks to ligand coordination. In addition, a particular stabilizing effect of the silicon atom of diazoalkene moiety was predicted by DFT calculations.







Abstract
In contrast to the emerging chemistry of stable diazoalkenes, there are not yet any studies devoted to heavier silicon analogues, diazosilenes. Here, we report the synthesis of a base&#8208;stabilized diazosilenyl cation 2 by the reaction of base&#8208;stabilized C&#8208;phosphonio&#8208;silyne 1 with N2O. This silicon analog of diazoalkenes 2 exhibits a remarkable stability thanks to the coordination of phosphine and phosphine oxide ligands at the cationic silicon center. In addition, DFT calculations predict that, due to a particular stabilizing effect of the electropositive silicon atom, for diazosilenes (R2Si=C=N2), the presence of &#960;&#8208;donor substituents is not essential to prevent N2 dissociation, contrary to carbon analogues. Interestingly, diazosilenyl cation 2 tends to isomerize into (silylene)(phosphonio)diazomethane 7 via a 1,2&#8208;phosphine ligand migration and thus exhibits dual reactivity as a diazoalkene and as a diazo&#8208;substituted silylene.

X&#8208;ray radiation&#8208;induced structural change of crystalline ZIF&#8208;8 films is investigated. Significant improvements in CO2&#8208;permeselectivity of ZIF&#8208;8 membranes using an X&#8208;ray treatment method are demonstrated for the first time.







Abstract
We report an X&#8208;ray radiation&#8208;induced modification of the structure and gas permeation behavior of ZIF&#8208;8 membranes. With 300&#8197;min irradiation time, CO2 permeance decreases by only 9&#8201;%, while N2 and CH4 permeances reduce by 75 and 65&#8201;%, respectively, leading to 3.7&#8208; and 2.6&#8208;fold enhancements in ideal selectivity for CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4.

         <title>A Carbazole&#8208;Centered Expanded Helicene Stabilized with Hexabenzocoronene (HBC) Units</title>

         <dc:description>
A carbazole&#8208;centered expanded tris&#8208;hexabenzo[7]helicene has been synthesized by a facile FeCl3&#8208;mediated Scholl coupling reaction. The significant structural expansion resulted in a pronounced redshift in fluorescence emission as well as enhanced chemical and chiral stability.







Abstract
The synthesis and stabilization of heteroatom&#8208;doped nanocarbon molecules, such as carbazole&#8208;containing (super)helicenes, present significant challenges due to the complexities involved in maintaining structural integrity and electronic functionality. In this study, we successfully synthesized a carbazole&#8208;centered expanded tris&#8208;hexabenzo[7]helicene (1) via a facile FeCl3&#8208;mediated Scholl coupling reaction. 1 exhibits both chemical and chiral stability and demonstrates fluorescence at 628&#8197;nm with a quantum yield of 0.40. Additionally, the enantiomers of 1 display pronounced chiroptical properties, including a distinct circular dichroism (CD) signal spanning from 300 to 600&#8197;nm. The absorption dissymmetry factor (|gabs|) is determined to be 2.98&#215;10&#8722;3, while the circularly polarized luminescence brightness (BCPL) is measured as 32.50&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Difluoroalkylation of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;Unsaturated &#945;&#8208;Amino Nitrile Derived Lithium Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed difluoroalkylation of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated &#945;&#8208;amino nitrile derived lithium reagents with various difluoroalkyl bromides has been developed. The rapid fluorine&#8208;editing of drugs demonstrates the synthetic versatility and utility of this protocol, showing the perspective in modern drug discovery.







Abstract
Organolithium reagents, known for their low cost, ready availability, and high reactivity, allow fast cross&#8208;coupling under ambient conditions. However, their direct cross&#8208;coupling with fluoroalkyl electrophiles remains a formidable challenge due to the easy formation of thermo&#8208;unstable fluoroalkyl lithium species during the reaction, which are prone to decomposition via rapid &#945;/&#946;&#8208;fluoride elimination. Here, we exploit heteroatom&#8208;stabilized allylic anions to harness the exceptional reactivity of organolithium reagents, enabling the compatibility of difluoroalkyl halides and facilitating versatile and precise fluorine functionality introduction under mild conditions.

This approach allows for the efficient and precise construction of secondary C(sp3)&#8722;CF2R bonds, previously challenging in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed fluoroalkylation reactions due to &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination. The rapid fluorine&#8208;editing of drugs demonstrates the synthetic versatility and utility of this protocol, showing the perspective in modern drug discovery.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organolithium reagents, known for their low cost, ready availability, and high reactivity, allow fast cross-coupling under ambient conditions. However, their direct cross-coupling with fluoroalkyl electrophiles remains a formidable challenge due to the easy formation of thermo-unstable fluoroalkyl lithium species during the reaction, which are prone to decomposition via rapid &#945;/&#946;-fluoride elimination. Here, we exploit heteroatom-stabilized allylic anions to harness the exceptional reactivity of organolithium reagents, enabling the compatibility of difluoroalkyl halides and facilitating versatile and precise fluorine functionality introduction under mild conditions. In this process, a nickel-catalyzed difluoroalkylation of &#946;,&#947;-unsaturated &#945;-amino nitrile derived lithium reagents (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-stabilized allyl lithium reagents) with various difluoroalkyl bromides has been developed, opening a new avenue to access fluorinated compounds through catalytic cross-coupling of organolithium reagents with fluoroalkyl electrophiles. This approach allows for the efficient and precise construction of secondary C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R bonds, previously challenging in transition-metal-catalyzed fluoroalkylation reactions due to &#946;-hydride elimination.

         <title>Characterization of Iminobismuthanes and Catalytic Reduction of Organic Azides via Bi(I)/Bi(III) Redox Cycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction between N,C,N&#8208;pincer bismuthinidenes and organic azides leads to isolation of elusive monomeric iminobismuthanes, which can be spectroscopically and crystallographically characterized. This novel reactivity led to the development of a protocol for the catalytic reduction of organic azides using pinacolborane (HBpin) under mild conditions.







Abstract
We report the stoichiometric and catalytic reactivity of organobismuth(I) complexes with organic azides. Treatment of N,C,N&#8208;pincer bismuthinidenes with organic azides (acyl, sulfonyl, and bulky aryl) results in monomeric iminobismuthanes which can be structurally characterized &#8212;including the formal Bi=N double bond&#8212; by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Building upon the stoichiometric reactivity of the monomeric iminobismuthanes, catalytic reduction of a broad range of organic azides is developed. DFT calculations of the catalytic reaction pathway support the redox nature of the overall process.

         <title>How to Easily Depolymerize Polyurethane Foam Wastes by Superbase Catalysts in Ionic Liquids Below 100&#8201;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel, sustainable, and scalable method for the efficient depolymerization of polyurethane foam waste is presented, employing ionic liquids and superbase catalysis as reaction media at 95&#8211;98&#8201;&#176;C, and highlighting the potential for industrial application of the resulting polyol.







Abstract
This study introduces a novel and sustainable approach using Ionic Liquids (ILs) as a non&#8208;innocent solvent that enhances the performance of the basic catalysts to depolymerize polyurethane foam wastes (PUFWs) through hydrolysis, alcoholysis or aminolysis under mild conditions. The system is stable, fully recoverable, and reusable. Hydrolysis of PUFWs can occur in just 2 minutes at 95&#8211;98&#8201;&#176;C, producing a white polyol that is easily separated and reused in new polyurethane synthesis. The method was successfully scaled up to depolymerize 200 g of PUFW per batch (1 kg overall depolymerization system). This scalability, combined with the medium&#8216;s reusability without loss of effectiveness, highlights its strong potential for industrial applications.

         <title>Revisiting the Baddeley Reaction: Access to Functionalized Decalins by Charge&#8208;Promoted Alkane Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new strategy for the C&#8722;H difunctionalization of purely aliphatic alkane substrates. The reaction proceeds with complete regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity and enables access to a wide range of previously inaccessible acyl 9&#8208;decalinols. Additionally, the application of this method translated well to simple monocyclic alkane substrates.







Abstract
C&#8722;H functionalization of purely aliphatic substrates is a challenging endeavor, as the absence of directing groups generally thwarts attempts at regiocontrol. This is particularly true for difunctionalization reactions, where the control of relative stereochemistry poses an additional obstacle. The Baddeley reaction of decalins, despite suffering from strong limitations with regard to yield and generality, stands as one of only few known transformations capable of regio&#8208; and stereocontrol in aliphatic C&#8722;H functionalization. Herein, we report a regio&#8208; and diastereoselective method for the double functionalization of decalins enabling access to a novel, unreported regioisomer in synthetically useful yields. This method was also successfully applied to a range of other alkane substrates, enabling a straightforward synthesis of keto alcohols from the simplest alkane building blocks.

         <title>Anomeric Amide&#8208;Enabled Alkene&#8208;Arene and Alkene&#8208;Alkene Aminative Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;component alkene&#8208;arene and alkene&#8208;alkene aminative coupling reaction has been developed for the synthesis of secondary amines and aziridines. This was achieved through the design, synthesis and implementation of an anomeric amide reagent, capable of promoting catalyst&#8208;free alkene chloroamination transformations, installing a formal nitrene precursor that can subsequently undergo either C&#8722;H insertion or [2+1] cycloaddition.







Abstract
Despite the prominence of C&#8722;N bond forming cross&#8208;coupling reactions as a strategy to assemble molecular fragments, aminative coupling approaches, in which two fragments are assembled directly at the heteroatom, represents a rarely exploited retrosynthetic strategy. Herein, we report the design, synthesis, and implementation of an anomeric amide reagent capable of promoting highly regioselective aminative alkene&#8208;arene and alkene&#8208;alkene coupling reactions. This transformation follows a sequence of catalyst&#8208;free chloroamination, N&#8208;deprotection, and formal nitrene functionalization, all in one&#8208;pot. Due to the simplicity of both the protocol and the building blocks required, high&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE) was employed, in combination with a full&#8208;scale scope, to rapidly and efficiently explore a wide range of chemical space and determine the limits of reactivity. In addition, alternative reactivity modes from the functionalized intermediates delivered by this protocol demonstrate the divergent nature of this aminative coupling strategy.

The structure&#8208;directing phthalocyanine assembles the supramolecular heterodimers into porous cubic crystals similar to those formed without incorporation of the porphyrin. Accessibility to both macrocycles of within the co&#8208;crystals and their reactivity are demonstrated by insitu metal insertion.







Abstract
Porphyrin&#8208;based porous materials are of growing interest as heterogeneous catalysts especially for reactions that are of importance to sustainability. Here we demonstrate that porous molecular crystals can be prepared by the simple co&#8208;crystallisation of tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) with octa(2&#8217;,6&#8217;&#8208;di&#8208;iso&#8208;propylphenoxy)phthalocyanine or some of its metal complexes [(dipPhO)8PcM; M=H2, Al&#8722;OH, Ti=O, Mn&#8722;Cl, Fe&#8722;Cl, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga&#8722;Cl, Ag, In&#8722;Cl or Au&#8722;Cl]. This process is facilitated by the efficient formation of the supramolecular heterodimer between TPP and (dipPhO)8PcM, which is driven by the complementary shape and symmetry of the two macrocycles. The (dipPhO)8PcM component directs the crystal structure of the heterodimers to form Phthalocyanine Nanoporous Crystals (PNCs) of similar structure to those formed by (dipPhO)8PcM alone. The incorporation of TPP appears to partially stabilise the PNCs towards the removal of included solvent and for cocrystals containing (dipPhO)8PcCo stability can be enhanced further by the insitu addition of 4,4&#8208;bipyridyl to act as a &#8220;molecular wall tie&#8221;. These stabilised PNC/TPP cocrystals have a Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller surface area (SABET) of 454&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a micropore volume (Vmp) of 0.22&#8197;mL&#8201;g&#8722;1. The reactivity of both macrocycles within the PNC/TPP co&#8208;crystals is demonstrated by insitu metal insertion.

         <title>Determining the Absolute Configuration of Small Molecules by Diffusion NMR Experiments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Determining the absolute configuration of chiral molecules is a fundamental analytical challenge, particularly in NMR spectroscopy, where enantiomer signals are overlapped. A convenient new approach is proposed, CHIral Micelle Enantiomer Resolving Agent (CHIMERA), which combines chiral micelles and resolving chemical shift agents to provide a rapid solution for resolving enantiomers and determining the absolute configuration via diffusion NMR.







Abstract
Enantiomers are ubiquitous in many areas of science, such as pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and food. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) alone is not able to differentiate enantiomers as their spectra are identical. However, these can be distinguished using chiral auxiliaries (such as chiral complexing agents) that form diastereomeric complexes, but absolute identification is still troublesome, usually requiring a chemical reaction with a chiral derivatizing agent. Here, we propose a new method that uses a hybrid mixture of solvating agents in a simple comparison of diffusion NMR experiments, which can discriminate enantiomers in both frequency and diffusion domains, dubbed CHIMERA (CHIral Micelle Enantiomer Resolving Agent). The new method was assessed for twenty&#8208;three small chiral molecules using a combination of BINOL and (&#8722;)&#8208;DMEB, a chiral surfactant, and initial results indicate that absolute configuration can be obtained from a simple experiment.

         <title>Organic Crystal with Anti&#8208;Stokes Photoluminescent Excitation and Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Features</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two thermal activation processes, anti&#8208;Stokes photoluminescence and delayed fluorescence bolster in crystalized DPQ&#8208;DPAC. The organic crystals demonstrate dual capabilities of hot band absorption with a notable 0.1&#8197;eV anti&#8208;Stokes shift emission and efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence performance. Conformational changes of the crystalized DPQ&#8208;DPAC molecule are identified for such properties.







Abstract
Thermal activation process utilizes environmental thermal energy to help supplement energy for the nonspontaneous energy&#8208;consuming upconversion physical transitions with positive free energy change (&#916;G&gt;0). Reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) and hot band absorption are two kinds of thermal activation transitions. Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials with rISC have significantly propelled advancements in organic semiconductors. Hot band absorption, enables anti&#8208;Stokes photoluminescence, offering a promising route for efficient photon upconversion. In this work, we constructed a crystal consisting of a donor&#8208;acceptor type TADF molecule, DPQ&#8208;DPAC, demonstrating dual thermal activation properties of hot band absorption with a notable 0.1&#8197;eV anti&#8208;Stokes shift emission and proficient TADF performance. Only in the crystal TADF efficiency facilitates and the photoluminescence quantum yield elevates to an impressive 90.8&#8201;%. Combining the extended absorption spectrum, these enhancements collectively realize anti&#8208;Stokes photoluminescence in crystal. Experimental and theoretical results on the DPQ&#8208;DPAC crystal indicate optimizations in its conformational and vibrational modes, resulting in enhancements to its properties. This finding provides insight into crafting organic materials with thermally activated functionalities and contributes to fully exploiting the potential of organic materials, further advancing versatile materials applications.

         <title>Non&#8208;Canonical C16 Homoterpene Biosynthesis Widespread in Actinobacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first biosynthetic pathway to C16 homoterpenes in actinobacteria is reported. A novel methyltransferase family mediates methylation and double bond isomerization to produce a modified C16 precursor. Subsequent conversion by a distinct terpene cyclase family yields unprecedented homoterpenes. The findings enable the development of novel biocatalytic strategies to explore and exploit the biological and pharmaceutical effect of terpene methylations.







Abstract
A novel biosynthetic pathway towards the rare and underexplored non&#8208;canonical family of homoterpenes was discovered in actinobacteria through targeted genome mining and enzymatic in vitro reconstitution. The pathway comprises initial methylation&#8208;induced double bond isomerization of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) to (2E,7E)&#8208;6&#8208;methyl&#8208;farnesyl diphosphate, catalyzed by a novel family of methyltransferases with unique dual function. The resulting linear C16 double bond isomer of FPP constitutes the specific substrate for a distinct family of type&#8197;I terpene cyclases, catalyzing diverse cyclization reactions. Functional characterization of nine enzyme pairs led to discovery of five unprecedented homoterpene natural products. The enzymological novelty enables the development of novel biocatalytic and genetically programmable synthetic strategies towards methylated terpenoids with potentially unique properties (&#8220;magic methyl effect&#8221;).

         <title>Microfluidic Precision Manufacture of High Performance Liquid Chromatographic Microspheres</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microfluidic precision manufacture for high performance chromatographic microspheres was developed, with an unprecedented 100&#8201;% production yield, independent controllability of morphology, pore structure and material chemistry. The microspheres&#8217; continuous adjustability of pore size enables resolution fine&#8208;tuning for protein chromatography. Microfluidic precision manufacture paves the way towards green and precision chromatographic industry.







Abstract
A key bottleneck in developing chromatographic material is the chemically entangled control of morphology, pore structure, and material chemistry, which holds back precision material manufacture in order to pursue advanced separation performance. In this work, a precision manufacture strategy based on droplet microfluidics was developed, for production of highly efficient chromatographic microspheres with independent control over particle morphology, pore structure and material chemistry. The droplet&#8208;synthesized microspheres display extremely narrow particle size distribution (CV&lt;3&#8201;%), enabling a 100&#8201;% production yield due to complete elimination of sieving steps. More importantly, the size of the droplet&#8208;synthesized microspheres is freely adjustable without the need for re&#8208;optimizing chemical recipes or reaction conditions. The resulting materials exhibit excellent separation efficiencies, achieving a reduced plate height of hmin=1.67. This precision manufacture strategy also allows for flexible pore design and continuous pore size adjustment across three orders of magnitudes, providing a novel vehicle for resolution fine&#8208;tuning targeting protein separation. Besides traditional silica, organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid silica, zirconia, and titania microspheres can also be precisely synthesized on the same platform, supporting various separation applications and operating conditions. Powered by precision manufacture, super&#8208;throughput production, and versatile chemistry, the high&#8208;performance droplet&#8208;synthesized separation material will pave the way towards green and precision chromatographic industry.

In this work, a precision manufacture strategy based on droplet microfluidics was developed, for production of highly efficient chromatographic microspheres with independent control over particle morphology, pore structure and material chemistry. The droplet-synthesized microspheres display extremely narrow particle size distribution (CV&amp;lt;3&#8201;%), enabling a 100&#8201;% production yield due to complete elimination of sieving steps. More importantly, the size of the droplet-synthesized microspheres is freely adjustable without the need for re-optimizing chemical recipes or reaction conditions. The resulting materials exhibit excellent separation efficiencies, achieving a reduced plate height of &lt;i&gt;h&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;=1.67. This precision manufacture strategy also allows for flexible pore design and continuous pore size adjustment across three orders of magnitudes, providing a novel vehicle for resolution fine-tuning targeting protein separation. Besides traditional silica, organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid silica, zirconia, and titania microspheres can also be precisely synthesized on the same platform, supporting various separation applications and operating conditions. Powered by precision manufacture, super-throughput production, and versatile chemistry, the high-performance droplet-synthesized separation material will pave the way towards green and precision chromatographic industry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Chemically Powered Rotary Molecular Motor Based on Reversible Oxazepine Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we report an aniline&#8208;phenol&#8208;based rotary molecular motor that operates via an information ratchet mechanism. The 360&#176; directional rotation about a single covalent bond can be chemically driven by reversible oxazepine formation. Both the oxazepine formation and hydrolysis steps are kinetically gated via dynamic kinetic resolution, arising from the kinetic bias of chiral catalysts for enantiomers.







Abstract
While biological machines are powered mainly by chemical transformations, chemically driven artificial rotary motor systems are very limited. Here, we report an aniline&#8208;phenol&#8208;based rotary molecular motor that operates via an information ratchet mechanism. The 360&#176; directional rotation about a single covalent bond can be chemically driven by reversible oxazepine formation. Both the oxazepine formation and hydrolysis steps are kinetically gated via dynamic kinetic resolution, arising from the kinetic bias of chiral catalysts for enantiomers. Given the 95&#8201;% ee (97.5&#8201;:&#8201;2.5) and 88&#8201;% ee (94&#8201;:&#8201;6) of the individual gating steps of motor analogues, the overall directionality ratio could be calculated to be 91.7&#8201;:&#8201;8.3 (97.5&#8201;%&#215;94&#8201;%&#8776;91.7&#8201;%), which means that the motor will make one mistake (backward rotation) approximately every 11 to 12 turns.

         <dc:description>
The generic incorporation of a thioxanthone&#8208;containing amino acid into a protein scaffold is described. The resulting artificial photoenzyme was engineered to catalyze a dearomative [2+2] cycloaddition reaction in high yields with excellent enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Genetically encodable photosensitizers allow the design of artificial photoenzymes to expand the scope of abiological reactions. Herein, we report the genetic incorporation of a thioxanthone&#8208;containing amino acid into a protein scaffold via an engineered pyrrolysyl&#8208;tRNA/pyrrolysyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase pair. The designer enzyme was engineered to catalyze a dearomative [2+2] cycloaddition reaction in high yields (up to&gt;99&#8201;% yield) with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2 e.r.). This work provides a robust and facile method for photoenzyme design and lays the foundation for the development of further photoenzymatic reactions.

         <title>Ultrahigh Proton Selectivity by Assembled Cationic Covalent Organic Framework Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bottom&#8208;up strategy with an oil&#8208;oil&#8208;water triphase for ionic covalent organic framework nanosheet fabrication is developed. The intermediate oil layer modulates the reaction rate to form a crystalline COF nanosheet with a high&#8208;aspect ratio. The resulting membrane exhibits outstanding proton selectivity over other cations.







Abstract
Ionic covalent organic framework (COF) nanosheets are becoming increasingly attractive as promising two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials for proton transport due to their ionic functionality and tailor&#8208;made pores. However, most synthetic methods for nanosheets rely on surface&#8208;assisted methods or phase transformation often yielding nanosheets with low aspect ratios. In this study, we present a bottom&#8208;up approach utilizing an oil&#8208;oil&#8208;water triphase system to achieve the large&#8208;scale synthesis of ionic COF nanosheets. The intermediate oil layer in this system modulates the diffusion rate of monomers from the top oil phase into the aqueous phase, enabling in&#8208;plane anisotropic secondary growth from the initial discrete fibrous structure into large and crystalline COF nanosheets. The ionic COF nanosheets exhibit excellent proton permeability while simultaneously excluding other cations by casting into crack&#8208;free membranes, demonstrating efficient HCl extraction from acidic water waste. This strategy for larger&#8208;scale COF nanosheet growth will offer an alternative platform for designing multifunctional COF membranes with applications in sophisticated separation technologies.

         <title>Electrochemical Dicarboxylation of Vinyl Epoxide with CO2 for the Facile and Selective Synthesis of Diacids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an electrochemical dicarboxylation of vinyl epoxides using CO2, featuring a CO2 radical anion addition induced sequential cleavage of two C&#8211;O bonds. This method displays high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity and is applicable to &#945;&#8208;aryl, &#945;&#8208;alkyl, &#945;&#8208;styryl epoxides, and cyclic carbonates. The versatility of the resulting multifunctional diacids is highlighted by their diverse functionalizations.







Abstract
We present a novel electrochemical dicarboxylation of epoxides with CO2, characterized by the cleavage of two C&#8722;O single bonds. Not only are vinyl epoxides viable, but cyclic carbonates also serve as effective substrates, facilitating the synthesis of E&#8208;configured adipic and octanedioic acids with high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity. The synthetic practicality is further highlighted by the diverse functionalizations of the resulting multifunctional diacids. Mechanistic studies support the single&#8208;electron transfer reduction of CO2 to its radical anion, which undergoes radical addition to the vinyl moiety of epoxides. The subsequent reductive cleavage of two C&#8722;O bonds, coupled with a nucleophilic attack on CO2, culminates in the formation of the desired diacid products.

Mechanistic studies support the single-electron transfer reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to its radical anion, which undergoes radical addition to the vinyl moiety of epoxides. The subsequent reductive cleavage of two C&#8722;O bonds, coupled with a nucleophilic attack on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, culminates in the formation of the desired diacid products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Applicable Descriptors under Weak Metal&#8208;Oxygen d&#8211;p Interaction for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
New descriptors are presented for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in ionic systems. Through first&#8208;principles calculations, the limitations of the most widely used and crucial descriptors d&#8208;band center and charge transfer energy, are demonstrated. Novel descriptors, &#955;1 and &#955;2, are proposed for more accurate OER performance predictions. Their application to multi&#8208;component and high&#8208;entropy oxides offers insights into designing more efficient catalytic materials.







Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a crucial role in water electrolysis and renewable energy conversion processes. Descriptors are utilized to elucidate the structure&#8208;performance relationships of OER catalytic materials, yet each descriptor exhibits specificity to particular systems. Currently, there is a lack of effective descriptors to describe the relationship between electronic structure and OER performance in ionic systems. This study reveals for the first time that widely used OER descriptors, the d&#8208;band center and charge transfer energy, are limited in their effectiveness for oxide systems dominated by ionic bonds, in which ionic interactions significantly enhance or suppress the catalytic activity. Furthermore, composite descriptors tailored for ionic systems are proposed, with findings extended to complex multi&#8208;component and high&#8208;entropy oxides. The results indicate that the metal d&#8208;band unoccupied states parameter and the active states parameter can serve as effective OER descriptors for ionic catalytic materials. This work addresses the gap in OER descriptors for ionic systems, offering a new theoretical foundation and guidance for the development of efficient OER catalytic materials.

         <title>B12&#8208;Dependent Radical SAM Enzymes Catalyze C&#8208;Fluoromethylation via a CH2F&#8208;Cobalamin Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
B12&#8208;dependent radical SAM methyltransferases were found to fluoromethylate unactivated carbon centers of peptide and natural products. This process was initiated by the 5'&#8208;dA radical produced from F&#8208;SAM and involved the important intermediate CH2F&#8208;cobalamin.







Abstract
Fluorine and fluorine&#8208;containing functional groups play important roles in drugs and agrochemicals. Recently, SAM&#8208;dependent methyltransferases and several SAM analogues have been reported for fluoromethyl transfer through a nucleophilic mechanism. However, fluoromethylation of unactivated carbon centers is very challenging, and their substitution usually involves a radical mechanism. To date, no biocatalysts have been developed for fluoromethylation of unactivated carbon centers. In this study, we found that the B12&#8208;dependent radical SAM methyltransferase (B12&#8208;RSMT) QCMT can fluoromethylate the glutamine C&#945; position of peptides with fluorinated SAM (F&#8208;SAM) generated in situ by the enzyme AclHMT. QCMT can cleave F&#8208;SAM to produce the 5'&#8208;dA radical. The significant reaction intermediate CH2FCbI was characterized by HR&#8208;MS, 19F&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography. In addition, B12&#8208;RSMTs CysS and GenD1 can also transfer fluoromethyl groups onto natural products. We also found that F&#8208;SAM is not compulsory. The reduced B12&#8208;RSMTs can directly generate CH2FCbI with CH2FI and transfer the CH2F group when SAM is used as the radical initiator. Our results demonstrate a radical&#8208;mediated enzymatic strategy for fluoromethylation with abiological cofactors and expand radical SAM enzymes to the field of fluorine chemistry.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Bonds&#8208;Mediated Color&#8208;Switchable Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Helical Assemblies of Achiral Liquid Crystal Block Copolymer Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exogenous axial chiral molecules induce helical assembly of liquid crystal block copolymers, achieving chiral transfer and amplification via non&#8208;covalent interaction and liquid crystal self&#8208;assembly. Dynamic covalent bonds of cyanostilbene groups are precisely tunable under UV light, enabling the fixation and unlocking of chiral information and color switching. This facile strategy provides guidance for visualizing chiral storage and encoding.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) film attracted considerable attention in information storage and encryption, three&#8208;dimensional display, and chiral recognition. However, due to the limited molecular mobility within thin film, achieving a high asymmetry factor and non&#8208;contact modulation of CPL remain challenging. In this work, color&#8208;switchable homochiral CPL films with high luminescence asymmetry factor (glum~0.11) were constructed based on the co&#8208;assembly of a liquid crystal block copolymer (poly (ethylene oxide)&#8208;b&#8208;poly (methyl methacrylate) bearing cyanostilbene group) with axial chiral dinaphthalene diamine derivatives (R/S&#8208;DINBPA). Mechanistic investigation revealed that the efficient stacking of R/S&#8208;DINBPA with cyanostilbene groups and the liquid crystal field provide the driving force for chiral transfer and amplification. The dynamic covalent bonds of the cyanostilbene groups endow the film with chiral fixation ability and enable precise modulation of CPL luminescence bands under UV light irradiation, making it suitable for chiral patterned anti&#8208;counterfeit encryption. This facile strategy provides a general platform for designing intelligent chiroptical materials.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Diazoester Installation via Arylthianthrenium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arylthianthrenium salts were converted into aryl diazoesters via palladium catalysis. This strategy enables the efficient and site&#8208;selective late&#8208;stage functionalization of advanced substrates with an &#945;&#8208;diazoester functionality. The thus introduced diazo moiety can subsequently undergo various C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions.







Abstract
By leveraging the fast oxidative addition of arylthianthrenium salts (aryl&#8208;TT+) to palladium(0), a regioselective diazoester installation has been developed. This approach enables the introduction of a diazo moiety to densely functionalized arenes at a late stage. The installed diazo group is amenable to facile further derivatization.

         <title>Probing the Hidden Photoisomerization of a Symmetric Phosphaalkene Switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the synthesis and analysis of a novel, air&#8208;stable, solvent&#8208;resistant phosphaalkene switch exhibiting degenerate photoisomerization. The research elucidates the isomerization mechanism using PC&#8208;EXSY NMR spectroscopy, ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, and MRSF&#8208;TDDFT calculations. The work deepens our understanding of symmetric heteroalkene systems, opening new avenues for main group&#8208;based molecular machines.







Abstract
In this study, we present the synthesis and analysis of a novel, air&#8208;stable, and solvent&#8208;resistant phosphaalkene switch. Using this symmetric switch, we have demonstrated degenerate photoisomerization experimentally for the first time. With a combination of photochemical&#8208;exchange NMR spectroscopy, ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, and quantum chemical calculations, we elucidate the isomerization mechanism of this symmetric phosphaalkene, comparing it to two other known molecules belonging to this class. Our findings highlight the critical role of the isolobal analogy between C=P and C=C bonds in governing nanoscale molecular motion and break new ground for our understanding of light&#8208;induced molecular processes in symmetric heteroalkene systems.

&lt;p&gt;This study presents the synthesis and analysis of a novel, air-stable, solvent-resistant phosphaalkene switch exhibiting degenerate photoisomerization. The research elucidates the isomerization mechanism using PC-EXSY NMR spectroscopy, ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, and MRSF-TDDFT calculations. The work deepens our understanding of symmetric heteroalkene systems, opening new avenues for main group-based molecular machines.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we present the synthesis and analysis of a novel, air-stable, and solvent-resistant phosphaalkene switch. Using this symmetric switch, we have demonstrated degenerate photoisomerization &lt;i&gt;experimentally&lt;/i&gt; for the first time. With a combination of photochemical-exchange NMR spectroscopy, ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, and quantum chemical calculations, we elucidate the isomerization mechanism of this symmetric phosphaalkene, comparing it to two other known molecules belonging to this class. Our findings highlight the critical role of the isolobal analogy between C=P and C=C bonds in governing nanoscale molecular motion and break new ground for our understanding of light-induced molecular processes in symmetric heteroalkene systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polarity&#8208;Reversed Functionalization of Aliphatic Aldehydes via Divergent Nickel Hydride Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;hydride catalyzed, polarity&#8208;reversed approach for divergent activation and functionalization of aliphatic aldehydes is reported. This mild and operationally simple process enables the transformation of a wide variety of readily available aliphatic aldehydes, along with alkyl or aryl electrophiles, into the corresponding secondary alcohols or more challenging deoxygenated alkanes with excellent chemoselectivity.







Abstract
Divergent catalysis represents an exciting frontier for unlocking molecular structural diversity and exploring new activation modes. Here, we report the unexpected discovery of polarity&#8208;reversed divergent activation and functionalization of aliphatic aldehydes, where enolizable aliphatic aldehydes are selectively activated by nickel hydride to form two distinct alkylnickel intermediates divergently. This mild and operationally simple process enables the transformation of a wide variety of readily available aliphatic aldehydes, along with alkyl or aryl electrophiles, into the corresponding secondary alcohols or more challenging deoxygenated alkanes with excellent chemoselectivity.

         <title>Synthesis and Functionalization of Sulfoximine&#8208;Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes: Functionalizable, Tuneable and Cysteine&#8208;Selective Chiral Warheads</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfoximine substituted bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes are prepared in one&#8208;pot and then diversified through 3 vectors. N&#8208;Functionalization allows controlled variation in the electrophilicity of the BCB in strain release processes including in protein labelling under biocompatible conditions, and the proximal stereocenter allows stereoselective protein labelling.







Abstract
Electrophilic covalent warheads with appropriate reactivity and selectivity are crucial to the investigation of protein function and the discovery of therapeutics. Here we report the synthesis of sulfoximine bicyclo[1.1.0] butanes (BCBs) as novel thiol reactive chiral warheads, achieved in one&#8208;pot from methylsulfoximines. Unusually the warhead can then be derivatized, keeping the BCB intact, over 3 vectors: i) sulfoximine N&#8208;modification instills a broad range of strain&#8208;release reactivity; ii) sp2&#8208;cross&#8208;coupling reactions on aryl&#8208;BCB&#8208;sulfoximines allows direct diversification, and iii) functionalization of the BCB motif itself is achieved by metalation and trapping with electrophiles. The BCB sulfoximines are shown to react selectively with cysteine including in a protein model (CDK2) under biocompatible conditions. Preliminary data indicate suitability for chemoproteomic applications, and enantioselective cysteine&#8208;labelling. The reactivity of sulfoximine BCBs with electron withdrawing groups on nitrogen is comparable to acrylamides with low to moderate reactivity.

         <title>Biofuel&#8208;Driven Stepping Chiral Supramolecular Transfer Container</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biofuel&#8208;mediated adaptive chiral luminescent supramolecular transfer container exhibited reversible thermal responsiveness and stepping&#8208;regulated chirality transfer by the catalysis of enzymes in tandem, as well as recovered chirality after refueled, achieving programmable regulation of multistate supramolecular chiroptical performance, which was successfully applied in logic gates and information encryption.







Abstract
Herein, we reported a biofuel&#8208;driven recyclable chiral supramolecular transfer container based on hexacationic triphenylamine cage and nucleotides. Possessing rotatable paddle rigid backbones, the artificial receptor effectively encapsulated nucleotides with a high binding constant up to 5.37&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1 in water, displaying guest&#8208;induced efficient fluorescence enhancement with quantum yield increased from 6.5&#8201;% to 16.6&#8201;%. Especially, the achiral cage could effectively bind with adenosine triphosphate to activate chirality transfer from substrates to the single molecular container, giving circularly polarized luminescence at 575&#8197;nm and positive Cotton effect peaks with significant asymmetric factor (gabs=+6.4&#215;10&#8722;4). Meanwhile, the adaptive chiral supramolecule not only has reversible thermal responsiveness but also could stepwise regulate chirality transfer by the catalysis of hexokinase and apyrase in tandem, showing recovery adaptive chirality after refueled, achieving dynamically regulated programmable multistate chiral luminescent supramolecules. Therefore, the biofuel&#8208;driven chiral supramolecular transfer container could be successfully applied in chiral logic gates and multilevel information encryption, providing new insight into intelligent chiral materials.

         <title>Manipulating Dynamic Light&#8208;Driven Solid&#8208;Liquid Transition and Static Reversible Photochromism via Organic Cocrystal Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing of molecular crystalline materials with light&#8208;induced multiple dynamic deformation in space dimension and photochromism on time scales has attracted much attention for its potential applications in actuators, sensoring and information storage. Nevertheless, organic crystals capable of both photoinduced dynamic effects and static color change are rare, particularly for multi&#8208;component cocrystals system. In this study, we first report the construction of charge transfer co&#8208;crystals allows their light&#8208;induced solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transition and photochromic behaviors to be controlled by trans&#8208;stilbene (TSB) as an electron donor and 3,4,5,6&#8208;Tetrafluorophthalonitrile (TFP) as an electron acceptor. In this case, the dynamic photo&#8208;responsive solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid phase transition is due to the photoisomerization of TSB under UV irradiation, while the accumulation of melted droplets during solid&#8208;state photochemical process causes mechanical deformation of TSB&#8208;TFP cocrystals. The subsequent reversible photochromic behavior is attributed to the emergence of free radicals through a photo&#8208;induced electron transfer. Moreover, TSB&#8208;TFP microcrystals present typical excitation wavelength dependent emission (EWDE) fluorescence by surfactant&#8208;mediated method. This work realizes the dynamic&#8208;static photochemical cascade processes in response to light irradiation in an organic cocrystal system, providing the effective method for a new type of smart photo&#8208;responsive materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Resonance 1,4&#8208;BN&#8208;Heteroarene for Filterless Narrowband Photodetector</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As an emerging class of optoelectronic materials, multi&#8208;resonance (MR) 1,4&#8208;BN&#8208;heteroarenes have been extensively employed as narrowband electroluminescence materials, whereas their absorption feature has largely been neglected. Here we construct the first MR&#8208;molecule&#8208;based phototransistor for filterless narrowband photodetectors (NBPDs) by anchoring narrowband absorption MR molecules on the high&#8208;mobility semiconductor indium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide (IZO) film. The resulting device exhibits high&#8208;performance photodetection with a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 33 nm, which represents a new record for NBPDs based on intrinsic narrowband absorbing materials. These results demonstrate the great potential of MR materials as a new molecular platform for developing high&#8208;performance NBPDs.</dc:description>

         <title>The First Kleinman&#8208;type Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation Circular Dichroism On/Off Switchable Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral ferroelectrics have recently received considerable interest due to their unique chiroptical properties. They can adopt Kleinman symmetry second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG)&#8208;active chiral&#8208;polar point groups in the ferroelectric phase while Kleinman symmetry SHG&#8208;inactive chiral&#8208;nonpolar point groups in the paraelectric phase, providing a great opportunity to realize on/off switching of SHG circular dichroism (SHG&#8208;CD) response. However, the SHG&#8208;CD effect was rarely explored in chiral ferroelectrics, and the on/off switchable SHG&#8208;CD has never been reported. Herein, we report the first crown ether&#8208;based chiral ferroelectrics (R/S&#8208;CS)Ca(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6) (CS = camphor&#8208;10&#8208;sulfonic acid), which undergo a 422F2 type ferroelectric phase transition at around 336 K from Kleinman symmetry SHG&#8208;active point group 2 to Kleinman symmetry SHG&#8208;inactive point group 422. Notably, they exhibit obvious SHG&#8208;CD responses with an anisotropy factor of up to 0.31. More importantly, the SHG&#8208;CD response can be switched between SHG&#8208;CD active (SHG&#8208;CD on) and inactive (SHG&#8208;CD off) states during the ferroelectric phase transition, which is unprecedented. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of Kleinman&#8208;type SHG&#8208;CD on/off switchable ferroelectric. Our findings open up a new way to switch SHG&#8208;CD response based on chiral ferroelectrics, which would greatly inspire the further exploration of switchable SHG&#8208;CD effects in chiral ferroelectrics.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Functionalization Harnessing Radical&#8208;Mediated Functional&#8208;Group Migration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Along with the renaissance of radical chemistry, the past decade has witnessed rapid development in radical&#8208;mediated rearrangement reactions. A wide diversity of radical approaches harnessing functional&#8208;group migration (FGM) have been devised to enhance both synthetic efficiency and molecular complexity. However, the application of FGM reactions to construct stereogenic centers remains underexplored owing to the inherent challenges of asymmetric radical reactions. In this Minireview, we summarize the emerging area of asymmetric functionalization involving radical&#8208;mediated FGM reactions. Enantioselectivity can be regulated by chiral substrates, auxiliaries or reagents, or achieved through asymmetric transition&#8208;metal catalysis. This synthetic strategy demonstrates its superiority in the production of valuable complex molecules that are otherwise difficult to obtain by conventional methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Helical Quintulene: Synthesis, Chirality, and Supramolecular Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quintulene is a quintuply symmetrical cycloarene with a positively curved molecular geometry. First described by Staab and Sauer in 1984, its successful synthesis was not achieved until 2020. Due to the challenges posed by its positive curvature, structural extensions of quintulene have been studied rarely. In this work, we report the synthesis of a chiral quintulene (1) featuring five [5]helicene units at its rim constructed through the introduction of steric hindrance. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis confirmed the structure of 1 that showcases a unique chirality combining helicity and rotational symmetry. The enantiomers of 1 were separated and their chiroptical properties were examined, revealing the dissymmetric absorption and luminescence. Additionally, the bowl shape facilitates supramolecular assembly between 1 and fullerenes, with a binding constant to C60 10&#8208;fold higher than to C70. This work expands the structural diversity of quintulene and bridges the structures of cycloarenes and multi&#8208;helicenes, paving the way for the structural design of chiral cycloarenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Isomerism of {Ag14}10+ Nanocluster Encapsulated by Bowl&#8208;like Polyoxometalates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structural isomerism of atomically precise nanoclusters provides a preeminent theoretical model to investigate the structure&#8722;property relationships. Herein, we synthesized three bowl&#8208;like polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;encapsulated Ag nanoclusters (denoted as {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;1, {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;1a, and {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;2) via a facile one&#8208;pot solvothermal approach. Among them, for the first time, an unprecedented isomeric {Ag14}10+ nanoclusters are obtained in polyoxoanions {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;1 and {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;2, which should be probably induced by the different distribution of coordinating O atoms in two isomeric bowl&#8208;like {Sb3W30} ligands. Clusters {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;1 and {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;2 exhibit distinct electronic structures and physicochemical properties due to the different geometric structures of the {Ag14}10+ nanoclusters, but both clusters can effectively catalyze the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution with over 22,000 turnovers (TONs) after 6&#8208;hour photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Force&#8208;Trainable Liquid Crystal Elastomer Enabled by Mechanophore&#8208;Induced Radical Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In nature, organisms adapt to environmental changes through training to learn new abilities, offering valuable insights for developing intelligent materials. However, replicating this adaptive learning in synthetic materials presents a significant challenge. This study introduces a feasible approach to train liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) by integrating a mechanophore tetraarylsuccinonitrile (TASN) into their main chain, addressing the challenge of enabling synthetic materials to exchange substances with their environment. Inspired by biological training, the LCEs can self&#8208;strengthen and acquire new functionalities through mechanical stress&#8208;induced radical polymerization. The research not only enhances the mechanical performance of LCEs, but also endows them with the ability to learn properties such as flexibility, light responsiveness, and fluorescence. These advancements are crucial for overcoming the limitations of current materials, paving the way for the creation of advanced intelligent soft materials with autonomous self&#8208;improvement, akin to the adaptive skills of living organisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Where Does the Proton Go? Structure and Dynamics of Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Switching in Aminophosphine Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aminophosphates are the focus of research on prebiotic phosphorylation chemistry. Their bifunctional nature also makes them a powerful class of organocatalysts. However, the structural chemistry and dynamics of proton&#8208;binding in phosphorylation and organocatalytic mechanisms are still not fully understood. Aminophosphine chalcogenides, preserving the H2N&#8211;P+&#8211;Ch&#8722; structural motif, represent well&#8208;suited molecular models that mimic proton&#8208;binding, hydrogen&#8208;bond switching and supramolecular self&#8208;assembling behavior of catalytically and prebiotically relevant molecules. Through spectroscopic (IR, 1H DOSY, 15N NMR), molecular dynamics, and computational investigations, the dynamic proton switching capability of aminophosphate analogs was demonstrated. It was shown under which conditions the amino (NH2) or chalcogen (Ch) functions in H2N&#8211;P+&#8211;Ch&#8722; structural units are protonated.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aminophosphates are the focus of research on prebiotic phosphorylation chemistry. Their bifunctional nature also makes them a powerful class of organocatalysts. However, the structural chemistry and dynamics of proton-binding in phosphorylation and organocatalytic mechanisms are still not fully understood. Aminophosphine chalcogenides, preserving the H2N&#8211;P+&#8211;Ch&#8722; structural motif, represent well-suited molecular models that mimic proton-binding, hydrogen-bond switching and supramolecular self-assembling behavior of catalytically and prebiotically relevant molecules. Through spectroscopic (IR, 1H DOSY, 15N NMR), molecular dynamics, and computational investigations, the dynamic proton switching capability of aminophosphate analogs was demonstrated. It was shown under which conditions the amino (NH2) or chalcogen (Ch) functions in H2N&#8211;P+&#8211;Ch&#8722; structural units are protonated. In fact, all conceivable modes of hydrogen-bonding were identified, revealing substantial differences between the oxygen derivative and the heavier congeners. Using coordinating anions, supramolecular zigzag- and cube-shaped arrangements were found in the solid-state and in solution.

In the absence of coordinating anions, protonation of the chalcogen function is preferred. In contrast to the oxygen derivative, the heavier congeners show dynamic intramolecular proton-hopping between the chalcogen and the amino function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Clone&#8208;Resolved Chemical Depletion of T cells via Cellular Proximity Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>T cells play a pivotal role in the development of autoimmune diseases. To mitigate autoimmune inflammation without inducing global immunosuppression, it is crucial to selectively eliminate autoreactive T cell clones while preserving the normal T cell repertoire. In this study, we applied cellular proximity chemistry to develop a T&#8208;cell depletion method with clonal precision. Using engineered dendritic cells (DCs) with surface&#8208;bound photosensitizers, we generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) at immune synapses, leading to the targeted death of antigen&#8208;specific T cells in close proximity. This process induces lipid oxidation in T cell membranes, triggering ferroptosis&#8208;like cell death. The method enables the selective elimination of specific T cell clones without affecting others, in which the clonal resolution was demonstrated by TCR sequencing. Finally, we demonstrated the efficacy of this approach in a type 1 diabetes model by selectively depleting the pathogenic 8.3 T cell clone, thereby protecting islet &#946; cells and preserving overall T cell function. This strategy offers a promising avenue for immunosuppressive therapy that targets pathogenic T cells while maintaining overall immune integrity.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring molecular diffusion in core&#8208;shell zeolite imidazolate framework composites realizes efficient kinetic separation of xylene isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The separation of xylene isomers is a critical and energy&#8208;intensive process in the petrochemical industry, primarily due to their closely similar molecular structures and boiling points. In this work, we report the synthesis and application of a novel core&#8208;shell zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) composite, ZIF&#8208;65@ZIF&#8208;67, designed to significantly enhance the kinetic separation of xylene isomers through a synergistic "shell&#8208;gated diffusion and core&#8208;facilitated transport" strategy. The external ZIF&#8208;67 shell selectively restricts the diffusion of larger isomers (MX and OX), while the internal ZIF&#8208;65 core accelerates the diffusion of PX, thereby amplifying the diffusion differences among the isomers. This architecture yields remarkable improvements in both selectivity and diffusion rates, as demonstrated by vapor&#8208;phase adsorption studies and molecular dynamics simulations. The ZIF&#8208;65@ZIF&#8208;67 composite exhibits up to 12.5 times higher PX/OX selectivity in liquid&#8208;phase adsorption and 3.4 times higher dynamic selectivity in fixed&#8208;column breakthrough experiments compared to the individual ZIF components. Theoretical simulations further corroborate the heterogeneous diffusion control mechanism, revealing the time&#8208;dependent diffusion regulation within the core&#8208;shell architecture. This work underscores the great potential of core&#8208;shell MOF composites in optimizing molecular sieving processes for industrially significant separations and highlights a new route for enhancing kinetic separation efficiency in complex multicomponent systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochromic Color Tuning of Copper&#8208;doped Zinc Sulfide Nanocrystals by Control of Local Dopant Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inorganic photochromic materials offer several advantages over organic compounds, including relatively inexpensive and higher thermal stability. However, tuning their color with the same component has remained a significant challenge. In this study, we demonstrate that the photochromic color of Cu&#8208;doped ZnS nanocrystals (NCs), which is initially pale yellow before light irradiation, can be tuned from gray to brown by adjusting the surface stoichiometry of Zn and S, which is controlled through the use of thiol and non&#8208;thiol ligands. Several experiments and quantum chemical calculations using model clusters revealed that the color change is determined by the distribution of Cu, which significantly contributes to the coloration, specifically whether it resides on the Zn&#8208;rich or S&#8208;rich surface. In contrast, particle size and Cu concentration were found to have little effect on the photochromic color. This study expands the diversity of photochromic responses in inorganic NCs and marks an important step toward the development of further advanced photochromic nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design Two&#8208; or Four&#8208;Electron Reaction Pathway Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient and Selective Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are often employed in oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) for hydrogen peroxide production due to their tunable structures and compositions. However, COF electrocatalysts require precise structural engineering, such as heteroatoms or metal site doping, to modulate the reaction pathway during the ORR process. In this work, we designed a tetraphenyl&#8208;p&#8208;phenylenediamine based COF electrocatalyst, namely TPDA&#8208;BDA, which exhibited excellent two&#8208;electron (2e) ORR performance with high H2O2 selectivity of 89.7% and faraday efficiency (FE) of 86.7%, higher than the reported COFs to date for H2O2 electrosynthesis. The theoretical and experimental results showed that the rate&#8208;determining step energy barrier for reduction of O2 to OOH* intermediates was significantly reduced by replacing of bipyridine with biphenyl blocks, changing from 4e to 2e ORR reaction pathway. Also, the donor&#8208;acceptor characteristic and narrower optical band gap of TPDA&#8208;BDA COF enhanced the electronic conductivity and reduction ability, thus elevating the catalytic activity. As a result, the H2O2 selectivity was maintained above 85% even after 50 h stability test.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are often employed in oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) for hydrogen peroxide production due to their tunable structures and compositions. However, COF electrocatalysts require precise structural engineering, such as heteroatoms or metal site doping, to modulate the reaction pathway during the ORR process. In this work, we designed a tetraphenyl-p-phenylenediamine based COF electrocatalyst, namely TPDA-BDA, which exhibited excellent two-electron (2e) ORR performance with high H2O2 selectivity of 89.7% and faraday efficiency (FE) of 86.7%, higher than the reported COFs to date for H2O2 electrosynthesis. The theoretical and experimental results showed that the rate-determining step energy barrier for reduction of O2 to OOH* intermediates was significantly reduced by replacing of bipyridine with biphenyl blocks, changing from 4e to 2e ORR reaction pathway. Also, the donor-acceptor characteristic and narrower optical band gap of TPDA-BDA COF enhanced the electronic conductivity and reduction ability, thus elevating the catalytic activity. As a result, the H2O2 selectivity was maintained above 85% even after 50 h stability test. This work reveals the structure-property relationship of COF electrocatalysts and provides a new strategy for rational design of high performance 2e ORR COF electrocatalysts for efficient and selective hydrogen peroxide production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Accelerated Destruction of Passive Film and Microbial Corrosion of 316L Stainless Steel via Extracellular Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dense passive film on 316L stainless steel is the key in its corrosion resistance. Its interactions with an electroactive biofilm are critical in deciphering microbial corrosion. Herein, an in&#8208;depth investigation using genetic manipulations and addition of an exogenous electron mediator found that extracellular electron transfer (EET) mediated by the electroactive S. oneidensis biofilm grown aerobically accelerated the destruction of the microstructure and weakened the passive film. The changes in surface properties accelerated the electrochemical reactions and increased pitting corrosion. The redox state on the surface also changed due to the activity of the electroactive biofilm. A synergistic EET corrosion mechanism, including both direct and mediated electron transfer with passive film destruction was proposed to illustrate the corrosion caused by electroactive S. oneidensis. The techniques used in this work provide a systematic approach to probe EET impact on microbial corrosion by electroactive biofilms with electron transfer across the biotic&#8208;abiotic interfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Axially Chiral TADF Imidazolium Salts for Circularly Polarized Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A pair of axially chiral thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) enantiomers, R&#8208;TCBN&#8208;ImEtPF6 and S&#8208;TCBN&#8208;ImEtPF6, with intrinsic ionic characteristics were efficiently synthesized by introducing imidazolium hexafluorophosphate to chiral TADF unit. The TADF imidazolium salts exhibited a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of up to 92%, a small singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap (&#8710;EST) of 0.04 eV, as well as reversible redox properties. Furthermore, the enantiomers showed distinct mirror&#8208;image CD and CPL activities with glum values of &#8208;3.7&#215;10&#8208;3 and +3.4&#215;10&#8208;3. Notably, by doping the axial TADF imidazolium salts into achiral TADF sensitizer, sandwich&#8208;structured light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) without the addition of ionic liquids (ILs) or ionic transition&#8208;metal compounds (iTMCs) were fabricated. When driven at 50 A m&#8208;2, the LECs displayed an EQE of up to 5.2% and strong circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) with gEL values of +3.3&#215;10&#8208;3 and &#8208;3.0&#215;10&#8208;3.

         <title>Rigidly Locked Pyrene Excimers in Planar Chiral Pyrenophanes for Intense and Stable Circularly Polarized Photoluminescence and Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aiming at the construction of novel platforms with excellent performances in both circularly polarized photoluminescence (CP&#8208;PL) and electrochemiluminescence (CP&#8208;ECL), a new family of pyrenophanes with rigidly locked pyrene dimers and varied bridges has been designed and synthesized. Attributed to densely packed pyrene excimers, the resultant pyrenophanes revealed tunable bridge&#8208;dependent emission behaviors, as investigated by femtosecond time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy. More importantly, all these planar chiral pyrenophanes display strong CP&#8208;PL with large dissymmetry factor (gPL) values up to 0.034, and such excellent performances remain stable in a wide range of solvents, temperatures, and concentrations. Attractively, the highest gECL values up to 0.014 reported so far has been achieved for the CP&#8208;ECL emissions of the chiral pyrenophanes. Attributed to their unique structural features and outstanding CPL performances, these novel pyrenophanes could serve as promising platforms for both fundamental investigations on pyrene excimers and practical applications such as chiral sensing.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Amino Acid Crystals with Enhanced Piezoelectric Performance for Biodegradable Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amino acid crystals have emerged as promising piezoelectric materials for biodegradable and biocompatible sensors; however, their relatively low piezoelectric coefficients constrain practical applications. Here, we introduce a fluoro&#8208;substitution strategy to overcome this limitation and enhance the piezoelectric performance of amino acid crystals. Specifically, we substituted hydrogen atoms on the aromatic rings of L&#8208;tryptophan, L&#8208;phenylalanine, and N&#8208;Cbz&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine with fluorine, resulting in significantly elevated piezoelectric coefficients. Density functional theory calculations further indicate that fluorination strengthens polarization by modifying molecular dipole moments. Consequently, these fluoro&#8208;substituted crystals achieve piezoelectric coefficients of up to 50.36 pm/V, surpassing those of other organic piezoelectric materials such as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), poly(l&#8208;lactic acid) (PLLA), and gelatin. When integrated into flexible, biodegradable force sensors, the fluoro&#8208;substituted crystals exhibit a broad sensing range, high sensitivity, and stable in vivo operation over extended periods. This work establishes a versatile route for boosting piezoelectricity in biomaterials, thereby broadening their scope in biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Monitoring the Fate of Zn in the Cu/ZnO/ZrO2 Catalyst during CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Methanol Synthesis at High Conversions by Operando Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the frame of developing a sustainable chemical industry, heterogeneously catalyzed CO2 hydrogenation to methanol has attracted considerable interest. However, the Cu&#8208;Zn based catalyst system employed in this process is very dynamic, especially in the presence of the products methanol and water. Deactivation needs to be prevented, but its origin and mechanism are hardly investigated at high conversion where product condensation is possible. Here, we report on the structural dynamics of a Cu/ZnO/ZrO2 catalyst at 90 bar and 40% CO2 conversion (at equilibrium conditions), investigated in a dedicated metal&#8208;based spectroscopic cell specially fabricated using additive manufacturing. This particular reactor configuration aims to mimic the high CO2 conversion part of the catalyst bed and can induce product condensation, which is monitored by operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. While Cu remained mostly stable throughout the experiment, Zn underwent strong restructuring. The chosen reaction conditions, including the use of CO2 as carbon source and in situ product condensation, were selected to provide insights under industrial conditions. This work highlights the importance of spectroscopic investigations at high conversion levels, offering insights into chemical transformations during deactivation, extending the concept of spatially resolved studies, and thus providing guidance for the design of more stable catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Mesoporous Single&#8208;Crystal FeFe(CN)6 Microspheres for Superior Potassium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoporous single&#8208;crystalline FeFe(CN)6 microspheres are characterized by interconnected pores within the entire single&#8208;crystalline body, allowing the electrolyte to penetrate into the microspheres and alleviating side reactions. The resulting structurally unique FeFe(CN)6 cathode exhibits excellent rate capability of 86.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 3&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and stable cycling performance over 2000 cycles in potassium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Metal hexacyanoferrates (HCFs), also known as Prussian blue analogues, are ideal cathodes for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) due to their nontoxicity and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Nevertheless, obtaining metal HCF cathode materials with both long&#8208;term cycling stability and high rate performance remains a daunting challenge. In this study, we present mesoporous single&#8208;crystalline iron hexacyanoferrate (MSC&#8208;FeHCF) microspheres, featuring a single&#8208;crystalline structure that contains interconnected pores spanning the entire crystal lattice. This unique architecture not only enables the electrolyte to fully penetrate into the single crystal, but also shorten the K+ diffusion distance. Additionally, the confinement effect of mesopores on interior water mitigates the excessive side reactions. The stress during battery cycling can be dispersed through multiple paths to alleviate the internal strain. The MSC&#8208;FeHCF microspheres exhibit unprecedented long&#8208;term cycling performance, achieving a specific discharge capacity of 123.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 30&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 87.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, providing 85.8&#8201;% of the initial capacity. More importantly, the MSC&#8208;FeHCF microspheres exhibit high rate capability, delivering 86.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 3&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

&lt;p&gt;Mesoporous single-crystalline FeFe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; microspheres are characterized by interconnected pores within the entire single-crystalline body, allowing the electrolyte to penetrate into the microspheres and alleviating side reactions. The resulting structurally unique FeFe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; cathode exhibits excellent rate capability of 86.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 3&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and stable cycling performance over 2000 cycles in potassium-ion batteries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal hexacyanoferrates (HCFs), also known as Prussian blue analogues, are ideal cathodes for potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) due to their nontoxicity and cost-effectiveness. Nevertheless, obtaining metal HCF cathode materials with both long-term cycling stability and high rate performance remains a daunting challenge. In this study, we present mesoporous single-crystalline iron hexacyanoferrate (MSC-FeHCF) microspheres, featuring a single-crystalline structure that contains interconnected pores spanning the entire crystal lattice. This unique architecture not only enables the electrolyte to fully penetrate into the single crystal, but also shorten the K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion distance. Additionally, the confinement effect of mesopores on interior water mitigates the excessive side reactions. The stress during battery cycling can be dispersed through multiple paths to alleviate the internal strain. The MSC-FeHCF microspheres exhibit unprecedented long-term cycling performance, achieving a specific discharge capacity of 123.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 30&#8197;mA&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 87.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 2000 cycles at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, providing 85.8&#8201;% of the initial capacity. More importantly, the MSC-FeHCF microspheres exhibit high rate capability, delivering 86.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 3&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This study introduces an innovative strategy for engineering metal HCF cathode materials, thereby opening a novel avenue for the development of high-efficiency electrode materials for PIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Ethylene Purification from Ternary Mixture through Adaptive Recognition Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An adaptive microporous material with appropriate pore size and the match of electrostatic potentials shows excellent trace C2H2 and CO2 trapping capability at 0.01&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K with high C2H2/C2H4 and top&#8208;level CO2/C2H4 selectivity simultaneously, which can realize one&#8208;step record&#8208;high acquisition of C2H4 from ternary C2H2/CO2/C2H4 mixture under various conditions.







Abstract
One&#8208;step adsorptive purification of ethylene (C2H4) from ternary mixture comprising of acetylene (C2H2), ethylene (C2H4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) is a great challenge in the chemical industry. Herein, a microporous metal&#8211;organic framework (FJI&#8208;H38) has been reported, which possesses high&#8208;density electronegative O/N binding sites and appropriate pore size. Notably, at 0.01&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K FJI&#8208;H38 shows excellent trapping capability for C2H2 (1.64&#8197;mmol/g) and CO2 (2.33&#8197;mmol/g), while the uptake of C2H4 is only 0.41&#8197;mmol/g, which endows FJI&#8208;H38 high C2H2/C2H4 and top&#8208;level CO2/C2H4 selectivity simultaneously. Polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 (&#8805;99.95&#8201;%) with record&#8208;high productivity can be successfully obtained from ternary C2H2/CO2/C2H4 mixture in one step under various conditions. Even at 318&#8197;K, the separation performance has no obvious decrease. Such excellent separation performance is due to the adaptive recognition of C2H2 and CO2 by FJI&#8208;H38 through the synergistic effect of appropriate pore size and the match of electrostatic potentials, where C2H2 and CO2 can be stabilized by the O/N and aromatic ring sites.

NiNCs@Ni&#8208;Nx strengthening electrochemical CO2RR&#8208;to&#8208;CO. A comprehensive DFT calculation was performed to explore the effect of Ni nanoclusters on Ni&#8208;Nx (x=1,2,3,4) SACs and guided the successful synthesis of Ni6@Ni&#8208;N3 catalyst with high FECO (99.7&#8201;%) and TOF (83984.2&#8197;h&#8722;1) during CO2RR. The Ni6 nanoclusters can stabilize the unsaturated Ni&#8208;N3 sites and optimize the *COOH intermediate adsorption.







Abstract
Unsaturated Ni single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), Ni&#8208;Nx (x=1,2,3), have been investigated to break the conventional Ni&#8208;N4 structural limitation and provide more unoccupied 3d orbitals for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) intermediates adsorption, but their intrinsically low structural stability has seriously hindered their applications. Here, we developed a strategy by integrating Ni nanoclusters to stabilize unsaturated Ni&#8208;N3 atomic sites for efficient CO2 electroreduction to CO at industrial&#8208;level current. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the incorporation of Ni nanocluster effectively stabilizes the unsaturated Ni&#8208;N3 atomic sites and modulates their electronic structure to enhance the adsorption of the key intermediate *COOH during CO2RR. Guided by these insights, we prepared an optimal composite catalyst, Ni6@Ni&#8208;N3, which features a Ni6N6 nanocluster surrounded by six Ni&#8208;N3 single atoms sites, through low&#8208;temperature pyrolysis. The morphology and coordinative structure of Ni6@Ni&#8208;N3 were confirmed by an aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscope (AC&#8208;TEM) and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). As a result, Ni6@Ni&#8208;N3 demonstrated a remarkably high CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 99.7&#8201;% and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 83984.2&#8197;h&#8722;1 at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 under &#8722;1.15&#8197;VRHE, much better than those of Ni&#8208;N4 with a lower FECO of 86&#8201;% at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a TOF of 39309.9&#8197;h&#8722;1under identical potential. XAS analyses of Ni6@Ni&#8208;N3 before and after long&#8208;term CO2RR testing confirmed the excellent stability of its coordinative environment. This work highlights a generalizable approach for stabilizing unsaturated single&#8208;atom catalysts, paving the way for their application in high&#8208;performance CO2RR.

         <title>Engineering Covalent Aptamer Chimeras for Enhanced Autophagic Degradation of Membrane Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent aptamer chimeras (CApTEC) engineered with sulfonyl fluoride groups and an LC3 ligand has been developed for the targeted degradation of membrane proteins via the autophagy&#8208;lysosomal pathway. CApTECs form covalent bonds with target proteins, resulting in enhanced and prolonged protein degradation compared to the non&#8208;covalent designs, highlighting their potential for designing safe and effective therapeutics.







Abstract
Targeted degradation of membrane proteins represents an attractive strategy for eliminating pathogenesis&#8208;related proteins. Aptamer&#8208;based chimeras hold great promise as membrane protein degraders, however, their degradation efficacy is often hindered by the limited structural stability and the risk of off&#8208;target effects due to the non&#8208;covalent interaction with target proteins. We here report the first design of a covalent aptamer&#8208;based autophagosome&#8208;tethering chimera (CApTEC) for the enhanced autophagic degradation of cell&#8208;surface proteins, including transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and nucleolin (NCL). This strategy relies on the site&#8208;specific incorporation of sulfonyl fluoride groups onto aptamers to enable the cross&#8208;linking with target proteins, coupled with the conjugation of an LC3 ligand to hijack the autophagy&#8208;lysosomal pathway for targeted protein degradation. The chemically engineered CApTECs exhibit enhanced on&#8208;target retention and improved structural stability. Our results also demonstrate that CApTECs achieve remarkably enhanced and prolonged degradation of membrane proteins compared to the non&#8208;covalent designs. Furthermore, the CApTEC targeting TfR1 is combined with 5&#8208;fluorouracil (5&#8208;FU) for synergistic tumor therapy in a mouse model, leading to substantial suppression of tumor growth. Our strategy may provide deep insights into the LC3&#8208;mdiated autophagic degradation, affording a modular and effective strategy for membrane protein degradation and precise therapeutic applications.

Furthermore, the CApTEC targeting TfR1 is combined with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for synergistic tumor therapy in a mouse model, leading to substantial suppression of tumor growth. Our strategy may provide deep insights into the LC3-mdiated autophagic degradation, affording a modular and effective strategy for membrane protein degradation and precise therapeutic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hybrid CIGS&#8208;Cobalt Quaterpyridine Photocathode with Backside Illumination: A New Paradigm for Solar Fuel Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and selective solar&#8208;driven conversion of CO2 to CO has been achieved using a Cu(In,Ga)S2 chalcopyrite&#8208;based photocathode, coated with a cobalt molecular catalyst and operated under backside illumination. This innovative design addresses the challenges associated with the absorption properties of the catalyst and the protection layer, paving the way for high&#8208;performance and versatile photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices.







Abstract
Chalcogenide&#8208;based thin&#8208;film solar cell optimized for rear illumination and used for CO2 reduction is presented. Central to this innovation is a thinner, Cu(In,Ga)S2 chalcopyrite absorber coated with a robust metallic top layer, which potentially surpasses the performance of conventional front&#8208;illuminated designs. Using cobalt quaterpyridine molecular catalyst, photocurrent densities for CO2 reduction exceeding 10&#8197;mA/cm2 at 0.0&#8201;V vs. RHE under 1&#8197;Sun illumination, and ca. 16&#8197;mA/cm2 at &#8722;0.25&#8201;V vs. RHE were achieved in voltammetry experiments. Controlled potential electrolysis showed catalytic activity over 20&#8197;h with selectivity for CO ranging from &gt;92&#8201;% (first 4&#8197;hours) to 86&#8201;% at the end of the experiment. This approach opens limitless possibilities for employing various reduction catalysts, extending far beyond CO2 reduction. It imposes minimal constraints on absorption properties, immobilization methods, and catalyst nature, setting the stage for high&#8208;performance, adaptable PEC devices.

         <title>Photoinduced Late&#8208;Stage Radical Decarboxylative and Deoxygenative Coupling of Complex Carboxylic Acids and Their Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carboxylic acids serve as versatile building blocks in organic synthesis. This review highlights recent developments and trends in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex carboxylic acids and their derivatives enabled by visible light photocatalysis. It discusses a variety of radical decarboxylative and deoxygenative coupling reactions, with particular emphasis on the reaction mechanisms involved, as well as potential future directions for the field.







Abstract
The simple and efficient conversion of carboxylic acids into structurally diverse organic molecules is highly desirable in chemical synthesis. This review covers recent developments in photocatalytic methodology for late&#8208;stage transformations of complex carboxylic acids and their derivatives enabled by radical decarboxylation and deoxygenation, highlighting some representative and significant contributions in this field. These advancements are categorized based on the reactivity patterns exhibited by the carboxylic acids. Several activation modes to generate alkyl or aryl radical intermediates during decarboxylation of carboxylic acids are presented, namely, single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) oxidation, ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT), SET reduction, and energy transfer (EnT) processes. On the other hand, direct activation of C&#8722;O bonds in carboxylic acids mediated by phosphoranyl radicals has been discussed and illustrates their potential synthetic application for the synthesis of complex aldehydes, ketones and amides.

         <title>Elaborate Designed Three&#8208;Dimensional Hierarchical Conductive MOF/LDH/CF Nanoarchitectures for Superior Capacitive Deionization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides a facile method to fabricated hierarchical composite M&#8208;CAT/LDH/CF, the well&#8208;ordered NiCoCu&#8208;LDH acts as interior templates to create an interface by embedding c&#8208;MOFs and aligning two crystal lattice systems, facilitating the graft growth of c&#8208;MOFs/LDH heterostructures along the LDH. This improves ion accessibility, speeds up ion transfer, and enhances ion transport pathways for excellent desalination performance.







Abstract
Rational exploration of cost&#8208;effective, durable, and high&#8208;performance electrode materials is imperative for advancing the progress of capacitive deionization (CDI). The integration of multicomponent layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with conjugated conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (c&#8208;MOFs) to fabricate bifunctional heterostructure electrode materials is considered a complex but promising strategy. Herein, the fabrication of elaborately designed three&#8208;dimensional hierarchical conductive MOF/LDH/CF nanoarchitectures (M&#8211;CAT/LDH/CF) as CDI anodes via a controllable grafted&#8208;growth strategy is reported. In this assembly, carbon fiber (CF) provides exceptional electrical conductivity facilitating rapid ion transfer and acts as a sturdy foundation for even distribution of NiCoCu&#8208;LDH nanosheets. Moreover, the well&#8208;ordered NiCoCu&#8208;LDH further acts as interior templates to create an interface by embedding c&#8208;MOFs and aligning two crystal lattice systems, facilitating the graft growth of c&#8208;MOFs/LDH heterostructures along the LDH nanosheet arrays on CF, leading to accelerated ion diffusion kinetics. Density functional theory (DFT) confirms the unique structure of M&#8211;CAT/LDH/CF promotes interfacial charge transfer from NiCoCu&#8208;LDH to M&#8211;CAT. This enhancement accelerates ion transfer, decreases ion migration energy, and leads to better ion diffusion kinetics and a smoother Cl&#8722; shuttle. Accordingly, the asymmetrical M&#8211;CAT/LDH/CF cell exhibited superior specific capacitance (315 F g&#8722;1), excellent salt adsorption capacity (147.8&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1), rapid rate (21.1&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 min&#8722;1), and impressive cyclic stability (91.4&#8201;% retention rate). This work offers valuable insights for designing heterostructure electrode materials based on three&#8208;dimensional interconnected networks, contributing to further advancements in CDI technology.

         <title>Revealing the CO Tolerance Mechanism in Acidic Hydrogen Oxidation Reactions on Platinum&#8208;Based Catalyst Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed schematic of attenuating CO adsorption on the basis of oxidizing CO to enhance CO tolerance at platinum&#8208;based catalysts under acidic HOR can be outlined by in situ Raman spectroscopy.







Abstract
The presence of trace CO impurity gas in hydrogen fuel can rapidly deactivate platinum&#8208;based hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) catalysts due to poisoning effects, yet the precise CO tolerance mechanism remains debated. Our designed Au@PtX bifunctional core&#8211;shell nanocatalysts exhibit excellent performance of CO tolerance in acidic solution during HOR and possess exceptional Raman spectroscopy enhancement. Through capturing and analyzing in situ Raman spectroscopy evidences on *OH, metal&#8208;O species and *CO evolution under 0.3&#8197;V, we confirm that oxygen&#8208;containing species on PtRu and PtSn catalysts promote the oxidation and desorption of *CO. While Ru enhances *CO adsorption on Pt, the primary CO tolerance performance of PtRu arises from *CO oxidation via a bifunctional pathway. Additionally, electronic structure of Sn reduces *CO adsorption on Pt sites, complementing the bifunctional mechanism to further enhance the CO tolerance performance of PtSn. These discoveries significantly deepen our understanding of the anti&#8208;poisoning mechanism of Pt&#8208;based catalysts in the HOR process and offer valuable insights for rational catalyst design.

         <title>Dendritic Platinum Nanoparticles Shielded by Pt&#8208;S PEGylation as Intracellular Reactors for Bioorthogonal Uncaging Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioorthogonal platinum chemistry! Dendritic Pt nanoparticles shielded by Pt&#8722;S PEGylation demonstrated high biocompatibility and the capacity to mediate uncaging reactions in cancer cells, enabling the in situ release of anticancer drugs in 2D and 3D culture, and in vivo.







Abstract
Beyond their classical role as cytotoxics, Platinum (Pt) coordination complexes recently joined the selected group of transition metals capable of performing bioorthogonal reactions in living environments. To minimize their reactivity towards nucleophiles, which limit their catalytic performance, we investigated the use of Pt(0) with different forms, sizes and surface functionalization. We report herein the development of PEGylated Pt nanodendrites with the capacity to activate prodyes and prodrugs in cell culture and in vivo. Their dendritic morphology together with their surface shielding through Pt&#8722;S&#8208;bonded PEGylation synergistically contributed to create catalytic nanoreactors compatible with the highly&#8208;crowded and reductive environment of the cell cytoplasm, thereby facilitating in situ bioorthogonal drug uncaging in cancer cells in 2D and 3D culture, including in microfluidic systems, and xenografted in zebrafish.

     alt="Dendritic Platinum Nanoparticles Shielded by Pt-S PEGylation as Intracellular Reactors for Bioorthogonal Uncaging Chemistry"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bioorthogonal platinum chemistry&lt;/b&gt;! Dendritic Pt nanoparticles shielded by Pt&#8722;S PEGylation demonstrated high biocompatibility and the capacity to mediate uncaging reactions in cancer cells, enabling the in situ release of anticancer drugs in 2D and 3D culture, and in vivo.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond their classical role as cytotoxics, Platinum (Pt) coordination complexes recently joined the selected group of transition metals capable of performing bioorthogonal reactions in living environments. To minimize their reactivity towards nucleophiles, which limit their catalytic performance, we investigated the use of Pt(0) with different forms, sizes and surface functionalization. We report herein the development of PEGylated Pt nanodendrites with the capacity to activate prodyes and prodrugs in cell culture and in vivo. Their dendritic morphology together with their surface shielding through Pt&#8722;S-bonded PEGylation synergistically contributed to create catalytic nanoreactors compatible with the highly-crowded and reductive environment of the cell cytoplasm, thereby facilitating in situ bioorthogonal drug uncaging in cancer cells in 2D and 3D culture, including in microfluidic systems, and xenografted in zebrafish.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Proximal Protonation Source in Cu&#8208;NHx&#8208;C Single Atom Catalysts Selectively Boosts CO2 to Methane Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulating the coordination environment of active sites has proved powerful for tapping into their catalytic activity and selectivity in homogeneous catalysis, yet the heterogeneous nature of copper single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) makes it challenging. This work reports a bottom&#8208;up approach to construct a SAC (rGO@Cu&#8208;N(Hx)&#8208;C) by inlaying preformed amine coordinated Cu2+ units into reduced graphene oxide (rGO), permitting molecular level revelation on how the proximal N&#8208;site functional groups (N&#8208;H or N&#8208;CH3) impact on the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). It is demonstrated that the N&#8208;H moiety of rGO@Cu&#8208;NHx&#8208;C can serve as an in&#8208;situ protonation agent to accelerate the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methane reduction kinetics, delivering a methane current density (163 mA/cm2) 2.42&#8208;times that with the &#8208;CH3 substituted counterpart rGO@Cu&#8208;N&#8208;C. Operando spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations elucidate that the high methane faradaic efficiency (77.1%) achieved here is enabled by opening up the energetically favorable formyl pathway (*OCHO pathway) against the traditional *CO pathway that normally leads to various CO2RR products other than methane. Our strategy sets the stage to precisely modulate single&#8208;atom catalysts for efficient and selective electrochemical CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface&#8208;Confined Disordered Hydrogen Bonds Enable Efficient Lithium Transport in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State PEO&#8208;Based Lithium Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based electrolytes are essential to advance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) with high safety/energy density due to their inherent flexibility and scalability. However, the inefficient Li+ transport in PEO often leads to poor rate performance and diminished stability of the ASSLBs. The regulation of intermolecular H&#8208;bonds is regarded as one of the most effective approaches to enable efficient Li+ transport, while the practical performances are hindered by the electrochemical instability of free H&#8208;bond donors and the constrained mobility of highly ordered H&#8208;bonding structures. To overcome these challenges, we develop a surface&#8208;confined disordered H&#8208;bond system with stable donor&#8208;acceptor interactions to construct a loosened chain segments/ions arrangement in the bulk phase of PEO&#8208;based electrolytes, realizing the crystallization inhibition of PEO, weak coordination of Li+ and entrapment of anions, which are conducive to efficient Li+ transport and stable Li+ deposition. The rationally designed LiFePO4&#8208;based ASSLB demonstrates a long cycle&#8208;life of over 400 cycles at 1.0 C and 65 &#176;C with a capacity retention rate of 87.5%, surpassing most of the currently reported polymer&#8208;based ASSLBs. This work highlights the importance of confined disordered H&#8208;bonds on Li+ transport in an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery system, paving the way for the future design of polymer&#8208;based ASSLBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Shifting Lithium Amide Reactivity to the Radical Domain: Regioselective Radical C&#8208;H Functionalization of 3&#8208;Iodooxetane for the Synthesis of 1,5&#8208;Dioxaspiro[2.3]hexanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strained spiro&#8208;heterocycles (SSH) have gained significant attention within the medicinal chemistry community as promising (sp3)&#8208;rich bioisosteres for their aromatic and non&#8208;spirocyclic counterparts. We herein report access to an unprecedented spiro&#8208;heterocycle &#8208; 1,5&#8208;dioxaspiro[2.3]hexane. Our synthetic approach leverages a lithium&#8208;amide induced single&#8208;electron transfer to benzophenones generating an N&#8208;centered radical and a ketyl radical anion &#8208; reminiscent of a frustrated radical pair. This pair works synergistically to selectively abstract the &#946;&#8208;hydrogen from 3&#8208;iodooxetane, initiating an exergonic radical&#8208;radical coupling reaction. This process enables the formation of the desired bond between the oxetane core and benzophenone derivatives, ultimately yielding the novel 1,5&#8208;dioxaspiro[2.3]hexane core. The stability and synthetic utility of the novel 1,5&#8208;dioxaspiro[2.3]hexane motif are showcased. An in&#8208;depth mechanistic investigation is presented, including cyclic voltammetry studies, as well as computational calculations and experiments to support the mechanism of this new single electron synthetic tactic.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;monotonic Variation of Potential&#8208;dependent Surface Diffusion at Electrochemical Interfaces in the Presence of Coadsorbates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The influence of coadsorbed ions on adsorbate diffusion, an inherent effect at solid&#8208;liquid interfaces, was studied for adsorbed sulfur on Ag(100) electrodes in the presence of bromide or iodide. Quantitative in situ high&#8208;speed scanning tunnelling microscopy (video&#8208;STM) measurements were performed both in the potential regime of the c(2&#215;2) halide adlayer at its saturation coverage and in the regime of a disordered adlayer where the halide coverage increases with potential. These studies reveal a surprising non&#8208;monotonic potential dependence of Sad diffusion with an initial increase with halide coverage, followed by a decrease upon halide adlayer ordering into the c(2&#215;2) structure. Density functional
theory (DFT) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations only qualitatively reproduce the rise in Sad mobility with halide coverage, suggesting that many&#8208;adsorbate interactions and the presence of the electrolyte need to be considered.</dc:description>

         <title>Ph3PC &#8211; A Monosubstituted C(0) Atom in Its Triplet State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study introduces a novel class of carbon&#8208;centered diradicals: a monosubstituted C&#8208;atom stabilized by a phosphine. The diradical Ph3P&#8594;C was photochemically generated from a diazophosphorus ylide precursor (Ph3PCN2) and characterized by EPR and isotope&#8208;sensitive ENDOR spectroscopy at low temperatures. Ph3P&#8594;C features an axial zero&#8208;field splitting parameter D = 0.543 cm&#8722;1 with a vanishingly small rhombicity |E|/D = 0.002. Time&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent measurements confirm a triplet ground state with a lifetime of approximately 10 min at 127 K in toluene&#8208;d8. Multireference electronic structure calculations predict a clear triplet ground state with a singlet&#8208;triplet gap greater than 20 kcal/mol. In contrast to divalent C(0) compounds, such as Ph3P&#8594;C&#8592;PPh3, in which carbon needs excitation into a highly&#8208;excited closed&#8208;shell 2s02p4 configuration, Ph3P&#8594;C can be explained by direct involvement of carbon in its natural 3P state arising from the 2s22p2 configuration.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Perovskite Surface Energetics Through Tuneable Ferrocene Interlayers for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional ferrocene (Fc)&#8208;based interlayers have been developed to exhibit adjustable passivating and electrochemical characteristics within inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs).

Achieving rational control over chemical and energetic properties at the perovskite/electron transport layer (ETL) interface is crucial for realizing highly efficient and stable next&#8208;generation inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). To address this, we developed multifunctional ferrocene (Fc)&#8208;based interlayers engineered to exhibit adjustable passivating and electrochemical characteristics. These interlayers are designed to reduce non&#8208;radiative recombination, and to modulate the work function (WF) and uniformity of the perovskite surface, thereby enhancing device performance. The key role played by the highest occupied molecular orbital energies (EHOMO) of the Fc compounds relative to the perovskite valance band maximum (EVBM) is revealed. This relationship is pivotal in controlling band bending and optimizing charge extraction. Notably, the conformationally flexible and more easily oxidized ferrocenyl&#8208;bis&#8208;furyl&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate (2) is found to more effectively bind with undercoordinated Pb2+ surface sites and modulate interfacial energetics, resulting in inverted PSCs achieving champion efficiencies of 25.16&#8201;%. These cells also displayed excellent stability, retaining &gt;92&#8201;% of the initial efficiency after 1,000&#8197;h of maximum power point operation at 65&#8201;&#176;C. By correlating the broadly tunable Fc&#8208;EHOMO with a decreased and homogenized perovskite surface WF, our work advances our understanding of Fc&#8208;based interlayers and opens new pathways for their application in high&#8208;efficiency solar technologies.

         <title>Manipulating Charge Distribution at Organic&#8208;inorganic Interface via Optimizing Substituents for Sustainable Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The organic&#8211;inorganic interfaces constructed by CoS and substituent&#8208;modified phthalocyanine nanosheets (CoPc&#8208;g) can precisely regulate spatial electric field intensity by controlling charge transfer, thus optimizing the electronic structure of interfacial dual active sites. As a result, CoPc&#8208;CH3/CoS with the strongest space charge region possesses the best performance and stability.







Abstract
The space charge effect induced by high&#8208;quality heterojunctions is essential for efficient electrocatalytic processes. Herein, we delicately manipulate intermolecular charge transfer by modifying substituents (&#8722;g=&#8208;CH3, &#8208;H, &#8208;NO2) with various electron donating/withdrawing capabilities in CoPc&#8208;g/CoS organic&#8211;inorganic heterostructures. CoPc&#8208;CH3, as a typical electron donor, transfers more electrons to CoS due to the presence of &#8208;CH3, forming the strongest space electric field and thus regulating the dual active sites at the interface. Furthermore, oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates preferentially adsorb on the positively charged CoPc&#8208;CH3 side, and the rapid accumulation of electrons on the CoS side decelerates catalyst dissolution at the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) potential, ensuring the stable OER process under the optimized adsorbate evolution mechanism. As a result, CoPc&#8208;CH3/CoS catalyst exhibits the lowest overpotential and remains stable for 150&#8197;h at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in the membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer. The method provides a novel strategy for accurately regulating the space electric field of heterojunctions.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;guided Modulation of Li+ Solvation Structures towards Optimal Electrolyte Systems for High&#8208;performance Li&#8208;O2 Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As the "blood" of Li&#8208;O2 batteries (LOBs), electrolytes with various solvation structures of Li+ can greatly influence the composition of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on anode and the growth kinetics of Li2O2 on cathode, and further the battery performance. However, achieving delicate modulation of the multi&#8208;composition electrolytes remains significantly challenging to simultaneously give consideration to both the anode and cathode reactions. In this work, we employed Bayesian optimization to develop advanced electrolytes for LOBs, enabling the formation of a stable inorganic&#8208;rich SEI, and modulation of Li2O2 morphologies. Thus obtained LOBs using the optimized dual&#8208;solvent electrolyte could deliver a discharge capacity of 14,063 mAh g&#8722;1 at a current density of 500 mA g&#8722;1, which is far higher than those using the single&#8208;solvent electrolytes. This study not only highlights the critical role of the solvation structure for improving the battery performance, but also provides new insights and important theoretical guidance for delicate modulation of electrolyte compositions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>To enable highly efficient in situ hydrogen release from methanol/water reforming at lower temperature, the integration of solar&#8208;energy offers a promising approach to activate methanol/water and substantially lower the activation energy of this reaction. Herein, we present a novel dual&#8208;vacancy defective hollow heterostructure derived from Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks, featuring abundant surface hydroxyl groups and S/O vacancies, for photothermal&#8208;promoted methanol solution reforming into hydrogen. The [In2S3&#8208;x/In2O3&#8208;x](OH)y exhibits exceptional photothermal H2 evolution activity, achieving a production rate of 215.2 mmolgcat&#8208;1h&#8208;1, 16&#8208;fold higher than its thermocatalytic activity, with an apparent quantum efficiency of 66.8% and solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency of 6.5% at 365 nm and excellent durability over 82 h, cumulating 2.61&#215;103 mmolgcat&#8208;1. The synergistic effects of dual&#8208;vacancies and the hollow heterostructure significantly enhance the photothermal effect, lowering the activation energy barrier for methanol/water, enabling H2 production at temperatures even as 80 &#176;C under non&#8208;alkaline conditions. Furthermore, the incorporated surface hydroxyl groups facilitate the generation of active surface hydroxyls from water, further driving activation and cleavage of C&#8208;H bonds in methanol, thereby markedly reducing the apparent reaction activation energy by 12.5 %.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photoelectrocatalytic method is presented that achieves direct decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8211;P coupling, providing a modular route to alkylphosphinates and alkylphosphonates from readily available carboxylic acids. The success of this reaction hinges on the synergistic combination of electrochemical anodic oxidation and photocatalytic ligand to metal charge transfer (LMCT) decarboxylation. By employing P(III) reagents as limiting reagents, our approach enables efficient alkyl modification of medicinally important nucleosides and complex molecules derived phosphonites, which were challenging to access by existing methods. Detailed mechanistic studies elucidate the critical roles of Fe catalysts and additives, offering valuable insights into the reaction pathway and laying the foundation for future advancements in photoelectrocatalytic C(sp3)&#8211;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymer Ligands with Multi&#8208;Nitrogen Heterocyclic Carbenes for Enhanced Stability and Reactivity in Nanoparticle Surface Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are emerging as effective substitutes for conventional thiol ligands in surface functionalization of nanoparticles (NPs), offering exceptional stability to NPs under harsh conditions. However, the highly reactive feature of NHCs limits their use in introducing chemically active groups onto the NP surface. Herein, we develop a general yet robust strategy for the efficient surface functionalization of NPs with copolymer ligands bearing various functional groups. The polymer ligands consist of a multiple NHCs block, utilized for surface binding on NPs, alongside a poly(reactive ester) block intended for incorporating functional groups. The multiple NHCs block enables NPs with excellent colloidal stability across a broader range of pH values (0&#8208;14), temperature variations (&#8211;78&#176;C&#8208;100&#176;C), and electrolyte concentrations (0&#8208;1000 mM). Through the in situ ammonolysis of the poly(reactive ester) block, various active functional groups can be individually or together introduced on the NP surface. We further demonstrate the chemical reactivity of these functionalized NPs, including addition polymerization, Diels&#8208;Alder and Schiff base reactions. This method is applicable to various types of NPs, including metal NPs, metal oxide NPs, and even upconversion NPs, thereby paving new pathways for the design and creation of nanoparticle&#8208;based functional materials.</dc:description>

The multiple NHCs block enables NPs with excellent colloidal stability across a broader range of pH values (0-14), temperature variations (&#8211;78&#176;C-100&#176;C), and electrolyte concentrations (0-1000 mM). Through the in situ ammonolysis of the poly(reactive ester) block, various active functional groups can be individually or together introduced on the NP surface. We further demonstrate the chemical reactivity of these functionalized NPs, including addition polymerization, Diels-Alder and Schiff base reactions. This method is applicable to various types of NPs, including metal NPs, metal oxide NPs, and even upconversion NPs, thereby paving new pathways for the design and creation of nanoparticle-based functional materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Reconstruction of An Integrated CoO&#8208;Co2Mo3O8 electrode Enabling Efficient Ampere&#8208;Level Hydrogen Evolution in Alkaline Water or Seawater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To accelerate the water dissociation in the Volmer step and alleviate the destruction of bubbles to the physical structure of catalysts during the alkaline hydrogen evolution, an integrated electrode of cobalt oxide and cobalt&#8208;molybdenum oxide grown on Ni foam, named CoO&#8208;Co2Mo3O8, is designed. This integrated electrode enhances the catalyst&#8208;substrate interaction confirmed by a micro&#8208;indentation tester, and thus hinders the destruction of the physical structure of catalysts caused by bubbles. Electrochemical testing shows the occurrence of a surface reconstruction of the integrated electrode, and CoO is transformed into Co(OH)2, denoted as Co(OH)2&#8208;Co2Mo3O8. Theoretical calculations determine that Co(OH)2&#8208;Co2Mo3O8 has significantly low activation barrier for water dissociation and presents easy hydroxide desorption, which accelerate the catalytic reaction. Electrochemical experiments show that Co(OH)2&#8208;Co2Mo3O8 exhibits outstanding activity, reaching current density values of &#8722;100 and &#8722;1000 mA cm&#8722;2 with overpotentials only 57.8 and 195.8 mV, respectively. Furthermore, it demonstrates excellent stability at &#8722;500 and &#8722;1000 mA cm&#8722;2 for 200 h. Combined with the previously reported anode, the two&#8208;electrode system also provides the stable operation from 100 to 1000 mA cm&#8722;2 for 600 h in alkaline solution, and over 200 h at 500 and 1000 mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline seawater.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Identification of Native Peptides with Posttranslational Proline Hydroxylation by Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydroxylation, an extensive post&#8208;translational modification on proline, is critical for the modulation of protein structures, further dominating their functions in life systems. However, current mass spectrometry&#8208;based identification, could hardly distinguish hydroxylation from neighboring oxidation due to the same mass shifts, as well as challenges posed by low abundance and exogenous oxidation during sample preparation. To address these, an engineered nanopore was designed, capable of discriminating single hydroxyl group, to achieve the identification of proline hydroxylation on individual native peptides directly in the mixture. By modeling the interactions between hydroxylated proline and its specific recognition protein, we introduced a hydrophobic region in aerolysin lumen with A224Y/T274W mutations to enhance the sensitivity for proline residue. The results showed that proline hydroxylation on native HIF&#8208;1&#945; fragments could be unambiguously identified without purification, which could be maintained even in the presence of neighboring oxidation. The voltage&#8208;dependent experiments further demonstrated more relaxed peptide structures induced by hydroxylation, supporting the great impact of hydroxylation on chemical properties of proline and the molecular mechanism of the specific recognition for hydroxylated peptides in nature. These findings highlight the potential of nanopore for precise hydroxylation detection, offering a reliable platform for further uncovering the related functions in biological systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous 3d&#8208;4f Coordination Clusters for Selective Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein two families of porous coordination clusters (PCCs) with 216 nuclearity (M120RE96 or PCC&#8208;216MR) and 300 nuclearity (Co144Gd156 or PCC&#8208;300CG). For the first family M could be either nickel or cobalt, and RE = Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, and Gd; while the latter features the highest nuclearity of transition&#8208;rare earth metal clusters. Characterized by their cube&#8208;like, hollow structures, these clusters exhibit the ability to absorb N2 and CO2. Besides, these clusters can be dissolved in both aqueous and acetonitrile/methanol solutions, and capable of acting as homogeneous catalysts for converting CO2 to CO under visible light. The gadolinium analogues of these clusters all show turnover numbers over 10000 and turnover frequencies over 1 s&#8722;1. In particular, the nickel based bimetallic cluster (PCC&#8208;216NG) demonstrates near ly 100% selectivity for the reduction product, which may open a new direction for the design and development of PCCs based catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic&#8208;Free Synthesis of High&#8208;Silica Zeolite Y with Aluminophosphate as the Aluminum Carrier</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The wide application of zeolite Y in petrochemical industry is well known as one of the milestones in zeolite chemistry and heterogeneous catalysis. However, the traditional organic&#8208;free synthesis typically produces (hydro)thermally unstable zeolite Y with Si/Al atomic ratio (SAR) less than 2.5. Inspired by drug delivery process in which active components are kinetically controlled released, we develop a unique approach based on the pre&#8208;synthesized aluminum carrier to prepare one of the most siliceous zeolite Y with SAR up to 3.44 without using organics. The crystalline or amorphous aluminophosphates serve as the ideal carrier for the controlled incorporation of Al into zeolite framework during zeolite Y crystallization. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the partial introduction of aluminophosphate as Al source would rationally regulate the crystallization kinetics, facilitating the formation of high&#8208;silica zeolite Y with random Al distribution. This approach enhances the hydrothermal stability and catalytic performance of zeolite Y in benchmark reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of Oligosaccharide Isomers Using Electrostatically Asymmetric OmpF Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycans, unlike uniformly charged DNA and compositionally diverse peptides, are typically uncharged and exhibit rich stereoisomeric diversity in the glycosidic bonds between two monosaccharide units. This heterogeneity of charge and the structural complexity present significant challenges for accurate analysis. Herein, we developed a novel single&#8208;molecule oligosaccharide sensor, OmpF nanopore. The natural electroosmotic flow within OmpF provides robust driving force for unlabeled neutral oligosaccharides, accomplishing a detection concentration as low as 6.4 &#956;M. Furthermore, the asymmetric constriction zone of OmpF was employed to construct a stereoselective recognition site, enabling sensitive identification of glycosidic bond differences in cell lysate samples. Assisted by machine learning algorithms, a recognition accuracy of 99.9% for tetrasaccharides differing in only one glycosidic bond was achieved. This nanopore sensor offers a highly sensitive analytical tool with a broad dynamic range for the chiral recognition of oligosaccharides at low concentrations, applicable to both low&#8208;abundance and  practical samples.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting CO2 Hydrogenation by Synergistic Incorporation of Pure Slica Silicalite&#8208;1 Zeolite and CeO2 into Cu Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical conversion of CO2 is providing an opportunity to mitigate the global warming induced by the overconsumption of fossil fuel. Cu has been regarded as one of the most powerful contenders in catalyzing CO2 conversion, yet the precise manipulation of its surface state and the nearby chemical environment continues to pose a formidable challenge. In this work, we report a high&#8208;efficiency catalyst by utilizing CeO2 and pure silicon zeolite (S1) to co&#8208;activate Cu species.. In CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methanol (CTM) conversion, the space&#8208;time yield of methanol (STYMeOH) of the obtained CuCe/S1 catalysts reaches 87.18 g kgCu&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, which represents a sixfold increase compared to that of the Cu/CeO2 catalysts. The following mechanistic investigations reveal that S1 serves as a pivotal stabilizer for the small&#8208;sized CeO2 particles, thereby significantly enhancing the synergistic interaction between Cu species and CeO2. The crafted interaface possesses abundant oxygen vacancies and a high content of Cu+, significantly enhancing the adsorption of CO2 and inhibiting the formation of CO. Our discovery presents a promising new direction for catalyst upgrading and performance enhancement for CTM processes in the foreseeable future.</dc:description>

         <title>All&#8208;in&#8208;One Photoacid Generators with Green/Red&#8208;light Responsiveness and Cooperative Functionality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoacid generators (PAGs) are invaluable molecular tools that exhibited tremendous potential in emerging interdisciplinary researches of life&#8208;science, nanotechnology and smart materials. However, current PAGs are primarily mono&#8208;functional in terms of acid generation and rely on UV/deep&#8208;blue light excitation, posing a fundamental hurdle to their broader adoption. Developing cooperatively functioned PAGs with long&#8208;wavelength light responsiveness presents a formidable challenge due to the absence of suitable molecular scaffolds. Here, we introduce a newly&#8208;developed perylene bisimides PAG motif (PBI&#8208;PAG) that integrates desired multi&#8208;functionality and visible&#8208;light photo&#8208;reactivity. Taking advantages of characteristic opto&#8208;electronic properties of PBI scaffold, PBI&#8208;PAGs are capable of quantitative releasing (&gt; 99%) a palette of acids upon green/red light (560&#8208;605 nm) excitation. Concurrently, a photo&#8208;generated counterpart is functioned as a photo&#8208;sensitizer that could perform cooperatively with acid as an anti&#8208;metastasis cancer therapy agent. These two processes constitute the first example of a cooperatively functioned PAG operated at substrate&#8208;adaptive wavelengths.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Axially Chiral Dialdehydes via Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8722;H Amidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving axially chiral biaryl dialdehydes through asymmetric catalysis remains significantly challenging due to the lack of efficient strategies. In this report, we developed a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H amidation through chiral transient directing group strategy. With this new approach, a series of axially chiral amido dialdehydes were achieved in up to 86% yields with 99.5:0.5 er. Furthermore, detailed mechanistic studies indicated that both the imine formation and C&#8722;H bond cleavage steps were reversible. More interestingly, the X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of Int&#8208;2 showed probable C&#8722;H/&#960; interaction between biaryl group and chiral amine moiety. This process offered a convenient route to access axially chiral dialdehyde derivatives. More broadly, it demonstrated a new tool through transient and C&#8722;H/&#960; synergistic interactions, which would stimulate further development of asymmetric catalytic system in enantioselective C&#8722;H functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>A Stable Open&#8208;Shelled Au26 Nanocluster with Remarkable Performance in Selective Oxidation of Benzyl Alcohol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Open metal sites are crucial in catalysis. We have used a &#8220;loose coordination strategy&#8221; (LCS) to preorganize open metal sites in gold cluster catalysts. A gold nanocluster with composition of [Au26(3,4&#8208;Me2&#8208;Ph&#8208;form)9(iPr2&#8208;imy)3(Me2S)](BF4)2(iPr2&#8208;imy = 1,3&#8208;Diisopropylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, 3,4&#8208;Me2&#8208;Ph&#8208;form = N,N'&#8208;Di(3,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;phenyl)formamidine) (Au26) has been obtained by one pot synthesis, i.e. the direct reduction of Me2SAuCl in the presence of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes and amidinate ligands. ESI&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS reveals that the Me2S ligand is detached from the cluster to form open sites. The accessibility of the exposed Au atoms has been confirmed quantitatively by luminescent titration with 2&#8208;naphthalenethiol. Surprisingly,Au26has 15 valence electrons, and the presence of an unpaired electron is confirmed by superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). This open&#8208;shelledAu26not only shows unexpected high stability but also exhibits excellent catalytic performance toward the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, achieving a remarkable turnover number up to 100670.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Acid Hardness Nature of Cu Catalyst for Selective Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) in alkaline electrolyte presents a sustainable pathway for energy storage and green ammonia (NH3) synthesis. However, it remains challenging to obtain high activity and selectivity due to the limited protonation and/or desorption processes of key intermediates. Herein, we propose a strategy to regulate the acid hardness nature of Cu catalyst by introducing appropriate modifier. Using density functional theory calculations, we firstly identified that the BaO&#8208;modified Cu showed optimal Gibbs free energies for key NO3RR steps, including the protonation of *NO and the desorption of *NH3. Experimentally, the BaO&#8208;modified Cu catalyst exhibited 97.3% Faradaic efficiency (FE) for NH3 with a yield rate of 356.9 mmol h&#8208;1 gcat&#8208;1. It could also maintain high activity across a wide range of applied potentials and nitrate substrate concentrations. Detailed experimental and theoretical studies revealed that the Ba species could modulate the local electronic states of Cu, enhance the electron transfer rate, and optimize the adsorption/protonation/desorption processes of the N&#8208;containing intermediates, leading to the excellent catalytic performance for NO3&#8208;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Cyclopropanation of Unactivated Alkenes with Methylene Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopropanes are prevalent in natural products, pharmaceuticals, and bioactive compounds, functioning as a significant structural motif. Although a series of methods have been developed for the construction of the cyclopropane skeleton, the development of a direct and efficient strategy for the rapid synthesis of cyclopropanes from bench&#8208;stable starting materials with a broad substrate scope and functional group tolerance remains challenging and highly desirable. Herein, we present an electrochemical method for the direct cyclopropanation of unactivated alkenes using active methylene compounds. The strategy shows a broad substrate scope with a high level of functional group compatibility, as well as potential application as demonstrated by late&#8208;stage cyclopropanation of complex molecules and drug derivatives. Further mechanistic investigations suggest that Cp2Fe (Fc) plays an essential role as an oxidative mediator in generating radicals from active methylene compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Overall Water Splitting Dominated by Direct Ligand&#8208;to&#8208;Cluster Photoexcitation in Metal&#8722;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Expanding the spectral response of photocatalysts to facilitate overall water splitting (OWS) represents an effective approach for improving solar spectrum utilization efficiency. However, the majority of single&#8208;phase photocatalysts designed for OWS primarily respond to the ultraviolet region, which accounts for a small proportion of sunlight. Herein, we present a versatile strategy to achieve broad visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive OWS photocatalysis dominated by direct ligand&#8208;to&#8208;cluster charge transfer (LCCT) within metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Three synthesized OWS MOFs, namely Fe2MCbz (M2+ = Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+), exhibited intrinsic OWS capability without the requirement for extra photosensitizer or sacrificial agent or cocatalyst. Among these, Fe2NiCbz was identified as the superior performer, and when dispersed with polyacrylonitrile nanofibers using electrospinning technology, it achieved the highest OWS rates of 170.2 and 85.1 &#956;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1 for H2 and O2 evolution, surpassing all previously documented MOF&#8208;based photocatalysts. Experimental and theoretical analyses revealed that direct LCCT played a crucial role in enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency, with exceptional performance of Fe2NiCbz attributed to its well&#8208;optimized energy level structures and highly efficient charge transfer mechanism.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Expanding the spectral response of photocatalysts to facilitate overall water splitting (OWS) represents an effective approach for improving solar spectrum utilization efficiency. However, the majority of single-phase photocatalysts designed for OWS primarily respond to the ultraviolet region, which accounts for a small proportion of sunlight. Herein, we present a versatile strategy to achieve broad visible-light-responsive OWS photocatalysis dominated by direct ligand-to-cluster charge transfer (LCCT) within metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Three synthesized OWS MOFs, namely Fe2MCbz (M2+ = Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+), exhibited intrinsic OWS capability without the requirement for extra photosensitizer or sacrificial agent or cocatalyst. Among these, Fe2NiCbz was identified as the superior performer, and when dispersed with polyacrylonitrile nanofibers using electrospinning technology, it achieved the highest OWS rates of 170.2 and 85.1 &#956;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1 for H2 and O2 evolution, surpassing all previously documented MOF-based photocatalysts. Experimental and theoretical analyses revealed that direct LCCT played a crucial role in enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency, with exceptional performance of Fe2NiCbz attributed to its well-optimized energy level structures and highly efficient charge transfer mechanism. This work not only sets a benchmark in OWS MOF photocatalysts but also paves the way for maximizing solar spectrum utilization, thereby advancing renewable hydrogen production strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Interface Engineering with Large &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Molecules Enables Durable Zn Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Undesirable dendrite growth and side reactions at the electrical double layer (EDL) of Zn/electrolyte interface are critical challenges limiting the performance of aqueous zinc ion batteries. Through density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that grafting large &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules (e.g. bilirubin, biliverdin, lumirubin, and hemoglobin) onto Zn surface induces preferential adsorption on non&#8208;(002) facets, leading to interfacial charge redistribution, upshifted Zn d&#8208;band center, and enhanced H+ fixation capability. Among these, bilirubin (BR) is identified as the most effective, preferentially adsorbing onto non&#8208;Zn(002) facets to inhibit hydrogen evolution reaction and promote Zn(002) planar growth during plating. This approach results in average Coulombic efficiency of 99.86% over 4000 cycles in Zn||BR&#8208;1@Cu cells and prolonged lifespan exceeding 1600 h in BR&#8208;1@Zn||BR&#8208;1@Zn cells at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and 1 mAh cm&#8722;2. Even under harsh condition of 25 mA cm&#8722;2 and 10 mAh cm&#8722;2, BR&#8208;1@Zn||BR&#8208;1@Zn cell maintains a lifespan of over 400 h. Furthermore, BR&#8208;1@Zn||MnO2 and BR&#8208;1@Zn||NVO full cells achieve 76.4% and 86.1% capacity retention after 800 and 1400 cycles at 1.0 A g&#8722;1, respectively. This study underscores the importance of grafting large &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules to allow selective Zn(002) exposure, Zn d&#8208;band center upshift, and EDL structure regulation, paving the way towards durable Zn anodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Multicatalytic Decarbonylation of Aldehydes Driven by Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A metal&#8208;free dual photo&#8208; and organocatalytic decarbonylation of aliphatic aldehydes is described for the first time. On the one hand, a wide range of tertiary aldehydes are smoothly decarbonylated thanks to the combination of thioxanthone as photocatalyst and diphenyl disulfide as organocatalyst. On the other hand, by simply using 4&#8208;CzIPN as photocatalyst instead of thioxanthone, various secondary aldehydes readily undergo decarbonylation in an orthogonal manner, via the in situ formation of 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines. Both methodologies are compatible with various functional groups and are readily applied to the decarbonylation of complex molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Lanthanide&#8208;controlled protein switches: development and in vitro and in vivo applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lanthanides, which are part of the rare earth elements group have numerous applications in electronics, medicine and energy storage.&#160; However, our ability to extract them is not meeting the rapidly increasing demand. The discovery of the bacterial periplasmic lanthanide&#8208;binding protein lanmodulin spurred significant interest in developing biotechnological routes for lanthanide detection and extraction. Here we report the construction of b&#8208;lactamase&#8208;lanmodulin chimeras that function as lanthanide&#8208;controlled enzymatic switches. Optimized switches demonstrated dynamic ranges approaching 3000&#8208;fold and could accurately quantify lanthanide ions in simple colorimetric or electrochemical assays. E.coli cells expressing such chimeras grow on b&#8208;lactam antibiotics only in the presence of lanthanide ions. The developed lanthanide&#8208;controlled protein switches represent a novel platform for engineering metal&#8208;binding proteins for biosensing and microbial engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Reaction of NHOs with Bisphosphanes &#8211; Designing Diradicaloids, Zwitterions and Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The linkage of an imidazole&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin (NHO), containing a terminal CH2 donor group, with a phosphorus&#8208;centered diradical molecular fragment leads to an open&#8208;shell singlet diphospha&#8208;indenylide system, a new class of P&#8208;heterocycles, which can be interpreted both as a phosphorus&#8208;centered diradicaloid and as a zwitterion with a permanent, overall charge separation between the N&#8208; and P&#8208;heterocyclic ring systems. The rotation of the imidazole ring, which is thermally possible due to a central C&#8208;C bond with a weakened &#960;&#8208;component, changes both the charge separation and diradical character depending on the dihedral angle, as quantum mechanical calculations indicate. By varying the bulkiness of substituents at the imidazole&#8208;based NHO, it was possible to obtain different diphospha&#8208;indenylide species with different rotation angles in the solid state and hence varying diradical character. Imidazolium&#8208;diphospha&#8208;indenyli&#173;des represent a new class of NHO&#8208;based zwitterions with diradical character. Their synthesis, structure, and activation chemistry are described, as well as the quantum mechanical description of the electronic structure in these unusual heterocycles. In addition, along the synthesis route to diphospha&#8208;indenylide, we also succeeded in isolating a highly reactive monoradical anion, which was also fully characterized.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Trifluoromethylazidation of Styrenyl Olefins Catalyzed by an Engineered Nonheme Iron Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organofluorines, particularly those containing trifluoromethyl (CF3) groups, play a critical role in medicinal chemistry. While trifluoromethylation of alkenes provides a powerful synthetic route to construct CF3&#8208;containing compounds with broad structural and functional diversity, achieving enantioselective control in these reactions remains a formidable challenge. In this study, we engineered a nonheme iron enzyme, quercetin 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase from Bacillus subtilis (BsQueD), for the enantioselective trifluoromethylazidation of alkenes. Through directed evolution, the final variant BsQueD&#8208;CF3 exhibited excellent enantioselectivity, with an enantiomeric ratio (e.r.) of up to 98:2. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest the involvement of radical intermediates. This work expands biocatalytic organofluorine chemistry by reprogramming metalloenzymes for innovative trifluoromethylation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination Self&#8208;Assembly Induced Hot Exciton Fluorescence and Multi&#8208;Source Excitation Long Afterglow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic complexes with long afterglow luminescence have attracted extensive attention due to potential applications in display, sensing and information security. However, most of the metal&#8208;organic complex long afterglow materials reported so far are limited to the use of UV light as the excitation source, and the ambiguity of the structure&#8208;activity relationship makes the development of metal&#8208;organic complexes extremely limited. Herein, a series of metal&#8208;organic complexes with ultralong emission lifetime is constructed by coordination assembly of Zn(II) with three isomers. These complexes can emit afterglow when excited by UV light, blue LED, cell phone flashlight or even near&#8208;infrared light (800 nm) under ambient conditions, and the afterglow is also observed at 360 K. More interestingly, the inactivation pathway of the triplet exciton was altered by the strategy of supramolecular self&#8208;assembly, which leads to these complexes having hot exciton fluorescence (HEF) emission that is not present in the ligand. The relationship between structure and optical properties is investigated in detail by experiments and theoretical calculations. This work provides guidance for studying the modulation of optical properties by coordination interactions.</dc:description>

The relationship between structure and optical properties is investigated in detail by experiments and theoretical calculations. This work provides guidance for studying the modulation of optical properties by coordination interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Operando Nanoscale Characterization Reveals Fe Doping of Ni Oxide Enhances Oxygen Evolution Reaction via Fragmentation and Formation of Dual Active Sites.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient catalytic water splitting demands advanced catalysts to improve the slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Earth&#8208;abundant transition metal oxides show promising OER activity in alkaline media. However, most experimental information available is either from post&#8208;mortem studies or in&#8208;situ space&#8208;averaged X&#8208;ray techniques in the micrometer range. Therefore, the composition of the active centers under operando conditions is still under debate. In this work, we combine nanoscopic and spectroscopic measurements on the hydroxylation of molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)&#8208;prepared Ni and NiFe oxides nanoislands with operando local investigations of Ni and NiFe hydroxide electrocatalysts under OER conditions to reveal the nature of the active centers in 2D OER catalysts. Our results reveal that Fe doping increases the active surface area by island fragmentation, and boosts the intrinsic activity by creating optimized active centers consisting of both Ni and Fe atoms. In addition, our findings show that operando characterization at the nanoscale is crucial to reveal the dynamic nature of the interface of 2D catalysts under reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Aqueous Electrolyte Induced Formation of Water&#8208;Poor Zn2+ Solvation Structures and Gradient Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase for Long&#8208;Life Zn&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrolyte engineering has emerged as an effective strategy for stabilizing Zn&#8208;metal anodes.&#160;However, a single solute or solvent additive is far from sufficient to meet the requirements for electrolyte cycling stability. Here, we report a new&#8208;type high&#8208;entropy electrolyte composed of equal molar amounts of Zn(OTf)2 and LiOTf, along with equal volumes of H2O, triethyl phosphate, and dimethyl sulfoxide, which enhances electrolyte stability by increasing solvation entropy.&#160;Specifically, this well&#8208;designed high&#8208;entropy electrolyte reduces the content of solvated and free water molecules while forming a robust gradient solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase on the Zn anode surface, protecting the Zn anode from water&#8208;induced corrosion.  Moreover, the cationic electrostatic shielding layer on the Zn anode effectively suppresses the &#8220;tip effect&#8221;, enabling the uniform deposition of Zn. The synergistic effects of this mixed electrolyte effectively leverage the properties of individual additives, significantly extending the cycle life of Zn&#8208;metal anodes.&#160; Consequently, t he resulting Zn//Zn symmetric cell using this high&#8208;entropy electrolyte can operate over 8000 h at 1 mA cm&#8208;2 and 0.5 mAh cm&#8208;2. To highlight, in a Zn//V2O5&#183;H2O pouch cell, it retains 83.1% of initial capacity after 420 cycles at 1 A g&#8208;1. Such multifunctional high&#8208;entropy electrolyte design provides a meaningful reference for stable Zn&#8208;metal anodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Switching CO2 Electroreduction toward C2+ Products and CH4 by Regulate the Protonation and Dimerization in Platinum/Copper Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper (Cu)&#8208;based catalysts exhibit distinctive performance in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) with complex mechanism and sophisticated types of products. The management of key intermediates *CO and *H is a necessary factor for achieving high product selectivity, but lack of efficient and versatile strategies. Herein, we designed Pt modified Cu catalysts to effectively modulate the competitive coverage of those intermediates. The Pt single&#8208;atoms and Pt nanoparticles modified Cu catalysts (denoted as Cu&#8208;Pt1 and Cu&#8208;PtNPs) precisely regulated the protonation and dimerization, with the faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ products up to 70.4% and the FE of CH4 reaching 57.7%, respectively. CO stripping experiments reveal that Pt1 sites could enhance the adsorption of *CO, while PtNPs exhibit *CO tolerance for H2O dissociation. In situ spectroscopic results further confirms that high coverage of *CO is achieved on Cu&#8208;Pt1, while *CHO on Cu&#8208;PtNPs might generate by additional water dissociation. As elucidated by theoretical studies, the interfacial sites of Cu&#8208;Pt1 would favor the *CO coverage promoting the evolution of *OCCO for C2+ products while PtNPs supplementarily accelerate H2O dissociation achieving *CHO for CH4. This work provides insights for efficient and targeted CO2 conversion by atomically design of active sites with engineered key intermediates coverage.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrafast Synthesis of Nanoscale Metal Borides for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Borides based on alkaline earth to rare&#8208;earth metals can be synthesized using the flash Joule heating technique within 60&#8197;seconds. The ultrafast synthesis methods confer exceptional physicochemical properties upon these materials, thereby enabling diverse application potentials across various fields.







Abstract
Nanoscale metal borides, with exceptional physicochemical properties, have been attracted widespread attention. However, traditional synthesis methods of metal borides often lead to surface coking and large particle sizes. Herein, we have employed a flash Joule heating (FJH) technique to enable the ultrafast synthesis of metal boride nanomaterials. The synthesized materials encompass a wide range of diverse categories, including alkaline&#8208;earth metal borides (CaB6), transition metal borides (TiB2, VB2, CrB2, MoB, MoB2, MnB2, MnB4, FeB, CoB, NiB), noble&#8208;metal borides (RuB2, RuB1.1), and rare&#8208;earth metal borides (LaB6, CeB6). As an example, the RuB2 demonstrates highly desirable electrocatalytic performance for all&#8208;pH hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Especially, under the acidic condition, it exhibits an overpotential as low as 15&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8197;cm&#8722;2, with a nearly 100&#8201;% faradic efficiency. Additionally, in&#8197;situ Raman spectra confirm that both Ru and B sites serve as active sites for the HER. Moreover, the stability of RuB2 can be further enhanced by optimizing the microenvironments of the anolyte composition (H+, K+). More importantly, the experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the co&#8208;existence of H+ and K+ localized around the RuB2 plays a crucial role in further enhancing the stability.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalysed Electrochemical CO2 Methanation via the Alloying of Single Cobalt Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a single&#8208;atom cobalt doped copper catalyst (Co1Cu) that achieved a methane (CH4) Faradaic efficiency exceeding 60&#8201;% with a partial current density of &#8722;482.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In situ spectroscopic experiments and density functional theory simulations demonstrated that the modulation of the *CO adsorption configuration, with stronger bridge&#8208;binding, favours deep reduction to CH4 over the C&#8722;C coupling or CO desorption pathways.







Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to methane (CH4) presents a promising solution for mitigating CO2 emissions while producing valuable chemical feedstocks. Although single&#8208;atom catalysts have shown potential in selectively converting CO2 to CH4, their limited active sites often hinder the realization of high current densities, posing a selectivity&#8208;activity dilemma. In this study, we developed a single&#8208;atom cobalt (Co) doped copper catalyst (Co1Cu) that achieved a CH4 Faradaic efficiency exceeding 60&#8201;% with a partial current density of &#8722;482.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the incorporation of single Co atoms enhances the activation and dissociation of H2O molecules, thereby lowering the energy barrier for the hydrogenation of *CO intermediates. In situ spectroscopic experiments and density functional theory simulations further demonstrated that the modulation of the *CO adsorption configuration, with stronger bridge&#8208;binding, favours deep reduction to CH4 over the C&#8722;C coupling or CO desorption pathways. Our findings underscore the potential of Co1Cu catalysts in overcoming the selectivity&#8208;activity trade&#8208;off, paving the way for efficient and scalable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion technologies.

Mechanistic investigations revealed that the incorporation of single Co atoms enhances the activation and dissociation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules, thereby lowering the energy barrier for the hydrogenation of *CO intermediates. In situ spectroscopic experiments and density functional theory simulations further demonstrated that the modulation of the *CO adsorption configuration, with stronger bridge-binding, favours deep reduction to CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; over the C&#8722;C coupling or CO desorption pathways. Our findings underscore the potential of Co&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Cu catalysts in overcoming the selectivity-activity trade-off, paving the way for efficient and scalable CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; conversion technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Establishing the Link Between Oxygen Vacancy and Activity Enhancement in Acidic Water Oxidation of Trigonal Iridium Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Re0.03Ir0.97O2 electrocatalyst, synthesized via the molten&#8208;alkali method, leverages high&#8208;valence ion doping to create abundant oxygen vacancies. These vacancies enhance acidic OER performance by reducing OH intermediate adsorption energy and lowering the rate&#8208;determining step barrier in the AEM pathway.







Abstract
Developing durable IrO2&#8208;based electrocatalysts with high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity under acidic condition is crucial for proton exchange membrane electrolyzers. While oxygen defects are considered potentially important in OER, their direct relationship with catalytic activity has yet to be established. In this study, we introduced abundant oxygen vacancies through Re doping in 2D IrO2 (Re0.03Ir0.97O2), demonstrating their decisive role in enhancing OER performance. The Re0.03Ir0.97O2 catalyst exhibited excellent OER performance with an overpotential of 193&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and sustained activity for over 650&#8197;hours, significantly surpassing the undoped catalyst. Moreover, it maintained operation at a cell voltage of 1.70&#8197;V (~1200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) for over 140&#8197;hours without significant performance degradation. Theoretical calculations coupled with cyclic voltammetry, transient potential scanning and in&#8197;situ characterizations confirmed the adsorbate evolving mechanism on Re0.03Ir0.97O2, as well as the critical role of Re&#8208;induced oxygen vacancies in enhancing OER performance. These findings highlight that oxygen defects directly influence OER activity, providing guidance for the application of oxygen vacancy engineering in electrocatalyst design.

         <title>Building Three&#8208;Dimensional Complexity by Intramolecular 2&#8208;Aminoallyl Cation&#8722;Diene (4+3) Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular [4&#960;+2&#960;] cycloaddition of 2&#8208;aminoallyl cations with 1,3&#8208;dienes was achieved. This transformation utilized various 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;tethered ethynyl methylene cyclic carbamates (1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;EMCCs) as substrates, providing rapid access to diverse seven&#8208;membered 3D frameworks. By employing this cycloaddition as a key step, the total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;aphanamol I and (&#177;)&#8208;mint ketone was demonstrated.







Abstract
Reliable methods for rapidly constructing C(sp3)&#8208;rich three&#8208;dimensional polycycles are in high demand for organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry. Although there are various mature systems for synthesizing five&#8208; or six&#8208;membered polycycles, a catalytic platform for accessing diverse cycloheptanoid&#8208;containing polycyclic scaffolds is lacking. Herein, we describe a method for copper&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular 2&#8208;aminoallyl cation&#8722;diene (4+3) cycloaddition reactions. By using 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;tethered ethynyl methylene cyclic carbamates as substrates, we were able to construct various cycloheptanoid&#8208;containing polycyclic scaffolds, which are present in many bioactive molecules. The cycloaddition products were rich in functionality that could undergo various chemical transformations. The synthetic utility of the method was illustrated by total synthesis of the natural products (&#177;)&#8208;mint ketone and (&#177;)&#8208;aphanamol I. Mechanistic studies indicated that the cycloadditions proceed by a concerted [4&#960;+2&#960;] mechanism and that an endo&#8208;selective pathway is favored.

         <title>Two&#8208;Level Spatially Localized Proximity Labeling for Cross&#8208;Biological&#8208;Hierarchy Measurement and Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a &#8220;two&#8208;level spatially localized proximity labeling (P2L)&#8221; platform by cascading galactose oxidase (GAO)&#8208;based oxidation reaction and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)&#8208;based proximity labeling (PL). P2L integrates enzymatic logic computation and PL, enabling rapid output of spatial localization information across biological hierarchies as covalent tags for cell&#8208;selective assembly programming and microenvironmental proteomic analysis.







Abstract
Proximity labeling (PL) has emerged as a powerful technique for the in situ elucidation of biomolecular interaction networks. However, PL methods generally rely on single&#8208;biological&#8208;hierarchy control of spatial localization at the labeling site, which limits their application in multi&#8208;tiered biological systems. Here, we introduced another enzymatic reaction upstream of an enzyme&#8208;based PL reaction and targeted the two enzymes to markers indicating different biological hierarchies, establishing a two&#8208;level spatially localized proximity labeling (P2L) platform for in situ molecular measurement and manipulation. Using the cellular&#8208; and glycan&#8208;level as the hierarchical models, we demonstrated the ability of P2L to efficiently execute a two&#8208;step logic operation and to discriminate target cells with different levels of glycosylation within mixed cell populations. By mounting clickable handles via P2L, we reprogrammed the robust covalent assembly of cells at designated sites. The combination of P2L with proteomics led to the profiling of the protein microenvironment of specific glycans on target cells, revealing changes in tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;surface interactions under immune pressure from a glycan perspective. P2L provides not only a solution for revealing the heterogeneity of biological systems, but also new insights in the fields of intelligent logic computation, enzyme engineering, tissue engineering, etc.

         <title>Saturated F2&#8208;Rings from Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating fluorine into aliphatic rings induces significant changes in molecular conformation, acidity/basicity, and lipophilicity. A general method has been developed to transform exocyclic alkenes into saturated F2&#8208;rings. This reaction utilizes the reagent C6F5I(OAc)2, enabling the straightforward synthesis of gem&#8208;difluorinated macrocyclic, fused, spiro, bridged, and natural product&#8208;derived structures. The practicality of this protocol is demonstrated through several decagram&#8208;scale syntheses.

The resulting Methanosarcina barkeri (M. b)&#8208;EGaIn nanobiohybrids enabled high&#8208;performance solar&#8208;driven methanogenesis by enhancing proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer involving hydrogen atoms. This study paves the way for sustainable and scalable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;biofuel conversion under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Nanobiohybrids for solar&#8208;driven methanogenesis present a promising solution to the global energy crisis. However, conventional semiconductor&#8208;based nanobiohybrids face challenges such as limited tunability and poor biocompatibility, leading to undesirable spontaneous electron and proton transfer that compromise their structural stability and CH4 selectivity. Herein, we introduced eutectic gallium&#8211;indium alloys (EGaIn), featuring a self&#8208;limiting surface oxide layer surrounding the liquid metal core after sonication, integrated with Methanosarcina barkeri (M. b). The well&#8208;designed M. b&#8211;EGaIn nanobiohybrids exhibited superior performance, achieving a maximum CH4 yield of 455.64&#177;15.99&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1, long&#8208;term stability across four successive 7&#8208;day cycles, and remarkable CH4 selectivity of &gt;99&#8201;%. These improvements stem from enhanced proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer involving hydrogen atoms at the core&#8211;shell interface, further facilitated by the elevated expression of hydrogenases at the abiotic&#8211;biotic interface. This study provides an insightful concept for nanobiohybrid design through multi&#8208;interface engineering, advancing sustainable and scalable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;biofuel conversion under ambient conditions.

         <title>Developing Orthogonal Fluorescent RNAs for Photoactive Dual&#8208;Color Imaging of RNAs in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fluorescent RNA, mSquash/DFHBFPD, was developed using a SELEX&#8208;independent approach, enabling orthogonal RNA imaging alongside Broccoli/DFHBI&#8208;1T in live cells. Building on this, we engineered photoactivatable fluorescent RNAs with wavelength&#8208;specific activation, offering precise spatiotemporal control and advancing dual&#8208;color RNA imaging in live cells.







Abstract
Fluorogenic RNA aptamers have revolutionized the visualization of RNAs within complex cellular processes. A representative category of them employs the derivatives of green fluorescent protein chromophore, 4&#8208;hydroxybenzlidene imidazolinone (HBI), as chromophores. However, the structural homogeneity of their chromophoric backbones causes severe cross&#8208;reactivity with other homologous chromophores. This limitation impairs their multiplexing capabilities, which are essential for the simultaneous visualization of multiple RNA species in live cells. Herein, we rationally designed a series of red&#8208;shifted chromophores and employed SELEX&#8208;independent engineering to develop a novel fluorogenic RNA aptamer, mSquash. mSquash displays specific and intense fluorescence upon binding with our red&#8208;shifted chromophore DFHBFPD (Ex/Em=501/624&#8197;nm). The mSquash/DFHBFPD allows orthogonal imaging of selected RNA targets alongside the established Broccoli/DFHBI&#8208;1T (Ex/Em=472/501&#8197;nm), facilitating multiplexed live cell imaging of various targets. Moreover, we expanded the application of fluorescent RNA to photoactive imaging by constructing two genetically encoded photoactivatable fluorescent RNAs for the first time. This innovative approach allows photoactivatable control of fluorescent RNAs via specific light wavelengths (365&#8197;nm and 450&#8197;nm), enabling spatiotemporal dual&#8208;color imaging of RNAs in live cells. Our findings represent a significant advancement in fluorescent RNA&#8208;based orthogonal imaging and spatiotemporal analysis of RNAs.

         <title>Ring&#8208;in&#8208;Ring Assembly Facilitates the Synthesis of a [12]Cycloparaphenylene ABC&#8208;Type [3]Catenane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By threading a secondary ammonium salt through the crown ether and closing the third ring via CuAAC click reaction, we obtained a rare ABC&#8208;type hetero&#8208;[3]catenane comprising [12]CPP, 24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 and a dibenzylammonium macrocycle. X&#8208;ray crystallography shed light on the ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring pre&#8208;organization. Molecular simulations provided insights into the intriguing ring&#8208;vs.&#8208;ring&#8208;vs.&#8208;ring dynamics of the [3]catenane.







Abstract
Cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) represent a significant challenge for the synthesis of mechanically interlocked architectures, because they lack heteroatoms, which precludes traditional active and passive template methods. To circumvent this problem and explore the fundamental and functional properties of CPP rotaxanes and catenanes, researchers have resorted to unusual non&#8208;covalent and even to labor&#8208;intensive covalent template approaches. Herein, we report a ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring non&#8208;covalent template strategy that makes use of the surprisingly strong non&#8208;covalent inclusion of crown ethers into suitably sized CPPs. By threading a secondary ammonium salt through the crown ether and closing the third ring via CuAAC click reaction, we obtained a rare ABC&#8208;type hetero&#8208;[3]catenane comprising [12]CPP, 24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 and a dibenzylammonium macrocycle. X&#8208;ray crystallography shed light on the ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring pre&#8208;organization and the [3]catenane topology was confirmed by NMR and MS&#8208;MS studies. Molecular simulations provided insights into the intriguing ring&#8208;vs.&#8208;ring&#8208;vs.&#8208;ring dynamics of the [3]catenane, which are highly dependent on the protonation state of the dibenzylammonium site. This ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring assembly strategy opens new avenues for the synthesis of complex CPP architectures and their use in functional supramolecular systems.

         <title>Light&#8208;induced Enhancement of Energetic Charge Carrier Extraction and Modulation of Local Charge Density to Impact Selectivity in Plasmonic Nanometals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, silver nanometals modified with various sulfhydryl ligands (re&#8208;Ag&#8208;S&#8208;R) were synthesized via photoreduction. The modified surface effectively extracts and stabilizes excited&#8208;state electrons from plasmonic nanometals. By employing substituents with distinct electron donor/acceptor properties, the surface charge density was systematically tuned, thereby influencing the selectivity between CO2 reduction and H2 evolution.







Abstract
Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) metals exhibit remarkable light&#8208;absorbing property and unique catalytic activity, attracting significant attention in photocatalysts recently. However, the practical application of plasmonic nanometal is hindered by challenge of energetic electrons extraction and low selectivity. The energetic carriers generated in nanometal under illumination have extremely short lifetimes, leading to rapid energy loss. In this work, silver nanometals modified with five distinct sulfhydryl ligands (re&#8208;Ag&#8208;S&#8208;R) were synthesized via photoreduction of superlattice precursors. Modified surface efficiently extracts and preserves excited state electrons of plasmonic nanometals. By modulation the local charge density at catalytic active sites through substituents with varying electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing properties, the selectivity of the photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction was influenced. The results demonstrated opposite selectivity between methoxy&#8208;modified re&#8208;Ag&#8208;S&#8208;OCH3 (CO selectivity of 96.73&#8201;%) and amino&#8208;modified re&#8208;Ag&#8208;S&#8208;NH2 (H2 selectivity of 96.66&#8201;%) despite their similar structures. The changes in excited states and surface contact potentials induced by LSPR were monitored using femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) spectroscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). Meanwhile, the detailed discussion of the LSPR mechanism in plasmonic nanometals will serve as valuable references and foundational elements for future research in this area.

         <title>Integrating Enzymes with Reticular Frameworks To Govern Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarizes recent advances in the development of hybrid biocatalysts by integrating enzymes with reticular frameworks, with specific emphasis on how framework architecture and host&#8208;guest interactions influence bioreactivity. Three key regulatory mechanisms are highlighted: 1) guiding mass transfer through pore structures, 2) regulating enzyme conformation via interfacial interactions, and 3) enabling photoactivated biocatalysis by leveraging photoactive reticular frameworks.







Abstract
Integrating enzymes with reticular frameworks offers promising avenues for access to functionally tailorable biocatalysis. This Minireview explores recent advances in enzyme&#8208;reticular framework hybrid biocomposites, focusing on the utilization of porous reticular frameworks, including metal&#8208;organic frameworks, covalent&#8208;organic frameworks, and hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks, to regulate the reactivity of an enzyme encapsulated inside mainly by pore infiltration and in situ encapsulation strategies. We highlight how pore engineering and host&#8208;guest interfacial interactions within reticular frameworks create tailored microenvironments that substantially impact the mass transfer and enzyme conformation, leading to biocatalytic rate enhancement, or imparting enzymes with non&#8208;native biocatalytic functions, including substrate selectivity and new activity. Additionally, the feasibility of leveraging the photothermal effect of a framework to optimize the local reaction temperature and photoelectric effect to elicit diverse photoenzyme&#8208;coupled reactions is also summarized in detail, which can expand the functional repertoire of biocatalytic transformations under light irradiation. This Minireview underscores the potential of reticular frameworks as tunable and reliable platforms to govern biocatalysis, offering pathways for engineering sustainable, efficient, and selective biocatalytic reactors in pharmaceutical, environmental, and energy&#8208;related applications.

Three key regulatory mechanisms are highlighted: 1) guiding mass transfer through pore structures, 2) regulating enzyme conformation via interfacial interactions, and 3) enabling photoactivated biocatalysis by leveraging photoactive reticular frameworks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrating enzymes with reticular frameworks offers promising avenues for access to functionally tailorable biocatalysis. This Minireview explores recent advances in enzyme-reticular framework hybrid biocomposites, focusing on the utilization of porous reticular frameworks, including metal-organic frameworks, covalent-organic frameworks, and hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks, to regulate the reactivity of an enzyme encapsulated inside mainly by pore infiltration and in situ encapsulation strategies. We highlight how pore engineering and host-guest interfacial interactions within reticular frameworks create tailored microenvironments that substantially impact the mass transfer and enzyme conformation, leading to biocatalytic rate enhancement, or imparting enzymes with non-native biocatalytic functions, including substrate selectivity and new activity. Additionally, the feasibility of leveraging the photothermal effect of a framework to optimize the local reaction temperature and photoelectric effect to elicit diverse photoenzyme-coupled reactions is also summarized in detail, which can expand the functional repertoire of biocatalytic transformations under light irradiation. This Minireview underscores the potential of reticular frameworks as tunable and reliable platforms to govern biocatalysis, offering pathways for engineering sustainable, efficient, and selective biocatalytic reactors in pharmaceutical, environmental, and energy-related applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Robust Mechanically Interlocked Network Ionogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ionogels have attracted considerable attention as versatile materials due to their unique ionic conductivity and thermal stability. However, relatively weak mechanical performance of many existing ionogels has hindered their broader application. Herein, we develop robust, tough, and impact&#8208;resistant mechanically interlocked network ionogels (IGMINs) by incorporating ion liquids with mechanical bonds that can dissipate energy while maintain structural stability. Profiting from the dynamic yet stable nature of the mechanically interlocked networks, IGMINs exhibit high tensile strength (9.6 MPa), fracture energy (39 kJ/m2), and toughness (25.9 MJ/m3), along with a high elongation rate (473%) and excellent impact resistance and shape memory, resulting in overall performance that surpasses most reported ionogels. Furthermore, in the application of strain sensors for monitoring the gait of crawling robots, the toughness and robustness of IGMINs ensure their ability to consistently output stable electrical signals during the stretching and contraction processes, thereby highlighting their practical application potential. Our work provides a new research strategy for toughening ionogels and promotes the development of mechanically interlocked materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Amorphization Stabilizes Te&#8208;Based Aqueous Batteries via Confining Free Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trapped with the sluggish reduction kinetics, the easy dissolution of Te4+ species, and a controversial energy storage mechanism, achieving complete and stable hypervalent Te0/Te4+ electrochemistry in an aqueous environment is challenging. Herein, an amorphization strategy is introduced to stabilize aqueous TeO2/Te electrochemistry via confining free water, triggering impressive Te redox utilization, high&#8208;rate performance, and long&#8208;term cycling stability.







Abstract
Tellurium (Te), with its rich valence states (&#8722;2 to +6), could endow aqueous batteries with potentially high specific capacity. However, achieving complete and stable hypervalent Te0/Te4+ electrochemistry in an aqueous environment poses significant challenges, owing to the sluggish reduction kinetics, easy dissolution of Te4+ species, and a controversial energy storage mechanism. Herein, we demonstrate a crystallographic regulation strategy for robust aqueous Te redox electrochemistry. With strong hydrogen bonding, NH4Ac confines free water, prompting the amorphization of TeO2 (a&#8208;TeO2). In&#8197;situ synchrotron characterization, spectroscopy analysis, electrochemical evaluation, and theoretical calculations reveal a specific 4&#8201;e&#8722; solid&#8208;solid transition pathway (Te to a&#8208;TeO2) with accelerated diffusion and charge transfer kinetics, attributed to a closer unoccupied electron orbital to the Fermi level and a reduced water desorption energy barrier in a&#8208;TeO2. Impressively, the a&#8208;TeO2/Te redox exhibits a high reversible capacity of 834&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (99% of Te redox utilization), superior rate performance (644&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and an ultralong lifespan (over 3000 cycles). These findings prove a new tactic to advance aqueous Te redox electrochemistry toward high&#8208;energy aqueous batteries.

         <title>Forward&#8210; and Retro&#8210;Vapofluorochromism of Sponge&#8210;Like Macrocycle Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving dynamic multicolor emission through solid&#8208;state molecular motion is of significant importance for advancing applications in organic solid&#8208;state luminescent materials. Herein, we report macrocycle crystals with unique forward&#8210; and retro&#8210;vapofluorochromic behavior, which is realized by reversible amine vapor uptake and amine&#8210;&#8220;squeeze&#8221; induced guest release. The forward&#8210;vapofluorochromism occurs when aliphatic amines penetrate guest&#8208;free macrocycle crystals to form host&#8210;guest complex crystals. These fluorescent properties can be reversibly toggled by exposing the amine&#8210;loaded crystals to another amine vapor through competitive guest replacement inside the crystals. Notably, retro&#8210;vapofluorochromism is achieved by exposing amine&#8210;loaded crystals to &#945;&#8210;methylbenzylamine (MBA). Mechanistic studies show that MBA molecules do not penetrate the crystal, but rather &#8220;squeeze&#8221; the crystals to release loaded amines, driving the amine&#8210;loaded crystals back to the guest&#8208;free phase. The demonstrated forward&#8210; and retro&#8210;vapofluorochromism has already been successfully integrated into a highly secure five&#8210;layer information encryption system.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic, Single&#8208;cell Monitoring of RNA Modifications Response to Viral Infection Using a Genetically Encoded Live&#8208;cell RNA Methylation Sensor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>RNA modifications, such as N6&#8208;methylation of adenosine (m6A), serve as key regulators of cellular behaviors, and are highly dynamic; however, tools for dynamic monitoring of RNA modifications in live cells are lacking. Here, we develop a genetically encoded live&#8208;cell RNA methylation sensor that can dynamically monitor RNA m6A level at single&#8208;cell resolution. The sensor senses RNA m6A in cells via affinity&#8208;induced cytoplasmic retention using a nuclear location sequence&#8208;fused m6A reader. It allows for simultaneously measure RNA m6A dynamics and viral invasion at single&#8208;cell level. Based on the single&#8208;cell analytical tool, we found that SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection enhances host&#8208;cell RNA m6A level, and high&#8208;level RNA m6A modification in host cells, in turn, facilitates viral infection. Particularly, Omicron, a variant of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, that features as high infection capacity, however, exhibits a reduced facilitation of m6A modification in host cells. In addition, the sensor can estimate viral inhibition via measuring cellular m6A level, that was explored for screening potential antiviral drugs. The methylation sensor can serve for elucidating the interplay between pathogens and host&#8208;cell epigenetics at single&#8208;cell level.</dc:description>

         <title>Valence State Hydrogen Channel Enhances Sustained and Controllable Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution in Diabetic Skin Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diabetes significantly increases the risk of serious health issues, including prolonged skin inflammation and delayed wound healing, owing to inferior glucose control and suppression of the immune system. Although traditional hydrogen (H2) therapy is slightly effective, its ability to tailor the release of H2 on the skin is limited. Accordingly, this study proposed a novel strategy for electrocatalytic H2 release under neutral conditions to promote wound healing in diabetic mice and rabbit. Herein, a defect&#8208;engineered cobalt phosphide (CoP) catalyst was designed by introducing a neutral single&#8208;metal electrocatalytic Hydrogen valence state channel into CoP. By effectively regulating the formation and transfer of *H active species during the CoP catalytic process, a considerable enhancement in neutral electrocatalytic H2 evolution performance was achieved (&#8208;78.0 mV@&#8208;10.0 mA cm&#8208;2). Based on this superior catalytic performance, we developed a flexible electrode (namely, CoP/flexible gold electrode made by screen printing (FGSP) by combining a convenient electrolysis platform with continuous electrolyte supply and FGSP, enabling customized H2 release and accelerating wound healing in diabetic mice and rabbits. Notably, the designed flexible electrode features adjustable dimensions, interchangeable substrates, and material adaptability, meeting the diverse needs of clinical and basic research and demonstrating significant potential for applications in clinical medicine.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
Synthetic biomolecular condensates are appealing candidates to replicate key features and functions of intracellular membrane&#8208;less organelles. Their dynamic phase&#8208;separation control provides crucial insights into the regulation of fundamental cell processes. Via integration with ambitious cell&#8208;like features and behaviors, synthetic biomolecular condensates offer innovative solutions for engineering active materials with sophisticated functions.







Abstract
Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation towards the formation of synthetic coacervate droplets represents a rapidly advancing frontier in the fields of synthetic biology, material science, and biomedicine. These artificial constructures mimic the biophysical principles and dynamic features of natural biomolecular condensates that are pivotal for cellular regulation and organization. Via adapting biological concepts, synthetic condensates with dynamic phase&#8208;separation control provide crucial insights into the fundamental cell processes and regulation of complex biological pathways. They are increasingly designed with the ability to display more complex and ambitious cell&#8208;like features and behaviors, which offer innovative solutions for cytomimetic modeling and engineering active materials with sophisticated functions. In this minireview, we highlight recent advancements in the design and construction of synthetic coacervate droplets; including their biomimicry structure and organization to replicate life&#8208;like properties and behaviors, and the dynamic control towards engineering active coacervates. Moreover, we highlight the unique applications of synthetic coacervates as catalytic centers and promising delivery vehicles, so that these biomimicry assemblies can be translated into practical applications.

         <title>Unlocking HFIP for Fluoroalkylation with Molecular Photoelectrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the increasing interest in radical&#8208;based fluoroalkylation techniques, the organofluorine compounds bearing the partially fluorinated hexafluoroisopropyl group remain extremely scarce due to the lack of appropriate reagents. Herein we report an unprecedented&#160;photoelectrocatalytic method for the C&#8211;H hexafluoroisopropylation of indoles and tryptophan peptides, utilizing the readily available hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP) as the fluoroalkylation reagent. In this process, HFIP is converted into hexafluoroisopropyl radicals, enabling fluoroalkylation reactions. This study broadens the potential applications of molecular photoelectrocatalysis, highlighting its capacity to enable transformations that are difficult to accomplish through traditional electrochemical or photochemical approaches.</dc:description>

         <title>Broad&#8208;Temperature Optical Thermometry via Dual Sensitivity of Self&#8208;Trapped Excitons Lifetime and Higher&#8208;Order Phonon Anharmonicity in Lead&#8208;Free Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Broad&#8208;temperature optical thermometry necessitates materials with exceptional sensitivity and stability across varied thermal conditions, presenting challenges for conventional systems. Here, we report a lead&#8208;free, vacancy&#8208;ordered perovskite Cs2TeCl6, that achieves precise temperature sensing through a novel combination of self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) photoluminescence (PL) lifetime modulation and unprecedented fifth&#8208;order phonon anharmonicity. The STEs PL lifetime demonstrates a highly temperature&#8208;sensitive response from 200 to 300 K, ideal for low&#8208;to&#8208;intermediate thermal sensing. In contrast, the Eg phonon mode undergoes significant linewidth broadening due to five&#8208;phonon scattering processes, with a distinct nonlinear temperature dependence up to 500 K. This fifth&#8208;order anharmonic effect enhances Raman&#8208;based temperature sensitivity, yielding a specific sensitivity (Sr) of 0.577% K&#8722;1 at 330 K and remaining above 0.5% K&#8722;1 at elevated temperatures. This study presents the first evidence of fifth&#8208;order anharmonic effects enhancing Raman&#8208;based temperature sensitivity, establishing Cs2TeCl6 as a versatile candidate for broad&#8208;temperature optical thermometry and opening new avenues for precise non&#8208;contact temperature sensing in advanced technological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantifying Asymmetric Coordination to Correlate Oxygen Reduction Activity in Fe&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precisely manipulating asymmetric coordination configurations and examining electronic effects enable to tuning the intrinsic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). However, the shortage of a definite relationship between coordination asymmetry and catalytic activity makes the rational design of SACs ambiguous. Here, we propose a concept of &#8220;asymmetry degree&#8221; to quantify asymmetric coordination configurations and assess the effectiveness of active moieties in Fe&#8208;based SACs. A theoretical framework is established where elucidating the volcanic relationship between asymmetry degree and ORR activity by constructing a series of Fe&#8208;based SAC models doped with non&#8208;metal atoms (B, P, S, Se, and Te) in the first or second coordination sphere, which aligns with Sabatier principle. The predicted ORR activity of Fe asymmetric active moieties is then experimentally validated using asymmetry degree. The combined computational and experimental results suggest that single&#8208;atom moiety with a moderate asymmetry degree exhibits optimal intrinsic ORR activity, because breaking the square&#8208;planar symmetry of FeN4 can alter the electronic population of the Fe 3d&#8208;orbital, thereby optimizing the adsorption&#8208;desorption strength of intermediates and thus enhancing the intrinsic ORR activity. This fundamental understanding of catalytic activity from geometric and electronic aspects offers a rational guidance to design high&#8208;performance SACs with asymmetric configurations.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Asymmetric Solid Additive Enables Eco&#8208;friendly All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with Over 19% Efficiency and Excellent Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The optimization of morphology in all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) often relies on the use of solvent additives. However, their tendency to remain trapped in the device due to high boiling points leads to performance degradation over time. In this study, we introduce a novel approach involving the design and synthesis of one dual&#8208;asymmetric solid additive featuring mono&#8208;brominated&#8208;asymmetric dithienothiophene (SL&#8208;1). Leveraging the synergistic effects of asymmetric substitution and core structures, fine&#8208;tuning the molecule dipole moment enhancing solid additive interactions with host materials, thereby regulating polymer aggregation and influencing blend morphology during device fabrication. This results in highly ordered &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and a favorable phase&#8208;separated morphology within all&#8208;polymer active layer. Our work achieved a record efficiency of 19.19% in eco&#8208;friendly all&#8208;PSCs, significantly outperforming SL&#8208;0 (18.37%) and SL&#8208;2 (16.60%), both featuring an asymmetric core. Furthermore, SL&#8208;1&#8208;treated all&#8208;PSCs retain over 90% of their initial efficiency after 2140 hours of operation, with an extrapolated T80 lifetime reaching 12400 hours. This represents a significant improvement in stability compared to devices treated with solvent additive (1&#8208;CN), which typically exhibits a T90 lifetime of 700 hours. Our findings underscore the efficacy of utilizing dual&#8208;asymmetric solid additives as a straightforward and viable strategy for optimizing all&#8208;polymer morphology.</dc:description>

         <title>Passivating Lattice Oxygen in ZnO Nanocrystals to Reduce its Interactions with the Key Intermediates for a Selective Photocatalytic Methane Oxidation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Fe&#8208;doped ZnO hollow polyhedron has been successfully developed for selectively photocatalytic conversion of methane to methanol under mild conditions. The incorporation of Fe effectively lowered the center of the O 2p orbital, which passivated the activity of the lattice oxygen within the nanocrystals, significantly attenuating the interaction between lattice oxygen and *CH3 intermediate.







Abstract
An inevitable overoxidation process is considered as one of the most challenging problems in the direct conversion of methane (CH4) to methanol (CH3OH), which is limited by the uncontrollable cracking of key intermediates. Herein, we have successfully constructed a photocatalyst, the Fe&#8208;doped ZnO hollow polyhedron (Fe/ZnOHP), for the highly selective photoconversion of CH4 to CH3OH under mild conditions. In situ experiments and density functional theory calculations confirmed that the introduction of Fe was able to decrease the energy level of the O 2p orbital, which passivated the activity of lattice oxygen in ZnO nanocrystals. This passivation effect greatly weakened the interaction between *CH3 and lattice oxygen, thus facilitating the conversion of *CH3O to *CH3 intermediate rather than the direct desorption of *CH3O. As a result, Fe/ZnOHP exhibited excellent CH3OH generation rate (ca. 1009&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and selectivity (ca. 96&#8201;%) in the photocatalytic conversion of CH4 at room temperature and low pressure.

         <title>Leveraging Iron in the Electrolyte to Improve Oxygen Evolution Reaction Performance: Fundamentals, Strategies, and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controlled introduction of iron ions into the electrolyte, coupled with a suitable host material to facilitate in situ iron deposition, opens new strategies for creating highly efficient and dynamically stable electrochemical interfaces to continuously catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction at a steady rate, thereby breaking the trade&#8208;off between catalytic activity and material stability.







Abstract
Electrochemical water splitting is a pivotal technology for storing intermittent electricity from renewable sources into hydrogen fuel. However, its overall energy efficiency is impeded by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode. In the quest to design high&#8208;performance anode catalysts for driving the OER under non&#8208;acidic conditions, iron (Fe) has emerged as a crucial element. Although the profound impact of adventitious electrolyte Fen+ species on OER catalysis had been reported forty years ago, recent interest in tailoring the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface has spurred studies on the controlled introduction of Fe ions into the electrolyte to improve OER performance. During the catalytic process, scenarios where the rate of Fen+ deposition on a specific host material outruns that of dissolution pave the way for establishing highly efficient and dynamically stable electrochemical interfaces for long&#8208;term steady operation. This review systematically summarizes recent endeavors devoted to elucidating the behaviors of in situ Fe(aq.) incorporation, the role of incorporated Fe sites in the OER, and critical factors influencing the interplay between the electrode surface and Fe ions in the electrolyte environment. Finally, unexplored issues related to comprehensively understanding and leveraging the dynamic exchange of Fen+ at the interface for improved OER catalysis are summarized.

         <title>Observation of the Smallest Three&#8208;Dimensional Neutral Boron Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoionization efficiency spectrum of B9 was measured by using VUV free electron laser. B9 was characterized to be the smallest 3D neutral boron cluster with a heptagonal bipyramid D7h structure, quite different from the planar molecular wheel of B9&#8208;. A single&#8208;electron B&#8208;B bond between the capping atoms is found to be crucial in stabilizing the D7h structure of B9.







Abstract
Despite major progress in the investigation of boron cluster anions, direct experimental study of neutral boron clusters remains a significant challenge because of the difficulty in size selection. Here we report a size&#8208;specific study of the neutral B9 cluster using threshold photoionization with a tunable vacuum ultraviolet free electron laser. The ionization potential of B9 is measured to be 8.45&#177;0.02&#8197;eV and it is found to have a heptagonal bipyramid D7h structure, quite different from the planar molecular wheel of the B9&#8208; anionic cluster. Chemical bonding analyses reveal superior stability of the bipyramidal structure arising from delocalized &#963; and &#960; bonding interactions within the B7 ring and between the B7 ring and the capping atoms. Photoionization of B9 breaks the single&#8208;electron B&#8208;B bond of the capping atoms, which undergo off&#8208;axis distortion to enhance interactions with the B7 ring in the singlet ground state of B9+. The single&#8208;electron B&#8208;B bond of the capping atoms appears to be crucial in stabilizing the D7h structure of B9. This work opens avenues for direct size&#8208;dependent experimental studies of a large variety of neutral boron clusters to explore the stepwise development of network structures.

         <title>Kinetic Control of Self&#8208;Assembly Pathway in Dual Dynamic Covalent Polymeric Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;One monomer for two materials&#8221;: Dual dynamic covalent chemistries diversify the pathway of molecular self&#8208;assembly and produce distinct polymeric materials as a function of evaporation rate.







Abstract
Kinetically controlled self&#8208;assembly is garnering increasing interest in the field of supramolecular polymers and materials, yet examples involving dynamic covalent exchange remain relatively unexplored. Here we report an unexpected dynamic covalent polymeric system whose aqueous self&#8208;assembly pathway is strongly influenced by the kinetics of evaporation of water. The key design is to integrate dual dynamic covalent bonds&#8212;including disulfide bonds and boroxine/borate&#8212;into a dynamic equilibrium system of monomers, polymers, and materials. This dual dynamic covalent design allows polymer growth and crosslinking to occur with the same spatiotemporal characteristics, governed solely by solvent evaporation. We found that a single building block can assemble into two distinct types of polymeric materials, each characterized by unique crosslinking topologies, orders, solubility, and macroscopic properties. The dual dynamic nature of the materials imparts them with intrinsic reconfigurability, such as interfacial repairability and close&#8208;loop chemical recyclability.

         <title>Interfacial Water Orientation in Neutral Oxygen Catalysis for Reversible Ampere&#8208;Scale Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A significant breakthrough in neutral oxygen catalysis was achieved by altering the orientation of water molecules from conventional O&#8208;down to unexpected H&#8208;down in the hydrogen bond network.







Abstract
The neutral oxygen catalysis is an electrochemical reaction of the utmost importance in energy generation, storage application, and chemical synthesis. However, the restricted availability of protons poses a challenge to achieving kinetically favorable oxygen catalytic reactions. Here, we alter the interfacial water orientation by adjusting the Br&#248;nsted acidity at the catalyst surface, to break the proton transfer limitation of neutral oxygen electrocatalysis. An unexpected role of water molecules in improving the activity of neutral oxygen catalysis is revealed, namely, increasing the H&#8208;down configuration water in electric double layers rather than merely affecting the energy barriers for reaction limiting steps. The proposed porous nanofibers with atomically dispersed MnN3 exhibit record&#8208;breaking activity (EORR@1/2/EOER@10&#8197;mA = 0.85/1.65&#8201;V vs. RHE) and reversibility (2500&#8197;h), outperforming all previously reported neutral catalysts and rivaling conventional alkaline systems. In particular, practical ampere&#8208;scale zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) stack are constructed with a capacity of 5.93 Ah and can stably operate under 1.0&#8201;A and 1.0&#8201;Ah conditions, demonstrating broad application prospects. This work provides a novel and feasible perspective for designing neutral oxygen electrocatalysts and reveals the future commercial potential in mobile power supply and large&#8208;scale energy storage.

         <title>Defluorinative C&#8722;O Coupling between Trifluoromethylarenes and Alcohols via Copper Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CF2O&#8208;compounds are prepared via photoinduced, Cu&#8208;catalyzed defluorinative coupling between readily available trifluoromethylarenes and alcohols. A molecule displaying liquid crystal property was synthesized through this convergent and step&#8208;economical method. Mechanistic studies suggested that a homoleptic Cu&#8208;bisphosphine complex serves as the photocatalyst, and the two salt additives are crucial in orchestrating this dual&#8208;cycle system.







Abstract
Fluorine&#8208;containing compounds have shown unparalleled impacts in the realm of functional molecules, and the ability to prepare novel structures has been crucial in unlocking new properties for applications in pharmaceutical and materials science. Herein, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed, photoinduced defluorinative C&#8722;O coupling between trifluoromethylarenes and alcohols. This method allows for direct access to a wide selection of difluorobenzylether (ArCF2OR) molecules, including a compound displaying liquid crystal behavior. Through slight modification of the protocol, we were able to generate difluorobenzyliodide (ArCF2I) products, another class of synthetically useful fluorine&#8208;bearing molecules. Mechanistic investigations first suggested that ArCF2I can serve as a reservoir to steadily supply the key ArCF2&#8901; radical species. Furthermore, experimental evidence supported a mechanism consisting of two collaborative cycles: C&#8722;F activation operated by a homoleptic Cu(I) coordinated by two bisphosphine ligands as the photocatalyst and C&#8722;O coupling promoted by a Cu(I) ligated by a single bisphosphine ligand. The critical roles of the two salt additives, lithium iodide and zinc acetate, in orchestrating the two cycles were also elucidated.

&lt;p&gt;CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O-compounds are prepared via photoinduced, Cu-catalyzed defluorinative coupling between readily available trifluoromethylarenes and alcohols. A molecule displaying liquid crystal property was synthesized through this convergent and step-economical method. Mechanistic studies suggested that a homoleptic Cu-bisphosphine complex serves as the photocatalyst, and the two salt additives are crucial in orchestrating this dual-cycle system.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluorine-containing compounds have shown unparalleled impacts in the realm of functional molecules, and the ability to prepare novel structures has been crucial in unlocking new properties for applications in pharmaceutical and materials science. Herein, we report a copper-catalyzed, photoinduced defluorinative C&#8722;O coupling between trifluoromethylarenes and alcohols. This method allows for direct access to a wide selection of difluorobenzylether (ArCF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OR) molecules, including a compound displaying liquid crystal behavior. Through slight modification of the protocol, we were able to generate difluorobenzyliodide (ArCF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I) products, another class of synthetically useful fluorine-bearing molecules. Mechanistic investigations first suggested that ArCF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I can serve as a reservoir to steadily supply the key ArCF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901; radical species. Furthermore, experimental evidence supported a mechanism consisting of two collaborative cycles: C&#8722;F activation operated by a homoleptic Cu(I) coordinated by two bisphosphine ligands as the photocatalyst and C&#8722;O coupling promoted by a Cu(I) ligated by a single bisphosphine ligand. The critical roles of the two salt additives, lithium iodide and zinc acetate, in orchestrating the two cycles were also elucidated. This dual-role copper catalyst demonstrates the power of base metal photoredox catalysis in achieving both substrate activation and chemical bond formation via a single catalytic system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Proximal Oblique&#8208;Packing of Heptamethine Cyanines through Spiro&#8208;Connection Boosts Triplet State Generation in Near&#8208;Infrared</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proximal oblique&#8208;packed (V&#8208;shaped packing) of heptamethine cyanine dimer can induce multi&#8208;channel ultrafast triplet state generation with the rate constants up to ~1011&#8197;s&#8722;1, leading a triplet state quantum yield of 18.9&#8201;% upon excitation at 750&#8197;nm, which is almost an order of magnitude higher than that of the monomer (IR780, 2.1&#8201;%).







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) triplet dyes are the cornerstones of cutting&#8208;edge biomedical and material applications. The difficulty in rational development of triplet dyes increases exponentially as the absorption wavelength shifts deeper into the NIR range. Although classical H&#8208;/J&#8208;typed packing of NIR dyes has the potential to enhance intersystem crossing (ISC) compared with that in single&#8208;chromophore dyes, the triplet state quantum yields remain limited in such strategy. Herein, proximal oblique&#8208;packed (V&#8208;shaped) heptamethine cyanines (SZ780) through spiro&#8208;connection were achieved. Multi&#8208;channel ultrafast ISC were direct observed in SZ780 and a record high ISC rate constant (up to ~1011&#8197;s&#8722;1) is registered among all the reported NIR triplet dyes. SZ780 exhibits a triplet state quantum yield of 18.9&#8201;% upon excitation at 750&#8197;nm, which is almost an order of magnitude higher than that of the monomer (IR780, 2.1&#8201;%) and nearly threefold increase compared to that of the H&#8208;packed dimer (SC780) (6.7&#8201;%). Moreover, SZ780 efficiently generates singlet oxygen under 808&#8197;nm light irradiation, inducing cancer cell apoptosis in vivo. These findings demonstrate that constructing V&#8208;aggregated dyes system by spiro&#8208;connection offers a powerful approach for the design of high&#8208;performance NIR triplet sensitizers.

         <title>A Small&#8208;Molecule Drug for the Self&#8208;Checking of Mitophagy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a innovative &#8220;one&#8208;two punch&#8221; drug design strategy, exemplified by the mitophagy self&#8208;check drug. This strategy integrates both target&#8208;zone drug functionality and non&#8208;target zone biological reporting into a single small&#8208;molecule drug, effectively addressing the challenges associated with conventional marker interference in drug evaluation.







Abstract
Mitophagy, particularly in the context of drugs that disrupt mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), represents a critical focus in pharmacology. However, the discovery and evaluation of MMP&#8208;disrupting drugs are often hampered using commercially available marker molecules that target similar or identical zones. These markers can significantly interfere with, obscure, or amplify the functional effects of MMP&#8208;targeting drugs, frequently leading to clinical failures. In response to this challenge, we propose a &#8220;one&#8208;two punch&#8221; drug design strategy that integrates both target&#8208;zone drug functionality and non&#8208;target zone biological reporting within a single small&#8208;molecule drug. We have developed a novel proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept mitophagy self&#8208;check drug (MitoSC) that exhibits dual&#8208;color and dual&#8208;localization properties. The functional component of this system is a variable MitoSC that disrupts mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) homeostasis, thereby inducing mitophagy. Upon activation, this component transforms into a blue&#8208;fluorescent monomer (MitoSC&#8208;fun) specifically within the mitochondrial target zone. Concurrently, the biological reporting component is represented by a red&#8208;fluorescent monomer (MitoSC&#8208;rep) that localizes to lysosomes, the non&#8208;target zone. As mitophagy progresses, the fluorescent signals from MitoSC&#8208;rep (lysosomes) and MitoSC&#8208;fun (mitochondria) converge, enabling real&#8208;time monitoring of the mitophagic process. This strategy combines potent drug functionality with robust biological reporting, thereby minimizing interference and eliminating the complexities associated with external detection. Our findings underscore the potential of a single&#8208;molecule drug to exert target&#8208;zone specific actions while simultaneously providing non&#8208;target zone self&#8208;checking, offering a new perspective for drug design.

         <title>A Two&#8208;in&#8208;One Strategy to Simultaneously Boost the Site Density and Turnover Frequency of Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C Oxygen Reduction Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Treating a Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst with NH4I vapor via a one&#8208;step chemical vapor deposition process leads to the simultaneous improvements in the turnover frequency via the I&#8208;doping induced electronic structure tuning and site density via the etching of carbon substrate by the in&#8197;situ generated NH3, resulting in superior oxygen reduction activity in both acidic and alkaline media.







Abstract
Site density (SD) and turnover frequency (TOF) are the two fundamental kinetic descriptors that determine the oxygen reduction activity of iron&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C) catalysts that represent the most promising alternatives to precious and scarce platinum. However, it remains a grand challenge to simultaneously optimize these two parameters in a single Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst. Here we show that treating a typical Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst with ammonium iodine (NH4I) vapor via a one&#8208;step chemical vapor deposition process not only increases the surface area and porosity of the catalyst (and thus enhanced exposure of active sites) via the etching effect of the in&#8197;situ released NH3, but also regulates the electronic structure of the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C moieties by the iodine dopants incorporated into the carbon matrix. As a result, the NH4I&#8208;treated Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst possesses both high values in the SD of 2.15&#215;1019 sites g&#8722;1 (&#215;2 enhancement compared to the untreated counterpart) and TOF of 3.71 electrons site&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 (&#215;3 enhancement) that correspond to a high mass activity of 12.78 A g&#8722;1, as determined by in&#8197;situ nitrite stripping technique. Moreover, this catalyst exhibits an excellent oxygen reduction activity in base with a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.924&#8201;V and acceptable activity in acid with E1/2 =0.795&#8201;V, and superior power density of 249.1&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a zinc&#8208;air battery.

         <title>B,N&#8208;Embedded Helical Nanographenes Showing an Ion&#8208;Triggered Chiroptical Switching Function</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eight phenyl groups were fused into carbazole to give a novel &#960;&#8208;extended azahelicene. Boron incorporation furnished a B,N&#8208;embedded helical nanographene showing an ion&#8208;triggered chiroptical switch between the three&#8208;coordinate boron and four&#8208;coordinate boron species with the change in the color and glum values.







Abstract
Intramolecular oxidative aromatic coupling of 3,6&#8208;bis(m&#8208;terphenyl&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;yl)carbazole provided a bis(m&#8208;terphenyl)&#8208;fused carbazole, while that of 3,6&#8208;bis(m&#8208;terphenyl&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,8&#8208;diphenylcarbazole afforded a bis(quaterphenyl)&#8208;fused carbazole. Borylation of the latter furnished a B,N&#8208;embedded helical nanographene binding a fluoride anion via a structural change from the three&#8208;coordinate boron to the four&#8208;coordinate boron. The anionic charge derived from the fluoride anion is stabilized over the expanded &#960;&#8208;framework, which leads to the high binding constant (Ka) of 1&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1. The four&#8208;coordinate boron species was converted back to the parent three&#8208;coordinate boron species with Ag+, and the chiroptical switch between the three&#8208;coordinate boron and four&#8208;coordinate boron species has been achieved via the ion recognition with the change in the color and glum values.

&lt;p&gt;Intramolecular oxidative aromatic coupling of 3,6-bis(&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-terphenyl-2&#8217;-yl)carbazole provided a bis(&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-terphenyl)-fused carbazole, while that of 3,6-bis(&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-terphenyl-2&#8217;-yl)-1,8-diphenylcarbazole afforded a bis(quaterphenyl)-fused carbazole.

         <title>Fluorescent Macrocyclic Arenes: Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review provides a comprehensive summary of the synthesis, properties, and applications of fluorescent macrocyclic arenes (FMAs) composed of polycyclic aromatic or heteroaromatic skeletons that have emerged in the past decade. The FMAs are categorized on the basis of the different building blocks incorporated.







Abstract
Fluorescent macrocyclic arenes have attracted increasing interest in macrocyclic and supramolecular chemistry due to their exceptional photophysical properties and versatile applications. Classical macrocyclic arenes modified with fluorescent groups at the upper or bottom rims have long provided valuable platforms across various fields. Recently, a large number of novel fluorescent macrocyclic arenes directly composed of polycyclic aromatic or heteroaromatic building blocks including naphthalene, anthracene, tetraphenylethene, pyrene, fluorene, carbazole, acridan, phenothiazine, coumarin, triphenylamine, benzothiadiazole and so on, have been reported, and they have shown specific fluorescent property, and also exhibited broad applications in molecular recognition, sensing, bioimaging and functional materials. In this review, we focus on the recent advances in the synthesis and applications of fluorescent macrocyclic arenes containing polycyclic aromatic or heteroaromatic skeletons emerged in the past decade. By categorizing these fluorescent macrocyclic arenes based on the different building blocks, this review provides a comprehensive summary of their synthesis, properties and applications.

         <title>Ultrafast Water Purification by Template&#8208;Free Nanoconfined Catalysts Derived from Municipal Sludge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A template&#8208;free approach transforms municipal sludge into high&#8208;performance nanoconfined catalysts by leveraging selective hydrofluoric acid corrosion to manipulate micro&#8208;mesoporous structures. Atomically dispersed Fe centers are confined, resulting in a shift of reaction mechanism and achieving a impressive 261&#8208;fold increase in catalytic pollutant degradation. This scalable method not only tackles waste management but also offers a sustainable route for manufacturing advanced catalysts, contributing to water purification and global waste upcycling efforts.







Abstract
Nanoconfinement at the interface of heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;like catalysts offers promising avenues for advancing oxidation processes in water purification. Herein, we introduce a template&#8208;free strategy for synthesizing nanoconfined catalysts from municipal sludge (S&#8208;NCCs), specifically engineered to optimize reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and utilization for rapid pollutant degradation. Using selective hydrofluoric acid corrosion, we create an architecture that confines atomically dispersed Fe centers within a micro&#8208;mesoporous carbon matrix in situ. This method maximizes the utilization of silicon and aluminum content from sludge, prevents metal agglomeration, and precisely regulates the chemical environment of Fe active sites. As a result, the S&#8208;NCCs promote a transition from nonradical to hybrid radical/nonradical reaction mechanisms, significantly enhancing ROS efficiency, stability, and pollutant degradation rates. These catalysts demonstrate exceptional pollutant removal performance, achieving a 261&#8208;fold increase in degradation efficiency for compounds such as phenol and sulfamethoxazole compared to unconfined analogs, outperforming most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Fenton&#8208;like systems. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of nanoconfined catalysis in environmental applications, providing an effective and scalable solution for sustainable water purification.

         <title>Tailored Polymer&#8208;Inorganic Bilayer SEI with Proton Holder Feature for Aqueous Zn Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bilayer/P&#8722;F SEI with proton holder feature is designed to stabilize Zn anode at high current densities and areal capacities. The inner ZnF2 has high stiffness and strength, effectively suppressing Zn dendrites. The outer polyaniline (PANI) regulates current distribution across the Zn surface and delays the Sand's time of dendrites growth. Meanwhile, the =N&#8722; group in PANI serves as a reversible proton holder, thereby inhibiting HER.







Abstract
Conventional solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries mainly acts as a physical barrier to prevent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), while such SEI is prone to structural deterioration stemming from uneven Zn deposition at high current densities. Herein, we propose an in situ structural design of polymer&#8208;inorganic bilayer SEI with a proton holder feature by aniline&#8208;modulated electrolytes. The Zn(OTF)2 exhibits a lower LUMO energy level in comparison to aniline, resulting in the formation of a bilayer structure characterized by an inner ZnF2 layer and an outer polyaniline (PANI) layer. The ZnF2 with high stiffness and strength effectively suppresses Zn dendrites. Meanwhile, the PANI regulates the current distribution, minimizing the concentration gradient, and delays the Sand's time of dendrites growth. Furthermore, the =N&#8722; in PANI is capable of reversible proton holder, thereby inhibiting HER. With this bilayer SEI, the Zn anode achieves an impressive cycle life of 126&#8197;h under 40&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 &amp; 40&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (depth of discharge, DOD=70.8&#8201;%), solving the bottleneck of single&#8208;layer inorganic SEI that could not be cycled under these conditions. The Zn&#8201;||&#8201;NaVO pouch battery with bilayer SEI exhibits a high capacity of 1.2&#8197;Ah and a cycle life of 350&#8197;h with 78&#8201;% capacity retention. At &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C, the same battery delivers a capacity of 335&#8197;mAh and a cycle life of 507&#8197;h with 72&#8201;% capacity retention, attributed to the modulation mechanism of the hydrogen bonding in the electrolyte. Our findings offer profound insights into the design of SEI with tailored structure and functionality, paving the way for the next generation of advanced high&#8208;performance batteries.

         <title>An sp2 Carbon&#8208;Conjugated Covalent Organic Framework for Fusing Lipid Droplets and Engineered Macrophage Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a &#8220;lipid droplet fusion&#8221; strategy for engineering macrophages, promoting their antitumor activation. The mildly synthesized sp2C&#8208;conjugated covalent organic framework (COF) UM&#8208;101 induces lipid droplet fusion and metabolic reprogramming of macrophages. The intravenous injection of UM&#8208;101&#8211;engineered macrophages effectively inhibited CT26 tumor progression.







Abstract
Engineered immune cell therapy has proven to be a transformative cancer treatment despite the challenges of its prohibitive costs and manufacturing complexity. In this study, we propose a concise &#8220;lipid droplet fusion&#8221; strategy for engineering macrophages. Because of the integration of hydrophobic alkyl chains and &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures, the mildly synthesized sp2C&#8208;conjugated covalent organic framework (COF) UM&#8208;101 induced lipid droplet fusion and metabolic reprogramming of macrophages, thus promoting their antitumor classical activation. Intravenous injection of UM&#8208;101&#8211;engineered macrophages effectively inhibited tumor progression. These results represent the first report of room&#8208;temperature synthesis of sp2C&#8208;conjugated COFs for engineered immune cell therapy, providing a new perspective for the development of therapeutic immune cells via organelle manipulation.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Separated Spiropyran Coacervates as Dual&#8208;Wavelength&#8208;Switchable Reactive Oxygen Generators</title>

Photochemical reactions of the spiropyran coacervates in aqueous solution, in cells, and in animals enable dual&#8208;wavelength&#8208;switchable ROS generation and cancer treatment.







Abstract
Low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight compounds of certain structural features may form coacervates through liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS). These coacervates can enter mammalian cells and affect cellular physiology. Controlling the properties of the coacervates inside cells, however, is a challenge. Here, we report photochemical reactions of spiropyran (SP)&#8208;based coacervates with two wavelengths of light, in vitro, in the cell, and in animals, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) for photo&#8208;controlled cell killing. We identify an SP&#8208;containing compound, SP&#8208;PEG8&#8208;SP, that forms coacervates (SP&#8208;C) in the aqueous solution. Photo illumination by a UV light triggers the isomerization of SP to merocyanine (MC), switching SP&#8208;C to the fluorescent coacervates MC&#8208;C. A visible light converts MC&#8208;C back to SP&#8208;C and induces ROS generation. Notably, coacervate formation increases the compound's ROS generation efficiency. The SP&#8208;C/MC&#8208;C coacervate system (collectively called spiropyran coacervates) can spontaneously enter cells, and a dual&#8208;wavelength&#8208;controlled reversible on/off switch and spatiotemporal&#8208;resolved ROS production is realized within the cytoplasm. Light&#8208;induced ROS generation leads to cytotoxicity to cancer cells, tumor organoids, and tumors in vivo, supporting spiropyran coacervates&#8217; potential use as coacervate photosensitizers in photodynamic therapies.

         <title>Contrasting Mechanochromic Luminescence of Enantiopure and Racemic Pyrenylprolinamides: Elucidating Solid&#8208;State Excimer Orientation by Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Contrasting mechanochromic luminescence (MCL) has been observed for enantiopure and racemic crystals of pyrenylprolinamides with different substituents. Enantiopure crystals exhibited circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), and mechanochromic CPL was achieved due to the formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonded excimers in the amorphous state. For the first time, the amorphous&#8208;state CPL was elucidated based on the excimer chirality rule.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and mechanochromic luminescence (MCL) have independently made substantial progress in recent years. However, the exploration of MCL in solid&#8208;state CPL materials, which holds practical significance, is still in its infancy. Herein, we report the MCL properties of readily accessible chiral pyrenylprolinamides bearing tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl (Boc) or 2,2,2&#8208;trichloroethoxycarbonyl (Troc) groups. Enantiopure crystals of the Boc derivative display a greater MCL wavelength shift than racemic crystals, while the Troc derivative exhibit the opposite trend. Most notably, the enantiopure crystals show mechanochromic CPL. Unlike in previous examples, where CPL is quenched upon amorphization, robust CPL spectra were observed even in the amorphous states. By applying the excimer chirality rule, we have, for the first time, acquired insights into the excited&#8208;state structures within mechanically generated amorphous states. These findings offer a novel design strategy for developing mechanochromic CPL materials, paving the way for the future advancements in this emerging field.

Two&#8208; and threefold&#8208;fused bipolar dyes based on naphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;dicarboximide and various electron&#8208;rich motifs were synthesized by a facile and efficient cascade process with cesium carbonate. These polyaromatic systems could not be obtained by transition&#8208;metal catalysis.







Abstract
The development of straightforward synthetic methods for photoactive polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that avoid Pd&#8208;catalyzed or radical&#8208;based processes remains a challenge. Such methods are essential to reducing the cost and environmental impact of organic photodevices. In this work, we present a one&#8208;pot synthetic approach for creating novel bipolar PAHs with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation, which are not accessible via conventional Pd&#8208;catalyzed routes. Our cascade process operates exclusively under basic conditions, utilizing cesium carbonate and molecular sieves to facilitate the coupling of electron&#8208;deficient 4&#8208;fluoronaphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;dicarboximide with halogenated electron&#8208;rich moieties. This results in the regio&#8208; and chemoselective formation of new 6&#8208; and/or 5&#8208;membered conjugated rings via consecutive SNAr reactions, as confirmed through experimental and computational studies. The resulting PAHs exhibit strong emissive properties, with quantum yields ranging from 34&#8201;% to 99&#8201;%. This work provides a simple and efficient synthetic strategy for producing novel semiconducting materials, offering a new framework for designing bipolar PAHs with distinct optical characteristics.

         <title>In Situ Growth of Metal&#8208;Organic Layer on Polyoxometalate&#8208;etching Cu2O to Boost CO2 Reduction with High Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
POM&#8208;etching for in situ growth of metal&#8208;organic layer can simultaneously incorporate electron sponge and protective layer into Cu2O. The resulting ternary composites exhibit exceptional robustness and achieve efficient CO2 conversion to HCOOH with a yield 55 times higher than that of binary Cu2O@HKUST.







Abstract
Low&#8208;cost Cu2O with a suitable band gap holds great potential for solar utilization. However severe photocorrosion and weak CO2 capture capability have significantly hindered their application in artificial photosynthesis. Herein, polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;etching and in situ growth of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) can simultaneously incorporate electron&#8208;sponge and HKUST protective layer into Cu2O. The resulting ternary composites Cu2O@POM@HKUST&#8208;n (POM=PMo12O40 and PW12O40) with dual hetero&#8208;interfaces can efficiently convert CO2 to HCOOH with 5226&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 yield, over 5 and 55 times higher than that of Cu2O (1010&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1) and Cu2O@HKUST (95.02&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1). In situ XPS and DFT studies reveal that Cu mainly existed in the form of Cu2O and Cu&#8208;MOF, while a unique Cux+ (1&lt;x&#8804;2) surface layer formed upon the Cu2O matrix surrounding POMs for CO2 absorption and activation. Systematic investigations demonstrate that the electron&#8208;sponge can efficiently capture electrons from excited Cu2O to promote the generation of a Cux+ surface layer, while the closely surface&#8208;coating metal&#8208;organic layer can act as protective layer and CO2 adsorbent. This dual function concurrently contributes to promote photocatalysis and prevent Cu2O degradation. Remarkably, the composites exhibit much enhanced photochemical stability and can be used for over 60&#8197;h without noticeable activity loss.

         <title>Achieving High Solid&#8211;Liquid Ratio through Competitive Coordination towards Efficient Recovery of Metals from Spent Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enhance the potential of DESs for practical applications, we propose a novel competition coordination strategy for designing the ternary DESs, which can reinforce the construction of H&#8208;bond interaction and facilitate the exsolution of the ligand (OxA), leading to an enhanced mass transfer kinetic and an excellent selective precipitation of metals (Ni).







Abstract
The recycling of critical metals from spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries represents a significant step towards meeting the enhancing resource requirements in the new energy industry. Nevertheless, achieving effective leaching of metals from the stable metal&#8208;oxygen (MO6) structure of spent ternary cathodes and separation of metal products simultaneously still remained a huge challenge towards industrial applications. Herein, a competitive coordination strategy was proposed to design a novel deep eutectic solvent (DESs), which improved both leaching and selective metal recycling capacity even at high solid&#8211;liquid ratio (1&#8201;:&#8201;10). The results demonstrated that the number of hydrogen bonds in designed ternary DESs was 16.5&#8201;% higher compared to those in the binary DESs, resulting in efficient reaction kinetics to break the metals&#8208;oxygen bond. More importantly, the competing&#8208;ligand (p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid) could preferentially enter into the first nanostructure sheath and reduce the proportion of solvated oxalic acid (OxA) from 28.36&#8201;% to 17.76&#8201;% within the nanostructure, which enable OxA molecules to enhance the coordination interaction with metal for precipitating NiC2O4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O product (~95.7&#8201;% purity) from spent cathodes. This work achieved impressive profitability ($16.05 per kg feedstock) and effectively reduction of GHG emissions during the recycling process, making it applicable to critical sustainability initiatives.

     alt="Achieving High Solid&#8211;Liquid Ratio through Competitive Coordination towards Efficient Recovery of Metals from Spent Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enhance the potential of DESs for practical applications, we propose a novel competition coordination strategy for designing the ternary DESs, which can reinforce the construction of H-bond interaction and facilitate the exsolution of the ligand (OxA), leading to an enhanced mass transfer kinetic and an excellent selective precipitation of metals (Ni).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recycling of critical metals from spent lithium-ion batteries represents a significant step towards meeting the enhancing resource requirements in the new energy industry. Nevertheless, achieving effective leaching of metals from the stable metal-oxygen (MO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) structure of spent ternary cathodes and separation of metal products simultaneously still remained a huge challenge towards industrial applications. Herein, a competitive coordination strategy was proposed to design a novel deep eutectic solvent (DESs), which improved both leaching and selective metal recycling capacity even at high solid&#8211;liquid ratio (1&#8201;:&#8201;10). The results demonstrated that the number of hydrogen bonds in designed ternary DESs was 16.5&#8201;% higher compared to those in the binary DESs, resulting in efficient reaction kinetics to break the metals-oxygen bond. More importantly, the competing-ligand (p-toluenesulfonic acid) could preferentially enter into the first nanostructure sheath and reduce the proportion of solvated oxalic acid (OxA) from 28.36&#8201;% to 17.76&#8201;% within the nanostructure, which enable OxA molecules to enhance the coordination interaction with metal for precipitating NiC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O product (~95.7&#8201;% purity) from spent cathodes. This work achieved impressive profitability ($16.05 per kg feedstock) and effectively reduction of GHG emissions during the recycling process, making it applicable to critical sustainability initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Adjusting TADF and Phosphorescence for Tailored Dynamic Time&#8208;Dependent Afterglow Colored Carbon Dots spanning Full Visible Region</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a convenient strategy to achieve TDAC CDs that cover the entire visible region. By optimizing the doping level of Pyr&#8208;CDs and embedding them in different rigid matrices, we can effectively tailor various color variations of the afterglow within the visible region. The successful utilization of 4D coding technique for multimodal anti&#8208;counterfeiting and advanced dynamic information encryption promotes the practical applications of afterglow materials.







Abstract
Time&#8208;dependent afterglow colored (TDAC) behavior differs from static afterglow by involving wavelength changes, enabling low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;level encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. However, the existing carbon dot (CD)&#8208;based TDAC materials lack a clear mechanistic explanation and controllable wavelength changes, significantly hindering the progress of practical applications in this field. In this study, we synthesized CDs composites with customizable tunable TDAC wavelengths across the visible region. Furthermore, we elucidated the underlying mechanism of TDAC that exhibits sequential weakening and relative strengthening of long&#8208; and short&#8208;wavelength afterglow centers. This phenomenon arises due to strong emission with a short lifetime originating from long&#8208;wavelength thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), along with weak emission having a longer lifetime originating from short&#8208;wavelength phosphorescence. The presence of surface&#8208;rich carboxyl groups on CDs determines the short&#8208;wavelength afterglow in their dispersed state while their high conjugation degree governs the long&#8208;wavelength afterglow in their aggregated state. Additionally, appropriate doping levels of CDs enhance color change phenomena during afterglow. Finally, by embedding CDs into different rigid matrix, the range of afterglow changes can be tailored arbitrarily within the visible light region. Leveraging these exceptional TDAC characteristics has allowed us to successfully develop advanced 4D coding technologies that facilitate multi&#8208;mode anti&#8208;counterfeiting and dynamic information encryption.

         <title>Confining Phosphoric Acid in Quaternized COF Channels for Ultra&#8208;Stable and Fast Anhydrous Proton Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quaternized covalent organic framework membranes (QACOFMs) with different positively charged groups were fabricated. The strong confinement effect affords ultrahigh H3PO4 retention capability under hydration condition, and the suitable H&#8208;bond length between H3PO4 and highly interconnected H&#8208;bond network enables ultra&#8208;fast anhydrous proton transport.







Abstract
Phosphoric acid (H3PO4) doping is a widely employed strategy to facilitate anhydrous proton transport in high&#8208;temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells (HT&#8208;PEMFCs). However, significant H3PO4 leaching during long&#8208;term operation poses critical challenges to maintaining membrane stability and proton conductivity. Herein, H3PO4 is incorporated into positively charged nanochannels of quaternized covalent organic framework membranes (QACOFMs), leveraging strong electrostatic interactions and confinement effects to achieve exceptional H3PO4 retention under hydration conditions. Moreover, the shortened hydrogen bond length between H3PO4 (O&#8722;H&#8230;O &lt;2.7&#8201;&#197;) and the highly interconnected hydrogen bond network in the H3PO4@QACOFMs facilitate ultra&#8208;fast anhydrous proton transport. As a result, the H3PO4@QACOFMs exhibit superior anhydrous proton transport in a broader temperature range (60&#8201;&#176;C&#8211;200&#8201;&#176;C) and the highest proton conductivity reaches about 379.7&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 200&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Modulating Built&#8208;In Electric Field Strength in Ru/RuO2 Interfaces through Ni Doping to Enhance Hydrogen Conversion at Ampere&#8208;level Current</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We use DFT calculations to identify Ni&#8208;RuO2 as the most promising candidate among 3d transition metal&#8208;doped M&#8208;RuO2 (M=Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn). Ni&#8208;RuO2 is experimentally synthesized confirming that introducing Ni atoms promotes the partial reduction of RuO2 to form a Ni&#8722;Ru/RuO2 interface with a strong built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) during electrochemical processes. Consequently, the Ni&#8208;RuO2 catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 134&#8197;mV at 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The Ni&#8208;RuO2&#8208;based AEMWE in 1&#8197;M KOH delivers a voltage of only 1.71&#8197;V to reach 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 1000&#8197;h stable operation.







Abstract
Improving the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) efficiency is essential for developing advanced anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) that operate at industrial ampere&#8208;level currents. Herein, we employ density functional theory (DFT) calculations to identify Ni&#8208;RuO2 as the leading candidate among various 3d transition metal&#8208;doped M&#8208;RuO2 (where metal M includes Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn). The incorporation of Ni atoms facilitates the partial reduction of RuO2, resulting in the formation of a Ni&#8722;Ru/RuO2 interface having a significant built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) during electrochemical reactions. The resulted BIEF enhances electron transfer across the interface, which is critical in lowering energy barriers and accelerating the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics. As a result, the Ni&#8208;RuO2 catalyst exhibits an overpotential of 134&#8197;mV at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a low Tafel slope of 20.85&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, with just 0.03&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 of Ru loading. The highly effective BIEF, therefore, plays a pivotal role in the catalyst&#8216;s remarkable performance, allowing the Ni&#8208;RuO2&#8208;based AEMWE to require only 1.71&#8197;V to maintain stable operation at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over a 1000&#8208;hour period.

         <title>CO Adsorption on a Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst Stably Embedded in Graphene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the chemical activity of isolated metal atoms confined in graphene on Ni(111), using carbon monoxide as a probe molecule. At room temperature, CO stably adsorbs on Co but not on Ni. Electronic descriptors clarify this behavior, offering valuable insights for designing graphene&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts.







Abstract
Confined single metal atoms in graphene&#8208;based materials have proven to be excellent catalysts for several reactions and promising gas sensing systems. However, whether the chemical activity arises from the specific type of metal atom or is a direct consequence of the confinement itself remains unclear.

         <title>New Thermoplastic Elastomers based on Ethylene&#8208;Butadiene&#8208;Rubber (EBR) by Switching from Anionic to Coordinative Chain Transfer Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermoplastic elastomers: Olefin triblock copolymers based on glassy polystyrene, ethylene butadiene rubber and highly crystalline polyethylene segments are prepared using a switch strategy from anionic polymerization to coordinative chain transfer (co)polymerization. They display low&#8208;viscosity above the melting point of PE and high elastic performances upon crystallization of PE segments.







Abstract
Olefin triblock copolymers based on glassy polystyrene (PS), ethylene butadiene rubber (EBR) and highly crystalline polyethylene (PE) segments were prepared for the first time using a switch strategy from anionic polymerization to coordinative chain transfer (co)polymerization (CCT(co)P). PS chains obtained by anionic polymerization were transmetalated with mesitylmagnesium bromide (BrMgMes) to act as macromolecular chain transfer agents (macro&#8208;CTA, PS&#8208;MgMes) in the CCTcoP of ethylene and butadiene using {Me2Si(C13H8)2Nd(BH4)2Li(THF)}2 complex (1). Further chain extension by CCTP using pure ethylene in the monomer feed afforded well&#8208;defined PS&#8208;b&#8208;EBR&#8208;b&#8208;PE triblock copolymers. The structural, rheological and mechanical properties of these materials demonstrate excellent balance between properties and easy processability at moderate temperatures (&gt;150&#8201;&#176;C). We demonstrate that such triblock copolymers behave effectively as low&#8208;viscosity PS&#8208;b&#8208;EBR diblock copolymers above the melting point of PE domains and high performance thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) upon crystallization of PE segments.

         <title>Enzymatic Cascades for Stereoselective and Regioselective Amide Bond Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amide bond synthetase (ABS) enzymes catalyse amide formation in an environmentally friendly manner. This study advances the application of ABS by integrating these enzymes with other compatible biocatalysts, creating enantioselective and scalable cascade reactions to produce valuable amide products from abundant nitrile precursors. Furthermore, two innovative methods for C&#8722;H bond amidation of aromatic compounds are introduced.







Abstract
Amide bond formation is fundamental in nature and is widely used in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and other valuable products. Current methods for amide synthesis are often step and atom inefficient, requiring the use of protecting groups, deleterious reagents and organic solvents that create significant waste. The development of cleaner and more efficient catalytic methods for amide synthesis remains an urgent unmet need. Herein, we present novel biocatalytic cascade reactions for synthesising various amides under mild aqueous conditions from readily available organic nitriles combining nitrile hydrolysing enzymes and amide bond synthetase enzymes. These cooperative biocatalytic cascades enable kinetic resolution of racemic nitriles and provide a highly enantioselective biocatalytic extension of the Strecker reaction. The regioselective non&#8208;directed C&#8722;H bond amidation of simple arenes was demonstrated through the incorporation of photoredox catalysis to the front end of the cascade. C&#8722;H bond amidation of simple aromatic precursors was also achieved via a CO2 fixation cascade combining enzymatic carboxylation and amide bond synthesis in one&#8208;pot.

         <title>Isolation and Structure Elucidation of the Heterocumulene Anions [NCC&#8208;L]&#8722; (L=CO, CS, N2)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cumulated 5&#8208;atomic cyanodiazomethanide [NCCNN]&#8722; and thioketenyl anion [NCCCS]&#8722; were synthesized from the metalated ylide and ketenyl anion, respectively. Both anions exhibit unexpected stability, but with notable structural differences. While the cyanodiazomethanide features a distinctly bent geometry, the thioketenyl anion was found to be linear, which can be explained by to the stronger &#960;&#8208;accepting properties of the CS ligand.







Abstract
Cumulenes are molecules characterized by a series of consecutive double bonds. They serve as important reagents and intermediates in the synthesis of polymers and a wide variety of functionalized compounds, including various heterocycles. Understanding the properties of cumulenes and developing synthetic routes to these often highly reactive species is essential for unlocking new applications. Here, we report the synthesis and isolation of the cyanodiazomethanide [NCCNN]&#8722; and cyanothioketenyl anion [NCCCS]&#8722;. These 5&#8208;atomic anions exhibit unexpected stabilities but distinct structural differences. Despite the explosive nature of diazoacetonitrile, the [NCCNN]&#8722; anion was sufficiently stable at 0&#8201;&#176;C to allow for first reactivity studies and its structure elucidation revealing a bent structure. The thioketenyl anion is stable at room&#8208;temperature and can be accessed from the cyanoketenyl anion [NCCCO]&#8722; via a [2+2] cycloaddition and cycloreversion sequence with COS elimination. Comparative structural, spectroscopic and computational studies including those on the cyanoketenyl anion [NCCCO]&#8722;, demonstrate that the degree of bending of these heterocumulene anions [NCC&#8208;L]&#8722; can be explained by a transition in the bonding situation from a cumulene structure to an anionic carbone, with the strongly &#960; accepting CS ligand leading to a linear structure of the thioketenyl anion.

Electrostatic interaction between a dendritic host (8CzTPS) with a strong positive electrostatic potential (ESP) and a dendritic emitter (D2&#8208;DBN) with multiple negative ESP sites was used to induce a high horizontal dipole orientation of 83.0&#8201;% for the emitter in solution&#8208;processed films. The resulting blue narrowband device realizes an external quantum efficiency of 35.3&#8201;% and narrow bandwidth of 17&#8197;nm.







Abstract
The multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) device has drawn great attention due to their outstanding efficiency and color purity. However, the efficiency of solution&#8208;processed MR&#8208;TADF devices is still far behind their vacuum&#8208;deposited counterparts, due to the uncontrollable horizontal emitting dipole orientation for emitters during solution process, resulting in low light out&#8208;coupling efficiency. Here, we proposed a new strategy namely electrostatic interaction between a dendritic host with high positive electrostatic potential (ESP) and dendritic emitter with multiple negative ESP sites, which could induce high horizontal dipole ratio (&#920;||) up to 83.0&#8201;% in solution&#8208;processed films. For this couple, the largest plane of dendritic host tends to anchor on the substrate, and thus the strong positive electrostatic site mainly lies at the exposed tetraphenylsilicon, which could electrostatically attract the multiple negative electrostatic sites of the dendritic emitter, realizing horizontal dipole orientation. Moreover, the highly twisted structure of dendritic host and dendron encapsulation of emitter could effectively suppress aggregation, leading a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 98.6&#8201;%. As a result, the solution&#8208;processed blue MR&#8208;TADF devices exhibit a record&#8208;break external quantum efficiency of 35.3&#8201;%, as well as narrow bandwidth of 17&#8197;nm and pure blue color with CIE coordinates of (0.137, 0.176).

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalization of Peptides Directed by a Removable, Backbone&#8208;Inserted Amidoxime Ether</title>

         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H arylation of peptides has been developed, directed by an amidoxime ether, which can be incorporated into peptides at any amide bond. The backbone&#8208;installed directing group facilitates site&#8208; and stereoselective arylation of peptides, including at internal residues. Removal of the amidoxime ether generates the parent amide enabling a traceless C&#8722;H functionalization process.







Abstract
Palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization has attracted considerable attention as a pathway to late&#8208;stage modification of peptides. Herein, we report the Pd&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H arylation of peptides directed by an amidoxime ether, which can be easily incorporated into peptides at any amide bond. Site&#8208; and stereoselective arylation of peptides has been achieved, including unprecedented functionalization of internal residues of native peptides. Removal of the amidoxime ether was achieved to generate the parent amide and facilitate a traceless C&#8722;H functionalization process.

         <title>Porous Organic Polymers Incorporating Shape&#8208;Persistent Cyclobenzoin Macrocycles for Organic Solvent Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A macrocyclic porous organic polymer has been synthesized for the efficient separation of organic solvents. The resulting polymer exhibits high uptake capacities for small solvents, correlating with their kinetic diameters, and effectively differentiates between xylene isomers. These findings highlight the potential of porous organic polymers in advanced solvent separation technologies.







Abstract
The recovery and separation of organic solvents is highly important for the chemical industry and environmental protection. In this context, porous organic polymers (POPs) have significant potential owing to the possibility of integrating shape&#8208;persistent macrocyclic units with high guest selectivity. Here, we report the synthesis of a macrocyclic porous organic polymer (np&#8208;POP) and the corresponding model compound by reacting the cyclotetrabenzil naphthalene octaketone macrocycle with 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetraaminobenzene and 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzene, respectively, under solvothermal conditions. Co&#8208;crystallization of the macrocycle and the model compound with various solvent molecules revealed their size&#8208;selective inclusion within the macrocycle. Building on this finding, the np&#8208;POP with a hierarchical pore structure and a surface area of 579&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 showed solvent uptake strongly correlated with their kinetic diameters. Solvents with kinetic diameters below 0.6&#8197;nm &#8211; such as acetonitrile and dichloromethane &#8211; showed high uptake capacities exceeding 7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1. Xylene separation tests revealed a high overall uptake (~34&#8197;wt&#8201;%), with o&#8208;xylene displaying a significantly lower uptake (~10&#8197;wt&#8201;% less than other isomers), demonstrating the possibility of size and shape selective separation of organic solvents.

         <title>Tunable Organic&#8208;Inorganic p&#8208;&#960;&#8208;d Electron Conjugation Triggers d&#8208;&#960; Hybridization in Quinonized MnO2 Superlattice toward Ultrastable and High&#8208;Rate Zn&#8722;MnO2 Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
The tunable organic&#8211;inorganic&#8208;extended p&#8208;&#960;&#8208;d electron conjugation of quinonized superlattice, inducing more dxy orbitals occupancy, more polarons near Fermi level, the downshift of O p band center, and reinforced Mn&#8722;O &#960;&#8208;type orbitals hybrid, which successively contributes to the significant improvement of electrochemical activity, diffusion kinetics of Zn2+ and structure stability.







Abstract
Zn&#8208;MnO2 batteries with two&#8208;electron transfer harvest high energy density, high working voltage, inherent safety, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Zn2+ as the dominant charge carriers suffer from sluggish kinetics due to the strong Zn2+&#8722;MnO2 coulombic interaction, which is also the origin of pestilent MnO2 lattice deformation and performance degradation. Current studies particularly involve H+ insertion&#8208;dominating chemistry, where the long&#8208;term cycle stability remains challenging due to the accumulative Zn2+ insertion and structural collapse. Herein, a simultaneously enhanced and stabilized Zn2+/H+ co&#8208;insertion chemistry is proposed by the quinone&#8208;hybridized MnO2 superlattice, a first&#8208;of&#8208;this&#8208;kind structure with a distinctive organic&#8211;inorganic&#8208;extended p&#8208;&#960;&#8208;d conjugation, which enables a tunable interlayer d&#8208;&#960; hybridization. Theoretical and experimental results substantiate that the interlayer d&#8208;&#960; hybridization triggers the enhancement of polarons occupancy near Fermi level, the downward shift of O p&#8208;band center, the elevated Mn t2g occupation and thus improved [MnO6] stability upon unprecedentedly high Zn2+ contribution. The notable d&#8208;&#960; hybridization endows MnO2 superlattice an ultrahigh specific capacity (435.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.25&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art cycle stability (~100&#8201;% capacity retention after 30,000 cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) with substantially enhanced rate performance. Our findings enlighten a new paradigm in the adjustment of Zn2+/H+ co&#8208;insertion chemistry towards high&#8208;performance rechargeable aqueous batteries.
