         <title>A General Approach to Convert Hemicyanine Dyes into Highly Optimized Photoacoustic Scaffolds for Analyte Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most photoacoustic (PA) imaging agents are based on the repurposing of existing fluorescent dye platforms that exhibit non&#8208;optimal properties for PA applications. Herein, we introduce PA&#8208;HD, a new dye scaffold optimized for PA probe development which features an increase in sensitivity of 4.8&#8208;fold and a red&#8208;shift of the &#955;  abs  from 690 nm to 745 nm to enable ratiometric imaging. Computational modelling was employed to elucidate the origin of these enhanced properties. Moreover, to demonstrate the generalizability of our remodeling efforts, we developed three probes for &#946;&#8208;galactosidase activity (PA&#8208;HD&#8208;Gal), nitroreductase activity (PA&#8208;HD&#8208;NTR), and H  2  O  2  (PA&#8208;HD&#8208;H  2  O  2  ). We generated two cancer models to evaluate PA&#8208;HD&#8208;Gal and PA&#8208;HD&#8208;NTR. Additionally, we employed a murine model of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease to test PA&#8208;HD&#8208;H  2  O  2  . In this latter example, we observed a PA signal increase at 735 nm of 1.79 &#177; 0.20&#8208;fold relative to background indicating the presence of oxidative stress. These results were confirmed via ratiometric calibration which was not possible using the parent HD platform.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective &#945;&#8208;Etherification of Branched Aldehydes via an Oxidative Umpolung Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Saturated carbonyl compounds are, via their enolate analogs, inherently nucleophilic at the &#945;&#8208;position. In the presence of a benzoquinone oxidant, the polarity of the &#945;&#8208;position of racemic &#945;&#8208;branched aldehydes is inverted, allowing for an enantioselective etherification using readily available oxygen&#8208;based nucleophiles and an amino acid&#8208;derived primary amine catalyst. A survey of benzoquinone oxidants identified  p  &#8208;fluoranil and DDQ as suitable reaction partners.  p  &#8208;Fluoranil enables the preparation of &#945;&#8208;aryloxylated aldehydes using phenol nucleophiles in up to 91%  ee  , following either a one&#8208;step or a two&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot protocol. DDQ allows for a more general etherification protocol in combination with a broader range of alcohol nucleophiles with enantioselectivities up to 95%  ee  . Control experiments and isolation of a key quinol intermediate supports mechanism proceeding via a S  N  2 dynamic&#8208;kinetic resolution. These studies provide the basis for an aminocatalytic umpolung concept that allows for the asymmetric construction of tertiary ethers in the &#945;&#8208;position of aldehydes.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective Hydro(Chloro)pentafluorosulfanylation of Diazo Compounds with Pentafluorosulfanyl Chloride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical synthesis of SF5Cl from sulfur powder, dry KF, and trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCCA) in MeCN is described. The new synthetic utility of SF5Cl is well demonstrated by the chemoselective hydro(chloro)pentafluorosulfanylation of diazo compounds.







Abstract
Pentafluorosulfanyl chloride (SF5Cl) is the most prevalent reagent for the incorporation of SF5 group into organic compounds. However, the preparation of SF5Cl often relies on hazardous reagents and specialized apparatus. Herein, we described a safe and practical synthesis of a bench&#8208;stable and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle solution of SF5Cl in n&#8208;hexane under gas&#8208;reagent&#8208;free conditions. The synthetic application of SF5Cl was demonstrated through the unprecedented reaction with diazo compounds. The chemoselective hydro&#8208; and chloropentafluorosulfanylations of &#945;&#8208;diazo carbonyl compounds were developed in the presence of K3PO4 or copper catalyst, respectively. These reactions provide a direct and efficient access to various &#945;&#8208;pentafluorosulfanyl carbonyl compounds of high value for potential applications.

         <title>Molybdenum&#8208;Catalyzed Deoxygenative Cyclopropanation of 1,2&#8208;Dicarbonyl or Monocarbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Readily available and bench&#8208;stable 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds are shown to undergo Mo&#8208;catalyzed regiospecific deoxygenative cyclopropanation. This method has led to an array of valuable cyclopropanes in yields of up to 90&#8201;% and with exclusive regioselectivity. This strategy was further applied to the cyclopropanation of a simple monocarbonyl compound.







Abstract
The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation of alkenes by the decomposition of diazo compounds is a powerful and straightforward strategy to produce cyclopropanes, but is tempered by the potentially explosive nature of diazo substrates. Herein we report the Mo&#8208;catalyzed regiospecific deoxygenative cyclopropanation of readily available and bench&#8208;stable 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds, in which one of the two carbonyl groups acts as a carbene equivalent upon deoxygenation and engages in the subsequent cyclopropanation process. The use of a commercially available Mo catalyst afforded an array of valuable cyclopropanes with exclusive regioselectivity in up to 90&#8201;% yield. The synthetic utility of this method was further demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale syntheses, late&#8208;stage functionalization, and the cyclopropanation of a simple monocarbonyl compound. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that phosphine (or silane) acts as both a mild reductant and a good oxygen acceptor that efficiently regenerates the catalytically active Mo catalyst through reduction of the Mo&#8208;oxo complexes.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Dealkenylative Arylation of Alkenes with Arylboronic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed dealkenylative arylation of alkenes and 1,3&#8208;dienes with arylboronic compounds has been developed to provide an unconventional access to bi(hetero)aryls with excellent chemo&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
The C&#8722;C bond formation reaction represents a fundamental and important transformation in synthetic chemistry, and exploring new types of C&#8722;C bond formation reactions is recognized as appealing, yet challenging. Herein, we disclose the first example of rhodium&#8208;catalyzed dealkenylative arylation of alkenes with arylboronic compounds, thereby providing an unconventional access to bi(hetero)aryls with excellent chemoselectivity. In this method, C(aryl)&#8722;C(alkenyl) and C(alkenyl)&#8722;C(alkenyl) bonds in various alkenes and 1,3&#8208;dienes can be cleaved via a hydrometalation and followed by &#946;&#8208;carbon elimination pathway for Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reactions. Furthermore, a series of novel organic fluorescent molecules with excellent photophysical properties has been efficiently constructed with this protocol.

         <title>Atomic Tungsten on Graphene with Unique Coordination Enabling Kinetically Boosted Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic tungsten on graphene with a unique W state of the W&#8208;N2O2 structure are first used to decorate the separator of a Li&#8208;S battery to promote its electrochemical performance. The unique local coordination structure of W&#8208;O2N2&#8208;C moiety not only acts as an active site for anchoring lithium polysulfides, but also boosts their kinetic conversion via electrocatalysis.







Abstract
Use of catalytic materials is regarded as the most desirable strategy to cope with sluggish kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) transformation and severe shuttle effect in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with 100&#8201;% atom&#8208;utilization are advantagous in serving as anchoring and electrocatalytic centers for LiPSs. Herein, a novel kind of tungsten (W) SAC immobilized on nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (W/NG) with a unique W&#8208;O2N2&#8208;C coordination configuration and a high W loading of 8.6&#8197;wt&#8201;% is proposed by a self&#8208;template and self&#8208;reduction strategy. The local coordination environment of W atom endows the W/NG with elevated LiPSs adsorption ability and catalytic activity. LSBs equipped with W/NG modified separator manifest greatly improved electrochemical performances with high cycling stability over 1000&#8197;cycles and ultrahigh rate capability. It indicates high areal capacity of 6.24&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with robust cycling life at a high sulfur mass loading of 8.3&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>A Unified Approach for the Total Synthesis of cyclo&#8208;Archaeol, iso&#8208;Caldarchaeol, Caldarchaeol, and Mycoketide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclo&#8208;archaeol, iso&#8208;caldarchaeol, caldarchaeol, and mycoketide are prepared employing asymmetric hydrogenation to prepare the multiple stereocenters.







Abstract
Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric alkene hydrogenation is presented as the strategy par excellence to prepare saturated isoprenoids and mycoketides. This highly stereoselective synthesis approach is combined with an established 13C&#8208;NMR method to determine the enantioselectivity of each methyl&#8208;branched stereocenter. It is shown that this analysis is fit for purpose and the combination allows the synthesis of the title compounds with a significant increase in efficiency.

         <title>Head&#8208;to&#8208;Tail Oligomerization by Silylene&#8208;Tethered Sonogashira Coupling on Ag(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coupling module composed of (trimethylsilyl)ethynyl and chlorophenyl groups selectively accelerated sluggish desilylative on&#8208;surface Sonogashira coupling with homocoupling efficiently suppressed. Bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy/atomic force microscopy (STM/AFM) with a CO&#8208;functionalized tip enabled investigation of this coupling reaction and evaluation of its chemoselectivity (see picture).







Abstract
On&#8208;surface synthesis is a powerful method for the fabrication of &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanomaterials. Herein, we demonstrate chemoselective Sonogashira coupling between (trimethylsilyl)ethynyl and chlorophenyl groups in silylethynyl&#8208; and chloro&#8208;substituted partially fluorinated phenylene ethynylenes (SiCPFPEs) on Ag(111). The desilylative Sonogashira coupling occurred with high chemoselectivity up to 75&#8201;%, while the competing Ullmann and desilylative Glaser homocoupling reactions were suppressed. A combination of bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy/atomic force microscopy (STM/AFM) and DFT calculations revealed that the oligomers were obtained by the formation of intermolecular silylene tethers (&#8208;Me2Si&#8208;) through CH3&#8722;Si bond activation at 130&#8201;&#176;C and subsequent elimination of the tethers at an elevated temperature of 200&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Electrolyte Structure of Lithium Polysulfides with Anti&#8208;Reductive Solvent Shells for Practical Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrolyte structure of lithium polysulfides (PSs) with anti&#8208;reductive solvent shells was unveiled. The reduction resistance of the solvent shell is proven to be a key reason for the decreased reactivity of PSs towards Li. With isopropyl ether as a cosolvent, the reactivity of PSs is suppressed by encapsulating PSs into anti&#8208;reductive solvent shells. The stability of practical Li&#8211;S batteries was improved and a pouch cell of 300&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 was demonstrated.







Abstract
The lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery is regarded as a promising secondary battery. However, constant parasitic reactions between the Li anode and soluble polysulfide (PS) intermediates significantly deteriorate the working Li anode. The rational design to inhibit the parasitic reactions is plagued by the inability to understand and regulate the electrolyte structure of PSs. Herein, the electrolyte structure of PSs with anti&#8208;reductive solvent shells was unveiled by molecular dynamics simulations and nuclear magnetic resonance. The reduction resistance of the solvent shell is proven to be a key reason for the decreased reactivity of PSs towards Li. With isopropyl ether (DIPE) as a cosolvent, DIPE molecules tend to distribute in the outer solvent shell due to poor solvating power. Furthermore, DIPE is more stable than conventional ether solvents against Li metal. The reactivity of PSs is suppressed by encapsulating PSs into anti&#8208;reductive solvent shells. Consequently, the cycling performance of working Li&#8211;S batteries was significantly improved and a pouch cell of 300&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 was demonstrated. The fundamental understanding in this work provides an unprecedented ground to understand the electrolyte structure of PSs and the rational electrolyte design in Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Porous Covalent Organic Polymers for Efficient Fluorocarbon&#8208;Based Adsorption Cooling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first joint experimental&#8211;computational study of fluorocarbon adsorption into porous covalent organic polymers (COPs) reveals that the presence of structure defects leading to the creation of mesopores with a broad size range offers not only exceptional high&#8208;uptake adsorption of fluorocarbon R134a, but also unique overall linear&#8208;shaped isotherms. COPs are thus proven to be excellent sorbent materials for cooling applications.







Abstract
Adsorption&#8208;based cooling is an energy&#8208;efficient renewable&#8208;energy technology that can be driven using low&#8208;grade industrial waste heat and/or solar heat. Here, we report the first exploration of fluorocarbon adsorption using porous covalent organic polymers (COPs) for this cooling application. High fluorocarbon R134a equilibrium capacities and unique overall linear&#8208;shaped isotherms are revealed for the materials, namely COP&#8208;2 and COP&#8208;3. The key role of mesoporous defects on this unusual adsorption behavior was demonstrated by molecular simulations based on atomistic defect&#8208;containing models built for both porous COPs. Analysis of simulated R134a adsorption isotherms for various defect&#8208;containing atomistic models of the COPs shows a direct correlation between higher fluorocarbon adsorption capacities and increasing pore volumes induced by defects. Combined with their high porosities, excellent reversibility, fast kinetics, and large operating window, these defect&#8208;containing porous COPs are promising for adsorption&#8208;based cooling applications.

         <title>The Role of Rotational Motion in Diffusion NMR Experiments on Supramolecular Assemblies: Application to Sup35NM Fibrils</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diffusion of amyloid fibrils that contain disordered domains can be captured by pulsed&#8208;field&#8208;gradient NMR experiments. A new theory is presented that interprets the results of these measurements in terms of fibrils&#8217; translational and rotational motion. Application to Sup35NM fibrils demonstrates the feasibility of diffusion&#8208;based sorting in complex amyloidogenic samples.







Abstract
Pulsed&#8208;field gradient (PFG) NMR is an important tool for characterization of biomolecules and supramolecular assemblies. However, for micrometer&#8208;sized objects, such as amyloid fibrils, these experiments become difficult to interpret because in addition to translational diffusion they are also sensitive to rotational diffusion. We have constructed a mathematical theory describing the outcome of PFG NMR experiments on rod&#8208;like fibrils. To test its validity, we have studied the fibrils formed by Sup35NM segment of the prion protein Sup35. The interpretation of the PFG NMR data in this system is fully consistent with the evidence from electron microscopy. Contrary to some previously expressed views, the signals originating from disordered regions in the fibrils can be readily differentiated from the similar signals representing small soluble species (e.g. proteolytic fragments). This paves the way for diffusion&#8208;sorted NMR experiments on complex amyloidogenic samples.

         <title>In&#8208;Cell Characterization of the Stable Tyrosyl Radical in E. coli Ribonucleotide Reductase Using Advanced EPR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in vivo structure of the redox&#8208;active tyrosyl radical in ribonucleotide reductase that catalyses the biosynthesis of DNA building blocks was explored using advanced EPR spectroscopic techniques. Furthermore, the radical form of a tyrosine derivative within the cells was generated. Our results mark the initial steps towards gaining unique insights into the redox reactions involving tyrosyl radicals under physiological conditions.







Abstract
The E. coli ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), a paradigm for class Ia enzymes including human RNR, catalyzes the biosynthesis of DNA building blocks and requires a di&#8208;iron tyrosyl radical (Y122.) cofactor for activity. The knowledge on the in vitro Y122. structure and its radical distribution within the &#946;2 subunit has accumulated over the years; yet little information exists on the in vivo Y122.. Here, we characterize this essential radical in whole cells. Multi&#8208;frequency EPR and electron&#8208;nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) demonstrate that the structure and electrostatic environment of Y122. are identical under in vivo and in vitro conditions. Pulsed dipolar EPR experiments shed light on a distinct in vivo Y122. per &#946;2 distribution, supporting the key role of Y. concentrations in regulating RNR activity. Additionally, we spectroscopically verify the generation of an unnatural amino acid radical, F3Y122., in whole cells, providing a crucial step towards unique insights into the RNR catalysis under physiological conditions.

         <dc:description>
An efficient ODI&#8208;[5+2] cascade reaction of sensitive ethynylphenols was achieved under mild electrochemical conditions, which led to the rapid construction of a series of bicyclo[3.2.1]octadienone skeletons. By incorporation of a directed retro&#8208;aldol/aldol process, a [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement and an Al(O&#8208;iPr)3&#8208;promoted reductive 1,3&#8208;transposition, the asymmetric total syntheses of five 8,9&#8208;seco&#8208;ent&#8208;kauranoids have been accomplished.

         <title>Hydrogen Atom Transfer from HOO. to ortho&#8208;Quinones Explains the Antioxidant Activity of Polydopamine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polydopamine, a melanin analogue, is an excellent trap for alkylperoxyl radicals (ROO., typically formed during autoxidation of lipid substrates) only in the presence of hydroperoxyl radicals (HOO.). Activation of the ortho&#8208;quinones moieties by HOO., and formation of exposed semiquinones are proposed as the reason of the peculiar antioxidant activity.







Abstract
Melanins are stable and non&#8208;toxic biomaterials with a great potential as chemopreventive agents for diseases connected with oxidative stress, but the mechanism of their antioxidant action is unclear. Herein, we show that polydopamine (PDA), a well&#8208;known synthetic melanin, becomes an excellent trap for alkylperoxyl radicals (ROO., typically formed during autoxidation of lipid substrates) in the presence of hydroperoxyl radicals (HOO.). The key reaction explaining this peculiar antioxidant activity is the reduction of the ortho&#8208;quinone moieties present in PDA by the reaction with HOO.. This reaction occurs via a H&#8208;atom transfer mechanism, as demonstrated by the large kinetic solvent effect of the reaction of a model quinone (3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;benzoquinone) with HOO. (k=1.5&#215;107 and 1.1&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in PhCl and MeCN). The chemistry disclosed herein is an important step to rationalize the redox&#8208;mediated bioactivity of melanins and of quinones.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Single&#8208;Diamond&#8208;Surface Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silica scaffold with single&#8208;diamond&#8208;surface networks has been synthesized via self&#8208;assembly of the triblock terpolymer and inorganic source. The structural transition and the fluctuations of the Gaussian curvature are the key for the formation of the single&#8208;diamond structure.







Abstract
Biological scaffolds with hyperbolic surfaces, especially single gyroid and single&#8208;diamond structures, have sparked immense interest for creating novel materials due to their extraordinary physical properties. However, the ability of nature to create these unbalanced surfaces has not been achieved in either lyotropic liquid crystals or block copolymer phases due to their thermodynamical instability in these systems. Here, we report the synthesis of a porous silica scaffold with a single&#8208;diamond&#8208;surface structure fabricated by self&#8208;assembly of the poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;b&#8208;polystyrene&#8208;b&#8208;poly(L&#8208;lactide) and silica precursors in a mixed solvent of tetrahydrofuran and water. The single&#8208;diamond structure with tetrahedral interconnected frameworks was revealed by the electron crystallographic reconstruction. We assume that the formation of single networks is induced by the structural transition and related to the energetic change due to the fluctuations of the Gaussian curvature. This work may provide new insights into these biologically relevant surfaces and related self&#8208;assembly systems.

         <title>Getting Ready for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction: The Infrared Spectrum of Hydrated Aluminum Hydride&#8211;Hydroxide HAlOH+(H2O)n&#8722;1, n=9&#8211;14</title>

         <dc:description>
Water molecules must arrange around an aluminum hydride&#8211;hydroxide unit in a specific way to enable elimination of molecular hydrogen. Infrared multiple photon dissociation spectroscopy reveals that hydrogen bonding to the hydride takes place in a six&#8208;coordinate AlIII hydride&#8211;hydroxide complex. The smallest cluster size for which hydride hydrogen bonding dominates is also the cluster size for which hydrogen evolution becomes efficient.







Abstract
Hydrated singly charged aluminum ions eliminate molecular hydrogen in a size regime from 11 to 24 water molecules. Here we probe the structure of HAlOH+(H2O)n&#8722;1, n=9&#8211;14, by infrared multiple photon spectroscopy in the region of 1400&#8211;2250&#8197;cm&#8722;1. Based on quantum chemical calculations, we assign the features at 1940&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and 1850&#8197;cm&#8722;1 to the Al&#8722;H stretch in five&#8208; and six&#8208;coordinate aluminum(III) complexes, respectively. Hydrogen bonding towards the hydride is observed, starting at n=12. The frequency of the Al&#8722;H stretch is very sensitive to the structure of the hydrogen bonding network, and the large number of isomers leads to significant broadening and red&#8208;shifting of the absorption of the hydrogen&#8208;bonded Al&#8722;H stretch. The hydride can even act as a double hydrogen bond acceptor, shifting the Al&#8722;H stretch to frequencies below those of the water bending mode. The onset of hydrogen bonding and disappearance of the free Al&#8722;H stretch coincides with the onset of hydrogen evolution.

         <title>1,1,2&#8208;Ethenetriol: The Enol of Glycolic Acid, a High&#8208;Energy Prebiotic Molecule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The simple yet uncharacterized high energy tautomer of glycolic acid, namely 1,1,2&#8208;ethenetriol, an important molecule in the abiotic synthesis of sugar acids, has now been identified by IR and UV/Vis spectroscopy. With these data now in hand, it now awaits its identification in space as another building block for prebiotic chemistry.







Abstract
As low&#8208;temperature conditions (e.g. in space) prohibit reactions requiring large activation energies, an alternative mechanism for follow&#8208;up transformations of highly stable molecules involves the reactions of higher energy isomers that were generated in a different environment. Hence, one working model for the formation of larger organic molecules is their generation from high&#8208;lying isomers of otherwise rather stable molecules. As an example, we present here the synthesis as well as IR and UV/Vis spectroscopic identification of the previously elusive 1,1,2&#8208;ethenetriol, the higher energy enol tautomer of glycolic acid, a rather stable and hence unreactive biological building block. The title compound was generated in the gas phase by flash vacuum pyrolysis of tartronic acid at 400&#8201;&#176;C and was subsequently trapped in argon matrices at 10&#8197;K. The spectral assignments are supported by B3LYP/6&#8211;311++G(2d,2p) computations. Upon photolysis at &#955;=180&#8211;254&#8197;nm, 1,1,2&#8208;ethenetriol rearranges to glycolic acid and ketene.

         <dc:description>A new compound (  1  ) formed by two antiparallelly disposed tetracyano thienoquinoidal units has been synthesized and studied by electrochemistry, UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR, IR, EPR and transient spectroscopies.

         <title>Origin of the&#160;&#945;&#8208;Effect in SN2 Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The&#160;&#945;&#8208;effect is a term used to explain the dramatically enhanced reactivity of&#160;&#945;&#8208;nucleophiles (R&#8211;Y&#8211;X:&#8211;  ) compared to their parent normal nucleophile (R&#8211;X:&#8211;  ) by deviating from the classical Br&#248;nsted&#8208;type reactivity&#8211;basicity relationship. The exact origin of this effect is, however, still heavily under debate. In this work, we have quantum chemically analyzed the&#160;&#945;&#8208;effect of a set of anionic nucleophiles, including&#160;  O&#8208;,&#160;N&#8208; and&#160;S&#8208;based normal and&#160;&#945;&#8208;nucleophiles, participating in an SN2 reaction with&#160; ethyl chloride using relativistic density functional theory at ZORA&#8208;OLYP/QZ4P. Our activation strain and Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital analyses identified two criteria an&#160;&#945;&#8208;nucleophile needs to fulfill in order to show&#160;&#945;&#8208;effect: (i) a small HOMO lobe on the nucleophilic center, pointing towards the substrate, to reduce the repulsive occupied&#8211;occupied orbital overlap and hence (steric) Pauli repulsion with the substrate; and (ii) a sufficiently high energy HOMO to overcome the loss of favorable HOMO&#8211;LUMO orbital overlap with the substrate, as a consequence of the first criterion, by reducing the HOMO&#8211;LUMO orbital energy gap. If one of these two criteria is not fulfilled, one can expect no&#160;a&#8208;effect or inverse&#160;&#945;&#8208;effect. These principles will allow one to qualitatively predict if an&#160;&#945;&#8208;nucleophile possesses&#160;&#945;&#8208;effect solely based on the electronic structure of the&#160;&#945;&#8208;nucleophile and, therefore, have the potential to enable chemists to better understand these fundamental&#160;reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Photon Ionization Induced Stable White Organic Long Persistent Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic long persistent luminescence (OLPL) materials with afterglow duration in the scale of minutes or even hours are still rare. Most OLPL systems are based on exciplexes, which require complicated multi&#8208;component system in order to realize white afterglow with slightly compromised duration and color stability. In this work, OLPLs lasting from 20 to 40 minutes are realized with a simple binary system based on two&#8208;photon ionization mechanism, which can harvest simultaneously excitons from both singlet and triplet excited states, making it potentially the most promising candidate to achieve stable white OLPL. Through modulation and optimization of dopant structures in dibenzo[b,d]thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yldiphenyl phosphine oxide host, the emission profiles of afterglow can be readily tuned from cyan (0.19, 0.22), cold white (0.31, 0.35), standard white (0.33, 0.33) to warm white (0.31, 0.46), with excellent color consistency.</dc:description>

To prevent this dissociation, here, we introduce long&#8208;range intermolecular cation&#8208;&#960; interactions between A&#8208;site cations of hybrid perovskites. An aromatic diamine like 4,4&#8242;&#8208;trimethylenedipyridine, if protonated, can show a long&#8208;range cation&#8208;&#960; stacking, and therefore, serves as our A&#8208;site cation. Consequently, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;trimethylenedipyridinium lead bromide [(4,4&#8242;&#8208;TMDP)Pb  2  Br  6  ], a one&#8208;dimensional hybrid perovskite, remains completely stable after continuous water treatment for six months. Mechanistic insights about the cation&#8208;&#960; interactions are obtained by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The concept of long&#8208;range cation&#8208;&#960; interaction is further extended to another A&#8208;site cation 4,4&#8242;&#8208;ethylenedipyridinium ion (4,4&#8242;&#8208;EDP), forming water&#8208;stable (4,4&#8242;&#8208;EDP)Pb  2  Br  6  perovskite. These water&#8208;stable perovskites are then used to fabricate white light&#8208;emitting diode and for light up&#8208;conversion through tunable third&#8208;harmonic generation. Note that the achieved water stability is the intrinsic stability of perovskite composition, unlike the prior approach of encapsulating the unstable perovskite material (or device) by water&#8208;resistant materials. The introduced cation&#8208;&#960; interactions can be a breakthrough strategy in designing many more compositions of water&#8208;stable low&#8208;dimensional hybrid perovskites.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Observation of Metal Oxide Nanoparticles Being Transformed into Metal Single Atoms with Oxygen&#8208;Coordinated Structure and High&#8208;Loadings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unexpected oxygen&#8208;coordinated metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (Fe&#8208;, Co&#8208;, Ni&#8208;, Mn&#8208;SACs) with high loadings (above 10&#8197;wt&#8201;%) through direct transformation of metal oxide nanoparticles (Fe&#8208;, Co&#8208;, Ni&#8208;, Mn&#8208;NPs) in an inert atmosphere are directly observed.







Abstract
Direct conversion of bulk metal or nanoparticles into metal single atoms under thermal pyrolysis conditions is a highly efficient and promising strategy to fabricate single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). Usually, nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon is used as the anchoring substrate to capture the migrating metal ion species at high temperatures, and stable isolated SACs with nitrogen coordination are formed during the process. Herein, we report unexpected oxygen&#8208;coordinated metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (Fe&#8208;, Co&#8208;, Ni&#8208;, Mn&#8208;SACs) with high loadings (above 10&#8197;wt&#8201;%) through direct transformation of metal oxide nanoparticles (Fe&#8208;, Co&#8208;, Ni&#8208;, Mn&#8208;NPs) in an inert atmosphere at 750&#8201;&#176;C for 2&#8197;h. The atomic dispersion of metal single atoms and their coordinated structures were confirmed by aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption fine structures. In addition, the dynamic process of nanoparticles to atoms was directly observed by in&#8197;situ transmission electron microscopy. The as&#8208;prepared Fe SAC exhibited high activity and superior selectivity for catalytic oxidation of benzene to phenol with hydrogen peroxide.

         <title>Single Fluorinated Agent for Multiplexed 19F&#8208;MRI with Micromolar Detectability Based on Dynamic Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relying on principles of supramolecular chemistry, this manuscript describes the design, characterization, and implementation of a method for the generation of artificial (non&#8208;luminescent) colors for MRI applications. The proposed approach, which is termed GEST, exploits the reversible binding of inhalable biocompatible fluorinated agent to macrocycle hosts for micromolar detectability of host&#8211;guest complexes using background&#8208;free 19F&#8208;MRI.







Abstract
The weak thermal polarization of nuclear spins limits the sensitivity of MRI, even for MR&#8208;sensitive nuclei as fluorine&#8208;19. Therefore, despite being the source of inspiration for the development of background&#8208;free MRI for various applications, including for multiplexed imaging, the inability to map very low concentrations of targets using 19F&#8208;MRI raises the need to further enhance this platform's capabilities. Here, we employ the principles of CEST&#8208;MRI in 19F&#8208;MRI to obtain a 900&#8208;fold signal amplification of a biocompatible fluorinated agent, which can be presented in a &#8220;multicolor&#8221; fashion. Capitalizing on the dynamic interactions in host&#8211;guest supramolecular assemblies in an approach termed GEST, we demonstrate that an inhalable fluorinated anesthetic can be used as a single 19F&#8208;probe for the concurrent detection of micromolar levels of two targets, with potential in vivo translatability. Further extending GEST with new designs could expand the applicability of 19F&#8208;MRI to the mapping of targets that have so&#8208;far remained non&#8208;detectable.

         <title>Engineering Nanoparticulate Organic Photocatalysts via a Scalable Flash Nanoprecipitation Process for Efficient Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flash nanoprecipitation (FNP) method with rationally designed hydrophilic polymers to prepare nanoparticulate photocatalysts is presented. It is effective in addressing limitations of bulky particles and greatly improving the photocatalytic activity. This nanostructure engineering is promising for scale&#8208;up owing to the continuous operation of FNP, leading to potential practical applications of solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversions.







Abstract
Directly converting sunlight into hydrogen fuels using particulate photocatalysts represents a sustainable route for clean energy supply. Organic semiconductors have emerged as attractive candidates but always suffer from optical and exciton recombination losses with large exciton &#8220;dead zone&#8221; inside the bulk material, severely limiting the catalytic performance. Herein, we demonstrate a facile strategy that combines a scalable flash nanoprecipitation (FNP) method with hydrophilic soluble polymers (PC&#8208;PEG5 and PS&#8208;PEG5) to prepare highly efficient nanosized photocatalysts without using surfactants. Significantly, a 70&#8208;fold enhancement of hydrogen evolution rate (HER) is achieved for nanosized PC&#8208;PEG5, and the FNP&#8208;processed PS&#8208;PEG5 shows a peak HER rate of up to 37.2&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 under full&#8208;spectrum sunlight irradiation, which is among the highest results for polymer photocatalysts. A scaling&#8208;up production of nanocatalyst is demonstrated with the continuously operational FNP.

         <title>The Origin of Catalytic Benzylic C&#8722;H Oxidation over a Redox&#8208;Active Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidation of benzylic C&#8722;H groups in a broad range of substrates under mild conditions has been achieved using a robust metal&#8211;organic framework, MFM&#8208;170, incorporating redox&#8208;active [Cu2II(O2CR)4] paddlewheel nodes. EPR spectroscopy and synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction have identified the critical role of the paddlewheel moiety in activating the oxidant tBuOOH (tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide) via partial reduction to [CuIICuI(O2CR)4] species.







Abstract
Selective oxidation of benzylic C&#8722;H compounds to ketones is important for the production of a wide range of fine chemicals, and is often achieved using toxic or precious metal catalysts. Herein, we report the efficient oxidation of benzylic C&#8722;H groups in a broad range of substrates under mild conditions over a robust metal&#8211;organic framework material, MFM&#8208;170, incorporating redox&#8208;active [Cu2II(O2CR)4] paddlewheel nodes. A comprehensive investigation employing electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction has identified the critical role of the paddlewheel moiety in activating the oxidant tBuOOH (tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide) via partial reduction to [CuIICuI(O2CR)4] species.

         <title>Dynamic Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution of Tetrazines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A dynamic nucleophilic aromatic substitution of tetrazines (SNTz) is presented herein. It combines all the advantages of dynamic covalent chemistry with the versatility of the tetrazine moiety. Indeed, libraries of compounds or sophisticated molecular structures can be easily obtained, which are susceptible to post&#8208;functionalization by Inverse Electron Demand Diels&#8208;Alder (IEDDA) reaction, which also locks the exchange. Additionally, the structures obtained can be disassembled upon the application of the right stimulus, either UV&#8208;irradiation or a suitable chemical reagent. Moreover, SNTz is compatible with the imine chemistry of anilines. The high potential of this methodology has been proved by building two responsive supramolecular systems: A macrocycle that displays a light&#8208;induced release of acetylcholine; and a truncated [4+6] tetrahedral shape&#8208;persistent fluorescent cage which is disassembled by thiols unless it is post&#8208;stabilized by IEDDA.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioelectrocatalytic cofactor regeneration coupled to CO2 fixation in a redox&#8208;active hydrogel for stereoselective C&#8208;C bond formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sustainable capture and conversion of carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) is key to achieving a circular carbon economy. Bioelectrocatalysis, which aims at using renewable energies to power the highly specific, direct transformation of CO  2  into value added products holds promise to achieve this goal. However, the functional integration of CO  2  &#8208;fixing enzymes onto electrode materials for the electrosynthesis of stereochemically complex molecules remains to be demonstrated. Here, we show the electricity&#8208;driven regio&#8208; and stereoselective incorporation of CO  2  into crotonyl&#8208;CoA by an NADPH&#8208;dependent enzymatic reductive carboxylation. Co&#8208;Immobilization of a ferredoxin NADP  +  reductase and crotonyl&#8208;CoA carboxylase/reductase within a 2,2&#180;&#8208;viologen modified hydrogel enabled iterative NADPH recycling and stereoselective formation of (2  S  )&#8208;ethylmalonyl&#8208;CoA, a prospective intermediate towards multi&#8208;carbon products from CO  2  , with 92&#160;&#177;&#160;6&#160;% faradaic efficiency and at a rate of 1.6&#160;&#177;&#160;0.4&#160;&#181;mol&#160;cm  &#8208;2  &#160;h  &#8208;1  . This approach opens the way for realizing even more complex bioelectrocatalyic cascades in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling the Covalent Reactivity of a Kinase Inhibitor with Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent kinase inhibitors account for some of the most successful drugs that have recently entered the clinic and many others are in preclinical development. A common strategy is to target cysteines in the vicinity of the ATP binding site using an acrylamide electrophile. To increase the tissue selectivity of kinase inhibitors, it could be advantageous to control the reactivity of these electrophiles with light. Here, we introduce covalent inhibitors of the kinase JNK3 that function as photoswitchable affinity labels (PALs). Our lead compounds contain a diazocine photoswitch, are poor non&#8208;covalent inhibitors in the dark, and becomes effective covalent inhibitors after irradiation with visible light. Our proposed mode of action is supported by X&#8208;ray structures that explain why these compounds are unreactive in the dark and undergo proximity&#8208;based covalent attachment following exposure to light.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmable RNA N1&#8208;Methyladenosine Demethylation by a Cas13d&#8208;Directed Demethylase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N  1  &#8208;methyladenosine (m  1  A) is a prevalent and reversible RNA modification, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of RNA fate and gene expression. However, the lack of tools to precisely manipulate m  1  A sites in specific transcripts has hindered efforts to  clarify the association between a specific m  1  A&#8208;modified transcript and its phenotypic outcomes.  Here we develop a CRISPR&#8208;Cas13d&#8208;based tool called  re  engineered m  1  A  mo  dification  v  alid  er  aser (termed &#8220;REMOVER&#8221;) for targeted m  1  A demethylation of a specific transcript. The catalytically inactive RfxCas13d (dCasRx) is fused to the m  1  A demethylase ALKBH3, and the dCasRx&#8208;ALKBH3 fusion protein can mediate potent demethylation of m  1  A&#8208;modified RNAs. We further find that REMOVER can specifically demethylate m  1  A of MALAT1 and PRUNE1 RNAs, thereby significantly increasing their stability. Our study establishes REMOVER as a tool for targeted RNA demethylation of specific m  1  A&#8208;modified transcripts, which enables further elucidation of the relationship between m  1  A modification of specific transcripts and their phenotypic outcomes.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatial order of functional modules enabling diverse intracellular performance of fluorescent probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To overcome a series of challenges in tumor therapy, modular&#8208;agent probes (MAPs) comprised of various functional modules have been proposed. Nowadays, researchers have tried to optimize the MAPs by exploiting the new modules or increasing the numbers of module, while neglecting the configuration of various modules. Here, we focus on the different spatial&#8208;arrangements of existing modules. By utilizing a tetraphenylethylene (TPE) derivative with stereochemical structure and dual modifiable end&#8208;group sites as small molecule scaffold, two MAPs with same modular agents (module T for enhancing the internalization of MAPs by tumor cells and module M for causing mitochondrial dysfunction) but different spatial&#8208;arrangements (on the one side, TM&#8208;AIE, and two sides, T&#8208;AIE&#8208;M, of the molecule scaffold) are designed. It was found that T&#8208;AIE&#8208;M with bigger RGD binding angle performed higher specificity, while TM&#8208;AIE characterizing longer &#945;&#8208;helix structure displayed superior toxicity. This interesting phenomenon sheds light on the design concept of future MAPs and opens a window for the renaissance of existing MAPs by rearranging modules.</dc:description>

         <title>Halide Replacement with Complete Preservation of Crystal Lattice in Mixed&#8208;Anion Lanthanide Oxyhalides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topochemical halide ion replacement in lanthanide oxyiodide nanostructures proceeds with complete preservation of the tetragonal matlockite crystal structure along a gradient of increasing anion hardness. Reformation of the anion lattice around the intact cation slabs impedes 5D3&#8208;5D4 phonon&#8208;assisted cross relaxation and is observed as a distinctive blue hue for an embedded quantum reporter.







Abstract
A challenge in anion control in periodic solids is to preserve the crystal lattice while substituting for different anions of widely varying size and hardness. Post&#8208;synthetic modification routes that place cations or anions in non&#8208;equilibrium configurations are promising; however, such methods remain relatively unexplored for anion placement. Here, we report the synthesis of LaOI nanocrystals by a non&#8208;hydrolytic sol&#8208;gel condensation reaction and their transformation into LaOBr, LaOCl, and LaOF nanocrystals along hard&#8211;soft acid&#8211;base principles using post&#8208;synthetic metathesis reactions with ammonium halides. Anion displacement proceeds along halide planes, preserving the tetragonal matlockite structure. Energy&#8208;variant X&#8208;ray excited optical luminesce signatures of alloyed Tb3+&#8208;ions is a sensitive quantum reporter of the preservation of the cation sublattice and hardening of the crystal structure upon anion replacement.

         <title>Highly Efficient Electrofluorescence Material Based on Pure Organic Phosphor Sensitization**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of electroluminescence films based on a purely organic phosphor sensitizing fluorescence emitter were developed. A series of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP)&#8208;sensitized fluorescent materials with the capacity to break the limitation of 25&#8201;% internal quantum efficiency (IQE) for normal electrofluorescence devices was constructed.







Abstract
Pure organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials are considered as potential candidates for replacing precious metal complexes to fabricate highly efficient organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs). However, applications of the reported RTP materials in OLEDs are seriously impeded by their low photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) in a thin film state. To overcome these obstacles, we established a new strategy to construct highly efficient OLEDs based on a pure organic RTP material sensitized fluorescence emitter by selecting benzimidazole&#8208;triazine molecules (PIM&#8208;TRZ), 2,6&#8208;di(phenothiazinyl)naphthalene (&#946;&#8208;DPTZN), and 5,6,11,12&#8208;tetraphenylnaphthacene (rubrene) as host, phosphor sensitizer, and fluorescent emitter, respectively. The perfect combination of host, phosphorescent sensitizer, and fluorescent emitter in the emitting layer ensure the outstanding performance of the devices with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 15.7&#8201;%.

         <title>Enhancing anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 Immunotherapy by Nanomicelles Self&#8208;Assembled from Multivalent Aptamer Drug Conjugates</title>

         <dc:description>
We describe a tumor&#8208;targeting yet enhanced chemotherapy, which is enabled by nanomicelles self&#8208;assembled from multivalent aptamer drug conjugates. Co&#8208;self&#8208;assembly with a multivalent PEG&#8208;conjugated drug analogue reaches an optimal complementation between the blood circulation and tumor&#8208;targeting ability of the nanomicelles, which augments the antitumor immune responses of the checkpoint blockade.







Abstract
A tumor&#8208;targeting enhanced chemotherapy, enabled by aptamer&#8208;drug conjugate nanomicelles, is reported that boosts antitumor immune responses. Multivalent aptamer drug conjugate (ApMDC), an amphiphilic telodendrimer consisting of a hydrophilic aptamer and a hydrophobic monodendron anchored with four anticancer drugs by acid&#8208;labile linkers, was designed and synthesized. By co&#8208;self&#8208;assembly with an ApMDC analogue, in which aptamer is replaced with polyethylene glycol, the surface aptamer density of these nanomicelles can be screened to reach an optimal complementation between blood circulation and tumor&#8208;targeting ability. Optimized nanomicelles can enhance immunogenic cell death of tumor cells, which strikingly augments the tumor&#8208;specific immune responses of the checkpoint blockade in immunocompetent tumor&#8208;bearing mice. ApMDC nanomicelles represent a robust platform for structure&#8211;function optimization of drug conjugates and nanomedicines.

         <title>Deracemization of Carbohelicenes by a Chiral Perylene Bisimide Cyclophane Template Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inherently chiral perylene bisimide cyclophane has been synthesized that shows high binding affinities for carbohelicene guests in organic solvents. The perfect shape complementarity of the host&#8211;guest system was utilized for the deracemization of conformationally labile [4]&#8208; and [5]&#8208;helicenes.







Abstract
Deracemization describes the conversion of a racemic mixture of a chiral molecule into an enantioenriched mixture or an enantiopure compound without structural modifications. Herein, we report an inherently chiral perylene bisimide (PBI) cyclophane whose chiral pocket is capable of transforming a racemic mixture of [5]&#8208;helicene into an enantioenriched mixture with an enantiomeric excess of 66&#8201;%. UV/Vis and fluorescence titration studies reveal this cyclophane host composed of two helically twisted PBI dyes has high binding affinities for the respective homochiral carbohelicene guests, with outstanding binding constants of up to 3.9&#215;1010&#8197;m&#8722;1 for [4]&#8208;helicene. 2D NMR studies and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis demonstrate that the observed strong and enantioselective binding of homochiral carbohelicenes and the successful template&#8208;catalyzed deracemization of [5]&#8208;helicene can be explained by the enzyme&#8208;like perfect shape complementarity of the macrocyclic supramolecular host.

         <title>A Modular In&#8197;Vitro Platform for the Production of Terpenes and Polyketides from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coupling of a synthetic CO2&#8208;fixing cycle and a natural glyoxylate assimilation cycle with different biosynthetic pathways enables the sustainable production of terpenes and polyketides. Demonstration of this modular, multi&#8208;enzyme in&#8197;vitro platform sets the stage for a diversified synthesis of pharmaceuticals and commodity chemicals directly from CO2.







Abstract
A long&#8208;term goal in realizing a sustainable biocatalysis and organic synthesis is the direct use of the greenhouse gas CO2 as feedstock for the production of bulk and fine chemicals, such as pharmaceuticals, fragrances and food additives. Here we developed a modular in&#8197;vitro platform for the continuous conversion of CO2 into complex multi&#8208;carbon compounds, such as monoterpenes (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15) and polyketides. Combining natural and synthetic metabolic pathway modules, we established a route from CO2 into the key intermediates acetyl&#8208; and malonyl&#8208;CoA, which can be subsequently diversified through the action of different terpene and polyketide synthases. Our proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study demonstrates the simultaneous operation of different metabolic modules comprising of up to 29&#8197;enzymes in one pot, which paves the way for developing and optimizing synthesis routes for the generation of complex CO2&#8208;based chemicals in the future.

         <dc:description>Molecular doping is an of significance approach to reduce defects density of perovskite and to improve interfacial charge extraction in perovskite solar cells. Here, we show a new strategy for chemical doping of perovskite via an organic small molecule, which features a fused tricyclic core, showing strong intermolecular &#960;&#8208;Pb  2+  interactions with under&#8208;coordinated Pb  2+  in perovskite. This &#960;&#8208;Pb  2+  interactions could reduce defects density of the perovskite and suppress the nonradiative recombination, which was also confirmed by the density functional theory calculations. In addition, this doping via &#960;&#8208;Pb  2+  interactions could deepen the surface potential and downshift the work function of the doped perovskite film, facilitating the hole extraction to hole transport layer. As a result, the doped device showed excellent efficiency of 21.41% with ignorable hysteresis. This strategy of fused tricyclic core&#8208;based doping provides a new perspective for the design of new organic materials to improve the device performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Diethynyl Phosphinates for Cysteine&#8208;Selective Protein Labeling and Disulfide Rebridging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diethynyl phosphonites were found to react specifically with two thiols in aqueous buffer to give constructs that are stable under physiological conditions. This enables the facile generation of protein (double)&#8208;conjugates. Moreover, these molecules can be used to rebridge the interchain disulfides of therapeutic IgG antibodies.







Abstract
Diethynyl phosphinates were developed as bisfunctional electrophiles for the site&#8208;selective modification of peptides, proteins and antibodies. One of their electron&#8208;deficient triple bonds reacts selectively with a thiol and positions an electrophilic moiety for a subsequent intra&#8208; or intermolecular reaction with another thiol. The obtained conjugates were found to be stable in human plasma and in the presence of small thiols. We further demonstrate that this method is suitable for the generation of functional protein conjugates for intracellular delivery. Finally, this reagent class was used to generate functional homogeneously rebridged antibodies that remain specific for their target. Their modular synthesis, thiol selectivity and conjugate stability make diethynyl phosphinates ideal candidates for protein conjugation for biological and pharmaceutical applications.

This enables the facile generation of protein (double)-conjugates. Moreover, these molecules can be used to rebridge the interchain disulfides of therapeutic IgG antibodies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diethynyl phosphinates were developed as bisfunctional electrophiles for the site-selective modification of peptides, proteins and antibodies. One of their electron-deficient triple bonds reacts selectively with a thiol and positions an electrophilic moiety for a subsequent intra- or intermolecular reaction with another thiol. The obtained conjugates were found to be stable in human plasma and in the presence of small thiols. We further demonstrate that this method is suitable for the generation of functional protein conjugates for intracellular delivery. Finally, this reagent class was used to generate functional homogeneously rebridged antibodies that remain specific for their target. Their modular synthesis, thiol selectivity and conjugate stability make diethynyl phosphinates ideal candidates for protein conjugation for biological and pharmaceutical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <dc:description>2D metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) film as active layer show promising application prospects in various fields including the sensors, catalysis, and electronic device. However, exploring the application of 2D MOF film in the field of artificial synapses has not been implemented yet. In this work, we fabricated one kind of novel monolayer MOF film (Cu&#8211;THPP, THPP = 5,10,15,20&#8208;Tetrakis(4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)&#8208;21H,23H&#8208;porphine), and further used it as an active layer to explore the application in the simulation of human brain synapses. It shows excellent light&#8208;stimulated synaptic plasticity properties, and exhibits the foundation function of synapses such as long&#8208;term plasticity (LTP), short&#8208;term plasticity (STP), and the conversion of STP to LTP. Most critically, the MOF based artificial synaptic device exhibit an excellent stability in atmosphere. This work opens the door for the application of MOF film in the simulation of human brain synapses.</dc:description>

         <title>A Direct Organocatalytic Enantioselective Route to Functionalized trans&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder Products Having the Norcarane Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An enantioselective methodology to construct trans&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder scaffolds by organocatalysis with excellent selectivity, high yield and up to five contiguous stereocenters is presented. The reaction concept integrates the halogen effect and a novel discovered pseudo&#8208;halogen effect to direct an endo&#8208;selective, secondary&#8208;amine catalyzed Diels&#8208;Alder reaction allowing for the subsequent formation of trans&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder cycloadducts featuring the norcarene scaffold. The methodology relies on the reaction between an in situ generated trienamine and an &#945;&#8208;brominated or &#945;&#8208;pseudo&#8208;halogenated enone to form a fleeting cis&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder intermediate. The endo&#8208;transition state&#8212;enhanced by the (pseudo&#8208;)halogen effect&#8212;sets the stereochemistry that allows for a subsequent SN2&#8208;like reaction at a tertiary center to obtain the trans&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder scaffold. The mechanism was investigated and supported by experimental results as well as computational studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Precisely Engineered Supported Gold Clusters as a Stable Catalyst for Propylene Epoxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing a stable and selective catalyst with high H  2  utilisation is of pivotal importance for the direct gas&#8208;phase epoxidation of propylene. This work describes a facile one&#8208;pot methodology to synthesise ligand&#8208;stabilised sub&#8208;nanometre gold clusters immobilised onto a zeolitic support (TS&#8208;1) to engineer a stable Au/TS&#8208;1 catalyst. A non&#8208;thermal O  2  plasma technique is used for the quick removal of ligands with limited increase in particle size. Compared to untreated Au/TS&#8208;1 catalysts prepared using the deposition precipitation method, the synthesised catalyst exhibits improved catalytic performance, including 10 times longer lifetime (&gt;20 days), increased PO selectivity and hydrogen efficiency in direct gas phase epoxidation. The structure&#8208;stability relationship of the catalyst is illustrated using multiple characterisation techniques, such as XPS,  31  P MAS NMR, DR&#8208;UV/VIS, HRTEM and TGA. It is hypothesised that the ligands play a guardian role in stabilising the Au particle size, which is vital in this reaction. This strategy is a promising approach towards designing a more stable and reproducible heterogeneous catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Bispericyclic Diels&#8211;Alder Dimerization of ortho&#8208;Quinols in Natural Product (Bio)Synthesis: Bioinspired Chemical 6&#8208;Step Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Maytenone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biosynthesis of many natural bicyclo[2.2.2]octenone products involves the Diels&#8211;Alder cyclodimerization of ortho&#8208;quinols according to the same selectivity rules. This is illustrated by the enzyme&#8208;free synthesis of the bisditerpenoid (+)&#8208;maytenone, first achieved by a chiral iodane&#8208;mediated dearomative hydroxylation of (+)&#8208;ferruginol and a high pressure&#8208;promoted Diels&#8211;Alder reaction.







Abstract
Many natural products of plant or microbial origins are derived from enzymatic dearomative oxygenation of 2&#8208;alkylphenolic precursors into 6&#8208;alkyl&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxycyclohexa&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienones. These so&#8208;called ortho&#8208;quinols cyclodimerize via a remarkably selective bispericyclic Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. Whether or not the intervention of catalytic or dirigent proteins is involved during this final step of the biosynthesis of these natural products, this cyclodimerization of ortho&#8208;quinols can be chemically reproduced in the laboratory with the same strict level of site&#8208;specific regioselectivity and stereoselectivity. This unique yet unified process, which finds its rationale in the inherent chemical reactivity of those ortho&#8208;quinols, is illustrated herein by an efficient and bioinspired first chemical synthesis of one of the most structurally complex and synthetically challenging examples of such natural cyclodimers, the bisditerpenoid (+)&#8208;maytenone.

         <title>Cycloaddition Cascades of Strained Alkynes and Oxadiazinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a computational and experimental study of the reaction of oxadiazinones and strained alkynes to give polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The reaction proceeds by way of a pericyclic reaction cascade and leads to the formation of four new carbon&#8211;carbon bonds. Using M06&#8208;2X DFT calculations, we interrogate several mechanistic aspects of the reaction, such as why the use of non&#8208;aromatic strained alkynes can be used to access unsymmetrical PAHs, whereas the use of arynes in the methodology leads to symmetrical PAHs. In addition, experimental studies enable the rapid synthesis of new PAHs, including tetracene and pentacene scaffolds. These studies not only provide fundamental insight regarding the aforementioned cycloaddition cascades and synthetic access to PAH scaffolds, but are also expected to enable the synthesis of new materials.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We report a computational and experimental study of the reaction of oxadiazinones and strained alkynes to give polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The reaction proceeds by way of a pericyclic reaction cascade and leads to the formation of four new carbon&#8211;carbon bonds. Using M06-2X DFT calculations, we interrogate several mechanistic aspects of the reaction, such as why the use of non-aromatic strained alkynes can be used to access unsymmetrical PAHs, whereas the use of arynes in the methodology leads to symmetrical PAHs. In addition, experimental studies enable the rapid synthesis of new PAHs, including tetracene and pentacene scaffolds. These studies not only provide fundamental insight regarding the aforementioned cycloaddition cascades and synthetic access to PAH scaffolds, but are also expected to enable the synthesis of new materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Decarboxylation Coupling Facilitated by Lock&#8208;to&#8208;Unlock Variation of Molecules upon the Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>On&#8208;surface synthesis (OSS) involving relatively high energy barriers remains challenging due to a typical dilemma: firm molecular anchor is required to prevent molecular desorption upon the reaction, whereas sufficient lateral mobility is crucial for subsequent coupling and assembly. By locking the molecular precursors on the substrate then unlocking them during the reaction, we present a strategy to address this challenge. High&#8208;yield synthesis based on well&#8208;defined decarboxylation, intermediate transition and hexamerization is demonstrated, resulting in an extended and ordered network exclusively composed of the newly&#8208;synthesized macrocyclic compound. Thanks to the steric hindrance of its maleimide group, we attain a preferential selection of the coupling. This work unlocks a promising path to enrich the reaction types and improve the coupling selectivity hence the structual homogeneity of the final product for OSS.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface engineering and controlled ripening for seed&#8208;mediated growth of Au islands on Au nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineering the nucleation and growth of plasmonic metals (Ag and Au) on their pre&#8208;existing seeds is expected to produce nanostructures with unconventional morphologies and plasmonic properties that may find unique applications in sensing, catalysis, and broadband energy harvesting. Typical seed&#8208;mediated growth processes take advantage of the perfect lattice match between the deposited metal and seeds to induce conformal coating, leading to either simple size increases (e.g., Au on Au) or the formation of core&#8208;shell structures (e.g., Ag on Au) with limited morphology change. In this work, we show that the introduction of a thin layer of metal with considerable lattice mismatch can effectively induce the nucleation of well&#8208;defined Au islands on Au nanocrystal seeds. By controlling the interfacial energy between the seed and the deposited material, the oxidative ripening, and the surface diffusion of metal precursors, we can regulate the number of islands on the seeds and produce complex Au nanostructures with morphologies tunable from core&#8208;satellites to tetramers, trimers, and dimers. This surface engineering strategy is of great significance in nanomaterial synthesis as it is general and can be used to create secondary structures of many other nanocrystals in a controllable manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;mediated Ambient electrolytic Nitrogen Reduction for Hydrazine and Ammonia Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ambient electrolytic nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) is extensively studied as a potential alternative to the capital and energy intensive Habor&#8208;Bosch process for ammonia production. Most lab&#8208;based eNRRs are performed with catalyst directly loaded on the electrode surface, with which the catalyst loading, gas flow and current density are constrained leading to a low rate of production. Herein, we present a redox&#8208;mediated electrolytic nitrogen reduction reaction (RM&#8208;eNRR) using polyoxometalate (POM) as the electron and proton carrier which frees the Fe&#8208;TiO  2  catalyst from the electrode and shifts the reduction of nitrogen to a reactor tank. The RM&#8208;eNRR process has achieved an ammonium production yield of 25.1 &#956;g h  &#8208;1  or 5.0 &#956;g h  &#8208;1  cm  &#8208;2  at an ammonium concentration of 6.7 ppm. With excess catalyst, 61.0 ppm ammonium was accumulated in the electrolyte upon continuous operation, which is the highest concentration detected for ambient eNRR so far. The mechanism underlying the RM&#8208;eNRR was scrutinized both experimentally and computationally to delineate the POM&#8208;mediated charge transfer and hydrogenation process of nitrogen molecule on the catalyst. RM&#8208;eNRR is expected to provide an implementable solution to overcome the limitations in the conventional eNRR process.</dc:description>

         <title>Ambient hydrogenation and deuteration of alkenes using a nano&#8208;structured Ni&#8208;core&#8208;shell catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A general protocol for the selective hydrogenation and deuteration of a variety of alkenes is presented. Key to success for these reactions is the use of a specific nickel&#8208;graphitic shell&#8208;based core&#8208;shell structured catalyst, which is conveniently prepared by impregnation and subsequent calcination of nickel nitrate on carbon at 450 oC under argon. Applying this nano&#8208;structured catalyst, both terminal and internal alkenes, which are of industrial and commercial importance, were selectively hydrogenated and deuterated at ambient conditions (room temperature using 1 bar hydrogen or 1 bar deuterium), giving access to the corresponding alkanes and deuterium&#8208;labelled alkanes in good to excellent yields. The synthetic utility and practicability of this Ni&#8208;based hydrogenation protocol is demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale reactions as well as efficient catalyst recycling experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvated Nickel Complexes as Stoichiometric and Catalytic Perfluoroalkylation Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The acetonitrile&#8208;solvated [(MeCN)Ni(C2F5)3]&#8722;  was prepared in order to compare and contrast its reactivity with the known [(MeCN)Ni(CF3)3]&#8722;  towards organic electrophiles. Both [(MeCN)Ni(CF3)3]&#8722;  and [(MeCN)Ni(C2F5)3]&#8722;  successfully react with aryl iodonium and diazonium salts as well as alkynyl iodonium salts to give fluoroalkylated organic products. Electrochemical analysis of [(MeCN)NiII(C2F5)3]&#8722;  suggests that, upon electro&#8208;oxidation to [(MeCN)nNiIII(C2F5)3], reductive homolysis of a perfluoroethyl radical occurs, with the concomitant formation of [(MeCN)NiII(C2F5)2]. Catalytic C&#8208;H trifluoromethylations of electron rich arenes were successfully achieved using either [(MeCN)Ni(CF3)3]&#8722;  or the related [Ni(CF3)4]2&#8211;  . Stoichiometric reactions of the solvated nickel complexes reveal that &#8220;ligandless&#8221; nickel is exceptionally capable of serving as reservoir of CF3  anions or radicals under catalytically relevant conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulation of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence to Room Temperature Phosphorescent Emission Channels by Controlling the Excited&#8208;States Dynamics via J&#8208; and H&#8208;Aggregation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling of excited&#8208;state dynamics plays a central role in tuning room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emissions, but remaining challenging in the exploration of organic luminescent materials (OLMs). Herein, we demonstrated the regulation of TADF and RTP emissions of a boron difluoride &#946;&#8208; acetylnaphthalene chelate (  &#946;  CBF  2  ) by controlling the excited&#8208;state dynamics via its J&#8208; and H&#8208;aggregation states. Two crystalline polymorphs emitting green and red light have been controllably obtained. Although both belong to the monoclinic system, the green and red crystals are dominated by J&#8208; and H&#8208;aggregation respectively, due to different molecular packing arrangements. Experimental and theoretical studies show that J&#8208;aggregation not only significantly reduces the energy gap between the lowest singlet and triplet excited states for the realization of ultra&#8208;fast reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process, but also enhances the radiative decay of singlet, together leading to TADF. The H&#8208;aggregation accelerates the ISC and meanwhile suppresses the radiative decay of singlet, helping to stabilize the triplet exciton for RTP. These results deepen the understanding of the effect of aggregation on the luminescence mechanism of organic solids, and provide new strategy to tuning TADF and RTP OLMs.</dc:description>

         <title>An Alkyne Metathesis Based Approach to the Synthesis of the Anti&#8208;malarial Macrodiolide Samroiyotmycin A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the first total synthesis of samroiyotmycin A (1), a C2&#8208;symmetric 20&#8208;membered anti&#8208;malarial macrodiolide isolated from Streptomyces sp. The convergent synthetic strategy orchestrates bisalkyne fragment&#8208;assembly using an unprecedented Sch&#1255;llkopf&#8208;type condensation on a substituted &#946;&#8208;lactone and an ambitious late&#8208;stage one&#8208;pot alkyne cross metathesis &#8211; ring&#8208;closing metathesis (ACM&#8208;RCAM) reaction. The demanding alkyne metathesis sequence is achieved using the latest generation of molybdenum alkylidynes endowed with a tripodal silanolate ligand framework. Subsequent conversion to the required E&#8208;alkenes uses contemporary hydrometallation chemistry catalysed by tetrameric cluster [{Cp*RuCl}4].</dc:description>

         <title>Heterogeneously&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidation of methane to a methyl derivative</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A promising strategy to break through the selectivity&#8208;conversion limit of direct methane conversion to achieve high yields is the protection of methanol via esterification to a more stable methyl ester. In this study, we present a novel aerobic methane&#8208;to&#8208;methyl&#8208;ester approach that utilizes a highly dispersed, cobalt&#8208;containing solid catalyst, along with significantly more favorable reaction conditions compared to existing homogeneously&#8208;catalyzed approaches (e.g. diluted acid, O  2  oxidant, moderate temperature and pressure). The trifluoroacetic acid medium is diluted (&lt; 25 wt%) with an inert fluorous co&#8208;solvent that can be recovered after the separation of the methyl trifluoroacetate via liquid&#8208;liquid extraction at ambient conditions. Silica&#8208;supported cobalt catalysts are highly active in this system, with competitive yields and turnovers in comparison to known aerobic transition metal&#8208;based catalytic systems. This work highlights the need and potential to reinvigorate the development of methane conversion technologies through the innovative application and combination of concepts from across the community.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative Bond Activation and Facile Intramolecular Aryl Transfer of Nickel&#8211;Aluminum Pincer&#8208;type Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel complexes supported by a pincer&#8208;type aluminum metalloligand were synthesized and demonstrated several unique modes of metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity. Unexpectedly, the PAlP framework reversibly converts between the alane and alumniyl through aryl group transmetalation between aluminum and nickel.







Abstract
Pincer&#8208;type nickel&#8211;aluminum complexes were synthesized using two equivalents of the phosphinoamide, [PhNCH2PiPr2]&#8722;. The Ni0&#8211;AlIII complexes, {(MesPAlP)Ni}2(&#956;&#8208;N2) and {(MesPAlP)Ni}2(&#956;&#8208;COD), where MesPAlP is (Mes)Al(NPhCH2PiPr2)2, were structurally characterized. The (PAlP)Ni system exhibited cooperative bond cleavage mediated by the two&#8208;site Ni&#8211;Al unit, including oxidative addition of aryl halides, H2 activation, and ortho&#8208;directed C&#8722;H bond activation of pyridine N&#8208;oxide. One intriguing reaction is the reversible intramolecular transfer of the mesityl ring from the Al to the Ni site, which is evocative of the transmetalation step during cross&#8208;coupling catalysis. The aryl&#8208;transfer product,(THF)Al(NPhCH2PiPr2)2Ni(Mes), is the first example of a first&#8208;row transition metal&#8211;aluminyl pincer complex. The addition of a judicious donor enables the Al metalloligand to convert reversibly between the alane and aluminyl forms via aryl group transfer to and from Ni, respectively. Theoretical calculations support a zwitterionic Ni&#948;&#8722;&#8211;Al&#948;+ electronic structure in the nickel&#8211;aluminyl complex.

         <title>Expedient Dual Co/Organophotoredox Catalyzed Stereoselective Synthesis of All&#8208;Carbon Quaternary Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co/organophotoredox dual catalysis allows the stereocontrolled synthesis of 1,3&#8208;diol products featuring quaternary carbon centers using vinyl cyclic carbonates and aldehydes as reaction partners. This streamlined method offers a wide scope of syn&#8208;configured products obtained under mild operating conditions, and control reactions suggest that diastereocontrol is exerted within a Zimmerman&#8211;Traxler type transition state.







Abstract
An efficient and attractive Co/organophotoredox dual catalysis protocol has been developed allowing the stereoselective access to a wide variety of syn&#8208;configured 1,3&#8208;diols featuring quaternary carbon centers. The synthesis of the target molecules is achieved under ambient reaction conditions using modular and accessible reagents, substituted vinyl cyclic carbonates and aldehydes, and in short reaction times. Mechanistic control experiments suggest that the stereoselectivity can be rationalized via a preferred Zimmerman&#8211;Traxler transition state comprising a Co(allyl) species and an activated aldehyde. This newly developed process thus expands the use of base metal catalysis in the construction of challenging quaternary carbon stereocenters.

         <title>Probing Interfacial Electronic Effects on Single&#8208;Molecule Adsorption Geometry and Electron Transport at Atomically Flat Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
STM breaking junction and shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy techniques have been successfully applied to probe a solvent modification induced interfacial electronic effect on tuning contact geometries and electron transport of pyridyl molecules at atomically flat Au (111). Modulation of binding geometry from vertical to tilted and flat is observed and a 316&#8201;% modulation of single&#8208;molecule conductance is achieved.







Abstract
Clarifying interfacial electronic effects on molecular adsorption is significant in many chemical and biochemical processes. Here, we used STM breaking junction and shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy to probe electron transport and adsorption geometries of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (4,4&#8242;&#8208;BPY) at Au(111). Modifying the surface with 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium cation&#8208;containing ionic liquids (ILs) decreases surface electron density and stabilizes a vertical orientation of pyridine through nitrogen atom &#963;&#8208;bond interactions, resulting in uniform adsorption configurations for forming molecular junctions. Modulation from vertical, tilted, to flat, is achieved on adding water to ILs, leading to a new peak ascribed to CC stretching of adsorbed pyridyl ring and 316&#8201;% modulation of single&#8208;molecule conductance. The dihedral angle between adsorbed pyridyl ring and surface decreases with increasing surface electronic density, enhancing electron donation from surface to pyridyl ring.

         <title>Diversity&#8208;Oriented Synthesis of Aliphatic Fluorides via Reductive C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) Cross&#8208;Coupling Fluoroalkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct nickel&#8208;catalyzed monofluoroalkylation of unactivated alkyl halides has been established, by demonstrating the first example of reductive C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) cross&#8208;coupling fluoroalkylation. These transformations exhibited high efficiency, mild conditions, and excellent functional&#8208;group compatibility, especially for a range of pharmaceuticals and biologically active compounds.







Abstract
Monofluorinated alkyl compounds are of great importance in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and materials. Herein, we describe a direct nickel&#8208;catalyzed monofluoromethylation of unactivated alkyl halides using a low&#8208;cost industrial raw material, bromofluoromethane, by demonstrating a general and efficient reductive cross&#8208;coupling of two alkyl halides. Results with 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;fluoroalkane also demonstrate the viability of monofluoroalkylation, which further established the first example of reductive C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp3) cross&#8208;coupling fluoroalkylation. These transformations demonstrate high efficiency, mild conditions, and excellent functional&#8208;group compatibility, especially for a range of pharmaceuticals and biologically active compounds. Mechanistic studies support a radical pathway. Kinetic studies reveal that the reaction is first&#8208;order dependent on catalyst and alkyl bromide whereas the generation of monofluoroalkyl radical is not involved in the rate&#8208;determining step. This strategy provides a general and efficient method for the synthesis of aliphatic fluorides.

     alt="Diversity-Oriented Synthesis of Aliphatic Fluorides via Reductive C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) Cross-Coupling Fluoroalkylation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A direct nickel-catalyzed monofluoroalkylation of unactivated alkyl halides has been established, by demonstrating the first example of reductive C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) cross-coupling fluoroalkylation. These transformations exhibited high efficiency, mild conditions, and excellent functional-group compatibility, especially for a range of pharmaceuticals and biologically active compounds.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monofluorinated alkyl compounds are of great importance in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and materials. Herein, we describe a direct nickel-catalyzed monofluoromethylation of unactivated alkyl halides using a low-cost industrial raw material, bromofluoromethane, by demonstrating a general and efficient reductive cross-coupling of two alkyl halides. Results with 1-bromo-1-fluoroalkane also demonstrate the viability of monofluoroalkylation, which further established the first example of reductive C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)-C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) cross-coupling fluoroalkylation. These transformations demonstrate high efficiency, mild conditions, and excellent functional-group compatibility, especially for a range of pharmaceuticals and biologically active compounds. Mechanistic studies support a radical pathway. Kinetic studies reveal that the reaction is first-order dependent on catalyst and alkyl bromide whereas the generation of monofluoroalkyl radical is not involved in the rate-determining step. This strategy provides a general and efficient method for the synthesis of aliphatic fluorides.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Selectivity and Targeting of G&#8208;Quadruplex Binders Activated by Adaptive Binding and Controlled by Chemical Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A PtII compound was synthesized and adaptively bound G&#8208;quadruplex DNA through kinetic control. The solution structure of the complex was solved. It was further proved that the compound can target G&#8208;quadruplex in living cells, repress VEGF expression in cancer cells and inhibit blood vessels growth in zebrafish.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) are prevalent in oncogenes and are potential antitumor drug targets. However, binding selectivity of compounds to G4s still faces challenges. Herein, we report a platinum(II) complex (Pt1), whose affinity to G4&#8208;DNA is activated by adaptive binding and selectivity controlled by binding kinetics. The resolved structure of Pt1/VEGF&#8208;G4 (a promoter G4) shows that Pt1 matches 3&#8242;&#8208;G&#8208;tetrad of VEGF&#8208;G4 through Cl&#8722;&#8208;dissociation and loop rearrangement of VEGF&#8208;G4. Binding rate constants are determined by coordination bond breakage/formation, correlating fully with affinities. The selective rate&#8208;determining binding step, Cl&#8722;&#8208;dissociation upon G4&#8208;binding, is 2&#8211;3 orders of magnitude higher than dsDNA. Pt1 potently targets G4 in living cells, effectively represses VEGF expression, and inhibits vascular growth in zebrafish. We show adaptive G4&#8208;binding activation and controlled by kinetics, providing a complementary design principle for compounds targeting G4 or similar biomolecules.

         <title>Programming Fluorogenic DNA Probes for Rapid Detection of Steroids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aptamers based on forced intercalation (FIT) were developed to detect steroids such as dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate in clinical human serum samples. These FIT&#8208;aptamers offer several advantages over gold standard methods, including rapid readout (&lt;30&#8197;min), simple instrumentation (plate&#8208;reader), and low sample volumes (10&#8197;&#956;L).







Abstract
The ability of aptamers to recognize a variety of different molecules has fueled their emergence as recognition agents to probe complex media and cells. Many detection strategies require aptamer binding to its target to result in a dramatic change in structure, typically from an unfolded to a folded state. Here, we report a strategy based on forced intercalation (FIT) that increases the scope of aptamer recognition by transducing subtle changes in aptamer structures into fluorescent readouts. By screening a library of green&#8208;fluorescent FIT&#8208;aptamers whose design is guided by computational modeling, we could identify hits that sense steroids like dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) down to 1.3&#8197;&#956;M with no loss in binding affinity compared to the unmodified aptamer. This enabled us to study DHEAS in clinical serum samples with several advantages over gold standard methods, including rapid readout (&lt;30&#8197;min), simple instrumentation (plate&#8208;reader), and low sample volumes (10&#8197;&#956;L).

         <title>Rhenium&#8208;Catalyzed Arylation&#8211;Acyl Cyclization between Enol Lactones and Organomagnesium Halides: Facile Synthesis of Indenones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A range of functionalized organomagnesium halides and enol lactones underwent rhenium&#8208;catalyzed sequential arylation&#8211;acyl cyclization under mild reaction conditions, thus providing an expedient route to polyfunctionalized indenones with complete control of regioselectivity. This approach features a broad substrate scope, excellent functional group tolerance, and synthetic utility in the straightforward synthesis of biologically relevant molecules.







Abstract
A set of rhenium&#8208;catalyzed arylation&#8211;acyl cyclizations between (hetero)arylmagnesium halides and enol lactones through a cascade C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2)/C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2) bond formation under mild reaction conditions has been developed. Indeed, a wide range of functional groups on both organomagnesium halides and enol lactones is well tolerated by the simple rhenium catalysis, thus furnishing polyfunctionalized indenones in one&#8208;pot fashion and with complete control of the regioselectivity. Moreover, this approach also provides a straightforward synthetic route to neolignan and (iso)pauciflorol&#8197;F. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the reaction involves a sequence of syn&#8208;carborhenation and intramolecular nucleophilic addition.

         <title>Molecular Weight Engineering in High&#8208;Performance Ambipolar Emissive Mesopolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular weight engineering of red&#8208;emissive mesopolymer with no detectable homo&#8208;coupling defects, fine&#8208;tuned energy level and better bipolar mobility was carried out. OFET and OLED based on the materials mark application potential in optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
Mesopolymers with high solubility, free of structural defects, and negligible batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variation open a new avenue for organic optoelectronics. Organic light emitting transistors that combine the functions of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes and organic field&#8208;effect transistors. However, charge transport ability and light emitting strength are contradictory within one conjugated polymer. Herein, three low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight mesopolymers with thienopyrroledione&#8211;benzothiadiazole repeating units (meso&#8208;TBTF) were obtained. The mesopolymers show strong solid&#8208;state emission and high ambipolar carrier mobility. The molecular weights of meso&#8208;TBTF can be tuned by polymerization temperature. The mesopolymers have photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) of about 50&#8201;% in solution and 10&#8201;% in solid state. Polymer light emitting diodes of this material are fabricated to explore its potential use in optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Low&#8208;Dimensional Inorganic Tin Perovskite Solar Cells Prepared by Templated Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A templated growth approach, in which the crystallization of a 3D perovskite is guided by a dynamically dominant 2D structure, was established for the fabrication of a low&#8208;dimensional perovskite thin film with an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientation and a large grain size. The template growth is enabled by the reduced crystallization barrier of the 2D PEA2SnI4&#8722;xSCNx intermediate.







Abstract
The manipulation of the dimensionality and nanostructures based on the precise control of the crystal growth kinetics boosts the flourishing development of perovskite optoelectronic materials and devices. Herein, a low&#8208;dimensional inorganic tin halide perovskite, CsSnBrI2&#8722;x(SCN)x, with a mixed 2D and 3D structure is fabricated. A kinetic study indicates that Sn(SCN)2 and phenylethylamine hydroiodate can form a 2D perovskite structure that acts as a template for the growth of the 3D perovskite CsSnBrI2&#8722;x(SCN)x. The film shows an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientation and a large grain size, giving rise to reduced defect density, superior thermostability, and oxidation resistance. A solar cell based on this low&#8208;dimensional film reaches a power conversion efficiency of 5.01&#8201;%, which is the highest value for CsSnBrxI3&#8722;x perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, the device shows enhanced stability in ambient air.

The template growth is enabled by the reduced crystallization barrier of the 2D PEA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SnI&lt;sub&gt;4&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;SCN&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; intermediate.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manipulation of the dimensionality and nanostructures based on the precise control of the crystal growth kinetics boosts the flourishing development of perovskite optoelectronic materials and devices. Herein, a low-dimensional inorganic tin halide perovskite, CsSnBrI&lt;sub&gt;2&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;(SCN)&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;, with a mixed 2D and 3D structure is fabricated. A kinetic study indicates that Sn(SCN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and phenylethylamine hydroiodate can form a 2D perovskite structure that acts as a template for the growth of the 3D perovskite CsSnBrI&lt;sub&gt;2&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;(SCN)&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;. The film shows an out-of-plane orientation and a large grain size, giving rise to reduced defect density, superior thermostability, and oxidation resistance. A solar cell based on this low-dimensional film reaches a power conversion efficiency of 5.01&#8201;%, which is the highest value for CsSnBr&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;3&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, the device shows enhanced stability in ambient air.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Hybrid Electrolyte Engineering Enables Safe and Wide&#8208;Temperature Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hybrid electrolyte design inherits the merits of both aqueous and non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes, showing promising features for next&#8208;generation redox flow batteries: non&#8208;flammability, wide potential window, and wide operational temperature range. This work presents a promising electrolyte chemistry towards safe and wide&#8208;temperature large&#8208;scale energy storage.







Abstract
Electrolyte is an important component in redox flow batteries (RFBs) that determines the current capability, potential window, and safety, but both aqueous and nonaqueous electrolytes have their intrinsic limits. Here, we develop the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept hybrid electrolyte chemistry to enable the design of safe and wide&#8208;temperature RFBs. In addition to the non&#8208;flammable characteristics, the hybrid electrolyte also inherits the high electrochemical stability and wide operational temperature range. It can show a potential window of 2.5&#8197;V and maintain high ion conductivities at low temperatures. It also enables LiI to achieve high Coulombic efficiencies of &gt;99.9&#8201;%, showing long cycling stability over 800&#8197;cycles. Moreover, it enables the successful operation of Zn/LiI RFBs at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C for 150&#8197;cycles with nearly no capacity loss. This study highlights the great potential of hybrid electrolyte chemistry for the approach of safe and high&#8208;performance large&#8208;scale energy storage systems in wide temperature ranges.

         <title>Host&#8211;Guest Interactions in a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Isoreticular Series for Molecular Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The search for more efficient and stable catalysts often yields hybrid host&#8211;guest systems. This work rationally engineered a series of metal&#8211;organic frameworks as hosts and selectively positioned guests, a CO2 reduction catalyst and a photosensitizer, on the surface or inside the pores for photocatalytic solar fuel production. The results help understand host&#8211;guest interactions and provide transferrable criteria for material design.







Abstract
A strategy to improve homogeneous molecular catalyst stability, efficiency, and selectivity is the immobilization on supporting surfaces or within host matrices. Herein, we examine the co&#8208;immobilization of a CO2 reduction catalyst [ReBr(CO)3(4,4&#8242;&#8208;dcbpy)] and a photosensitizer [Ru(bpy)2(5,5&#8242;&#8208;dcbpy)]Cl2 using the isoreticular series of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) UiO&#8208;66, &#8208;67, and &#8208;68. Specific host pore size choice enables distinct catalyst and photosensitizer spatial location&#8212;either at the outer MOF particle surface or inside the MOF cavities&#8212;affecting catalyst stability, electronic communication between reaction center and photosensitizer, and consequently the apparent catalytic rates. These results allow for a rational understanding of an optimized supramolecular layout of catalyst, photosensitizer, and host matrix.

         <title>Collective Vibrational Strong Coupling Effects on Molecular Vibrational Relaxation and Energy Transfer: Numerical Insights via Cavity Molecular Dynamics Simulations**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We performed cavity molecular dynamics simulations and showed that, under vibrational strong coupling conditions, vibrational relaxation and energy transfer from hot to thermal molecules can be accelerated relative to that outside a cavity due to polariton&#8208;accelerated intermolecular vibrational energy transfer.







Abstract
For a small fraction of hot CO2 molecules immersed in a liquid&#8208;phase CO2 thermal bath, classical cavity molecular dynamics simulations show that forming collective vibrational strong coupling (VSC) between the C=O asymmetric stretch of CO2 molecules and a cavity mode accelerates hot&#8208;molecule relaxation. This acceleration stems from the fact that polaritons can be transiently excited during the nonequilibrium process, which facilitates intermolecular vibrational energy transfer. The VSC effects on these rates 1)&#8197;resonantly depend on the cavity mode detuning, 2)&#8197;cooperatively depend on Rabi splitting, and 3)&#8197;collectively scale with the number of hot molecules. For larger cavity volumes, the average VSC effect per molecule can remain meaningful for up to N&#8776;104 molecules forming VSC. Moreover, the transiently excited lower polariton prefers to relax by transferring its energy to the tail of the molecular energy distribution rather than distributing it equally to all thermal molecules. As far as the parameter dependence is concerned, the vibrational relaxation data presented here appear analogous to VSC catalysis in Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot microcavities.

         <title>Novel Anthracycline Utorubicin for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utorubicin (UTO) is a novel anthracycline with higher anticancer activity than doxorubicin in cultured cancer cells. Nanoencapsulation of UTO in polymeric vesicles functionalized with tumor&#8208;penetrating peptides increases the cytotoxicity of the drug in receptor&#8208;positive cells in vitro and, after systemic administration into mice bearing triple&#8208;negative tumors, potentiates UTO accumulation in malignant tissue.







Abstract
Novel anticancer compounds and their precision delivery systems are actively developed to create potent and well&#8208;tolerated anticancer therapeutics. Here, we report the synthesis of a novel anthracycline, Utorubicin (UTO), and its preclinical development as an anticancer payload for nanocarriers. Free UTO was significantly more toxic to cultured tumor cell lines than the clinically used anthracycline, doxorubicin. Nanoformulated UTO, encapsulated in polymeric nanovesicles (polymersomes, PS), reduced the viability of cultured malignant cells and this effect was potentiated by functionalization with a tumor&#8208;penetrating peptide (TPP). Systemic peptide&#8208;guided PS showed preferential accumulation in triple&#8208;negative breast tumor xenografts implanted in mice. At the same systemic UTO dose, the highest UTO accumulation in tumor tissue was seen for the TPP&#8208;targeted PS, followed by nontargeted PS, and free doxorubicin. Our study suggests potential applications for UTO in the treatment of malignant diseases and encourages further preclinical and clinical studies on UTO as a nanocarrier payload for precision cancer therapy.

         <title>Branched Aggregates with Tunable Morphology via Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly of Azobenzene&#8208;Derived Molecular Double&#8208;Brushes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hierarchical self&#8208;assembly has been one of the most effective approach to fabricate nature&#8208;inspired materials with subtle nanostructures and variable functions. Herein, we report a distinct hierarchical self&#8208;assembly process of azobenzene&#8208;derived Janus molecular double&#8208;brushes (MDBs) with each graft site carrying a poly(azobenzene&#8208;acrylate) (PAzo) chain and a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) chain. Asymmetric tapered&#8208;worm (ATW) nanostructures with chain&#8208;end reactivity assembling from the azobenzene&#8208;derived MDBs serve as primary subunits to prepare branched supermicelles by increasing water content (Cw) in THF/water, which is predominantly facilitated by the distinctive molecular brush architecture and the intermolecular interaction of PAzo brushes. Various natural antedon&#8208;shaped multiarm worm&#8208;like aggregates (MWAs) can be created depending on Cw&#160;via the particle&#8208;particle connection of ATWs. Intriguingly, the azobenzene moieties undergo  trans&#8208;cis  &#160;isomerization upon UV irradiation and further promote a morphology evolution of MWAs, leading the formation of starfish&#8208;shaped aggregates. Subsequently, multiscale luidia ciliaris and crossaster papposus&#8208;shaped supermicelles with different features of central body and arms are prepared by manipulating irradiation time.</dc:description>

Various natural antedon-shaped multiarm worm-like aggregates (MWAs) can be created depending on Cw&#160;via the particle-particle connection of ATWs. Intriguingly, the azobenzene moieties undergo  trans-cis  &#160;isomerization upon UV irradiation and further promote a morphology evolution of MWAs, leading the formation of starfish-shaped aggregates. Subsequently, multiscale luidia ciliaris and crossaster papposus-shaped supermicelles with different features of central body and arms are prepared by manipulating irradiation time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tight covalent organic framework membranes for efficient anion transport via molecular precursor engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fabricating covalent organic frameworks (COFs) membranes with tight structure, which can fully utilize well&#8208;defined framework structure and thus achieve superior conduction performance, remains a grand challenge. Herein, through molecular precursor engineering of COFs, we reported the fabrication of tight COFs membrane with the ever&#8208;reported highest hydroxide ion conductivity over 200 mS cm&#8208;1 at 80 &#176;C, 100% RH. Six quaternary ammonium&#8208;functionalized COFs were synthesized by assembling functional hydrazides and different aldehyde precursors. In an organic&#8208;aqueous reaction system, the impact of the aldehyde precursors with different size, electrophilicity and hydrophilicity on the reaction&#8208;diffusion process for fabricating COFs membranes was elucidated. Particularly, more hydrophilic aldehydes were prone to push the reaction zone from the interface region to the aqueous phase of the reaction system, the tight membranes were thus fabricated via phase&#8208;transfer polymerization process, conferring around 4~8 times the anion conductivity over the loose membranes via interfacial polymerization process.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Stabilized Gold Nanoclusters in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultrafine gold nanoclusters (Au&#8208;NCs) are susceptible to migrate and aggregate, even in porosity of many crystalline solids.&#160; N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are a class of structurally diverse ligands for stabilization of Au&#8208;NCs in homogeneous chemistry, showing catalytic reactivity in CO  2  activation. Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate a heterogeneous nucleation approach to stabilize ultrasmall and highly dispersed gold nanoclusters in a metal&#8208;free NHC&#8208;functionalized porous matrix. The sizes of gold nanoclusters are tunable from 1.3 nm to 1.8 nm based on the interpenetration of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) topology. Control experiments using amine or imidazolium&#8208;functionalized MOFs afforded aggregation of Au species. The resultant Au&#8208;NC@MOF composite exhibits steady and excellent activity in photocatalytic CO  2  reduction, superior to the control mixtures without NHC&#8208;ligand stabilization.&#160; The mechanistic studies reveal the synergistic catalytic effect of MOFs and Au&#8208;NCs through the MOF&#8208;NHC&#8208;Au covalent bonding bridges.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and cellular labeling of multifunctional phosphatidylinositol bis&#8208; and trisphosphate derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We synthesized the first multifunctionalized phosphoinositide polyphosphate derivatives featuring a photo&#8208;removable protecting group (&#8220;cage&#8221;), a photo&#8208;crosslinkable diazirine group and a terminal alkyne group useful for click chemistry. We demonstrate that the lipid derivatives readily enter cells. After photo&#8208;crosslinking, cell fixation and fluorescent tagging via click chemistry, we determined the intracellular location of the lipid derivatives before and after uncaging of the lipids. We find that there is rapid trafficking of PI(3,4)P  2  and PI(3,4,5)P  3  derivatives to the plasma membrane, opening the intriguing possibility that there is active transport of these lipids involved. We employed the photo&#8208;crosslinking and click chemistry functions to analyze the proteome of PI(3,4,5)P  3  &#8208;binding proteins. From the latter, we validated by RNAi that the putative lipid binding proteins ATP11A and MPP6 are involved in the transport of PI(3,4,5)P  3  to the plasma membrane.</dc:description>

         <title>Rules of Nucleophilic Additions to Zigzag Nanographene Diones**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 24, Page 13521-13528, June 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the unexpected selectivities of nucleophilic additions to zigzag nanographene diones, the authors explored and present the rules that govern these reactions. The Fukui function analysis shows a clear difference in reactivity of Kekul&#233; versus non&#8208;Kekul&#233; systems, where the former favor 1,2&#8208; and the latter 1,4&#8208;addition. The size of both the electrophile and the nucleophile may, however, alter the reaction outcome.







Abstract
Nucleophilic addition of carbon&#8208;centered nucleophiles to nanographene ketones represents a valuable late&#8208;stage method for the functionalization of zigzag nanographenes, but its use is rare in the chemical literature. Using two model systems, non&#8208;Kekul&#233; triangulene&#8208;4,8&#8208;dione and Kekul&#233; anthanthrone, we identify unexpected regioselectivities and uncover the rules that govern these reactions. Considering the large number of nanographene ketones that have been reported since the pioneering work of Eric Clar, this method enables synthesis and exploration of hitherto unknown functionalized nanographenes.

         <title>Periodicity in the Electrochemical Dissolution of Transition Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 24, Page 13343-13349, June 7, 2021. </description>

In this study, intrinsic metal descriptors based on theoretical considerations are linked to experimentally determined dissolution rates. Clear trends are identified between the dissolution during oxide formation and the metal&#8211;metal cohesive energy, as well as between the dissolution during the reduction of an oxide and the metal&#8211;oxygen adsorption energy.







Abstract
Extensive research efforts are currently dedicated to the search for new electrocatalyst materials in which expensive and rare noble metals are replaced with cheaper and more abundant transition metals. Recently, numerous alloys, oxides, and composites with such metals have been identified as highly active electrocatalysts through the use of high&#8208;throughput screening methods with the help of activity descriptors. Up to this point, stability has lacked such descriptors. Hence, we elucidate the role of intrinsic metal/oxide properties on the corrosion behavior of representative 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metals. Electrochemical dissolution of nine transition metals is quantified using online inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS). Based on the obtained dissolution data in alkaline and acidic media, we establish clear periodic correlations between the amount of dissolved metal, the cohesive energy of the metal atoms (Ecoh), and the energy of oxygen adsorption on the metal (&#916;HO,ads). Such correlations can support the knowledge&#8208;driven search for more stable electrocatalysts.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Ketones from Methyl Esters by Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 24, Page 13476-13483, June 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methyl esters are shown to participate in intermolecular Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Due to the mild nature of organoboron reagents, the product ketones are inert to the reaction conditions, avoiding over reactivity issues prominent with more aggressive organometallic nucleophiles.







Abstract
The direct conversion of alkyl esters to ketones has been hindered by the sluggish reactivity of the starting materials and the susceptibility of the product towards subsequent nucleophilic attack. We have now achieved a cross&#8208;coupling approach to this transformation using nickel, a bulky N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand, and alkyl organoboron coupling partners. 65 alkyl ketones bearing diverse functional groups and heterocyclic scaffolds have been synthesized with this method. Catalyst&#8208;controlled chemoselectivity is observed for C(acyl)&#8722;O bond activation of multi&#8208;functional substrates bearing other bonds prone to cleavage by Ni, including aryl ether, aryl fluoride, and N&#8208;Ph amide functional groups.

     alt="Direct Synthesis of Ketones from Methyl Esters by Nickel-Catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Coupling"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methyl esters are shown to participate in intermolecular Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross-coupling reactions. Due to the mild nature of organoboron reagents, the product ketones are inert to the reaction conditions, avoiding over reactivity issues prominent with more aggressive organometallic nucleophiles.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The direct conversion of alkyl esters to ketones has been hindered by the sluggish reactivity of the starting materials and the susceptibility of the product towards subsequent nucleophilic attack. We have now achieved a cross-coupling approach to this transformation using nickel, a bulky N-heterocyclic carbene ligand, and alkyl organoboron coupling partners. 65 alkyl ketones bearing diverse functional groups and heterocyclic scaffolds have been synthesized with this method. Catalyst-controlled chemoselectivity is observed for C(acyl)&#8722;O bond activation of multi-functional substrates bearing other bonds prone to cleavage by Ni, including aryl ether, aryl fluoride, and N-Ph amide functional groups. Density functional theory calculations provide mechanistic support for a Ni&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;/Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; catalytic cycle and demonstrate how stabilizing non-covalent interactions between the bulky catalyst and substrate are critical for the reaction's success.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Stereoselective Directed Cationic Cascades Enabled by Molecular Anchoring in Terpene Cyclases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 24, Page 13251-13256, June 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic cyclizations are one of nature's tools for scaffold diversification. However, these transformations are very difficult to control by chemical catalysts. Herein, a strategy to gain full control over such reaction types is presented by introducing/ breaking specific hydrogen&#8208;bonds inside terpene cyclases. Consequently, valuable flavor and fragrance compounds were produced in gram&#8208;scale within a single enzymatic step in water.







Abstract
Cascade reactions appeared as a cutting&#8208;edge strategy to streamline the assembly of complex structural scaffolds from naturally available precursors in an atom&#8208;, as well as time, labor&#8208; and cost&#8208;efficient way. We herein report a strategy to control cationic cyclization cascades by exploiting the ability of anchoring dynamic substrates in the active site of terpene cyclases via designed hydrogen bonding. Thereby, it is possible to induce &#8220;directed&#8221; cyclizations in contrast to established &#8220;non&#8208;stop&#8221; cyclizations (99:1) and predestinate cascade termination at otherwise catalytically barely accessible intermediates. As a result, we are able to provide efficient access to naturally widely occurring apocarotenoids, value&#8208;added flavors and fragrances in gram&#8208;scale by replacing multi&#8208;stage synthetic routes to a single step with unprecedented selectivity (&gt;99.5&#8201;% ee) and high yields (up to 89&#8201;%).

         <title>Chemical Evolution of Antivirals Against Enterovirus D68 through Protein&#8208;Templated Knoevenagel Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 24, Page 13294-13301, June 7, 2021. </description>

Self&#8208;organized virus killing: Antivirals are generated through aldol condensations catalyzed by the 3C protease of enterovirus D68 and inhibit viral proliferation in infected human cells. Best inhibitors are slow and sticky. The process demonstrates a potentially native mechanism for the evolution of functional bioactive molecules.







Abstract
The generation of bioactive molecules from inactive precursors is a crucial step in the chemical evolution of life, however, mechanistic insights into this aspect of abiogenesis are scarce. Here, we investigate the protein&#8208;catalyzed formation of antivirals by the 3C&#8208;protease of enterovirus D68. The enzyme induces aldol condensations yielding inhibitors with antiviral activity in cells. Kinetic and thermodynamic analyses reveal that the bioactivity emerges from a dynamic reaction system including inhibitor formation, alkylation of the protein target by the inhibitors, and competitive addition of non&#8208;protein nucleophiles to the inhibitors. The most active antivirals are slowly reversible inhibitors with elongated target residence times. The study reveals first examples for the chemical evolution of bio&#8208;actives through protein&#8208;catalyzed, non&#8208;enzymatic C&#8722;C couplings. The discovered mechanism works under physiological conditions and might constitute a native process of drug development.

         <title>Designing a Single Protein&#8208;Chain Reporter for Opioid Detection at Cellular Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 24, Page 13358-13365, June 7, 2021. </description>

A genetically&#8208;encoded fluorescent sensor was designed for the mu&#8208;opioid receptor using a novel sensor mechanism. In the absence of opioids, Nb39 interacts with the circular permuted green fluorescent protein (cpGFP) and inhibits the fluorophore maturation of cpGFP. When the opioid binds to the opioid receptor (OR), Nb39 binds to the intracellular side of the activated OR. This removes Nb39 from cpGFP, allowing the cpGFP fluorophore to mature, resulting in an opioid&#8208;induced fluorescence increase.







Abstract
Mu&#8208;opioid receptor (MOR) signaling regulates multiple neuronal pathways, including those involved in pain, reward, and respiration. To advance the understanding of MOR's roles in pain modulation, there is a need for high&#8208;throughput screening methods of opioids in vitro and high&#8208;resolution mapping of opioids in the brain. To fill this need, we designed and characterized a genetically encoded fluorescent reporter, called Single&#8208;chain Protein&#8208;based Opioid Transmission Indicator Tool for MOR (M&#8208;SPOTIT). M&#8208;SPOTIT represents a new and unique mechanism for fluorescent reporter design and can detect MOR activation, leaving a persistent green fluorescence mark for image analysis. M&#8208;SPOTIT showed an opioid&#8208;dependent signal to noise ratio (S/N) up to 12.5 and was able to detect as fast as a 30&#8208;second opioid exposure in HEK293T cell culture. Additionally, it showed an opioid&#8208;dependent S/N up to 4.6 in neuronal culture and detected fentanyl with an EC50 of 15&#8197;nM. M&#8208;SPOTIT will potentially be useful for high&#8208;throughput detection of opioids in cell cultures and cellular&#8208;resolution detection of opioids in vivo. M&#8208;SPOTIT's novel mechanism can be used as a platform to design other G&#8208;protein&#8208;coupled receptor&#8208;based sensors.

Aryl/aryl diazoalkanes undergo distinct, chemoselective reactions with alkynes upon blue light photolysis. This report showcases how electronic properties and spin state influence the reaction outcome of metal&#8208;free carbene transfer reactions by experimentation and theory.







Abstract
Controlling the reactivity of carbene intermediates is a key parameter in the development of selective carbene transfer reactions and is usually achieved by metal complexes via singlet metal&#8208;carbene intermediates. In this combined experimental and computational studies, we show that the reactivity of free diaryl carbenes can be controlled by the electronic properties of the substituents without the need of external additives. The introduction of electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing groups results in a significant perturbation of singlet triplet energy splitting of the diaryl carbene intermediate and of activation energies of consecutive carbene transfer reactions. This strategy now overcomes a long&#8208;standing paradigm in the reactivity of diaryl carbenes and allows the realization of highly chemoselective carbene transfer reactions with alkynes. We could show that free diaryl carbenes can be readily accessed via photolysis of the corresponding diazo compounds and that these carbenes can undergo highly chemoselective cyclopropenation, cascade, or C&#8722;H functionalization reactions. Experimental and theoretical mechanistic analyses confirm the participation of different carbene spin states and rationalize for the observed reactivity.

A dizinc&#8208;sodium catalyst has been synthesized which allows precise control of CO2 incorporation within poly(carbonates), &#8208;esters, and &#8208;ethers. The catalyst selectively switches between three distinct catalytic cycles; kinetics and structure&#8211;activity studies inform the mechanisms of switchable polymerization catalysis.







Abstract
A challenge in polymer synthesis using CO2 is to precisely control CO2 placement in the backbone and chain end groups. Here, a new catalyst class delivers unusual selectivity and is self&#8208;switched between different polymerization cycles to construct specific sequences and desirable chain&#8208;end chemistries. The best catalyst is a trinuclear dizinc(II)sodium(I) complex and it functions without additives or co&#8208;catalysts. It shows excellent rates across different ring&#8208;opening (co)polymerization catalytic cycles and allows precise control of CO2 incorporation within polyesters and polyethers, thereby allowing access to new polymer chemistries without requiring esoteric monomers, multi&#8208;reactor processes or complex post&#8208;polymerization procedures. The structures, kinetics and mechanisms of the catalysts are investigated, providing evidence for intermediate speciation and uncovering the factors governing structure and composition and thereby guiding future catalyst design.

An approach is described for high&#8208;throughput counting and superresolution mapping of surface proteins on exosomes, using a combination of a single&#8208;molecule sensitive flow technique and an adaptive superresolution imaging method enabled by a new class of transistor&#8208;like, photoswitching polymer dots.







Abstract
A method for high&#8208;throughput counting and superresolution mapping of surface proteins on exosomes is described. The method combines a single&#8208;molecule sensitive flow technique and an adaptive superresolution imaging method. Exosomes stained with membrane dye and dye&#8208;conjugated antibodies were analyzed using a microfluidic platform at a flow rate of 100&#8197;exosome&#8201;s&#8722;1 to determine size and protein copy number. Superresolution mapping was performed with exosomes labeled with novel transistor&#8208;like, semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots), which exhibit spontaneous blinking with &lt;5&#8197;nm localization error and a broad range of optical&#8208;adjustable duty cycles. Based on the copy numbers extracted from the flow analysis, the switch&#8208;on frequency of the Pdots were finely adjusted so that structures of hundreds of exosomes were obtained within five minutes. The high throughput and high sensitivity of this method offer clear advantages for characterization of exosomes and similar biological vesicles.

         <title>Diversifying Metal&#8211;Ligand Cooperative Catalysis in Semi&#8208;Synthetic [Mn]&#8208;Hydrogenases</title>

A series of [Mn]&#8208;hydrogenases were reconstituted using specifically designed MnI complexes. In two catalytically active [Mn]&#8208;hydrogenases, the mode of metal&#8211;ligand cooperation is different from that of the native [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase. One such [Mn]&#8208;hydrogenase exhibits the highest specific activity among all known semi&#8208;synthetic [Mn]&#8208; and [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenases.







Abstract
The reconstitution of [Mn]&#8208;hydrogenases using a series of MnI complexes is described. These complexes are designed to have an internal base or pro&#8208;base that may participate in metal&#8211;ligand cooperative catalysis or have no internal base or pro&#8208;base. Only MnI complexes with an internal base or pro&#8208;base are active for H2 activation; only [Mn]&#8208;hydrogenases incorporating such complexes are active for hydrogenase reactions. These results confirm the essential role of metal&#8211;ligand cooperation for H2 activation by the MnI complexes alone and by [Mn]&#8208;hydrogenases. Owing to the nature and position of the internal base or pro&#8208;base, the mode of metal&#8211;ligand cooperation in two active [Mn]&#8208;hydrogenases is different from that of the native [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase. One [Mn]&#8208;hydrogenase has the highest specific activity of semi&#8208;synthetic [Mn]&#8208; and [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenases. This work demonstrates reconstitution of active artificial hydrogenases using synthetic complexes differing greatly from the native active site.

         <title>Observing a Zeolite Nucleus (Subcrystal) with a Uniform Framework Structure and Its Oriented Attachment without Single&#8208;Molecule Addition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 24, Page 13444-13451, June 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work clearly observed the MFI zeolite nucleus (subcrystal) with highly uniform microporous structure and detailed its evolution and effects on the crystallization. Notably, a unitary aggregation growth between high&#8208;ordered zeolite nuclei occurred under the mild condition, implying a new possibility to obtain heterogeneous zeotype materials.







Abstract
Multiple and complex crystallization process of zeolite including complementary single&#8208;molecule condensation and particle assembly, and alternately dominant nucleation and growth behavior, plays the critical role in zeolite crystallization but meanwhile makes us hard to study the respective effects. Herein, we strip nuclei from the synthetic solution and find that high&#8208;ordered nucleus (subcrystal) is the premise to ignite high&#8208;speed growth of zeolite crystal. The high&#8208;ordered subcrystals with the size of only 6&#8211;10&#8197;nm possess regular aperture structure and microporous area similar to zeolite nanocrystal. Interestingly, a unitary oriented aggregation process of the subcrystals towards nanosheets is well observed and characterized where single&#8208;molecule addition process is greatly repressed. If a wider range of zeotype nuclei can be expanded, a new synthetic strategy of zeotype materials with heterogeneous framework and active sites may be expected, which may novelize zeolite catalytic properties.

         <title>Vapochromism and Magnetochemical Switching of a Nickel(II) Paddlewheel Complex by Reversible NH3 Uptake and Release</title>

The Ni2 paddlewheel complex can reversibly bind ammonia. This triggers spin&#8208;state switching from dia&#8208; to paramagnetic and a change of color. Coordination of NH3 is fully reversible in solution, in solid state as well as encapsulated in a polyurethane foil.







Abstract
Reaction of [NiCl2(PnH)4] (1) (PnH=6&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;pyridazine&#8208;3&#8208;thione) with NiCl2 affords the binuclear paddlewheel (PW) complex [Ni2(Pn)4] (2). Diamagnetic complex 2 is the first example of a PW complex capable of reversibly binding and releasing NH3. The NH3 ligand in [Ni2(Pn)4(NH3)] (2&#8901;NH3) enforces major spectroscopic and magnetic susceptibility changes, thus displaying vapochromic properties (&#955;max(2)=532&#8197;nm, &#955;max(2&#8901;NH3)=518&#8197;nm) and magnetochemical switching (2: S=0; 2&#8901;NH3: S=1). Upon repeated adsorption/desorption cycles of NH3 the PW core remains intact. Compound 2 can be embedded into thin polyurethane films (2P) under retention of its sensing abilities. Therefore, 2 qualifies as reversible optical probe for ammonia. The magnetochemical switching of 2 and 2&#8901;NH3 was studied in detail by SQUID measurements showing that in 2&#8901;NH3, solely the Ni atom coordinated the NH3 molecule is responsible for the paramagnetic behavior.

For the first time, we demonstrate an approach to building up a bisfunctionalized MoS2 hybrid structure through successively treating activated MoS2 with alkyl iodide and aryl diazonium salt. This approach can be used to modify both colloidal and substrate&#8208;supported MoS2 nanosheets.







Abstract
Covalent functionalization of two&#8208;dimensional molybdenum disulfide (2D MoS2) holds great promise in developing robust organic&#8208;MoS2 hybrid structures. Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate an approach to building up a bisfunctionalized MoS2 hybrid structure through successively reacting activated MoS2 with alkyl iodide and aryl diazonium salts. This approach can be utilized to modify both colloidal and substrate supported MoS2 nanosheets. We have discovered that compared to the adducts formed through the reactions of MoS2 with diazonium salts, those formed through the reactions of MoS2 with alkyl iodides display higher reactivity towards further reactions with electrophiles. We are convinced that our systematic study on the formation and reactivity of covalently functionalized MoS2 hybrids will provide some practical guidance on multi&#8208;angle tailoring of the properties of 2D MoS2 for various potential applications.

         <title>Ligand Controls the Activity of Light&#8208;Driven Water Oxidation Catalyzed by Nickel(II) Porphyrin Complexes in Neutral Homogeneous Aqueous Solutions</title>

Four photostable, tetraanionic nickel(II)&#8208;porphyrin water oxidation catalysts were evaluated in a neutral&#8208;to&#8208;acidic aqueous photocatalytic water oxidation system using [Ru(bpy)3]2+ as photosensitizer and [S2O8]2&#8722; as electron acceptor. The best photocatalytic dioxygen evolution was obtained with a well&#8208;balanced electron density on the Ni&#8208;porphyrin catalyst.







Abstract
Finding photostable, first&#8208;row transition metal&#8208;based molecular systems for photocatalytic water oxidation is a step towards sustainable solar fuel production. Herein, we discovered that nickel(II) hydrophilic porphyrins are molecular catalysts for photocatalytic water oxidation in neutral to acidic aqueous solutions using [Ru(bpy)3]2+ as photosensitizer and [S2O8]2&#8722; as sacrificial electron acceptor. Electron&#8208;poorer Ni&#8208;porphyrins bearing 8 fluorine or 4 methylpyridinium substituents as electron&#8208;poorer porphyrins afforded 6&#8208;fold higher turnover frequencies (TOFs; ca. 0.65&#8197;min&#8722;1) than electron&#8208;richer analogues. However, the electron&#8208;poorest Ni&#8208;porphyrin bearing 16 fluorine substituents was photocatalytically inactive under such conditions, because the potential at which catalytic O2 evolution starts was too high (+1.23&#8197;V vs. NHE) to be driven by the photochemically generated [Ru(bpy)3]3+. Critically, these Ni&#8208;porphyrin catalysts showed excellent stability in photocatalytic conditions, as a second photocatalytic run replenished with a new dose of photosensitizer, afforded only 1&#8211;3&#8201;% less O2 than during the first photocatalytic run.

         <title>Natural Glycoforms of Human Interleukin 6 Show Atypical Plasma Clearance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 24, Page 13380-13387, June 7, 2021. </description>

Sugars affect plasma lifetime: The main glycoforms of human interleukin 6 (IL&#8208;6) were synthesized by native chemical ligation combining chemical, enzymatic, and recombinant methods. The native fold was evident from CD spectra, mass spectrometry, crystallography, and receptor binding. In vivo assays showed a different plasma clearance for each glycoform with an unexpected correlation to the glycan structures.







Abstract
A library of glycoforms of human interleukin 6 (IL&#8208;6) comprising complex and mannosidic N&#8208;glycans was generated by semisynthesis. The three segments were connected by sequential native chemical ligation followed by two&#8208;step refolding. The central glycopeptide segments were assembled by pseudoproline&#8208;assisted Lansbury aspartylation and subsequent enzymatic elongation of complex N&#8208;glycans. Nine IL&#8208;6 glycoforms were synthesized, seven of which were evaluated for in vivo plasma clearance in rats and compared to non&#8208;glycosylated recombinant IL&#8208;6 from E. coli. Each IL&#8208;6 glycoform was tested in three animals and reproducibly showed individual serum clearances depending on the structure of the N&#8208;glycan. The clearance rates were atypical, since the 2,6&#8208;sialylated glycoforms of IL&#8208;6 cleared faster than the corresponding asialo IL&#8208;6 with terminal galactoses. Compared to non&#8208;glycosylated IL&#8208;6 the plasma clearance of IL&#8208;6 glycoforms was delayed in the presence of larger and multibranched N&#8208;glycans in most cases

         <title>Interfering with Metabolic Profile of Triple&#8208;Negative Breast Cancers Using Rationally Designed Metformin Prodrugs</title>

AuIII prodrugs of anti&#8208;diabetic medicines metformin and phenformin were developed. These compounds effectively decreased triple negative breast tumor burden. The mode of action of novel complexes was linked to energetic crisis and abolishment of pro&#8208;survival responses leading to irreversible cell death.







Abstract
Triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer, characterized by an aberrant metabolic phenotype with high metastatic capacity, resulting in poor patient prognoses and low survival rates. We designed a series of novel AuIII cyclometalated prodrugs of energy&#8208;disrupting Type II antidiabetic drugs namely, metformin and phenformin. Prodrug activation and release of the metformin ligand was achieved by tuning the cyclometalated AuIII fragment. The lead complex 3met was 6000&#8208;fold more cytotoxic compared to uncoordinated metformin and significantly reduced tumor burden in mice with aggressive breast cancers with lymphocytic infiltration into tumor tissues. These effects was ascribed to 3met interfering with energy production in TNBCs and inhibiting associated pro&#8208;survival responses to induce deadly metabolic catastrophe.

         <title>Efficient (&gt;20&#8201;%) and Stable All&#8208;Inorganic Cesium Lead Triiodide Solar Cell Enabled by Thiocyanate Molten Salts</title>

A new urea&#8208;ammonium thiocyanate (UAT) molten salt was introduced as the additive in all&#8208;inorganic cesium lead triiodide solar cell, as a modification strategy to fully release and exploit coordination activities of SCN&#8722; to deposit high&#8208;quality CsPbI3 film. Thus, the UAT&#8208;based devices can provide an encouraging PCE up to 20.08&#8201;% with excellent operational stability of over 1000&#8197;h.







Abstract
Besides widely used surface passivation, engineering the film crystallization is an important and more fundamental route to improve the performance of all&#8208;inorganic perovskite solar cells. Herein, we have developed a urea&#8208;ammonium thiocyanate (UAT) molten salt modification strategy to fully release and exploit coordination activities of SCN&#8722; to deposit high&#8208;quality CsPbI3 film for efficient and stable all&#8208;inorganic solar cells. The UAT is derived by the hydrogen bond interactions between urea and NH4+ from NH4SCN. With the UAT, the crystal quality of the CsPbI3 film has been significantly improved and a long single&#8208;exponential charge recombination lifetime of over 30&#8197;ns has been achieved. With these benefits, the cell efficiency has been promoted to over 20&#8201;% (steady&#8208;state efficiency of 19.2&#8201;%) with excellent operational stability over 1000&#8197;h. These results demonstrate a promising development route of the CsPbI3 related photoelectric devices.

         <title>Electrochemical Characterization of Single Layer Graphene/Electrolyte Interface: Effect of Solvent on the Interfacial Capacitance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 24, Page 13317-13322, June 7, 2021. </description>

The charge of the double layer capacitance at a single layer graphene (SLG) electrode was studied in neat (EMIm&#8208;TFSI) and solvated (with acetonitrile) ionic liquid electrodes. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and gravimetric electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance measurements evidence that the presence of solvent drastically increases the charge carrier density at the SLG/ionic liquid interface.







Abstract
The development of the basic understanding of the charge storage mechanisms in electrodes for energy storage applications needs deep characterization of the electrode/electrolyte interface. In this work, we studied the charge of the double layer capacitance at single layer graphene (SLG) electrode used as a model material, in neat (EMIm&#8208;TFSI) and solvated (with acetonitrile) ionic liquid electrodes. The combination of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and gravimetric electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) measurements evidence that the presence of solvent drastically increases the charge carrier density at the SLG/ionic liquid interface. The capacitance is thus governed not only by the electronic properties of the graphene, but also by the specific organization of the electrolyte side at the SLG surface originating from the strong interactions existing between the EMIm+ cations and SLG surface. EQCM measurements also show that the carbon structure, with the presence of sp2 carbons, affects the charge storage mechanism by favoring counter&#8208;ion adsorption on SLG electrode versus ion exchange mechanism in amorphous porous carbons.

         <title>Orientational Jahn&#8211;Teller Isomerism in the Dark&#8208;Stable State of Nature's Water Oxidase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 24, Page 13493-13499, June 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dark&#8208;stable resting state of the biological oxygen&#8208;evolving complex is shown to accommodate a rare type of functionally important MnIII orientational Jahn&#8211;Teller isomerism that is identified as the electronic origin of subsequent valence isomerism in the catalytic cycle of water oxidation.







Abstract
The tetramanganese&#8211;calcium cluster of the oxygen&#8208;evolving complex of photosystem II adopts electronically and magnetically distinct but interconvertible valence isomeric forms in its first light&#8208;driven oxidized catalytic state, S2. This bistability is implicated in gating the final catalytic states preceding O&#8722;O bond formation, but it is unknown how the biological system enables its emergence and controls its effect. Here we show that the Mn4CaO5 cluster in the resting (dark&#8208;stable) S1 state adopts orientational Jahn&#8211;Teller isomeric forms arising from a directional change in electronic configuration of the &#8220;dangler&#8221; MnIII ion. The isomers are consistent with available structural data and explain previously unresolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic observations on the S1 state. This unique isomerism in the resting state is shown to be the electronic origin of valence isomerism in the S2 state, establishing a functional role of orientational Jahn&#8211;Teller isomerism unprecedented in biological or artificial catalysis.

         <title>B&#8211;B vs. B&#8211;H Bond Activation in a (&#956;&#8208;Hydrido)diborane(4) Anion upon Cycloaddition with CO2, Isocyanates, or Carbodiimides</title>

Unprecedented cycloaddition reactions of two isomeric (hydrido)diborane(4) anions with a homologous heterocumulene series proceed via B&#8211;B or B&#8211;H bond activation. Our diborane starting materials exhibit sterically exposed BHB cores, allowing us to contribute experimental evidence to the body of theoretical work on this class of [B2H5]&#8722; anion analogs.







Abstract
The intriguing (&#956;&#8208;hydrido)diboranes(4) with their prominent pristine representative [B2H5]&#8722; have mainly been studied theoretically. We now describe the behavior of the planarized tetraaryl (&#956;&#8208;hydrido)diborane(4) anion [1H]&#8722; in cycloaddition reactions with the homologous series of heterocumulenes CO2, iPrNCO, and iPrNCNiPr. We show that a C=O bond of CO2 selectively activates the B&#8722;B bond of [1H]&#8722;, while the &#956;&#8208;H ligand is left untouched ([2H]&#8722;). The carbodiimide iPrNCNiPr, in contrast, neglects the B&#8722;B bond and rather adds the B&#8208;bonded H&#8722; ion to its central C atom to generate a formamidinate bridge across the B2 pair ([3]&#8722;). As a hybrid, the isocyanate iPrNCO combines the reactivity patterns of both its congeners and gives two products: one of them ([4H]&#8722;) is related to [2H]&#8722;, the other ([5]&#8722;) is an analog of [3]&#8722;. We finally propose a mechanistic scenario that rationalizes the individual reaction outcomes and combines them to a coherent picture of B&#8211;B vs. B&#8211;H bond activation.

The pinning effect and controllable pinning point were proposed to enhance the structural stability of sodium storage layered cathode. STEM revealed the pinned transition metal in sodium layer; in situ XRD indicated the cathode material underwent an ultra&#8208;low volume variation of 0.6&#8201;% in the whole charge&#8211;discharge process.







Abstract
Layered oxides as the cathode materials of sodium&#8208;ion batteries are receiving extensive attention due to their high capacity and flexible composition. However, the layered cathode tends to be thermodynamically and electrochemically unstable during (de)sodiation. Herein, we propose the pinning effect and controllable pinning point in sodium storage layered cathodes to enhance the structural stability and achieve optimal electrochemical performance. 0&#8201;%, 2.5&#8201;% and 7.3&#8201;% transition&#8208;metal occupancies in Na&#8208;site as pinning points are obtained in Na0.67Mn0.5Co0.5&#8722;xFexO2. 2.5&#8201;% Na&#8208;site pinned by Fe3+ is beneficial to restrain the potential slab sliding and enhance the structural stability, resulting in an ultra&#8208;low volume variation of 0.6&#8201;% and maintaining the smooth two&#8208;dimensional channel for Na&#8208;ion transfer. The Na0.67Mn0.5Co0.4Fe0.1O2 cathode with the optimal Fe3+ pinning delivers outstanding cycle performance of over 1000&#8197;cycles and superior rate capability up to 10&#8197;C.

         <title>Light&#8208;Activation of DNA&#8208;Methyltransferases</title>

We report light activation of DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) through the genetic encoding of a photocaged cysteine. This enables insights into the impact of cancer&#8208;related DNMT mutations on in vivo catalysis, enables local and tuneable methylation via DNMT&#8208;TAL&#8208;effector fusions, and provides insights into methylation&#8208;triggered transcriptome dynamics.







Abstract
5&#8208;Methylcytosine (5mC), the central epigenetic mark of mammalian DNA, plays fundamental roles in chromatin regulation. 5mC is written onto genomes by DNA methyltransferases (DNMT), and perturbation of this process is an early event in carcinogenesis. However, studying 5mC functions is limited by the inability to control individual DNMTs with spatiotemporal resolution in vivo. We report light&#8208;control of DNMT catalysis by genetically encoding a photocaged cysteine as a catalytic residue. This enables translation of inactive DNMTs, their rapid activation by light&#8208;decaging, and subsequent monitoring of de novo DNA methylation. We provide insights into how cancer&#8208;related DNMT mutations alter de novo methylation in vivo, and demonstrate local and tuneable cytosine methylation by light&#8208;controlled DNMTs fused to a programmable transcription activator&#8208;like effector domain targeting pericentromeric satellite&#8208;3 DNA. We further study early events of transcriptome alterations upon DNMT&#8208;catalyzed cytosine methylation. Our study sets a basis to dissect the order and kinetics of diverse chromatin&#8208;associated events triggered by normal and aberrant DNA methylation.

         <title>Automated Glycan Assembly of 19F&#8208;labeled Glycan Probes Enables High&#8208;Throughput NMR Studies of Protein&#8211;Glycan Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 24, Page 13302-13309, June 7, 2021. </description>

19F&#8208;labeled glycans produced with automated glycan assembly allowed for the high&#8208;throughput NMR screening of protein&#8211;glycan interactions. Binding to mammalian and bacterial lectins as well as enzymes was monitored in real&#8208;time with a fast assay that does not require labeled proteins or complex 2D&#8197;NMR experiments. Previously unknown glycan&#8211;lectin weak interactions were detected, and quantitative data were obtained.







Abstract
Protein&#8211;glycan interactions mediate important biological processes, including pathogen host invasion and cellular communication. Herein, we showcase an expedite approach that integrates automated glycan assembly (AGA) of 19F&#8208;labeled probes and high&#8208;throughput NMR methods, enabling the study of protein&#8211;glycan interactions. Synthetic Lewis type&#8197;2 antigens were screened against seven glycan binding proteins (GBPs), including DC&#8208;SIGN and BambL, respectively involved in HIV&#8208;1 and lung infections in immunocompromised patients, confirming the preference for fucosylated glycans (Lex, H&#8197;type&#8197;2, Ley). Previously unknown glycan&#8211;lectin weak interactions were detected, and thermodynamic data were obtained. Enzymatic reactions were monitored in real&#8208;time, delivering kinetic parameters. These results demonstrate the utility of AGA combined with 19F&#8197;NMR for the discovery and characterization of glycan&#8211;protein interactions, opening up new perspectives for 19F&#8208;labeled complex glycans.

Abstract
An unprecedented AgI&#8208;catalyzed efficient method for the coupling of imino ethers and enol diazoacetates through a [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition/C&#8722;O bond cleavage/[1,5]&#8208;proton transfer cascade process is reported. The general class of imino ethers that includes oxazolines, benzoxazoles and benzimidates are applicable substrates for these reactions that provide direct access to fully substituted pyrroles with uniformly high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity. High variability in substitution at the pyrrole 2&#8208;, 5&#8208; and N&#8208;positions characterizes this methodology that also presents an entry point for further pyrrole diversification via facile modification of resulting N&#8208;functional pyrroles.

         <title>Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Modification of the 5&#8242; Cap Maintains Translation and Increases Immunogenic Properties of mRNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 24, Page 13280-13286, June 7, 2021. </description>

Natural modifications at the 5&#8242; cap of mRNA impact translation and immunogenicity. Now, mRNAs with non&#8208;natural post&#8208;transcriptional modifications are tested regarding translation and immunogenicity, providing a new strategy to tailor mRNA for therapeutic applications.







Abstract
Eukaryotic mRNAs are emerging modalities for protein replacement therapy and vaccination. Their 5&#8242; cap is important for mRNA translation and immune response and can be naturally methylated at different positions by S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (AdoMet)&#8208;dependent methyltransferases (MTases). We report on the cosubstrate scope of the MTase CAPAM responsible for methylation at the N6&#8208;position of adenosine start nucleotides using synthetic AdoMet analogs. The chemo&#8208;enzymatic propargylation enabled production of site&#8208;specifically modified reporter&#8208;mRNAs. These cap&#8208;propargylated mRNAs were efficiently translated and showed &#8776;3&#8208;fold increased immune response in human cells. The same effects were observed when the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8212;a currently tested epitope for mRNA vaccination&#8212;was used. Site&#8208;specific chemo&#8208;enzymatic modification of eukaryotic mRNA may thus be a suitable strategy to modulate translation and immune response of mRNAs for future therapeutic applications.

We report on the cosubstrate scope of the MTase CAPAM responsible for methylation at the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-position of adenosine start nucleotides using synthetic AdoMet analogs. The chemo-enzymatic propargylation enabled production of site-specifically modified reporter-mRNAs. These cap-propargylated mRNAs were efficiently translated and showed &#8776;3-fold increased immune response in human cells. The same effects were observed when the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2&#8212;a currently tested epitope for mRNA vaccination&#8212;was used. Site-specific chemo-enzymatic modification of eukaryotic mRNA may thus be a suitable strategy to modulate translation and immune response of mRNAs for future therapeutic applications.&lt;/p&gt;

How many binding sites exist in the vital anticancer protein target tubulin? A combined computational and crystallographic fragment screening approach now answers this question and reveals 11 novel sites as well as 56 novel small&#8208;molecule ligands in tubulin.







Abstract
Tubulin plays essential roles in vital cellular activities and is the target of a wide range of proteins and ligands. Here, using a combined computational and crystallographic fragment screening approach, we addressed the question of how many binding sites exist in tubulin. We identified 27 distinct sites, of which 11 have not been described previously, and analyzed their relationship to known tubulin&#8211;protein and tubulin&#8211;ligand interactions. We further observed an intricate pocket communication network and identified 56 chemically diverse fragments that bound to 10 distinct tubulin sites. Our results offer a unique structural basis for the development of novel small molecules for use as tubulin modulators in basic research applications or as drugs. Furthermore, our method lays down a framework that may help to discover new pockets in other pharmaceutically important targets and characterize them in terms of chemical tractability and allosteric modulation.

         <title>Multicolor Mechanofluorophores for the Quantitative Detection of Covalent Bond Scission in Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 24, Page 13287-13293, June 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new platform of dual fluorescent mechanofluorophores that display covalent bond scission during material breakage by changing their optical properties was synthesized. The absorption and emission characteristics were tuned to cover the entire visible spectrum. Using photon quantitative confocal fluorescence microscopy, these new mechanofluorophores enabled the quantification of bond scission events with &#956;m resolution.







Abstract
The fracture of polymer materials is a multiscale process starting with the scission of a single molecular bond advancing to a site of failure within the bulk. Quantifying the bonds broken during this process remains a big challenge yet would help to understand the distribution and dissipation of macroscopic mechanical energy. We here show the design and synthesis of fluorogenic molecular optical force probes (mechanofluorophores) covering the entire visible spectrum in both absorption and emission. Their dual fluorescent character allows to track non&#8208;broken and broken bonds in dissolved and bulk polymers by fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy. Importantly, we develop an approach to determine the absolute number and relative fraction of intact and cleaved bonds with high local resolution. We anticipate that our mechanofluorophores in combination with our quantification methodology will allow to quantitatively describe fracture processes in materials ranging from soft hydrogels to high&#8208;performance polymers.

         <title>High Pressure In Situ Single&#8208;Crystal X&#8208;Ray Diffraction Reveals Turnstile Linker Rotation Upon Room&#8208;Temperature Stepped Uptake of Alkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 24, Page 13430-13435, June 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined crystallographic and computational investigation reveals a turnstile mechanism for the gated uptake of C1&#8211;C4 alkanes in a seemingly nonporous MOF. In situ single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals no significant structural change upon uptake of methane, while subnetwork displacement is induced by ethane uptake. Counterintuitively, only linker rotation without the creation of new space is observed for the sorption of propane and butane.







Abstract
The rare availability of suitable single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) structural data allows for the direct interpretation of the response of a framework to gas sorption and may lead to the development of improved functional porous materials. We report an in situ SCXRD structural investigation of a flexible MOF subjected to methane, ethane, propane, and butane gas pressures. Supporting theoretical investigations indicate weak host&#8211;guest interactions for the crystallographically modelled gaseous guests and, in addition, reveal that a turnstile mechanism facilitates the transport of alkanes through the seemingly nonporous system. Inflections present in the adsorption isotherms are furthermore rationalized as due to gate&#8208;opening, but without the expected creation of new accessible space.

         <title>A Supported Pd2 Dual&#8208;Atom Site Catalyst for Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 24, Page 13388-13393, June 7, 2021. </description>

A supported Pd2 dual&#8208;atom site catalyst (DAC) was synthesized and used for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). It exhibited superior CO2RR catalytic performance with 98.2&#8201;% CO faradic efficiency at &#8722;0.85&#8197;V vs. RHE, far exceeding that of Pd1 SAC, and coupled with long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom site catalysts (DACs) have emerged as a new frontier in heterogeneous catalysis because the synergistic effect between adjacent metal atoms can promote their catalytic activity while maintaining the advantages of single&#8208;atom site catalysts (SACs), like 100&#8201;% atomic utilization efficiency and excellent selectivity. Herein, a supported Pd2 DAC was synthesized and used for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) for the first time. The as&#8208;obtained Pd2 DAC exhibited superior CO2RR catalytic performance with 98.2&#8201;% CO faradic efficiency at &#8722;0.85&#8197;V vs. RHE, far exceeding that of Pd1 SAC, and coupled with long&#8208;term stability. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the intrinsic reason for the superior activity of Pd2 DAC toward CO2RR was the electron transfer between Pd atoms at the dimeric Pd sites. Thus, Pd2 DAC possessed moderate adsorption strength of CO*, which was beneficial for CO production in CO2RR.

         <title>The Interrelated Effect of Cations and Electrolyte pH on the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction on Gold Electrodes in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 24, Page 13452-13462, June 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at gold electrodes is affected by the concentration of alkali metal cations and electrolyte pH. At moderately alkaline pH, increasing the cation concentration greatly enhances the HER activity. Cations are proposed to help stabilize the transition state of the rate&#8208;determining Volmer step by a favorable interaction with the dissociating water molecule (*H&#8211;OH&#948;&#8722;&#8211;cat+).







Abstract
In this work we study the role of alkali metal cation concentration and electrolyte pH in altering the kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at gold (Au) electrodes. We show that at moderately alkaline pH (pH&#8197;11), increasing the cation concentration significantly enhances the HER activity on Au electrodes (with a reaction order &#8776;0.5). Based on these results we suggest that cations play a central role in stabilizing the transition state of the rate&#8208;determining Volmer step by favorably interacting with the dissociating water molecule (*H&#8211;OH&#948;&#8722;&#8211;cat+). Moreover, we show that increasing electrolyte pH (pH&#8197;10 to pH&#8197;13) tunes the local field strength, which in turn indirectly enhances the activity of HER by tuning the near&#8208;surface cation concentration. Interestingly, a too high near&#8208;surface cation concentration (at high pH and high cation concentration) leads to a lowering of the HER activity, which we ascribe to a blockage of the surface by near&#8208;surface cations.

Cations are proposed to help stabilize the transition state of the rate-determining Volmer step by a favorable interaction with the dissociating water molecule (*H&#8211;OH&lt;sup&gt;&#948;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;cat&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work we study the role of alkali metal cation concentration and electrolyte pH in altering the kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at gold (Au) electrodes. We show that at moderately alkaline pH (pH&#8197;11), increasing the cation concentration significantly enhances the HER activity on Au electrodes (with a reaction order &#8776;0.5). Based on these results we suggest that cations play a central role in stabilizing the transition state of the rate-determining Volmer step by favorably interacting with the dissociating water molecule (*H&#8211;OH&lt;sup&gt;&#948;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;cat&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). Moreover, we show that increasing electrolyte pH (pH&#8197;10 to pH&#8197;13) tunes the local field strength, which in turn indirectly enhances the activity of HER by tuning the near-surface cation concentration. Interestingly, a too high near-surface cation concentration (at high pH and high cation concentration) leads to a lowering of the HER activity, which we ascribe to a blockage of the surface by near-surface cations.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Red Light&#8208;Triggered Intracellular Carbon Monoxide Release Enables Selective Eradication of MRSA Infection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 24, Page 13513-13520, June 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free CO&#8208;releasing micelles can be selectively taken up by Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, exerting a narrow&#8208;spectrum bactericidal activity toward only Gram&#8208;positive bacteria under red light irradiation. The CO&#8208;releasing micelles synergistically eradicate MRSA pathogens and accelerate MRSA&#8208;infected wound healing.







Abstract
Carbon monoxide (CO) is an important gaseous signaling molecule. The use of CO&#8208;releasing molecules such as metal carbonyls enables the elucidation of the pleiotropic functions of CO. Although metal carbonyls show a broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial activity, it remains unclear whether the bactericidal property originates from the transition metals or the released CO. Here, we develop nonmetallic CO&#8208;releasing micelles via a photooxygenation mechanism of 3&#8208;hydroxyflavone derivatives, enabling CO release under red light irradiation (e.g., 650&#8197;nm). Unlike metal carbonyls that non&#8208;specifically internalize into both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, the nonmetallic micelles are selectively taken up by S. aureus instead of E. coli cells, exerting a selective bactericidal effect. Further, we demonstrate that the CO&#8208;releasing micelles can cure methicillin&#8208;resistant S. aureus (MRSA)&#8208;infected wounds, simultaneously eradicating MRSA pathogens and accelerating wound healing.

Although metal carbonyls show a broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, it remains unclear whether the bactericidal property originates from the transition metals or the released CO. Here, we develop nonmetallic CO-releasing micelles via a photooxygenation mechanism of 3-hydroxyflavone derivatives, enabling CO release under red light irradiation (e.g., 650&#8197;nm).

         <title>Light&#8208;Controlled Tyrosine Nitration of Proteins</title>

A simple yet effective dinitroimidazole reagent for light&#8208;controlled nitration of tyrosine residues in peptides and proteins was developed.







Abstract
Tyrosine nitration of proteins is one of the most important oxidative post&#8208;translational modifications in vivo. A major obstacle for its biochemical and physiological studies is the lack of efficient and chemoselective protein tyrosine nitration reagents. Herein, we report a generalizable strategy for light&#8208;controlled protein tyrosine nitration by employing biocompatible dinitroimidazole reagents. Upon 390&#8197;nm irradiation, dinitroimidazoles efficiently convert tyrosine residues into 3&#8208;nitrotyrosine residues in peptides and proteins with fast kinetics and high chemoselectivity under neutral aqueous buffer conditions. The incorporation of 3&#8208;nitrotyrosine residues enhances the thermostability of lasso peptide natural products and endows murine tumor necrosis factor&#8208;&#945; with strong immunogenicity to break self&#8208;tolerance. The light&#8208;controlled time resolution of this method allows the investigation of the impact of tyrosine nitration on the self&#8208;assembly behavior of &#945;&#8208;synuclein.

         <title>Assembly of a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework (MOF) Membrane on a Solid Electrocatalyst: Introducing Molecular&#8208;Level Control Over Heterogeneous CO2 Reduction</title>

Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) assembled on a solid electrocatalyst can act as porous membrane to tune the active site's immediate chemical environment, leading to improved electrocatalytic performance and selectivity. A UiO&#8208;66 MOF&#8208;membrane enhances CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO catalysis when grown over Ag. It stabilizes reactive intermediates and attenuates reactant's mass transport.







Abstract
Electrochemically active Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have been progressively recognized for their use in solar fuel production schemes. Typically, they are utilized as platforms for heterogeneous tethering of exceptionally large concentration of molecular electrocatalysts onto electrodes. Yet so far, the potential influence of their extraordinary chemical modularity on electrocatalysis has been overlooked. Herein, we demonstrate that, when assembled on a solid Ag CO2 reduction electrocatalyst, a non&#8208;catalytic UiO&#8208;66 MOF acts as a porous membrane that systematically tunes the active site's immediate chemical environment, leading to a drastic enhancement of electrocatalytic activity and selectivity. Electrochemical analysis shows that the MOF membrane improves catalytic performance through physical and electrostatic regulation of reactants delivery towards the catalytic sites. The MOF also stabilizes catalytic intermediates via modulation of active site's secondary coordination sphere. This concept can be expanded to a wide range of proton&#8208;coupled electrochemical reactions, providing new means for precise, molecular&#8208;level manipulation of heterogeneous solar fuels systems.

         <title>Macrocyclic FKBP51 Ligands Define a Transient Binding Mode with Enhanced Selectivity</title>

Macrocyclic FKBP51 ligands reveal a new transient binding pocket for the FK506&#8208;binding protein&#8197;51 and enable the first ligands that also discriminate against the close homologs FKBP12 and FKBP12.6. This macrocyclic motif represents a new scaffold to develop drugs for depression, obesity or chronic pain.







Abstract
Subtype selectivity represents a challenge in many drug discovery campaigns. A typical example is the FK506 binding protein&#8197;51 (FKBP51), which has emerged as an attractive drug target. The most advanced FKBP51 ligands of the SAFit class are highly selective vs. FKBP52 but poorly discriminate against the homologs and off&#8208;targets FKBP12 and FKBP12.6. During a macrocyclization pilot study, we observed that many of these macrocyclic analogs have unanticipated and unprecedented preference for FKBP51 over FKBP12 and FKBP12.6. Structural studies revealed that these macrocycles bind with a new binding mode featuring a transient conformation, which is disfavored for the small FKBPs. Using a conformation&#8208;sensitive assay we show that this binding mode occurs in solution and is characteristic for this new class of compounds. The discovered macrocycles are non&#8208;immunosuppressive, engage FKBP51 in cells, and block the cellular effect of FKBP51 on IKK&#945;. Our findings provide a new chemical scaffold for improved FKBP51 ligands and the structural basis for enhanced selectivity.

         <title>The Unusual Homodimer of a Heme&#8208;Copper Terminal Oxidase Allows Itself to Utilize Two Electron Donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 24, Page 13323-13330, June 7, 2021. </description>

The 3.4&#8197;&#197; structure of cytochrome c oxidase from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Aquifex aeolicus (AaCcO) has been solved. The molecular mechanism that AaCcO uses involves both cytochrome c and quinol as electron donors through the native quinol molecules (NQs) bound at the dimeric interface.







Abstract
The heme&#8208;copper oxidase superfamily comprises cytochrome c and ubiquinol oxidases. These enzymes catalyze the transfer of electrons from different electron donors onto molecular oxygen. A B&#8208;family cytochrome c oxidase from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Aquifex aeolicus was discovered previously to be able to use both cytochrome c and naphthoquinol as electron donors. Its molecular mechanism as well as the evolutionary significance are yet unknown. Here we solved its 3.4&#8197;&#197; resolution electron cryo&#8208;microscopic structure and discovered a novel dimeric structure mediated by subunit I (CoxA2) that would be essential for naphthoquinol binding and oxidation. The unique structural features in both proton and oxygen pathways suggest an evolutionary adaptation of this oxidase to its hyperthermophilic environment.

     alt="The Unusual Homodimer of a Heme-Copper Terminal Oxidase Allows Itself to Utilize Two Electron Donors"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3.4&#8197;&#197; structure of cytochrome &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; oxidase from the hyperthermophilic bacterium &lt;i&gt;Aquifex aeolicus&lt;/i&gt; (AaC&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;O) has been solved. The molecular mechanism that AaC&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;O uses involves both cytochrome &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; and quinol as electron donors through the native quinol molecules (NQs) bound at the dimeric interface.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heme-copper oxidase superfamily comprises cytochrome &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; and ubiquinol oxidases. These enzymes catalyze the transfer of electrons from different electron donors onto molecular oxygen. A B-family cytochrome &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; oxidase from the hyperthermophilic bacterium &lt;i&gt;Aquifex aeolicus&lt;/i&gt; was discovered previously to be able to use both cytochrome &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; and naphthoquinol as electron donors. Its molecular mechanism as well as the evolutionary significance are yet unknown. Here we solved its 3.4&#8197;&#197; resolution electron cryo-microscopic structure and discovered a novel dimeric structure mediated by subunit I (CoxA2) that would be essential for naphthoquinol binding and oxidation. The unique structural features in both proton and oxygen pathways suggest an evolutionary adaptation of this oxidase to its hyperthermophilic environment. Our results add a new conceptual understanding of structural variation of cytochrome &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; oxidases in different species.&lt;/p&gt;

A DSN&#8208;assisted ICR&#8208;nanopipette was fabricated for tracking the drug&#8208;induced variation of the oncogenic miR&#8208;10b expression levels of a dynamic manner. This method unveils the ability of electrochemistry to probe intracellular RNA and to study the gene expression and heterogeneous complexity under physiological conditions down to single&#8208;cell level.







Abstract
New tools for single&#8208;cell interrogation enable deeper understanding of cellular heterogeneity and associated cellular behaviors and functions. Information of RNA expression in single cell could contribute to our knowledge of the genetic regulatory circuits and molecular mechanism of disease development. Although significant progresses have been made for intracellular RNA analysis, existing methods have a trade&#8208;off between operational complexity and practical feasibility. We address this challenge by combining the ionic current rectification property of nanopipette reactor with duplex&#8208;specific nuclease&#8208;assisted hybridization chain reaction for signal amplification to realize a simple and practical intracellular nanosensor with minimal invasiveness, which enables single&#8208;cell collection and electrochemical detection of intracellular RNA with cell&#8208;context preservation. Systematic studies on differentiation of oncogenic miR&#8208;10b expression levels in non&#8208;malignant breast cells, metastatic breast cancer cells as well as non&#8208;metastatic breast cancer cells were then realized by this nanotool accompanied by assessment of different drugs effects. This work has unveiled the ability of electrochemistry to probe intracellular RNA and opened new opportunities to study the gene expression and heterogeneous complexity under physiological conditions down to single&#8208;cell level.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Efficient Hydroxylation of Benzene to Phenol by Quinolinium and Polyoxovanadate&#8208;Based Supramolecular Catalysts</title>

The readily available series green V supramolecular catalysts can catalyze the hydroxylation of benzene to phenol with high conversion, selectivity and atom efficiency.







Abstract
Direct Hydroxylation of benzene to phenol with high yield and selectivity has been the goal of phenol industrial production. Photocatalysis can serve as a competitive method to realize the hydroxylation of benzene to phenol owing to its cost&#8208;effective and environmental friendliness, however it is still a forbidding challenge to obtain good yield, high selectivity and high atom availability meanwhile. Here we show a series of supramolecular catalysts based on alkoxohexavanadate anions and quinolinium ions for the photocatalytic hydroxylation of benzene to phenol under UV irradiation. We demonstrate that polyoxoalkoxovanadates can serve as efficient catalysts which can not only stabilize quinolinium radicals but also reuse H2O2 produced by quinolinium ions under light irradiation to obtain excellent synergistic effect, including competitive good yield (50.1&#8201;%), high selectivity (&gt;99&#8201;%) and high atom availability.

Rhodium&#8208;electrocatalyzed C&#8722;H oxygenations of amides and ketones proved viable under mild conditions via bimetallic electrocatalysis. Mechanistic studies revealed a high&#8208;valent dimeric rhodium electrocatalysis.







Abstract
Rhodium&#8208;electrocatalyzed arene C&#8722;H oxygenation by weakly O&#8208;coordinating amides and ketones have been established by bimetallic electrocatalysis. Likewise, diverse dihydrooxazinones were selectively accessed by the judicious choice of current, enabling twofold C&#8722;H functionalization. Detailed mechanistic studies by experiment, mass spectroscopy and cyclovoltammetric analysis provided support for an unprecedented electrooxidation&#8208;induced C&#8722;H activation by a bimetallic rhodium catalysis manifold.

Abstract
We reply to the comment by J.&#8208;M. Mewes, A. Hansen and S. Grimme (MHG), who challenged the accuracy of our re value for the N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te distance in (C6F5)Te(CH2)3NMe2 determined by gas electron diffraction (GED). We conclusively demonstrate that MHG&#8242;s quoted reference calculations are less accurate than they claim for solid state and gas phase. We show by higher level calculations, that we did not miss substantial contributions from open&#8208;chain conformers. Refinements on simulated scattering data show that such contributions would have had only an almost negligible effect on re(N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te). MHG suggested the use of a H0&#8208;tuned GFN method for calculating vibrational corrections ra&#8722;re, but this did not change these values substantially. Alternative amplitude calculations using higher level analytic harmonic and numeric cubic force fields (PBE0&#8208;D3BJ/def2&#8208;TZVP) yield a GED value for re(N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te)=2.852(25)&#8197;&#197; that is well within the experimental error of our original value 2.918(31)&#8197;&#197; but far from the 2.67(8)&#8197;&#197; predicted by MHG. A now improved error estimation accounts for inaccuracies in the calculated auxiliary values. The gas/solid difference of the weak N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te interaction is in a realistic range compared to other systems involving weak chemical interactions.

Abstract
Mitzel and co&#8208;workers recently presented an intriguing molecule displaying a tellurium&#8211;nitrogen interaction. Structural data obtained in the solid and in gas phase indicated a large increase of the Te&#8211;N equilibrium distance re from 2.64 to 2.92&#8197;&#197;, respectively. Although some DFT calculations appear to support the large re in gas phase, we argue that the lions share of the increase is due to an incomplete description of finite&#8208;temperature effects in the back&#8208;corrected experimental data. This hypothesis is based on high&#8208;level coupled&#8208;cluster (CC) and periodic DFT calculations, which consistently point towards a much smaller re in the isolated molecule. Further support comes through MD simulations with a tuned GFN2&#8208;xTB Hamiltonian: Calibrated against a CC reference, these show a six&#8208;times larger influence of temperature than with the originally used GFN1&#8208;xTB. Taking this into account, the back&#8208;corrected re in gas phase becomes 2.67&#177;0.08&#8197;&#197;, in good agreement with high&#8208;level CC theory and most DFT methods.

A supramolecular coordination cage in the center of a star&#8208;shaped water&#8208;soluble polymer responds to ultrasonication&#8208;induced shear force in solution. As reported by Robert G&#246;stl, Bernd&#8197;M. Schmidt, and co&#8208;workers in their Communication on page&#8197;13626, the octahedral Pd cage (blue panels) bearing polymer chains (red) on each vertex (metallic) encapsulates pharmaceutically active cargo within its hydrophobic nanocavity and is activated by sonication in aqueous solution, with complete cargo release upon rupture.

Designed hydrogen bonds in the active site of terpene cyclases enable the control of cationic cyclization cascades by molecular anchoring of a substrate's polar functional group. As a result, it is possible to replace multi&#8208;step synthetic routes by one enzymatic step and manufacture valuable apocarotenoids in a highly product&#8208; and stereoselective manner on gram scale, as reported by Bernhard Hauer and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;13251.

A novel class of genetically encoded fluorescent sensors for detecting opioid molecules is reported by Kayla&#8197;E. Kroning and Wenjing Wang in their Research Article on page&#8197;13358. These opioid sensors are called SPOTIT (single&#8208;chain protein&#8208;based opioid transmission indicator tool). Upon detecting opioids, SPOTIT is activated and generates a persistent green fluorescence mark for image analysis. SPOTIT will potentially be useful for high&#8208;throughput screening of opioids in cell cultures and cellular resolution detection of opioids in&#8197;vivo.

The change of the potential of zero charge (pzc) of a single layer graphene (SLG) electrode in contact with EMI,TFSI ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;based electrolyte is reported by Yanwu Zhu, Patrice Simon, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;13317. The strong interactions between the SLG surface and the EMI+ cation (red) in neat ionic liquid are weakened in the presence of acetonitrile solvent molecules (yellow), leading to an increase in the charge carrier density at the electrolyte/SLG interface and a positive shift of the pzc.

         <title>Biopolymer&#8208;based Carriers for DNA Vaccine Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 24, Page 13225-13243, June 7, 2021. </description>

Recently, the first genetic vaccine has been approved to tackle the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. Despite their favourable properties, low transfection efficacies prevent many nucleic acid vaccines from being approved for human use. This Review explores strategies that use biopolymeric delivery systems to improve the efficacy of DNA immunisation.







Abstract
Over the last 30&#8197;years, genetically engineered DNA has been tested as novel vaccination strategy against various diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, several parasites, and cancers. However, the clinical breakthrough of the technique is confined by the low transfection efficacy and immunogenicity of the employed vaccines. Therefore, carrier materials were designed to prevent the rapid degradation and systemic clearance of DNA in the body. In this context, biopolymers are a particularly promising DNA vaccine carrier platform due to their beneficial biochemical and physical characteristics, including biocompatibility, stability, and low toxicity. This article reviews the applications, fabrication, and modification of biopolymers as carrier medium for genetic vaccines.

Research on micro/nanomotors has been booming in the past two decades, and their applications in the biomedical field have also received increasing attention. This Minireview summarizes research progress in the biosafety, functionality, and therapeutic effect of micro/nanomotors that can be used to treat different diseases. The direction of future developments is also discussed.







Abstract
Due to their unique ability to actively move, micro/nanomotors offer the possibility of breaking through the limitations of traditional passive drug delivery systems for the treatment of many diseases, and have attracted the increasing attention of researchers. However, at present, the realization of many advantages of micro/nanomotors in disease treatment in vivo is still in its infancy, because of the complexity and particularity of diseases in different parts of human body. In this Minireview, we first focus on the biosafety and functionality of micro/nanomotors as a biomedical treatment system. Then, we address the treatment difficulties of various diseases in vivo (such as ophthalmic disease, orthopedic disease, gastrointestinal disease, cardiovascular disease, and cancer), and then review the research progress of biomedical micro/nanomotors in the past 20&#8197;years, Finally, we propose the challenges in this field and possible future development directions

This Review summarizes the recent developments of atomically dispersed reactive centers for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction and water splitting. The catalytic mechanisms and the underlying structure&#8211;activity relationships are well elaborated based on the recent progress from the operando investigations.







Abstract
Developing electrocatalytic energy conversion technologies for replacing the traditional energy source is highly expected to resolve the fossil fuel exhaustion and related environmental problems. Exploring stable and high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts is of vital importance for the promotion of these technologies. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), with atomically distributed active sites on supports, perform as emerging materials in catalysis and present promising prospects for a wide range of applications. The rationally designed near&#8208;range coordination environment, long&#8208;range electronic interaction and microenvironment of the coordination sphere cast huge influence on the reaction mechanism and related catalytic performance of SACs. In the current Review, some recent developments of atomically dispersed reactive centers for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction and water splitting are well summarized. The catalytic mechanism and the underlying structure&#8211;activity relationship are elaborated based on the recent progresses of various operando investigations. Finally, by highlighting the challenges and prospects for the development of single&#8208;atom catalysis, we hope to shed some light on the future research of SACs for the electrocatalytic energy conversion.

         <title>Chiral Cyclopentadienyl Ligands: Design, Syntheses, and Applications in Asymmetric Catalysis</title>

Chiral cyclopentadienyls (CpX) have emerged as powerful steering ligands in asymmetric catalysis. This Review discusses the existing ligand classes, their design, syntheses, and metalation methods. Details on the successful application of the metal complexes in numerous catalytic processes are provided. Those include C&#8722;H bond functionalization chemistry and beyond, enabling access to valuable chiral molecules.







Abstract
The creation of new chiral ligands capable of providing high stereocontrol in metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions is crucial in modern organic synthesis. The production of bioactive molecules as single enantiomers is increasingly required, and asymmetric catalysis with metal complexes constitutes one of the most efficient synthetic strategies to access optically active compounds. Herein we offer a historical overview on the development of chiral derivatives of the ubiquitous cyclopentadienyl ligand (CpX), and detail their successful application in a broad range of metal&#8208;catalyzed transformations. Those include the functionalization of challenging C&#8722;H bonds and beyond, giving access to an extensive catalogue of valuable chiral molecules. A critical comparison of the existing ligand families, their design, synthesis, and complexation to different metals is also provided. In addition, future research directions are discussed to further enhance the performance and application of CpX ligands in enantioselective catalysis.

Structure&#8208;activity relationship analysis of Hedgehog acyltransferase (HHAT) inhibitors allowed rational design of photochemical probes for HHAT. Probe photocrosslinking identified the first small&#8208;molecule inhibitor binding site in HHAT and revealed the inhibitory mechanism, providing an optimal HHAT tool inhibitor IMP&#8208;1575 (Ki=38&#8197;nM) for future studies.







Abstract
The mammalian membrane&#8208;bound O&#8208;acyltransferase (MBOAT) superfamily is involved in biological processes including growth, development and appetite sensing. MBOATs are attractive drug targets in cancer and obesity; however, information on the binding site and molecular mechanisms underlying small&#8208;molecule inhibition is elusive. This study reports rational development of a photochemical probe to interrogate a novel small&#8208;molecule inhibitor binding site in the human MBOAT Hedgehog acyltransferase (HHAT). Structure&#8208;activity relationship investigation identified single enantiomer IMP&#8208;1575, the most potent HHAT inhibitor reported to&#8208;date, and guided design of photocrosslinking probes that maintained HHAT&#8208;inhibitory potency. Photocrosslinking and proteomic sequencing of HHAT delivered identification of the first small&#8208;molecule binding site in a mammalian MBOAT. Topology and homology data suggested a potential mechanism for HHAT inhibition which was confirmed by kinetic analysis. Our results provide an optimal HHAT tool inhibitor IMP&#8208;1575 (Ki=38&#8197;nM) and a strategy for mapping small molecule interaction sites in MBOATs.

         <title>Mechanochemical Release of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes from Flex&#8208;Activated Mechanophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 24, Page 13559-13563, June 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new kind of flex&#8208;activated mechanophore, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8211;carbodiimide adduct (NHC&#8208;CDI), was developed as a platform to release different NHCs under mechanical load. The polymeric materials containing NHC&#8208;CDI can be subjected to multiple compression cycles and successively release NHCs, which have potential to be utilized as self&#8208;healing, self&#8208;strengthening and self&#8208;reporting materials.







Abstract
We have discovered a new flex&#8208;activated mechanophore that releases an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) under mechanical load. The mechanophore design is based upon NHC&#8208;carbodiimide (NHC&#8208;CDI) adducts and demonstrates an important first step toward flex&#8208;activated designs capable of further downstream reactivities. Since the flex&#8208;activation is non&#8208;destructive to the main polymer chains, the material can be subjected to multiple compression cycles to achieve iterative increases in the activation percentage of mechanophores. Two different NHC structures were demonstrated, signifying the potential modularity of the mechanophore design.

         <title>Unified Synthesis of Polycyclic Alkaloids by Complementary Carbonyl Activation**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 24, Page 13591-13596, June 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient construction of polycyclic scaffolds of bioactive alkaloids by a novel annulation strategy enabled the synthesis of several natural products, including the dimeric berberine alkaloid ilicifoline&#8197;B (see scheme). This versatile approach also served as the basis for a protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free synthesis of (+)&#8208; and (&#8722;)&#8208;peganumine&#8197;A featuring an asymmetric disulfonimide&#8208;catalyzed cyclization cascade.







Abstract
A complementary dual carbonyl activation strategy for the synthesis of polycyclic alkaloids has been developed. Successful applications include the synthesis of tetracyclic alkaloids harmalanine and harmalacinine, pentacyclic indoloquinolizidine alkaloid nortetoyobyrine, and octacyclic &#946;&#8208;carboline alkaloid peganumine&#8197;A. The latter synthesis features a protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free assembly and an asymmetric disulfonimide&#8208;catalyzed cyclization. Furthermore, formal syntheses of hirsutine, deplancheine, 10&#8208;desbromoarborescidine&#8197;A, and oxindole alkaloids rhynchophylline and isorhynchophylline have been achieved. Finally, a concise synthesis of berberine alkaloid ilicifoline&#8197;B was completed.

         <title>LiZn(OH)CO3: A Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Hydroxycarbonate Designed from a Diamond&#8208;like Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 24, Page 13574-13578, June 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first DUV NLO hydroxycarbonate LiZn(OH)CO3 was obtained by structural design. LiZn(OH)CO3 exhibits a large SHG response, a wide band gap and a large birefringence, achieving the shortest phase&#8208;matching wavelength among all reported NLO carbonates.







Abstract
Deep&#8208;ultraviolet (DUV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals are vital to the development of science and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art technologies, but the exploration of these important optoelectronic materials is hindered by the contradiction between NLO effect and energy band gap as well as the sensitivity of DUV phase&#8208;matching to optical birefringence. Here, in order to achieve a well balanced DUV NLO performance, we chose the diamond&#8208;like structure as the prototype template for the material design and synthesized the first DUV NLO hydroxycarbonate crystal, LiZn(OH)CO3. This compound simultaneously has a wide band gap (&gt;6.53&#8197;eV), a strong second harmonic generation response (ca. 3.2&#215;KDP), and a large birefringence (0.147 at 1064&#8197;nm) with the shortest DUV phase&#8208;matching capability (&#955;PM&lt;190&#8197;nm) among all reported NLO carbonates. Moreover, the structure&#8211;property relationships in LiZn(OH)CO3 are analyzed by first&#8208;principles calculations. This work presents an effective design strategy to push the NLO performance of hydroxycarbonates into the DUV region.

         <title>Synthesis of Ionic Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks through Quaternization&#8208;Activated Knoevenagel Condensation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 24, Page 13614-13620, June 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic, vinylene&#8208;linked, two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were synthesized by reticulating 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylpyridinium salts with multi&#8208;topic aromatic aldehyde derivatives through a quaternization&#8208;promoted Knoevenagel condensation. The quaternization of pyridine activates the attached methyl groups and charges the framework simultaneously.







Abstract
We developed a simple approach to synthesizing ionic vinylene&#8208;linked two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) through a quaternization&#8208;promoted Knoevenagel condensation at three aromatic methyl carbon atoms of N&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylpyridinium halide with multitopic aromatic aldehyde derivatives. The resultant COFs exhibited a honeycomb&#8208;like structure with high crystallinity and surface areas as large as 1343&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1. The regular shape&#8208;persistent nanochannels and the positively charged polymeric frameworks allowed the COFs to be uniformly composited with linear polyethylene oxide and lithium salt, displaying ionic conductivity as high as 2.72&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1.

The quaternization of pyridine activates the attached methyl groups and charges the framework simultaneously.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We developed a simple approach to synthesizing ionic vinylene-linked two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) through a quaternization-promoted Knoevenagel condensation at three aromatic methyl carbon atoms of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-ethyl-2,4,6-trimethylpyridinium halide with multitopic aromatic aldehyde derivatives. The resultant COFs exhibited a honeycomb-like structure with high crystallinity and surface areas as large as 1343&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The regular shape-persistent nanochannels and the positively charged polymeric frameworks allowed the COFs to be uniformly composited with linear polyethylene oxide and lithium salt, displaying ionic conductivity as high as 2.72&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Polymorphism and Fast Potassium&#8208;Ion Conduction in the T5 Supertetrahedral Phosphidosilicate KSi2P3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 24, Page 13641-13646, June 7, 2021. </description>

Size matters: Only a structure with large T5 supertetrahedra enables fast K+&#8208;ion conduction in the polymorphic phosphidosilicate KSi2P3.







Abstract
The all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery (ASSB) is a promising candidate for electrochemical energy storage. In view of the limited availability of lithium, however, alternative systems based on earth&#8208;abundant and inexpensive elements are urgently sought. Besides well&#8208;studied sodium compounds, potassium&#8208;based systems offer the advantage of low cost and a large electrochemical window, but are hardly explored. Here we report the synthesis and crystal structure of K&#8208;ion conducting T5 KSi2P3 inspired by recent discoveries of fast ion conductors in alkaline phosphidosilicates. KSi2P3 is composed of SiP4 tetrahedra forming interpenetrating networks of large T5 supertetrahedra. The compound passes through a reconstructive phase transition from the known T3 to the new tetragonal T5 polymorph at 1020&#8201;&#176;C with enantiotropic displacive phase transitions upon cooling at about 155&#8201;&#176;C and 80&#8201;&#176;C. The potassium ions are located in large channels between the T5 supertetrahedral networks and show facile movement through the structure. The bulk ionic conductivity is up to 2.6&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C with an average activation energy of 0.20&#8197;eV. This is remarkably high for a potassium ion conductor at room temperature, and marks KSi2P3 as the first non&#8208;oxide solid potassium ion conductor.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Fluoroalkylation of Arylborates with Sulfone Reagents: Beyond the Limitation of Reduction Potential</title>

The coordination of low&#8208;valent iron to the nitrogen atom of N&#8208;heteroaryl sulfones can overcome the reduction potential limitation in intermolecular electron&#8208;transfer processes, thus enabling sulfones with low reduction potentials to efficiently participate in radical cross&#8208;coupling.







Abstract
The iron&#8208;catalyzed alkyl&#8211;aryl coupling reaction between sulfones and arylboron compounds has remained a challenge. We report the first iron&#8208;catalyzed radical difluoroalkylation of arylborates with N&#8208;heteroaryl sulfones. The coordination between the iron catalyst and the nitrogen atom of N&#8208;heteroaryl sulfones was identified to be important in overcoming the reduction potential limitation of sulfones in the intermolecular single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer process, which enables both fluoroalkyl N&#8208;heteroaryl sulfones (with relatively high reduction potentials) and nonfluorinated alkyl N&#8208;heteroaryl sulfones (with low reduction potentials) to serve as powerful alkylation reagents.

The first examples of Lewis base adducts of the parent boraphosphaketene (H2B&#8722;PCO) are prepared, and their dimerization, decarbonylation and use as synthons for phosphinidenes is explored, leading to a number of different B/P&#8208;containing heterocycles and transition&#8208;metal complexes thereof.







Abstract
The first examples of Lewis base adducts of the parent boraphosphaketene (H2B&#8208;PCO) and their cyclodimers are prepared. One of these adducts is shown to undergo mild decarbonylation and phosphinidene insertion into a B&#8722;C bond of a borole, forming very rare examples of 1,2&#8208;phosphaborinines, B/P isosteres of benzene. The strong donor properties of these 1,2&#8208;phosphaborinines are confirmed by the synthesis of their &#960;&#8197;complexes with the Group&#8197;6 metals.

         <title>The Metallocene Battery: Ultrafast Electron Transfer Self Exchange Rate Accompanied by a Harmonic Height Breathing</title>

An all&#8208;metallocene battery consisting of poly&#8208;ferrocene and poly&#8208;cobaltocene is shown. The extremely high power density is provided via molecular self&#8208;assembly between polymers and reduced graphene oxide. The precise construction of anode and cathode results in a reciprocal height change during charging&#8211;discharging, due to anion (de)intercalation in the soft structure.







Abstract
The first all&#8208;metallocene rechargeable battery consisting of poly&#8208;cobaltocenium/&#8208; and poly&#8208;ferrocene/reduced graphene oxide composites as anode and cathode was prepared. The intrinsically fast ET self&#8208;exchange rate of metallocenes was successfully combined with an efficient ion&#8208;percolation achieved by molecular self&#8208;assembly. The resulting battery materials show ideal Nernstian behavior, is thickness scalable up to &gt;1.2&#8197;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and exhibit high coulombic efficiency at ultrafast rates (200&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). Using aqueous LiClO4, the charge is carried exclusively by the anion. The ClO4&#8722; intercalation is accompanied by a reciprocal height change of the active layers. Principally, volume changes in organic battery materials during charging/discharging are not desirable and represent a major safety issue. However, here, the individual height changes&#8212;due to ion breathing&#8212;are reciprocal and thus prohibiting any internal pressure build&#8208;up in the closed&#8208;cell, leading to excellent cycling stability.

A new mode of activation of sulfonium salts by &#945;&#8208;amino alkyl radicals is reported. The C&#8722;S bond of the aryl sulfonium salt is cleaved by the action of &#945;&#8208;amino alkyl radicals in the absence of light and photoredox catalysis. The methodology enables a late&#8208;stage heteroarylation of hetero(aryl) sulfonium salts.







Abstract
We report a late&#8208;stage heteroarylation of aryl sulfonium salts through activation with &#945;&#8208;amino alkyl radicals in a mechanistically distinct approach from previously reported halogen&#8208;atom transfer (XAT). The new mode of activation of aryl sulfonium salts proceeds in the absence of light and photoredox catalysts, engaging a wide range of hetarenes. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of this methodology in synthetically useful cross&#8208;coupling transformations.

         <title>Access to Functionalized Pyrenes, Peropyrenes, Terropyrenes, and Quarterropyrenes via Reductive Aromatization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 24, Page 13631-13635, June 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach for the modular synthesis of peropyrenes, terropyrenes, and quarterropyrenes via reductive aromatization and silylation key steps is presented. The functionalized members of the ropyrene family are characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography and 13C&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. Optical spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry are discussed in relation to DFT&#8208;calculated frontier molecular orbital energies.







Abstract
Herein we report a versatile concept for the synthesis of fourfold functionalized, soluble pyrenes, peropyrenes, terropyrenes, and quarterropyrenes. They were obtained by a modular stepwise approach towards the rylene scaffold via Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross coupling, oxidative cyclodehydrogenation in the presence of caesium hydroxide under air, and finally zinc&#8208;mediated reductive silylation. The silylated reaction products were characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The first example of a synthesized and crystallized quarterropyrene is presented and its oxidation reaction investigated. The functionalized ropyrenes were systematically characterized by means of UV/Vis&#8211;NIR and photoluminescence spectroscopy showing a bathochromic shift of 80&#8197;nm per naphthalene unit and a nearly linear increase of the extinction coefficients. Cyclic voltammograms and DFT calculations identify them as electron&#8208;rich dyes and show a narrowing of the electrochemically determined HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap and lower oxidation potentials for the higher homologues.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Diastereoselective, Complete Hydrogenation of Benzofurans by Cascade Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 24, Page 13677-13681, June 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot cascade catalytic hydrogenation is developed producing enantioenriched octahydrobenzofurans with up to six new stereocenters. The dual catalytic, sequential process is enabled by a unique match of a chiral ruthenium carbene catalyst and an achiral rhodium catalyst, which is generated in situ upon adjustment of the reaction conditions.







Abstract
We report an enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective, complete hydrogenation of multiply substituted benzofurans in a one&#8208;pot cascade catalysis. The developed protocol facilitates the controlled installation of up to six new defined stereocenters and produces architecturally complex octahydrobenzofurans, prevalent in many bioactive molecules. A unique match of a chiral homogeneous ruthenium&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complex and an in situ activated rhodium catalyst from a complex precursor act in sequence to enable the presented process.

         <title>Self&#8208;Sorting in Dynamic Combinatorial Libraries Leads to the Co&#8208;Existence of Foldamers and Self&#8208;Replicators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 24, Page 13569-13573, June 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two different dithiol building blocks interconvert through reversible covalent bonds to initially form a dynamic combinatorial library of macrocycles of various size. The self&#8208;sorting process starts by the amplification of a single library member to form self&#8208;replicating fibers. This step is followed by enrichment of the system in the remaining building block, which forms a large macrocyclic foldamer.







Abstract
Nature segregates fundamental tasks such as information storage/transmission and catalysis between two different compound classes (e.g. polynucleotides for replication and folded polyamides for catalysis). This division of labor is likely a product of evolution, raising the question of how simpler systems in which replicators and folded macromolecules co&#8208;exist may emerge in the transition from chemistry to biology. In synthetic systems, achieving co&#8208;existence of replicators and foldamers in a single molecular network remains an unsolved problem. Previous work on dynamic molecular networks has given rise to either self&#8208;replicating fibers or well&#8208;defined foldamer structures (or completely un&#8208;sorted complex systems). We report a system in which two cross&#8208;reactive dithiol (nucleobase&#8208; and peptide&#8208;based) building blocks self&#8208;sort into a replicator fiber and foldamer that both emerge spontaneously and co&#8208;exist. The self&#8208;sorting behavior remains prevalent across different building block ratios as two phases of emergence occur: replicator growth followed by foldamer formation. This is attributed to the autocatalytic formation of the replicator fiber, followed by enrichment of the system in the remaining building block, which is subsequently incorporated into a foldamer.

To expand the current portfolio of saturated, fluorinated carbocycles for drug discovery, a main&#8208;group catalysis&#8208;based synthesis of novel, trifluorinated tetralins is disclosed. Isosteric replacement of [CH2&#8722;CH2] by [CF2&#8722;CHF] removes the conformational degeneracy intrinsic to the parent tetralin, since the CH&#8722;F bond occupies a pseudo&#8208;axial orientation (&#963;C&#8722;H&#8594;&#963;C&#8722;F*). This provides pre&#8208;organised module for contemporary medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
Saturated, fluorinated carbocycles are emerging as important modules for contemporary drug discovery. To expand the current portfolio, the synthesis of novel trifluorinated tetralins has been achieved. Fluorinated methyleneindanes serve as convenient precursors and undergo efficient difluorinative ring expansion with in situ generated p&#8208;TolIF2 (&gt;20 examples, up to &gt;95&#8201;%). A range of diverse substituents are tolerated under standard catalysis conditions and this is interrogated by Hammett analysis. X&#8208;ray analysis indicates a preference for the CH&#8722;F bond to occupy a pseudo&#8208;axial orientation, consistent with stabilising &#963;C&#8722;H&#8594;&#963;C&#8722;F* interactions. The replacement of the symmetric [CH2&#8722;CH2] motif by [CF2&#8722;CHF] removes the conformational degeneracy intrinsic to the parent tetralin scaffold leading to a predictable half&#8208;chair. The conformational behavior of this novel structural balance has been investigated by computational analysis and is consistent with stereoelectronic theory.

         <title>Biosynthesis and Mechanism of Action of the Cell Wall Targeting Antibiotic Hypeptin</title>

The nonribosomal peptide hypeptin blocks cell wall biosynthesis of gram&#8208;positive bacteria by binding to lipid II. It kills pathogens even in late exponential growth phase without detectable development of resistance. Investigation of the biosynthesis in vitro, combined with bioinformatic and NMR analyses led to the proposal of a refined structure.







Abstract
Hypeptin is a cyclodepsipeptide antibiotic produced by Lysobacter sp. K5869, isolated from an environmental sample by the iChip technology, dedicated to the cultivation of previously uncultured microorganisms. Hypeptin shares structural features with teixobactin and exhibits potent activity against a broad spectrum of gram&#8208;positive pathogens. Using comprehensive in vivo and in vitro analyses, we show that hypeptin blocks bacterial cell wall biosynthesis by binding to multiple undecaprenyl pyrophosphate&#8208;containing biosynthesis intermediates, forming a stoichiometric 2:1 complex. Resistance to hypeptin did not readily develop in vitro. Analysis of the hypeptin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) supported a model for the synthesis of the octapeptide. Within the BGC, two hydroxylases were identified and characterized, responsible for the stereoselective &#946;&#8208;hydroxylation of four building blocks when bound to peptidyl carrier proteins. In vitro hydroxylation assays corroborate the biosynthetic hypothesis and lead to the proposal of a refined structure for hypeptin.

         <title>Isolation of Neutral, Mono&#8208;, and Dicationic B2P2 Rings by Diphosphorus Addition to a Boron&#8722;Boron Triple Bond</title>

Room temperature P&#8722;P bond addition to an NHC&#8208;stabilised diboryne yielded a four&#8208;membered B2P2 heterocycle, which can be further oxidised to a radical cation and a dication depending on the oxidation reagent and its counterion.







Abstract
The NHC&#8208;stabilised diboryne (B2(SIDep)2; SIDep=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diethylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) undergoes a high&#8208;yielding P&#8722;P bond activation with tetraethyldiphosphine at room temperature to form a B2P2 heterocycle via a diphosphoryldiborene by 1,2&#8208;diphosphination. The heterocycle can be oxidised to a radical cation and a dication, respectively, depending on the oxidant used and its counterion. Starting from the planar, neutral 1,3&#8208;bis(alkylidene)&#8208;1,3&#8208;diborata&#8208;2,4&#8208;diphosphoniocyclobutane, each oxidation step leads to decreased B&#8722;B distances and loss of planarity by cationisation. X&#8208;ray analyses in conjunction with DFT and CASSCF/NEVPT2 calculations reveal closed&#8208;shell singlet, butterfly&#8208;shaped structures for the NHC&#8208;stabilised dicationic B2P2 rings, with their diradicaloid, planar&#8208;ring isomers lying close in energy.

         <title>A Protein&#8208;Binding Molecular Photothermal Agent for Tumor Ablation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 24, Page 13564-13568, June 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protein&#8208;binding molecular photothermal agent was developed for photothermal therapy. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the heat generated by the photothermal agent directly destroyed the intracellular bioactive proteins and induced apoptosis under low power density laser irradiation. The therapeutic effect can be efficiently improved with the protein&#8208;binding strategy.







Abstract
Photothermal therapy usually requires a high power density to activate photothermal agent for effective treatment, which inevitably leads to damage to normal tissues and inflammation in tumor tissues. Herein, we rationally design a protein&#8208;binding strategy to build a molecular photothermal agent for photothermal ablation of tumor. The synthesized photothermal agent can covalently bind to the thiol groups on the intracellular proteins. The heat generated by the photothermal agent directly destroyed the bioactive proteins in the cells, effectively reducing the heat loss and the molecular leakage. Under a low power density of 0.2&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the temperature produced by the photothermal agent was sufficient to induce apoptosis. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that the therapeutic effect of photothermal therapy can be efficiently improved with the protein&#8208;binding strategy.

The mechanochemical conversion of gold(III) complexes with sp&#8208;, sp2&#8208;, sp3&#8208;C,H bond&#8208;containing substrates in a planetary ball mill is reported. The base supported reaction delivers high valued products under solvent&#8208;free and mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
Starting from a [(MeOC^N^C)AuCl] complex as precursor, a direct substitution by C,H&#8208;activation from sp&#8208;, sp2&#8208; or sp3&#8208;C,H&#8208;bonds under basic conditions in a planetary ball mill was achieved. Because of the extraordinary photophysical properties of the target compounds, this protocol provides an easy access to a highly valued complex class. In contrast to existing protocols, no pre&#8208;functionalization of the starting materials is necessary and the use of expensive transition metal catalysts can be avoided, which makes this application appealing also for industrial purposes. In addition the methodology was not restricted to pincer complexes, which was demonstrated by the substitution of chelate type [(tpy)AuCl2] complexes.

The synthesis of &#946;&#8208;lactams from &#945;&#8208;ketoacylsilanes and imines is reported, which proceeds via a [2+2] photochemical cycloaddition with in situ generation of siloxyketene.

Abstract
We report the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;lactams from &#945;&#8208;ketoacylsilanes and imines, which proceeds via a formal [2+2] photochemical cycloaddition with in situ generation of siloxyketene. This mild and operationally simple reaction proceeds in an atom&#8208;economic fashion with broad substrate scope, including aldimines, ketimines, hydrazones, and fused nitrogen heterocycles, affording a variety of important &#946;&#8208;lactams with satisfactory diastereoselectivities in most cases. This reaction also features good functional&#8208;group tolerance, facile scalability and product diversification. Experimental and computational studies suggest that &#945;&#8208;ketoacylsilanes can serve as photochemical precursors by engaging in a 1,3 silicon shift to the distal carbonyl group.

Coassembly of metal complex lipids with DMPC demonstrates a very rare fluid&#8211;fluid phase separation up to 37&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
We demonstrate a fluid&#8211;fluid phase separation in 1,2&#8208;dimyristoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphocholine (DMPC) membranes using a metal complex lipid of type [Mn(L1)] (1; HL1=1&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxybenzamide)&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;formyl&#8208;5&#8208;hexadecyloxybenzylideneamino)ethane). Small amount of 1 produces two separated domains in DMPC, whose phase transition temperatures of lipids (Tc) are both lower than that of the pristine DMPC. Variable temperature fluorescent microscopy for giant&#8208;unilamellar vesicles of DMPC/1 hybrids demonstrates that visible phase separations remain in fluid phases up to 37&#8201;&#176;C, which is clearly over the Tc of DMPC. This provides a new dimension for the application of metal complex lipids toward controlling lipid distributions in fluid membranes.

A facile and generalized approach is reported for the modification of solid surfaces with polymer brushes under ambient conditions: filter paper&#8208;assisted surface&#8208;initiated Cu0&#8208;mediated controlled radical polymerization. A surface&#8208;initiated &#8220;band&#8208;aid&#8221; of the monomer solution wetted filter paper covered with a thin copper plate allows to perform the surface grafting selectively with polymer brushes.







Abstract
We report herein a facile and generalized approach to the modification of solid surfaces with polymer brushes under ambient conditions: filter paper&#8208;assisted surface&#8208;initiated Cu0&#8208;mediated controlled radical polymerization (PSI&#8208;CuCRP). The polymerization solution wetted filter paper is sandwiched between a copper plate and an initiator&#8208;modified substrate, which allows the creation of a surface&#8208;initiated polymerization (SIP) &#8220;band&#8208;aid&#8221; so that everyone can perform the surface grafting selectively with good control over the quality of the polymer brushes employing low concentration and microliter amounts of the monomer solution. The versatility of this method is demonstrated by grafting different homo&#8208;, block&#8208;, and multicomponent polymer brushes by using the same activation system and reaction conditions, the polymerization process can be precisely controlled to yield uniform polymers and show high chain&#8208;end functionality which is exemplified by in situ tetra&#8208;copolymerization. The combination of photolithography and paper cutting enables to prepare arbitrary three&#8208;dimensional patterned polymer brushes on the surface.

         <title>Silicon Tetrakis(trifluoromethanesulfonate): A Simple Neutral Silane Acting as a Soft and Hard Lewis Superacid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 24, Page 13656-13660, June 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The title compound is the first neutral silane acting as a hard and soft Lewis superacid as exemplified by extensive scaling. Its distinct reactivity towards soft Lewis bases&#8197;L leads to unprecedented [L2Si(OTf)4] complexes, while the reactions with halocarbons afford electrophilic cations, including a straight access to benzoylium cations from mono&#8208; and bis(trifluoromethyl)benzenes, stabilized by the [Si(OTf)6]2&#8722; weakly coordinating dianion.







Abstract
A facile synthesis and isolation of pristine silicon tetrakis(trifluoromethanesulfonate), Si(OTf)4, is reported, acting as the first neutral silicon&#8208;based Lewis superacid suitable towards soft and hard Lewis bases. Its OTf groups have a dual function: they are excellent leaving groups and modulate the degree of reactivity towards soft and hard Lewis bases. Exposed to soft Lewis donors, Si(OTf)4 leads to [L2Si(OTf)4] complexes (L=isocyanide, thioether and carbonyl compounds) with retention of all Si&#8722;OTf bonds. In contrast, it can cleave C&#8722;X bonds (X=F, Cl) of hard organic Lewis bases with a high tendency to form SiX4 (X=F, Cl) after halide/triflate exchange. Most notable, Si(OTf)4 allows a gentle oxydefluorination of mono&#8208; and bis(trifluoromethyl)benzenes, resulting in the formation of the corresponding benzoylium species, which are stabilized by the weakly coordinating [Si(OTf)6] dianion.

Bright organic&#8211;inorganic metal halides of (DTA)2SbCl5&#8901;DTAC (DTAC=dodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride) with near unity photoluminescence quantum yields are reported. Tuning of the organic groups associated with these hybrid materials brought about changes to their 1D and 2D morphology. The anisotropic structures demonstrated polarized emission and may be applied as low&#8208;loss waveguides.







Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic metal&#8208;halide materials (OIMMs) with zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) structures offer useful optical properties with a wide range of applications. However, successful examples of 0D structural OIMMs with well&#8208;defined optical performance at the micro&#8208;/nanometer scale are limited. We prepared one&#8208;dimensional (1D) (DTA)2SbCl5&#8901;DTAC (DTAC=dodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride) single&#8208;crystal microrods and 2D microplates with a 0D structure in which individual (SbCl5)2&#8722; quadrangular units are completely isolated and surrounded by the organic cation DTA+. The organic molecular unit with a long alkyl chain (C12) and three methyl groups enables microrod and &#8208;plate formation. The single&#8208;crystal microrods/&#8208;plates exhibit a broadband orange emission peak at 610&#8197;nm with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of ca. 90&#8201;% and a large Stokes shift of 260&#8197;nm under photoexcitation. The broad emission originates from self&#8208;trapping excitons. Spatially resolved PL spectra confirm that these microrods exhibit an optical waveguide effect with a low loss coefficient (0.0019&#8197;dB&#8201;&#956;m&#8722;1) during propagation, and linear polarized photoemission with a polarization contrast (0.57).

A neutral open&#8208;shell carbon nanoring was achieved by integration of the phenalenyl unit into the cycloparaphenylene framework. It is shown that the spin distribution and reactivity of this hydrocarbon in the shape of a diamond ring are a result of steric and electronic effects and that selective dimerization yields a double nanohoop with a radial&#8208;planar&#8208;radial arrangement of its three &#960;&#8208;conjugated segments comprising a total of 158&#8197;sp2&#8208;carbon atoms.







Abstract
The first example of a neutral spin&#8208;delocalized carbon&#8208;nanoring radical was achieved by integration of the open&#8208;shell phenalenyl unit into cycloparaphenylene (CPP). Spin distribution in this hydrocarbon is localized primarily on the phenalenyl segment and partially on the CPP segment as a consequence of steric and electronic effects. The resulting geometry is reminiscent of a diamond ring, with pseudo&#8208;perpendicular arrangement of the radial and the planar &#960;&#8208;surface. The phenylene rings attached directly to the phenalenyl unit give rise to a steric effect that governs a highly selective dimerization pathway, yielding a giant double nanohoop. Its &#960;&#8208;framework made of 158&#8197;sp2&#8208;carbon atoms was elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, which revealed a three&#8208;segment CPP&#8208;peropyrene&#8208;CPP structure. This nanocarbon shows a fluorescence profile characteristic of peropyrene, regardless of which segment gets excited. These results in conjunction with DFT suggest that adjusting the size of the CPP segments in this double nanohoop could deliver donor&#8211;acceptor systems.

         <title>NORD: NO Relaxation Delay NMR Spectroscopy</title>

NORD (NO relaxation delay) NMR spectroscopy is introduced and combined with concatenation of experiments in a way making relaxation delays unnecessary and thus enhancing overall sensitivity.







Abstract
The novel concept of NORD (NO relaxation delay) NMR spectroscopy is introduced. The idea is to design concatenated experiments in a way that the magnetization used in the first relaxes toward equilibrium during the second and vice versa, thus saving instrument time. Applications include complete well&#8208;resolved 1H&#8208;1H and 1H&#8208;13C one&#8208;bond and long&#8208;range correlation maps of an 80&#8197;mM solution of a trisaccharide recorded in less than two minutes and hydrocortisone with extensive spectral overlap.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Regioconvergent Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) Cross&#8208;Coupling of Allylic Electrophiles Steered by a Silyl Group</title>

A nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of regioisomeric mixtures of racemic silylated allylic halides and primary alkylzinc reagents enables the enantio&#8208; and regioconvergent synthesis of vinylsilanes with an allylic stereocenter. The silyl group controls the regiochemical outcome and is at the same time a placeholder for another alkyl substituent that can be installed in a subsequent cross&#8208;coupling.







Abstract
A two&#8208;step sequence for the enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective synthesis of exclusively alkyl&#8208;substituted acyclic allylic systems with a stereocenter in the allylic position is reported. The asymmetric induction and the site selectivity are controlled in an enantio&#8208; and regioconvergent nickel&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) cross&#8208;coupling of regioisomeric mixtures of racemic &#945;&#8208;/&#947;&#8208;silylated allylic halides and primary alkylzinc reagents. The silyl group steers the allylic displacement towards the formation of the vinylsilane regioisomer, and the resulting C(sp2)&#8722;Si bond serves as a linchpin for the installation of various C(sp3) substituents in a subsequent step.

An octahedral PdII6(TPT)4 cage with polymer chains on each vertex is activated by shear force from ultrasonication in aqueous solution. The metal&#8211;organic cage encapsulates progesterone or ibuprofen within its hydrophobic nanocavity and shows complete cargo release upon rupture.







Abstract
Supramolecular coordination cages show a wide range of useful properties including, but not limited to, complex molecular machine&#8208;like operations, confined space catalysis, and rich host&#8211;guest chemistries. Here we report the uptake and release of non&#8208;covalently encapsulated, pharmaceutically&#8208;active cargo from an octahedral Pd cage bearing polymer chains on each vertex. Six poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;decorated bipyridine ligands are used to assemble an octahedral PdII6(TPT)4 cage. The supramolecular container encapsulates progesterone and ibuprofen within its hydrophobic nanocavity and is activated by shear force produced by ultrasonication in aqueous solution entailing complete cargo release upon rupture, as shown by NMR and GPC analyses.

         <title>Genetic Engineering in Combination with Semi&#8208;Synthesis Leads to a New Route for Gram&#8208;Scale Production of the Immunosuppressive Natural Product Brasilicardin&#8197;A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 24, Page 13536-13541, June 7, 2021. </description>

The development of a heterologous producer strain that enables the sustainable production of the stereochemically complex natural products brasilicardin&#8197;C and&#8197;E at excellent rates is presented. The semi&#8208;synthetic approach allows an efficient gram&#8208;scale conversion of brasilicardin&#8197;E into the potent immunosuppressant brasilicardin&#8197;A for which the first preclinical data are reported.







Abstract
Brasilicardin&#8197;A (1) consists of an unusual anti/syn/anti&#8208;perhydrophenanthrene skeleton with a carbohydrate side chain and an amino acid moiety. It exhibits potent immunosuppressive activity, yet its mode of action differs from standard drugs that are currently in use. Further pre&#8208;clinical evaluation of this promising, biologically active natural product is hampered by restricted access to the ready material, as its synthesis requires both a low&#8208;yielding fermentation process using a pathogenic organism and an elaborate, multi&#8208;step total synthesis. Our semi&#8208;synthetic approach included a) the heterologous expression of the brasilicardin&#8197;A gene cluster in different non&#8208;pathogenic bacterial strains producing brasilicardin&#8197;A aglycone (5) in excellent yield and b) the chemical transformation of the aglycone 5 into the trifluoroacetic acid salt of brasilicardin&#8197;A (1&#8201;a) via a short and straightforward five&#8208;steps synthetic route. Additionally, we report the first preclinical data for brasilicardin&#8197;A.

         <title>Scalable fabrication of crystalline COF membrane from amorphous polymeric membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic framework (COF) membranes hold tremendous potential for widespread applicability, but their scalable fabrication remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate the disorder&#8208;to&#8208;order transformation from amorphous polymeric membrane to crystalline COF membrane  via  monomer exchange. Solution&#8208;processing method is used to prepare amorphous membranes and the replacing monomer is selected based on the chemical and thermodynamical stability of the final framework. Afterwards, the reversible imine bonds allow the extraneous monomers to replace the pristine monomers within amorphous membrane, driving the transformation from disordered network to ordered framework. The incorporation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds enables the crystalline COF to imprint the morphology of amorphous membrane. The COF membranes harvest proton conductivity up to 0.53 S cm  &#8722;1  at 80 &#176;C. Our strategy builds a bridge between amorphous polymeric and crystalline COF membranes, not only paving the way to large&#8208;scale fabrication of COF membranes, but also affording some guidance on materials processing via disorder&#8208;to&#8208;order transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Mode Reconfigurable DNA&#8208;Based Chemical Reaction Circuits for Soft Matter Computing and Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we developed pH&#8208;responsive DNA switching circuits for directing mechanical deformation of microgel swelling system through multiple chemical pathways of soft matter computing with chemical reaction networks.







Abstract
Developing smart material systems for performing different tasks in diverse environments remains challenging. Here, we show that by integrating stimuli&#8208;responsive soft materials with multi&#8208;mode reconfigurable DNA&#8208;based chemical reaction circuits (D&#8208;CRCs), it can control size change of microgels with multiple reaction pathways and adapt expansion behaviors to meet diverse environments. We first use pH&#8208;responsive intramolecular conformational switches for regulating DNA strand displacement reactions (SDRs). The ability to regulate SDRs with tunable pH&#8208;dependence allows to build dynamic chemical reaction networks with diverse reaction pathways. We confirm that the designed DNA switching circuits are reconfigurable at different pH and perform different logic operations, and the swelling of DNA switching circuit&#8208;integrated microgel systems can be programmably directed by D&#8208;CRCs. Our approach provides insight into building smart responsive materials and fabricating autonomous soft robots.

         <title>Synthesis and Multiple Subsequent Reactivity of Anionic cyclo&#8208;E3 Ligand Complexes (E=P, As)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transfer of an intact cyclo&#8208;E3 ligand (E=P, As) from the nickel complex [Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Ni(&#951;3&#8208;E3)] to the anionic cobalt complex [Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co(&#951;3&#8208;E3)]&#8722; was achieved, which was afterwards quenched with main group electrophiles such as chlorophosphanes (R2PCl). That way, the E3 cycle can be expanded to a substituted four&#8208;membered ring, which undergoes further rearrangement processes by ring contractions to a cyclo&#8208;E3 ligand with an exocyclic {PR2} unit.







Abstract
A synthetic pathway for the synthesis of novel anionic sandwich complexes with a cyclo&#8208;E3 (E=P, As) ligand as an end deck was developed giving [Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co(&#951;3&#8208;E3)]&#8722; (Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;=1,2,4&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcyclopentadienyl, E=P ([5]), As ([6])) in good yields suitable for further reactivity studies. In the reaction with the chlorophosphanes R2PCl (R=Ph, Cy, tBu), neutral complexes with a disubstituted cyclo&#8208;E3P (E=P, As) ligand in [Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co(&#951;3&#8208;E3PR2)] (E=P (7&#8201;a&#8211;c), As (9&#8201;a&#8211;c)) were obtained. These compounds can be partially or completely converted into complexes with a cyclo&#8208;E3 (E=P, As) ligand with an exocyclic {PR2} unit in [Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co(&#951;2:&#951;1&#8208;E3PR2)] (E=P (8&#8201;a&#8211;c), As (10&#8201;a&#8211;c)). Additionally, the insertion of the chlorosilylene [LSiCl] (L=(tBuN)2CPh) into the cyclo&#8208;E3 ligand of [5] and [6] was achieved and the novel heteroatomic complexes [Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co(&#951;3&#8208;E3SiL)] (E=P (11), As (12)) could be isolated. The reaction pathway was elucidated by DFT calculations.

         <title>Changing the Reactivity of Zero&#8208; and Mono&#8208;Valent Germanium with a Redox Non&#8208;Innocent Bis(silylenyl)carborane Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bis(silylenyl) ortho&#8208;dicarborane&#8208;supported zero&#8208;valent Ge complex (germylone) 1 undergoes facile dimerization with Ge&#8722;Ge bond formation upon one&#8208;electron oxidation and reduction to furnish the bis(silylene)&#8208;supported dicationic and dianionic [GeI&#8211;GeI] complexes 2 and 3, respectively. A neutral complex 4 bearing a Ge22+ dumbbell embedded in a shell of two radical&#8208;anionic di&#8208; (silylenyl)dicarborane ligands could be synthesized.







Abstract
Using the chelating C,C&#8242;&#8208;bis(silylenyl)&#8208;ortho&#8208;dicarborane ligand, 1,2&#8208;(RSi)2&#8208;1,2&#8208;C2B10H10 [R=PhC(NtBu)2], leads to the monoatomic zero&#8208;valent Ge complex (&#8220;germylone&#8221;) 3. The redox non&#8208;innocent character of the carborane scaffold has a drastic influence on the reactivity of 3 towards reductants and oxidants. Reduction of 3 with one molar equivalent of potassium naphthalenide (KC10H8) causes facile oxidation of Ge0 to GeI along with a two&#8208;electron reduction of the C2B10 cluster core and subsequent GeI&#8208;GeI coupling to form the dianionic bis(silylene)&#8208;supported Ge2 complex 4. In contrast, oxidation of 3 with one molar equivalent of [Cp2Fe][B{C6H3(CF3)2}4] as a one&#8208;electron oxidant furnishes the dicationic bis(silylene)&#8208;supported Ge2 complex 5. The Ge0 atom in 3 acts as donor towards GeCl2 to form the trinuclear mixed&#8208;valent Ge0&#8594;GeII&#8592;Ge0 complex 6, from which dechlorination with KC10H8 affords the neutral Ge2 complex 7 as a diradical species.

         <title>Noncanonical Heme Ligands Steer Carbene Transfer Reactivity in an Artificial Metalloenzyme**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metalloprotein properties can be tuned by changing the primary metal coordination sphere. Here amber stop codon suppression with engineered pyrrolysyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases was used to replace the proximal histidine in myoglobin with a range of new amino acids. In addition to tuning the heme redox potential over a &gt;200 mV range, these noncanonical ligands modulate the protein's carbene transfer activity with ethyl diazoacetate.







Abstract
Changing the primary metal coordination sphere is a powerful strategy for tuning metalloprotein properties. Here we used amber stop codon suppression with engineered pyrrolysyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases, including two newly evolved enzymes, to replace the proximal histidine in myoglobin with N&#948;&#8208;methylhistidine, 5&#8208;thiazoylalanine, 4&#8208;thiazoylalanine and 3&#8208;(3&#8208;thienyl)alanine. In addition to tuning the heme redox potential over a &gt;200&#8197;mV range, these noncanonical ligands modulate the protein's carbene transfer activity with ethyl diazoacetate. Variants with increased reduction potential proved superior for cyclopropanation and N&#8211;H insertion, whereas variants with reduced Eo values gave higher S&#8211;H insertion activity. Given the functional importance of histidine in many enzymes, these genetically encoded analogues could be valuable tools for probing mechanism and enabling new chemistries.

&lt;p&gt;Metalloprotein properties can be tuned by changing the primary metal coordination sphere. Here amber stop codon suppression with engineered pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetases was used to replace the proximal histidine in myoglobin with a range of new amino acids. In addition to tuning the heme redox potential over a &amp;gt;200 mV range, these noncanonical ligands modulate the protein's carbene transfer activity with ethyl diazoacetate.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing the primary metal coordination sphere is a powerful strategy for tuning metalloprotein properties. Here we used amber stop codon suppression with engineered pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetases, including two newly evolved enzymes, to replace the proximal histidine in myoglobin with N&lt;sub&gt;&#948;&lt;/sub&gt;-methylhistidine, 5-thiazoylalanine, 4-thiazoylalanine and 3-(3-thienyl)alanine. In addition to tuning the heme redox potential over a &amp;gt;200&#8197;mV range, these noncanonical ligands modulate the protein's carbene transfer activity with ethyl diazoacetate. Variants with increased reduction potential proved superior for cyclopropanation and N&#8211;H insertion, whereas variants with reduced &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; values gave higher S&#8211;H insertion activity. Given the functional importance of histidine in many enzymes, these genetically encoded analogues could be valuable tools for probing mechanism and enabling new chemistries.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Chemo&#8208; and Enantioselective Hydrogenation of Conjugated Enynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric hydrogenation is one of the most powerful methods for the preparation of single enantiomer compounds. However, the chemo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrogenation of the relatively inert unsaturated group in substrates possessing multiple unsaturated bonds remains a challenge. We herein report a protocol for the highly chemo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrogenation of conjugated enynes while keeping the alkynyl bond intact. Mechanism studies indicate that the accompanying Zn  2+  generated from zinc reduction of the Co  II  complex plays a critical role to initiate a plausible Co  I  /Co  III  catalytic cycle. This approach allows for the highly efficient generation of chiral propargylamines (up to 99.9% ee and 2000 S/C) and further useful chemical transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Post&#8208;synthetic modification unlocks a 2D&#8208;to&#8208;3D switch in MOF breathing response: a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;diffraction mapping study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:    Post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) of the interpenetrated diamondoid metal&#8208;organic framework (Me  2  NH  2  )[In(BDC&#8208;NH  2  )  2  ] (BDC&#8208;NH  2  = aminobenzenedicarboxylate)  SHF&#8208;61  proceeds quantitatively in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal manner to yield the acetamide derivative (Me  2  NH  2  )[In(BDC&#8208;NHC(O)Me)  2  ]  SHF&#8208;62  .  Continuous breathing behaviour during activation/desolvation is retained upon PSM, but pore closing now leads to ring&#8208;flipping to avert steric clash of amide methyl groups of the modified ligands. This triggers a reduction in the amplitude of the breathing deformation in the two dimensions associated with pore diameter, but a large increase in the third dimension associated with pore length. The MOF is thereby converted from predominantly 2D breathing (in  SHF&#8208;61  ) to a distinctly 3D breathing motion (in  SHF&#8208;62  ) indicating a decoupling of the pore&#8208;width and pore&#8208;length breathing motions. These breathing motions have been mapped by a series of single&#8208;crystal diffraction studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Automated Crystal Structure Determination has its Pitfalls: Correction to the Crystal Structures of Iodine Azide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Previously published crystal structure determinations of two modifications of iodine azide (IN  3  ) are corrected. In the original determinations, the very weak X&#8208;ray reflections with odd  k  Miller indices had been discarded, resulting in too small unit cells and models with misordered, partly occupied atomic positions. Using the original diffraction data, refinements with the correct unit cells yield structures of polymeric (&#8210;I&#8210;N  3  &#8210;)  n  chains, that are interlocked to layers. A skilled look at the primary X&#8208;ray data is always recommended to overcome the lack of crystallographic expertise of computers at automated structure determinations.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesizing Photoluminescent Au28(SCH2Ph&#8208;tBu)22 Nanoclusters with Feature Structures by Using A Joint Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal nanoclusters are currently widely researched; however, some fundamental studies, such as studies to improve the understanding of the kernel evolution pattern and structural photoluminescence, are far from complete due to the limitations of the synthesis method. Herein, we introduced a novel strategy&#8722;the joint of the current synthesis methods for atomically precise nanocluster synthesis. As an illustration, we introduced the reducing&#8208;ligand induction joint method and synthesized a novel nanocluster, which was determined to be Au  28  (SCH  2  Ph&#8208;  t  Bu)  22  with the same number of gold atoms as existing Au  28  (SR)  20  nanoclusters but different ligands (hetero&#8208;staple&#8208;homo&#8208;size). Compared with the latter, the former has distinct properties and structures. In particular, a novel kernel evolution pattern was first reported, i.e., the quasi&#8208;linear growth of Au  4  &#8208;tetrahedron by sharing one vertex and feature structures, including a tritetrahedron kernel with two bridging thiolates and two Au  6  (SCH  2  Ph&#8208;  t  Bu)  6  hexamer chair&#8208;like rings on the kernel surface were also first reported, which endow Au  28  (SCH  2  Ph&#8208;  t  Bu)  22  with the best photoluminescence quantum yield among hydrophobic thiolated gold nanoclusters so far, probably due to the enhanced charge transfer from the bi&#8208;ring to the kernel via Au&#8208;Au bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling Five Naked Structures of Tartaric Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unbiased, naked structures of tartaric acid, one of the most important organic compounds existing in nature and a candidate to be present in the interstellar medium, has been revealed in this work for the first time. Solid samples of its naturally occurring (R,R) enantiomer have been vaporized by laser ablation, expanded in a supersonic jet, and characterized by Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy. In the isolation conditions of the jet, we have discovered up to five different structures stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond networks dominated by O&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O=C and O&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O motifs extended along the entire molecule. These five forms, two with an extended (  trans  ) disposition of the carbon chain and three with a bent (  gauche  ) disposition, can serve as a basis to represent the shape of tartaric acid. This work also reports the first set of spectroscopy data that can be used to detect tartaric acid in the interstellar medium.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploration of the reactivity of multivalent electrophiles for affinity labeling: sulfonyl fluoride as a highly efficient and selective label</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing suitable affinity labels for elucidating small molecule target proteins is an important problem in chemical probe&#8208;based approaches to drug target discovery and functional analyses. Here we explored the reactivity of a set of multivalent electrophiles cofunctionalized with a carbohydrate ligand on gold&#8208;nanoparticles to achieve efficient affinity labeling for target protein analysis. Evaluation of the reactivity and selectivity of the electrophiles against three different cognate binding proteins identified arylsulfonyl fluoride as the most efficient protein reactive group in this study. We demonstrated that multivalent arylsulfonyl fluoride probe  4  at 50 nM concentration achieved selective affinity labeling and enrichment of a model protein PNA in cell lysate, which was more effective than photoaffinity probe  1  with arylazide group. Labeling site analysis by LC&#8208;MS/MS revealed that the nanoparticle&#8208;immobilized arylsulfonyl fluoride group can target multiple amino acid residues around the ligand binding site of the target proteins. Our study highlighted the utility of arylsulfonyl fluoride as a highly effective multivalent affinity label suitable for covalently capturing unknown target proteins.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Designing suitable affinity labels for elucidating small molecule target proteins is an important problem in chemical probe-based approaches to drug target discovery and functional analyses. Here we explored the reactivity of a set of multivalent electrophiles cofunctionalized with a carbohydrate ligand on gold-nanoparticles to achieve efficient affinity labeling for target protein analysis. Evaluation of the reactivity and selectivity of the electrophiles against three different cognate binding proteins identified arylsulfonyl fluoride as the most efficient protein reactive group in this study. We demonstrated that multivalent arylsulfonyl fluoride probe  4  at 50 nM concentration achieved selective affinity labeling and enrichment of a model protein PNA in cell lysate, which was more effective than photoaffinity probe  1  with arylazide group. Labeling site analysis by LC-MS/MS revealed that the nanoparticle-immobilized arylsulfonyl fluoride group can target multiple amino acid residues around the ligand binding site of the target proteins. Our study highlighted the utility of arylsulfonyl fluoride as a highly effective multivalent affinity label suitable for covalently capturing unknown target proteins.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Methane Oxidation Greatly Promoted by Chlorine Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The renewable energy&#8208;powered methane (CH4) conversion at ambient conditions is an attractive but highly challenging field. Due to the highly inert feature of CH4, the selective cleavage of its first C&#8210;H bond without over&#8208;oxidation is essential for upgrading CH4  toward value&#8208;added products. In this work, we developed an efficient and selective CH4  conversion approach at room temperatures by intermediate chlorine species (*Cl), which were electrochemically generated and stabilized on cobalt&#8208;nickel mixed spinels with different Co/Ni ratios. The lower overpotentials for *Cl formation enabled effective activation and conversion of CH4  to CH3Cl without over&#8208;oxidation to CO2  , and Ni3+  at the octahedral sites in cobalt&#8208;nickel mixed spinels allowed to stabilize surface&#8208;bound *Cl species. The CoNi2Ox  electrocatalyst exhibited an outstanding yield of CH3Cl (364 mmol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1  ) and a high CH3Cl&#8208;versus&#8208;CO2  selectivity of over 400 at room temperatures, with demonstrated capability of direct CH4  conversion under seawater working conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Four&#8208;step domino reaction enables fully controlled non&#8208;statistical synthesis of hexaarylbenzene with six different aryl groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hexaarylbenzene (HAB) derivatives are versatile aromatic systems playing a significant role as chromophores, liquid crystalline materials, molecular receptors, molecular&#8208;scale devices, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes and candidates for organic electronics. Statistical synthesis of simple symmetrical HABs is known via low&#8208;yielding cyclotrimerization or Diels&#8208;Alder reactions. By contrast, the synthesis of more complex, asymmetrical systems, and without involvement of statistical steps, remains an unsolved problem. Here we present a generally applicable synthetic strategy to access asymmetrical HAB via an atom&#8208;economical and high&#8208;yielding metal&#8208;free four&#8208;step domino reaction using nitrostyrenes and &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dicyanoolefins as easily available starting materials. Resulting domino product &#8211; functionalized triarylbenzene (TAB) &#8208; can be used as a key starting compound to furnish asymmetrically substituted hexaarylbenzenes in high overall yield and without involvement of statistical steps. This straightforward domino process represents a distinct approach to creating diverse and still unexplored HAB scaffolds, containing six different aromatic rings around central benzene core.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolation and Reactivity of Uranyl Superoxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel uranyl superoxide compound reacts with carbon dioxide resulting in uranyl carbonate phases within six days of air exposure, directly linking uranyl superoxide to the carbonate corrosion products observed on the surface of spent nuclear fuel.







Abstract
The high radiation field associated with spent nuclear fuel (UIVO2) pellets produces an array of reactive radical species that impact the corrosion and formation of secondary alteration phases. Dioxygen radicals are important as radiolysis products, but the interaction between these reactive oxygen species and UVIO22+ and its effects on the resultant alteration phases is unclear. We report the first example of a UVI superoxide compound and explore its reactivity in the environments relevant to the storage of spent nuclear fuel. We utilized X&#8208;ray diffraction and Raman scattering techniques to demonstrate that the uranyl superoxide reacts with CO2 in air to afford a mixed uranyl peroxide/carbonate within 3&#8197;days, both in solution and under atmospheric conditions. An additional transformation occurs over the course of 3&#8197;months to form a potassium UVI carbonate (grimselite), which also occurs as an alteration product on Chernobyl corium. Our results demonstrate the presence and significance of the superoxide anion in the alteration of spent nuclear fuel and indicate the impact of uranyl superoxide chemistry on high prevalence of carbonate in the secondary phases of spent nuclear fuel.

         <title>Electron Beam Irradiation&#8208;Induced Formation of Defect&#8208;Rich Zeolites under Ambient Condition within Minutes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect&#8208;rich Na&#8208;A zeolites were synthesized by electron beam irradiation under ambient condition within minutes. The as&#8208;synthesized Na&#8208;A shows enhanced adsorption performance for CO2 and heavy ions in comparison with samples synthesized hydrothermally.







Abstract
Zeolites are a well&#8208;known family of microporous aluminosilicate crystals with a wide range of applications. Their industrial synthetic method under hydrothermal condition requires elevated temperature and long crystallization time and is therefore quite energy&#8208;consuming. Herein, we utilize high&#8208;energy electron beam irradiation generated by an industrial accelerator as a distinct type of energy source to activate the formation reaction of Na&#8208;A zeolite. The initial efforts afford an attractive reaction process that can be achieved under ambient conditions and completed within minutes with almost quantitative yield, leading to notable energy saving of one order of magnitude compared to the hydrothermal reaction. More importantly, electron beam irradiation simultaneously exhibits an etching effect during the formation of zeolite generating a series of crystal defects and additional pore windows that can be controlled by irradiation dose. These observations give rise to significantly enhanced surface area and heavy metal removal capabilities in comparison with Na&#8208;A zeolite synthesized hydrothermally. Finally, we show that this method can be applied to many other types of zeolites.

Abstract
A novel PdII&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective oxycarbonylation of alkenes has been established. The ligand with an ethyl group at the C&#8208;6 position of Pyox plays a significant role in the intermolecular oxypalladation process, leading to high reactivity and excellent enantioselective control. Compared to the conventional methods, the reaction itself features alkenes as easily prepared starting materials, mild and operationally simple reaction conditions, and insensitivities to air and water. Moreover, this method allows for broad alkene substrate scope, excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities, scalabilities and a wide array of applications, and provides a useful route for the convenient and straightforward synthesis of chiral &#946;&#8208;hydroxy alkylcarboxylic acids/esters.

&lt;p&gt;A new anthracycline, utorubicin (UTO), with more potent anticancer activity than the clinically used doxorubicin was synthetized and encapsulated in polymeric nanovesicles (polymersomes) by Lorena Sim&#243;n-Gracia, Tambet Teesalu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202016421"&gt;10.1002/anie.202016421&lt;/a&gt;). The polymersomes were functionalized with tumor penetrating peptides (TPP) that specifically target cancer cells. In breast tumor mice, The TTP coating enhanced the tumor homing of the systemically administered UTO polymersomes.

         <title>A Modular In&#8197;Vitro Platform for the Production of Terpenes and Polyketides from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct conversion of the greenhouse gas CO2&#160;into value&#8208;added compounds remains a major challenge. Simultaneous one&#8208;pot coupling of a synthetic CO2&#8208;fixing cycle with a natural glyoxylate assimilation module and different natural product biosynthetic pathways enables the production of valuable terpenes and polyketides directly from CO2. Demonstration of this modular in vitro platform sets the stage for harnessing the greenhouse gas CO2&#160;as source for the sustainable synthesis of multi&#8208;carbon compounds, as reported by Tobias&#8197;J. Erb et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202102333).

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis and Structural Revision of Dysiherbol&#8197;A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a key step of the first enantioselective total synthesis of the anti&#8208;inflammatory marine meroterpene dysiherbol&#8197;A, the tetra&#8208;carbocyclic core skeleton is set&#8208;up in a unique gold&#8208;catalyzed double cyclization, and the ether bridge of the pentacyclic target structure is spontaneously formed under cyclopropane opening upon deprotection of a late intermediate.







Abstract
A 12&#8208;step total synthesis of the natural product dysiherbol&#8197;A, a strongly anti&#8208;inflammatory and anti&#8208;tumor avarane meroterpene isolated from the marine sponge Dysidea sp., was elaborated. As key steps, the synthesis features an enantioselective Cu&#8208;catalyzed 1,4&#8208;addition/enolate&#8208;trapping opening move, an Au&#8208;catalyzed double cyclization to build up the tetracyclic core&#8208;carbon skeleton, and a late installation of the C5&#8208;bridgehead methyl group via proton&#8208;induced cyclopropane opening associated with spontaneous cyclic ether formation. The obtained pentacyclic compound (corresponding to an anhydride of the originally suggested structure for dysiherbol&#8197;A) showed identical spectroscopic data as the natural product, but an opposite molecular rotation. CD&#8208;spectroscopic measurements finally confirmed that both the constitution and the absolute configuration of the originally proposed structure of (+)&#8208;dysiherbol&#8197;A need to be revised.

         <title>Materials engineering of violin soundboards by Stradivari and Guarneri</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Leading violinists today still prefer violins made three centuries ago by Stradivari and Guarneri in Cremona, Italy. Their unique qualities remain an unsolved puzzle, including the long&#8208;term durability of soundboards at reduced thickness. Here, we investigated the material properties of Cremonese soundboards using a wide range of spectroscopic, microscopic, and chemical techniques. We found similar types of spruce in Cremonese soundboards as in modern instruments, but Cremonese spruces exhibit unnatural elemental compositions and oxidation patterns that suggest artificial manipulation. Combining analytical data and historical information, we may deduce the minerals being added and their potential functions&#8212;borax and metal sulfates for fungal suppression, table salt for moisture control, alum for molecular crosslinking, and potash or quicklime for alkaline treatment. The overall purpose may have been wood preservation or acoustic tuning. Hemicellulose fragmentation and altered cellulose nanostructures are observed in heavily&#8208;treated Stradivari specimens, which show diminished second&#8208;harmonic generation signals. Guarneri&#8217;s practice of crosslinking wood fibers via aluminum coordination may also affect mechanical and acoustic properties. Our data suggest that old masters undertook materials engineering experiments to produce soundboards with unique properties.</dc:description>

         <title>RuV&#8208;Acylimido Intermediate in [RuIV(Por)Cl2]&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8211;N Bond Formation: Spectroscopic Characterization, Reactivity, and Catalytic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental studies including ESI&#8208;MS, EPR spectroscopy and KIE, and also DFT calculations point to the intermediacy of a porphyrin&#8208;supported RuV(NCOR) species in [RuIV(Por)Cl2]&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N bond formation reactions with acyl azides N3COR (up to 99&#8201;% yield). The [RuIV(Por)Cl2]/N3COR catalytic method is applicable to various substrates, including alkenes, indoles, silyl enol ethers, and C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N bond formation reactions via acylnitrene transfer have recently attracted much attention, but direct detection of the proposed acylnitrenoid/acylimido M(NCOR) (R=aryl or alkyl) species in these reactions poses a formidable challenge. Herein, we report on Ru(NCOR) intermediates in C&#8722;N bond formation catalyzed by [RuIV(Por)Cl2]/N3COR, a catalytic method applicable to aziridine/oxazoline formation from alkenes, amination of substituted indoles, &#945;&#8208;amino ketone formation from silyl enol ethers, amination of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, and functionalization of natural products and carbohydrate derivatives (up to 99&#8201;% yield). Experimental studies, including HR&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS and EPR measurements, coupled with DFT calculations, lend evidence for the formulation of the Ru(NCOR) acylnitrenoids as a RuV&#8208;imido species.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining junction enhanced Raman and conductance spectroscopies provides a novel approach for studying chemical systems at the single molecule level. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202100886), Joshua Hihath&#160;et&#8197;al.&#160;show that by simultaneously measuring the transport properties and the Raman response of a single molecule it is possible to extract multidimensional information about the junction's mechanical, electrical, and optical properties to understand the role of structural dynamics on molecular charge transport.

         <title>Cancer&#8208;Cell&#8208;Activated in situ Synthesis of Mitochondria&#8208;Targeting AIE Photosensitizer for Precise Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mitochondria&#8208;targeting AIE photosensitizer is specifically synthesized inside cancer cells, realizing precise photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
Maximization of phototoxic damage on tumor with minimized side effect on normal tissue is essential for effective anticancer photodynamic therapy (PDT). This requires highly cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;specific or even cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;organelle&#8208;specific synthesis or delivery of efficient photosensitizers (PSs) in vitro and in vivo, which is difficult to achieve. Herein, we report a strategy of cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;activated PS synthesis, by which an efficient mitochondria&#8208;targeting photosensitizer with aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission (AIE) feature can be selectively synthesized as an efficient image&#8208;guided PDT agent inside cancer cells. MOF&#8208;199, a CuII&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework, was selected as an inert carrier to load the PS precursors for efficient delivery and served as a CuI catalyst source for in situ click reaction to form PSs exclusively in cancer cells. The in situ synthesized PS showed mitochondria&#8208;targeting capability, allowing potent cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;specific ablation under light irradiation. The high specificity of PSs produced in cancer cells also makes it safer post&#8208;treatment.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Mediated Construction of an Ultrathin Free&#8208;Standing Covalent Organic Framework Membrane for Efficient Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A free&#8208;standing covalent organic framework (COF) membrane with controlled thickness was obtained by using a surface&#8208;initiated polymerization strategy (see picture). The rigid organic skeleton and defined pore structure of the COF membrane as well as the abundance of sulfonic acid groups throughout the layer led to superior proton conductivity of 0.54&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C in pure water.







Abstract
As a new class of crystalline porous organic materials, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have attracted considerable attention for proton conduction owing to their regular channels and tailored functionality. However, most COFs are insoluble and unprocessable, which makes membrane preparation for practical use a challenge. In this study, we used surface&#8208;initiated condensation polymerization of a trialdehyde and a phenylenediamine for the synthesis of sulfonic COF (SCOF) coatings. The COF layer thickness could be finely tuned from 10 to 100&#8197;nm by controlling the polymerization time. Moreover, free&#8208;standing COF membranes were obtained by sacrificing the bridging layer without any decomposition of the COF structure. Benefiting from the abundant sulfonic acid groups in the COF channels, the proton conductivity of the SCOF membrane reached 0.54&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C in pure water. To our knowledge, this is one of the highest values for a pristine COF membrane in the absence of additional additives.

         <title>Chirality Transfer from an Innately Chiral Nanocrystal Core to a Nematic Liquid Crystal: Surface&#8208;Modified Cellulose Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The helical twisting power of neat as well as several surface&#8208;functionalized cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs*), exhibiting innate molecular and structural chirality, was evaluated in a nematic liquid crystal as a reporter medium. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202105357), Diana P.&#8197;N. Gon&#231;alves and Torsten Hegmann report that all CNC* species were able to induce and amplify chirality at the nanoscale level, especially those functionalized with mesogenic molecules that better resembled the N&#8208;LC host molecules. Interestingly, surface functionalization with chiral molecules did not appear to enhance the helical twisting power of the CNCs thereby supporting the role of innate nanocrystal core chirality.

         <dc:description>An efficient synthesis of acid&#8208;free neutral oxoborane of the type carboranyl&#8208;B(carbene)=O has been developed via a serendipitous discovery, from the reaction of 1,2&#8208;[BBr(carbene)]&#8208;o&#8208;carborane with AgOTf. This represents a new type of oxoboranes. The stabilization of such oxoborane may be attributed to (1) kinetic stabilization provided by a bulky 3D carboranyl ligand, and (2) thermodynamic stabilization offered by a carbene ligand. Crystallographic analyses support the presence of the shortest terminal B=O double bond ever reported thus far. Its reactivity has also been examined.</dc:description>

         <title>TADF&#8208;Type Organic Afterglow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a highly efficient dopant&#8208;matrix afterglow system enabled by TADF mechanism to realize afterglow quantum yields of 60&#8208;70%, which features a moderate rate constant for reverse intersystem crossing (  k  RISC  ) to simultaneously improve afterglow quantum yields and maintain afterglow emission lifetime. Difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;diketonate (BF  2  bdk) compounds are designed with multiple electron&#8208;donating groups to possess moderate  k  RISC  values and are selected as luminescent dopants. The matrices with carbonyl functional groups such as phenyl benzoate (PhB) have been found to interact with and perturb BF  2  bdk excited states by dipole&#8208;dipole interactions and thus enhance the intersystem crossing of BF  2  bdk excited states. Through dopant&#8208;matrix collaboration, the efficient TADF&#8208;type afterglow materials have been achieved to exhibit excellent processability into desired shapes and large&#8208;area films by melt casting, as well as aqueous afterglow dispersions for potential bioimaging applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Abstract:  An organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid polyiodate, namely, [  o  &#8208;C  5  H  4  NHOH]  2  [I  7  O  18  (OH)]&#183;3H  2  O (  I  )&#65292; featuring a novel branched polyiodate chain has been obtained by evaporation method. [  o  &#8208;C  5  H  4  NHOH]  2  [I  7  O  18  (OH)]&#183;3H  2  O (  I  ) crystalizes in the polar space group  Ia  and features an [I  7  O  18  (OH)]  2&#8208;  &#8734;  branched polyiodate chain in which [I  3  O  9  ]  3&#8208;  trimers are grafted on the same side of the one&#8208;dimensional (1D) chain based on [I  4  O  11  (OH)]  3&#8208;  tetramers.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of new&#8208;type memristors with special performance is of great interest. Here, an inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid crystalline polyoxometalate (POM) with usual dynamic structures is reported and used as active material for fabricating memristor with unique temperature&#8208;regulated resistive switching behaviors. The hybrid POM not only exhibits tunable thermochromic properties, but also thermal&#8208;induced reversible aggregation and disaggregation reactions, leading to reversible structural transformations in SCSC fashion. Further, the memory device using the hybrid POM as active layer exhibits uncommon performance, which can keep resistive switching silent in the low temperature range of 30&#8208;150&#176;C, but show nonvolatile memory behavior in the high temperature range of 150&#8208;270&#176;C. Particularly, the silent and working states at three special temperatures (30, 150 and 270&#176;C) can be monitored by chromism. The correlation between structure and resistive switching property of the material has been discussed. The work demonstrates that crystalline inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid POMs are promising materials for making memristors with superior performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Side&#8208;Chain Engineering for Enhancing the Molecular Rigidity and Photovoltaic Performance of Noncovalently Fused&#8208;Ring Electron Acceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Side&#8208;chain engineering has been proven to be an effective strategy to regulate the solubility and packing behavior of organic materials. Recently, a unique strategy, so&#8208;called terminal side&#8208;chain (T&#8208;SC) engineering, has attracted much attention in the field of organic solar cells (OSCs), whereas it still lacks deep understanding of the mechanism. Herein, a new noncovalently fused&#8208;ring electron acceptor (NFREA) containing two T&#8208;SCs (  NoCA&#8208;5  ) was designed and synthesized. It is found that the introduction of T&#8208;SCs can enhance molecular rigidity and intermolecular  &#960;  &#8208;  &#960;  stacking, which is confirmed by the smaller Stokes shift value, lower reorganization free energy, and shorter  &#960;  &#8208;  &#960;  stacking distance, in comparison to  NoCA&#8208;1  . Hence, the  NoCA&#8208;5  &#8208;based device exhibits a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.82% in labs and a certified PCE of 14.5%, resulting from a high electron mobility, a short charge&#8208;extraction time, a small Urbach energy (  E  u  ), and a favorable phase separation. This work provided new ideas for designing high&#8208;performance NFREAs.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thiocarbonylation of alkynes offers an ideal procedure for the synthesis of unsaturated thioesters. In this report, a robust ligand&#8208;controlled regioselective thiocarbonylation of alkynes is developed. Utilizing boronic acid and 5&#8208;chlorosalicylic acid as the acid additive to  in  &#8208;  situ  form 5&#8208;chloroborosalicylic acid (5&#8208;Cl&#8208;BSA), and bis(2&#8208;diphenylphosphinophenyl)ether (DPEphos) as the ligand, linear  &#945;,&#946;  &#8208;unsaturated thioesters were produced in a straightforward manner. Switching the ligand to tri(2&#8208;furyl)phosphine can turn the reaction selectivity to give branched products. Remarkably, this approach also represents the first example on thiocarbonylation of internal alkynes.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Permeable Lithium&#8208;ion Channels on Lithium Metal for Practical Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium metal batteries are considered a promising candidate for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy storage. However, the strong reducibility of lithium and highly reactivity when contacting oxidants, such as lithium polysulfides in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, caused by the serious &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221; and leads to low Coulombic efficiency. Herein we design selectively permeable lithium&#8208;ion channels on lithium metal surface, which allow lithium ions to pass through by electrochemical overpotential, while the polysulfides are effectively blocked due to the much larger steric hindrance than lithium ions. The selective permeation of lithium ion through the channels is further elucidated by the molecular simulation and visualization experiment. Consequently, a prolonged cycle life of 75 cycles and high Coulombic efficiency of 99% are achieved in a practical Li&#8211;S pouch cell with limited amounts of lithium and electrolyte, confirming the unique role the selective ion permeation plays in protecting highly reactive alkali metal anodes in working batteries.</dc:description>

Consequently, a prolonged cycle life of 75 cycles and high Coulombic efficiency of 99% are achieved in a practical Li&#8211;S pouch cell with limited amounts of lithium and electrolyte, confirming the unique role the selective ion permeation plays in protecting highly reactive alkali metal anodes in working batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergistic Polarization Engineering on Bulk and Surface for Boosting CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sluggish charge kinetics and low CO2  affinity seriously inhibit CO2  photoreduction. Herein, the synchronous promotion of charge separation and CO2  affinity of Bi4Ti3O12  is realized by coupling corona poling and surface I&#8208;grafting. Corona poling enhances ferroelectric polarization of Bi4Ti3O12  by aligning the domains direction, which profoundly promotes charge transfer along opposite directions across bulk. Surface I&#8208;grafting forms a surface local electric field for further separating charge carriers, and provides abundant active sites to enhance CO2 adsorption. Notably, the two modifications cooperatively further increase the ferroelectric polarization of Bi4Ti3O12  , which maximize the separation efficiency of photogenerated charges, resulting in a highly&#8208;enhanced CO production rate of 15.1 &#181;mol&#183;g  &#8208;1&#183;h  &#8208;1  (nearly 9 times) with no sacrificial agents or cocatalysts. This work discloses that ferroelectric polarization and surface ion grafting can promote CO2  photoreduction in a synergistic way.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new method for the synthesis of chiral diene rhodium catalysts is introduced. The readily available racemic tetrafluoro&#8208;benzobarrelene complexes [(R  2  &#8208;TFB)RhCl]  2  &#160;were separated into two enantiomers via selective coordination of one of them with the auxiliary&#160;  S  &#8208;salicyl&#8208;oxazoline ligand. One of the resulting chiral complexes with an exceptionally bulky diene ligand [(  R,R  &#8208;iPr  2  &#8208;TFB)RhCl]  2  &#160;proved to be an efficient catalyst for the asymmetric insertion of diazoesters into B&#8208;H and Si&#8208;H bonds giving the functionalized organoboranes and silanes with high yields (79&#8208;97%) and enantiomeric purity (87&#8208;98% ee).

         <title>Decatungstate&#8208;mediated C(sp3)&#8210;H Heteroarylation via Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover in Batch and Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic hydrogen atom transfer is a very powerful strategy for the regioselective C(sp  3  )&#8210;H functionalization of organic molecules. Herein, we report on the unprecedented combination of decatungstate hydrogen atom transfer photocatalysis with the oxidative Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover concept to access the direct net&#8208;oxidative C(sp  3  )&#8210;H heteroarylation. The present methodology demonstrates a high functional group tolerance (40 examples) and is scalable when using continuous&#8208;flow reactor technology. The developed protocol is also amenable to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of biologically relevant molecules such as stanozolol, (&#8210;)&#8208;ambroxide, podophyllotoxin and dideoxyribose.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiols act as methyl traps in the biocatalytic demethylation of guaiacol derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Demethylating methyl phenyl ethers is challenging, especially when the products are catechol derivatives prone to follow&#8208;up reactions. For biocatalytic demethylation, monooxygenases have previously been described requiring molecular oxygen which may cause oxidative side reactions. Here we show that such compounds can be demethylated anaerobically by using cobalamin&#8208;dependent methyltransferases exploiting thiols like ethyl 3&#8208;mercaptopropionate as a methyl trap. Using just two equivalents of this reagent, a broad spectrum of substituted guaiacol derivatives were demethylated, with conversions mostly above 90%. This strategy was used to prepare the highly valuable antioxidant hydroxytyrosol on a one&#8208;gram scale in 97% isolated yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Zeolitic Octahedral Metal Oxides with Ultra&#8208;Small Micropores for C2 Hydrocarbon Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Separation of C  2  hydrocarbons, C  2  H  6  , C  2  H  4  , and C  2  H  2  , remains significant challenges in chemical industry. However, there are only few adsorbents that can effectively isolate C  2  hydrocarbons from their mixtures particularly at a high temperature. Herein, we design a zeolitic octahedral metal oxide based on  &#949;  &#8208;Keggin polyoxometalates with metal ion linkers. Single gas adsorption of the material shows the different adsorption performances for the C  2  hydrocarbons and the strong interaction of the material with the C  2  hydrocarbons. Dynamic competitive adsorption experiments show that the material efficiently separates each of the binary C  2  hydrocarbon mixtures and even the ternary C  2  hydrocarbon mixtures with high selectivity. The material keeps high separation performance even the temperature was increased to 85  o  C. The material is stable and is able to be reused without loss of the separation performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrasmall nanocapsules obtained by controlling Ostwald ripening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&lt;p class="Abstract"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN&#8208;GB"&gt;We describe here a method to synthesize ultrasmall nanocapsules with a diameter of 6 nm, exhibiting a well&#8208;defined core&#8208;shell morphology. Remarkably, the nanocapules are synthesized in a miniemulsion process without the need of large amounts of surfactant as commonly used in the microemulsion process. Ultrasmall nanocapsules with an oil core and a silica shell are formed by the concurrent processes of a sol&#8208;gel reaction and Ostwald ripening. Using solvents with different water solubilities and alkoxysilanes with different reactivities, we demonstrate that sizes of obtained nanocapsules depend on the ripening rate and alkoxysilane conversion rate. The method can be also used for encapsulating natural oils such as peppermint oil and limonene. This work shows that the Ostwald ripening phenomenon can be employed beneficially for the preparation of very small colloids.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Changes during the Growth of Atomically Precise Metal Oxido Nanoclusters from Combined Pair Distribution Function and Small&#8208;Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of  in situ  Pair Distribution Function (PDF) analysis and Small&#8208;Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering (SAXS) allows to analyze the formation mechanism of metal oxido nanoclusters and cluster&#8208;solvent interactions as they take place. Here, we demonstrate the method for the formation of clusters with a [Bi  38  O  45  ] core. Upon dissolution of crystalline [Bi  6  O  5  (OH)  3  (NO  3  )  5  ]&#183;3H  2  O in DMSO, an intermediate rapidly forms, which slowly grows to stable [Bi  38  O  45  ] clusters. To identify the intermediate, we developed an automated modelling method, where smaller [Bi  x  O  y  ] structures, based on the [Bi  38  O  45  ] framework, are tested against the data. [Bi  22  O  26  ] was identified as the main intermediate species, illustrating how combined PDF and SAXS analysis is a powerful tool to provide insights into nucleation on an atomic scale. In addition, we use PDF to provide information on the interaction between nanoclusters and solvent, which is shown to depend on the nature of the ligands on the cluster surface.</dc:description>

         <title>A Molecular Hybrid of an Atomically Precise Silver Nanocluster and Polyoxometalates for H2 Cleavage into Protons and Electrons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically precise silver (Ag) nanoclusters are promising materials as catalysts, photocatalysts, and sensors because of their unique structures and mixed&#8208;valence states (Ag+/Ag0). However, their low stability hinders the in&#8208;depth study of their intrinsic reactivity and catalytic property accompanying their redox processes. Herein, we demonstrate that a molecular hybrid of an atomically precise {Ag27}17+  nanocluster and polyoxometalates (POMs) can efficiently cleave H2  into protons and electrons. The Ag nanocluster accommodates electrons through the redox reaction from {Ag27}17+  to {Ag27}13+, and the POM ligands play the following important roles: (i) a significant stabilization of the typically unstable Ag nanocluster to preserve its structure during the redox reaction with H2, (ii) formation of a unique interface between the Ag nanocluster and metal oxides for efficient H2  cleavage, and (iii) storage of the generated protons on the negatively charged basic surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction Activity of Metal Coordination Polymer via d&#8208;&#960; Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;noble transition metal complexes have attracted growing interest as efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) while their activities still lack rational and effective regulation. Herein, we propose a d&#8208;&#960; conjugation strategy for rough and fine tuning of ORR activity in TM&#8208;BTA (TM = Mn/Fe/Co/Ni/Cu, BTA = 1,2,4,5&#8208;benzenetetramine) coordination polymers. By first&#8208;principle calculations, we elucidate that the strong d&#8208;&#960; conjugation elevates the  [[EQUATION]] / [[EQUATION]]  orbitals of TM centers to enhance intermediate absorption and strengthens the electronic modulation effect from substitute groups on ligands. Based on this strategy, Co&#8208;TABQ (tetramino benzoquinone) are found to approach the top of ORR activity volcano. The synthesized Co&#8208;TABQ with atomically distributed Co on carbon nanotubes exhibits a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.85 V and a specific current of 130 mA mgmetal&#8208;1 at 0.8 V, outperforming the benchmark Pt/C. The high activity, low peroxide yield, and considerable durability of Co&#8208;BTA and Co&#8208;TABQ promise their application in oxygen electrocatalysis. This study provides mechanistic insight into the rational design of transition metal complexes catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Strategy of Manipulating the Number of Selenophene Units and Asymmetric Central Core of Small Molecular Acceptors Enables Polymer Solar Cells with 17.5% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, despite the great achievement made in non&#8208;fullerene small molecular acceptors (NF&#8208;SMAs)&#8208;based polymer solar cells (PSCs), the favourable trade&#8208;off among device parameters is still quite difficult to obtain for further development. Herein,  a novel synergistic strategy of the asymmetric backbone and selenophene substitution on the central core was applied for the first time  and a new family of  symmetric or asymmetric A&#8208;DA&#8217;D&#8208;A type NF&#8208;SMAs (  S&#8208;YSS&#8208;Cl  ,  A&#8208;WSSe&#8208;Cl  , and  S&#8208;WSeSe&#8208;Cl  ) with different numbers of selenophene  were successfully synthesized.  From  S&#8208;YSS&#8208;Cl  to  A&#8208;WSSe&#8208;Cl  and to  S&#8208;WSeSe&#8208;Cl  , a gradually red&#8208;shifted absorption and a gradually larger electron mobility and crystallinity in neat thin film was observed.  Moreover, single crystals results indicate that  A&#8208;WSSe&#8208;Cl  and  S&#8208;WSeSe&#8208;Cl  exhibit stronger and tighter intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions, extra S&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;N non&#8208;covalent intermolecular interactions from central benzothiadiazole, better ordered 3D interpenetrating charge&#8208;transfer networks in comparison with thiophene&#8208;based  S&#8208;YSS&#8208;Cl  . Furthermore,  PM6  :A&#8208;WSSe&#8208;Cl  blend film exhibits the most favourable morphology with the best face&#8208;on intermolecular packing, and the most efficient charge separation, transport and collection. The asymmetric  A&#8208;  WSSe&#8208;C  l  &#8208;based device presents an impressive PCE of 17.51%, which is obvious higher than that of symmetric  S&#8208;WSeSe&#8208;Cl&#8208;  based (16.01%) and is the highest value for selenophene&#8208;based NF&#8208;SMAs in binary PSCs. These results demonstrate that the combination of the subtle asymmetric core and precise replacement of selenophene on the central core is an effective approach to improve  J  sc  and FF without over sacrificing of  V  oc  for efficient NF&#8208;SMAs.</dc:description>

The catalysts consist of a triazine based prism&#8208;like cage core and pendant chiral base sites and were synthesized straightforwardly. Only 2 mol% of cage catalyst efficiently catalyzed the decarboxylate Mannich reactions of sulfamate&#8208;headed cyclic aldimines and a series of malonic acid half thioesters in nearly quantitative yields and up to 97% ee, enabling an unprecedent organocatalytic approach for the titled reactions. Collective experiment results consistently suggested the essential role of the supramolecular &#960;&#8208;cavity in harnessing cooperative anion&#8208;&#960; interactions for the efficient activation and excellent selectivity control.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1D hollow nanostructures have been considered as promising electrode materials for different electrochemical energy storage applications. This Minireview gives an overview of recent achievements in the rational design and engineering of 1D hollow nanostructures as electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage. This unique class of electrodes offers significant advantages for boosting the electrochemical properties.







Abstract
The unique structural characteristics of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) hollow nanostructures result in intriguing physicochemical properties and wide applications, especially for electrochemical energy storage applications. In this Minireview, we give an overview of recent developments in the rational design and engineering of various kinds of 1D hollow nanostructures with well&#8208;designed architectures, structural/compositional complexity, controllable morphologies, and enhanced electrochemical properties for different kinds of electrochemical energy storage applications (i.e. lithium&#8208;ion batteries, sodium&#8208;ion batteries, lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries, lithium&#8208;selenium sulfur batteries, lithium metal anodes, metal&#8208;air batteries, supercapacitors). We conclude with prospects on some critical challenges and possible future research directions in this field. It is anticipated that further innovative studies on the structural and compositional design of functional 1D nanostructured electrodes for energy storage applications will be stimulated.

         <title>Highly Stable Single Crystals of Three&#8208;Dimensional Porous Oligomer Frameworks Synthesized under Kinetic Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various porous organic single crystals were self&#8208;assembled via intermolecular hydrogen bonding, based on in situ&#8208;formed oligomers linked by imine bonds that appeared via condensation between tetratopic amine and ditopic aldehyde compounds. These structures were noted to remain sufficiently robust even after guest removal, and offered accessible porosity that was comparable, or even superior, to that of other COF materials.







Abstract
Various robust, crystalline, and porous organic frameworks based on in situ&#8208;formed imine&#8208;linked oligomers were investigated. These oligomers self&#8208;assembled through collaborative intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions via liquid&#8211;liquid interfacial reactions. The soluble oligomers were kinetic products with multiple unreacted aldehyde groups that acted as hydrogen bond donors and acceptors and directed the assembly of the resulting oligomers into 3D frameworks. The sequential formation of robust covalent linkages and highly reversible hydrogen bonds enforced long&#8208;range symmetry and facilitated the production of large single crystals, with structures that were unambiguously determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The unique hierarchical arrangements increased the steric hindrance of the imine bond, which prevented attacks from water molecules, greatly improving the stability. The multiple binding sites in the frameworks enabled rapid sequestration of micropollutant in water.

         <title>Origins of Endo Selectivity in Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions of Cyclic Allene Dienophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A study of the factors contributing to endo selectivity in Diels&#8211;Alder reactions with strained cyclic allenes is reported. The contributions of a new type of secondary orbital interaction resulting from the twisted nature of the strained allene, and electrostatic effects, to endo selectivity are established.







Abstract
Strained cyclic allenes, first discovered in 1966 by Wittig and co&#8208;workers, have recently emerged as valuable synthetic building blocks. Previous experimental investigations, and computations reported here, demonstrate that the Diels&#8211;Alder reactions of furans and pyrroles with 1,2&#8208;cyclohexadiene and oxa&#8208; and azaheterocyclic analogs proceed with endo selectivity. This endo selectivity gives the adduct with the allylic saturated carbon of the cyclic allene endo to the diene carbons. The selectivity is very general and useful in synthetic applications. Our computational study establishes the origins of this endo selectivity. We analyze the helical frontier molecular orbitals of strained cyclic allenes and show how secondary orbital and electrostatic effects influence stereoselectivity. The LUMO of carbon&#8208;3 of the allene (C&#8208;3 is not involved in primary orbital interactions) interacts in a stabilizing fashion with the HOMO of the diene in such a way that the carbon of the cyclic allene attached to C&#8208;1 favors the endo position in the transition state. The furan LUMO, allene HOMO interaction reinforces this preference. These mechanistic studies are expected to prompt the further use of long&#8208;avoided strained cyclic allenes in chemical synthesis.
