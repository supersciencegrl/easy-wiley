         <title>Solution&#8208;processed AIEgen NIR OLEDs with EQE Approaching 15%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminogens have attracted intensive attention considering their vast potential applications in areas&#160; like &#160;bioimaging, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) and night&#8208;vision telecommunication. However, organic NIR luminogens with high solid quantum efficiency are scarce, limiting the ir &#160;applications. Here, we&#160; reported &#160;an electron&#8208;deficient acceptor, BSM, based on dithiafulvalene and benzothiadiazole, could work as a strong acceptor to produce highly efficient NIR emitters with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) property. One of the AIEgens, TBSMCN emitted at 820 nm with a solid quantum yield of 10.7%. When applied to solution&#8208;processed OLEDs, an outstanding external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 9.4% was achieved with a peak wavelength at 728 nm. Moreover, its non&#8208;doped device could achieve an extraordinary EQE of 2.2% peaking at 804 nm. In the further optimized configuration, when an extra sensitizer was added to harvest triplet excitons, the EQE unprecedentedly soared up to 14.3% with a peak wavelength of 750 nm.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxygen Vacancy Management for High&#8208;Temperature Mesoporous SnO2 Electron Transport Layers in Printable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The planar SnO  2  electron transport layer (ETL) has contributed to the reported power conversion efficiency (PCE) record of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), while the high&#8208;temperature mesoporous SnO  2  ETL (mp&#8208;SnO  2  ) brings poor device performance. Herein, we report the application of mp&#8208;SnO  2  for efficient printable PSCs via oxygen vacancy (OV) management by introducing magnesium (Mg) into the paste. We find that high&#8208;temperature annealing suppresses self&#8208;doping of SnO  2  by reducing OVs. The introduced Mg occupies both the Sn site and interstitial site of SnO  2  and promotes the formation of OVs. Lattice Mg tends to induce neutral OVs and interstitial Mg could promote the ionization of neutral OVs for self&#8208;doping. The synergy effect on OVs increases the carrier density and upshifts the Fermi level energy of mp&#8208;SnO  2  , ensuring its capability as the well&#8208;performed ETL with trap&#8208;less charge transport and suppressed surface recombination for dramatic improved device PCE from 6.62% to 17.25%.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion&#8208;Directed Regulation of Structures and Luminescence of Heterometallic Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anions have been used to regulate the structures and luminescence of heterometallic clusters. Introducing ClO4&#8208; into orange&#8208;emissive, butterfly&#8208;like [(C)(Au&#8208;PPhpy2)6Ag4](BF4)6 (1, PPhpy2 = bis(2&#8208;pyridyl)phenylphosphine) leads to the formation of red&#8208;emissive [(C)(Au&#8208;PPhpy2)6Ag5(ClO4)3](ClO4)4 (2) with a novel trigonal bipyramidal structure; employing PhCO2&#8208; gives yellow&#8208;emissive, hexagram&#8208;like [(C)(Au&#8208;PPhpy2)6Ag6(PhCO2)3](BF4)5 (3). Notably, 1 exhibits weak luminescence in CH2Cl2/CH3OH = 1:1 (v:v) with a quantum yield (QY) of 0.05, whereas it was dramatically increased to 0.49 and 0.83 for 2 and 3, respectively. Theoretical calculation confirms that the involvement of anions in the electronic structures is responsible for the shifts of emission. The high QYs of 2 and 3 are attributed to the protection provided by ligands and anions. This work demonstrates that anions may serve as an extra designable factor beyond just counterions for functional metal clusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescent Organic&#160;&#960;&#8208;Radicals Stabilized with Boron: Featuring a SOMO&#8211;LUMO Electronic Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>W e report on the fluorescence properties of a new class of emissive and stable&#160; &#960;&#8208;radicals that contain a boron atom at a position distant from the radical center. A fully &#160; planarized derivative exhibited an intense red fluorescence with high fluorescence quantum yields (  &#934;F &gt; 0.67) even in polar solvents. To elucidate the origin of this phenomenon, we synthesized another boron&#8208;stabilized radical that contains a bulky aryl group on the boron atom. A comparison of these derivatives, as well as with conventional donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A)&#8208;type emissive&#160;&#960;&#8208;radicals, unveiled several characteristic&#160; features in their photophysical properties . A theoretical analysis revealed that the SOMO&#8211;LUMO electronic transition generates an emissive D1  &#160;state. Unlike conventional D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A&#8208;type&#160; &#960; &#8208;radicals, this state does not undergo significant structural relaxation. The boron&#8208;stabilized&#160; &#960;&#8208;radicals demonstrated promising potential for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes as an emitting material.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative Palladium/Isothiourea Catalyzed Enantioselective Formal (3+2) Cycloaddition of Vinylcyclopropanes and a,b&#8208;Unsaturated Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A protocol for the enantioselective synthesis of substituted vinylcyclopentanes has been realised using cooperative palladium and isothiourea catalysis. Treatment of vinylcyclopropanes with Pd(PPh  3  )  4  generates a zwitterionic p&#8208;allyl palladium intermediate that intercepts a catalytically generated &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acyl ammonium species prepared from the corresponding &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated  para  &#8208;nitrophenyl ester and the isothiourea (  R  )&#8208;BTM  .  Intermolecular formal (3+2) cycloaddition between these reactive intermediates generates functionalised cyclopentanes in generally good yields and excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantiocontrol (up to &gt;95:5 dr, 97:3 er), with the use of LiCl as an additive proving essential for optimal stereocontrol. To the best of our knowledge a dual transition metal / organocatalytic process involving &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acyl ammonium intermediates has not been demonstrated previously.</dc:description>

         <title>Expeditious Access to Morphinans by Chemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Morphinans are essential medicines derived entirely from poppy supply chains rendered increasingly volatile by climate change. Here, we report a seven&#8208;step, asymmetric chemical synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;codeine from simple materials that requires a total combined reaction time of fewer than 24 hours. The efficiency of our approach arises from a double&#8208;Heck cyclization reaction that generates two rings and two contiguous stereogenic carbon centres in the one pot.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Morphinans are essential medicines derived entirely from poppy supply chains rendered increasingly volatile by climate change. Here, we report a seven-step, asymmetric chemical synthesis of (&#8211;)-codeine from simple materials that requires a total combined reaction time of fewer than 24 hours. The efficiency of our approach arises from a double-Heck cyclization reaction that generates two rings and two contiguous stereogenic carbon centres in the one pot. A subsequent photo-redox hydroamination protocol provides a novel, atom-economical means for assembling the piperidine D-ring of codeine.

         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion provides a promising way to solve problems of greenhouse effect; however, developing low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts to mediate high&#8208;efficiency CO2 reduction remains a grand challenge on account of the limited understanding in the real active sites. Herein, we revealed the operando Zn&#948;+ metalloid sites as the real active sites of stable nonstoichiometric ZnOx structure derived from Zn2P2O7 through operando X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analysis in conjunction with evolutionary&#8208;algorithm&#8208;based global optimization method, which exhibited excellent performance for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO electrocatalysis. Furthermore, theoretical and experimental results demonstrated that Zn&#948;+ metalloid active sites could facilitate the activation of CO2 and the hydrogenation of *CO2, thus accelerating the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. Our work establishes a critical fundamental understanding of the origin of the real active center in the zinc&#8208;based electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting the Productivity of Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Multi&#8208;Carbon Products by Enhancing CO2 Diffusion through a Porous Organic Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous organic cages (POCs) were used as an additive to enhance the CO2 diffusion in flow cell catalyst layers, thus boosting the productivity of the CO2 electroreduction reaction. The Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ products reached 76.1&#8201;% when Cu&#8208;nanorod/CC3 (one of the POCs) was used. The diffusion of CO2 through CC3 to the nanocatalyst surface is easier than in liquid electrolyte, therefore more CO2 molecules make contact with the nanocatalyst.







Abstract
Electroreduction of CO2 into valuable fuels and feedstocks offers a promising way for CO2 utilization. However, the commercialization is limited by the low productivity. Here, we report a strategy to enhance the productivity of CO2 electroreduction by improving diffusion of CO2 to the surface of catalysts using porous organic cages (POCs) as an additive. It was noted that the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ products could reach 76.1&#8201;% with a current density of 1.7&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 when Cu&#8208;nanorod(nr)/CC3 (one of the POCs) was used, which were much higher than that using Cu&#8208;nr. Detailed studies demonstrated that the hydrophobic pores of CC3 can adsorb a large amount of CO2 for the reaction, and the diffusion of CO2 in the CC3 to the nanocatalyst surface is easier than that in the liquid electrolyte. Thus, more CO2 molecules make contact with the nanocatalysts in the presence of CC3, enhancing CO2 reduction and inhibiting generation of H2.

         <title>Tuning an Imine Reductase for the Asymmetric Synthesis of Azacycloalkylamines by Concise Structure&#8208;Guided Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure&#8208;guided engineering of an imine reductase IR&#8208;G36 gave a final variant M5 for reductive amination, enabling the asymmetric synthesis of a series of azacycloalkylamines with up to 47&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 substrate loadings and up to 99&#8201;% conversion and &gt;99&#8201;% ee. Crystal structures of IR&#8208;G36 and computational studies shed light on the structural basis for the performance improvement.







Abstract
Although imine reductases (IREDs) are emerging as attractive reductive aminases (RedAms), their substrate scope is still narrow, and rational engineering is rare. Focusing on hydrogen bond reorganization and cavity expansion, a concise strategy combining rational cavity design, combinatorial active&#8208;site saturation test (CAST), and thermostability engineering was designed, that transformed the weakly active IR&#8208;G36 into a variant M5 with superior performance for the synthesis of (R)&#8208;3&#8208;benzylamino&#8208;1&#8208;Boc&#8208;piperidine, with a 4193&#8208;fold improvement in catalytic efficiency, a 16.2&#8201;&#176;C improvement in Tm, and a significant increase in the e.e. value from 78&#8201;% (R) to &gt;99&#8201;% (R). M5 exhibits broad substrate scope for the synthesis of diverse azacycloalkylamines, and the reaction was demonstrated on a hectogram&#8208;scale under industrially relevant conditions. Our study provides a compelling example of the preparation of versatile and efficient IREDs, with exciting opportunities in medicinal and process chemistry as well as synthetic biology.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A size&#8208;controlled, homogeneous, and ordered biosynthesis of CdS NPs in a bioengineered protein cavity is presented. The formed nano&#8208;bio hybrid facilitates outstanding photocatalytic NADPH regeneration that can be utilized for the photo&#8208;induced activation of redox enzymes. The nano&#8208;bio hybrid presented superior long&#8208;term stereoselective production of a chiral amine that is essential for the pharmaceutical industry.







Abstract
The use of predesigned bioengineered proteins for self&#8208;grown nanomaterials is a promising strategy that opens new scientific directions for biotic&#8208;abiotic nano&#8208;bio hybrid configurations. The unique properties of nanomaterials can alter the original biological paradigm to allow novel metabolic routes or new activation triggers. In this work, we present a synthetic methodology for self&#8208;grown cadmium sulfide quantum dots in a 12&#8208;mer bioengineered stable protein 1 under ambient conditions. The sized controlled crystalline QDs are characterized and utilized for NADPH regeneration that is in turn used for the activation of the imine reductase enzyme. The presented nano&#8208;bio hybrid system enables the production of a single enantiomeric product that is required for the pharmaceutical industry. Our designed system presents superior activity and can continuously operate for at least 22&#8197;hrs with 82&#8201;% conversion efficiency. The obtained results may lay the foundations for future nano&#8208;bio hybrid systems that can operate both in vitro and in vivo.

         <title>Tuning the Elasticity of Nanogels Improves Their Circulation Time by Evading Immune Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small changes in the elasticity of the inherently soft radiolabeled nanogels show major differences in its in vivo circulation half&#8208;life. Longer circulation life renders a higher possibility for nanogels to accumulate in the tumor microenvironment by enhanced permeation and retention effect.







Abstract
Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy is used to treat solid tumors by locally delivering radiation. However, due to nephro&#8208; and hepato&#8208;toxicity, it is limited by its dosage. To amplify radiation damage to tumor cells, radiolabeled nanogels can be used. We show that by tuning the mechanical properties of nanogels significant enhancement in circulation half&#8208;life of the gel could be achieved. We demonstrate why and how small changes in the mechanical properties of the nanogels influence its cellular fate. Nanogels with a storage modulus of 37&#8197;kPa were minimally phagocytosed by monocytes and macrophages compared to nanogels with 93&#8197;kPa modulus. Using PET/CT a significant difference in the blood circulation time of the nanogels was shown. Computer simulations affirmed the results and predicted the mechanism of cellular uptake of the nanogels.

     alt="Tuning the Elasticity of Nanogels Improves Their Circulation Time by Evading Immune Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small changes in the elasticity of the inherently soft radiolabeled nanogels show major differences in its in vivo circulation half-life. Longer circulation life renders a higher possibility for nanogels to accumulate in the tumor microenvironment by enhanced permeation and retention effect.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy is used to treat solid tumors by locally delivering radiation. However, due to nephro- and hepato-toxicity, it is limited by its dosage. To amplify radiation damage to tumor cells, radiolabeled nanogels can be used. We show that by tuning the mechanical properties of nanogels significant enhancement in circulation half-life of the gel could be achieved. We demonstrate why and how small changes in the mechanical properties of the nanogels influence its cellular fate. Nanogels with a storage modulus of 37&#8197;kPa were minimally phagocytosed by monocytes and macrophages compared to nanogels with 93&#8197;kPa modulus. Using PET/CT a significant difference in the blood circulation time of the nanogels was shown. Computer simulations affirmed the results and predicted the mechanism of cellular uptake of the nanogels. Altogether, this work emphasizes the important role of elasticity even for particles that are inherently soft such as nano- or microgels.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8594;Carbon Dative Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ambiphilic system containing a phosphine and a carbenium ion as an L&#8208;type andZ&#8208;type ligand, respectively, readily complexes zero&#8208;valent Group 10 metals to form complexes featuring M&#8594;Ccarbenium dative bonds. The formation of these dative bonds is supported by structural, spectroscopic, and computational studies which show that, out of three metals, palladium is the least metallobasic.







Abstract
As part of our interest in unusual bonding situations, we are now targeting complexes featuring metal&#8594;carbon dative bonds. Here, we report on the formation of such linkages in a series of Group 10 complexes featuring a triarylphosphine ligand functionalized at the &#947; position by a carbenium ion. Through combined synthetic, spectroscopic, and computational studies, we show that the M&#8594;Ccarbenium interaction present in these complexes scales with the basicity of the donor, confirming its dative nature.

The first single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal reversible [2+2] photo&#8208;oligomerization of conjugated dienones under visible light is reported.







Abstract
The synthesis of reversible oligomer/polymers is fascinating both from the perspective of the fundamental understanding as well as their applications, ranging from biomedical to self&#8208;healing smart materials. On the other hand, the reactions that occur in single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) fashion offer great details of the structure, geometry and stereochemistry of the product. However, SCSC [2+2] oligomerization is rather difficult and rare. Further, till date there are no reports for a reversible [2+2] oligomerization in SCSC fashion. In this work, four halogen&#8208;substituted acrylic dienone molecules were deliberately designed and their ability to participate in [2+2] cycloaddition reaction in solid state was studied under visible light. Despite of having the required alignment of double bonds of dienes in all four crystal structures, they were found to exhibit variable reactivities given the differences in their weak intermolecular interactions such as halogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;halogen, halogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions. Notably, one of these materials exhibits reversible oligomerization in a SCSC manner.

         <title>A Bacteria&#8208;Responsive Porphyrin for Adaptable Photodynamic/Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cationic porphyrin that can respond to specific bacteria followed by adaptable photodynamic/photothermal therapy is reported. It can be reduced to phlorin by reductive facultative anaerobes in hypoxic environments, possessing NIR photothermal conversion ability and demonstrating excellent antimicrobial activity by photothermal therapy. With aerobic bacteria, it functions as an efficient antibacterial photosensitizer by photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
We report a cationic porphyrin 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis&#8208;(4&#8208;N&#8208;methylpyridyl)&#8208;porphyrin (TMPyP) that can respond to specific bacteria, followed by adaptable photodynamic/photothermal therapy processes. TMPyP could be reduced to phlorin by facultative anaerobes with a strong reducing ability such as E.&#8197;coli and S.&#8197;typhimurium in hypoxic environments, possessing strong NIR absorption and remarkable photothermal conversion capacity, thus demonstrating excellent antimicrobial activity (&gt;99&#8201;%) by photothermal therapy. While in an aerobic environment with aerobic bacteria, TMPyP functioned as a typical photosensitizer that killed bacteria effectively (&gt;99.9&#8201;%) by photodynamic therapy. By forming a host&#8211;guest complex with cucurbit[7]uril, the biocompatibility of TMPyP significantly improved. This kind of bacteria&#8208;responsive porphyrin shows specificity and adaptivity in antimicrobial treatment and holds potential in non&#8208;invasive treatments of bacterial infections.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Shifting Molecules: Unveiling the Valence Tautomerism Phenomena in Bare Barbaralones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shape&#8208;shifting molecules were probed in the gas phase, conclusively unveiling the valence tautomerism phenomena for an archetypal barbaralone as described by Jos&#233; L. Alonso and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202117045). The two valence tautomers of this bistable molecular system were isolated in a supersonic jet for the first time and characterized by high&#8208;resolution rotational spectroscopy coupled with laser ablation techniques. This observation opens the window toward the characterization of new fluxional systems in isolation conditions.

         <title>Sequencing of Uniform Multifunctional Oligoesters via Random Chain Cleavages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for the determination of the monomer order of sequence&#8208;defined macromolecules by making use of ESI&#8208; or LC&#8211;MS is described. This approach, which relies on the introduction of random chain cleavages within the macromolecular backbone, enabled the rapid chemical sequencing of abiotic macromolecules.







Abstract
Sequence&#8208;defined polymers have been the object of many fascinating studies that focus on their implementation in both material and life science applications. In parallel, iterative synthetic methodologies have become more efficient, whereas the structure elucidation of these molecules is generally dependent on MS/MS analysis. Here, we report an alternative, simple strategy for the determination of the monomer order of uniform oligo(thioether ester)s. This approach, which relies on random cleavages of ester units within the macromolecular backbone via a basic treatment, enables the swift characterization of these macromolecules without the need for MS/MS. Consequently, this method can be used for decoding any information stored within the primary structure of oligoesters by means of ESI&#8208; or LC&#8211;MS. Finally, we speculate that a range of structurally diverse backbones could be susceptible towards this approach, which could promptly expand the library of chemically sequenceable macromolecules.

         <title>Sustainable afterglow room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence emission materials generated using natural phenolics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sustainable afterglow room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from natural phenolics with long lifetime is a particularly attractive phenomenon but remains difficult to achieve. Here, we have prepared sustainable afterglow RTP materials (GA@SA) with a lifetime of up to ~934.7 ms by embedding gallic acid (GA) within a Ca2+&#8208;crosslinked sodium alginate (SA) matrix. The carbonyl moieties of the GA are restricted and H&#8208;type aggregates of GA are formed in the SA matrix, promoting the spin orbit coupling (SOC) of GA and inducing afterglow emission of GA@SA. Moreover, afterglow RTP emission could be produced by embedding different types of natural phenolics such as, tannic acid (TA), caffeic acid (Cafa) and chlorogenic acid (CA) into Ca2+&#8208;crosslinked networks of SA, clearly illustrating the generality of our strategy. As an illustration for potential practical applications, GA@SA was used to prepare afterglow embroidery, which has the potential to be used as anti&#8208;counterfeiting logos for clothing. We anticipate that this research will provide the foundation for a completely new class of sustainable afterglow RTP materials with long lifetime.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Trisubstituted Alkenes by Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Benzylation and Alkene Isomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic strategies that provide stereoselective access to highly substituted alkenes from abundant monosubstituted substrates are exceedingly sought&#8208;after but rare. Here, we show that a&#160;  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;Ni(I) catalytic species mediates efficient union of electronically polarized terminal olefins with benzyl chlorides, in the presence of trimethylsilyl triflate and trimethylamine additives, to generate trisubstituted boron&#8208; and arene&#8208;containing  trans  alkenes in excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities. Control experiments provide evidence for a mechanism involving branched&#8208;selective Heck&#8208;type benzylation that overrides substrate control, followed by  trans  &#8208;selective 1,3&#8208;hydrogen shift. The method&#160;represents a significant addition to the toolbox of reactions for the concise synthesis of unsaturated biologically active compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Intrinsic Nonflammable Ether Electrolytes for Ultrahigh&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries Enabled by Chlorine Functionality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The issues of inherent low anodic stability and high flammability hinder the deployment of the ether&#8208;based electrolytes in practical high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries. Here, we report a rationally designed ether&#8208;based electrolyte with chlorine functionality on ether molecular structure to address these critical challenges. The chloroether&#8208;based electrolyte demonstrates a high Li Coulombic efficiency of 99.2% and a high capacity retention &gt;88% over 200 cycles for Ni&#8208;rich cathodes at an ultrahigh cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6 V (stable even up to 4.7 V). The chloroether&#8208;based electrolyte not only greatly improves electrochemical stabilities of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes under ultrahigh voltages with interphases riched in LiF and LiCl, but possesses the intrinsic nonflammable safety feature owing to the flame&#8208;retarding ability of chlorine functional groups. This study offers a new approach to enable ether&#8208;based electrolytes for high energy density, long&#8208;life and safe Li metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Dehydroxylative Alkylation of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Carboxylic Acids Derivatives via Spin&#8208;center Shift</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A strategically distinct dehydroxylative alkylation reaction of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy carboxylic acid derivatives with alkenes is developed. The reaction starts with the attack of a 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP)&#8208;boryl radical to the carbonyl oxygen atom, followed by a spin&#8208;center shift (SCS) to trigger the C&#8211;O bond scission. The resulting &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radicals couple with a wide range of alkenes to furnish various alkylated products. This strategy allows for the efficient conversion of a wide array of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy amides and esters derived from several biomass molecules and natural products to value&#8208;added compounds. Experimental and computational studies verified the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Surface&#8208;Electron Spins on Fe3O4(111) Through Chemisorption of Carbon Monoxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The adsorption&#8208;induced flip of electron spin at interfaces is an important but poorly understood phenomenon for magnetic devices, sensors, and heterogeneous catalysis, due to the difficulties in determining the surface spins at atomic resolution. We present an evolutionary magnetic order searching method that allows efficient identification of the ground state spin configuration of magnetic bulk and surfaces. Using this approach, we have discovered for the first time a set of adsorption&#8208;induced near&#8208;degenerate surface magnetic states on the Fe3O4(111) surface. Molecular adsorption of CO causes a destabilization of the magnetic states of the clean surface leading to a set of near&#8208;degenerate surface magnetic states at medium coverage, which causes an abrupt increase of the magnetic entropy on the surface. The empty 2&#960;* orbital of CO, which could accommodate the back donation of the spin density in the Fe  d  orbitals, plays a key role for the CO adsorption&#8208;induced spin transition.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ&#160;Hydrolysis of Block Copolymers at the Water&#8208;Oil Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In situ manipulation of the chemical composition of block copolymers at the fluid interfaces affords a route by which the interfacial tension, the packing of the copolymers, and the penetration of the blocks into the two liquids can be manipulated. Here, a series of linear block copolymers of poly(solketal methacrylate&#8208;  b  &#8208;styrene) (PSM&#8208;  b  &#8208;PS) are used, converting hydrophobic PSM block into a hydrophilic glycerol monomethacrylate (GM) block, that results in a marked decrease in the liquid&#8208;liquid interfacial tension. The kinetics of the first&#8208;order hydrolysis reaction was analyzed by monitoring the time&#8208;dependent interfacial tension as a function of pH, polymer concentration, molecular weight, and composition. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) was used to measure the in&#8208;plane dynamics of the copolymers before and after hydrolysis.  Overall, this work provides insight into a quantitative pathway by which in situ interfacial reactions may be performed and monitored in real time, with complete alteration of the interfacial activity of the molecule.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt/Salox&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8211;H Functionalization of Arylphosphinamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Previous methods on Co(III)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8208;H activation rely on the use of tailor&#8208;made cyclopentadienyl&#8208;ligated Co(III) complexes, which require lengthy steps for the preparation. Herein, we report an unprecedented enantioselective C&#8211;H functionalization enabled by a simple Co(II)/salicyloxazoline (Salox) catalysis.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Previous methods on Co(III)-catalyzed asymmetric C-H activation rely on the use of tailor-made cyclopentadienyl-ligated Co(III) complexes, which require lengthy steps for the preparation. Herein, we report an unprecedented enantioselective C&#8211;H functionalization enabled by a simple Co(II)/salicyloxazoline (Salox) catalysis. The chiral Salox ligands can be easily prepared in one step from salicylonitrile and chiral amino alcohols. A broad range of  P  -stereogenic compounds were synthesized in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (45 examples, up to 99% yield and &amp;gt;99% ee). The isolation and characterization of several intermediates provided insights into the generation of active catalytic cobalt species, the action of Salox, and the mode of stereocontrol.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Nanolayer for Copper Film Oxidation Mitigation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anti rust carbenes: A 2&#8197;nm thick nanolayer was deposited on a Cu film by selective electrochemical deposition and on&#8208;surface polymerization of an alkyne&#8208;functionalized N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene. Nanolayer formation inhibited copper oxidation under elevated temperatures and alkaline conditions.







Abstract
The wide use of copper is limited by its rapid oxidation. Main oxidation mitigation approaches involve alloying or surface passivation technologies. However, surface alloying often modifies the physical properties of copper, while surface passivation is characterized by limited thermal and chemical stability. Herein, we demonstrate an electrochemical approach for surface&#8208;anchoring of an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) nanolayer on a copper electrode by electro&#8208;deposition of alkyne&#8208;functionalized imidazolium cations. Water reduction reaction generated a high concentration of hydroxide ions that induced deprotonation of imidazolium cations and self&#8208;assembly of NHCs on the copper electrode. In addition, alkyne group deprotonation enabled on&#8208;surface polymerization by coupling surface&#8208;anchored and solvated NHCs, which resulted in a 2&#8197;nm thick NHC&#8208;nanolayer. Copper film coated with a NHC&#8208;nanolayer demonstrated high oxidation resistance at elevated temperatures and under alkaline conditions.

         <title>Slow Synthesis Methodology&#8208;Directed Immiscible Octahedral PdxRh1&#8722;x Dual&#8208;Atom&#8208;Site Catalysts for Superior Three&#8208;Way Catalytic Activities over Rh</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel synthetic methodology was established by diminishing the differences in reduction rates for the precursor systems to prepare homogeneous RhxPd1&#8722;x solid solutions as a dual&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalyst. The Rh&#8722;Pd dual&#8208;atom sites in Pd0.1Rh0.9 and Pd0.3Rh0.7 could activate CO and NO in three&#8208;way catalytic reactions, and showed superior activities over pure Rh.







Abstract
This study provided an effective strategy to construct dual&#8208;atom sites by solid&#8211;solution alloying. A slow synthesis methodology was established for the solid&#8211;solution preparations as dual&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts. The atomic&#8208;level homogeneous PdxRh1&#8722;x dual&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts were successfully synthesized over the whole composition range, as evidenced by X&#8208;ray powder diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscope energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy mapping measurements. The challenging morphology formation in the immiscible alloys was achieved by an energy&#8208;controlling process as the octahedral Rh&#8208;rich alloys. The Pd0.3Rh0.7 dual&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalyst had unique surface states to activate the key reactants of CO and NO in the complex three&#8208;way catalytic reactions, and it performed significantly better than pure Rh.

         <title>Chemiexcitation&#8208;Triggered Prodrug Activation for Targeted Carbon Monoxide Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photolysis&#8208;based prodrug strategy can address some critical drug delivery issues, which otherwise are very challenging to tackle with traditional prodrug strategy. However, the need for external light irradiation significantly hampers its in&#8208;vivo application due to the poor light accessibility of deep tissue. Herein, we propose a new strategy of chemiexcitation&#8208;triggered prodrug activation, wherein a photoresponsive prodrug is excited for drug payload release by chemiexcitation instead of &#160;photoirradiation. As such, the bond&#8208;cleavage power of photolysis can be employed to address some critical drug delivery issues while obviating the need for external light irradiation. We have established the proof of concept by the successful development of a chemiexcitation responsive carbon monoxide delivery platform, which exhibited specific CO release at the tumor site and pronounced tumor suppression effects. We anticipate that such a concept of&#160; chemiexcitation&#8208;triggered prodrug activation can be leveraged for the targeted delivery of other small molecule&#8208;based drug payloads.</dc:description>

         <title>Euglenatides, Potent Antiproliferative Cyclic Peptides Isolated from the Freshwater Photosynthetic Microalga Euglena gracilis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light and glutamic acid induced E.&#8197;gracilis to produce euglenatides with antifungal and anticancer activity. Euglenatides were also detected in E.&#8197;sanguinea and E.&#8197;mutabilis. They resemble the nemamides isolated from C.&#8197;elegans, inhibited both producing species, and represent uniquely convergent assembly&#8208;line biosynthesis between unicellular organisms and metazoans.







Abstract
By limiting the nitrogen source to glutamic acid, we isolated cyclic peptides from Euglena gracilis containing asparagine and non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids. Structure elucidation was accomplished through spectroscopic methods, mass spectrometry and chemical degradation. The euglenatides potently inhibit pathogenic fungi and cancer cell lines e.g., euglenatide B exhibiting IC50 values of 4.3&#8197;&#956;M in Aspergillus fumigatus and 0.29&#8197;&#956;M in MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer cells. In an unprecedented convergence of non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase and polyketide synthase assembly&#8208;line biosynthesis between unicellular species and the metazoan kingdom, euglenatides bear resemblance to nemamides from Caenorhabditis elegans and inhibited both producing organisms E.&#8197;gracilis and C.&#8197;elegans. By molecular network analysis, we detected over forty euglenatide&#8208;like metabolites in E.&#8197;gracilis, E.&#8197;sanguinea and E.&#8197;mutabilis, suggesting an important biological role for these natural products.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;Dienyl and Allyl Esters from Propargyl Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented catalyst&#8208;controlled regiodivergent strategy has been developed that allows efficient access to structurally diverse 1,3&#8208;dienyl and allyl esters from common propargyl esters with high regio&#8208; and stereochemical outcomes. The ligand backbone is crucial for the regioselectivity pattern, enabling the palladium catalyst to involve electrophilic metal catalysis or sequential oxidative addition&#8211;reductive elimination pathway.







Abstract
Catalyst&#8208;controlled regiodivergent catalysis is a vital chemical tool that allows efficient access to large collections of structurally diverse molecules from a common precursor but remains a challenge. We report a catalyst&#8208;controlled, tunable, and predictable regiodivergency in transforming the internal aliphatic propargyl esters into diverse libraries of highly substituted 1,3&#8208;dienyl and allyl products by Pd&#8208;catalysis. Depending on the ligand employed, the palladium catalyst can involve two typical approaches: electrophilic palladium catalysis and a sequential oxidation additive&#8211;reductive elimination pathway. This regiodivergent protocol endows facile access to four regioisomers with high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity from the common propargyl esters. In terms of synthetic utility, a notable feature of this protocol is amenable to structural diversification of bioactive relevant molecules, enabling rapid assembly of many useful structural analogs of pharmaceutical candidates.

         <title>Rational Design of Silicon&#8208;Based Zinc Ionophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general approach to rationally design ZnII ionophores from ZnII chelator by incorporation of silyl&#8208;based groups is reported. These ionophores were more potent than several reported ZnII ionophores. Furthermore, these ZnII ionophores demonstrated selective antibacterial activity and lower mammalian cell toxicity compared to the known ionophore, pyrithione.







Abstract
Ionophores transport ions across biological membranes and have wide&#8208;ranging applications, but a platform for their rapid development does not exist. We report a platform for developing ionophores from metal&#8208;ion chelators, which are readily available with wide&#8208;ranging affinities and specificities, and structural data that can aid rational design. Specifically, we fine&#8208;tuned the binding affinity and lipophilicity of a ZnII&#8208;chelating ligand by introducing silyl groups proximal to the ZnII&#8208;binding pocket, which generated ionophores that performed better than most of the currently known ZnII ionophores. Furthermore, these silicon&#8208;based ionophores were specific for ZnII over other metals and exhibited better antibacterial activity and less toxicity to mammalian cells than several known ZnII ionophores, including pyrithione. These studies establish rational design principles for the rapid development of potent and specific ionophores and a new class of antibacterial agents.

         <title>Single&#8208;Cell Quantification of a Highly Biocompatible Dinuclear Iridium(III) Complex for Photocatalytic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;cell plasma mass spectrometry was applied for the rapid, label&#8208;free quantification of a dinuclear IrIII photocatalyst at the single&#8208;cell level. Ir2 exhibited high cellular uptake and retention efficiency along with long&#8208;wavelength light absorption. In vivo, biocompatible Ir2 showed a lysosome&#8208;targeting multimodal anticancer mechanism of action via its unique photocatalytic oxidation of amino acids and the co&#8208;enzymes NAD(P)H.







Abstract
Quantifying the content of metal&#8208;based anticancer drugs within single cancer cells remains a challenge. Here, we used single&#8208;cell inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry to study the uptake and retention of mononuclear (Ir1) and dinuclear (Ir2) IrIII photoredox catalysts. This method allowed rapid and precise quantification of the drug in individual cancer cells. Importantly, Ir2 showed a significant synergism but not an additive effect for NAD(P)H photocatalytic oxidation. The lysosome&#8208;targeting Ir2 showed low dark toxicity in vitro and in vivo. Ir2 exhibited high photocatalytic therapeutic efficiency at 525&#8197;nm with an excellent photo&#8208;index in vitro and in tumor&#8208;bearing mice model. Interestingly, the photocatalytic anticancer profile of the dinuclear Ir2 was much better than the mononuclear Ir1, indicating for the first time that dinuclear metal&#8208;based photocatalysts can be applied for photocatalytic anticancer treatment.

Importantly, &lt;b&gt;Ir2&lt;/b&gt; showed a significant synergism but not an additive effect for NAD(P)H photocatalytic oxidation. The lysosome-targeting &lt;b&gt;Ir2&lt;/b&gt; showed low dark toxicity in vitro and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;b&gt;Ir2&lt;/b&gt; exhibited high photocatalytic therapeutic efficiency at 525&#8197;nm with an excellent photo-index in vitro and in tumor-bearing mice model. Interestingly, the photocatalytic anticancer profile of the dinuclear &lt;b&gt;Ir2&lt;/b&gt; was much better than the mononuclear &lt;b&gt;Ir1&lt;/b&gt;, indicating for the first time that dinuclear metal-based photocatalysts can be applied for photocatalytic anticancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Spectroscopic Characterization and Theoretical Calculations Identify Partially Reduced ZnO1&#8722;x/Cu Interfaces for Methanol Synthesis from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;pressure in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy disclosed the structure evolution of isolated Zn species to oxygen&#8208;deficient ZnO ensembles on an atomically dispersed ZnO/Cu catalyst during methanol synthesis from CO2. Density functional theory calculations further revealed that oxygen vacancies at the interfaces play an important role in the active site.







Abstract
The active site of the industrial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst used in CO2 hydrogenation to methanol has been debated for decades. Grand challenges remain in the characterization of structure, composition, and chemical state, both microscopically and spectroscopically, and complete theoretical calculations are limited when it comes to describing the intrinsic activity of the catalyst over the diverse range of structures that emerge under realistic conditions. Here a series of inverse model catalysts of ZnO on copper hydroxide were prepared where the size of ZnO was precisely tuned from atomically dispersed species to nanoparticles using atomic layer deposition. ZnO decoration boosted methanol formation to a rate of 877&#8197;gMeOH&#8201;kgcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with &#8776;80&#8201;% selectivity at 493&#8197;K. High pressure in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrated that the atomically dispersed ZnO species are prone to aggregate at oxygen&#8208;deficient ZnO ensembles instead of forming CuZn metal alloys. By modeling various potential active structures, density functional theory calculations and microkinetic simulations revealed that ZnO/Cu interfaces with oxygen vacancies, rather than stoichiometric interfaces, Cu and CuZn alloys were essential to catalytic activation.

         <title>Versatile Vibrational Energy Sensors for Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tool kit of non&#8208;canonical amino acids for site&#8208;resolved sensing of vibrational energy transfer (VET) in proteins is established. The actual sensor is an azide or nitrile group attached to different side chains for compatibility with different protein sites. Ultrafast spectroscopy experiments on peptides and a protein ensure comparability of the sensors, allowing for choosing the best for a given site.







Abstract
Vibrational energy transfer (VET) is emerging as key mechanism for protein functions, possibly playing an important role for energy dissipation, allosteric regulation, and enzyme catalysis. A deep understanding of VET is required to elucidate its role in such processes. Ultrafast VIS&#8208;pump/IR&#8208;probe spectroscopy can detect pathways of VET in proteins. However, the requirement of having a VET donor and a VET sensor installed simultaneously limits the possible target proteins and sites; to increase their number we compare six IR labels regarding their utility as VET sensors. We compare these labels in terms of their FTIR, and VET signature in VET donor&#8208;sensor dipeptides in different solvents. Furthermore, we incorporated four of these labels in PDZ3 to assess their capabilities in more complex systems. Our results show that different IR labels can be used interchangeably, allowing for free choice of the right label depending on the system under investigation and the methods available.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Stereoselective C(sp3)&#8722;H Glycosylation for the Synthesis of C&#8208;Glycoamino Acids and C&#8208;Glycopeptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted and copper&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective C(sp3)&#8722;H glycosylation reaction was developed for the synthesis of a wide variety of C&#8208;glycoamino acids and C&#8208;glycopeptidomimetics with good yields and excellent stereoselectivity. The mild reaction conditions are compatible with various carbohydrate substrates, as demonstrated with a series of monosaccharides and a disaccharide.







Abstract
The glycosylative modification of peptides could improve the pharmacological properties of peptide drugs and deliver them efficiently to the target sites. Compared with O&#8208;/N&#8208;glycosides, C&#8208;glycosides exhibit more metabolic stability. We here disclose the first example of visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted and Cu&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective C&#8208;glycosylation. The mild reaction conditions are compatible with various carbohydrate substrates, as demonstrated with a series of monosaccharides and a disaccharide, and are amenable to the synthesis of a wide variety of C&#8208;glycoamino acids and C&#8208;glycopeptidomimetics with good yields and excellent stereoselectivities. The dual&#8208;functional photocatalyst formed in situ via coordination of the glycine derivative and the chiral phosphine Cu complex could not only catalyze the photoredox process but also control the stereoselectivity of the glycosylation reaction.

         <title>Ultrawide Bandgap and Outstanding Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation Response by a Fluorine&#8208;Enrichment Strategy at a Transition&#8208;Metal Oxyfluoride Nonlinear Optical Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual fluorine&#8208;rich oxyfluoride K5(NbOF4)(NbF7)2, which exhibits an extremely wide band gap (5.88&#8197;eV) and a strong powder second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response (4.0&#215;KH2PO4), both being the largest values for transition&#8208;metal (TM)&#8208;centered oxyfluorides, has been successfully constructed by a fluorine&#8208;enrichment strategy for simultaneously enhancing band gap and SHG response.







Abstract
The development of nonlinear optical (NLO) materials has been hindered by competing microstructure requirements: the need to simultaneously engineer a large hyperpolarizability (a large second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG)) and a wide HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap (a wide band gap). Herein, a non&#8208;centrosymmetric transition&#8208;metal (TM) oxyfluoride K5(NbOF4)(NbF7)2 (KNOF) with an extremely high F/O ratio is constructed in high yield. KNOF exhibits an extremely wide band gap (5.88&#8197;eV) and a strong powder SHG response (4.0&#215;KH2PO4)&#8212;both being the largest values for TM&#8208;centered oxyfluorides&#8212;as well as a birefringence sufficient for applications. The dominant roles of the partially fluorinated [NbO2F4] and totally fluorinated [NbF7] groups in achieving the enlarged band gap in KNOF have been clarified by first&#8208;principles calculations. Our results suggest that maximizing the fluorine content of oxyfluorides may unlock the promise of short&#8208;wavelength&#8208;transparent materials with exceptional NLO performance.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we present a new way to encapsulation of NSC by using hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) to overcome the common causes of low therapeutic efficacy during NSC transplantation: (i) loss of stemness before transplantation, (ii) cytomembrane damage during transplantation, and (iii) apoptosis due to oxidative stress after transplantation. Porous carbon nanospheres (PCN) are doped into the HOFs shell during the process of mineralization to endow the cellular exoskeletons with hierarchical hydrogen bonds, and the ability to resist oxidative stress due to PCN with catalase and superoxide dismutase&#8208;like activities. Under NIR&#8208;II irradiation, thermal&#8208;responsive hydrogen bonds dissociate to release NSC. Stereotactic transplantation into the brain of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) mouse model further verifies our design can enhance NSC viability, promote neurogenesis and ameliorate cognitive impairment. As the first example of using HOFs to encapsulate NSC, this work may inspire design of HOFs&#8208;based exoskeleton to ameliorate neurogenesis and cognitive behavioral symptoms associated with AD.</dc:description>

         <title>An Activatable Polymeric Nanoprobe for Fluorescence and Photoacoustic Imaging of Tumor&#8208;Associated Neutrophils in Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imaging of evaluate tumor&#8208;associated neutrophils (TANs) is imperative for cancer immunotherapy but remains challenging. We herein report an activatable semiconducting polymer nanoprobe (SPCy) for near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging of neutrophil elastase (NE), a biomarker of TANs. SPCy comprises a semiconducting polymer conjugated with a hemicyanine (hemi&#8208;Cy) dye caged by a NE&#8208;cleavable peptide as the side chain. After systemic administration, SPCy passively targets the tumor and reacts with NE to &#8220;uncage&#8221; the hemi&#8208;Cy, leading to enhanced the NIRF and PA signals of the hemi&#8208;Cy but unchanged signals of the SP. Such NE&#8208;activated ratiometric NIRF and enhanced PA signals of SPCy correlate with the intratumoral population of TANs. Thus, this study not only presents the first TAN&#8208;specific PA probe, but also provides a general molecular design strategy for PA imaging of other immune&#8208;related biomarkers to facilitate screening of cancer immunotherapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>(PNSiMe3)4(NMe)6: A Robust Tetravalent Phosphaza&#8208;adamantane Scaffold for Molecular and Macromolecular Construction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetraarylmethanes and adamantanes are important rigid covalent connectors that play a four&#8208;way scaffolding role in molecular and materials chemistry. We report the synthesis of a new tetravalent phosphaza&#8208;adamantane cage, (PNSiMe  3  )  4  (NMe)  6  (  2  ), that shows high thermal, air, and redox stability due to its geometry. It nevertheless participates in covalent four&#8208;fold functionalization reactions along its periphery. The combination of a robust core and reactive corona makes  2  a convenient inorganic scaffold upon which tetrahedral molecular and macromolecular chemistry can be constructed. This potential is demonstrated by the synthesis of a tetrakis(bis(phosphine)iminium) ion (in compound  3  ) and the first all P/N poly(phosphazene) network (  5  ).</dc:description>

         <title>Investigation of the Molecular Landscape of Bacterial Aromatic Polyketides by Global Analysis of Type II Polyketide Synthases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromatic polyketides biosynthesized by microorganisms are a prominent class of natural products widely used in clinical treatments. Although genome mining approaches have accelerated the discovery of these molecules, the molecular diversity, abundance, and distribution of bacterial aromatic polyketides at a global scale remain elusive.&#160;Here, we provide a global atlas of bacterial aromatic polyketides based on large&#8208;scale analysis of type II polyketide synthases. We first established&#160;the chain length factor&#160;protein as a marker that can predict both chemical class and molecular uniqueness of the biosynthetic product, and analyzed the abundance, taxonomic distribution, estimated structural diversity, and the total number of aromatic polyketides in bacteria. We further show the identification of oryzanaphthopyrans with an unprecedented angular naphthopyran scaffold from a rare&#160;actinobacterium by genome mining guided by the global atlas. These results serve as a compass for exploiting&#160;the entire type II polyketide synthase&#8208;derived&#160;aromatic polyketides in bacteria.</dc:description>

         <title>Protocellular CRISPR/Cas&#8208;based Diffusive Communication Using Transcriptional RNA Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cellular functions in living cells are facilitated by diffusible molecular signals that are sensed and processed by receiver cells and can control intracellular pathways. Protocells containing enzyme&#8208;driven biomolecular circuits that can process and exchange information offer a promising approach for mimicking cellular features and developing molecular information platforms for use in molecular data storage and diagnostics. Here, we employ synthetic transcriptional circuits together with CRISPR/Cas&#8208;based DNA processing inside semipermeable protein&#8208;polymer microcompartments. We first establish a transcriptional protocell that can be activated by external DNA strands and produce functional RNA aptamers. Subsequently, we engineer the transcriptional module to generate short RNA strands functioning as diffusive signals that can be sensed by neighboring protocells and trigger the activation of internalized DNA probes or localization of Cas nucleases. Our results highlight the opportunities to combine CRISPR/Cas machinery and DNA nanotechnology for protocellular communication and provide a step towards the development of protocells capable of distributed molecular information processing.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;based Evolution of G protein&#8208;biased &#956;&#8208;opioid Receptor Agonists</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The &#956;&#8208;opioid receptor (&#956;OR) is the major target for opioid analgesics. Activation of &#956;OR initiates signaling through G protein pathways as well as through &#946;&#8208;arrestin recruitment. &#956;OR agonists that are biased towards G protein signaling pathways demonstrate diminished side effects. PZM21, discovered by computational docking, is a G protein biased &#956;OR agonist. Here we report the cryoEM structure of PZM21 bound &#956;OR in complex with G  i  protein. Structure&#8208;based evolution led to multiple PZM21 analogs with more pronounced G  i  protein bias and increased lipophilicity to improve CNS penetration. Among them, FH210 shows extremely low potency and efficacy for arrestin recruitment. We further determined the cryoEM structure of FH210 bound to &#956;OR in complex with G  i  protein and confirmed its expected binding pose. The structural and pharmacological studies reveal a potential mechanism to reduce &#946;&#8208;arrestin recruitment by the &#956;OR, and hold promise for developing next&#8208;generation analgesics with fewer adverse effects.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Water&#8208;soluble synthetic transition metal catalysts have been studied extensively for many reactions, but for olefin polymerization such catalysts have been lacking. We report here a straightforward synthesis of phosphinephenolate Ni(II) catalysts endowed permanently with a hydrophilic sulfonate moiety bound to the chelating ligand. These catalysts' hydrophilic active sites promote aqueous ethylene polymerization with high activity (TOF up to 6.3 &#215; 10  4  mol  Ethylene  mol  Ni  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  ) to high molecular weight polyethylene (HDPE), with half&#8208;lives on the order of hours also at elevated temperatures.

         <title>LiNbO3&#8208;type Polar Antiferromagnet InVO3 Synthesized under&#160;High&#8208;Pressure Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ambient pressure cation disordered InVO  3  bixbyite has been predicted to form a GdFeO  3  &#8208;type perovskite phase under high&#8208;pressure and high temperature. Contrary to the expectation, InVO  3  was found to crystallize in the polar LiNbO  3  &#8208;type structure with a calculated spontaneous polarization as large as 74 &#956;C/cm  2  . Antiferromagnetic coupling of V  3+  magnetic moments and a cooperative magnetic ground state below about 10 K coupled with a polar structure suggest an intriguing ground state of the novel LiNbO  3  &#8208;type high&#8208;pressure InVO  3  structure.</dc:description>

         <title>A New Strategy to Fight Metallodrug Resistance: Mitochondria&#8208;Relevant Treatment through Mitophagy to Inhibit Metabolic Adaptations of Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metabolic adaptations can help cancer cells to escape from chemotherapeutics, mainly involving autophagy and ATP production. Herein, we report a new rhein&#8208;based cyclometalated Ir(III) complex,  Ir&#8208;Rhein  , that can accurately target mitochondria and effectively inhibit metabolic adaptations. The complex  Ir&#8208;Rhein  induces severe mitochondrial damage and initiates mitophagy to reduce the number of mitochondria and subsequently inhibit both mitochondrial and glycolytic bioenergetics, which eventually leads to ATP starvation death. Moreover,  Ir&#8208;Rhein  can overcome cisplatin resistance. In a co&#8208;incubation experiment, a 3D tumor spheroids experiment and transcriptome analysis reveal that  Ir&#8208;Rhein  shows promising antiproliferation performance for cisplatin&#8208;resistant cancer cells with the regulation of platinum resistance&#8208;related transporters. To the best of our knowledge, this is a new strategy to overcome metallodrug resistance with a mitochondria&#8208;relevant treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Bifunctionalized Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Pore&#8208;Size&#8208;Dependent Enantioselective Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porosity is a fundamental property of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). However, the role of the pore size has always been underestimated in MOF&#8208;based luminescent sensors for enantioselective sensing. The construction of isoreticular MOFs (IRMOFs) with variable pore sizes and the synergy between chirality and luminescence is challenging. Herein, a general strategy was developed to introduce chirality into two well&#8208;known IRMOF&#8208;74 analogs with nanochannels of identical shapes but different pore sizes by functionalizing the open metal site under mild conditions. To enhance the detection accuracy, a second luminescent center was introduced into the IRMOF&#8208;74 system to achieve ratiometric sensing. The two bifunctionalized IRMOF&#8208;74 compounds exhibited pore&#8208;size&#8208;dependent sensing performance for enantiomers. This study not only provides a convenient method to construct chiral MOFs as advanced sensing materials but also reveals the fundamental of the pores in MOF&#8208;based luminescent sensors.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered High&#8208;Affinity Binding of Tetramethylammonium over Potassium Ions by [18]crown&#8208;6 in a Tetrahedral Anion Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven assembly from an azobenzene&#8208;functionalized bis&#8208;bis(urea) ligand (Lazo) with phosphate anion affords the first photoactive A4L6&#8208;type tetrahedral cage. The tetrahedral cage can reversibly trap two TMA+ cations and one [18]crown&#8208;6 molecule with an unusually high affinity accompanied by the release/capture of K+ ion from [K([18]crown&#8208;6)]+ under irradiation/heating.







Abstract
An azobenzene&#8208;functionalized bis&#8208;bis(urea) ligand (Lazo) and phosphate anion assemble to give the first photoactive &#8220;aniono&#8221; constructs, tetrahedron (A4L6) and helicate (A2L3), which readily undergo interconversion through cis&#8208;trans isomerization of the azo group under irradiation/heating. Most strikingly, the tetrahedral cage can accommodate an [18]crown&#8208;6 molecule, which can capture two tetramethylammonium (TMA+) ions with an unusually high affinity, even capable of replacing K+ in [K([18]crown&#8208;6)]+ to form a {(TMA)2
([18]crown&#8208;6)}
cage &#8220;Russian doll&#8221; structure. Thus, the current work may provide a model for the light&#8208;driven binding and exchange of the biologically important K+ and TMA+ ions.

         <title>A Nonenzymatic Analog of Pyrimidine Nucleobase Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthetic reactions that convert aspartate into orotate, the precursor to pyrimidine nucleobases, occur nonenzymatically and without photochemistry at 60&#8201;&#176;C in the presence of metals, giving insight into how these metabolic pathways may have emerged at the origin of life.







Abstract
Metabolic theories for the origin of life posit that inorganic catalysts enabled self&#8208;organized chemical precursors to the pathways of metabolism, including those that make genetic molecules. Recently, experiments showing nonenzymatic versions of a number of core metabolic pathways have started to support this idea. However, experimental demonstrations of nonenzymatic reaction sequences along the de novo ribonucleotide biosynthesis pathways are limited. Here we show that all three reactions of pyrimidine nucleobase biosynthesis that convert aspartate to orotate proceed at 60&#8201;&#176;C without photochemistry under aqueous conditions in the presence of metals such as Cu2+ and Mn4+. Combining reactions into one&#8208;pot variants is also possible. Life may not have invented pyrimidine nucleobase biosynthesis from scratch, but simply refined existing nonenzymatic reaction channels. This work is a first step towards uniting metabolic theories of life's origin with those centered around genetic molecules.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Catalytic Hydrogenolysis of Silyl Triflates and Halides into Hydrosilanes**

The metal&#8208;free hydrogenolysis of silyl triflates and halides into hydrosilanes is unlocked. This is enabled by the use of boron&#8208;based organocatalysts that are competitive with metal catalysts.







Abstract
The metal&#8208;free catalytic hydrogenolysis of silyl triflates and halides (I, Br) to hydrosilanes is unlocked by using arylborane Lewis acids as catalysts. In the presence of a nitrogen base, the catalyst acts as a Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP) able to split H2 and generate a boron hydride intermediate capable of reducing (pseudo)halosilanes. This metal&#8208;free organocatalytic system is competitive with metal&#8208;based catalysts and enables the formation of a variety of hydrosilanes at room temperature in high yields (&gt;85&#8201;%) under a low pressure of H2 (&#8804;10&#8197;bar).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The metal-free catalytic hydrogenolysis of silyl triflates and halides (I, Br) to hydrosilanes is unlocked by using arylborane Lewis acids as catalysts. In the presence of a nitrogen base, the catalyst acts as a Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP) able to split H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and generate a boron hydride intermediate capable of reducing (pseudo)halosilanes. This metal-free organocatalytic system is competitive with metal-based catalysts and enables the formation of a variety of hydrosilanes at room temperature in high yields (&amp;gt;85&#8201;%) under a low pressure of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&#8804;10&#8197;bar).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organophotocatalytic Regioselective C&#8722;H Alkylation of Electron&#8208;Rich Arenes Using Activated and Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a metal&#8208;free photocatalyzed site&#8208; and regioselective C&#8722;H alkylation of electron&#8208;rich arenes at room temperature using alkenes as the alkylating reagents is described for the first time. The alkylation proceeds in the absence of any directing groups, and tolerates both activated and unactivated alkenes to deliver alkylated arenes with broad functional&#8208;group tolerance, providing an alternative to the classical Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation reaction.







Abstract
Direct alkylation of the C&#8722;H bond arenes in a selective manner is a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, a metal&#8208;free photocatalytic regioselective C&#8722;H alkylation method for electron&#8208;rich arenes with both activated and unactivated alkenes was developed. The reaction tolerates a wide range of aromatic rings with diverse substitution patterns, as well as terminal and internal alkenes, providing a general and straightforward metal&#8208;free method for C&#8722;C bond formation from inert C&#8722;H bonds. Moreover, alkynes are also compatible to give the C&#8722;H vinylation of electron&#8208;rich arenes.

         <title>Exovinylene Cyclic Carbonates: Multifaceted CO2&#8208;Based Building Blocks for Modern Chemistry and Polymer Science</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exovinylene cyclic carbonates are emerging multifaceted scaffolds in organic chemistry and polymer sciences. This Review covers catalytic concepts for the synthesis of these heterocycles from CO2 and describes the large portfolio of organic synthons and highly relevant functional polymers that are now accessible via their smart chemical transformation, generally under mild conditions.







Abstract
Carbon dioxide is a renewable, inexhaustible, and cheap alternative to fossil resources for the production of fine chemicals and plastics. It can notably be converted into exovinylene cyclic carbonates, unique synthons gaining momentum for the preparation of an impressive range of important organic molecules and functional polymers, in reactions proceeding with 100&#8201;% atom economy under mild operating conditions in most cases. This Review summarizes the recent advances in their synthesis with particular attention on describing the catalysts needed for their preparation and discussing the unique reactivity of these CO2&#8208;based heterocycles for the construction of diverse organic building blocks and (functional) polymers. We also discuss the challenges and the future perspectives in the field.

         <title>Hierarchically Nanostructured Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte for Flexible Rechargeable Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Safe, environmentally&#8208;benign, hierarchically nanostructured CCNF&#8208;PDIL solid&#8208;state electrolytes with reinforced concrete architecture are constructed by nanoconfined polymerization of dual&#8208;cation ionic liquid (PDIL, concrete) within a robust three&#8208;dimensional porous cationic cellulose nanofiber matrix (CCNF, reinforcing steel) for flexible zinc&#8211;air batteries.







Abstract
The construction of safe and environmentally&#8208;benign solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with intrinsic hydroxide ion&#8208;conduction for flexible zinc&#8211;air batteries is highly desirable yet extremely challenging. Herein, hierarchically nanostructured CCNF&#8208;PDIL SSEs with reinforced concrete architecture are constructed by nanoconfined polymerization of dual&#8208;cation ionic liquid (PDIL, concrete) within a robust three&#8208;dimensional porous cationic cellulose nanofiber matrix (CCNF, reinforcing steel), where plenty of penetrating ion&#8208;conductive channels are formed and undergo dynamic self&#8208;rearrangement under different hydrated levels. The CCNF&#8208;PDIL SSEs synchronously exhibit good flexibility, mechanical robustness, superhigh ion conductivity of 286.5&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1, and decent water uptake. The resultant flexible solid&#8208;state zinc&#8211;air batteries deliver a high&#8208;power density of 135&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a specific capacity of 775&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and an ultralong cycling stability with continuous operation of 240&#8197;hours for 720 cycles, far outperforming those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art solid&#8208;state batteries. The marriage of biomaterials with the diversity of ionic liquids creates enormous opportunities to construct advanced SSEs for solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly of Adhesive and Conductive Gels with Anion&#8208;Coordinated Triple Helicate Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of C2&#8208;symmetric anion&#8208;binding ligands equipped with ortho&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bridged bis(urea) and amine/amide ends were designed, which could firstly self&#8208;assemble into triple helicates by coordination with phosphate ions and subsequently form gels through multiple intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The obtained gels exhibit effective and stable adhesive properties, selective wettability, and conductivity.







Abstract
The fabrication of anion&#8208;coordinated assemblies into functional soft materials remains a major challenge. To this end, four C2&#8208;symmetric anion&#8208;binding ligands equipped with ortho&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bridged bis(urea) and amine or amide ends were designed, which generated A2L3 triple helical architectures upon self&#8208;assembly with phosphate ions. Hierarchical intermolecular hydrogen bonds among the terminal amine/amide groups and urea moieties resulted in the formation of functional gels. The obtained gels were further applied for conductive adhesion between different surfaces, displaying excellent flexibility and selective wettability. The viscoelastic gels constructed from anion&#8208;coordinated assemblies described in this work represent the first example of a new class of anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven smart materials.

         <title>Time&#8208;Resolved In&#8197;Situ Monitoring of Mechanochemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;resolved in&#8197;situ analysis opens the black box. Within the last few years, time&#8208;resolved in&#8197;situ (TRIS) analysis has revolutionized the field of mechanochemistry. This Minireview highlights the insights gained in mechanochemical transformations, thereby paving the way for future academic and industrial breakthroughs of mechanochemisty as a green and sustainable approach for designing new materials.







Abstract
Mechanochemical transformations offer environmentally benign synthesis routes, whilst enhancing both the speed and selectivity of reactions. In this regard, mechanochemistry promises to transform the way in which chemistry is done in both academia and industry but is greatly hindered by a current lack of mechanistic understanding. The continued development and use of time&#8208;resolved in&#8197;situ (TRIS) approaches to monitor mechanochemical reactions provides a new dimension to elucidate these fascinating transformations. We here discuss recent trends in method development that have pushed the boundaries of mechanochemical research. New features of mechanochemical reactions obtained by TRIS techniques are subsequently discussed, which sheds light on how different TRIS approaches have been used. Emphasis is placed on the strength of combining complementary techniques. Finally, we outline our views on the potential of TRIS methods in mechanochemical research, towards establishing a new, environmentally benign paradigm in the chemical sciences.

The continued development and use of time-resolved in&#8197;situ (TRIS) approaches to monitor mechanochemical reactions provides a new dimension to elucidate these fascinating transformations. We here discuss recent trends in method development that have pushed the boundaries of mechanochemical research. New features of mechanochemical reactions obtained by TRIS techniques are subsequently discussed, which sheds light on how different TRIS approaches have been used. Emphasis is placed on the strength of combining complementary techniques. Finally, we outline our views on the potential of TRIS methods in mechanochemical research, towards establishing a new, environmentally benign paradigm in the chemical sciences.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Generation of Hydrogen Peroxide and Formate by an Organic Polymer Dots Photocatalyst in Alkaline Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
H2O2 and formate were produced by employing organic polymer dots as the photocatalyst in alkaline conditions. The H2O2 production rate reached up to 188&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 and EQEs were 30&#8201;% (5&#8197;min) and 14&#8201;% (75&#8197;min). A reaction mechanism is proposed.







Abstract
A photocatalyst comprising binary organic polymer dots (Pdots) was prepared. The Pdots were constructed from poly(9,9&#8208;dioctylfluorene&#8208;alt&#8208;benzothiadiazole), as an electron donor, and 1&#8208;[3&#8208;(methoxycarbonyl)propyl]&#8208;1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;[6.6]C61, as an electron acceptor. The photocatalyst produces H2O2 in alkaline conditions (1&#8197;M KOH) with a production rate of up to 188&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1. The external quantum efficiencies were 30&#8201;% (5&#8197;min) and 14&#8201;% (75&#8197;min) at 450&#8197;nm. Furthermore, photo&#8208;oxidation of methanol by Pdots, followed by a disproportionation reaction and an oxidation reaction, produced the high&#8208;value chemical formate. On the basis of various spectroscopic and electrochemical measurements, the photophysical processes of the system were studied in detail and a reaction mechanism was proposed.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Addressable Single&#8208;Molecule Junctions Incorporating a Persistent Organic Radical**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A verdazyl radical, stable in its open&#8208;shell state at ambient conditions, has been used to fabricate single&#8208;molecule devices that show enhanced charge&#8208;transport efficiency, electrochemical transistor behaviour, and rectification. All the properties arise from the presence of an unpaired electron, strongly localised on the verdazyl core.







Abstract
Integrating radical (open&#8208;shell) species into non&#8208;cryogenic nanodevices is key to unlocking the potential of molecular electronics. While many efforts have been devoted to this issue, in the absence of a chemical/electrochemical potential the open&#8208;shell character is generally lost in contact with the metallic electrodes. Herein, single&#8208;molecule devices incorporating a 6&#8208;oxo&#8208;verdazyl persistent radical have been fabricated using break&#8208;junction techniques. The open&#8208;shell character is retained at room temperature, and electrochemical gating permits in&#8197;situ reduction to a closed&#8208;shell anionic state in a single&#8208;molecule transistor configuration. Furthermore, electronically driven rectification arises from bias&#8208;dependent alignment of the open&#8208;shell resonances. The integration of radical character, transistor&#8208;like switching, and rectification in a single molecular component paves the way to further studies of the electronic, magnetic, and thermoelectric properties of open&#8208;shell species.

         <title>A High&#8208;Throughput Approach to Repurposing Olefin Polymerization Catalysts for Polymer Upcycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over the past half&#8208;century thousands of early metal precatalyst derivatives have been created for polyolefin synthesis. These same catalysts, under the appropriate conditions have potential to degrade polymers. The large number of precatalysts available requires a high&#8208;throughput approach to accelerate discovery. Herein, we present the discovery of several active catalysts for the degradation of polybutadiene using high&#8208;throughput.







Abstract
Efficient and economical plastic waste upcycling relies on the development of catalysts capable of polymer degradation. A systematic high&#8208;throughput screening of twenty&#8208;eight polymerization catalyst precursors, belonging to the catalyst families of metallocenes, ansa&#8208;metallocenes, and hemi&#8208; and post&#8208;metallocenes, in cis&#8208;1,4&#8208;polybutadiene (PB) degradation reveals, for the first time, important structure&#8211;activity correlations. The upcycling conditions involve activation of the catalysts (at 0.18&#8201;% catalyst loading) with tri&#8208;iso&#8208;butyl aluminum at 50&#8201;&#176;C in toluene. The data indicate the ability to degrade PB is a general reactivity profile of neutral group 4 metal hydrides. A simple quantitative&#8208;structure activity relationship (QSAR) model utilizing two descriptors for the distribution of steric bulk in the active pocket and one measuring the metal ion electrophilicity reveals the degradation ability improves with increased but not overbearing steric congestion and lower electrophilicity.

         <title>Efficient Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia with Copper&#8208;Supported Rhodium Cluster and Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel copper nanowire supported rhodium cluster and single&#8208;atom electrocatalyst (Rh@Cu) for nitrate reduction reaction (NITRR) was designed. Benefiting from the catalytic cooperation between Rh and Cu, whereby Rh activates the hydrogenation of the *NO intermediate on Cu, Rh@Cu systems achieve a Faradaic efficiency up to 93&#8201;% at &#8722;0.2&#8197;V vs. RHE and a record ammonia yield rate of 1.27&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NITRR) provides a promising solution for restoring the imbalance in the global nitrogen cycle while enabling a sustainable and decentralized route to source ammonia. Here, we demonstrate a novel electrocatalyst for NITRR consisting of Rh clusters and single&#8208;atoms dispersed onto Cu nanowires (NWs), which delivers a partial current density of 162&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for NH3 production and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 93&#8201;% at &#8722;0.2&#8197;V vs. RHE. The highest ammonia yield rate reached a record value of 1.27&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Detailed investigations by electron paramagnetic resonance, in situ infrared spectroscopy, differential electrochemical mass spectrometry and density functional theory modeling suggest that the high activity originates from the synergistic catalytic cooperation between Rh and Cu sites, whereby adsorbed hydrogen on Rh site transfers to vicinal *NO intermediate species adsorbed on Cu promoting the hydrogenation and ammonia formation.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetric Lactonization of Alkynylmalonic Acids Enabled by Chiral Bifunctional P,N ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The gold&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization of alkynylmalonic acids proceed smoothly to give chiral lactones with high yield and ee. Control experiments and DFT calculations indicate that the amino group of the ligands and the alcohol additives play key roles in the control of enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Due to the linear coordination nature of gold(I) catalysts, achieving high enantiocontrol in asymmetric gold catalysis is a great challenge. To improve the enantiocontrol of gold catalysis, an ion&#8208;pairing strategy was therefore proposed. A series of bifunctional P,N ligands based on chiral spirocyclic and biaryl scaffolds were synthesized and applied in the gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric lactonization of alkynylmalonic acids. A wide range of chiral lactones containing an &#945;&#8208;position quaternary stereocenter were synthesized with high yields, excellent regioselectivity and enantioselectivity under mild reaction conditions. The synthetic utilities of the current reaction were demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale synthesis and transformations of chiral lactones. The origin of enantioselectivity and the role of the alcohol additive were elucidated via control experiments and DFT calculations.

         <title>Nickel/Copper&#8208;Cocatalyzed Asymmetric Benzylation of Aldimine Esters for the Enantioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Quaternary Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Ni/Cu cocatalyzed asymmetric benzylation of aldimine esters has been developed. DFT calculations revealed that the strong electrophilicity of the &#951;3&#8208;benzylnickel intermediate enabled the reaction to proceed smoothly under base&#8208;free conditions. The method was applied to the synthesis of BIRT&#8208;377 analogues, the key intermediate of PD154075 and CI&#8208;988.







Abstract
The first asymmetric Ni/Cu cocatalyzed benzylation of aldimine esters is reported. A series of benzyl&#8208;substituted &#945;&#8208;quaternary amino acids could be synthesized in high yield and with high levels of enantioselectivity (up to 90&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee). The experimental and theoretical calculation results suggested that the strong electrophilicity of the &#951;3&#8208;benzylnickel intermediate is crucial for the high reactivity, enabling the reaction under base&#8208;free conditions. Furthermore, this method has been applied to the synthesis of the cell adhesion inhibitor BIRT&#8208;377 analogues, and the key intermediate of the NK1 receptor antagonist PD154075 and CCK&#8208;B receptor antagonist CI&#8208;988.

         <title>Enantioselective Seleno&#8208;Michael Addition Reactions Catalyzed by a Chiral Bifunctional N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene with Noncovalent Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective Michael addition reaction of alkyl selenols to enones is reported. The development of a chiral bifunctional N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)/thiourea catalyst was key in obtaining the chiral &#946;&#8208;seleno ketones with remarkable selectivity.







Abstract
The Michael reaction is a conjugate addition and is one of the most powerful methods with which to prepare functional molecules with a &#946;&#8208;stereogenic center. Despite its success in the formation of various asymmetric carbon&#8211;carbon and carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds, enantioselective seleno&#8208;Michael addition remains essentially unexplored. We report here a highly enantioselective Michael addition reaction of alkyl selenols to enones. This method conveniently introduces a Se atom to an electron&#8208;deficient double bond asymmetrically. A chiral bifunctional N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)/thiourea catalyst was developed as a key ingredient that delivers chiral &#946;&#8208;seleno ketones with remarkable selectivity. This new catalyst and its mode of action support broad applications in the catalytic activation of nucleophilic reactions.

         <title>Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Conversion at an InSn&#8208;Enriched Liquid&#8208;Metal Electrode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work a Ga&#8208;based liquid metal electrocatalyst is developed for the electrochemical conversion of nitrate and nitrite ions to ammonia at room temperature where InSn is identified as the active site for the reaction.







Abstract
The renewable energy driven electrochemical conversion of nitrates to ammonia is emerging as a viable route for the creation of this hydrogen carrier. However, the creation of highly efficient electrocatalysts that show prolonged stability is an ongoing challenge. Here we show that room temperature liquid metal Galinstan can be used as an efficient and stable electrocatalyst for nitrate conversion to ammonia achieving rates of up to 2335&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a Faradaic efficiency of 100&#8201;%. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental observation indicated the activity is due to InSn alloy enrichment within the liquid metal that occurs during the electrocatalytic reaction. This high selectivity for NH3 is also due to additional suppression of the competing hydrogen evolution reaction at the identified In3Sn active site. This work adds to the increasing applicability of liquid metals based on Ga for clean energy technologies.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective &#947;&#8208;Arylation of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;Unsaturated Butenolides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective &#947;&#8208;selective arylation of &#946;, &#947;&#8208;unsaturated butenolides is reported. The P&#8208;chiral phosphine ligand&#8208;AntPhos is essential for the observed high &#947;&#8208;selectivity, excellent enantioselectivity and good yields.







Abstract
&#947;&#8208;Butenolide and &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone scaffolds are two types of important core structures in numerous natural products and bioactive targets. However, methods to construct the chiral quaternary arylated &#947;&#8208;butenolide are rarely explored. We herein report an efficient Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective &#947;&#8208;arylation of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated butenolides with aryl bromides, which shows high &#947;&#8208;selectivity, good functional group tolerance and excellent enantioselectivity. Notably, this protocol also allows for facile construction of tricyclic tetrahydroindolines and tetrahydroisoquinolinones in one step. DFT calculations are consistent with the experimental results, suggesting that the &#947;&#8208;arylation is favoured over the &#945;&#8208;arylation. Finally, this method is applied to the rapid synthesis of natural product (R)&#8208;(+)&#8208;boivinianin&#8197;A.

         <title>Increasing the Number of Aluminum Atoms in T3 Sites of a Mordenite Zeolite by Low&#8208;Pressure SiCl4 Treatment to Catalyze Dimethyl Ether Carbonylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;pressure SiCl4 treatment (LPST) strategy to selectively relocate zeolite framework aluminum atoms into the desired positions is reported in the Research Article by Zhengxi Yu, Zhongmin Liu et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202116990). After treatment, the undesired framework aluminum atoms in the 12&#8208;MR channels of a mordenite zeolite migrate to the desired T3 sites to increase the number of favorable active sites.

         <title>Active Mechanical Threading by a Molecular Motor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular motor setup allowing to harness the trajectory of directional motor rotation for an active mechanical threading process is presented by Henry Dube et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202201882). The motor is embedded into a macrocycle and its indane&#8208;based rotor fragment then serves as &#8220;revolving door&#8221; in the light&#8208;driven&#8211;rotation. In this way a process akin to macroscopic threading of a needle is miniaturized to the molecular level offering a first entry point to mechanical molecular knitting or weaving processes.

         <title>Small Molecules Modulate Liquid&#8208;to&#8208;Solid Transitions in Phase&#8208;Separated Tau Condensates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small molecules with hydrophobic groups (yellow tetrahedral sticks) interact with Tau proteins (red), stabilizing Liquid&#8211;Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS) condensates in the liquid&#8208;like phase. Tau proteins start to interact with neighboring Tau molecules and aggregate into the solid&#8208;like state in the droplet. Salting out ions following the Hofmeister series facilitate the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition.







Abstract
In Tau protein condensates formed by the Liquid&#8211;Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS) process, liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transitions lead to the formation of fibrils implicated in Alzheimer's disease. Here, by tracking two contacting Tau&#8208;rich droplets using a simple and nonintrusive video microscopy, we found that the halftime of the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition in the Tau condensate is affected by the Hofmeister series according to the solvation energy of anions. After dissecting functional groups of physiologically relevant small molecules using a multivariate approach, we found that charged groups facilitate the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition in a manner similar to the Hofmeister effect, whereas hydrophobic alkyl chains and aromatic rings inhibit the transition. Our results not only elucidate the driving force of the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition in Tau condensates, but also provide guidelines to design small molecules to modulate this important transition for many biological functions for the first time.

         <title>Ionic Liquid Stabilizes Olefin Facilitated Transport Membranes Against Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Separation of olefins from their paraffin analogs relies on energy&#8208;intensive cryogenic distillation. Facilitated transport&#8208;based membranes that reversibly and selectively bind olefins, but not paraffins, could save considerable amounts of energy. However, the chemical instability of the silver ion olefin&#8208;binding carriers in such membranes has been a longstanding roadblock for this approach. We discovered long&#8208;term carrier stability against extended exposure to hydrogen, a common contaminant in such streams. Based on UV&#8208;vis absorption and Raman spectroscopy, along with XRD analysis results, certain ionic liquids solubilize silver ions, and anion aggregates surrounding the silver ion carriers greatly attenuate their reduction by hydrogen. Here, we report the stability of olefin/paraffin separation properties under continuous exposure to high pressure hydrogen, which addresses a critical technical roadblock in membrane&#8208;based olefin/paraffin separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Pyridine&#8208;Pyridone Foldamer Channels as M2&#8208;Like Artificial Proton Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, completely abiotic channel systems that concurrently reproduce high selectivity and high permeation rate of natural protein channels are rare. Here, we provide one such biomimetic channel system, i.e., a novel family of helically folded hybrid amide foldamers, serving as powerful artificial proton channels that mimic key transport features of the exceptionally selective Matrix&#8208;2 (M2) proton channel. Possessing an angstrom&#8208;scale tubular pore of 3 &#197; across, these artificial channels transport protons at a rate 22% and 10 times faster than gramicidin A and M2 channels, respectively, with high rejection of water and exceptionally high selectivity factors of 167.6, 122.7 and 81.5 over Cl&#8208;, Na+, and K+ ions. We propose here a novel proton transport mechanism where a proton may create its own channel spanning water chain from two or more short water chains to facilitate its own transmembrane flux.</dc:description>

         <title>Syntheses of Covalent Organic Frameworks via a One&#8208;Pot Suzuki Coupling and Schiff&#8217;s Base Reaction  for C2H4/C3H6 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) featuring permanent porosity, designable topologies, and tailorable functionalities have attracted great interest in the past two decades. Developing efficient modular approaches to rationally constructing COFs from a set of molecules via covalent linking has been long pursued. Herein, we reported a facile one&#8208;pot strategy to prepare COFs via an irreversible Suzuki coupling reaction followed by a reversible Schiff&#8217;s base reaction without the need for intermediate isolation. Gram&#8208;scale ordered frameworks with  kgm  topology and rich porosities can be obtained by using diamino&#8208;aryl halide and dialdehyde aryl&#8208;borate compounds as monomers. The resultant microporous CR&#8208;COFs were used for efficient C  2  H  4  /C  3  H  6  separation. This strategy reduces the waste generated and efforts consumed by stepwise reactions and relative purification processes, making the large&#8208;scale syntheses of stable COFs feasible. Moreover, it offers a novel modular approach to designing COF materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyoxometalate Surfactant Assemblies: Responsiveness to Orthogonal Stimuli</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Integrating different types of supramolecular interactions opens the possibility to generate nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs) at the liquid&#8208;liquid interface that are responsive to multiple stimuli. Here we develop a covalently modified polyoxometalate/&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (POM/&#946;&#8208;CD) organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid, consisting of a negatively charged POM cluster with &#946;&#8208;CD host groups. The POM/&#946;&#8208;CD hybrid can be dispersed in water and interact at a water/oil interface with ligands dissolved in an oil phase through electrostatic or host&#8208;guest interactions, thereby generating POM&#8208;surfactants (POMSs) having pH, redox, and guest&#8208;competitive responsiveness, respectively. By taking advantage of the jamming of POMSs at the interface, a reconfigurable all&#8208;liquid system could be produced that is responsive to orthogonal changes in the external environment.</dc:description>

         <title>A Hybrid Supramolecular Polymeric Nanomedicine for Cascade&#8208;Amplified Synergetic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular nanomedicines have shown unparalleled merits in cancer therapy, but their clinical translation is greatly hampered by monotonous therapeutic modality and unsatisfactory antitumor performance. Herein, a hybrid supramolecular polymeric nanomedicine (SNPs) is developed based on &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin/camptothecin (CPT) host&#8722;guest molecular recognition and iron&#8208;carboxylate coordination. Iron ions stabilizing SNPs catalyze the conversion of intracellular hydrogen peroxide into highly toxic hydroxyl radical through a Fenton reaction, which further cleaves thioketal linker of the supramolecular monomer to release potent CPT, thus synergistically amplifying the therapeutic efficacy by combining chemodynamic therapy and chemotherapy. The combination therapy stimulates antitumor immunity and promotes intratumoral infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes by triggering immunogenic cell death. In synergy with PD&#8208;L1 checkpoint blockade, SNPs enables enhanced immune therapy and a long&#8208;term tumor remission.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aluminum&#8722;sulfur (Al&#8722;S) batteries of ultrahigh energy&#8208;to&#8208;price ratios are promising energy storage technology, while they suffer from large voltage gap and short lifespan. Herein, we propose an electrocatalyst&#8208;boosting quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Al&#8722;S battery, which involves sulfur&#8208;anchored cobalt/nitrogen co&#8208;doped graphene (S@CoNG) positive electrode and ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;impregnated metal organic framework (IL@MOF) electrolyte. The Co&#8722;N4 sites in CoNG continuously catalyze the breaking of Al&#8722;Cl and S&#8722;S bonds and accelerate the sulfur conversion, endowing the Al&#8722;S battery with a shortened voltage gap of 0.43 V and a high discharge voltage plateau of 0.9 V. In the quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state IL@MOF electrolytes, shuttle effect of polysulfides has been inhibited, which stabilizes reversible sulfur reaction, enabling Al&#8722;S battery to deliver 820 mAh g&#8211;1 specific capacity and 78% capacity retention after 300 cycles. This finding offers novel insights to design Al&#8722;S battery for stable energy storage.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inferior contact interface and low charge transfer efficiency seriously restrict the performance of heterojunction. Herein, chemically bonded &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3/Bi4MO8Cl (M=Nb, Ta) dot&#8208;on&#8208;plate Z&#8208;scheme junctions with strong internal electric field are crafted by in situ growth route. Experimental and theoretical results co&#8208;unravel that internal electric field provides a powerful driving force for vectorial migration of photocharges between Bi4MO8Cl and &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3, and interfacial Fe&#8208;O bond not only serves as atomic&#8208;level charge flow highway but also lowers charge transfer energy barrier, thereby accelerating Z&#8208;scheme charge transfer and realizing effective spatial charge separation.

         <title>Robust Self&#8208;Assembled Molecular Passivation for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Defect passivation via post&#8208;treatment of perovskite films is an effective method to fabricate high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the passivation durability is still an issue due to the weak and vulnerable bonding between passivating functional groups and perovskite defect sites. Here we propose a cholesterol derivative self&#8208;assembly strategy to construct crosslinked and compact membranes throughout perovskite films. These supramolecular membranes act as a robust protection layer against harsh operational conditions while providing effective passivation of defects from surface toward inner grain boundaries. The resultant PSCs exhibit a power conversion efficiency of 23.34% with an impressive open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.164 eV. The unencapsulated devices retain 92% of their initial efficiencies after 1600 h of storage under ambient conditions, and remain almost unchanged after heating at 85  o  C for 500 h in a nitrogen atmosphere, showing significantly improved stability.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A 2&#8208;biphenylacetylene was fixed into a specific conformation within the confined cavity of a hollow cage, where it underwent a regioselective spirocyclization in the presence of an electrophile. A 5&#8208;  endo  &#8208;  dig  cyclization proceeded selectively in the cage, which stands in sharp contrast to the 6&#8208;  endo  &#8208;  dig  cyclization that normally occurs in common organic media. The folded conformation adopted by the substrate within the cage was examined by  1  H NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoelectrochemical Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia on Ordered Silicon Nanowire Array Photocathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a new path to &#8216;green&#8217; ammonia production, photoelectrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (PEC NO3RR) is investigated for the first time. An Au&#8208;decorated ordered silicon nanowire (O_SiNW) array photocathode demonstrates 95.6% of Faradaic efficiency (FE) to ammonia at 0.2 VRHE, which represents a more positive potential than the thermodynamic reduction potential of nitrate by utilizing photovoltage. The high FE is possible because both Si and Au surfaces are inactive for competing water reduction to hydrogen. The O_SiNW array structure is favorable to promote the PEC NO3RR relative to planar Si or randomly&#8208;grown Si nanowire, by enabling the uniform distribution of small Au nanoparticles as an electrocatalyst and facilitating the mass transport during the reaction. The results demonstrate the feasibility of PEC nitrate conversion to ammonia and would motivate further studies and developments.</dc:description>

         <title>Realizing Fast Synthesis of High&#8208;Silica Zeolite Y with Remarkable Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy was developed to realize fast crystallization of the high&#8208;silica zeolite&#8197;Y, and the key factors affecting crystallization kinetics and phase purity were elucidated. The high&#8208;silica products possess high (hydro)thermal stability and abundant strong acid sites, which endow them with excellent catalytic cracking performance.







Abstract
High&#8208;silica zeolite Y (FAU) plays a vital role in (petro)chemical industries. However, the slow nucleation and growth kinetics of the high&#8208;silica FAU framework limit its direct synthesis and the improvement of framework SiO2/Al2O3 ratio (SAR). Here, a facile strategy is developed to realize the fast crystallization of high&#8208;silica zeolite Y, which involves the combination of high crystallization temperature, ultra&#8208;stable Y (USY) seeds and efficient organic&#8208;structure directing agent (OSDA). The synthesis can be finished in 5&#8211;16&#8197;h at 160&#8201;&#176;C and with tunable SAR up to 18.2, and the key factors affecting crystallization kinetics and phase purity are elucidated. Moreover, the crystallization process was monitored to reveal the fast crystal growth mechanism. The high&#8208;silica products possess high (hydro)thermal stability and abundant strong acid sites, which endow them excellent catalytic cracking performance, obviously superior to commercial USY.

         <title>Oligomeric Acceptor: A &#8220;Two&#8208;in&#8208;One&#8221; Strategy to Bridge Small Molecules and Polymers for Stable Solar Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three oligomeric acceptors were synthesized in this work. Investigations revealed that oligomer acceptor&#8208;based devices showed much better photovoltaic performance and light&#8208;soaking stability than small molecules and polymers. dBTIC&#947;&#8208;EH, a dimer, showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.06&#8201;% in Q&#8208;PHJ devices with superior device stability, which is the highest value among the reported oligomeric acceptors to date.







Abstract
Oligomeric acceptors are expected to combine the advantages of both highly developed small molecular and polymeric acceptors. However, organic solar cells (OSCs) based on oligomers lag far behind due to their slow development and low diversity. Here, three oligomeric acceptors were produced through oligomerization of small molecules. The dimer dBTIC&#947;&#8208;EH achieved the best power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 14.48&#8201;% in bulk heterojunction devices and possessed a T80 (80&#8201;% of the initial PCE) lifetime of 1020&#8197;h under illumination, which were far better than that of small molecular and polymeric acceptors. More excitingly, it showed PCEs of 16.06&#8201;% in quasi&#8208;planar heterojunction (Q&#8208;PHJ) devices which is the highest value OSCs using oligomeric acceptors to date. These results suggest that oligomerization of small molecules is a promising strategy to achieve OSCs with optimized performance between the high efficiency and durable stability, and offer oligomeric materials a bright future in commercial applications.

         <title>Achieving 37.1% Green Electroluminescent Efficiency and 0.09 eV Full Width at Half Maximum Based on a Ternary Boron&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Nitrogen Embedded Polycyclic Aromatic System</title>

         <dc:description>
A ternary B&#8722;O&#8722;N embedded multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitter is developed based on the para B&#8208;&#960;&#8208;B and O&#8208;&#960;&#8208;O strategy. It exhibits a narrowband green emission with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 19&#8197;nm/0.09&#8197;eV and a preferential horizontal dipole ratio of 96&#8201;%. The corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) emits green light with a FWHM of 27&#8197;nm and a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 37.1&#8201;%.







Abstract
Herein, a ternary boron&#8208;oxygen&#8208;nitrogen embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF), namely DBNO, is developed by adopting the para boron&#8208;&#960;&#8208;boron and para oxygen&#8208;&#960;&#8208;oxygen strategy. The designed molecule presents a vivid green emission with a high photoluminescence quantum yield (96&#8201;%) and an extremely narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 19&#8197;nm/0.09&#8197;eV, which surpasses all previously reported green TADF emitters to date. In addition, the long molecular structure along the transition dipole moment direction endows it with a high horizontal emitting dipole ratio of 96&#8201;%. The organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) based on DBNO reveals a narrowband green emission with a peak at 504&#8197;nm and a FWHM of 24&#8197;nm/0.12&#8197;eV. Particularly, a significantly improved device performance is achieved by the TADF&#8208;sensitization (hyperfluorescence) mechanism, presenting a FWHM of 27&#8197;nm and a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 37.1&#8201;%.

         <title>Controllable Disulfide Exchange Polymerization of Polyguanidine for Effective Biomedical Applications by Thiol&#8208;Mediated Uptake</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of bioreducible polyguanidines (mPEG225&#8208;b&#8208;PSSn) was obtained by a controllable and efficient disulfide exchange polymerization by controlling the polarity of the polymerization solvent to regulate the concentration of the activated nucleophile. This approach provides an attractive and controllable strategy for the construction of bioactive substance delivery systems for effective biomedical applications.







Abstract
New preparation methods of vectors are the key to developing the next generation of biomacromolecule delivery systems. In this study, a controllable disulfide exchange polymerization was established to obtain low&#8208;toxicity and efficient bioreducible polyguanidines (mPEG225&#8208;b&#8208;PSSn, n=13, 26, 39, 75, 105) by regulating the concentration of activated nucleophiles and reaction time under mild reaction conditions. The relationship between the degrees of polymerization and biocompatibility was studied to identify the optimal polyguanidine mPEG225&#8208;b&#8208;PSS26. Such polyguanidine exhibited good in vitro performance in delivering different functional nucleic acids. The impressive therapeutic effects of mPEG225&#8208;b&#8208;PSS26 were further verified in the 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mice as well as the mice with full&#8208;thickness skin defects. Controllable disulfide exchange polymerization provides an attractive strategy for the construction of new biomacromolecule delivery systems.

&lt;p&gt;A series of bioreducible polyguanidines (mPEG&lt;sub&gt;225&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-PSS&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;) was obtained by a controllable and efficient disulfide exchange polymerization by controlling the polarity of the polymerization solvent to regulate the concentration of the activated nucleophile. This approach provides an attractive and controllable strategy for the construction of bioactive substance delivery systems for effective biomedical applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New preparation methods of vectors are the key to developing the next generation of biomacromolecule delivery systems. In this study, a controllable disulfide exchange polymerization was established to obtain low-toxicity and efficient bioreducible polyguanidines (mPEG&lt;sub&gt;225&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-PSS&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=13, 26, 39, 75, 105) by regulating the concentration of activated nucleophiles and reaction time under mild reaction conditions. The relationship between the degrees of polymerization and biocompatibility was studied to identify the optimal polyguanidine mPEG&lt;sub&gt;225&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-PSS&lt;sub&gt;26&lt;/sub&gt;. Such polyguanidine exhibited good in vitro performance in delivering different functional nucleic acids. The impressive therapeutic effects of mPEG&lt;sub&gt;225&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-PSS&lt;sub&gt;26&lt;/sub&gt; were further verified in the 4T1 tumor-bearing mice as well as the mice with full-thickness skin defects. Controllable disulfide exchange polymerization provides an attractive strategy for the construction of new biomacromolecule delivery systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Axially chiral styrene&#8208;carboxylic esters and C2 symmetric stilbene&#8208;dicarboxylic esters were synthesized in high yields with excellent enantioselectivity by the cationic rhodium(I)/H8&#8208;binap complex&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions. The rhodium&#8208;catalyzed and chelation&#8208;controlled enantioselection mechanism was elucidated by DFT calculations.







Abstract
Axially chiral styrene&#8208;carboxylic esters were synthesized in high yields with excellent enantioselectivity by the cationic rhodium(I)/H8&#8208;BINAP complex&#8208;catalyzed chelation&#8208;controlled [2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions of 1,6&#8208; and 1,7&#8208;diynes with 1,3&#8208;enyne&#8208;carboxylic esters. The diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of C2 symmetric axially chiral cis and trans&#8208;stilbene&#8208;dicarboxylic esters was also achieved by the double [2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions of two molecules of the 1,6&#8208;diyne with 2,3&#8208;dialkynylmaleate and 2,3&#8208;dialkynylfumarate, respectively. In these reactions, the 1,3&#8208;enyne&#8208;carboxylic esters coordinating to rhodium with a five&#8208;membered chelate were more reactive than those coordinating to rhodium with a six&#8208;membered chelate, although both chelation modes realized excellent enantioselectivity. The enantioselection mechanism of the cationic rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed chelation&#8208;controlled [2+2+2] cycloaddition was elucidated by DFT calculations.

         <title>Self&#8208;Reporting Activated Ester&#8208;Amine Reaction for Enantioselective Multi&#8208;Channel Visual Detection of Chiral Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented self&#8208;reporting activated ester&#8208;amine reaction, which relies on the cis&#8208;transoid to cis&#8208;cisoid helical transition of a polyphenylacetylene backbone, triggers fluorescence. Owing to the high sensitivity and selectivity, this self&#8208;reporting process can provide multi&#8208;channel visual detection of structurally diverse achiral and chiral amines.







Abstract
Chiral recognition is of importance not only in living systems but also in estimating the optical purity of enantiomeric drugs and fabricating advanced materials. Herein we report a novel self&#8208;reporting activated ester&#8208;amine reaction that can provide multi&#8208;channel visual detection of organic amines. It relies on the reaction extent dependent cis&#8208;transoid to cis&#8208;cisoid helical transition of the polyphenylacetylene backbone and the thus triggered fluorescence. Owing to the high selectivity, this visual process can recognize structurally diverse achiral amines and quantitatively check the impurity content. It also shows an outstanding enantioselectivity towards various chiral amines and can be applied to determine enantiomeric composition. The multiple responses in absorption, circular dichroism, photoluminescence, and circularly polarized luminescence make the helical transition of the polymer backbone a potential detection mode for high&#8208;throughput screening of chiral chemicals.

         <title>Beyond a Linker: The Role of Photochemistry of Crosslinkers in the Direct Optical Patterning of Colloidal Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrene&#8208; and carbene&#8208;based photocrosslinkers enable direct optical patterning of colloidal nanocrystals via similar mechanism. However, their photochemistry drastically affects the patterning capabilities and photophysical properties of patterned nanocrystals. Understanding their roles beyond physical linkers guides the rational design of crosslinkers for high&#8208;performance patterned NC layers and devices, such as electroluminescent QLEDs.







Abstract
Surface chemistry mediated direct optical patterning represents an emerging strategy for incorporating colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) in integrated optoelectronic platforms including displays and image sensors. However, the role of photochemistry of crosslinkers and other photoactive species in patterning remains elusive. Here we show the design of nitrene&#8208; and carbene&#8208;based photocrosslinkers can strongly affect the patterning capabilities and photophysical properties of NCs, especially quantum dots (QDs). Their role beyond physical linkers stems from structure&#8208;dictated electronic configuration, energy alignment and associated reaction kinetics and thermodynamics. Patterned QD layers with designed carbene&#8208;based crosslinkers fully preserve their photoluminescent and electroluminescent properties. Patterned light emitting diodes (QLEDs) show a maximum external quantum efficiency of &#8776;12&#8201;% and lifetime over 4800&#8197;h, among the highest for reported patterned QLEDs. These results would guide the rational design of photoactive species in NC patterning and create new possibilities in the monolithic integration of NCs in high&#8208;performance device platforms.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Reliable Low&#8208;Dimensional Perovskites Passivated Black&#8208;Phase CsPbI3 toward Stable and Efficient Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Temperature&#8208;reliable low&#8208;dimensional (LD) perovskites (1D PTAPbI3 and 2D PTA2PbI4) are demonstrated to form in situ at grain boundaries and surfaces of CsPbI3 perovskite. As&#8208;formed LD perovskites can effectively passivate the defects in CsPbI3 films and prevent moisture intrusion as well. This PTAI&#8208;based LD&#8208;decorated CsPbI3 perovskite solar cell exhibits a record efficiency of 21.0&#8201;% with enhanced stabilities.







Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional (LD) perovskites can effectively passivate and stabilize 3D perovskites for high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Regards CsPbI3&#8208;based PSCs, the influence of high&#8208;temperature annealing on the LD perovskite passivation effect has to be taken into account due to fact the black&#8208;phase CsPbI3 crystallization requires high&#8208;temperature treatment, however, which has been rarely concerned so far. Here, the thermal stability of LD perovskites based on three hydrophobic organic ammonium salts and their passivation effect toward CsPbI3 and the whole device performance, have been investigated. It is found that, phenyltrimethylammonium iodide (PTAI) and its corresponding LD perovskites exhibit excellent thermal stability. Further investigation reveals that PTAI&#8208;based LD perovskites are mainly distributed at grain boundaries, which not only enhances the phase stability of CsPbI3 but also effectively suppresses non&#8208;radiative recombination. As a consequence, the champion PSC device based on CsPbI3 exhibits a record efficiency of 21.0&#8201;% with high stability.

         <title>Circularly Polarized White Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Spiro&#8208;Type Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes that can harvest both singlet and triplet excitons have been developed by combining two pairs of spiro&#8208;type circularly polarized delayed fluorescence enantiomers with complementary emissions as chiral emissive layers. Remarkable device performances are observed, with an external quantum efficiency of up to 21.6&#8201;% and intense circularly polarized luminescence having a |gEL| factor of 3.0&#215;10&#8722;3.







Abstract
In this study, we report the first circularly polarized white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;WOLEDs) based on all thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials. Two pairs of spiro&#8208;type TADF enantiomers, (R/S)&#8208;SPOCN (5,5&#8242;&#8208;((2,2&#8242;,3,3&#8242;&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;spirobi[indene]&#8208;7,7&#8242;&#8208;diyl)bis(oxy))bis(4&#8208;(10H&#8208;phenoxazin&#8208;10&#8208;yl)phthalonitrile)) and (R/S)&#8208;OSFSO (2&#8242;&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;spiro[quinolino[3,2,1&#8208;kl]phenoxazine&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;thioxanthene]&#8208;10&#8242;,10&#8242;&#8208;dioxide), serve as emitters with complementary emission. The CP&#8208;OLEDs exhibit warm white emission with a CIE coordinate of (0.35, 0.46). Besides, decent device performances are observed with an external quantum efficiency of up to 21.6&#8201;% at maximum and 11.8&#8201;% at 1000 cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. Obvious circularly polarized electroluminescence signals are detected with a dissymmetry factor |gEL| of around 3.0&#215;10&#8722;3. This is the first report of CP&#8208;WOLEDs that can harvest both singlet and triplet excitons, which provides a feasible strategy for the development of CP&#8208;WOLEDs with remarkable device performances.

         <title>Benzo&#8208;Extended Cyclohepta[def]fluorene Derivatives with Very Low&#8208;Lying Triplet States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three open&#8208;shell non&#8208;alternant polycyclic hydrocarbons (PHs) based on the skeleton of cyclohepta[def]fluorene are synthesized via an efficient benzannulation stabilization strategy. The obtained persistent singlet diradcialoids have a narrow optical energy gap (0.52&#8211;0.69&#8197;eV). Moreover, variable&#8208;temperature EPR measurements indicate that all of them have a low&#8208;lying triplet state with an extremely small singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap.







Abstract
Open&#8208;shell non&#8208;alternant polycyclic hydrocarbons (PHs) are attracting increasing attention due to their promising applications in organic spintronics and quantum computing. Herein we report the synthesis of three cyclohepta[def]fluorene&#8208;based diradicaloids (1&#8211;3), by fusion of benzo rings on its periphery for the thermodynamic stabilization, as evidenced by multiple characterization techniques. Remarkably, all of them display a very narrow optical energy gap (Egopt=0.52&#8211;0.69&#8197;eV) and persistent stability under ambient conditions (t1/2=11.7&#8211;33.3&#8197;h). More importantly, this new type of diradicaloids possess a low&#8208;lying triplet state with an extremely small singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap, as low as 0.002&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, with a clear dependence on the molecular size. This family of compounds thus offers a new route to create non&#8208;alternant open&#8208;shell PHs with high&#8208;spin ground states, and opens up novel possibilities and insights into understanding the structure&#8211;property relationships.

         <title>Amplified Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence Behavior Triggered by Helical Nanofibers from Chiral Co&#8208;assembly Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chirality and chiral induction ability of chiral binaphthyl&#8208;based polymers can be regulated by changing the dihedral angle of chiral bi&#8208;naphthyl moiety. The obtained circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) based on the emitting layer (EML) of chiral co&#8208;assembly (R/S&#8208;P2)0.6&#8208;(NPy)0.4 exhibit a high CP&#8208;EL (electroluminescence) signal (|gEL|=4.8&#215;10&#8722;2) and an excellent device performance.







Abstract
Two chiral binaphthyl polymers (R/S&#8208;P1 and R/S&#8208;P2) with different dihedral angles of the binaphthyl moiety were chosen as chiral inducers to construct chiral co&#8208;assemblies with an achiral pyrene&#8208;naphthalimide dye (NPy) and then acted as the emitting layer (EML) of circularly polarized electroluminescence (CP&#8208;EL) devices. The anchored dihedral angle of R/S&#8208;P2 not only exhibited the enhanced chirality signal, but also had a strong chirality&#8208;inducing effect on the achiral NPy dye in the chiral co&#8208;assembly (R/S&#8208;P2)0.6&#8208;(NPy)0.4. After annealing at 120&#8201;&#176;C, the CPL signal (|gem|) of ordered helical nano&#8208;fibers (R/S&#8208;P2)0.6&#8208;(NPy)0.4 was amplified to 5.6&#215;10&#8722;2, which was about 6&#8208;fold larger than that of (R/S&#8208;P1)0.6&#8208;(NPy)0.4. The amplified gem value of (R/S&#8208;P2)0.6&#8208;(NPy)0.4 was due to the formation of a helical co&#8208;assembly through the strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interaction between the R/S&#8208;P2 and the achiral NPy. This kind of ordered helical nano&#8208;fibers (R/S&#8208;P2)0.6&#8208;(NPy)0.4 acted as the EML of CP&#8208;OLEDs, and achieved an excellent CP&#8208;EL performance (|gEL|=4.8&#215;10&#8722;2).

         <title>Operando Spectroscopy Unveils the Catalytic Role of Different Palladium Oxidation States in CO Oxidation on Pd/CeO2 Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Establishing structure&#8211;activity relationships for practical catalysts requires a multi&#8208;technique operando approach. Using advanced spectroscopic tools and kinetic methods the catalytic role of different Pd oxidation states in CO oxidation was unveiled for Pd/CeO2 catalysts. Single&#8208;atom Pd&#8211;oxo species and Pd&#8722;O&#8722;Ce interface are responsible for low&#8208;temperature activity, whereas metallic Pd sites significantly contribute only at elevated temperature.







Abstract
Aiming at knowledge&#8208;driven design of novel metal&#8211;ceria catalysts for automotive exhaust abatement, current efforts mostly pertain to the synthesis and understanding of well&#8208;defined systems. In contrast, technical catalysts are often heterogeneous in their metal speciation. Here, we unveiled rich structural dynamics of a conventional impregnated Pd/CeO2 catalyst during CO oxidation.

     alt="Operando Spectroscopy Unveils the Catalytic Role of Different Palladium Oxidation States in CO Oxidation on Pd/CeO2 Catalysts"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Establishing structure&#8211;activity relationships for practical catalysts requires a multi-technique operando approach. Using advanced spectroscopic tools and kinetic methods the catalytic role of different Pd oxidation states in CO oxidation was unveiled for Pd/CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalysts. Single-atom Pd&#8211;oxo species and Pd&#8722;O&#8722;Ce interface are responsible for low-temperature activity, whereas metallic Pd sites significantly contribute only at elevated temperature.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aiming at knowledge-driven design of novel metal&#8211;ceria catalysts for automotive exhaust abatement, current efforts mostly pertain to the synthesis and understanding of well-defined systems. In contrast, technical catalysts are often heterogeneous in their metal speciation. Here, we unveiled rich structural dynamics of a conventional impregnated Pd/CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst during CO oxidation. In situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed the presence of metallic and oxidic Pd states during the reaction. Using transient operando infrared spectroscopy, we probed the nature and reactivity of the surface intermediates involved in CO oxidation. We found that while low-temperature activity is associated with sub-oxidized and interfacial Pd sites, the reaction at elevated temperatures involves metallic Pd. These results highlight the utility of the multi-technique operando approach for establishing structure&#8211;activity relationships of technical catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclic Allylborates from 1,3&#8208;Dienes and a Diboron Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of cyclic allylborates was achieved by the reaction of 1,3&#8208;dienes and B2pin2 using a copper catalyst. The cyclic allylborate could be used in several organic transformations such as regioselective protonation, the allylation of electrophiles, and Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling.







Abstract
The synthesis of cyclic allylborates was achieved by the reaction of 1,3&#8208;dienes and B2pin2 using a copper catalyst. Several 1,3&#8208;dienes were converted to the corresponding cyclic allylborates in moderate to high yields. The cyclic allylborate obtained could be used in several organic transformations such as allylation of electrophiles and Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling.

         <title>Efficient and Color&#8208;Tunable Dual&#8208;Mode Afterglow from Large&#8208;Area and Flexible Polymer&#8208;Based Transparent Films for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting and Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two indolocarbazole derivatives IaCzA and IbCzA have been synthesized and doped into poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) matrices. It is found that the resulting films simultaneously produce persistent thermally activated delayed fluorescence and ultralong organic phosphorescence, and their afterglow colors can be linearly tuned by temperature. Besides, the IbCzA&#8208;doped PVA film presents state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art dual&#8208;mode organic afterglow performance.







Abstract
It remains a great challenge to develop polymer&#8208;based materials with efficient and color&#8208;tunable organic afterglow. Two indolocarbazole derivatives IaCzA and IbCzA have been synthesized and doped into poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) matrices. It is found that the resulting films can produce unique dual&#8208;mode afterglow, which is composed of persistent thermally activated delayed fluorescence and ultralong organic phosphorescence. Besides, the IbCzA&#8208;doped PVA film exhibits intense blue afterglow with &#934;afterglow and &#964;afterglow up to 19.8&#8201;% and 1.81&#8197;s, respectively, representing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art dual&#8208;mode organic afterglow performance. Moreover, our reported film has high flexibility, excellent transparency, and large&#8208;area producibility; and the afterglow color of the film can be linearly tuned by temperature. Inspired by these distinctive properties, the PVA doped with IbCzA was employed as temperature&#8208;sensitive security ink for anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption.

         <title>A Rare Flexible Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Based on a Tailorable Mn8&#8208;Cluster Showing Smart Responsiveness to Aromatic Guests and Capacity for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extra degree of freedom to framework flexibility contributed by size&#8208; and shape&#8208;tailorable metal clusters is established, leading to three&#8208;dimensional variations of the framework that are smartly responsive to varied aromatic molecules.







Abstract
The design and creation of soft porous crystals combining regularity and flexibility may promote potential applications for gas storage and separation due to their deformable framework's responsiveness to external stimuli. The flexibility of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) relies on alterable degrees of freedom that are mainly provided by organic linkers or the junctions linking organic and inorganic building units. Herein, we report a new dynamic MOF whose flexibility originates from an unprecedented tailorable Mn8O38&#8208;cluster and shows simultaneous coordination geometry changes and ligand migration that are reversibly driven by guest exchange. This provides an extra degree of freedom to the framework's deformation, resulting in three&#8208;dimensional variations in the framework that subtly respond to varied aromatic molecules. The gas adsorption behavior of this flexible MOF was evaluated, and the selective separation of light hydrocarbons and Freon gases is achieved.

The first metal&#8208;, strain&#8208; and photo trigger&#8208;free, anionic cycloaddend&#8208;promoted bioorthogonal cycloaddition reaction between phenanthrene&#8208;9,10&#8208;dione and furan&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;one derivatives was reported. Mutually orthogonal labelling of different proteins and cells were realized using three bioorthogonal reactions including o&#8208;dione and furan&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;one cycloaddition (DFC), strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8211;alkyne click reaction (SPAAC) and inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction (IEDDA).







Abstract
The development of new bioorthogonal reactions with mutual orthogonality to classic bioorthogonal reactions such as the strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8211;alkyne click reaction and the inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction is of great importance in providing chemical tools for multiplex labelling of live cells. Here we report the first anionic cycloaddend&#8208;promoted bioorthogonal cycloaddition reaction between phenanthrene&#8208;9,10&#8208;dione and furan&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;one derivatives, where the high polarity of water is exploited to stabilize the highly electron&#8208;rich anionic cycloaddend. The reaction is metal&#8208; and strain&#8208;free, which proceeds rapidly in aqueous solution and on live cells with a second&#8208;order rate constant up to 119&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. The combined utilization of this reaction together with the two other widely used bioorthogonal reactions allows for mutually orthogonal labelling of three types of proteins or three groups of living cells in one batch without cross&#8208;talking. Such results highlight the great potential for multiplex labelling of different biomolecules in live cells.

         <title>Direct and Simultaneous Identification of Multiple Mitochondrial Reactive Oxygen Species in Living Cells Using a SERS Borrowing Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Identification of different mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) simultaneously in living cells is vital for understanding the critical roles of different ROS in biological processes. To date, it remains a great challenge to develop ROS probes for direct and simultaneous identification of multiple ROS with high specificity. Herein, we report a SERS&#8208;borrowing&#8208;strategy&#8208;based nanoprobe (Au@Pt core&#8208;shell nanoparticles) for simultaneous and direct identification of different ROS by their distinct Raman fingerprints. Isotope substitution experiments and DFT calculations confirmed the ability of Au@Pt nanoprobe to capture and identify different mitochondrial ROS (i.e. &#8226;OOH, H2O2, and &#8226;OH). When functionalized with triphenylphosphine (TPP), the Au@Pt&#8208;TPP nanoprobe located to mitochondria and detected multiple ROS simultaneously in living cells under oxidative stimulation. Our method offers a new tool for the study of the functions of various ROS in biological processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Starfish Cyclic Steroid Glycosides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Starfishes have evolved with a special type of secondary metabolites, namely starfish saponins, to ward off various predators and parasites; among them, the starfish cyclic steroid glycosides stand out structurally, featuring a unique 16&#8208;membered ring formed by bridging the steroidal C3 and C6 with a trisaccharide. The rigid cyclic scaffold and the congested and vulnerable steroid&#8208;sugar etherate linkage present an unprecedented synthetic challenge. Here we report a collective total synthesis of the major starfish cyclic steroid glycosides, namely luzonicosides A (  1  ) and D (  2  ) and sepositoside A (  3  ), with an innovative approach, which entails a  de novo  construction of the ether&#8208;linked hexopyranosyl units, use of olefinic pyranoses as sugar precursors, and a decisive ring&#8208;closing glycosylation under the mild gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferroelectric Polymer Drives Performance Enhancement of Non&#8208;fullerene Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enhancing the built&#8208;in electric field to promote charge dynamitic process is of great significance to boost the performance of the non&#8208;fullerene OSCs, which has rarely been concerned. In this work, we introduced a cheap ferroelectric polymer as an additive into the active layers of non&#8208;fullerene OSCs to improve the device performance. An additional and permanent electrical field was produced by the polarization of the ferroelectric dipoles, which can substantially enhance the built&#8208;in electric field. The promoted exciton separation, significantly accelerated charge transport, reduced the charge recombination, as well as the optimized film morphology were observed in the device, leading to a significantly improved performance of the PVDF&#8208;modified OSCs with various active layers, such as PM6:Y6, PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9, PM6:IT4F and PTB7&#8208;Th:Y6. Especially, a record efficiency of 17.72% for PM6:Y6&#8208;based OSC and an outstanding efficiency of 18.17% for PM6: BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;based OSC were achieved.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a key energy conversion process, which is critical for the efficient operation of fuel cells and metal air batteries. Here, we report the significant enhancement of the ORR&#8208;performance of commercial platinum&#8208;on&#8208;carbon electrocatalysts when operated in aqueous electrolyte solutions (pH 5.6), containing the polyoxoanion [Fe28(&#956;3&#8208;O)8(L&#8208;(&#8208;)&#8208;tart)16(CH3COO)24]20&#8208;. Mechanistic studies provide initial insights into the performance&#8208;improving role of the iron oxide cluster during ORR. Technological deployment of the system is demonstrated by incorporation into a direct formate microfluidic fuel cell (DFMFC), where major performance increases are observed when compared with reference electrolytes. The study provides the first examples of iron oxide clusters in electrochemical energy conversion and storage.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the discovery of the first two examples of cationic palladium(II)&#8208;oxo clusters (POCs) containing  f  &#8208;metal ions, [Pd  II  6  O  12  M  8  {(CH  3  )  2  AsO  2  }  16  (H  2  O)  8  ]  4+  (M = Ce  IV  , Th  IV  ), and their physicochemical characterization in the solid state, in solution and in the gas phase. The molecular structure of the two novel POCs comprises an octahedral {Pd  6  O  12  }  12  &#8210;  core that is capped by eight M  IV  ions resulting in a cationic, cubic assembly {Pd  6  O  12  M  IV  8  }  20+  , which is coordinated by a total of 16 terminal dimethylarsinate and eight water ligands, resulting in the tetra&#8208;cationic, mixed Pd  II  &#8208;Ce  IV  /Th  IV  oxo&#8208;clusters [Pd  II  6  O  12  M  8  {(CH  3  )  2  AsO  2  }  16  (H  2  O)  8  ]  4+  (M = Ce,  Pd  6  Ce  8  ; Th,  Pd  6  Th  8  ).

         <title>Concentrated Aqueous Peroxodicarbonate: Efficient Electrosynthesis and Use as Oxidizer in Epoxidations, S&#8208;, and N&#8208;Oxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peroxodicarbonates are of substantial interest as potentially powerful and sustainable oxidizers, but have so far been accessible only in low concentrations with unsatisfactory energy efficiency. Concentrated (&gt;0.9 mol/L) peroxodicarbonate solutions have now been made accessible by the electrolysis of aqueous K2CO3  / Na2CO3  / KHCO3&#160;solutions at high current density of 3.33 A/cm2&#160;in an efficiently cooled circular flow reactor equipped with a boron&#8208;doped diamond anode and a stainless&#8208;steel cathode. Their synthetic potential as platform oxidizers was clearly demonstrated in transformations including sulfoxidation,  N  &#8208;oxidation, and epoxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Self&#8208;Assembly of Chloride&#8208; and Ion&#8208;Pair&#8208;Templated Cryptates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While supramolecular hosts capable of binding and transporting anions and ion pairs are now widely available, self&#8208;assembled architectures are still rare, even though they offer an inherent mechanism for the release of the guest ion(s). In this work, we report the dynamic covalent self&#8208;assembly of tripodal, urea&#8208;based anion cryptates that are held together by two orthoester bridgeheads. These hosts exhibit affinity for anions such as Cl  &#8208;  , Br  &#8208;  or I  &#8208;  in the moderate range that is typically advantageous for applications in membrane transport. In unprecedented experiments, we were able to dissociate the Cs&#8226;Cl ion pair by simultaneously assembling suitably sized orthoester hosts around the Cs  +  and the Cl  &#8208;  ion.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure of an Ultrathin Oxide on Pt3Sn(111) Solved by Machine Learning Enhanced Global Optimization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Determination of the atomic structure of solid surfaces typically depends on comparison of measured properties with simulations based on hypothesized structural models. For simple structures, the models may be guessed, but for more complex structures there is a need for reliable theory&#8208;based search algorithms. So far, such methods have been limited by the combinatorial complexity and computational expense of sufficiently accurate energy estimation for surfaces. However, the introduction of machine learning methods has the potential to change this radically. Here, we demonstrate how an evolutionary algorithm, utilizing machine learning for accelerated energy estimation and diverse population generation, can be used to solve an unknown surface structure&#8212;the (4&#215;4) surface oxide on Pt3Sn(111)&#8211;based on limited experimental input. The algorithm is efficient and robust, and should be broadly applicable in surface studies, where it can replace manual, intuition based model generation.</dc:description>

         <title>Long&#8208;lived Charge&#8208;Transfer State in Spiro Compact Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dyads Based on Pyromellitimide&#8208;Derived Rhodamine: Charge Transfer Dynamics and Electron Spin Polarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We observed a long&#8208;lived charge transfer (CT) state in a novel orthogonal compact electron donor&#8208;acceptor dyads, with closed form of rhodamine (Rho) as electron donor and pyromellitimide (PI) as electron acceptor (or thionated PI). The two parts in the dyads are connected via a spiro quaternary carbon atom, thus the torsion between the donor and acceptor is completely inhibited, which is beneficial to reduce the reorganization energy and to exploit the Marcus inverted region effect to prolong the CT state lifetime. Femtosecond transient absorption spectra show that the charge separation is rather fast, while nanosecond transient absorption spectra confirmed the formation of long&#8208;lived CT state (2.6 &#956;s). Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra determined the spin multiplicity of the long living state and assigned it to a 3CT state. Replace of an oxygen atom in PI part with sulfur atom favoring classical intersystem crossing processes, causes a consistently shortening of the lifetime of the 3CT state (0.29 &#956;s).</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrodeacetoxylation of Aryl Acetates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acetate serves as a renewable and easily installed leaving group for selective deoxygenation of phenolics (ArOH). Ni&#8208;catalyzed hydrodeacetoxylation of aryl acetates (Ar  &#8208;  OAc) with HBpin in a green carbonate solvent selectively delivers the corresponding deoxygenated arenes (ArH). The method is also applicable to highly challenging guaiacyl and syringyl acetates, leaving &#8208;OMe groups intact without arene reduction. Renewable 4&#8208;propylguaiacol obtained from pine can also be transformed without significant loss in yield versus oil derived feedstock. The observed chemoselectivity for Ar  &#8208;  OAc versus ArO  &#8208;  Ac bond cleavage was rationalized based on mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations. ArOH side&#8208;product formation is attributed to direct competitive Ni&#8208;catalyzed reduction of the C=O bond. Hydrodeacyloxylation of a set of aryl alkanoates featured interesting chemoselectivity with a dramatic influence of the length and structure of the alkyl chain on catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic overall water splitting under visible light enabled by a particulate conjugated polymer loaded with iridium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer photocatalysts have received growing attention in recent years for photocatalytic hydrogen production from water. Most studies report hydrogen production with sacrificial electron donors, which is unsuitable for large&#8208;scale hydrogen energy production. Here we show that the palladium/iridium oxide&#8208;loaded homopolymer of dibenzo[b,d]thiophene sulfone (P10) facilitates overall water splitting to produce stoichiometric amounts of H2 and O2 for an extended period (&gt;60 hours) after the system stabilized. These results demonstrate that conjugated polymers can act as single component photocatalytic systems for overall water splitting when loaded with suitable co&#8208;catalysts, albeit currently with low activities. Transient spectroscopy shows that the IrO2 co&#8208;catalyst plays an important role in the generation of the charge separated state required for water splitting, with evidence for fast hole transfer to the co&#8208;catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>An Artificial Light&#8208;Harvesting System with Controllable Efficiency Enabled by an Annulene&#8208;Based Anisotropic Fluid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An annulene&#8208;based discotic liquid crystal (LC) material to construct a tunable light&#8208;harvesting platform is developed. Relying on the thermal&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembling ability of the LC molecule with variable molecular order, the efficiency of the light&#8208;harvesting system can be controlled at different temperatures when Nile red is introduced as an acceptor. This system exhibits a high antenna effect (39.1) at a 100&#8201;:&#8201;1 donor/acceptor ratio.







Abstract
The development of controllable artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems based on liquid crystal (LC) materials, i.e., anisotropic fluids, remains a challenge. Herein, an annulene&#8208;based discotic LC compound 6 with a saddle&#8208;shaped cyclooctatetrathiophene core has been synthesized to construct a tunable light&#8208;harvesting platform. The LC material shows a typical aggregation&#8208;induced emission, which can act as a suitable light&#8208;harvesting donor. By loading Nile red (NiR) as an acceptor, an artificial light&#8208;harvesting system is achieved. Relying on the thermal&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembling ability of 6 with variable molecular order, the efficiency of such 6&#8208;NiR system can be controlled by temperature. This light&#8208;harvesting system works sensitively at a high donor/acceptor ratio as 1000&#8201;:&#8201;1, and exhibits a high antenna effect (39.1) at a 100&#8201;:&#8201;1 donor/acceptor ratio. This thermochromic artificial light&#8208;harvesting LC system could find potential applications in smart devices employing soft materials.

         <title>Biomimetic FeMo(Se, Te) as Joint Electron Pool Promoting Nitrogen Electrofixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogenase&#8208;inspired FeMo(Se, Te) catalysts have been theoretically predicted and experimentally synthesized. They exhibit remarkable structural features of joint electron pool for promoting N2 electrofixation.







Abstract
It has been long believed that the FeMoS structure, where Fe is bonded with S, plays a pivotal role as a biomimetic catalyst for electrochemical nitrogen (N2) fixation. Nevertheless, the structure of Fe bonded to heavier analogues (Se or Te) has never been explored for N2 electrofixation. Here, we theoretically predict the electronic structure of FeMo(Se, Te) composed of tri&#8208;coordinated Fe species with open shells for binding with Se, which forms a joint electron pool for promoting N2 activation. Guided by this interesting prediction, we then demonstrate a two&#8208;step procedure to synthesize such structures, which display remarkable N2 electrofixation activities with an ammonia yield of 72.54&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1 and a Faradic efficiency of 51.67&#8201;% that are more than three times of the FeMoS counterpart. Further mechanism studies have been conducted by density function theory (DFT) simulations. This work provides new clues for designing versatile electrocatalytic materials for large&#8208;scale industrialization.

         <title>Chemoselective Transamidation of Thioamides by Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free N&#8722;C(S) Transacylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first general, mild and highly chemoselective method for transamidation of thioamides by N&#8722;C(S) transacylation is reported. This process exploits the concept of site&#8208;selective N&#8208;tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl activation, resulting in ground&#8208;state&#8208;destabilization of thioamides. The study establishes a powerful direction to the development of new molecules in chemistry and biology by rational modification of nN&#8594;&#960;*C=S resonance of the thioamide bond.







Abstract
Thioamides represent highly valuable isosteric in the strictest sense &#8220;single&#8208;atom substitution&#8221; analogues of amides that have found broad applications in chemistry and biology. A long&#8208;standing challenge is the direct transamidation of thioamides, a process which would convert one thioamide bond (R&#8722;C(S)&#8722;NR1R2) into another (R&#8722;C(S)&#8722;NR3N4). Herein, we report the first general method for the direct transamidation of thioamides by highly chemoselective N&#8722;C(S) transacylation. The method relies on site&#8208;selective N&#8208;tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl activation of 2&#176; and 1&#176; thioamides, resulting in ground&#8208;state&#8208;destabilization of thioamides, thus enabling to rationally manipulate nucleophilic addition to the thioamide bond. This method showcases a remarkably broad scope including late&#8208;stage functionalization (&gt;100 examples). We further present extensive DFT studies that provide insight into the chemoselectivity and provide guidelines for the development of transamidation methods of the thioamide bond.

         <title>Multicolour Fluorescence Based on Excitation&#8208;Dependent Electron Transfer Processes in o&#8208;Carborane Dyads</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) approach to construct dual&#8208;fluorescence materials is presented. Impressively, the o&#8208;carborane dyads show multicolour fluorescence from single molecules due to the competition of nonradiative relaxation channels between internal conversion (IC) and PeT. Importantly, the multicolour, flexible and transparent films as well as an anticounterfeiting application using this dyad are well demonstrated.







Abstract
Organic materials with excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent (Ex&#8208;de) emission are highly attractive for anticounterfeiting, optoelectronics and bioassay applications; however, the realization of Ex&#8208;de fluorescence, independent of aggregation states, remains a challenge. We herein report a photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) strategy to design Ex&#8208;de fluorescence materials by manipulating the relaxation pathways of multiple excited states. As expected, the o&#8208;carborane dyad presents a clear Ex&#8208;de fluorescence colour in the aggregated states, resulting from the tunable relative intensity of the dual&#8208;fluorescence spectra. Taking TP[1]B as an example, the amorphous powders emitted bright blue&#8208;violet, white and yellow colours under 390&#8197;nm, 365&#8197;nm and 254&#8197;nm UV illumination, respectively. Importantly, multicolour, flexible and transparent films as well as an anticounterfeiting application using this o&#8208;carborane dyad are demonstrated.

         <title>Coloration in Supraparticles Assembled from Polyhedral Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Particles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supraparticles exhibiting coloration and high structural order are assembled from four different uniform, polyhedral metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) particles. In these supraparticles, the macroscopic color originates from constructive interference of light reflected at ordered surface layers of the polyhedral particles.







Abstract
Supraparticles are spherical colloidal crystals prepared by confined self&#8208;assembly processes. A particularly appealing property of these microscale structures is the structural color arising from interference of light with their building blocks. Here, we assemble supraparticles with high structural order that exhibit coloration from uniform, polyhedral metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) particles. We analyse the structural coloration as a function of the size of these anisotropic building blocks and their internal structure. We attribute the angle&#8208;dependent coloration of the MOF supraparticles to the presence of ordered, onion&#8208;like layers at the outermost regions. Surprisingly, even though different shapes of the MOF particles have different propensities to form these onion layers, all supraparticle dispersions show well&#8208;visible macroscopic coloration, indicating that local ordering is sufficient to generate interference effects.

&lt;p&gt;Supraparticles exhibiting coloration and high structural order are assembled from four different uniform, polyhedral metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) particles. In these supraparticles, the macroscopic color originates from constructive interference of light reflected at ordered surface layers of the polyhedral particles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supraparticles are spherical colloidal crystals prepared by confined self-assembly processes. A particularly appealing property of these microscale structures is the structural color arising from interference of light with their building blocks. Here, we assemble supraparticles with high structural order that exhibit coloration from uniform, polyhedral metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) particles. We analyse the structural coloration as a function of the size of these anisotropic building blocks and their internal structure. We attribute the angle-dependent coloration of the MOF supraparticles to the presence of ordered, onion-like layers at the outermost regions. Surprisingly, even though different shapes of the MOF particles have different propensities to form these onion layers, all supraparticle dispersions show well-visible macroscopic coloration, indicating that local ordering is sufficient to generate interference effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuning Bulk O2 and Nonbonding Oxygen State for Reversible Anionic Redox Chemistry in P2&#8208;Layered Cathodes</title>

How to improve the reversibility of O&#8208;redox chemistry is particularly important for P2&#8208;type layered cathodes in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, the bulk O2 and nonbonding oxygen state for the reversible O&#8208;redox in P2&#8208;Na0.67Mn0.5Fe0.5O2 has been successfully tuned through a synergy of Li2TiO3 coating and Li/Ti co&#8208;doping. The underlying mechanism has been revealed by neutron diffraction, resonant inelastic X&#8208;ray scattering, density functional theory, etc.







Abstract
Improving the reversibility of oxygen redox is quite significant for layered oxides cathodes in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, we for the first time simultaneously tune bulk O2 and nonbonding oxygen state for reversible oxygen redox chemistry in P2&#8208;Na0.67Mn0.5Fe0.5O2 through a synergy of Li2TiO3 coating and Li/Ti co&#8208;doping. O2&#8722; is oxidized to molecular O2 and peroxide (O2)n&#8722; (n&lt;2) during charging. Molecular O2 derived from transition metal (TM) migration is related to the superstructure ordering induced by Li doping. The synergy mechanism of Li2TiO3 coating and Li/Ti co&#8208;doping on the two O&#8208;redox modes is revealed. Firstly, Li2TiO3 coating restrains the surface O2 and inhibits O2 loss. Secondly, nonbonding Li&#8722;O&#8722;Na enhances the reversibility of O2&#8722;&#8594;(O2)n&#8722;. Thirdly, Ti doping strengthens the TM&#8722;O bond which fixes lattice oxygen. The cationic redox reversibility is also enhanced by Li/Ti co&#8208;doping. The proposed insights into the oxygen redox reversibility are insightful for other oxide cathodes.

A second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) self&#8208;checking molecule, LET&#8208;1052, was developed for visualizing intracellular viscosity change and immediately predicting therapeutic efficacy of tumour turn&#8208;on photothermal therapy.







Abstract
We present a second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) self&#8208;checking molecule, LET&#8208;1052, for acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) turn&#8208;on photothermal therapy (PTT), followed by viscosity based therapeutic efficacy evaluation by itself in two independent channels, denoted as &#8220;self&#8208;checking&#8221; strategy. In acidic TME, LET&#8208;1052 was protonated and turned on NIR&#8208;II absorption for PTT under 1064&#8197;nm laser irradiation. Subsequently, PTT&#8208;induced cellular death increases intracellular viscosity, which inhibited the intramolecular rotation of LET&#8208;1052, resulting in the enhancement of NIR&#8208;I fluorescence for real&#8208;time evaluation of PTT efficacy. After PTT of tumor&#8208;bearing mice for different periods of NIR&#8208;II laser irradiation, NIR&#8208;I fluorescence in the tumor region showed positive correlation with tumor growth inhibition rate, demonstrating reliable and prompt prediction of PTT efficacy. The strategy may be expanded for instant evaluation of other therapeutic modalities for personalized medicine.

         <title>Controlled Disassembly of Elemental Sulfur: An Approach to the Precise Synthesis of Polydisulfides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for controlling the orderly disassembly of elemental sulfur (S8) in the presence of MTBD (a hindered organic base) and [PPN]SbF6 (an ammonium salt) is described for constructing polydisulfides by copolymerizing with episulfides. The &#8220;living polymerization&#8221; feature and good monomer compatibility of this copolymerization allows for the access to diverse polydisulfides with well&#8208;defined structures and excellent optical properties.







Abstract
The usage of elemental sulfur (S8) for constructing sulfur&#8208;containing polymers is of great significance in terms of sulfur resource utilization or fabrication of high&#8208;performance polymers. Currently, the random disassembly of S8 hinders its direct use in the precise synthesis of sulfur&#8208;containing polymers. Herein, we provide an effective strategy for controlling the dismantlement of S8 to synthesize polydisulfides, a promising category of dynamic bonds containing polymers. In this strategy, the completely alternating copolymerization of one sulfur atom, which is orderly derived from S8, with episulfides is achieved with MTBD (7&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene) as catalyst and [PPN]SbF6 ([PPN]+ is bis(triphenylphosphine)iminium) as cocatalyst. Delightedly, the living&#8208; polymerization feature, and the good monomer compatibility allows for the access to diverse polydisulfides. Furthermore, the density functional theory (DFT) was employed to elaborate the copolymerization process.

         <title>Streamline Sulfur Redox Reactions to Achieve Efficient Room&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering CoS2 as electron reservoirs overcomes the limited length of the electron diffusion tunnel over an insulating sulfur cathode and thus achieves fast reaction kinetics in sodium&#8211;sulfur batteries. With the assistance of Co1 single atoms, this strategy provides streamlined redox paths, which reduce the formation of unstable polysulfides and enable stable sodium&#8211;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
It is vital to dynamically regulate S activity to achieve efficient and stable room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT/Na&#8722;S) batteries. Herein, we report using cobalt sulfide as an electron reservoir to enhance the activity of sulfur cathodes, and simultaneously combining with cobalt single atoms as double&#8208;end binding sites for a stable S conversion process. The rationally constructed CoS2 electron reservoir enables the straight reduction of S to short&#8208;chain sodium polysulfides (Na2S4) via a streamlined redox path through electron transfer. Meanwhile, cobalt single atoms synergistically work with the electron reservoir to reinforce the streamlined redox path, which immobilize in situ formed long&#8208;chain products and catalyze their conversion, thus realizing high S utilization and sustainable cycling stability. The as&#8208;developed sulfur cathodes exhibit a superior rate performance of 443&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a high cycling capacity retention of 80&#8201;% after 5000 cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

The as-developed sulfur cathodes exhibit a superior rate performance of 443&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a high cycling capacity retention of 80&#8201;% after 5000 cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Support&#8208;Free PEDOT:PSS Fibers as Multifunctional Microelectrodes for In Vivo Neural Recording and Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Support&#8208;free PEDOT:PSS fibers and multifunctional microelectrodes based on them, which are mechanically compliant with neural tissues and exhibit significantly reduced foreign body responses, are developed not only for spatiotemporal neurochemical and electrophysiological recording in the same extracellular microspace in neural microcircuits, but also for neuromodulation by current&#8208;regulated electrostimulation.







Abstract
In vivo microelectrodes are essential for neuroscience studies. However, development of microelectrodes with both flexibility and multifunctionality for recording chemical and electrical signals in the same extracellular microspace and modulating neural activity remains challenging. Here, we find that pure PEDOT:PSS fibers (i.e., support&#8208;free) exhibit high conductivity, fast heterogeneous electron transfer, and suitable charge storage and injection capabilities, and can thus directly act as microelectrodes not only for chemical and electrophysiological recording in the same extracellular microspace, but also for electromodulation of neural microcircuit activity. Moreover, the microelectrodes mechanically match with neural tissues, exhibiting less foreign body responses. Given the multifunctionality, flexibility, and biocompatibility, the support&#8208;free PEDOT:PSS&#8208;based microelectrodes offer a new avenue to microelectrode technology for neuroscience research, diagnostics and therapeutics.

         <title>A Polymeric Nanobeacon for Monitoring the Fluctuation of Hydrogen Polysulfides during Fertilization and Embryonic Development</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluctuation of hydrogen polysulfide during the early embryonic development is revealed by a polymeric nanobeacon. A maximal level of H2Sn exists in the preliminary stage of embryogenesis, then the expression level of H2Sn was down&#8208;regulated with the development of the embryo.







Abstract
Fertilization and early embryonic development as the beginning of a new life are key biological events. Hydrogen polysulfide (H2Sn) plays important roles during physiological regulation, such as antioxidation&#8208;protection. However, no report has studied in situ H2Sn fluctuation during early embryonic development because of the low abundance of H2Sn and inadequate sensitivity of probes. We herein construct a polymeric nanobeacon from a H2Sn&#8208;responsive polymer and fluorophores, which is capable of detecting H2Sn selectively and of signal amplification. Taking the zebrafish as a model, the polymeric nanobeacon revealed that the H2Sn level was significantly elevated after fertilization due to the activation of cell multiplication, suppressed partially during embryonic development, and finally kept steady up to zebrafish emergence. This strategy is generally accessible for biomarkers by altering the responsive unit and significant for facilitating biological analysis during life development.

         <title>Engineering MoOx/MXene Hole Transfer Layers for Unexpected Boosting of Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXene quantum dots were grafted on a BiVO4 substrate, then a MoOx layer combining an ultrathin oxyhydroxide oxygen evolution cocatalyst was constructed as a promising model system of an integrated photoanode. The OEC/MoOx/MQD/BiVO4 array not only achieves a current density of 5.85&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;V vs. RHE, but also remarkably enhances photostability.







Abstract
The development of semiconductor photoanodes is of great practical interest for the realization of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Herein, MXene quantum dots (MQD) were grafted on a BiVO4 substrate, then a MoOx layer by combining an ultrathin oxyhydroxide oxygen evolution cocatalyst (OEC) was constructed as an integrated photoanode. The OEC/MoOx/MQD/BiVO4 array not only achieves a current density of 5.85&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE), but also enhances photostability. From electrochemical analysis and density functional theory calculations, high PEC performance is ascribed to the incorporation of MoOx/MQD as hole transfer layers, retarding charge recombination, promoting hole transfer and accelerating water splitting kinetics. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle work not only demonstrates the potential utilization of hole transfer layers, but also sheds light on rational design and fabrication of integrated photoanodes for feasible solar energy conversion.

         <title>Alkylgold(III) Complexes Undergo Unprecedented Photo&#8208;Induced &#946;&#8208;Hydride Elimination and Reduction for Targeted Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of alkylgold(III) complexes containing glucose moieties were identified to undergo unprecedented photo&#8208;induced &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination and reduction, leading to cancer&#8208;selective cellular uptake, potent inhibition on thioredoxin reductase, up to 400&#8208;fold increase of cytotoxicity in vitro, and strong antiangiogenic and anti&#8208;tumor activities in two animal models.







Abstract
Spatiotemporally controllable activation of prodrugs within tumors is highly desirable for cancer therapy to minimize toxic side effects. Herein we report that stable alkylgold(III) complexes can undergo unprecedented photo&#8208;induced &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination, releasing alkyl ligands and forming gold(III)&#8208;hydride intermediates that could be quickly converted into bioactive [AuIII&#8722;S] adducts; meanwhile, the remaining alkylgold(III) complexes can photo&#8208;catalytically reduce [AuIII&#8722;S] into more bioactive AuI species. Such photo&#8208;reactivities make it possible to functionalize gold complexes on the auxiliary alkyl ligands without attenuating the metal&#8211;biomacromolecule interactions. As a result, the gold(III) complexes containing glucose&#8208;functionalized alkyl ligands displayed efficient and tumor&#8208;selective uptake; notably, after one&#8208; or two&#8208;photon activation, the complexes exhibited high thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) inhibition, potent cytotoxicity, and strong antiangiogenesis and antitumor activities in vivo.

         <title>Combining a Genetically Engineered Oxidase with Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks (HOFs) for Highly Efficient Biocomposites</title>

Immobilization of d&#8208;amino acid oxidase in crystalline frameworks at high protein loading is reported. A biocomposite of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (BioHOF&#8208;1) shows excellent retention of activity. Fusion to the positively charged module Zbasic2 (Z&#8208;DAAO) promotes incorporation of the active enzyme. Protein engineering can facilitate development of framework&#8208;based enzyme composites, as shown with three further examples of industrial enzymes.







Abstract
Enzymes incorporated into hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) via bottom&#8208;up synthesis are promising biocomposites for applications in catalysis and sensing. Here, we explored synthetic incorporation of d&#8208;amino acid oxidase (DAAO) with the metal&#8208;free tetraamidine/tetracarboxylate&#8208;based BioHOF&#8208;1 in water. N&#8208;terminal enzyme fusion with the positively charged module Zbasic2 strongly boosted the loading (2.5&#8208;fold; &#8776;500&#8197;mg enzyme gmaterial&#8722;1) and the specific activity (6.5&#8208;fold; 23&#8197;U&#8201;mg&#8722;1). The DAAO@BioHOF&#8208;1 composites showed superior activity with respect to every reported carrier for the same enzyme and excellent stability during catalyst recycling. Further, extension to other enzymes, including cytochrome P450 BM3 (used in the production of high&#8208;value oxyfunctionalized compounds), points to the versatility of genetic engineering as a strategy for the preparation of biohybrid systems with unprecedented properties.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of Hyperforin and Pyrohyperforin</title>

         <dc:description>
A 9&#8208;step enantioselective total synthesis of both (+)&#8208;hyperforin and its pyran congener (+)&#8208;pyrohyperforin is described herein. The synthesis highlights a late&#8208;stage 1,3&#8208;diene diversification, including an abiotic cyclization cascade for pyran formation, and a selective 1,4&#8208;semihydrogenation of polyenes.







Abstract
Capitalizing on the late&#8208;stage diversification of an essential 1,3&#8208;diene intermediate, we describe herein a 9&#8208;step enantioselective total synthesis of (+)&#8208;hyperforin and (+)&#8208;pyrohyperforin, starting from commercially available allylacetone. Our convergent synthesis features a series of critical reactions: 1) an enantioselective deconjugative &#945;&#8208;alkylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acid using chiral lithium amides as noncovalent stereodirecting auxiliaries; 2) a HfCl4&#8208;mediated carbonyl &#945;&#8208;tert&#8208;alkylation to forge the intricate bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane framework; 3) an abiotic cascade pyran formation; and 4) a selective 1,4&#8208;semihydrogenation of polyenes. During the course of our synthesis, we also identified a 1,2&#8208;cyclopropanediol overbred intermediate which was responsible for the 1,3&#8208;diene precursor formation through a controlled fragmentation.

         <title>Ferroptosis&#8208;Enhanced Cancer Immunity by a Ferrocene&#8208;Appended Iridium(III) Diphosphine Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroptosis&#8208;inducing agents have potential as antitumor candidates. A ferrocene&#8208;modified IrIII complex with Fenton&#8208;like catalytic activity is used to disturb the cellular redox balance, which leads to lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis of cancer cells. Ferroptosis induced by the IrIII complex causes immunogenic cell death (ICD) of cancer cell in&#8197;vitro, which enhances cancer immune response in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Ferroptosis is a programmed cell death pathway discovered in recent years, and ferroptosis&#8208;inducing agents have great potential as new antitumor candidates. Here, we report a IrIII complex (Ir1) containing a ferrocene&#8208;modified diphosphine ligand that localizes in lysosomes. Under the acidic environments of lysosomes, Ir1 can effectively catalyze Fenton&#8208;like reaction, produce hydroxyl radicals, induce lipid peroxidation, down&#8208;regulate glutathione peroxidase 4, and result in ferroptosis. RNA sequencing analysis shows that Ir1 can significantly affect pathways related to ferroptosis and cancer immunity. Accordingly, Ir1 can induce immunogenic cells death and suppress tumor growth in vitro, regulate T cell activity and immune microenvironments in vivo. In conclusion, we show the potential of small molecules with ferroptosis&#8208;inducing capabilities for effective cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to CO/CH4 Using a Metal&#8211;Organic &#8220;Soft&#8221; Coordination Polymer Gel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porphyrin&#8208;based coordination polymer gel (CPG) has been developed for visible/sunlight&#8208;driven CO2 reduction. Notably, the product of CO2 reduction can be modulated by changing the sacrificial electron donor (SED). Ru&#8208;TPY&#8208;POR CPG upon photocatalytic CO2 reduction produces CO (3.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with &gt;99&#8201;% selectivity in presence of TEA as SED), whereas in presence of both BNAH and TEA as SED, Ru&#8208;TPY&#8208;POR CPG produces CH4 (6.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with &gt;95&#8201;% selectivity).







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of a well&#8208;defined and astutely designed, low&#8208;molecular weight gelator (LMWG) based linker with a suitable metal ion is a promising method for preparing photocatalytically active coordination polymer gels. Here, we report the design, synthesis, and gelation behaviour of a tetrapodal LMWG based on a porphyrin core connected to four terpyridine units (TPY&#8208;POR) through amide linkages. The self&#8208;assembly of TPY&#8208;POR LMWG with RuII ions results in a Ru&#8208;TPY&#8208;POR coordination polymer gel (CPG), with a nanoscroll morphology. Ru&#8208;TPY&#8208;POR CPG exhibits efficient CO2 photoreduction to CO (3.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) with &gt;99&#8201;% selectivity in the presence of triethylamine (TEA) as a sacrificial electron donor. Interestingly, in the presence of 1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide (BNAH) with TEA as the sacrificial electron donor, the 8e&#8722;/8H+ photoreduction of CO2 to CH4 is realized with &gt;95&#8201;% selectivity (6.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). In CPG, porphyrin acts as a photosensitizer and covalently attached [Ru(TPY)2]2+ acts as a catalytic center as demonstrated by femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy. Further, combining information from the in situ DRIFT spectroscopy and DFT calculation, a possible reaction mechanism for CO2 reduction to CO and CH4 was outlined.

         <title>Double Lock Label Based on Thermosensitive Polymer Hydrogels for Information Camouflage and Multilevel Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double lock encryption strategy with both temperature and time as keys and excellent comprehensive capabilities has been established via a combination of lower critical and upper critical solution temperature (LCST and UCST) thermosensitive polymer hydrogels, of which the phase transition temperature and time can be arbitrarily tailored by changing the contents of monomer and crosslinker in their networks. This strategy provides powerful double insurances for confidential information.







Abstract
Developing extra safety encryption technologies to prevent information leakage and combat fakes is in high demand but is challenging. Herein, we propose a &#8220;double lock&#8221; strategy based on both lower critical solution temperature (LCST) and upper critical solution temperature (UCST) polymer hydrogels for information camouflage and multilevel encryption. Two types of hydrogels were synthesized by the method of random copolymerization. The number of &#8722;CO&#8722;NH2 groups in the network structure of the hydrogels changed the enthalpic or entropic thermo&#8208;responsive hydrogels, and ultimately precisely controlled their phase transition temperature. The crosslink density of the polymer hydrogels governs the diffusion kinetics, resulting in a difference in the time for their color change. The combination of multiple LCST and UCST hydrogels in one label realized information encryption and dynamic information identification in the dimensions of both time and temperature. This work is highly interesting for the fields of information encryption, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and smart responsive materials.

         <title>Extraordinary p&#8211;d Hybridization Interaction in Heterostructural Pd&#8208;PdSe Nanosheets Boosts C&#8722;C Bond Cleavage of Ethylene Glycol Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tensile strain effect and extraordinary p&#8211;d hybridization interaction that co&#8208;exist on Pd&#8208;PdSe heterostructural nanosheets could effectively boost the C&#8722;C bond breaking in the ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR) and enhance the catalytic performance.







Abstract
Advanced electrocatalysts for complete oxidation of ethylene glycol (EG) in direct EG fuel cells are strongly desired owing to the higher energy efficiency. Herein, Pd&#8208;PdSe heterostructural nanosheets (Pd&#8208;PdSe HNSs) have been successfully fabricated via a one&#8208;step approach. These Pd&#8208;PdSe HNSs feature unique electronic and geometrical structures, in which unconventional p&#8211;d hybridization interactions and tensile strain effect co&#8208;exist. Compared with commercial Pd/C and Pd NSs catalysts, Pd&#8208;PdSe HNSs display 5.5 (6.6) and 2.5 (2.6) fold enhancement of specific (mass) activity for the EG oxidation reaction (EGOR). Especially, the optimum C1 pathway selectivity of Pd&#8208;PdSe HNSs reaches 44.3&#8201;%, illustrating the superior C&#8722;C bond cleavage ability. Electrochemical in situ FTIR spectroscopy and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the extraordinary p&#8211;d hybridization interaction and tensile strain effect could effectively reduce the activation energy of C&#8722;C bond breaking and accelerate CO* oxidation, boosting the complete oxidation of EG and improving the catalytic performance.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Free Alternating Conjugated Polymers Enabled by Room&#8208; Temperature Stille Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of conjugated polymers (CPs) often suffers from high temperature and indistinct homocoupling structural defects. In this study, the first room&#8208;temperature Stille cross&#8208;coupling polymerization was explored. Surprisingly, this method produced defect&#8208;free CPs, which enhanced their charge transport properties. Therefore, this work paves the road for the development of plastic electronics and optoelectronics.







Abstract
The Stille cross&#8208;coupling polymerization is one of the most efficient synthetic methods for donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) type &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (CPs). Nevertheless, thermal&#8208;activation Stille polymerization readily produced homocoupling defects, resulting in batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variations in copolymers quality and deteriorating the device performance of electronics and optoelectronics. Here, a room&#8208;temperature Stille&#8208;type polymerization was developed, the utility and generality of which were demonstrated by synthesis of twelve D&#8211;A CPs with high molecular weights. Importantly, the resultant copolymers possessed no homocoupling (hc) structural defects, while hc reactions were observed in the thermal&#8208;activation Stille reactions. Thus, the organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) based on the former exhibited twofold higher charge transport mobility (2.10&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), since it possessed stronger crystallinity and lower trap density of states (tDOS).

         <title>DNA&#8208;Damage&#8208;Response&#8208;Targeting Mitochondria&#8208;Activated Multifunctional Prodrug Strategy for Self&#8208;Defensive Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new multifunctional construct M1 combining a floxuridine (FUDR) with a protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor is presented. M1 targets the DNA damage response of cancer cells by inhibiting the PP2A activity and inducing mitochondrial and nucleus DNA damage&#8208;mediated apoptosis.







Abstract
We report a novel multifunctional construct, M1, designed explicitly to target the DNA damage response in cancer cells. M1 contains both a floxuridine (FUDR) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor combined with a GSH&#8208;sensitive linker. Further conjugation of the triphenylphosphonium moiety allows M1 to undergo specific activation in the mitochondria, where mitochondria&#8208;mediated apoptosis is observed. Moreover, M1 has enormous effects on genomic DNA ascribed to FUDR's primary function of impeding DNA/RNA synthesis combined with diminishing PP2A&#8208;activated DNA repair pathways. Importantly, mechanistic studies highlight the PP2A obtrusion in FUDR/5&#8208;fluorouracil (5&#8208;FU) therapy and underscore the importance of its inhibition to harbor therapeutic potential. HCT116 cell xenograft&#8208;bearing mice that have a low response rate to 5&#8208;FU show a prominent effect with M1, emphasizing the importance of DNA damage response targeting strategies using tumor&#8208;specific microenvironment&#8208;activatable systems.

         <title>Intercalation&#8208;Activated Layered MoO3 Nanobelts as Biodegradable Nanozymes for Tumor&#8208;Specific Photo&#8208;Enhanced Catalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous intercalation is proposed here as a promising strategy to activate the enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalytic activity of layered MoO3 nanobelts for the generation of reactive oxygen species including &#8901;OH and &#8901;O2&#8722; in a tumor microenvironment, making it an efficient biodegradable nanozyme for tumor&#8208;specific photo&#8208;enhanced catalytic therapy.







Abstract
The existence of natural van der Waals gaps in layered materials allows them to be easily intercalated with varying guest species, offering an appealing strategy to optimize their physicochemical properties and application performance. Herein, we report the activation of layered MoO3 nanobelts via aqueous intercalation as an efficient biodegradable nanozyme for tumor&#8208;specific photo&#8208;enhanced catalytic therapy. The long MoO3 nanobelts are grinded and then intercalated with Na+ and H2O to obtain the short Na+/H2O co&#8208;intercalated MoO3&#8722;x (NH&#8722;MoO3&#8722;x) nanobelts. In contrast to the inert MoO3 nanobelts, the NH&#8722;MoO3&#8722;x nanobelts exhibit excellent enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalytic activity for generation of reactive oxygen species, which can be further enhanced by the photothermal effect under a 1064&#8197;nm laser irradiation. Thus, after bovine serum albumin modification, the NH&#8722;MoO3&#8722;x nanobelts can efficiently kill cancer cells in vitro and eliminate tumors in vivo facilitating with 1064&#8197;nm laser irradiation.

The long MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanobelts are grinded and then intercalated with Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to obtain the short Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O co-intercalated MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; (NH&#8722;MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;) nanobelts. In contrast to the inert MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanobelts, the NH&#8722;MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; nanobelts exhibit excellent enzyme-mimicking catalytic activity for generation of reactive oxygen species, which can be further enhanced by the photothermal effect under a 1064&#8197;nm laser irradiation. Thus, after bovine serum albumin modification, the NH&#8722;MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; nanobelts can efficiently kill cancer cells in vitro and eliminate tumors in vivo facilitating with 1064&#8197;nm laser irradiation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Luciferin Synthesis and Pesticide Detection by Luminescence Enzymatic Cascades</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymatic reactions were developed to convert 19 phenolic derivatives containing halogen, nitro, and methyl substituents into eight D&#8208;luciferin analogues, including the novel compounds 4&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;D&#8208;luciferin and 5&#8242;&#8208;methyl&#8208;D&#8208;luciferin, which emit brighter and longer&#8208;wavelength light than the native D&#8208;luciferin. These reactions enabled the further development of luminescence technology for the sensitive detection of organophosphate pesticides.







Abstract
D&#8208;Luciferin (D&#8208;LH2), a substrate of firefly luciferase (Fluc), is important for a wide range of bioluminescence applications. This work reports a new and green method using enzymatic reactions (HELP, HadA Enzyme for Luciferin Preparation) to convert 19 phenolic derivatives to 8 D&#8208;LH2 analogues with &#8776;51&#8201;% yield. The method can synthesize the novel 5&#8242;&#8208;methyl&#8208;D&#8208;LH2 and 4&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;D&#8208;LH2, which have never been synthesized or found in nature. 5&#8242;&#8208;Methyl&#8208;D&#8208;LH2 emits brighter and longer wavelength light than the D&#8208;LH2. Using HELP, we further developed LUMOS (Luminescence Measurement of Organophosphate and Derivatives) technology for in situ detection of organophosphate pesticides (OPs) including parathion, methyl parathion, EPN, profenofos, and fenitrothion by coupling the reactions of OPs hydrolase and Fluc. The LUMOS technology can detect these OPs at parts per trillion (ppt) levels. The method can directly detect OPs in food and biological samples without requiring sample pretreatment.

         <title>Unmasking the Critical Role of the Ordering Degree of Bimetallic Nanocatalysts on Oxygen Reduction Reaction by In Situ Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>

The critical role of the ordering degree of AuCu bimetallic catalysts was studied in&#8197;situ by a shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy satellite strategy and the molecular reaction mechanism is revealed.







Abstract
Precise control and accurate understanding of the ordering degree of bimetallic nanocatalysts (BNs) are challenging yet crucial to acquire advanced materials for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). AuCu BNs with various ordering degrees were synthesized to evaluate the influence of ordering degree on the ORR at a molecular level using in&#8197;situ Raman spectroscopy. The activity of AuCu BNs was improved by over 2&#8197;times after a disorder&#8208;to&#8208;order transition, making the performance of highly ordered AuCu BNs exceed that of benchmark Pt/C. Direct Raman spectroscopic evidence of key intermediate (*OH) demonstrates that the active site is the combination site of Au and Cu. Moreover, two distinct *OH species are observed on the ordered and disordered structure, and the ordered site is more beneficial for ORR due to its lower affinity to *OH. This work deepens the understanding on the important role of ordering degree on BNs and enables the design of improved catalysts.

         <title>Overturned Loading of Inert CeO2 to Active Co3O4 for Unusually Improved Catalytic Activity in Fenton&#8208;Like Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique overturned loading strategy for the preparation of Co3O4 nanocomposites by loading inert CeO2 onto active Co3O4 is described. Such a design generates abundant surface oxygen vacancies neighboring Co and Ce as new active sites, resulting in unusually improved catalytic activity in both Fenton&#8208;like reaction and beyond, for instance, CO oxidation.







Abstract
In the past decades, numerous efforts have been devoted to improving the catalytic activity of nanocomposites by either exposing more active sites or regulating the interaction between the support and nanoparticles while keeping the structure of the active sites unchanged. Here, we report the fabrication of a Co3O4&#8722;CeO2 nanocomposite via overturning the loading direction, i.e., loading an inert CeO2 support onto active Co3O4 nanoparticles. The resultant catalyst exhibits unexpectedly higher activity and stability in peroxymonosulfate&#8208;based Fenton&#8208;like reactions than its analog prepared by the traditional impregnation method. Abundant oxygen vacancies (Ov with a Co&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ov&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ce structure instead of Co&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ov) are generated as new active sites to facilitate the cleavage of the peroxide bond to produce SO4.&#8722; and accelerate the rate&#8208;limiting step, i.e., the desorption of SO4.&#8722;, affording improved activity. This strategy is a new direction for boosting the catalytic activity of nanocomposite catalysts in various scenarios, including environmental remediation and energy applications.

         <title>Phosphorogenic Iridium(III) bis&#8208;Tetrazine Complexes for Bioorthogonal Peptide Stapling, Bioimaging, Photocytotoxic Applications, and the Construction of Nanosized Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel iridium(III) bis&#8208;tetrazine complexes that displayed significant phosphorogenic response toward (1R,8S,9s)&#8208;bicyclo[6.1.0]non&#8208;4&#8208;yne (BCN) derivatives were synthesized and characterized. The complexes were exploited for peptide stapling and cross&#8208;labeling of BCN&#8208;modified peptides. They were also utilized in bioimaging, singlet oxygen photosensitization, and the construction of luminescent nanosized hydrogels.







Abstract
The dual functionality of 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine as a bioorthogonal reactive unit and a luminescence quencher has shaped tetrazine&#8208;based probes as attractive candidates for luminogenic labeling of biomolecules in living systems. In this work, three cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes featuring two tetrazine units were synthesized and characterized. Upon photoexcitation, the complexes were non&#8208;emissive but displayed up to 3900&#8208;fold emission enhancement upon the inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) [4+2] cycloaddition with (1R,8S,9s)&#8208;bicyclo[6.1.0]non&#8208;4&#8208;yne (BCN) substrates. The rapid reaction kinetics (k2 up to 1.47&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) of the complexes toward BCN substrates allowed effective peptide labeling. The complexes were also applied as live cell bioimaging reagents and photocytotoxic agents. One of the complexes was utilized in the preparation of luminescent nanosized hydrogels that exhibited interesting cargo delivery properties.

         <title>Unprecedented and Readily Tunable Photoluminescence from Aliphatic Quaternary Ammonium Salts**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprecedented intrinsic fluorescence/phosphorescence dual emissions are observed from the solids of aliphatic quaternary ammonium salts (QASs), with &#934;c and &lt;&#964;&gt;p of up to 14.7&#8201;% and 762&#8197;ms, respectively. By adjusting the alkyl chain length/counterions or through physical blending and grinding, multicolor emissions from blue to orange&#8208;red and white are realized, which enables advanced multimode anticounterfeiting for QASs.







Abstract
Compounds bearing aliphatic amines can be emissive under appropriate conditions. However, their ionized counterparts, namely, quaternary ammonium salts (QASs), which are widely used as phase&#8208;transfer catalysts, ionic liquids, disinfectants, and surfactants, are known as luminescence quenchers and considered nonemissive. Herein, unprecedented intrinsic fluorescence/phosphorescence dual emissions from various QASs are reported, which can be finely regulated by changing the excitation wavelength, alkyl chain length, counterion, and mechanical stimuli. The bright photoluminescence along with distinct afterglow and tunable multicolor emissions enables the application of QAS solids in advanced multimode anticounterfeiting. This finding refreshes the understanding of QASs and may inspire emerging applications based on the utilization of the intrinsic luminescences of QASs. Furthermore, it opens opportunities for the investigation of QAS&#8208;related processes and functions via a photophysical approach and affords strong implications for the fabrication of novel nonconventional luminophores.

         <title>Inverse Vulcanization of Norbornenylsilanes: Soluble Polymers with Controllable Molecular Properties via Siloxane Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inverse vulcanized polymers of norbornenylsilanes with hydrolysable chloro&#8208; and ethoxy substituents were prepared and polycondensated to install defined amounts of M, D, or T siloxane bonds. The MW and TG of the soluble and branched polymers containing 50&#8197;wt&#8201;% S could be varied systematically, whereas the elemental composition remained the same. Polymers with a sulfur content of 30&#8197;wt&#8201;% could be prepared without low molar mass impurities.







Abstract
The inverse vulcanization produces high sulfur content polymers from alkenes and elemental sulfur. Control over properties such as the molar mass or the solubility of polymers is not well established, and existing strategies lack predictability or require large variations of the composition. Systematic design principles are sought to allow for a targeted design of materials. Herein, we report on the inverse vulcanization of norbornenylsilanes (NBS), with a different number of hydrolysable groups at the silicon atom. Inverse vulcanization of mixtures of NBS followed by polycondensation yielded soluble high sulfur content copolymers (50&#8197;wt&#8201;% S) with controllable weight average molar mass (MW), polydispersity (&#272;), glass transition temperature (TG), or zero&#8208;shear viscosity (&#951;0). Polycondensation was conducted in the melt with HCl as a catalyst, abolishing the need for a solvent. Purification by precipitation afforded polymers with a greatly reduced amount of low molar mass species.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Level Insights into the Notorious CO Poisoning of Platinum Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The occupancy and energy of metal d electrons are the two vital factors in d&#8208;band theory. These factors have an effect on CO poisoning with distinct scaling relationships. An increase of Pt 5d band energy strengthens the competitive adsorption between CO and hydrogen, while a decrease of Pt 5d band occupancy lowers the site coverage of CO to promote its association with oxygen.







Abstract
Carbon monoxide (CO) is notorious for its strong adsorption to poison platinum group metal catalysts in the chemical industry. Here, we conceptually distinguish and quantify the effects of the occupancy and energy of d electrons, emerging as the two vital factors in d&#8208;band theory, for CO poisoning of Pt nanocatalysts. The stepwise defunctionalization of carbon support is adopted to fine&#8208;tune the 5d electronic structure of supported Pt nanoparticles. Excluding other promotional mechanisms, the increase of Pt 5d band energy strengthens the competitive adsorption of hydrogen against CO for the preferential oxidation of CO, affording the scaling relationship between Pt 5d band energy and CO/H2 adsorption energy difference. The decrease of Pt 5d band occupancy lowers CO site coverage to promote its association with oxygen for the total oxidation of CO, giving the scaling relationship between Pt 5d occupancy and activation energy. The above insights outline a molecular&#8208;level understanding of CO poisoning.

         <title>Cation&#8208;Tuning Induced d&#8208;Band Center Modulation on Co&#8208;Based Spinel Oxide for Oxygen Reduction/Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Co&#8208;based spinel oxides coupled with N&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes were synthesized as electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction. The cation&#8208;tuning induced ATd&#8208;O&#8208;BOh corner&#8208;sharing effect enables the modulation and optimization of the electronic structure of Co&#8208;based spinel oxides, resulting in the superior electrocatalytic activity.







Abstract
Atomic substitutions at the tetrahedral site (ATd) could theoretically achieve an efficient optimization of the charge at the octahedral site (BOh) through the ATd&#8208;O&#8208;BOh interactions in the spinel oxides (AB2O4). Despite substantial progress having been made, the precise control and adjustment of the spinel oxides are still challenging owing to the complexity of their crystal structure. In this work, we demonstrate a simple solvent method to tailor the structures of spinel oxides and use the spinel oxide composites (ACo2O4/NCNTs, A=Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) for oxygen electrocatalysis. The optimized MnCo2O4/NCNTs exhibit high activity and excellent durability for oxygen reduction/evolution reactions. Remarkably, the rechargeable liquid Zn&#8211;air battery equipped with a MnCo2O4/NCNTs cathode affords a specific capacity of 827&#8197;mAh&#8201;gZn&#8722;1 with a high power density of 74.63&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and no voltage degradation after 300 cycles at a high charging&#8211;discharging rate (5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the substitution could regulate the ratio of Co3+/Co2+ and thereby lead to the modulation of the electronic structure accompanied with the movement of the d&#8208;band center. The tetrahedral and octahedral sites interact through the Mn&#8722;O&#8722;Co, and the Co3+Oh of MnCo2O4 with the optimal charge structure allows a more suitable binding interaction between the active center and the oxygenated species, resulting in superior oxygen electrocatalytic performance.

         <title>Alkynyl Sulfonium Salts Can Be Employed as Chalcogen&#8208;Bonding Catalysts and Generate Alkynyl Radicals under Blue&#8208;Light Irradiation</title>

Alkynyl sulfonium salts were employed as chalcogen bonding (ChB) catalysts for the first time. They display superior capability in the generation of alkynyl radicals under blue&#8208;light irradiation.







Abstract
Chalcogen bonding (ChB) has emerged as a promising tool in organic synthesis. However, compared with the well&#8208;developed selenium&#8208; and tellurium&#8208;based salt catalysts, the ChB catalysis of sulfonium salts is still unknown. Here, we report a new type of alkynyl&#8208;sulfonium salt ChB catalysis for various ionic transformations, including transfer hydrogenation, bromination, bromolactonization, dimerization of 1,1&#8208;diphenylethylene, nitro&#8208;Michael addition reaction and Ritter reaction. More importantly, the photocapability of ChB was first demonstrated to generate alkynyl radicals for the synthesis of a variety of chalcogenoacetylenes. Mechanistic studies shed light on the mechanism of the photoinduced reactions and confirmed the involvement of alkynyl radicals which are difficult to generate otherwise.

         <title>Topochemical Synthesis of a Heterochiral Peptide Polymer in Different Polymorphic Forms from Crystals and Aerogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ordering polymers in different packing modes is an ideal method to get different properties from a polymer, but a challenging task. In this study, two polymorphs of a heterochiral dipeptide yielded pseudopolypeptides in parallel and antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet arrangements upon topochemical polymerization (see picture). Synthesis of the parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet polymer could be scaled up by using an aerogel.







Abstract
We have designed a heterochiral dipeptide monomer (N3&#8208;D&#8208;Ala&#8208;L&#8208;Val&#8208;NHCH2C&#8801;CH) modified with an azide group and an alkyne at its termini for topochemical azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) polymerization. We obtained two different polymorphs: PI (P21) from a DCM&#8211;toluene mixture, and PII (P&#8208;1) from a hexane&#8211;ethyl acetate mixture. PI adopts parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet packing, and PII adopts antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet packing. In both the cases, molecules from adjacent &#946;&#8208;stacks are arranged in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail manner. On heating, the polymorphs underwent TAAC reaction to form linear polymers having parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;like ordering (PI) and an antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet structure (PII). PI reacted spontaneously at room temperature and the crystals showed cracking after the reaction, but PII was intact even after complete reaction. The dipeptide congealed various solvents, and the aerogels were identical to PI. These aerogels also underwent spontaneous TAAC reaction at room temperature to yield a pseudoprotein with alternate D&#8208; and L&#8208;amino acids.

         <title>Rapid and Controlled Polymerization of Bio&#8208;sourced &#948;&#8208;Caprolactone toward Fully Recyclable Polyesters and Thermoplastic Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of &#948;&#8208;caprolactone (&#948;CL) to produce high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight P&#948;CL that was capable to recycle back to pristine monomer with an almost quantitative yield (&#8776;99&#8201;%). Well&#8208;defined PLLA&#8208;b&#8208;P&#948;CL&#8208;b&#8208;PLLA triblock copolymers with excellent mechanical properties can be easily prepared by sequential ROP of &#948;CL and l&#8208;lactide.







Abstract
The development of chemically recyclable polymers presents the most appealing solution to address the plastics&#8217; end&#8208;of&#8208;use problem. Despite the recent advancements, it is highly desirable to develop chemically recyclable polymers from commercially available monomers to avoid the costly and time&#8208;consuming commercialization. In this contribution, we achieve the controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of bio&#8208;sourced &#948;&#8208;caprolactone (&#948;CL) using strong base/urea binary catalysts. The obtained P&#948;CL is capable of chemical recycling to &#948;CL in an almost quantitative yield by thermolysis. Sequential ROP of &#948;CL and l&#8208;lactide (l&#8208;LA) affords well&#8208;defined PLLA&#8208;b&#8208;P&#948;CL&#8208;b&#8208;PLLA triblock copolymers, which behave as thermoplastic elastomers with excellent elastic recovery, tensile strength and ultimate elongation. The upcycling of PLLA&#8208;b&#8208;P&#948;CL&#8208;b&#8208;PLLA to recover ethyl lactate and &#948;CL with high yields is achieved by refluxing with ethanol and then distillation under reduced pressure.

         <title>Chemical Defect&#8208;Driven Response on Graphene&#8208;Based Chemiresistors for Sub&#8208;ppm Ammonia Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent functionalization of graphene leads to excellent sensitivity for ammonia. Quick response and recovery of the functionalized graphene layers are observed, and a sensitivity benchmarking with other graphene chemiresistors shows a superior sensitivity in the sub&#8208;ppm range.







Abstract
Gas sensors are essential in several fields and, in general, features such as high sensitivity, quick response, and fast recovery are required, along with low power consumption and low cost. Graphene is considered a promising material for gas sensing applications, its functionalization often being a requisite. In the present study, we developed competitive and promising gas sensors for ammonia detection. Interestingly, we present an easy and efficient method to functionalize graphene by using diazonium chemistry with different functional groups. Moreover, we prove the superior sensing capability of our covalently modified graphene layers. These experimental data have been consistently interpreted by theoretical calculations, which reveal a defect&#8208;driven sensor's response to ammonia. These results open the possibility of a comprehensive design and use of these graphene&#8208;based sensors in real applications.

         <title>Back Cover: Defect&#8208;Free Alternating Conjugated Polymers Enabled by Room&#8208; Temperature Stille Polymerization (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 16/2022)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect&#8208;free alternating conjugated polymers were produced by exploring palladium&#8208;catalyzed Stille polymerization at room temperature. The selected copolymers demonstrated no homocoupling defects and superior charge transport properties, thus paving the road for the development of plastic electronics. Details of this study are reported by Qinqin Shi, Hui Huang, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202115969).

The enzymatic synthesis of eight luciferin analogues from phenolic derivatives in one&#8208;pot reactions is reported by Pimchai Chaiyen and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202116908). Two novel D&#8208;luciferin analogues with methyl substituents were obtained; these compounds emit red and brighter light than the native D&#8208;luciferin. A new detection technology named LUMOS was also developed for in&#8197;situ detection of organophosphate pesticides (OPs), including parathion, methyl parathion, EPN, profenofos, and fenitrothion, at parts per trillion (ppt) levels without requiring sample pretreatment.

The DNA damage response , which includes DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint pathways in cancer cells, has been considered one of the main impediments to traditional chemotherapy. In their Research Article (e202117075), Na Kong, Xingcai Zhang, Wei Tao, Jong&#8197;Seung Kim, and co&#8208;workers developed a multifunctional construct, M1, to target the DNA damage response of cancer cells. The findings identified a critical role of DNA damage repair pathways during 5&#8208;FU/FUDR therapy and underscore the role of inhibition of these pathways in sensitizing cancer cells to chemotherapeutics.

Chalcogen bonding (ChB) is a type of &#963;&#8208;hole interaction between a Group&#8197;16 chalcogen atom bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups and a Lewis base. In their Research Article (e202116071), Xiang&#8208;Yu Chen, Zhi&#8208;Xiang Wang, and co&#8208;workers show that ChB of alkynyl sulfonium salts enables the generation of alkynyl radicals for the synthesis of a variety of chalcogenoacetylenes with diselenides under blue&#8208;light irradiation.

         <title>Unraveling Charge&#8208;Separation Mechanisms in Photocatalyst Particles by Spatially Resolved Surface Photovoltage Techniques</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge separation is key to efficient photocatalytic solar energy conversion. The distribution of surface charge on photocatalysts can be identified and the driving forces of charge separation quantitatively determined at the nanoscale by the spatially resolved surface photovoltage technique. The identification of photocatalytic charge separation mechanisms will enable the rational design of efficient photocatalytic systems.







Abstract
The photocatalytic conversion of solar energy offers a potential route to renewable energy, and its efficiency relies on effective charge separation in nanostructured photocatalysts. Understanding the charge&#8208;separation mechanism is key to improving the photocatalytic performance and this has now been enabled by advances in the spatially resolved surface photovoltage (SRSPV) method. In this Review we highlight progress made by SRSPV in mapping charge distributions at the nanoscale and determining the driving forces of charge separation in heterogeneous photocatalyst particles. We discuss how charge separation arising from a built&#8208;in electric field, diffusion, and trapping can be exploited and optimized through photocatalyst design. We also highlight the importance of asymmetric engineering of photocatalysts for effective charge separation. Finally, we provide an outlook on further opportunities that arise from leveraging these insights to guide the rational design of photocatalysts and advance the imaging technique to expand the knowledge of charge separation.

         <title>Synthetic Cells: From Simple Bio&#8208;Inspired Modules to Sophisticated Integrated Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review highlights strategies used to build synthetic cells and organelles from scratch. These cell&#8208;like materials, which mimic the structure and function of natural cells, represent the next generation of biologically inspired smart systems. The discussion begins by describing basic functions and components, such as energy supply and compartmentalization, and evolves into systems with an increasing degree of sophistication.







Abstract
Bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology is the science of building systems that mimic the structure and function of living cells from scratch. To do this, researchers combine tools from chemistry, materials science, and biochemistry to develop functional and structural building blocks to construct synthetic cell&#8208;like systems. The many strategies and materials that have been developed in recent decades have enabled scientists to engineer synthetic cells and organelles that mimic the essential functions and behaviors of natural cells. Examples include synthetic cells that can synthesize their own ATP using light, maintain metabolic reactions through enzymatic networks, perform gene replication, and even grow and divide. In this Review, we discuss recent developments in the design and construction of synthetic cells and organelles using the bottom&#8208;up approach. Our goal is to present representative synthetic cells of increasing complexity as well as strategies for solving distinct challenges in bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology.

         <title>Identification of a Two&#8208;Coordinate Iron(I)&#8211;Oxalate Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Evidence for iron in its unusual oxidation state +I is found from a study on a series of iron&#8211;oxalate complexes in solution and involving a combination of infrared free liquid matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, cryogenic ion trap vibrational spectroscopy and ab initio calculations.







Abstract
Exotic oxidation states of the first&#8208;row transition metals have recently attracted much interest. In order to investigate the oxidation states of a series of iron&#8211;oxalate complexes, an aqueous solution of iron(III) nitrate and oxalic acid was studied by infrared free liquid matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization as well as ionspray mass spectrometry. Here, we show that iron is not only detected in its common oxidation states +II and +III, but also in its unusual oxidation state +I, detectable in both positive&#8208;ion and in negative&#8208;ion modes, respectively. Vibrational spectra of the gas phase anionic iron oxalate complexes [FeIII(C2O4)2]&#8722;, [FeII(C2O4)CO2]&#8722;, and [FeI(C2O4)]&#8722; were measured by means of infrared photodissociation spectroscopy and their structures were assigned by comparison to anharmonic vibrational spectra based on second&#8208;order perturbation theory.

         <title>Super&#8208;Robust Xanthine&#8211;Sodium Complexes on Au(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By mimicking the prebiotic submarine synthesis with a simplified model, i.e. reaction of xanthine and NaCl on Au(111), the necessity and appropriateness of high&#8208;temperature, Na&#8208;rich environment for the prebiotic biosynthesis is justified, by demonstrating that xanthine can form well&#8208;defined complexes with Na, but only at a temperature &#8805;430&#8197;K, and that the complexes are super&#8208;robust and remain adsorbed on Au(111) at a temperature as high as 720&#8197;K.







Abstract
A widely accepted theory is that life originated from the hydrothermal environment in the primordial ocean. Nevertheless, the low desorption temperature from inorganic substrates and the fragileness of hydrogen&#8208;bonded nucleobases do not support the required thermal stability in such an environment. Herein, we report the super&#8208;robust complexes of xanthine, one of the precursors for the primitive nucleic acids, with Na. We demonstrate that the well&#8208;defined xanthine&#8211;Na complexes can only form when the temperature is &#8805;430&#8197;K, and the complexes keep adsorbed even at &#8776;720&#8197;K, presenting as the most thermally stable organic polymer ever reported on Au(111). This work not only justifies the necessity of high&#8208;temperature, Na&#8208;rich environment for the prebiotic biosynthesis but also reveals the robustness of the xanthine&#8211;Na complexes upon the harsh environment. Moreover, the complexes can induce significant electron transfer with the metal as inert as Au and hence lift the Au atoms up.

         <title>Accelerating the Crystallization of Zeolite SSZ&#8208;13 with Polyamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy is presented to modulate the rate of zeolite SSZ&#8208;13 nucleation by regulating the evolution and colloidal stability of amorphous precursors using a small concentration of polymer additives, thus improving the overall efficiency of zeolite synthesis.







Abstract
Tailoring processes of nucleation and growth to achieve desired material properties is a pervasive challenge in synthetic crystallization. In systems where crystals form via nonclassical pathways, engineering materials often requires the controlled assembly and structural evolution of colloidal precursors. In this study, we examine zeolite SSZ&#8208;13 crystallization and show that several polyquaternary amines function as efficient accelerants of nucleation, and, in selected cases, tune crystal size by orders of magnitude. Among the additives tested, polydiallyldimethylammonium (PDDA) was found to have the most pronounced impact on the kinetics of SSZ&#8208;13 formation, leading to a 4&#8208;fold reduction in crystallization time. Our findings also reveal that enhanced nucleation occurs at an optimal PDDA concentration where a combination of light&#8208;scattering techniques demonstrate these conditions lead to polymer&#8208;induced aggregation of amorphous precursors and the promotion of (alumino)silicate precipitation from the growth solution. Here, we show that relatively low concentrations of polymer additives can be used in unique ways to dramatically enhance SSZ&#8208;13 crystallization rates, thereby improving the overall efficiency of zeolite synthesis.

         <dc:description>
A highly efficient atroposelective synthesis of axially chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bipyrroles bearing an N&#8722;N linkage from simple hydrazine and 1,4&#8208;diones is presented. Further product derivatizations led to axially chiral bifunctional compounds with high potential in asymmetric catalysis. For this chiral phosphoric acid (CPA)&#8208;catalyzed double Paal&#8211;Knorr reaction, an intriguing Fe(OTf)3&#8208;induced enantiodivergence was also observed.

         <title>Static Scanning Tunneling Microscopy Images Reveal the Mechanism of Supramolecular Polymerization of an Oligopyridine on Graphite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To be or not to be: The pressing question of the fundamental mechanism of two&#8208;dimensional self&#8208;assembly processes, namely that of thermodynamic or kinetic control, is demonstrated using the example of a donor&#8211;acceptor oligopyridine on graphite. A statistical analysis of STM images and DFT calculations suggest that there is a significant contribution of kinetics similar to copolymerization in bulk.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymerization of a donor&#8211;acceptor bisterpyridine (BTP) equipped with an electron&#8208;rich carbazole unit is observed by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) at the highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG)|solution interface. It is shown that two&#8208;dimensional crystals of supramolecular (co)polymers are formed by chain growth polymerization, which in turn can be described by copolymerization statistics. From concentration&#8208;dependent measurements, derived copolymerization parameters and DFT calculations, a mechanism for self&#8208;assembly is developed that suggests a kinetically driven polymerization process in combination with thermodynamically controlled crystallization.

         <title>Hierarchical Assembly of Coordination Macromolecules with Atypical Geometries: Gd44Co28 Crown and Gd95Co60 Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using a library containing multiple low&#8208;nuclearity units that have compatible geometry but incompatible symmetry, rare Ln&#8722;Co giant clusters with atypical geometry and assembly levels were achieved.







Abstract
The discovered giant clusters are always highly symmetric owing to the spontaneous assembly of one or two basic units. Herein we report the Gd44Co28 crown and Gd95Co60 cage, formulated as [Gd44Co28(IDA)20 (OH)72(CO3)12(OAc)28(H2O)64]&#8901;(ClO4)24 and [Na4Gd95 Co60(IDA)40(OH)150(CO3)40(OAc)58(H2O)164]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(ClO4)41 (H2IDA=iminodiacetic acid), respectively, by providing a library containing multiple low&#8208;nuclearity units. The heart&#8208;like units and crown&#8208;like tetramer found in both compounds indicate unprecedented assembly levels, leading to an atypical geometry characteristic compared to the giant clusters directly assembled by regular units. These two clusters not only significantly increase the size of Ln&#8722;Co clusters but also exhibit the enhanced magnetic entropy change at ultra&#8208;low temperatures. This work provided an effective way to fabricate cluster compounds with giant size and geometry complexity simultaneously.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bioinspired total synthesis of (+)&#8208;euphorikanin A, an intriguing and complex diterpenoid, was achieved by using an intramolecular nucleophile&#8208;catalyzed aldol lactonization of carboxylic acid&#8211;ketone to assemble the five&#8208;membered ring, a McMurry coupling to construct the seven&#8208;membered ring, and a biomimetic benzilic acid type rearrangement to form the bridged [3.2.1]&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactone moiety.

         <title>Oriented Nanoarchitectonics of Bacteriorhodopsin for Enhancing ATP Generation in a FoF1&#8208;ATPase&#8208;Based Assembly System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coassembly of bacteriorhodopsin (BR) and ATP synthase into an artificial biomimetic system has enabled a cascade reaction under illumination and the synthesis of ATP. The approach based on layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer electrostatic adsorption results in BR maintaining a highly uniform orientation with a high loading capacity and enhanced phosphorylation. The introduction of optically matched quantum dots led to the ATP production being further enhanced to 2.11 times.







Abstract
Energy conversion plays an important role in the metabolism of photosynthetic organisms. Improving energy transformation by promoting a proton gradient has been a great challenge for a long time. In the present study, we realize a directional proton migration through the construction of oriented bacteriorhodopsin (BR) microcapsules coated by FoF1&#8208;ATPase molecular motors through layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) assembly. The changes in the conformation of BR under illumination lead to proton transfer in a radial direction, which generates a higher proton gradient to drive the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by FoF1&#8208;ATPase. Furthermore, to promote the photosynthetic activity, optically matched quantum dots were introduced into the artificial coassembly system of BR and FoF1&#8208;ATPase. Such a design creates a new path for the use of light energy.

The changes in the conformation of BR under illumination lead to proton transfer in a radial direction, which generates a higher proton gradient to drive the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by F&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-ATPase. Furthermore, to promote the photosynthetic activity, optically matched quantum dots were introduced into the artificial coassembly system of BR and F&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-ATPase. Such a design creates a new path for the use of light energy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of a &#960;&#8208;Extended Azacorannulenophane Enabled by Strain&#8208;Induced 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#960;&#8208;extended azacorannulenophane, an [n]cyclophane molecule bearing the largest polycyclic heteroarene, was synthesized via a strain&#8208;induced 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition and subsequent palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclization. The obtained azacorannulenophane shows unique structural and physical features, which provides important insights into the influence of &#960;&#8208;extension and strain from an aliphatic chain in polycyclic aromatic systems.







Abstract
The first example of a cyclophane bearing a nitrogen&#8208;containing buckybowl was synthesized via sequential 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition and palladium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cyclization. The key to the successful synthesis is the strain&#8208;induced 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of a polycyclic aromatic azomethine ylide to the K&#8208;region of [7](2,7)pyrenophane. The resulting &#960;&#8208;extended azacorannulenophane exhibits intriguing structural and physical properties, including unique variation of bowl depth, extraordinarily high&#8208;field chemical shifts in its 1H&#8197;NMR spectrum, a decreased HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, and a red shift in the absorption/emission spectrum, when compared to those of the parent azacorannulene. These characteristics are derived from both the &#960;&#8208;extension to the polycyclic aromatic system in the cyclophane structure and the increased curvature enforced by the seven&#8208;carbon aliphatic chain.

         <title>Regulating the Tip Effect on Single&#8208;Atom and Cluster Catalysts: Forming Reversible Oxygen Species with High Efficiency in Chlorine Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tip effect (TE) has not been mentioned enough in catalysts designing, having a large space to explore. Based on the model of oxidized sub&#8208;nano clusters, the TE was regulated and found to be efficient in designing catalysts, making TiC perform a high activity during the chlor&#8208;alkali industry. This cluster system exhibits great potential in applying in the practical production and the comprehension of the TE is also pushed to a higher level.







Abstract
Chlorine evolution reaction has been applied in the production since a century ago. After times of evolution, it has been widely realized by the electrocatalytic process on anode nowadays. However, the anode applied in production contains a large amount of precious metal, increasing the cost. It is thus an opportunity to apply sub&#8208;nano catalysts in this field. By regulating the tip effect (TE) of the catalyst, it was discovered that the oxidized sub&#8208;nano iridium clusters supported by titanium carbide exhibit much higher efficiency than the single&#8208;atom one, which demonstrates the significance of modifying the electronic interaction. Moreover, it exhibits a &#8776;20&#8201;% decrease of the electricity, &#8776;98&#8201;% selectivity towards chlorine evolution reaction, and high durability of over 350&#8197;h. Therefore, this cluster catalyst performs great potential in applying in the practical production and the comprehension of the tip effect on different types of catalysts is also pushed to a higher level.

         <title>Site&#8208;Directed Chemical Modification of Amyloid by Polyoxometalates for Inhibition of Protein Misfolding and Aggregation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thiazolidinethione (TZ) modified Wells&#8211;Dawson polyoxometalate (POMD) derivative (POMD&#8208;TZ) has been synthesized which can covalently modify &#946;&#8208;amyloid peptide (A&#946;) site&#8208;selectively at Lys16. The inhibitory effect of POMD&#8208;TZ on A&#946; aggregation is much stronger than that of POMD, thus demonstrating the superiority of the chemical post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) method for the modification of traditional A&#946; inhibitors.







Abstract
Post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) of protein can significantly change protein conformation and function. Inspired by the natural PTM, we present a new approach to inhibit amyloid aggregation by chemical PTM modification. Polyoxometalates (POMs) were used as examples of inhibitors of &#946;&#8208;amyloid peptide (A&#946;) aggregation to illustrate the chemical PTM method. After the POMs were modified with thiazolidinethione (TZ), the resulting POMD&#8208;TZ acted as a chemical PTM agent and could covalently modify A&#946; site&#8208;selectively at Lys16. Multiple biophysical techniques and biochemical assays have been employed to show the superiority of the chemical PTM method compared to traditional A&#946; inhibitors. Since A&#946; oligomers are more cytotoxic, we further functionalized POMD&#8208;TZ with an A&#946;&#8208;targeted peptide and a fluorescent probe to obtain an &#8220;A&#946; oligomer sensitive&#8221; probe. The use of PTM agents for the site&#8208;directed chemical modification of proteins provides a new way to regulate amyloid aggregation.

         <title>Potassium Aluminyl Promoted Carbonylation of Ethene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;promoted carbonylation of alkenes is established for d&#8208;block metals, whilst prior work with aluminium has been limited by reversible C=C coordination and decomposition of CO insertion products. This work shows how the aluminyl anion allows the non&#8208;reversible carbonylation of ethene using carbon monoxide under mild conditions. A bimetallic pathway involving an intramolecular 1,2&#8208;hydrogen shift was identified and supported by DFT calculations.







Abstract
The potassium aluminyl [K{Al(NONDipp)}]2 ([NONDipp]2&#8722;=[O{SiMe2NDipp}2]2&#8722;, Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) activates ethene towards carbonylation with CO under mild conditions. An isolated bis&#8208;aluminacyclopropane compound reacted with CO via carbonylation of an Al&#8722;C bond, followed by an intramolecular hydrogen shift to form K2[Al(NONDipp)(&#956;&#8208;CH2CH=CO&#8208;1&#954;2C1,3&#8208;2&#954;O)Al(NONDipp)Et]. Restricting the chemistry to a mono&#8208;aluminium system allowed isolation of [Al(NONDipp)(CH2CH2CO&#8208;&#954;2C1,3)]&#8722;, which undergoes thermal isomerisation to form the [Al(NONDipp)(CH2CH=CHO&#8208;&#954;2C,O)]&#8722; anion. DFT calculations highlight the stabilising influence of incorporated benzene at multiple steps in the reaction pathways.

         <title>Wrinkled Titanium Carbide (MXene) with Surface Charge Polarizations through Chemical Etching for Superior Electromagnetic Interference Shielding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superb shielding effectiveness (107&#8197;dB at a thickness of 20&#8197;&#956;m) has been achieved in wrinkled MXene films. Such an enhancement is ascribed to the introduction of the absorption of electromagnetic waves by electric dipoles which is induced by the asymmetric distribution of charge density near Ti vacancies. These results offer a promising approach to regulate the electromagnetic interference shielding performance of two&#8208;dimensional materials.







Abstract
Despite the fact that the high conductivity of two&#8208;dimensional laminated transition metal carbides/nitrides (MXenes) contributes to the outstanding electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding by the reflection of electromagnetic waves (EWs), it is difficulty to improve EMI shielding by pursuing higher conductivity due to the limitation of intrinsic properties. Here, we achieve superior EMI shielding by introducing the absorption of EWs in MXenes with micro&#8208;sized wrinkles which are induced by abundant Ti vacancies under chemical etching. The shielding effectiveness is up to 107&#8197;dB at a thickness of 20&#8197;&#956;m. Combining with atomic&#8208;scale structure observation and the first&#8208;principles calculations, it is concluded that the promotion of EMI shielding originates from the resonant absorption of formed electric dipoles induced by the asymmetrical distribution of charge densities near Ti vacancies. Our results could open a new vista for developing two&#8208;dimensional EMI shielding materials.

         <title>Single Cell Imaging of Electrochemiluminescence&#8208;Driven Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A system for photodynamic therapy driven by electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is reported. The ECL generated by the Ru(bpy)32+/TPA pair acts as both the optical readout for the monitoring of the dynamic cellular processes and the light source for the excitation of a photosensitizer to produce cytotoxic ROS.







Abstract
We report a photodynamic therapy driven by electrochemiluminescence (ECL). The luminescence generated by Ru(bpy)32+ and co&#8208;reactant tripropylamine (TPA) pair acts as both optical readout for ECL imaging, and light source for the excitation of photosensitizer to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in photodynamic therapy (PDT) system. The ECL&#8208;driven PDT (ECL&#8208;PDT) relies on the effective energy transfer from ECL emission to photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6), which sensitizes the surrounding O2 into ROS. The dynamic process of gradual morphological changes, the variation of cell&#8208;matrix adhesions, as well as the increase of cell membrane permeability in the process of ECL&#8208;PDT were monitored under ECL microscopy (ECLM) with good spatiotemporal resolution. Combining real&#8208;time imaging with ECL&#8208;PDT, this new strategy provides not only new insights into dynamic cellular processes, but also promising potential of ECL in clinical applications.

         <title>CO2&#8208;Induced Exposure of the Intrinsic Magnetic Surface of BaTiO3 to Give Room&#8208;Temperature Ferromagnetism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;dimensional defect structure of BaTiO3 with exposed intrinsic face of (1
0) has been prepared using supercritical CO2. It displays room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism as demonstrated experimentally and theoretically.







Abstract
Preparation of low&#8208;dimensional ferromagnetic nanomaterials and investigation of their magnetic origin is critical to the exploration of novel materials with various applications such as data storage. Herein, non&#8208;van der Waals (non&#8208;vdW) BaTiO3 was successfully stripped to a low&#8208;dimensional structure by treating the materials with supercritical CO2 (SC CO2). Under different CO2 pressures, SC CO2 selectively cleaves the covalent bonds of the bulk BaTiO3, leading to the exposure of various surfaces. After SC CO2 treatments, the BaTiO3 exhibits room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism, which is significantly stronger than conventional treatments. According to the experimental and theoretical investigations, the enhanced ferromagnetic property is attributed to the exposure of the intrinsic surfaces of BaTiO3.

         <dc:description>
A synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;10&#8208;hydroxyacutuminine is reported. The strategy features an intramolecular, photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition to build the propellane core followed by a retro&#8208;aldol/Dieckmann sequence to form the requisite spirocyclic cyclopentenone.







Abstract
An enantioselective synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;10&#8208;hydroxyacutuminine is reported. Central to our strategy is a photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition that forges two of the quaternary stereocenters present in the acutumine alkaloids. A subsequent retro&#8208;aldol/Dieckmann sequence furnishes the spirocyclic cyclopentenone. Efforts to chlorinate the acutumine scaffold at C10 under heterolytic or radical deoxychlorination conditions led to the synthesis of an unexpected cyclopropane&#8208;containing pentacycle.

         <title>Exploring Unconventional SAM Analogues To Build Cell&#8208;Potent Bisubstrate Inhibitors for Nicotinamide N&#8208;Methyltransferase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first cell&#8208;potent and selective nicotinamide N&#8208;methyltransferase (NNMT) bisubstrate inhibitor, II399, was discovered by structure&#8208;based optimization by introducing unconventional S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine (SAM) mimics. The inhibition mechanism studies and crystal structure of the NNMT&#8211;II399 complex confirm its engagement with both SAM and substrate binding sites. II399 potently inhibits the methyltransferase activity of NNMT in cells.







Abstract
Nicotinamide N&#8208;methyltransferase (NNMT) methylates nicotinamide and has been associated with various diseases. Herein, we report the first cell&#8208;potent NNMT bisubstrate inhibitor II399, demonstrating a Ki of 5.9&#8197;nM in a biochemical assay and a cellular IC50 value of 1.9&#8197;&#956;M. The inhibition mechanism and cocrystal structure confirmed II399 engages both the substrate and cofactor binding pockets. Computational modeling and binding data reveal a balancing act between enthalpic and entropic components that lead to II399&#8242;s low nM binding affinity. Notably, II399 is 1&#8201;000&#8208;fold more selective for NNMT than closely related methyltransferases. We expect that II399 would serve as a valuable probe to elucidate NNMT biology. Furthermore, this strategy provides the first case of introducing unconventional SAM mimics, which can be adopted to develop cell&#8208;potent inhibitors for other SAM&#8208;dependent methyltransferases.

         <title>The Electronic Origin of Far&#8208;Red&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Oxygenic Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Differential protein electrostatics enable excitation of the Photosystem&#8208;II reaction center chlorophyll&#8211;pheophytin pigment pairs by far&#8208;red light along two distinct, conformation&#8208; and wavelength&#8208;dependent charge&#8208;transfer pathways.







Abstract
Photosystem&#8208;II uses sunlight to trigger charge separation and catalyze water oxidation. Intrinsic properties of chlorophyll a pigments define a natural &#8220;red limit&#8221; of photosynthesis at &#8776;680&#8197;nm. Nevertheless, charge separation can be triggered with far&#8208;red photons up to 800&#8197;nm, without altering the nature of light&#8208;harvesting pigments. Here we identify the electronic origin of this remarkable phenomenon using quantum chemical and multiscale simulations on a native Photosystem&#8208;II model. We find that the reaction center is preorganized for charge separation in the far&#8208;red region by specific chlorophyll&#8211;pheophytin pairs, potentially bypassing the light&#8208;harvesting apparatus. Charge transfer can occur along two distinct pathways with one and the same pheophytin acceptor (PheoD1). The identity of the donor chlorophyll (ChlD1 or PD1) is wavelength&#8208;dependent and conformational dynamics broaden the sampling of the far&#8208;red region by the two charge&#8208;transfer states. The two pathways rationalize spectroscopic observations and underpin designed extensions of the photosynthetically active radiation limit.

         <title>Reversing A Platinum Micromotor by Introducing Platinum Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding and controlling the swimming direction of a synthetic nano&#8208; and micromotor holds fundamental and applied significance. Here, we focus on platinum&#8208;containing Janus colloids that catalytically decomposes H2O2 into O2, an archetypical model of chemical micromotor. We discover that platinum oxides (primarily PtO) is produced on Pt films sputter&#8208;coated in O2 plasma, and PtO reverses the motor possibly by self&#8208;electrophoresis. Using this knowledge, micromotors moving in either direction was fabricated by intentionally introducing or removing PtO. These findings challenge the conventional wisdom that a Pt micromotor is powered by Pt alone, and open up new avenues for controlling the swimming directions of a micro&#8208; and nanomachine.</dc:description>

         <title>Fusion of Multi&#8208;Resonance Fragment with Conventional Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon for Nearly BT2020 Green Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a general strategy for achieving ultra&#8208;pure green emissions by suppressing the shoulder peaks in the emission spectra of conventional polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Through precise synthetic fusion of multi&#8208;resonance (MR) fragments with conventional PAH, extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation lengths, increased molecular rigidity, and reduced vibrational frequency could be simultaneously realized. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept emitters exhibited ultra&#8208;pure green emissions with dominant peaks at ca. 521 nm, photoluminescence quantum yields that are greater than 99%, a small full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum of 23 nm, and CIE coordinates of (0.16, 0.77). The bottom&#8208;emitting organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) exhibited a record&#8208;high CIE  y  value of 0.74 and a high maximum external quantum efficiency of 30.5%. The top&#8208;emitting OLED not only achieved a BT.2020 green color (CIE: 0.17, 0.78) for the first time but also showed superior performance among all green OLED devices, with a current efficiency of 220 cd A  &#8208;1  .</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Alkylation of (Hetero)Arenes with Styrenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient and general intermolecular Cobalt(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric alkylation of styrenes with (hetero)arenes including indoles, thiophene and electron rich arenes has been developed, providing straightforward access to enantioenriched alkyl(hetero)arenes with high enantioselectivity. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction underwent a CoH&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) with alkenes, followed by a pivotal catalyst&#8208;controlled S  N  2&#8208;like pathway between  in situ  generated organocobalt(IV) species and aromatic nucleophiles. This is the first CoH&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrofunctionalization using carbon nucleophiles, providing a new strategy for asymmetric Friedel&#8208;Crafts type alkylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Tuning in Reaction&#8208;based Fluorescent Sensing for Instantaneous and Ultrasensitive Visualization of Ethylenediamine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manipulation from multi&#8208;physical quantity aspect to steer molecular photophysical property is of great significance in improving sensing performance. Here, an investigation on how physical quantity rooted from molecular structure induce optical behavior change to facilitate an ultrasensitive detection to ethylenediamine (EDA) is performed by varying a set of thiols. The model molecule consisted of a thiol with dual&#8208;carboxyl exhibits the strongest fluorescence ascribed to the electron&#8208;donating ability prompted larger orbital overlapping and oscillator strength. The elevated fluorescence positively corelated to the increased EDA, endowing an ultrasensitive response to nanomolar&#8208;liquid/ppm&#8208;vapor. A gas detector with superior performances fulfills a contactless and real&#8208;time management to EDA. We envisage this electron tuning strategy enabled fluorescence enhancement can offer an in&#8208;depth insight in advancing molecule customized design, further paving the way to widen applicable scenes.</dc:description>

A gas detector with superior performances fulfills a contactless and real-time management to EDA. We envisage this electron tuning strategy enabled fluorescence enhancement can offer an in-depth insight in advancing molecule customized design, further paving the way to widen applicable scenes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Realizing the 1,1&#8208;Dehydration of Secondary Alcohols to Carbenes: Pyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ols as a Source of Cyclic (Alkyl)(Amino)Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report secondary pyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ols as a source of cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAAC) for the synthesis of CAAC&#8208;Cu(I)&#8208;complexes and cyclic thiones when reacted with Cu(I)&#8208;salts and elemental sulfur, respectively, under reductive elimination of water from the carbon(IV)&#8208;center. This result demonstrates a convenient and facile access to CAAC&#8208;based Cu(I)&#8208;salts, which are well known catalysts for different organic transformations. It further establishes secondary alcohols to be a viable source of carbenes &#8211; realizing after 185 years Dumas&#8217; dream who tried to prepare  the  parent carbene (CH  2  ) by 1,1&#8208;dehydration of methanol. Addressed is also the reactivity of water towards CAACs, which proceeds through an oxidative addition of the O&#8208;H bond to the carbon(II)&#8208;center. This emphasizes the ability of carbon&#8208;compounds to mimic the reactivity of transition&#8208;metal complexes: reversible oxidative addition and reductive elimination of the O&#8208;H bond to/from the C(II)/C(IV)&#8208;centre.</dc:description>

         <title>An Anionic Dinuclear Ruthenium Dihydrogen Complex of Relevance for Alkyne gem&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>During an investigation into the fate of ruthenium precatalysts used for light&#8208;driven alkyne gem&#8208;hydrogenation reactions with formation of Grubbs&#8208;type ruthenium catalysts, it was found that the reaction of [(IPr)(&#951;6&#8208;cymene)RuCl2] with H2 under UV&#8208;irradiation affords an anionic dinuclear &#963;&#8208;dihydrogen complex, which is thermally surprisingly robust. Not only are anionic &#963;&#8208;complexes in general exceedingly rare, but the newly formed species seems to be the first example lacking any structural attributes able to counterbalance the negative charge and, in so doing, prevent oxidative insertion of the metal centers into the ligated H2 from occurring.</dc:description>

         <title>Tandem Catalysis for Selective Oxidation of Methane to Oxygenates Using Oxygen over PdCu/Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective oxidation of methane to oxygenates with O  2  under mild conditions remains a great challenge. Here we report a ZSM&#8208;5 (Z&#8208;5) supported PdCu bimetallic catalyst (PdCu/Z&#8208;5) for methane conversion to oxygenates by reacting with O  2  in the presence of H  2  at low temperature (120 &#176;C). Benefiting from the co&#8208;existence of PdO nanoparticles and Cu single atoms via tandem catalysis, the PdCu/Z&#8208;5 catalyst exhibited high oxygenates yield of 1178 mmol/g  Pd  /h (mmol of oxygenates per gram Pd per hour) and at the same time high oxygenates selectivity of up to 95%. Control experiments and mechanistic studies revealed that PdO nanoparticles promoted the in situ generation of H  2  O  2  from O  2  and H  2  , while Cu single atoms not only accelerated the activation of H  2  O  2  for the generation of abundant hydroxyl radicals (&#183;OH) from H  2  O  2  decomposition, but also enabled the homolytic cleavage of CH  4  by &#183;OH to methyl radicals (&#183;CH  3  ). Subsequently, the &#183;OH reacted quickly with the &#183;CH  3  to form CH  3  OH with high selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Recycling of Catalyst&#8211;Solvent Couples from Lewis Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Reactions in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of bioinspired supramolecule architectures allowed us to compartmentalize highly charged aqua scandium ions into chiral hydrophobic scaffolds, thereby enabling efficient recyclability of solvent&#8211;catalyst couples. The recycling without significant loss in catalytic performance has been considered a formidable task, especially for Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed reactions using basic substrates. This is because Lewis basic impurities derived from starting materials, products, and water are highly competitive ligands for both substrate binding and metal complexation, poisoning the Lewis acids and leading to their leaching. Notwithstanding the use of basic aniline, the optimal architecture allowed for effective suppression of Sc  3+  leaching and for reuse of both water and catalyst without mortiferous deactivation in asymmetric ring&#8208;opening reactions of  meso  &#8208;epoxides. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application to asymmetric thia&#8208;Michael addition and asymmetric hydroxymethylation was also demonstrated. The successful recycling in these reactions in highly Lewis basic environments underpin the exceptionally high robustness of the chiral Lewis acid catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Reaction Rate Acceleration of Cooperative Catalytic Systems: Metal Nanoparticles and Lewis Acids in Arene Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Employing two distinct catalysts in one reaction medium synergistically is a powerful strategy for activating less reactive substrates. Although the approach has been well&#8208;developed in homogeneous conditions, it remains challenging and rare in heterogeneous catalysis, especially under gas&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid multiphase reaction conditions. Here, we describe the development of cooperative and synergistic catalyst systems of heterogeneous Rh&#8211;Pt bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts, Rh&#8211;Pt/DMPSi&#8211;Al2O3, and Sc(OTf)3 in the liquid phase for the hydrogenation of arenes under very mild conditions. Dramatic rate acceleration was achieved with cooperative activation. Remarkably, more challenging substrates that contained strong electron&#8208;donating groups and sterically hindered substituents were smoothly hydrogenated. Mechanistic insights into the cooperative activation of an aromatic substrate by heterogeneous metal nanoparticles and a soluble Lewis acid was obtained by kinetic studies and by direct observation of 1H and 45Sc NMR spectra.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poor oxygen diffusion at multiphase interfaces in air cathode suppresses the energy densities of zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). Developing effective strategies to tackle the issue is of great significance for overcoming the performance bottleneck. Herein, inspired by the bionics of diving flies, a polytetrafluoroethylene layer was coated on the surfaces of Co3O4 nanosheets (NSs) grown on carbon cloth (CC) to create a hydrophobic surface to enable the formation of more three&#8208;phase reaction interfaces and promoted oxygen diffusion, rendering the hydrophobic&#8208;Co3O4 NSs/CC electrode a higher limiting current density (214 mA cm&#8210;2 at 0.3 V) than that (10 mA cm&#8210;2) of untreated&#8208;Co3O4 NSs/CC electrode. Consequently, the assembled ZAB employing hydrophobic&#8208;Co3O4 NSs/CC cathode acquired a higher power density (171 mW cm&#8210;2) than that (102 mW cm&#8210;2) utilizing untreated&#8208;Co3O4 NSs/CC cathode, proving the enhanced interfacial reaction kinetics on air cathode benefiting from the hydrophobization engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Chirality of Perylene Diimides: Design Strategies and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality is a particularly important concept in nature and exists at all length scales, ranging from the molecular level to the supramolecular level. Over the last two decades, various design strategies have been developed to construct perylene diimide (PDI) based chiral materials and to mimic the chiral assembly process in biological systems, but applications of these chiral aggregates are still at an early stage. This minireview summarizes recent progress in the synthesis and properties of chiral PDIs. Three different approaches can be utilized to generate chirality in PDI based materials: the twisted planes of PDIs, the chiral substituents of PDIs, and the co&#8208;assembly of achiral PDIs and chiral guests. We also provide a comprehensive understanding of the applications of chiral PDIs as well as potential future developments.</dc:description>
