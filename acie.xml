         <title>Template Guided Regioselective Encaging of Platinum Single Atoms into Y Zeolite: Enhanced Selectivity in Semihydrogenation and Resistance to Poisoning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is challenging to localize single metal atoms at target sites of zeolite with uniform coordination environment. In this study, single platinum atoms were selectively encaged into six&#8208;membered rings of sodalite (SOD) cages within Y zeolite through a template guiding strategy, in which, during in situ synthesis process, template molecules were designed to occupy supercages, thus to enforce coordinated platinum species involved into SOD cages, and then, followed by control of post&#8208;treatment condition to obtain this Y zeolite selectively encaged single platinum atoms catalyst (denoted as Pt@Y&#8208;SOD). In addition to show good stability and excellent catalytic selectivity in semihydrogenation reaction, Pt@Y&#8208;SOD catalyst also exhibited interesting thiophene&#8208;resistance and carbon monoxide&#8208;resistance abilities in this transformation, as a result of the unique configuration of encaged single platinum atoms to weaken the interactions with these poisons.</dc:description>

         <title>Working Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries at 80oC</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8211;air batteries possess inherent safety and are especially commendable facing high&#8208;temperature working conditions. However, their working feasibility at high temperatures has seldom been investigated. Herein, the working feasibility of high&#8208;temperature zinc&#8211;air batteries is systemically investigated. The effects of temperature on air cathode, zinc anode, and aqueous electrolyte are decoupled to identify the favorable and unfavorable factors. Specifically, parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction strengthens at high temperatures and leads to declined anode Faraday efficiency, which is identified as the main bottleneck. Moreover, zinc&#8211;air batteries demonstrate cycling feasibility at 80  o  C. This work reveals the potential of zinc&#8211;air batteries to satisfy energy storage at high temperatures and guides further development of advanced batteries towards harsh working conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemically Tuning Attractive and Repulsive Interactions between Solubilizing Oil Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Micellar solubilization is a transport process occurring in surfactant&#8208;stabilized emulsions that can lead to Marangoni flow and droplet motility. Active droplets exhibit self&#8208;propulsion and pairwise repulsion due to solubilization processes and/or solubilization products raising the droplet&#8217;s interfacial tension. Here, we report emulsions with the opposite behavior, wherein solubilization decreases the interfacial tension and causes droplets to attract. We characterize the influence of oil chemical structure, nonionic surfactant structure, and surfactant concentration on the interfacial tensions and Marangoni flows of solubilizing oil&#8208;in&#8208;water drops. Three regimes corresponding to droplet &#8220;attraction&#8221;, &#8220;repulsion&#8221; or &#8220;inactivity&#8221; are identified. We believe these studies contribute to a fundamental understanding of solubilization processes in emulsions and provide guidance as to how chemical parameters can influence the dynamics and chemotactic interactions between active droplets.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Stable Metal&#8208;Free Long&#8208;Persistent Luminescent Copolymer for Low Flicker AC&#8208;LEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free nonconjugated long&#8208;persistent luminescent copolymer that exhibits excellent optical stability under high temperature and high humidity was designed and characterized. Long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) is clearly observed at 353&#8197;K and the copolymer can be excited by ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared irradiation. The high initial LPL intensity with an ultrafast filling time significantly reduces flicker in alternating current driven light&#8208;emitting diodes (AC&#8208;LEDs) to 63.3&#8201;%.







Abstract
Organic room&#8208;temperature long&#8208;persistent luminescent materials are promising light&#8208;emitting materials for encryption, architectural decoration, organic solar cells, and biomedical applications. However, their unstable structures and thermal&#8208; and humidity&#8208;induced emission quenching have greatly limited their utility and reliability. Here, we report a metal&#8208;free nonconjugated copolymer that possesses stable photoluminescence at both high temperature and humidity. The room&#8208;temperature long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) of this copolymer lasts for more than 15&#8197;s and can be recovered in high humidity conditions by heating to remove moisture. Copolymer LPL can be achieved with various excitation wavelengths, ranging from ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared, and the LPL color can be adjusted accordingly. The high initial LPL intensity and ultrafast filling time of the copolymer makes it suitable for low flicker alternating current&#8208;driven light&#8208;emitting diodes (AC&#8208;LEDs).

         <title>Molecular Inhibition for Selective CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO  2  reduction presents a sustainable route to the production of chemicals and fuels. Achieving a narrow product distribution with heterogeneous Cu catalysts is challenging and conventional material modifications offer limited control over selectivity. Here, we show that surface&#8208;immobilised molecular species can act as inhibitors for specific carbon products to provide rational control over product distributions. Combined experimental and computational results showed that anchoring of a thiol&#8209;functionalised pyridine on Cu destabilises a surface&#8209;bound reaction intermediate to energetically block a CO&#8209;producing pathway, thereby favouring formate production. The nitrogen atom was shown to be essential to the inhibition mechanism. The ability of molecules to control selectivity through inhibition of specific reaction pathways offers a unique approach to rationally modify heterogeneous catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Reverse Sequence Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a new aqueous polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) formulation that enables the hydrophobic block to be prepared first when targeting diblock copolymer nano&#8208;objects. This counter&#8208;intuitive reverse sequence approach uses an ionic RAFT agent for the RAFT aqueous dispersion polymerization of 2&#8208;hydroxypropyl methacrylate (HPMA) to produce charge&#8208;stabilized latex particles. Chain extension using a water&#8208;soluble methacrylic, acrylic or acrylamide comonomer then produces sterically&#8208;stabilized diblock copolymer nanoparticles in an aqueous one&#8208;pot formulation. In each case, the monomer diffuses into the PHPMA particles, which act as the locus for the polymerization. A remarkable change in morphology occurs as the ~600 nm latex is converted into much smaller sterically&#8208;stabilized diblock copolymer nanoparticles, which exhibit thermoresponsive behavior. Such reverse sequence PISA formulations enable the efficient synthesis of new functional diblock copolymer nanoparticles.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Insulator&#8211;Metal Transition by Chemical Doping and Dedoping of a Mott Insulator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemical carrier doping of molecular Mott insulators has been poorly investigated to date due to its difficulty. In this study, iodine doping of a molecular Mott insulator, lithium phthalocyanine crystallized in the x&#8208;form (x&#8208;LiPc), was performed to obtain metallic x&#8208;LiPcI. Crystal structure analysis revealed that iodine atoms penetrated channels of x&#8208;LiPc and formed one&#8208;dimensional chains. The Raman spectroscopy of x&#8208;LiPcI indicated the existence of linear&#160; I  5  &#8211;  , demonstrating a transition from a half&#8208;filled band of the Mott insulating state to a 2/5&#8208;filled band of the metallic state . Electrical resistivity measurements confirmed the metallic nature of x&#8208;LiPcI, whereas a thermally activated behavior was observed for pristine x&#8208;LiPc. Furthermore, the x&#8208;LiPc Mott insulator was reproduced by dedoping iodine from x&#8208;LiPcI, suggesting that the electronic state can be reversibly tuned between the Mott insulating and metallic states by chemical doping and dedoping.</dc:description>

         <title>The Synthetic Potential of Thiophenium Ylide Cycloadducts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>(3+2) cycloaddition reactions are undeniably one of the most robust and versatile synthetic tool in heterocyclic chemistry. The classically required 1,3&#8208;dipoles are however limited to three&#8208;atom sequences bearing stabilized formal charges in their Lewis structure. The scope of three&#8208;atom groupings possible in (3+2) cycloadditions can be greatly expanded by taking of advantage neutral three&#8208;atom components (TACs). These groupings result in zwitterionic (3+2) cycloadducts adaptable to multiple outcomes depending on structure and conditions. In this article, the intramolecular (3+2) cycloaddition reaction between alkynyl sulfides (neutral TAC) and alkynes to provide key thiophenium ylide intermediates is first reported. These reactive species provide access to highly substituted fused thiophenes following predictable chemical sequences. Structural features on the obtained thiophenes were highly configurable by judicious choice of both alkynyl sulfide substitution and reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Eu2P2S6: The First Rare&#8208;Earth Chalcogenophosphate Exhibiting Large Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation Response and High Laser&#8208;Induced Damage Threshold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal chalcogenophosphates are receiving increasing interest, specifically as promising infrared nonlinear optical (NLO) candidates. Here, a rare&#8208;earth chalcogenophosphate Eu2P2S6 crystallizing in the monoclinic noncentrosymmetric space group Pn was synthesized using a high&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state method. Its structure features isolated [P2S6]4&#8722; dimer, and two types of EuS8 bicapped triangular prisms. Eu2P2S6 exhibits a phase&#8208;matchable second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response ~0.9 &#215; AgGaS2@2.1 &#956;m, and high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold of 3.4 &#215; AgGaS2, representing the first rare&#8208;earth NLO chalcogenophosphate. The theoretical calculation result suggests that the SHG response is ascribed to the synergetic contribution of [P2S6]4&#8722; dimers and EuS8 bicapped triangular prisms. This work provides not only a promising high&#8208;performance infrared NLO material, but also open the avenue for exploring rare&#8208;earth chalcogenophosphates as potential IR NLO materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual honeycomb&#8208;superlattice enables double&#8208;high activity and reversibility of anion redox for sodium&#8208;ion battery layered cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anion redox contributes to the anomalous capacity exceeding theoretical limit of layered oxides. However, double&#8208;high activity and reversibility is challenging due to the structural rearrangement and potential oxygen loss. Here, we propose a strategy of constructing dual honeycomb&#8208;superlattice structure in Na  2/3  [Li  1/7  Mn  5/14  ][Mg  1/7  Mn  5/14  ]O  2  to simultaneously realize high activity and reversibility of lattice O redox. Theoretical simulation and electrochemical tests show that  [Li  1/7  Mn  5/14  ] superlattice units remarkably trigger the anion redox activity  and enable to deliver a record capacity of 285.9 mA g  &#8208;1  in layered sodium&#8208;ion battery cathodes. Nuclear magnetic resonance and  in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction reveal that [Mg  1/7  Mn  5/14  ] superlattice units are beneficial to the structure and anion redox reversibility  , where Li  +  reversibly shuttles between Na layers and transition&#8208;metal slabs  in contrast to the absence of [Mg  1/7  Mn  5/14  ]  units. Our findings underline the importance of multifunctional units and provide a path to advanced battery materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Nearly&#160;Unity Quantum Yield Persistent Room Temperature Phosphorescence from Heavy Atom&#8208;Free Rigid Inorganic/Organic Hybrid Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synergism between covalent and non&#8208;covalent bonds is employed to fix an organic phosphor guest in a rigid inorganic framework, simulating the stiffening effect seen in the glassy state and realizing efficient and ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (RTP). Twelve heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free composites have been obtained through introducing arylboric or arylcarboxylic acid derivatives into the inorganic boric acid matrix by solid&#8208;phase synthesis. Owing to the stiffening effect of multiple bonds, all the composites show highly&#8208;efficient and persistent RTP of guest molecules with quantum yield ranging from 39.8% to ca. 100% and lifetime up to 8.74 s, which results in a 55 s afterglow visible to naked eyes after exposure to a portable UV lamp. Interestingly, it is found that the substitution position and quantity of carboxyl in guest have a great influence on the phosphorescent properties, and that the heavy&#8208;atom effect is invalid in such host&#8208;guest hybrid systems. The 100 g grade composite is easily prepared because of the solvent&#8208;free, green, and simple synthesis method. These results provide an important way for the development of RTP materials with ultrahigh quantum yield and ultralong lifetime, as well as their practical applications in the fields of anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information storage, among others.</dc:description>

Owing to the stiffening effect of multiple bonds, all the composites show highly-efficient and persistent RTP of guest molecules with quantum yield ranging from 39.8% to ca. 100% and lifetime up to 8.74 s, which results in a 55 s afterglow visible to naked eyes after exposure to a portable UV lamp. Interestingly, it is found that the substitution position and quantity of carboxyl in guest have a great influence on the phosphorescent properties, and that the heavy-atom effect is invalid in such host-guest hybrid systems. The 100 g grade composite is easily prepared because of the solvent-free, green, and simple synthesis method. These results provide an important way for the development of RTP materials with ultrahigh quantum yield and ultralong lifetime, as well as their practical applications in the fields of anti-counterfeiting and information storage, among others.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoredox Generation of Isothiouronyl Radical Cations: A New Platform in Covalent Radical Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thiyl radicals offer unique catalytic patterns for the direct covalent activation of alkenes. However, important limitations in term of structural diversity and handling have hampered the routine use of thiyl radicals in covalent radical catalysis. Herein, we report a new class of cationic sulfur&#8208;centered radicals to achieve covalent radical catalysis. Their generation from highly modular thioureas by photoredox catalysis make their utilization very simple and reliable. The synthetic potential and the versatility of the catalytic system were finally evaluated in a (3+2)&#8208;radical cascade between vinylcyclopropanes and olefins.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>It is the most attractive strategy to develop chemically recyclable polymers to establish a circular plastic economy. Despite the recent advancements, the chemically recyclable polymers still face challenges including high energy cost for polymer preparation or recycling, poor monomer recovery selectivity and efficiency as well as undesired material performances.

The obtained polyester with high molar mass exhibits good tensile strength comparable to that of some commodity plastics. Remarkably, the obtained polyester can be depolymerized to recover pristine monomer with a 96% yield by thermolysis, thus successfully establishing a close&#8208;loop life cycle.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are promising platforms for heterogeneous tethering of molecular CO2 reduction electrocatalysts. Yet, to further understand electrocatalytic MOF systems, one also needs to consider their capability to fine&#8208;tune the immediate chemical environment of the active site, and thus affect its overall catalytic operation. here, we show that electrostatic secondary&#8208;sphere functionalities enable substantial improvement of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion activity and selectivity. In&#8208;situ Raman analysis reveal that immobilization of pendent positively&#8208;charged groups adjacent to MOF&#8208;residing Fe&#8208;porphyrin catalysts, stabilize weakly&#8208;bound CO intermediates, allowing their rapid release as catalytic products. Also, by varying the electrolyte&#8217;s ionic strength, systematic regulation of electrostatic field magnitude was achieved, resulting in essentially 100% CO selectivity. Thus, this concept provides a sensitive molecular&#8208;handle that adjust heterogenous electrocatalysis on demand.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescence or Phosphorescence? The Metallic Composition of the Nanocluster Kernel Does Matter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metallic compositions of nanoclusters can dictate whether their photoluminescence is fluorescence or phosphorescence. This effect is demonstrated with Au5Ag11 and Pt1Ag16 nanoclusters that have comparable structures but different compositions.







Abstract
It remains challenging to manipulate the nature of photoluminescence as either fluorescence or phosphorescence for a correlated cluster series. In this work, two correlated nanoclusters, Au5Ag11(SR)8(DPPOE)2 and Pt1Ag16(SR)8(DPPOE)2 with comparable structure features, were synthesized and structurally determined. These two alloy nanoclusters displayed distinct photoluminescent nature&#8212;the Au5Ag11 nanocluster is fluorescent, whereas the Pt1Ag16 nanocluster is phosphorescent. The decay processes of the excited electrons in these two nanoclusters have been explicitly mapped out by both experimental and theoretical approaches, disclosing the mechanisms of their fluorescence and phosphorescence. Specifically, the metallic compositions of the nanocluster kernels mattered in determining their photoluminescent nature. The results herein provide an intriguing nanomodel that enables us to grasp the origin of photoluminescence at the atomic level, which further paves the way for fabricating novel nanoclusters or cluster&#8208;based nanomaterials with customized photophysical properties.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Biocatalytic Synthesis of Sustainable Surfactants by Selective Amide Bond Formation
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzymatic route to commercially important surfactants is presented. A truncated construct of carboxylic acid reductase (CARmm&#8208;A) catalyzes amide bond formation between fatty acids and amino alcohols with no esterification observed. The wide substrate scope of the enzyme, co&#8208;factor recycling, reaction engineering and up&#8208;scaling show the feasibility of this method for synthesis.







Abstract
N&#8208;alkanoyl&#8208;N&#8208;methylglucamides (MEGAs) are non&#8208;toxic surfactants widely used as commercial ingredients, but more sustainable syntheses towards these compounds are highly desirable. Here, we present a biocatalytic route towards MEGAs and analogues using a truncated carboxylic acid reductase construct tailored for amide bond formation (CARmm&#8208;A). CARmm&#8208;A is capable of selective amide bond formation without the competing esterification reaction observed in lipase catalysed reactions. A kinase was implemented to regenerate ATP from polyphosphate and by thorough reaction optimisation using design of experiments, the amine concentration needed for amidation was significantly reduced. The wide substrate scope of CARmm&#8208;A was exemplified by the synthesis of 24 commercially relevant amides, including selected examples on a preparative scale. This work establishes acyl&#8208;phosphate mediated chemistry as a highly selective strategy for biocatalytic amide bond formation in the presence of multiple competing alcohol functionalities.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-alkanoyl-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methylglucamides (MEGAs) are non-toxic surfactants widely used as commercial ingredients, but more sustainable syntheses towards these compounds are highly desirable. Here, we present a biocatalytic route towards MEGAs and analogues using a truncated carboxylic acid reductase construct tailored for amide bond formation (CAR&lt;i&gt;mm&lt;/i&gt;-A). CAR&lt;i&gt;mm&lt;/i&gt;-A is capable of selective amide bond formation without the competing esterification reaction observed in lipase catalysed reactions. A kinase was implemented to regenerate ATP from polyphosphate and by thorough reaction optimisation using design of experiments, the amine concentration needed for amidation was significantly reduced. The wide substrate scope of CAR&lt;i&gt;mm&lt;/i&gt;-A was exemplified by the synthesis of 24 commercially relevant amides, including selected examples on a preparative scale. This work establishes acyl-phosphate mediated chemistry as a highly selective strategy for biocatalytic amide bond formation in the presence of multiple competing alcohol functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emitters Exhibiting Narrowband Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence with an EQE of 37.2&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of central chirality and multi&#8208;resonance framework derives a set of chiral enantiomers concurrently featuring narrowband emission and circularly polarized (CP) thermally activated delayed fluorescence. Owing to high rigidity and quasi&#8208;planarity of the skeleton, a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 96&#8201;%, a FWHM of 30&#8197;nm, as well as a high horizontal dipole orientation of 90&#8201;% are acquired in the doped film. Corresponding CP&#8208;OLEDs manifest a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency up to 37.2&#8201;% with low efficiency roll&#8208;off, and obvious circularly polarized electroluminescence.







Abstract
Highly efficient circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) emitters with narrowband emission remain a formidable challenge for circularly polarized OLEDs (CP&#8208;OLEDs). Here, a promising strategy for developing chiral emitters concurrently featuring multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) and circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) is demonstrated by the integration of molecular rigidity, central chirality and MR effect. A pair of chiral green emitters denoted as (R)&#8208;BN&#8208;MeIAc and (S)&#8208;BN&#8208;MeIAc is designed. Benefited by the rigid and quasi&#8208;planar MR&#8208;framework, the enantiomers not only display mirror&#8208;image CPL spectra, but also exhibit TADF properties with a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 96&#8201;%, a narrow FWHM of 30&#8197;nm, and a high horizontal dipole orientation of 90&#8201;% in the doped film. Consequently, the enantiomer&#8208;based CP&#8208;OLEDs achieved excellent external quantum efficiencies of 37.2&#8201;% with very low efficiency roll&#8208;off, representing the highest device efficiency of all the reported CP&#8208;OLEDs.

         <title>Red&#8208;Shifted Water&#8208;Soluble BODIPY Photocages for Visualisation and Controllable Cellular Delivery of Signaling Lipids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;soluble &#960;&#8208;extended BODIPY photocages are presented. They can selectively target inner or outer cell membranes and release signaling lipids upon red&#8208;light illumination, inducing Ca2+ signaling. The solvent&#8208;dependent uncaging mechanism and orthogonal uncaging in the presence of a coumarin&#8208;caged lipid is reported.







Abstract
In this work, we developed a water&#8208;soluble caging group based on a &#960;&#8208;extended BODIPY scaffold able to release carboxylate&#8208;containing cargo upon red light illumination (&#955;irr=633&#8197;nm). We performed mechanistic studies showing new insights into the principles of the photoreactivity of these cages and demonstrated a significant influence of the structure of a carboxylate cargo on the rate and efficiency of the uncaging process and its side reactions. We used it for selective delivery, visualisation, and photorelease of a signaling lipid in cell plasma and internal membranes. With this approach, we successfully induced Ca2+ release in cells expressing the GPR40 receptor.

         <title>The Intrinsic Role of the Fusion Mode and Electron&#8208;Deficient Core in Fused&#8208;Ring Electron Acceptors for Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The angular fusion mode and electron&#8208;deficient core have different effects in the A&#8208;DA&#8242;D&#8208;A acceptors. The angular fusion is beneficial to enhance light absorption and reduce electron&#8208;vibration couplings to simultaneously accelerate exciton diffusion, exciton dissociation, and electron transport, while introducing the electron&#8208;deficient core will lead to deeper frontier orbitals, bathochromic absorption, and further promote exciton dissociation.







Abstract
The A&#8208;DA&#8242;D&#8208;A fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors with an angular fusion mode and electron&#8208;deficient core has significantly boosted organic photovoltaic efficiency. Here, the intrinsic role of the peculiar structure is revealed by comparing representative A&#8208;DA&#8242;D&#8208;A acceptor Y6 with its A&#8208;D&#8208;A counterparts having different fusion modes. Owing to the more delocalized HOMO and deeper LUMO level, Y6 exhibits stronger and red&#8208;shifted absorption relative to the linear and angular fused A&#8208;D&#8208;A acceptors, respectively. Moreover, the change from linear to angular fusion substantially reduces the electron&#8208;vibration couplings, which is responsible for the faster exciton diffusion, exciton dissociation, and electron transport for Y6 than the linear fused A&#8208;D&#8208;A acceptor. Notably, the electron&#8208;vibration coupling for exciton dissociation is further decreased by introducing the electron&#8208;deficient core, thus contributing to the efficient charge generation under low driving forces in the Y6&#8208;based devices.

On&#8208;surface reactions of benzylic bromides on Au(111) towards dimerization or polymerization via selective dehalogenative C&#8722;C coupling have been investigated. The unambiguous formation of conjugated poly(o&#8208;naphthylene vinylene) and electronic structure after thermal induced dehydrogenation have been revealed.







Abstract
We describe the on&#8208;surface dehalogenative homocoupling of benzylic bromides, namely bis&#8208;bromomethyl&#8208; and bis&#8208;gem&#8208;(dibromomethyl) naphthalene as a potential route to either hydrocarbon dimers or conjugated polymers on Au(111). While bis&#8208;gem&#8208;(dibromomethyl) naphthalene affords different dimers with naphthocyclobutadiene as the key intermediate, bis&#8208;bromomethyl naphthalene furnishes a poly(o&#8208;naphthylene vinylidene) as a non&#8208;conjugated polymer which undergoes dehydrogenation toward its conjugated derivative poly(o&#8208;naphthylene vinylene) upon mild annealing. A combination of scanning tunneling microscopy, non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy and density functional theory calculations provides deep insights into the prevailing mechanisms.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled NiH&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Chain&#8208;Walking Hydroalkylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ligand&#8208;controlled NiH&#8208;catalyzed migratory hydroalkylation of unactivated alkenes with the assistance of a simple amide directing group is developed. A range of structurally diverse &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;branched protected amines are conveniently synthesized via stabilization of 5 and 6&#8208;membered nickelacycles respectively.







Abstract
A NiH&#8208;catalyzed migratory hydroalkylation of alkenyl amines with predictable and switchable regioselectivity is reported. By utilizing a ligand&#8208;controlled, directing group&#8208;assisted strategy, various alkyl units are site&#8208;selectively installed at inert sp3 C&#8722;H sites far away from the original C=C bonds. A range of structurally diverse &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;branched protected amines are conveniently synthesized via stabilization of 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered nickelacycles respectively. This method exhibits broad scope and high functional group tolerance, and can be applied to late&#8208;stage modification of medicinally relevant molecules.

         <title>Boosting Near&#8208;Infrared Luminescence of Lanthanide in Cs2AgBiCl6 Double Perovskites via Breakdown of the Local Site Symmetry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of NIR&#8208;emitting lanthanide&#8208;doped double perovskites (DPs) of Cs2(Na/Ag)BiCl6&#8201;:&#8201;Ln3+ is proposed. By virtue of the Na+&#8208;induced breakdown of the local site symmetry, optimal absolute NIR photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 19.0&#8201;% and 4.3&#8201;% for Yb3+ and Er3+, respectively, are achieved in Cs2Ag0.2Na0.8BiCl6 DPs through the effective sensitization of Bi3+.







Abstract
Currently, lanthanide (Ln3+)&#8208;doped near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;emitting double perovskites (DPs) suffer from low photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Herein, we develop a new class of NIR&#8208;emitting DPs based on Ln3+&#8208;doped Cs2(Na/Ag)BiCl6. Benefiting from the Na+&#8208;induced breakdown of local site symmetry in the Cs2AgBiCl6 DPs, effective NIR emissions of Ln3+ are realized through Bi3+ sensitization. Specifically, 7.3&#8208;fold and 362.9&#8208;fold enhanced NIR emissions of Yb3+ and Er3+ are achieved in Cs2Ag0.2Na0.8BiCl6 DPs relative to those in Na&#8208;free Cs2AgBiCl6 counterparts, respectively. The optimal absolute NIR PLQYs for Yb3+ and Er3+ in Cs2Ag0.2Na0.8BiCl6 DPs are determined to be 19.0&#8201;% and 4.3&#8201;%, respectively. Raman spectroscopy and first&#8208;principles density functional theory calculations verify the sublattice distortion in Cs2(Na/Ag)BiCl6 DPs via Na+ doping. These findings provide fundamental insights into the design of efficient NIR&#8208;emitting Ln3+&#8208;doped DPs for versatile optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Exploring the Influence of Inter&#8208; and Intra&#8208;crystal Diversity of Surface Barriers in Zeolites on Mass Transport by Using Super&#8208;Resolution Microimaging of Time&#8208;Resolved Guest Profiles</title>

         <dc:description>
Surface barriers of fluorescent probes in single ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites have been investigated by structured illumination microscopy. The results show inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;crystal diversity in surface barriers within batches of zeolite crystals. This approach provides a new strategy for an in&#8208;depth understanding of mass transfer at the single&#8208;crystal scale.







Abstract
The applications of nanoporous crystalline materials are closely related to the mass transfer of guest molecules. However, the fundamental knowledge of mass transfer, and in particular the surface barriers controlled by the permeation of guest molecules through the external surfaces of materials, is still incomplete. The diversity of surface permeability at the single&#8208;crystal level, caused by the varying origins of surface transport resistance, hinders the rational materials design and needs better understanding. Herein, we probe the molecular transport in single zeolite crystals with fluorescent 4&#8208;(4&#8208;diethylaminostyryl&#8208;1&#8208;methylpyridinium iodide) (DAMPI) using super&#8208;resolution structured illumination microscopy (SIM). It showed that both the inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;crystal diversity of surface barriers could be monitored by detecting the diffusion behaviors on the center and surface planes in single crystals. This adds a new perspective for studying the origins of the surface barriers as well as the molecular transport mechanisms in nanoporous materials.

         <title>Nickel Glyoximate Based Metal&#8211;Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enrich the diversity of metal&#8211;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs), two novel nickel glyoximate based MCOFs have been developed. Notably, favourable photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activities were achieved thanks to the uniformly and densely distributed Ni glyoximate functional cores on the Ni&#8208;glyoximate&#8208;COF skeletons.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs) have been recently received wide attention owing to the homogeneous distribution of active metal centers that are beneficial for enhancing the application potentials. However, metal complex based functional building blocks for MCOFs synthesis are limited. Herein, two new MCOFs (Ni&#8208;Py&#8208;COF and Ni&#8208;Bn&#8208;COF) were constructed via a novel nickel glyoximate based building block. Splendid photocatalytic activity on hydrogen evolution from water and great long&#8208;term recyclability were achieved using these nickel glyoximate based MCOFs as photocatalysts. Excitingly, even without the addition of Pt co&#8208;catalyst, the hydrogen evolution rates (HER) of Ni&#8208;Py&#8208;COF reached up to 626&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is better than many porous organic polymers. This work not only expands the type of building units for MCOFs, but also provides meaningful insights for developing stable, efficient and earth&#8208;abundant photocatalysts toward H2 generation.

         <dc:description>A metallic, covalently bonded carbon allotrope is predicted via first principles calculations. It is composed of an  sp  3  carbon framework that acts as a diamond anvil cell by constraining the distance between parallel cis&#8208;polyacetylene chains. The distance between these  sp  2  carbon atoms renders the phase metallic, and yields two well&#8208;nested nearly parallel bands that cross the Fermi level. Calculations show this phase is a conventional superconductor, with the motions of the  sp  2  carbons being key contributors to the electron phonon coupling. The  sp  3  carbon atoms impart superior mechanical properties, with a predicted Vickers hardness of 48 GPa. This phase, metastable at ambient conditions, could be made by on&#8208;surface polymerization of graphene nanoribbons, followed by pressurization of the resulting 2D sheets. A family of multifunctional materials with tunable superconducting and mechanical properties could be derived from this phase by varying the  sp  2  versus  sp  3  carbon content, and by doping.</dc:description>

         <title>Pore&#8208;Structure Control in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks (MOFs)&#160;for Capture of the Greenhouse Gas SF6 with Record Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the electronics industry, the efficient recovery and capture of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) from SF6/N2 mixtures is of great importance. Herein, three metal&#8208;organic frameworks with fine&#8208;tuning pore structures, Cu(peba)2, Ni(pba)2, and Ni(ina)2, were designed for SF6 capture. Among them, Ni(ina)2 has perfect pore sizes (6 &#197;) that are comparable to the kinetic diameter of sulfur hexafluoride (5.2 &#197;), affording the benchmark binding affinity for SF6 gas. Ni(ina)2 exhibits the highest SF6/N2 selectivity (375.1 at 298 K and 1 bar) and ultra&#8208;high SF6 uptake capacity (53.5 cm3 g&#8208;1 at 298 K and 0.1 bar) at ambient conditions.&#160;The remarkable separation performance of Ni(ina)2 was verified by dynamic breakthrough experiments. Theoretical calculations and the SF6&#8208;loaded single&#8208;crystal structure provided critical insight into the adsorption/separation mechanism. This porous coordination network has the potential to be used in industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective Oxyfunctionalization of Functionalized Benzylic Compounds with a Manganese Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new bipiperidine&#8208;based manganese catalyst is introduced, which catalyzes the chemoselective benzylic oxidation of a wide range of diverse functionalized alkyl arenes with H2O2, affording various functionalized aryl ketones, cyclic imines, and bioactive molecules under mild conditions in a short time.







Abstract
Whilst allowing for easy access to synthetically versatile motifs and for modification of bioactive molecules, the chemoselective benzylic oxidation reactions of functionalized alkyl arenes remain challenging. Reported in this study is a new non&#8208;heme Mn catalyst stabilized by a bipiperidine&#8208;based tetradentate ligand, which enables methylene oxidation of benzylic compounds by H2O2, showing high activity and excellent chemoselectivity under mild conditions. The protocol tolerates an unprecedentedly wide range of functional groups, including carboxylic acid and derivatives, ketone, cyano, azide, acetate, sulfonate, alkyne, amino acid, and amine units, thus providing a low&#8208;cost, more sustainable and robust pathway for the facile synthesis of ketones, increase of complexity of organic molecules, and late&#8208;stage modification of drugs.

         <title>Tailoring Coordination in Conventional Ether&#8208;Based Electrolytes for Reversible Magnesium&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvation sheath rearrangement by tuning the Mg2+&#8208;solvents coordination is effectively applied in the magnesium conventional electrolyte. The passivation problem due to solvent decomposition caused by the strong coordination is solved.







Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium (Mg) batteries based on conventional electrolytes are seriously plagued by the formation of the ion&#8208;blocking passivation layer on the Mg metal anode. By tracking the Mg2+ solvation sheath, this work links the passivation components to the Mg2+&#8208;solvents (1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane, DME) coordination and the consequent thermodynamically unstable DME molecules. On this basis, we propose a methodology to tailor solvation coordination by introducing the additive solvent with extreme electron richness. Oxygen atoms in phosphorus&#8208;oxygen groups compete with that in carbon&#8208;oxygen groups of DME for the coordination with Mg2+, thus softening the solvation sheath deformation. Meanwhile, the organophosphorus molecules in the rearranged solvation sheath decompose on the Mg surface, increasing the Mg2+ transport and electrical resistance by three and one orders of magnitude, respectively. Consequently, the symmetric cells exhibit superior cycling performance of over 600&#8197;cycles with low polarization.

         <title>Siliconoid Expansion by a Single Germanium Atom through Isolated Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The expansion of the cluster core of a Si6 siliconoid by a single germanium atom is readily achieved by reaction of a monolithiated Si6 siliconoid with base&#8208;stabilized GeII chlorides. Depending on the stabilizing base (1,4&#8208;dioxane or an NHC), isolable intermediates of the expansion process towards the alleged Si6GeR6 global minimum are obtained and fully characterized (&#8226;=silicon).







Abstract
The growth of (semi&#8208;)metal clusters is pivotal for nucleation processes in gaseous and condensed phases. We now report the isolation of intermediates during the expansion of a stable unsaturated silicon cluster (siliconoid) by a single germanium atom through a sequence of substitution, rearrangement and reduction. The reaction of ligato&#8208;lithiated hexasilabenzpolarene LiSi6Tip5 (1Li&#8901;(thf)2, Tip=2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl) with GeCl2&#8901;NHC (NHC=1,3&#8208;diisopropyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) initially yields the product with exohedral germanium(II) functionality, which then inserts into an Si&#8722;Si bond of the Si6 scaffold. The concomitant transfer of the chloro functionality from germanium to an adjacent silicon preserves the electron&#8208;precise nature of the formed endohedral germylene. Full incorporation of the germanium heteroatom to the Si6Ge cluster core is finally achieved either by reduction under loss of the coordinating NHC or directly by reaction of 1Li&#8901;(thf)2 with GeCl2&#8901;1,4&#8208;dioxane.

         <title>Unveiling Proton&#8208;feeding Effect in Sulfur&#8208;doped Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heteroatom&#8208;doping in metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) is considered a powerful strategy to promote electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), but the origin of enhanced catalytic activity is still elusive. Here, we disclose that sulfur doping induces an obvious proton&#8208;feeding effect for CO2RR. The model SAC catalyst with sulfur doping in second&#8208;shell of FeN4 (Fe1&#8208;NSC) was verified by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy. Fe1&#8208;NSC exhibits superior CO2RR performance compared to sulfur&#8208;free FeN4 and most reported Fe&#8208;based SAC, with a maximum CO Faradaic efficiency of 98.6% and turnover frequency of 1197 h&#8208;1. Kinetic analysis and in&#8208;situ characterizations confirm that sulfur doping accelerates H2O activation and feeds sufficient proton for promoting CO2 conversion to *COOH, which is also corroborated by the theoretical results. This work deepens the understanding of CO2RR mechanism based on SAC catalysts.</dc:description>

Kinetic analysis and in-situ characterizations confirm that sulfur doping accelerates H2O activation and feeds sufficient proton for promoting CO2 conversion to *COOH, which is also corroborated by the theoretical results. This work deepens the understanding of CO2RR mechanism based on SAC catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>The development of high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors is powered by the design and synthesis of electron&#8208;deficient building blocks with optimized physicochemical properties. By meticulously installing an imide group onto fluorene and its cyanated derivative, we report here two very electron&#8208;deficient building blocks, imide&#8208;functionalized fluorenone (FOI) and its cyanated derivative (FCNI), both featuring a deep&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level down to &#8208;4.05 eV and highly coplanar framework, endowing them ideal units for constructing n&#8208;type polymers. Thus, a series of polymers are built from them, exhibiting unipolar n&#8208;type transport character with a highest electron mobility of 0.11 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1. Hence, FOI and FCNI offer a remarkable platform for accessing high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymers and the imide functionalization of appropriate (hereo)arenes is a powerful strategy for developing polymers with deep&#8208;lying LUMOs for n&#8208;type organic electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Mediating CO2 Electroreduction Activity and Selectivity over Atomically Precise Copper Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper&#8208;based nanoclusters (NCs) are highly desirable catalysts for electrocatalytic CO2  reduction reaction (CO2RR) due to their abundance and high reactivity. In particular, atomically precise copper clusters can provide an ideal platform for correlating the structure and catalytic behaviour at the atomic level. However, systematic comparative studies of Cu cluster isomers (comprising the same number of metal atoms) with well&#8208;defined compositions and structures for electrocatalytic CO2RR are still lacking due to synthetic challenges. Herein, a group of structurally precise Cu8  cluster isomers with different core structures and peripheral ligands (a cube&#8208;shaped Cu8&#8208;1 cluster stapled with a 9H&#8208;carbazole&#8208;9&#8208;carbodithioate ligand and ditetrahedron&#8208;shaped Cu8&#8208;2 and Cu8&#8208;3 clusters stapled with 9H&#8208;carbazole&#8208;9&#8208;carbodithioate or  O&#8208;ethyl carbonodithioate and  tBuS&#8208;  ligands) was developed and investigated for highly active and selective CO2  reduction. Electrocatalytic measurements showed a significant difference in catalytic CO2RR activity and selectivity for Cu8  clusters with different kernel packing and surface structures. Ditetrahedron&#8208;shaped Cu8&#8208;2 exhibited a higher Faradaic efficiency of approximately 92% at &#8208;1.0 V (vs. RHE) for the conversion of CO2  to HCOOH and higher selectivity than the cube&#8208;shaped Cu8&#8208;1 cluster. Theoretical investigations revealed the different levels of competitiveness with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on the respective core&#8208;shaped Cu8  clusters, as well as the decreased free energies for the adsorbed HCOO* intermediates that had formed on the ditetrahedron&#8208;shaped Cu8  clusters for high activity and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Aminal&#8208;linked Porphyrinic Covalent Organic Framework for Rapid Photocatalytic Decontamination of Mustard&#8208;Gas Simulant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are appealing photocatalysts for toxic chemical degradation. Great efforts have been devoted to regulate the photocatalytic performance of COFs by tuning their organic building blocks, but the relationship between COF linkage and photochemical properties has rarely been explored. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterisation of a novel aminal&#8208;linked porphyrinic COF, namely Por&#8208;Aminal&#8208;COF. Por&#8208;Aminal&#8208;COF (0.25 mol%) showed excellent photocatalytic activity toward the detoxification of the sulfur mustard simulant with a half&#8208;life (t  1/2  ) of 5 min, which is far lower than that of traditional imine&#8208;linked Por&#8208;COF (t  1/2  = 16 min). Transient absorption spectroscopy indicated that the aminal linkages of Por&#8208;Aminal&#8208;COF facilitated the intersystem crossing process. Thus, Por&#8208;Aminal&#8208;COF showed higher triplet&#8208;state generation efficiency compared with Por&#8208;COF, consequently promoting the activation of oxygen molecular to singlet oxygen.</dc:description>

         <title>Inducing ring complexation for efficient capturing and detection of small gaseous molecules using SERS for environmental surveillance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gas&#8208;phase surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) remains challenging due to poor analyte affinity to SERS substrate. The reported use of capturing probes suffers from concurrent inconsistent signals and long response time due to formation of multiple potential probe&#8208;analyte interaction orientations. Here, we demonstrate the use of multiple non&#8208;covalent interactions for ring complexation to boost the affinity of small gas molecules, SO  2  and NO  2  , to our SERS platform, achieving rapid capture and multiplex detection down to 100 ppm. Experimental and in&#8208;silico studies affirm stable ring complex formation, and kinetic investigations reveal a 4&#8208;fold faster response time compared to probes without stable ring complexation capability. By synergizing spectral concatenation and support vector machine regression, we achieve 91.7% accuracy for multiplex quantification of SO  2  and NO  2  in excess CO  2  , mimicking real&#8208;life exhausts. Our platform shows immense potential for on&#8208;site exhaust and air quality surveillance.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering the Metal Speciation in Low&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Complexes by IMS&#8208;MS: Application to the Detection of Manganese Superoxide Dismutase Mimics in Cell Lysates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The detection and quantification of exogenous metal complexes are crucial to understanding their activity in complex biological media. Mn(II) complexes are difficult to detect and quantify because of low association constants, high lability, and fast metal exchange. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimic (or mimetic) labelled Mn1 is based on a 1,2&#8208;di&#8208;aminoethane functionalized with imidazole and phenolate and has good intrinsic anti&#8208;superoxide, antioxidant and anti&#8208;inflammatory activities in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#8208;activated intestinal epithelial HT29&#8208;MD2 cells, similar to that of its propylated analogue labelled Mn1P. Ion mobility spectrometry&#8208;mass spectrometry (IMS&#8208;MS) is a powerful technique for separating low molecular weight (LMW) metal complexes and can even separate complexes with the same ligand but bound to different divalent metal cations with similar ionic radii. We  demonstrated the intracellular presence of the Mn1 and Mn1P complexes, at least partly intact, in lysates of cells  incubated with the complexes and estimated the intracellular Mn1P concentration using a Co&#8208;  13  C  6  analogue.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Shell Engineering of a Au28 Nanocluster Boosts Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Subtle tailoring of gold nanoclusters (NCs) could significantly impart their physicochemical properties. However, direct comparison of the catalytic performance of gold NCs with identical metal core but distinct ligand shells is rarely elucidated. In this work, a novel gold NC, Au  28  (C  2  B  10  H  11  S)  12  (tht)  4  Cl  4  (  Au  28  &#8208;S  ), was isolated by a facile self&#8208;reducing synthesis.  Au  28  &#8208;S  adopts an identical Au  28  metal framework with the reported alkynyl&#8208;protected  Au  28  &#8208;C  . The different protective layers lead to distinctions in their electronic structure and optical properties. Furthermore,  Au  28  &#8208;S  shows more excellent catalytic activity for the electrochemical reduction of CO  2  to CO. Theoretical calculations identified the active sites and shed light on the catalytic mechanism to elucidate the different catalytic performances. This work provides an ideal platform to study the protective layer&#8208;activity relationship of gold NCs, and may also provide guidance in the design of metal NC&#8208;based catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>A Tandem Dehydrogenation&#8208;Driven Cross&#8208;Coupling between Cyclohexanones and Primary Amines for Construction of Benzoxazoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem dehydrogenation&#8208;driven cross&#8208;coupling reaction between cyclohexanones and primary amines is reported for benzoxazole synthesis by TEMPO's multiple reactivity modes (oxygenation and desaturation). This transition metal&#8208;free protocol features broad substrate scope, high functional group tolerance, and is operationally simple, therefore enabling late&#8208;stage functionalization and rapid synthesis of bioactive compounds, including structurally complex marketed drugs and natural products.







Abstract
Herein, we report a transition metal&#8208;free, operationally simple, general method for straightforward syntheses of 2&#8208;substituted benzoxazoles from readily available cyclohexanones and aliphatic primary amines by an imine &#945;&#8208;oxygenation&#8208;initiated cascade reaction sequence. The key to achieving high selectivity and excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance is the use of TEMPO as a mild oxidant that selectively oxidizes the reaction intermediates through its multiple reactivity modes, thus facilitating the individual steps to proceed in succession. More than 70 substrate combinations are disclosed, demonstrating the reliability of this protocol to synthesize structurally diverse products, including marketed drugs, drug candidate, and natural products that are unattainable by the existing methods.

         <title>A Bioinspired Iron&#8208;Molybdenum &#956;&#8208;Nitrido Complex and Its Reactivity toward Ammonia Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of a thiolate&#8208;bridged iron&#8208;molybdenum &#956;&#8208;nitrido complex allows the stepwise transformation of N3&#8722;&#8594;NH2&#8722;&#8594;NH2&#8722;&#8594;NH3 in which all the key intermediates are isolated and well&#8208;characterized. It offers a unique perspective into the heterometallic cooperativity in the FeMo&#8208;cofactor.







Abstract
Multimetallic nitride species, especially those containing biologically related iron or molybdenum, are fundamentally important to understand the nitrogen reduction process catalysed by FeMo&#8208;nitrogenase. However, until now, there remains no report about the construction of structurally well&#8208;defined FeMo heteronuclear nitrido complex and its reactivity toward ammonia formation. Herein, a novel thiolate&#8208;bridged FeIIMoVI complex featuring a bent Fe&#8722;N&#8801;Mo fragment is synthesized and structurally characterized, which can be easily protonated to form a &#956;&#8208;imido complex. Subsequently, through the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) process, this imido species can smoothly convert into the &#956;&#8208;amido complex, which can further undergo reductive protonation to afford the FeMo complex containing an ammine ligand. Overall, we present the first well&#8208;defined {Fe(&#956;&#8208;S)2Mo} platform that can give a panoramic picture for the late stage (N3&#8722;&#8594;NH2&#8722;&#8594;NH2&#8722;&#8594;NH3) of biological nitrogen reduction by the heterometallic cooperativity.

A pyridine&#8208;enabled transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free regioselective aromatic nucleophilic cage B(4)&#8208;H amination of 1,2&#8208;diaryl&#8208;o&#8208;carboranes with magnesium bisamides, giving a class of B(4)&#8208;aminated o&#8208;carboranes is reported.

Abstract
The nucleophilic aromatic BH substitution reaction of carboranes is uncommon, compared to the electrophilic one. This work reported a pyridine&#8208;enabled transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free regioselective nucleophilic aromatic cage B(4)&#8208;H amination of 1,2&#8208;diaryl&#8208;o&#8208;carboranes with magnesium bisamides, giving a series of B(4)&#8208;aminated o&#8208;carboranes. DFT calculations showcased a stepwise B&#8722;N formation/B&#8722;H cleavage process, in which Mg&#8722;H formation/cage closure is the rate&#8208;determining step. Unprecedentedly, in the presence of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridyl (dtbpy), a tandem B(4)&#8208;amination/cage isomerization reaction of o&#8208;carboranes was discovered for the facile preparation of B(2)&#8208;aminated m&#8208;carboranes. Control experiments indicated that magnesium complex, bidentate ligand (dtbpy) and reaction temperature were crucial in the cage isomerization process. This direct nucleophilic aromatic cage B&#8722;H amination reaction offers an alternative strategy for selective amination of o&#8208; and m&#8208;carboranes.

         <title>An Unusual Oxidative Rearrangement Catalyzed by a Divergent Member of the 2&#8208;Oxoglutarate&#8208;Dependent Dioxygenase Superfamily during Biosynthesis of Dehydrofosmidomycin</title>

         <dc:description>
DfmD is a highly divergent member of the 2&#8208;oxoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase superfamily that catalyzes desaturation, rearrangement and demethylation of its substrate. In vitro biochemical studies and homology modeling suggest that these transformations occur via novel chemistry.







Abstract
The biosynthesis of the natural product dehydrofosmidomycin involves an unusual transformation in which 2&#8208;(trimethylamino)ethylphosphonate is rearranged, desaturated and demethylated by the enzyme DfmD, a divergent member of the 2&#8208;oxoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase superfamily. Although other members of this enzyme family catalyze superficially similar transformations, the combination of all three reactions in a single enzyme has not previously been observed. By characterizing the products of in vitro reactions with labeled and unlabeled substrates, we show that DfmD performs this transformation in two steps, with the first involving desaturation of the substrate to form 2&#8208;(trimethylamino)vinylphosphonate, and the second involving rearrangement and demethylation to form methyldehydrofosmidomycin. These data reveal significant differences from the desaturation and rearrangement reactions catalyzed by other family members.

         <title>Anchoring Black Phosphorus Quantum Dots on Fe&#8208;Doped W18O49 Nanowires for Efficient Photocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation</title>

Anchoring black phosphorus quantum dots on Fe&#8208;doped W18O49 nanowires significantly promoted the photocatalytic performances for N2 fixation into NH3.







Abstract
Herein, we demonstrate that the surface anchoring of black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) and bulk iron&#8208;doping in W18O49 nanowires significantly promotes the photocatalytic activity toward N2 fixation into NH3. More specifically, a NH3 production rate of up to 187.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 could be achieved, nearly one order of magnitude higher than that of pristine W18O49 (18.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). Comprehensive experiments and density&#8208;functional theory calculations reveal that Fe&#8208;doping could enhance the reducing ability of photo&#8208;generated electrons by decreasing the work function and elevating the defect band (d&#8208;band) centers. Additionally, the surface BPQDs anchoring could facilitate the N2 adsorption/activation owing to the increased adsorption energy and advantaged W&#8722;P dimer bonding&#8208;mode. Therefore, synergizing the surface BPQD anchoring and bulk Fe&#8208;doping remarkably enhanced the photocatalytic activity of W18O49 nanowires for NH3 production.

         <title>Stable Lead&#8208;Free Tin Halide Perovskite with Operational Stability &gt;1200&#8201;h by Suppressing Tin(II) Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;stable all&#8208;inorganic lead&#8208;free Cs4SnBr6 perovskites were obtained by using SnF2 as tin source. The doping of F ions can significantly suppress the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ in Cs4SnBr6 perovskites, thus achieving excellent stability against oxygen, moisture and light irradiation for 1200&#8197;h.







Abstract
Sn&#8208;based perovskites are the most promising alternative materials for Pb&#8208;based perovskites to address the toxicity problem of lead. However, the development of SnII&#8208;based perovskites has been hindered by their extreme instability. Here, we synthesized efficient and stable lead&#8208;free Cs4SnBr6 perovskite by using SnF2 as tin source instead of easily oxidized SnBr2. The SnF2 configures a fluorine&#8208;rich environment, which can not only suppress the oxidation of Sn2+ in the synthesis, but also construct chemically stable Sn&#8722;F coordination to hinder the electron transfer from Sn2+ to oxygen within the long&#8208;term operation process. The SnF2&#8208;derived Cs4SnBr6 perovskite shows a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 62.8&#8201;%, and excellent stability against oxygen, moisture, and light radiation for 1200&#8197;h, representing one of the most stable lead&#8208;free perovskites. The results pave a new pathway to enhance the optical properties and stability of lead&#8208;free perovskite for high&#8208;performance light emitters.

         <title>Ultrafast Dynamics of Photochemical Nitrile Imine Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Femtosecond UV&#8208;pump/IR&#8208;probe spectroscopy elucidates the molecular mechanism of the photo&#8208;induced 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloelimination of N2 from a tetrazole. In liquid solution, the nitrile imine photoproduct is a very floppy molecule that can adopt a variety of different conformations ranging from propargylic all the way to allenic structures.







Abstract
The chemical reactivity of nitrile imines is of great utility in organic synthesis with applications rapidly expanding into the materials and life sciences. Yet, our understanding of the electronic and molecular structures of nitrile imines remains incomplete and the elementary mechanism of their photoinduced generation is entirely unknown. Here, femtosecond infrared spectroscopy after 266&#8197;nm&#8208;excitation of 2,5&#8208;diphenyltetrazole has been carried out to temporally resolve the formation and structural relaxation dynamics of the nascent diphenylnitrile imine in liquid solution under ambient conditions. The infrared&#8208;spectroscopic evolution is interpreted by an initial sequence of intersystem crossings within 250&#8197;fs followed by the cleavage of N2 with formation of a structurally relaxed nitrile imine on the adiabatic ground&#8208;state singlet surface within a few tens of picoseconds. The infrared spectrum supports the notion of a &#8220;floppy&#8221; nitrile imine molecule whose equilibrium character ranges from fully propargylic to fully allenic in the room temperature liquid solution.

         <title>Enhancement of Plasmon&#8208;Induced Photoelectrocatalytic Water Oxidation over Au/TiO2 with Lithium Intercalation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low quantum efficiency is a bottleneck for the development of the surface plasmon resonance effect in solar energy conversion. The enhanced electroconductivity and surface catalytic ability of TiO2 after Li+ intercalation can help to achieve highly efficient hot electrons collection and hot holes usage in Au/Li0.2TiO2. Au/Li0.2TiO2&#8217;s quantum efficiency of plasmon&#8208;induced water oxidation is greatly increased to 2&#8201;% compared to 0.03&#8201;% for Au/TiO2.







Abstract
Plasmon&#8208;induced chemical reaction is an emerging field but its development faces huge challenges because of low quantum efficiency. Herein, we report that the solar energy conversion efficiency of Au/TiO2 in plasmon&#8208;induced water oxidation is greatly enhanced by intercalating Li+ into TiO2. An incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency as high as 2.0&#8201;%@520&#8197;nm is achieved by Au/Li0.2TiO2 in photoelectrocatalytic water oxidation, realizing a 33&#8208;fold enhancement in photocurrent density compared with Au/TiO2. The superior photoelectrocatalytic performance is mainly ascribed to the enhanced electric conductivity and higher catalytic activity of Li0.2TiO2. Furthermore, the ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy suggests that lithium intercalation into TiO2 could change the dynamics of hot electron relaxation in Au nanoparticles.

     alt="Enhancement of Plasmon-Induced Photoelectrocatalytic Water Oxidation over Au/TiO2 with Lithium Intercalation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low quantum efficiency is a bottleneck for the development of the surface plasmon resonance effect in solar energy conversion. The enhanced electroconductivity and surface catalytic ability of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; after Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; intercalation can help to achieve highly efficient hot electrons collection and hot holes usage in Au/Li&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Au/Li&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8217;s quantum efficiency of plasmon-induced water oxidation is greatly increased to 2&#8201;% compared to 0.03&#8201;% for Au/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plasmon-induced chemical reaction is an emerging field but its development faces huge challenges because of low quantum efficiency. Herein, we report that the solar energy conversion efficiency of Au/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in plasmon-induced water oxidation is greatly enhanced by intercalating Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; into TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. An incident photon-to-current efficiency as high as 2.0&#8201;%@520&#8197;nm is achieved by Au/Li&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in photoelectrocatalytic water oxidation, realizing a 33-fold enhancement in photocurrent density compared with Au/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The superior photoelectrocatalytic performance is mainly ascribed to the enhanced electric conductivity and higher catalytic activity of Li&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, the ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy suggests that lithium intercalation into TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; could change the dynamics of hot electron relaxation in Au nanoparticles. This work demonstrates that intercalation of alkaline ions into semiconductors can promote the charge separation efficiency of the plasmonic effect of Au/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Machine Learning for Chemical Reactivity: The Importance of Failed Experiments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Learning from failure? The performance of machine learning models depends critically on the data quality. This study investigates the possibility of learning chemical reactivity from reaction databases. In model experiments, the impact of experimental errors, biased experiment selection and incomplete result reporting are analyzed for predicting cross&#8208;coupling yields. These results showcase directions&#8212;and what it takes to enhance data quality.







Abstract
Assessing the outcomes of chemical reactions in a quantitative fashion has been a cornerstone across all synthetic disciplines. Classically approached through empirical optimization, data&#8208;driven modelling bears an enormous potential to streamline this process. However, such predictive models require significant quantities of high&#8208;quality data, the availability of which is limited: Main reasons for this include experimental errors and, importantly, human biases regarding experiment selection and result reporting. In a series of case studies, we investigate the impact of these biases for drawing general conclusions from chemical reaction data, revealing the utmost importance of &#8220;negative&#8221; examples. Eventually, case studies into data expansion approaches showcase directions to circumvent these limitations&#8212;and demonstrate perspectives towards a long&#8208;term data quality enhancement in chemistry.

         <title>Transesterification of Non&#8208;Activated Esters Promoted by Small Molecules Mimicking the Active Site of Hydrolases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small artificial hydrolase that mimics the active centre of chymotrypsin and N&#8208;terminal hydrolases is able to perform, for the first time, the transesterification of ethyl acetate with methanol under neutral conditions and at room temperature. This artificial enzyme also catalysed the transesterification of important neurotransmitter acetylcholine into methyl acetate and choline.







Abstract
The synthesis of small molecules able to mimic the active site of hydrolytic enzymes has been largely pursued in recent decades. The high reaction rates and specificity shown by natural hydrolases present an attractive target, and yet the preparation of suitable small&#8208;molecule mimics remains challenging, requiring activated substrates to achieve productive outcomes. Here we present small synthetic artificial enzymes which mimic the catalytic site and the oxyanion hole of chymotrypsin and N&#8208;terminal hydrolases and are able to perform, for the first time, the transesterification of a non&#8208;activated ester such as ethyl acetate with methanol under mild and neutral reaction conditions.

         <title>Constructing Organic Electroluminescent Material with Very High Color Purity and Efficiency Based on Polycyclization of the Multiple Resonance Parent Core</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) molecular construction paradigm based on polycyclization of the MR parent core has been proposed, and a representative MR&#8208;PAH based on para&#8208;alignment of boron and nitrogen atoms into a six&#8208;membered ring (p&#8208;BNR) has been constructed. The OLED employing the target model molecule BN&#8208;TP as an emitter exhibits ultrapure green emission with CIE coordinates of (0.26, 0.70) and a maximum EQE of 35.1&#8201;%.







Abstract
Multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) compounds have set off an upsurge of research because of their tremendous application prospects in the field of wide color gamut display. Herein, we propose a novel MR&#8208;TADF molecular construction paradigm based on polycyclization of the multiple resonance parent core, and construct a representative multiple resonance polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (MR&#8208;PAH) based on the para&#8208;alignment of boron and nitrogen atoms into a six&#8208;membered ring (p&#8208;BNR). Through the retrosynthesis analysis, a concise synthesis strategy with wide applicability has been proposed, encompassing programmed sequential boron esterification, Suzuki coupling and Scholl oxidative coupling. The target model molecule BN&#8208;TP shows green fluorescence with an emission peak at 523&#8197;nm and a narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 34&#8197;nm. The organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) employing BN&#8208;TP as an emitter exhibits ultrapure green emission with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.26, 0.70), and achieves a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 35.1&#8201;%.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Stable Iron Pentacarbonyl Radical Cation Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The open&#8208;shell iron pentacarbonyl cation [Fe(CO)5].+ was synthesized and isolated as a stable salt for the first time. The strategy involved the use of a strong deelectronator, i.e., single&#8208;electron oxidant, in combination with weakly coordinating anions (WCAs). The iron carbonyl complex is a novel example of low&#8208;valent iron and has thus been fully characterized. Isolation was achieved using standard laboratory conditions in combination with fluorinated benzenes as solvents.







Abstract
The open&#8208;shell iron pentacarbonyl cation [Fe(CO)5].+ was isolated by deelectronation, i.e., the single&#8208;electron oxidation of the parent neutral Fe(CO)5 using [phenazineF].+ as the [Al(ORF)4]&#8722; and [F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; salt (RF=C(CF3)3; phenazineF=perfluoro&#8208;5,10&#8208;bis(perfluorophenyl)&#8208;5,10&#8208;dihydrophenazine). [Fe(CO)5].+[Al(ORF)4]&#8722; was fully characterized (scXRD analysis, IR, NMR, EPR, 57Fe spectroscopy, CV and SQUID magnetization study) and, apart from being a compound of fundamental interest, may serve as a precursor for low&#8208;valent iron coordination chemistry.

The elusive phosphametallacyclobutadiene intermediate is isolated and characterized. This intermediate reveals insights into rapid and reversible C&#8722;C bond formation/cleavage, enabling the cycling between a trianionic pincer and a tetraanionic pincer ligand at will.







Abstract
The reactivity of phosphaalkynes, the isolobal and isoelectronic congeners to alkynes, with metal alkylidyne complexes is explored in this work. Treating the tungsten alkylidyne [tBuOCO]W&#8801;CtBu(THF)2 (1) with phosphaalkyne (10) results in the formation of [O2C(tBuC=)W{&#951;2&#8208;(P,C)&#8722;P&#8801;C&#8722;Ad}(THF)] (13&#8208;tBuTHF) and [O2C(AdC=)W{&#951;2&#8208;(P,C)&#8722;P&#8801;C&#8722;tBu}(THF)] (13&#8208;AdTHF); derived from the formal reductive migratory insertion of the alkylidyne moiety into a W&#8722;Carene bond. Analogous to alkyne metathesis, a stable phosphametallacyclobutadiene complex [tBuOCO]W[&#954;2&#8208;C(tBu)PC(Ad)] (14) forms upon loss of THF from the coordination sphere of either 13&#8208;tBuTHF or 13&#8208;AdTHF. Remarkably, the C&#8722;C bonds reversibly form/cleave with the addition or removal of THF from the coordination sphere of the formal tungsten(VI) metal center, permitting unprecedented control over the transformation of a tetraanionic pincer to a trianionic pincer and back. Computational analysis offers thermodynamic and electronic reasoning for the reversible equilibrium between 13&#8208;tBu/AdTHF and 14.

         <dc:description>1,3&#8208;Allyl and 1,2&#8208;allyl shifts through [3,3]&#8208; and [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangements are well&#8208;established and widely used in organic synthesis. In contrast, 1,5&#8208;allyl shift through related [3,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement is unknown because [3,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement is Woodward&#8208;Hoffmann forbidden. Herein, we report an unexpected discovery of a 1,5&#8208;allyl shift of allyl furfuryl alcohol. Mechanistically, this 1,5&#8208;allyl shift is achieved by two steps through sequential ring expansion/contraction rearrangements: 1) Achmatowicz rearrangement (AchR, ring expansion), and 2) cascade oxonia&#8208;Cope rearrangement/retro&#8208;Achmatowicz rearrangement (ring contraction). This new 1,5&#8208;allyl shift method is demonstrated with &gt;20 examples and expected to find applications in organic synthesis and materials chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Functionalization of Carboranes at Electron&#8208;Rich Boron Vertex: Photocatalytic B&#8208;C Coupling via&#160;a Carboranyl Cage Radical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functionalization of carborane in a vertex&#8208;specific manner is a perennial challenge. Here, we report a photocatalytic B&#8208;C coupling for selective functionalization of carboranes at the boron site which is most distal to carbon. This reaction protocol was achieved by photo&#8208;induced decarboxylation of carborane carboxylic acids to generate boron vertex&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals. Theoretical calculations also demonstrate that the reaction more easily occurs at the boron site bearing higher electron density owing to the lower energy barrier for a single electron transfer to generate a carboranyl radical. By using this strategy, a number of functionalized carboranes through alkylation, alkenylation, and heteroarylation could be accessed under mild conditions. Moreover, both a highly efficient blue emitter with the solid&#8208;state luminous efficiency of 42% and a Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) drug candidate containing targeting and fluorine units were obtained.</dc:description>

         <title>Homochiral Multiferroic Cyanido&#8208;Bridged Dimetallic Complexes Assembled by C&#8211;F&#183;&#183;&#183;K Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyanido&#8208;bridged dimetallic complexes have attracted substantial attention due to the variety of structures with various interesting properties. However, the homochiral cyanido&#8208;bridged dimetallic complexes are rare, and endowing them with ferroelectricity has long been a great challenge. Here, through the introduction of C&#8211;F&#183;&#183;&#183;K interactions between the guest chiral cations and the host [KFe(CN)  6  ]  2&#8211;  framework, we design three&#8208;dimensional cyanido&#8208;bridged dimetallic multiferroics, [  R  &#8208; and  S  &#8208;3&#8208;fluoropyrrolidinium]  2  [KFe(CN)  6  ] (  R  &#8208; and  S  &#8208;3&#8208;FPC). The mirror&#8208;symmetric vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) signal demonstrates their enantiomeric feature.  R  &#8208; and  S  &#8208;3&#8208;FPC crystallize in the same chiral&#8208;polar space group  P  2  1  at 298 K. Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), polarizing optical microscopy, and temperature&#8208;dependent second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) measurements demonstrate their multiferroic properties that is the coexistence of ferroelectricity and ferroelasticity, in line with the Aizu notation of 222F2. Importantly, the  R  &#8208;3&#8208;FPC shows excellent ferroelectricity with saturated polarization up to 9.4  &#956;  C/cm  2  , much higher than those of other cyanido&#8208;bridged ferroelectrics. This work provides a viable way to design chiral cyanido&#8208;bridged dimetallic ferroelectrics and multiferroics.</dc:description>

         <title>Origin of Red&#8208;Shifted Phosphorescence from Triphenylamines: Triplet Excimer or Impurity?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triphenylamine (TPA) was reported to exhibit temperature&#8208;dependent dual phosphorescence, where the red&#8208;shifted band was assigned as the excimeric phosphorescence with an energy shift of &gt; 3,000 cm&#8208;1 (J. Phys. Chem., 1991, 95, 7189). Here we show that purified TPA (purity: &gt;99.97%) shows a single phosphorescence band with a small energy shift of &lt; 200 cm&#8208;1 under the same experimental condition. The new experimental results, along with theoretical calculations, suggest that the previously reported triplet excimer of TPA is probably not valid and is most likely due to an unidentified impurity. As&#8208;received TPA samples, however, do exhibit temperature&#8208;dependent dual phosphorescence bands, and the wavelength, relative intensity, and temperature dependence of the lower&#8208;energy phosphorescence band vary significantly depending on dopant structures. It was found that dopant phosphorescence could still become dominant even in dilute third&#8208;party solutions of the host at low temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Water Soluble Melanin&#8208;Protein&#8208;Fe/Cu Conjugates Derived from Norepinephrine as Reliable Models for Neuromelanin of Human Brain Locus Coeruleus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water soluble melanin&#8208;protein&#8208;Fe/Cu conjugates derived from norepinephrine and fibrillar &#946;&#8208;lactoglobulin are reliable models for neuromelanin (NM) of human brain  locus coeruleus  . Both iron and copper promote catecholamine oxidation and exhibit strong tendency to remain coupled in oligonuclear aggregates. The Fe&#8208;Cu clusters are EPR silent and affect the  1  H NMR spectra of the conjugates through a specific sequence of signals. Derivatives containing only Fe or Cu exhibit different NMR patterns. The EPR spectra show weak signals of paramagnetic Fe  III  in conjugates containing Fe or mixed Fe&#8208;Cu sites due to small amounts of mononuclear centers. The latter derivatives exhibit EPR signals for isolated Cu  II  centers. These features parallel the EPR behavior of NM from  locus coeruleus  . The spectral data indicate that Fe  III  is bound to the melanic fraction whereas Cu  II  is bound on the protein fibrils, suggesting that the Fe&#8208;Cu clusters occur at the interface between the two components of the synthetic NMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Relaxation of the Plant Cell Wall Barrier via Zwitterionic Liquid Pretreatment for Micelle&#8208;Complex&#8208;Mediated DNA Delivery to Specific Plant Organelles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeted delivery of genes to specific plant organelles is a key challenge for fundamental plant science, plant bioengineering, and agronomic applications. Nanoscale carriers have attracted interest as a promising tool for organelle&#8208;targeted DNA delivery in plants. However, nanocarrier&#8208;mediated DNA delivery in plants is severely hampered by the barrier of the plant cell wall, resulting in insufficient delivery efficiency. Herein, we propose a unique strategy that synergistically combines a cell wall&#8208;loosening zwitterionic liquid (ZIL) with a peptide&#8208;displaying micelle complex for organelle&#8208;specific DNA delivery in plants. We demonstrated that ZIL pretreatment can enhance the cell wall permeability without cytotoxicity, allowing the micelle complexes to translocate across the cell wall and carry the DNA cargo into specific plant organelles, such as nuclei and chloroplasts, with significantly augmented efficiency. Our work offers a novel concept to overcome the plant cell wall barrier for nanocarriermediated cargo delivery to specific organelles in living plants.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling the Valence&#8208;Electron Arrangement of Nickel Active Centers for Efficient Hydrogen Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The valence&#8208;electron arrangement of heterogeneous catalysts could significantly affect binding behaviors of absorbates. However, it remains a challenge to understand the role of valence&#8208;electron arrangement in electrocatalysis, limiting its utilization as a tool to design efficient electrocatalysts. Here, we present a precise control of valence&#8208;electron arrangement of Ni active centers for hydrogen oxidation by using Ni&#8208;vacancy&#8208;enriched Ni3N as a platform. These Ni vacancies can promote valence&#8208;electron delocalization of OH&#8208;adsorption centers to enhance Ni ds&#8208;O 2p valence&#8208;electron&#8208;orbital interaction with elevated OH adsorption. Meanwhile, the valence&#8208;electron missing of H&#8208;adsorption centers at Ni vacancies can lower Ni ds&#8208;H 1s interaction with weakened H binding. Relative to Ni3N poor in vacancies, the Ni&#8208;vacancy&#8208;enriched Ni3N showed a mass activity enhanced by 15&#8208;fold. This strategy paves a rational way to design efficient catalysts by finely tuning the valence&#8208;electron arrangement.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Oxidative Coupling of Methane to Ethylene in a Solid Oxide Electrolyser based on Porous Single&#8208;crystalline CeO2 Monoliths</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic conversion of CH4  to C2H4  plays an important role in light olefin industry. Here, we report the electrochemical conversion of CH4  to C2H4/C2H6  at anode with the electrolysis of CO2  to CO at cathode in a solid oxide electrolyser. We construct well&#8208;defined interfaces to function as three&#8208;phase boundaries by exsolving single&#8208;crystalline Ni nanoparticles in porous single&#8208;crystalline CeO2  monoliths. We engineer the chemical states and flux of active oxygen species for the oxidation of CH4  in anode by controlling voltage and temperature. We show the unprecedented C2  selectivity (C2H4  and C2H6) of &#8805;99.5% at the CH4  conversion of ~7%. The electrolyser exhibits excellent durability without performance degradation being observed in a continuous operation of 100 hours. Our work would enable a novel path for the selective conversion of CH4/CO2  into useful chemicals, and the technique of building well&#8208;defined interfaces may find potential applications in other fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Sensitive, Selective and Repeatable Fluorescence Sensor for Methanol based on Highly Emissive 0D Hybrid Lead&#8208;free Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Convenient and rapid detection method toward methanol out of ethanol remains an insurmountable challenge due to their indistinguishable physical properties. Herein, a novel fluorescence probe based on perovskite was successfully designed to overcome this bottle neck. We report a new zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid perovskite of [MP]  2  In  x  Sb  1&#8208;x  Cl  7  &#183;6H  2  O (MP = 2&#8208;Methylpiperazine) displaying unusual green light emission with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield. Remarkably, this 0D perovskite exhibits reversible methanol&#8208;responsive luminescence switching between green and yellow color but fail in any other organic vapors. Even for blended alcohol solutions, the luminescent probe remains to exhibit excellent sensing performance with multiple superiorities of rapid responsive time (30 s) and ultra&#8208;low detection limit (40 ppm), etc. Therefore, this 0D perovskite can be utilized as a perfect fluorescence probe to detect trace of methanol from ethanol with ultrahigh sensitivity, selectivity and repeatability. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first perovskite as fluorescence probe toward methanol with wide potentials in environmental monitoring and methanol detection, etc.</dc:description>

         <title>Microplastics and their Additives in the Indoor Environment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Analyses of air and house dust have shown that pollution of the indoor environment with microplastics could pose a fundamental hygienic problem. Indoor microplastics result from abrasion, microplastic beads are frequently added to household products and microplastic granules can be found in artificial turf for sports activities or synthetic admixtures in riding hall litter. Then the question came up to what extent particulate emissions of thermoplastic materials from 3D printing are at least partially to be classified as microplastics or nanoplastics. The discussion about textiles as a possible source of indoor microplastics has also been intensified. The subject of this study is an overview of the current exposure of residents to microplastics. Trends can be identified from the results and preventive measures can be derived if necessary. It is recommended that microplastics and their additives be given greater consideration in indoor environmental surveys in the future.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Janus materials are anisotropic nano&#8208; and micro architect&#173;ures with two different faces consisting of distinguishable or opposite physicochemical properties. In parallel with the discovery of new methods for the fabrication of these materials, decisive progress has been made in their application, e.g. in biological science, catalysis, pharma&#173;ceuticals and more recently, in battery technology. This mini&#8208;review systematically covers recent and significant achievements in the application of task&#8208;specific Janus nano&#8208;materials as heterogeneous catalysts in various types of chemical reactions, including reduction, oxidative desulfurization and dye degradation, asymmetric catalysis, biomass transformation, cascade reactions, oxidation, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross coupling reactions, electro&#8208; and photocatalytic reactions as well as gas&#8208;phase reactions. Finally, an outlook on possible future applications is given.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Emeriones A&#8211;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report asymmetric bioinspired total syntheses of the fungal metabolites emeriones A&#8211;C via stereoselective oxidations of two bicyclo[4.2.0]octadiene diastereomers. The central bicyclic scaffolds are prepared in an 8&#960;/6&#960; electrocyclization cascade of a stereodefined pentaene, which contains the fully assembled side chains of the emeriones. The anti&#8208;aldol side chain is made using a Paterson&#8208;aldol addition, and the epoxide of the dioxabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane side chain via ring&#8208;closure onto an oxidized acetal. Our work has enabled the structural revision of emerione C, and resulted in the synthesis of a &#8220;missing&#8221; family member, which we call emerione D. DFT calculations identified two methyl groups that govern torquoselectivity in the 8&#960;/6&#960; cascade.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis and Prediction of Ulodione Natural Products Guided by DFT Calculations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A biomimetic synthetic strategy has resulted in a 2&#8208;step total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;ulodione A and the prediction of two potential natural products, (&#177;)&#8208;ulodiones C and D. This work was guided by computational investigations into the selectivity of a proposed biosynthetic Diels&#8211;Alder dimerization, which was then utilized in the chemical synthesis. This work highlights how biosynthetic considerations can both guide the design of efficient synthetic strategies and lead to the anticipation of new natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimizing Pt Electronic States through Formation of Schottky Junction on Non&#8208;reducible Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Charge transfer between metal sites and supports is crucial for catalysis. Redox&#8208;inert supports are usually unfavorable due to their less electronic interaction with metal sites, which, we demonstrate, is not always correct. Herein, three metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are chosen to mimic inert or active supports for Pt nanoparticles (NPs) and the photocatalysis is studied. Results demonstrate the formation of Schottky junction between Pt and the MOFs, leading to electron donation effect of the MOFs. Under light irradiation, both the MOF electron donation effect and Pt interband excitation dominate the Pt electron density. Compared with the &#8220;active&#8221; UiO&#8208;66 and MIL&#8208;125 supports, Pt NPs on the &#8220;inert&#8221; ZIF&#8208;8 exhibit higher electron density due to the higher Schottky barrier, resulting in superior photocatalytic activity. This work optimizes metal catalysts with non&#8208;reducible support, and promotes the understanding of the relationship between metal&#8208;support interaction and photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Counter Electrode Reactions &#8211; Important Stumbling Blocks on the Way to a Working Electro&#8208;Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the past two decades, electro&#8208;organic synthesis gained significant interest in technical and academic research as well as applications. The omission of stoichiometric oxidizers or reducing agents enables a more sustainable route for redox reactions in organic chemistry. Even if it is well&#8208;known, that every electrochemical oxidation is only viable with an associated reduction reaction and vice versa, the relevance of counter reaction is often less addressed. In this review, the importance of the corresponding counter reaction in electro&#8208;organic synthesis is highlighted and how this can affect performance and selectivity of the electrolytic conversion. A selection of common strategies and unique concepts to tackle this issue are surveyed providing a guide to select appropriate counter reactions for electro&#8208;organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Native Ambient Mass Spectrometry of an Intact Membrane Protein Assembly and Soluble Protein Assemblies Directly from Lens Tissue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane proteins constitute around two&#8208;thirds of therapeutic targets but present a significant challenge for structural analysis due to their low abundance and solubility. Existing methods for structural analysis rely on over&#8208;expression and/or purification of the membrane protein, thus removing any links back to actual physiological environment. Here, we demonstrate mass spectrometry analysis of an intact oligomeric membrane protein directly from tissue. Aquaporin&#8208;0 exists as a 113 kDa tetramer, with each subunit featuring six transmembrane helices. We report characterisation of the intact assembly directly from a section of sheep eye lens without sample pre&#8208;treatment. Protein identity was confirmed by mass measurement of the tetramer and subunits, together with top&#8208;down mass spectrometry, and the spatial distribution was determined by mass spectrometry imaging. Our approach allows simultaneous analysis of soluble protein assemblies in the tissue.</dc:description>

         <title>High Temperature and Dynamic RGB (Red&#8208;Green&#8208;Blue) Long&#8208;Persistent Luminescence in an Anti&#8208;Kasha Organic Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic LPL (long persistent luminescence) materials have sparked extensive research interest due to the ultralong&#8208;lived triplet states. Although numerous organic LPL have been reported, most of the triplet emission was static and monotonous. Therefore, LPL materials with dynamic triplet emission need to develop urgently. A triamino&#8208;  s  &#8208;triazine derivative  1  with dynamic LPL was fabricated. Single crystal structure shows that the abundant intermolecular interactions and small free volume restrict the molecular motion and avoid the quenchers. Spectral and theoretical calculations upheld the existence of multiple excited states in  1  , and the migration of electrons between multiple excited state is very sensitive to external stimuli. By modulating the stimulus, the residence of electrons in different triplet states can be manipulated to achieve RGB LPL. Importantly, blue LPL was achieved by manipulating the anti&#8208;Kasha emission. And the red LPL can still be observed at high temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatiotemporally Selective Molecular Imaging via Upconversion Luminescence&#8208;Controlled, DNA&#8208;Based Biosensor Technology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of DNA&#8208;based biosensor technologies has shown great potential in chemical and biological detection. These biosensors have been actively pursued as probes for molecular imaging in live cells and in animals, allowing in situ detection of analytes in complex biological systems, elucidation the roles of key molecules in biological processes, and the ability to achieve non&#8208;invasive diagnosis and image&#8208;guided surgery. Despite the progress made, the improvement of the spatial&#8208;temporal precision remains a challenge in this field. In this Minireview, we present a concept methodology of spatiotemporally selective molecular imaging via the combination of light&#8208;activatable DNA&#8208;based biosensor engineering with upconversion nanotechnology. We then highlight the application of the approach for spatiotemporally&#8208;controlled imaging of various targets in specific intracellular organelles, signal amplification, as well as the regulation of targeting activity to receptor proteins. We finally discuss the challenges and perspectives for possible future developments in this emerging field.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroboration of Alkynes with Carboranes: Facile Construction of a Library of Boron Cluster&#8208;Based AIE&#8208;Active Luminogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The classical Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active luminogens (AIEgens) usually include two&#8208;dimensional aromatic systems such as tetraphenylethenes, which are synthesized in several steps by using toxic additives. Here, we proposed a new molecular design strategy for the realization of AIE property by combining three&#8208;dimensional aromatic boron clusters of carboranes&#160;to vinyl group(s). To obtain a library of the boron cluster&#8208;based AIEgens, a Pd&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration of alkynes with carborane is reported. This reaction protocol proceeds in one step under mild conditions with rapid reaction rate, excellent yields and regioselectivity. Photophysical property studies demonstrate that the facile molecular motions in solution can be inhibited in the solid state for these molecules, which leads to interesting AIE property. This work provides not only a general design principle for AIEgens but also an efficient methodology to synthesize boron cluster&#8208;based photo&#8208;functional molecules.</dc:description>

Oxidation with two equivalents of the ferrocenium salt, [Fe(Cp)  2  ](BArF  24  ), affords the dicationic tricarbonyl complex [Fe(CO)  3  &#8208;&#951;  4  &#8208;{(IPr)  2  C  2  P  2  }](BArF  24  )  2  (  4  ).

         <title>Methylamine Lithium Borohydride as Electrolyte for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fast Li&#8208;ion conductivity at room temperature is a major challenge for utilization of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li batteries. Metal borohydrides with neutral ligands are a new emerging class of solid&#8208;state ionic conductors, and here we report the discovery of a new mono&#8208;methylamine lithium borohydride with very fast Li  +  conductivity at room temperature. LiBH  4  &#8729;CH  3  NH  2  crystallizes in the monoclinic space group  P  2  1  /  c  , forming a two&#8208;dimensional unique layered structure. The layers are separated by hydrophobic &#8211;CH  3  moieties, and contain large voids, allowing for fast Li&#8208;ionic conduction in the interlayers, &#963;(Li+) = 1.24&#8729;10  &#8208;3  S/cm at room temperature. The electronic conductivity is negligible, and the electrochemical stability is ~2.1 V vs Li. The first all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery using a lithium borohydride with a neutral ligand as the electrolyte, Li&#8208;metal as the anode and TiS  2  as the cathode is demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>2,4,6&#8208;triphenylpyrylium (TPT+) functioned as a classic organic photocatalyst exhibits a noteworthy absorption in the visible range, strongly oxidizing excited states, and a somewhat unstable structure. Inspired by the nuclear chromophore and dual catalysis strategy, herein, we report a universal photoredox platform constructed by TPT+&#8208;mimic bridging ligands and reductive metal ions on the basis of metal&#8208;organic supramolecular systems for various organic couplings and molecular oxygen activation under visible light irradiation. Significant photoinduced electron transfer and ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer events are both integrated and regulated by the spatial and kinetic confinement effects of the structurally confined microenvironments, effectively improving the efficiency of electron transfer and radical&#8208;radical coupling processes in photocatalysis.

         <title>Tuning Interphase Chemistry to Stabilize High&#8208;Voltage LiCoO2 Cathode Material via Spinel Coating</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cathode electrolyte interphases (CEI) are critical to cycling stability of high&#8208;voltage cathodes for batteries, yet their formation mechanism and properties remain elusive. Here we report that the compositions of CEI are largely controlled by abundant species in inner Helmholtz layer (IHL) and can be tuned from material aspects. The IHL of LiCoO2 (LCO) was found to alter after charging, with solvent&#8208;rich environment that results in fragile organic&#8208;rich CEI. By passivated spinel Li4Mn5O12 coating, we achieve anion&#8208;rich IHL after charging, thus enabling robust LiF&#8208;rich CEI. In&#8208;situ microscopy reveals that LiF&#8208;rich CEI maintains mechanical integrity at 500 &#176;C, in sharp contrast to organic&#8208;rich CEI with severe expansion and subsequent voids/cracks in cathode. As a result, the spinel&#8208;coated LCO exhibits a high specific capacity of 194 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.05 C and a capacity retention of 83% after 300 cycles at 0.5 C. Our work sheds new light on modulating CEI for advanced lithium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Active Si Sites Enabled by Negative Valent Ru for Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution in LaRuSi</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery and identification of novel active sites are paramount for deepening the understanding of the catalytic mechanism and driving the development of remarkable electrocatalysts. Here, we reveal that the genuine active sites for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in LaRuSi are Si sites, not the usually assumed Ru sites. Ru in LaRuSi has a peculiar negative valence state, which leads to strong hydrogen binding to Ru sites. Surprisingly, the Si sites have a Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption that is near zero (0.063 eV). The moderate adsorption of hydrogen on Si sites during the HER process is also validated by in situ Raman analysis. Based on it, LaRuSi exhibits an overpotential of 72 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2  in alkaline media, which is close to the benchmark of Pt/C. This work sheds light on the recognition of real active sites   and the exploration of innovative silicide HER electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

Surprisingly, the Si sites have a Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption that is near zero (0.063 eV). The moderate adsorption of hydrogen on Si sites during the HER process is also validated by in situ Raman analysis. Based on it, LaRuSi exhibits an overpotential of 72 mV at 10 mA cm-2  in alkaline media, which is close to the benchmark of Pt/C. This work sheds light on the recognition of real active sites   and the exploration of innovative silicide HER electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nitric Oxide&#8208;Releasing aza&#8208;BODIPY: A New Near&#8208;Infrared J&#8208;Aggregate with Multiple Antibacterial Modalities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) J&#8208;aggregates has received increasing attention due to their broad applications. Here, we report the nitrosation of an amine&#8208;containing aza&#8208;BODIPY precursor (  BDP&#8208;NH  2  ), affording the first nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;releasing NIR J&#8208;aggregate (  BDP&#8208;NO  ). The introduction of  N  &#8208;nitrosamine moieties efficiently inhibits the aromatic interactions of  BDP&#8208;NH  2  , which instead promotes the formation of J&#8208;aggregates within micellar nanoparticles with a remarkable bathochromic shift of ~109 nm to the NIR window (820 nm). Interestingly, the NO release and photothermal conversion efficiency (PTCE) can be delicately tuned by the loading contents of  BDP&#8208;NO  within micellar nanoparticles, thereby enabling multiple antibacterial modalities by exploring either NO release, photothermal therapy (PTT), or both. We demonstrate the combination of NO and PTT can elevate antibacterial activity while attenuating PTT&#8208;associated inflammation for the  in vivo  treatment of MRSA infection.</dc:description>

In this study, a reasonable strategy guided by theoretical calculations was employed to fabricate a novel high&#8208;order multiphoton excited fluorescence (H&#8208;MPEF)&#8208;responsive UiO&#8208;type metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF,  ZrTc  ).

The results reveal that the extended &#960;&#8208;electron system, enhanced charge transfer, improved dipole moment, and weakened &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions within the MOFs endow them with excellent H&#8208;MPEF performance for NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;induced fluorescence imaging.

         <title>Monitoring Reaction Intermediates to Predict Enantioselectivity Using Mass Spectrometry
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diastereomeric intermediates can be separated by ion mobility mass spectrometry. Monitoring of the kinetics of the intermediates allows the prediction of the overall reaction enantioselectivity. The experiments can be performed in a small scale and do not require an isolation of the products.







Abstract
Enantioselective reactions are at the core of chemical synthesis. Their development mostly relies on prior knowledge, laborious product analysis and post&#8208;rationalization by theoretical methods. Here, we introduce a simple and fast method to determine enantioselectivities based on mass spectrometry. The method is based on ion mobility separation of diastereomeric intermediates, formed from a chiral catalyst and prochiral reactants, and delayed reactant labeling experiments to link the mass spectra with the reaction kinetics in solution. The data provide rate constants along the reaction paths for the individual diastereomeric intermediates, revealing the origins of enantioselectivity. Using the derived kinetics, the enantioselectivity of the overall reaction can be predicted. Hence, this method can offer a rapid discovery and optimization of enantioselective reactions in the future. We illustrate the method for the addition of cyclopentadiene (CP) to an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehyde catalyzed by a diarylprolinol silyl ether.

         <title>A Lattice Matching Strategy for Highly Reversible Copper Metal Anodes in Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper (Cu) metal is an attractive anode material of aqueous rechargeable batteries due to its high theoretical specific capacity (844 mAh g  &#8208;1  ), good environmental compatibility and high earth abundance. However, the Cu anodes often suffer from poor deposition/stripping reversibility and nonuniform deposition during the charge/discharge process, degrading the lifetime of aqueous Cu metal batteries. Herein, a lattice matching strategy was developed to design high&#8208;performance Cu metal anodes. In such strategy, Ni substrates that exhibit high lattice matching with Cu was selected to support the Cu anodes. The high lattice matching endows Cu anodes with high deposition/stripping reversibility, low nucleation overpotential as well as a uniform and dense electrodeposition on Ni substrates. Based on the Ni substrate&#8208;supported Cu anodes, the full cells paired with lead dioxide cathodes show a capacity retention of 99.3% after 200 charge/discharge cycles. This work provides a route for the design of high&#8208;performance Cu electrodes in aqueous rechargeable batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery and Genetic Code Expansion of a Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) Hydrolase from the Human Saliva Metagenome for the Degradation and Bio&#8208;Functionalization of PET</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a bioinformatic workflow and subsequent discovery of a new polyethylene terephthalate (PET) hydrolase, which we named MG8, from the human saliva metagenome. MG8 has robust PET plastic degradation activities under different temperature and salinity conditions, outperforming several naturally occurring and engineered hydrolases in degrading PET. Moreover, we genetically encode 2,3&#8208;diaminopropionic acid (DAP) in place of the catalytic serine residue of MG8, thereby converting a PET hydrolase into a covalent binder for bio&#8208;functionalization of PET. We show that MG8(DAP), in conjunction with a split green fluorescent protein system, can be used to attach protein cargos to PET as well as other polyester plastics. The discovery of a highly active PET hydrolase from the human metagenome&#8212;currently an underexplored resource for industrial enzyme discovery&#8212;as well as the repurposing of such an enzyme into a plastic functionalization tool, should facilitate ongoing efforts to degrade and maximize reusability of PET.</dc:description>

         <title>Alternative Benzoxazole Assembly Discovered in Anaerobic Bacteria Provides Access to Privileged Heterocyclic Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzoxazole scaffolds feature prominently in diverse synthetic and natural product&#8208;derived pharmaceuticals. Our understanding of their bacterial biosynthesis is, however, limited to ortho&#8208;substituted heterocycles from Actinomycetes. We report an overlooked biosynthetic pathway in anaerobic bacteria (typified in Clostridium cavendishii) that expands the benzoxazole chemical space to meta&#8208;substituted heterocycles and heralds a distribution beyond Actinobacteria. The first benzoxazoles from the anaerobic realm (closoxazole A and B) were elucidated by NMR and chemical synthesis. By genome editing in the native producer, heterologous expression in Escherichia coli, and systematic pathway dissection we show that closoxazole biosynthesis invokes an unprecedented precursor usage (3&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxybenzoate) and manner of assembly. Synthetic utility was demonstrated by the precursor&#8208;directed biosynthesis of a tafamidis analogue. A bioinformatic survey reveals the pervasiveness of related gene clusters in diverse bacterial phyla.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Hydrocarbamoylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The asymmetric hydroaminocarbonylation of olefins represents a straightforward approach for the synthesis of enantioenriched amides, but is hampered by the necessity to employ CO gas, often at elevated pressures. We herein describe, as an alternative, an enantioselective hydrocarbamoylation of alkenes leveraging dual copper hydride and palladium catalysis to enable the use of readily available carbamoyl chlorides as a practical carbamoylating reagent. The protocol is applicable to various types of olefins, including alkenyl arenes, terminal alkenes, and 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes. Substrates containing a diverse range of functional groups as well as heterocyclic substructures undergo functionalization to provide  &#945;  &#8208; and  &#946;  &#8208;chiral amides in good yields and with excellent enantioselectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Formal &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;H Arylation of Aldehydes and Ketones by Cooperative Nickel and Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;C&#8208;H&#8208;functionalization of ketones and aldehydes has been intensively explored in organic synthesis. The functionalization of unactivated &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;H bonds in such carbonyl compounds is less well investigated and developing a general method for their &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;H arylation remains challenging. Herein we report a method that uses cooperative nickel and photoredox catalysis for the formal &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;H arylation of aldehydes and ketones with (hetero)aryl bromides. The method features mild conditions, remarkable scope and wide functional group tolerance. Importantly, the introduced synthetic strategy also allows the &#946;&#8208;alkenylation, &#946;&#8208;alkynylation and &#946;&#8208;acylation of aldehydes under similar conditions. Mechanistic studies revealed that this transformation proceeds through a single electron oxidation/Ni&#8208;mediated coupling/reductive elimination cascade.</dc:description>

         <title>Straightforward Access to Multifunctional &#960;&#8208;Conjugated P&#8208;Heterocycles Featuring an Internal Ylidic Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the straightforward one&#8208;pot synthesis of novel 5 or 6&#8208;membered P&#8208;heterocycles featuring an internal ylidic bond: P&#8208;containing acenaphthylenes and phenanthrenes. The stability of the compounds tolerates post&#8208;functionalization through direct arylation to introduce electron&#8208;rich/poor substituents and the synthetic strategy is also compatible with the preparation of more elaborated polyaromatic scaffolds such acenes and helicenes. Using a joint experimental (X&#8208;ray analysis, optical and redox properties) and theoretical approach, we perform a full structure&#8208;property relationships study on these new platforms. In particular, we show that molecular engineering allows not only tuning their absorption/emission on the entire visible range but also endowing them with chiroptical or non&#8208;linear optical properties, making them valuable dyes for a large panel of photonic or opto&#8208;electronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Evolution and Single&#8208;Droplet Analysis of Fuel&#8208;Driven Compartments by Droplet&#8208;Based Microfluidics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Active droplets are a great model for membraneless organelles. However, the analysis of these systems remains challenging and is often limited due to the short timescales of their kinetics. We use droplet&#8208;based microfluidics to encapsulate a fuel&#8208;driven cycle that drives phase separation into coacervate droplets to overcome this challenge. This approach enables the analysis of every coacervate&#8208;based droplet in the reaction container throughout its lifetime. We discovered that the fuel concentration dictates the formation of the coacervate&#8208;based droplets and their properties. We observe that coacervate&#8208;based droplets grow through fusion, decay simultaneously independent of their volume, and shrinkage rate scales with their initial volume. This method helps to further understand the regulation of membraneless organelles, and we believe the analysis of individual coacervate&#8208;based droplets enables future selection&#8208; or evolution&#8208;based studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Stepwise Arylation of Unprotected Peptides by PtIV Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selective stepwise arylation of S&#8722;H and N&#8722;H bonds in unprotected peptides by air&#8208; and moisture&#8208; stable PtIV complexes is reported. These compounds showed high reactivity and selectivity toward the N terminal NH2 group over other N&#8722;H bonds in complex biologically relevant substrates.







Abstract
LPtIVF(Aryl) complexes bearing a bulky bidentate 2&#8208;[bis(adamant&#8208;1&#8208;yl)phosphino]phenoxide ligand (L) demonstrate excellent reactivity and selectivity in the arylation of X&#8722;H (X=S, N) bonds of amino acid residues in unprotected peptides under mild, including aqueous, conditions. Stepwise addition of these complexes allowed a convenient one&#8208;pot introduction of different aromatic groups in the X&#8722;H bonds of Cys and N terminus. PtIV reagents can also be used to further arylate N&#8722;H bonds in Lys and Trp providing access to peptides bearing multiple aromatic groups.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of 2D Hybrid Double Perovskites on 3D Cs2AgBiBr6 Crystals towards Ultrasensitive Detection of Weak Polarized Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the self&#8208;assembly of 2D double perovskite (BLA)2CsAgBiBr7&#160;  (BLA = benzylammonium) on 3D Cs2AgBiBr6  crystals, providing the first demonstration of polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetection using lead&#8208;free double perovskite HCs. The (BLA)2CsAgBiBr7/Cs2AgBiBr6  HC successfully combines the anisotropy of 2D double perovskites with the well&#8208;defined interface provided by heterogeneous integration. Driven by the built&#8208;in electric field in junction, photodetectors of HCs exhibit unique polarization dependence of zero&#8208;bias photocurrent with a large anisotropy ratio up to 9, which is 6 times amplified as compared to the pristine 2D (BLA)2CsAgBiBr7. More importantly, the present devices can remain polarization sensitive with incident light intensity down to nW/cm^2 level. Our study on lead&#8208;free hybrid perovskite HCs marks a step toward establishing robust material foundations for fundamental scientific investigations and the development of optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>An Oxazine&#8208;Based Fluorogenic Probe with Changeable &#960;&#8208;conjugation to Eliminate False&#8208;Positive Interference of Albumin and Its Application to Sensing Aminopeptidase N</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many fluorophores/probes suffer from the interference of albumin in biosystems. Herein, we propose an effective strategy to overcome this interference by virtue of both an albumin&#8208;insensitive fluorophore and its changeable &#960;&#8208;conjugation, and demonstrate it by designing an oxazine&#8208;based fluorogenic probe for aminopeptidase N (APN). The modification on the N atom in the oxazine fluorophore with alanine through a cleavable linker locks the resulting probe in a non&#8208;conjugated, colorless and non&#8208;fluorescent state, so the non&#8208;specific interaction of albumin produces no spectroscopic response. APN can selectively cleave the alanine moiety, restoring the large &#960;&#8208;conjugation and strong fluorescence. The capability of the probe to eliminate the albumin influence has been demonstrated by imaging APN in different cell lines, and by quantitatively determining APN in human serum and mouse urine. The present strategy may be useful for developing more specific fluorogenic probes for other enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing the Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte Interfacial Stability Model with Na&#8211;K Liquid Alloy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interfacial stability study based on a unique multi&#8208;cation liquid Na&#8211;K alloy anode is conducted with long cycle&#8208;life and small overpotential after stabilization, revealing the decomposition model and the relationship between kinetic factors and interfacial composition in solid&#8208;state batteries. Designs based on this model can control the charge&#8208;selection process and improve the performance of a dendrite&#8208;free Na&#8211;K solid&#8208;state battery.







Abstract
In this work, the Na&#8211;K liquid alloy with a charge selective interfacial layer is developed to achieve an impressively long cycling life with small overpotential on a sodium super&#8208;ionic conductor solid&#8208;state electrolyte (NASICON SSE). With this unique multi&#8208;cation system as the platform, we further propose a unique model that contains a chemical decomposition domain and a kinetic decomposition domain for the interfacial stability model. Based on this model, two charge selection mechanisms are proposed with dynamic chemical kinetic equilibrium and electrochemical kinetics as the manners of control, respectively, and both are validated by the electrochemical measurements with microscopic and spectroscopic characterizations. This study provides an effective design for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density solid&#8208;state battery with alkali Na&#8211;K anode, but also presents a novel approach to understand the interfacial chemical processes that could inspire and guide future designs.

         <title>One&#8208;For&#8208;All Polyolefin Functionalization: Active Ester as Gateway to Combine Insertion Polymerization with ROP, NMP, and RAFT</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Polyolefin Active&#8208;Ester Exchange (PACE) process serves as a bridge connecting coordination&#8211;insertion polymerization to multiple controlled polymerization methods. It allows for the synthesis of hybrid materials that comprise olefins and ester, styrene, vinylic, acrylate, and acrylamide segments with a broad window for tunability. Nano&#8208;objects with higher&#8208;order morphologies can be obtained directly via RAFT&#8208;mediated PISA.







Abstract
This work develops the Polyolefin Active&#8208;Ester Exchange (PACE) process to afford well&#8208;defined polyolefin&#8211;polyvinyl block copolymers. &#945;&#8208;Diimine PdII&#8208;catalyzed olefin polymerizations were investigated through in&#8208;depth kinetic studies in comparison to an analog to establish the critical design that facilitates catalyst activation. Simple transformations lead to a diversity of functional groups forming polyolefin macroinitiators or macro&#8208;mediators for various subsequent controlled polymerization techniques. Preparation of block copolymers with different architectures, molecular weights, and compositions was demonstrated with ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP), nitroxide&#8208;mediated polymerization (NMP), and photoiniferter reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (PI&#8208;RAFT). The significant difference in the properties of polyolefin&#8211;polyacrylamide block copolymers was harnessed to carry out polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) and study the nanostructure behaviors.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Reinforced Solvation for a Gradient Inorganic&#8208;Rich Interphase Enables High&#8208;Rate and Stable Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gradient inorganic&#8208;rich interphase is constructed on Na surface in a high&#8208;concentration ether&#8208;based electrolyte with a cosolvent hydrofluoroether. It leads to a configuration of solvent&#8211;cation&#8211;anion clusters for a reinforced inner solvation sheath. The derived interphase results in a reduced energy barrier for Na+ migration and fast interfacial kinetics, and hence excellent electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Metallic Na is a promising anode for rechargeable batteries, however, it is plagued by an unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and Na dendrites. Herein, a robust anion&#8208;derived SEI is constructed on Na anode in a high&#8208;concentration 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME) based electrolyte with a cosolvent hydrofluoroether, which effectively restrains Na dendrite growth. The hydrofluoroether can tune the solvation configuration of the electrolyte from three&#8208;dimensional network aggregates to solvent&#8211;cation&#8211;anion clusters, enabling more anions to enter and reinforce the inner solvation sheath and their stepwise decomposition. The gradient inorganic&#8208;rich SEI leads to a reduced energy barrier of Na+ migration and enhanced interfacial kinetics. These render the Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 battery with an excellent rate capability of 79.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 24&#8197;C and a high capacity retention of 94.2&#8201;% after 6000&#8197;cycles at 2&#8197;C. This highlights the modulation of the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphase chemistry for advanced batteries.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metallic Na is a promising anode for rechargeable batteries, however, it is plagued by an unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and Na dendrites. Herein, a robust anion-derived SEI is constructed on Na anode in a high-concentration 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) based electrolyte with a cosolvent hydrofluoroether, which effectively restrains Na dendrite growth. The hydrofluoroether can tune the solvation configuration of the electrolyte from three-dimensional network aggregates to solvent&#8211;cation&#8211;anion clusters, enabling more anions to enter and reinforce the inner solvation sheath and their stepwise decomposition. The gradient inorganic-rich SEI leads to a reduced energy barrier of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; migration and enhanced interfacial kinetics. These render the Na||Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; battery with an excellent rate capability of 79.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 24&#8197;C and a high capacity retention of 94.2&#8201;% after 6000&#8197;cycles at 2&#8197;C. This highlights the modulation of the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphase chemistry for advanced batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unbiased C3&#8208;Electrophilic Indoles: Triflic Acid Mediated C3&#8208;Regioselective Hydroarylation of N&#8722;H Indoles
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct dearomative C3&#8208;functionalization of indoles provided access to privileged scaffolds by an umpolung strategy. Against all odds, C3&#8208;indolium intermediates could be generated from NH&#8208;indoles under operationally simple conditions with triflic acid at room temperature to promote intra&#8208; and intermolecular C3&#8208;regioselective hydroarylation. DFT studies suggest that these cationic or dicationic intermediates could be stabilized by H&#8208;bonded clusters.







Abstract
The direct dearomative addition of arenes to the C3 position of unprotected indoles is reported under operationally simple conditions, using triflic acid at room temperature. The present regioselective hydroarylation is a straightforward manner to generate an electrophilic indole at the C3 position from unbiased indoles in sharp contrast to previous strategies. This atom&#8208;economical method delivers biologically relevant 3&#8208;arylindolines and 3,3&#8208;spiroindolines in high yields and regioselectivities from both intra&#8208; and intermolecular processes. DFT computations suggest the stabilization of cationic or dicationic intermediates with H&#8208;bonded (TfOH)n clusters.

         <title>Thionitrite (SNO&#8722;) and Perthionitrite (SSNO&#8722;) are Simple Synthons for Nitrosylated Iron Sulfur Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple Fe2+ ions, such as those that are bioavailable in the labile iron pool, react with thionitrite (SNO&#8722;) and perthionitrite (SSNO&#8722;) to yield synthons to biologically&#8208;relevant Fe&#8722;S clusters.







Abstract
S/N crosstalk species derived from the interconnected reactivity of H2S and NO facilitate the transport of reactive sulfur and nitrogen species in signaling, transport, and regulatory processes. We report here that simple Fe2+ ions, such as those that are bioavailable in the labile iron pool (LIP), react with thionitrite (SNO&#8722;) and perthionitrite (SSNO&#8722;) to yield the dinitrosyl iron complex [Fe(NO)2(S5)]&#8722;. In the reaction of FeCl2 with SNO&#8722; we were able to isolate the unstable intermediate hydrosulfido mononitrosyl iron complex [FeCl2(NO)(SH)]&#8722;, which was characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. We also show that [Fe(NO)2(S5)]&#8722; is a simple synthon for nitrosylated Fe&#8722;S clusters via its reduction with PPh3 to yield Roussin's Red Salt ([Fe2S2(NO)4]2&#8722;), which highlights the role of S/N crosstalk species in the assembly of fundamental Fe&#8722;S motifs.

         <title>Double&#8208;Modification Oriented Design of a Deep&#8208;UV Birefringent Crystal Functionalized by [B12O16F4(OH)4] Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double&#8208;modification strategy, that is, introducing two types of anions (F and OH), is used to increase the polarizability anisotropy and HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap simultaneously. This leads to the discovery a new metal&#8208;free (NH4)4[B12O16F4(OH)4] with the unprecedented [B12O16F4(OH)4] giant cluster as a potential deep&#8208;UV birefringent crystal. It shows the largest birefringence (of &#916;nexp.=0.12 at 546.1&#8197;nm) among all inorganic hydroxyborates.







Abstract
Polarization modulation of deep&#8208;UV light is of significance to current technologies, and to this end, the birefringent crystal has emerged as an invaluable material as it allows for effective light modulation. Herein, a double&#8208;modification strategy driven by F and OH anions that makes double effects towards the critical property enhancement of deep&#8208;UV birefringent crystals is proposed. This leads to a new hydroxyborate (NH4)4[B12O16F4(OH)4] with giant cluster as a deep&#8208;UV birefringent crystal with large birefringence (&#916;nexp.=0.12@546.1&#8197;nm). This birefringence is a record among inorganic hydroxyborates with experimentally measured birefringence. Structural analysis shows that the near&#8208;plane arrangement of [B12O16F4(OH)4] cluster is responsible for the large optical anisotropy. Theoretical calculations indicate that its &#960;&#8208;conjugated [BO3] and [BO2OH] units are the main source of this large optical anisotropy.

         <title>Controlling the Energy&#8208;Transfer Processes in a Nanosized Molecular Upconverter to Tap into Luminescence Thermometry Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Control of the energy transfer to establish the application potential for molecular upconverters is demonstrated in a molecular cluster aggregate (MCA). Using a spherical MCA with a judicious choice of the metal composition, we show luminescence thermometry accessed via molecular upconversion for the first time.







Abstract
Photon upconversion (UC) in molecular species remains a highly sought&#8208;after property with vast potential applications in many fields. Until now, a few reports on molecular upconverters are limited to demonstrating upconversion. The low UC quantum yields (QY) and nuclearities hindered the application capabilities for molecular upconverters. To overcome these limitations, we report the use of a molecular cluster&#8208;aggregate (MCA) containing 20 lanthanide ions to target YbIII&#8208;TbIII&#8208;based cooperative UC. Upconversion quantum yield value of 1.04&#215;10&#8722;4&#8201;%, among the highest value observed for a molecular cooperative UC, was attained for the {Gd11Tb2Yb7} composition. Substitution of GdIII ions for EuIII centers opens a YbIII&#8594;TbIII&#8594;EuIII energy&#8208;transfer pathway, allowing the first proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of potential application for molecular UC. This report on upconversion&#8208;based luminescence thermometry in a molecular species endorses further development of upconversion properties of nanoscale MCAs.

         <title>Selective CO2 Photoreduction to CH4 via Pd&#948;+&#8208;Assisted Hydrodeoxygenation over CeO2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal oxide nanosheets doped with positively charged Pd&#948;+ sites can act as the active sites of water activation to offer additional H* species, which could improve the probability of further protonation over the carbon&#8208;containing intermediates, thus promoting the selectivity of CO2 photoreduction to CH4.







Abstract
Here, noble&#8208;metal&#8208;doped two&#8208;dimensional metal oxide nanosheets are designed to realize selective CO2 photoreduction to CH4. As a prototype, Pd&#8208;doped CeO2 nanosheets are fabricated, where the active sites of Pd&#948;+ (2&lt;&#948;&lt;4) and Ce3+&#8722;Ov are revealed by quasi in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra and in situ electron paramagnetic resonance spectra. Moreover, in situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectra of D2O photodissociation and desorption verify the existence of the Pd&#8722;OD bond, implying that Pd&#948;+ sites can participate in water oxidation to deliver H* species for facilitating the protonation of the intermediates. Furthermore, theoretical calculations suggest the Pd doping could regulate the formation energy barrier of the key intermediates CO* and CH3O*, thus making CO2 reduction to CH4 become the favorable process. Accordingly, Pd&#8208;doped CeO2 nanosheets achieve nearly 100&#8201;% CH4 selectivity of CO2 photoreduction, with the raising CH4 evolution rate of 41.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.

         <title>Rapid and Sequential Dual Oxime Ligation Enables De Novo Formation of Functional Synthetic Membranes from Water&#8208;Soluble Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual oxime bond formation enables the spontaneous generation of functional membranes from non&#8208;amphiphilic, water&#8208;soluble precursors at physiological conditions in the micromolar concentration range. In situ lipid synthesis proceeds in the absence of detergents, facilitating membrane protein reconstitution.







Abstract
Cell membranes define the boundaries of life and primarily consist of phospholipids. Living organisms assemble phospholipids by enzymatically coupling two hydrophobic tails to a soluble polar head group. Previous studies have taken advantage of micellar assembly to couple single&#8208;chain precursors, forming non&#8208;canonical phospholipids. However, biomimetic nonenzymatic coupling of two alkyl tails to a polar head&#8208;group remains challenging, likely due to the sluggish reaction kinetics of the initial coupling step. Here we demonstrate rapid de novo formation of biomimetic liposomes in water using dual oxime bond formation between two alkyl chains and a phosphocholine head group. Membranes can be generated from non&#8208;amphiphilic, water&#8208;soluble precursors at physiological conditions using micromolar concentrations of precursors. We demonstrate that functional membrane proteins can be reconstituted into synthetic oxime liposomes from bacterial extracts in the absence of detergent&#8208;like molecules.

         <title>Regioselective Magnesiations of Fluorinated Arenes and Heteroarenes Using Magnesium&#8208;bis&#8208;Diisopropylamide (MBDA) in Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various fluoro&#8208;substituted aromatics and heterocycles were magnesiated with the hydrocarbon&#8208;soluble organomagnesium amide (iPr2N)2Mg (magnesium&#8208;bis&#8208;diisopropylamide; MBDA) at non&#8208;cryogenic temperatures providing thermally stable arylmagnesium amides (or diheteroarylmagnesium amides in the case of heterocyclic substrates). Trapping reactions with typical electrophiles furnished polyfunctional fluoro&#8208;substituted building blocks.







Abstract
We report a convenient preparation of a new and storable magnesium amide (iPr2N)2Mg (magnesium&#8208;bis&#8208;diisopropylamide; MBDA) which proved to be especially suitable for the non&#8208;cryogenic magnesiation of fluoro&#8208;substituted arenes and heteroarenes providing arylmagnesium amides (ArMgDA) or bis&#8208;heteroaryl magnesiums (HetAr)2Mg in hydrocarbons. Further reactions with electrophiles (aldehydes, ketones, allylic bromides, aryl halides (Negishi cross&#8208;coupling)) furnished a range of polyfunctional fluoro&#8208;substituted unsaturated building blocks. Several postfunctionalizations were described as well as NMR&#8208;studies confirming the dimeric structure of the base.

         <title>Enantiomorphic Single Crystals of Linear Lead(II) Bromide Perovskitoids with White Circularly Polarized Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
White circularly polarized emission based on lead(II) bromide perovskitoids was successfully achieved. The emission results from the synergistic combination of chiral organic cations and lead bromide inorganic anions. The chiral lead(II) bromide perovskitoids are obtained through a concise synthesis process, and they show excellent white&#8208;emission photoluminescence quantum yields and ultrastable persistence in ambient conditions.







Abstract
Chiroptical hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites are emerging as a new class of promising materials with mirror optical signal responses for optoelectronic applications. However, chiroptical white&#8208;emission materials have been scarcely unearthed. Herein, four pairs of hybrid lead(II) bromide perovskitoids were obtained, namely, (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;(H2MPz)PbBr4 (R/S&#8208;MPz=(R)&#8208;(&#8722;)/(S)&#8208;(+)&#8208;2&#8208;methylpiperazine) (1 and 2), (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;(H2MPz)3Pb2Br10&#8901;2&#8201;DMAc (3 and 4), (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;(H2MPz)PbBr4&#8901;0.5&#8201;MeCN (5 and 6) and (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;(H2MPz)2Pb2Br8&#8901;DCM (7 and 8). Notably, they all exhibit ultrabroadband emission and chiroptical signals. Perovskitoids 3&#8211;6 even achieve white circularly polarized emission with a high dissymmetric factor (glum) (&#177;3&#215;10&#8722;3 for 3 and 4; &#177;8&#215;10&#8722;3 for 5 and 6). This new type of hybrid perovskitoids will attract attention and find applications in chiroptical fields because of the extensively and easily tunable photophysical properties.

         <title>Role of Nanoscale Roughness and Polarity in Odd&#8211;Even Effect of Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of solvent polarity on the roughness&#8208;dependency of wetting behavior of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) was investigated by studying the static contact angle of a variety of probing liquids, with different polarities, on SAMs formed on Ag&#8208;based substrate with different surface morphology. Phase&#8208;transition like behavior in SAMs due to substrate roughness is observed.







Abstract
The dependency of substrate roughness on wetting properties of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) has been studied extensively, but most previous studies used limited selection of probing liquid and range of surface roughness. These studies disregarded the limit to observation of sub&#8208;nanometer odd&#8211;even parity effect, hence are inconclusive. In this work we report the role of solvent polarity on the roughness&#8208;dependency of wetting behavior of SAMs by studying static con&#8208;tact angle of a variety of probing liquids, with different polarities, on SAMs formed on Ag&#8208;based substrate with different surface morphology. By overlapping the roughness ranges with previous studies on Au, the limitation of surface roughness (RMS=1&#8197;nm) to observation of the odd&#8211;even effect using water as probing liquid was confirmed, but other probing liquid yielded different roughness&#8208;dependent behaviors, with more polar solvent showing more roughness&#8208;dependent behavior. Based on these observations, we concluded that there exists a phase&#8208;transition like behavior in SAMs due to substrate roughness and molecule chain length, but whose determination is dependent on the probing liquid.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Tolerant Photoredox Catalysis Triggers Nitric Oxide Release for Antibacterial Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen&#8208;tolerant photoredox catalysis is used for the controlled release of nitric oxide signaling molecules under physiological conditions. This new NO&#8208;releasing platform shows excellent antimicrobial activity and kills bacteria by hyperpolarizing and permeabilizing bacterial membranes, which can not only eradicate pathogens but also accelerate the healing of MRSA&#8208;infected wounds.







Abstract
Photoredox catalysis has emerged as a robust tool for chemical synthesis. However, it remains challenging to implement photoredox catalysis under physiological conditions due to the complex microenvironment and the quenching of photocatalyst by biologically relevant molecules such as oxygen. Here, we report that UV&#8208;absorbing N,N&#8242;&#8208;dinitroso&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylenediamine derivatives can be selectively activated by fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3 photocatalyst within micellar nanoparticles under visible light irradiation (e.g., 500&#8197;nm) through photoredox catalysis in aerated aqueous solutions to form quinonediimine (QDI) residues with concomitant release of NO. Notably, the formation of QDI derivatives can actively scavenge the reactive oxygen species generated by fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3, thus avoiding oxygen quenching of the photocatalyst. Further, we exemplify that the oxygen&#8208;tolerant photoredox catalysis&#8208;mediated NO release can not only kill planktonic bacteria in vitro but also efficiently treat MRSA infections in vivo.

         <title>Hierarchical Hollow Zinc Oxide Nanocomposites Derived from Morphology&#8208;Tunable Coordination Polymers for Enhanced Solar Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Six zinc&#8208;containing coordination&#8208;polymer particles (Zn&#8208;CPPs) with multivariate characters were selectively prepared using a ligand competition strategy and further calcined to form hollow ZnO microparticles. The secondary design integrates hollow ZnO and O&#8208;ZnIn2S4 into a hierarchical tubular architecture with double&#8208;heterojunction shells and efficient charge&#8208;transfer nanochannels for superior solar H2&#8208;releasing activity.







Abstract
Infinite coordination&#8208;polymer particles (CPPs) are promising materials for solar energy conversion with high efficiency. However, the range of organic ligands that may be used to create CPPs is limited, as are strategies for modification, thereby hindering the applications of such material. In this paper, competitive evolution&#8211;morphological and structural change from Zn&#8208;based crystallites to amorphous particles is described. Controlled contribution of organic linkers selectively derived six Zn&#8208;CPPs with multivariate characters. Based on the diversity of these substructures, hollow zinc oxide particles were initially formed by self&#8208;pyrolysis of CPPs and effectively modified by ultrathin doped nanosheets. The obtained double&#8208;sided heterojunctions offer fully&#8208;covered active sites, bringing together efficient light&#8208;excited charge&#8208;transfer nanochannels, which exhibit an excellent solar H2&#8208;releasing activity (e.g., 4512.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1) and stable cyclability.

         <title>A Facile Approach to Produce Star Polymers Based on Coordination Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy based on coordination polymerization to synthesize star polymers with highly regular arms via a common insertion reaction between a carbon&#8211;heteroatom unsaturated bond and the metal&#8211;alkyl species is proposed. The yield of star polymers reaches values as high as 91.8&#8201;%. Employing this method, a synthetic polyisoprene rubber with green strength up to 1.99&#8197;MPa superior to the natural rubber (RSS1: 1.43&#8197;MPa) was prepared for the first time.







Abstract
Many efforts have been devoted to preparing star polymers. Research into coordination polymerization, the most powerful stereoselective process to endow polymers with superb properties, lags far behind those achieved by radical polymerization and ionic polymerization. Herein, we propose a facile strategy to prepare star polymers with regular arms based on coordination polymerization via an insertion reaction between the carbon&#8211;heteroatom unsaturated bond and the metal&#8211;alkyl species. Terminating a living cis&#8208;1,4&#8208;selective isoprene polymerization by using isocyanate as cross&#8208;linker (CL), a star polyisoprene with low polydispersity was obtained in high yield (91.8&#8201;%). A kinetic study showed the star polymer was formed via a step&#8208;growth procedure. The types of CL and the ratio of [CL]0&#8201;:&#8201;[Cat.]0 are key factors to determine the arm number and the yield of star polymer. Finally, synthetic IR rubber with a green strength up to 1.99&#8197;MPa superior to natural rubber (1.43&#8197;MPa) was prepared for the first time.

         <title>A Separation&#8208;Sensing Platform Performing Accurate Diagnosis of Jaundice in Complex Biological Tear Fluids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An SiO2@Au@AuNPs substrate was constructed as a separation sensing platform. This separation performance depends on the pore size. Three types of diffusion occur, including interception, single&#8208;file diffusion and Fickian diffusion. This structure was integrated into a home&#8208;made tear assay kit for the diagnosis of jaundice.







Abstract
The detection of biomarkers in tears has aroused great interest owing to the advantages of non&#8208;invasive and rapid collection. The combination of ultrasensitivity and label&#8208;free detection of surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) sensors is expected to achieve real&#8208;time diagnosis in home medical care. However, the surface of SERS sensors is susceptible to biofouling and inactivation by biological impurities in tears, resulting in rapid degradation of sensitivity, limiting the commercialization of point&#8208;of&#8208;care devices. Herein, a binary nanosphere array with dual properties is constructed as a separation&#8208;sensing platform for the diagnosis of target molecules in tears. The upper part of the structure is composed of Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) and a sputtering Au layer, which can bind the target molecules that interact with Au and provide high&#8208;strength and high&#8208;density SERS hotspots. The lower half is an inactive SiO2 nanosphere array with periodic large pores that allows biological impurities to penetrate the lower part and be separated from the target analyte. Furthermore, this substrate was integrated into homemade tear kits, enabling simultaneous tear collection, pre&#8208;separation, and detection. Combined with the Raman spectra of tears and LDA analysis, we successfully identified patients with jaundice in clinics. This platform is expected to provide an opportunity for early disease screening based on biological fluids.

         <title>Hydrogen Production and Water Desalination with On&#8208;demand Electricity Output Enabled by Electrochemical Neutralization Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical neutralization chemistry strategy that couples acidic hydrogen evolution and alkaline hydrazine oxidation with ionic exchange enables utilization of the chemical energy and low&#8208;grade heat from the surroundings for hydrogen production with electricity output.







Abstract
Energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production can be achieved by using renewables or decoupling the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction from overall water splitting, which still needs electricity input. We have realized hydrogen production and water desalination with on&#8208;demand electricity output via an electrochemical neutralization chemistry strategy that couples acidic hydrogen evolution and alkaline hydrazine oxidation with ionic exchange. The electrochemical neutralization cells allow efficient use of chemical energy and low&#8208;grade heat from the surroundings to output 0.81&#8197;kWh electricity per m3 of hydrogen. Cell function can be rapidly switched to electricity output with a high peak power density up to 85.5&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 or spontaneous hydrogen production at a high rate up to 70.1&#8197;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2 without breaking cell operation or changing cell configuration. Fast water desalination is simultaneously achieved at a high salt removal rate of 56.1&#8197;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2 without an external electricity supply.

         <title>Rational Electrolyte Design toward Cyclability Remedy for Room&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;fluorinated electrolyte is demonstrated to enable a quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;phase conversion via controllable nucleophilic reactions to improve the performance of room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur batteries. The fluorinated ether as anti&#8208;solvent further minimizes polysulfides solubility, and simultaneously stabilizes the Na anode. The as&#8208;developed batteries achieved high capacity, long lifespan, and enhanced safety.







Abstract
Rechargeable room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT Na&#8211;S) batteries are a promising energy storage technology, owing to the merits of high energy density and low cost. However, their electrochemical performance has been severely hindered by the poor compatibility between the existing electrolytes and the electrodes. Here, we demonstrate that an all&#8208;fluorinated electrolyte, containing 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (FDMA) solvent, 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl methyl ether (MTFE) anti&#8208;solvent and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) additive, can greatly enhance the reversibility and cyclability of RT Na&#8211;S batteries. A NaF&#8208; and Na3N&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase derived from FDMA and FEC enables a &#8220;quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;phase&#8221; Na&#8211;S conversion, eliminating the shuttle of polysulfides. The MTFE not only reduces polysulfide dissolution, but also further stabilizes the Na anode via a tailored solvation structure. The as&#8208;developed RT Na&#8211;S batteries deliver a high capacity, long lifespan, and enhanced safety.

         <title>Photouncaging of Carboxylic Acids from Cyanine Dyes with Near&#8208;Infrared Light
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocages based on cyanine dyes that are accessible on multigram scale enable the efficient delivery and release of carboxylic acids in live cells using tissue&#8208;penetrating near&#8208;infrared light. The photouncaging process was examined by using several techniques, with the findings suggesting a photooxidative pathway.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared light (NIR; 650&#8211;900&#8197;nm) offers unparalleled advantages as a biocompatible stimulus. The development of photocages that operate in this region represents a fundamental challenge due to the low energy of the excitation light. Herein, we repurpose cyanine dyes into photocages that are available on a multigram scale in three steps and efficiently release carboxylic acids in aqueous media upon irradiation with NIR light up to 820&#8197;nm. The photouncaging process is examined using several techniques, providing evidence that it proceeds via photooxidative pathway. We demonstrate the practical utility in live HeLa cells by delivery and release of the carboxylic acid cargo, that was otherwise not uptaken by cells in its free form. In combination with modularity of the cyanine scaffold, the realization of these accessible photocages will fully unleash the potential of the emerging field of NIR&#8208;photoactivation and facilitate its widespread adoption outside the photochemistry community.

         <title>Chemiluminescent Probes with Long&#8208;Lasting High Brightness for In Vivo Imaging of Neutrophils</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrabright activatable chemiluminescent probes were synthesized which were equipped with intramolecular hydrogen bonding to prolong their half&#8208;lives for in vivo imaging of neutrophils in peritonitis and psoriasis mouse models.







Abstract
Real&#8208;time optical imaging of immune cells can contribute to understanding their pathophysiological roles, which still remains challenging. Current sensitive chemiluminophores have issues of short half&#8208;lives and low brightness, limiting their ability for in vivo longitudinal monitoring of immunological processes. To tackle these issues, we report benzoazole&#8208;phenoxyl&#8208;dioxetane (BAPD)&#8208;based chemiluminophores with intramolecular hydrogen bonding for in vivo imaging of neutrophils. Compared with the classical counterpart, chemiluminescence half&#8208;lives and brightness of BAPDs in the aqueous solution are increased by &#8764; 33&#8208; and 8.2&#8208;fold, respectively. Based on the BAPD scaffold, a neutrophil elastase&#8208;responsive chemiluminescent probe is developed for real&#8208;time imaging of neutrophils in peritonitis and psoriasis mouse models. Our study provides an intramolecular hydrogen bonding molecular design for improving the performance of chemiluminophores in advanced imaging applications.

         <title>Controlling the Structure, Properties and Surface Reactivity of Clickable Azide&#8208;Functionalized Au25(SR)18 Nanocluster Platforms Through Regioisomeric Ligand Modifications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The correlational properties of regioisomeric, azide&#8208;functionalized Au25(SR)18 nanoclusters have been explored, and the molecular structures of the neutral forms of these clusters have been obtained. Although the optical properties are similar, alterations to electrochemical profiles and cluster&#8211;surface reactivity with a strained&#8208;alkyne have been observed that appear to change as the position of the surface azido moiety is changed.







Abstract
To fine&#8208;tune structure&#8211;property correlations of thiolate&#8208;protected gold nanoclusters through post&#8208;assembly surface modifications, we report the synthesis of the o, m, and p regioisomeric forms of the anionic azide&#8208;functionalized [Au25(SCH2CH2&#8208;C6H4&#8208;N3)18]1&#8722; platform. They can undergo cluster&#8211;surface strain&#8208;promoted alkyne&#8211;azide cycloaddition (CS&#8208;SPAAC) chemistry with complementary strained&#8208;alkynes. Although their optical properties are similar, the electrochemical properties appear to correlate with the position of the azido group. The ability to conduct CS&#8208;SPAAC chemistry without altering the parent nanocluster structure is different as the isomeric form of the surface ligand is changed, with the [Au25(SCH2CH2&#8208;p&#8208;C6H4&#8208;N3)18]1&#8722; isomer having the highest reaction rates, while the [Au25(SCH2CH2&#8208;o&#8208;C6H4&#8208;N3)18]1&#8722; isomer is not stable following CS&#8208;SPAAC. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction provide the molecular structure of the neutral forms of the three regioisomeric clusters, [Au25(SCH2CH2&#8208;o/m/p&#8208;C6H4&#8208;N3]0, which illustrates correlated structural features of the central core as the position of the azido moiety is changed.

They can undergo cluster&#8211;surface strain-promoted alkyne&#8211;azide cycloaddition (&lt;i&gt;CS&lt;/i&gt;-SPAAC) chemistry with complementary strained-alkynes. Although their optical properties are similar, the electrochemical properties appear to correlate with the position of the azido group. The ability to conduct &lt;i&gt;CS&lt;/i&gt;-SPAAC chemistry without altering the parent nanocluster structure is different as the isomeric form of the surface ligand is changed, with the [Au&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;(SCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;1&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; isomer having the highest reaction rates, while the [Au&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;(SCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;1&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; isomer is not stable following &lt;i&gt;CS&lt;/i&gt;-SPAAC. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction provide the molecular structure of the neutral forms of the three regioisomeric clusters, [Au&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;(SCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, which illustrates correlated structural features of the central core as the position of the azido moiety is changed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Natural Lindenane Sesquiterpenoid Oligomers via a Triene as a Potential Biosynthetic Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conjugated triene was evidenced as a universal synthetic and biosynthetic intermediate toward various natural lindenane oligomers under simulated physiological conditions with high stereoselectivity. The related oligomerization modes involve linear connection, head&#8208;to&#8208;head [4+2] cycloaddition, head&#8208;to&#8208;tail [4+2] cycloaddition, head&#8208;to&#8208;back [4+2] cycloaddition, and head&#8208;to&#8208;tail [6+6] cycloaddition.







Abstract
A previously proposed triene of the lindenane skeleton was synthesized, characterized, and identified as the common intermediate for the non&#8208;enzymatic synthesis of natural lindenane oligomers through linear, [4+2]&#8208;type and [6+6]&#8208;type homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208; dimerization under simulated physiological conditions. As a result, the following six natural products were successfully synthesized through thermal head&#8208;to&#8208;head, head&#8208;to&#8208;tail, and head&#8208;to&#8208;back binding modes: shizukaols&#8197;A and J, cycloshizukaol&#8197;A, chlorahupetone&#8197;F, chlotrichene&#8197;B, and trishizukaol&#8197;A.

         <title>Spectroscopic Fingerprints of Cavity Formation and Solute Insertion as a Measure of Hydration Entropic Loss and Enthalpic Gain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dissecting hydration entropy and enthalpy into hydrophobic and hydrophilic contributions from &#8220;wrap&#8221; and &#8220;bound&#8221; spectroscopic fingerprints in the low frequency THz range is reported. In the future, this THz&#8208;calorimetry decomposition method could be broadly applied to uncover local hydration thermodynamics, e.g. in molecular recognition.







Abstract
Hydration free energies are dictated by a subtle balance of hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions. We present here a spectroscopic approach, which gives direct access to the two main contributions: Using THz&#8208;spectroscopy to probe the frequency range of the intermolecular stretch (150&#8211;200&#8197;cm&#8722;1) and the hindered rotations (450&#8211;600&#8197;cm&#8722;1), the local contributions due to cavity formation and hydrophilic interactions can be traced back. We show that via THz calorimetry these fingerprints can be correlated 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 with the group specific solvation entropy and enthalpy. This allows to deduce separately the hydrophobic (i.e. cavity formation) and hydrophilic contributions to thermodynamics, as shown for hydrated alcohols as a case study. Accompanying molecular dynamics simulations quantitatively support our experimental results. In the future our approach will allow to dissect hydration contributions in inhomogeneous mixtures and under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions.

         <title>Production of C3&#8211;C6 Acetate Esters via CO Electroreduction in a Membrane Electrode Assembly Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The production of C3&#8211;C6 acetate esters from the electrocatalytic reduction of carbon monoxide in a membrane electrode assembly cell is reported. The near water&#8208;free reaction conditions and the high local pH played key roles in the formation of the esters. Acetate esters could be produced with an unprecedented Faradaic efficiency of &#8764;22&#8201;% and with a current density of up to &#8722;55&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic carbon monoxide reduction has been previously reported to yield a range of carbonaceous products including alcohols, hydrocarbons and carboxylic acids. However, esters, an important family of organic compounds, have not been formed. Herein, we report the electrosynthesis of C3 to C6 acetate esters (H3C&#8722;(C=O)&#8722;O&#8722;R) from carbon monoxide using copper catalysts in a membrane electrode assembly cell. Ethyl acetate and propyl acetate could be produced with an unprecedented total Faradaic efficiency (FE) of &#8764;22&#8201;% and with a current density of up to &#8722;55&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, alongside minor quantities of methyl acetate and butyl acetate. The esters are produced via the addition reaction of ethenone (H2C=C=O) and alcohols produced during CO reduction. We show that the near water&#8208;free reaction conditions and the high local pH play key roles in the formation of the esters.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Atropisomeric Biaryl Phosphorus Compounds by Chiral&#8208;Phosphonium&#8208;Salt&#8208;Enabled Cascade Arene Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective organocatalytic cascade process has been developed for the synthesis of axially chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;biaryl phosphorus compounds. The approach involves multistep arene formation promoted by multifunctional phosphonium salt catalysis and proceeds through a complex Thorpe&#8208;type cycloaddition/oxidative hydroxylation/aromatization cascade with central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer.







Abstract
Axially chiral biaryl monophosphorus molecules, exemplified by atropisomeric 1,1&#8242;&#8208;biaryl aminophosphines, are significant motifs in numerous chiral ligands/catalysts. Developing efficient methods for preparing phosphorus compounds with these privileged motifs is an important endeavor in synthetic chemistry. Herein, we develop an effective, modular method by a chiral&#8208;phosphonium&#8208;salt&#8208;catalyzed novel cascade between phosphorus&#8208;containing nitroolefins and &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dicyanoolefins, leading to a great diversity of atropisomeric biaryls bearing phosphorus groups in high yields with excellent stereoselectivities. The reaction features include a Thorpe&#8208;type cycloaddition/oxidative hydroxylation/aromatization cascade pathway with a central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer process. Insight gained from our studies is expected to advance general efforts towards the catalytic synthesis of atropisomeric biaryl phosphorus compounds, offering a platform for developing new efficient chiral ligands and catalysts.

         <title>Fluorinating the Solid Electrolyte Interphase by Rational Molecular Design for Practical Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

Design principles of fluorinated molecules were proposed to construct a fluorinated solid electrolyte interphase for practical lithium&#8208;metal batteries.







Abstract
The lifespan of practical lithium (Li)&#8208;metal batteries is severely hindered by the instability of Li&#8208;metal anodes. Fluorinated solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) emerges as a promising strategy to improve the stability of Li&#8208;metal anodes. The rational design of fluorinated molecules is pivotal to construct fluorinated SEI. Herein, design principles of fluorinated molecules are proposed. Fluoroalkyl (&#8722;CF2CF2&#8722;) is selected as an enriched F reservoir and the defluorination of the C&#8722;F bond is driven by leaving groups on &#946;&#8208;sites. An activated fluoroalkyl molecule (AFA), 2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluorobutane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol dinitrate is unprecedentedly proposed to render fast and complete defluorination and generate uniform fluorinated SEI on Li&#8208;metal anodes. In Li&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries under practical conditions, the fluorinated SEI constructed by AFA undergoes 183&#8197;cycles, which is three times the SEI formed by LiNO3. Furthermore, a Li&#8722;S pouch cell of 360&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 delivers 25&#8197;cycles with AFA. This work demonstrates rational molecular design principles of fluorinated molecules to construct fluorinated SEI for practical Li&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>High&#8208;Voltage Organic Cathodes for Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries through Electron Cloud and Solvation Structure Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work explored the redox process of p&#8208;type organics and figured out the relationship between energy change and voltage output during this process. Based on the Nernst equation, a dual&#8208;step strategy to effectively tune the energy change of the redox process was proposed that improved the output voltage of organosulfur&#8208;based zinc&#8208;ion batteries from 0.8&#8197;V to 1.7&#8197;V.







Abstract
Redox&#8208;active organic materials, as a new generation of sustainable resources, are receiving increasing attention in zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) due to their resource abundance and tunable structure. However, organic molecules with high potential are rare, and the voltage of most reported organic cathode&#8208;based ZIBs is less than 1.2&#8197;V. Herein, we explored the redox process of p&#8208;type organics and figured out the relationship between energy change and voltage output during the process. Then, we proposed a dual&#8208;step strategy to effectively tune the energy change and eventually improve the output voltage of the organic electrode. Combining the regulation of the electron cloud of organic molecules and the manipulation of the solvation structure, the output voltage of an organosulfur compound based ZIB was greatly increased from 0.8&#8197;V to 1.7&#8197;V. Our results put forward a specific pathway to improve the working voltage and lay the foundation for the practical application of organic electrodes.

         <title>Dismutation of Tricyanoboryllead Compounds: The Homoleptic Tetrakis(tricyanoboryl)plumbate Tetraanion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tricyanoborylplumbate anions have been obtained and isolated as thermally robust salts. The tetrakis(tricyanoboryl)plumbate tetraanion [Pb{B(CN)3}4]4&#8722; was obtained from [EtPbB(CN)3]&#8722; by stepwise dismutation in water or hydrochloric acid via [Et2Pb{B(CN)3}2]2&#8722; and [EtPb{B(CN)3}3]3&#8722;.







Abstract
A series of unprecedently air&#8208;stable (tricyanoboryl)plumbate anions was obtained by the reaction of the boron&#8208;centered nucleophile B(CN)32&#8722; with triorganyllead halides. Salts of the anions [R3PbB(CN)3]&#8722; (R=Ph, Et) were isolated and found to be stable in air at room temperature. In the case of Me3PbHal (Hal=Cl, Br), a mixture of the anions [Me4&#8722;nPb{B(CN)3}n]n&#8722; (n=1, 2) was obtained. The [Et3PbB(CN)3]&#8722; ion undergoes stepwise dismutation in aqueous solution to yield the plumbate anions [Et4&#8722;nPb{B(CN)3}n]n&#8722; (n=1&#8211;4) and PbEt4 as by&#8208;product. The reaction rate increases with decreasing pH value of the aqueous solution or by bubbling O2 through the reaction mixture. Adjustment of the conditions allowed the selective formation and isolation of salts of all anions of the series [Et4&#8722;nPb{B(CN)3}n]n&#8722; (n=2&#8211;4) including the homoleptic tetraanion [Pb{B(CN)3}4]4&#8722;.

         <title>Investigation of the Molecular Landscape of Bacterial Aromatic Polyketides by Global Analysis of Type&#8197;II Polyketide Synthases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The global distribution and structural diversity of bacterial aromatic polyketides were assessed by pan&#8208;genomic analysis of type&#8197;II polyketide synthases. Such a global atlas will guide genome mining efforts to fully exploit natural products, as exemplified by the discovery of the unusual angular naphthopyrans from a rare actinobacterium.







Abstract
Aromatic polyketides biosynthesized by microorganisms are a prominent class of natural products widely used in clinical treatments. Although genome mining approaches have accelerated the discovery of these molecules, the molecular diversity, abundance, and distribution of bacterial aromatic polyketides at a global scale remain elusive. Here, we provide a global atlas of bacterial aromatic polyketides based on large&#8208;scale analysis of type&#8197;II polyketide synthases. We first established the chain length factor protein as a marker that can predict both chemical class and molecular uniqueness of the biosynthetic product, and analyzed the abundance, taxonomic distribution, estimated structural diversity, and the total number of aromatic polyketides in bacteria. We further show the identification of oryzanaphthopyrans with an unprecedented angular naphthopyran scaffold from a rare actinobacterium by genome mining guided by the global atlas. These results serve as a compass for exploiting the entire type&#8197;II polyketide synthase&#8208;derived aromatic polyketides in bacteria.

         <title>Ruthenium Olefin Metathesis Catalysts Bearing a Macrocyclic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Ligand: Improved Stability and Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
New Grubbs&#8208;type complexe containing macrocyclic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand with two small aryl arms tied together was obtained and characterised. Interestingly, it can exist in two forms, cis and trans. Both of them exhibit similarly high thermodynamic stability, yet different application profiles in catalysis, however both can be used in difficult metathesis reactions, also leading to the formation of tetrasubstituted double bonds.

Formation of sterically hindered C&#8722;C double bonds via catalytic olefin metathesis is considered a very challenging task for Ru catalysts. This limitation led to the development of specialised catalysts bearing sterically reduced N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands that are very active in such transformations, yet significantly less stable as compared to general purpose catalysts. To decrease the small&#8208;size NHC catalysts susceptibility to decomposition, a new NHC ligand was designed, in which two sterically reduced aryl arms were tied together by a C&#8208;8 alkyl chain. The installation of this macrocyclic ligand on the ruthenium centre led to the formation of an olefin metathesis catalyst (trans&#8208;Ru6). Interestingly, this complex undergoes transformation into an isomer bearing two Cl ligands in the cis&#8208;arrangement (cis&#8208;Ru6). These two isomeric complexes exhibit similarly high thermodynamic stability, yet different application profiles in catalysis.

         <title>Anionic Cyanine J&#8208;Type Aggregate Nanoparticles with Enhanced Photosensitization for Mitochondria&#8208;Targeting Tumor Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, anionic cyanines are designed as the phototherapy agents by controlling their aggregates through counterion engineering. The resulting J&#8208;type aggregate nanoparticles show NIR emission, high photostability, negatively charge surface, mitochondria&#8208;targeting ability, and significantly enhanced singlet oxygen generation efficiency, leading to efficient antitumor phototherapy efficacy.







Abstract
Cyanines have been widely used as the photosensitizers (PSs) in the biomedical field, but controlling their molecular aggregates in nanoparticles (NPs) remains a major challenge. Moreover, the impact of aggregate behaviors of cyanines on the photosensitization is still unclear. Herein, the first anionic cyanine PSs based on a tricyanofuran end group have been designed by achieving supramolecular J&#8208;type aggregates in NPs via counterion engineering. Our results indicate that J&#8208;type aggregates in NPs can not only bring significantly red&#8208;shifted emission, negatively charged surface, and high photostability, but also enable a significant 5&#8208;fold increase in singlet oxygen generation efficiency compared to that in the nonaggregate state, providing strong experimental evidence for the superiority of J&#8208;aggregates in enhancing photosensitization. Thus, combined with the mitochondria&#8208;targeting ability, the J&#8208;type aggregate NPs show remarkable in vivo antitumor phototheranostic efficacy, making them have a potential for clinical use.

         <title>Catalytic DNA Polymerization Can Be Expedited by Active Product Release
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rate of the primer exchange reaction is a strongly peaked function of the binding strength between the reactant and catalyst strands. This trend holds for many catalytic reactions and is known as Sabatier's principle. A helicase that consumes ATP to selectively remove the products from the catalysts can speed up the reaction in the strong&#8208;binding regime and reduce the dependency of the catalytic rate on the binding strength.







Abstract
The sequence&#8208;specific hybridization of DNA facilitates its use as a building block for designer nanoscale structures and reaction networks that perform computations. However, the strong binding energy of Watson&#8211;Crick base pairing that underlies this specificity also causes the DNA dehybridization rate to depend sensitively on sequence length and temperature. This strong dependency imposes stringent constraints on the design of multi&#8208;step DNA reactions. Here we show how an ATP&#8208;dependent helicase, Rep&#8208;X, can drive specific dehybridization reactions at rates independent of sequence length, removing the constraints of equilibrium on DNA hybridization and dehybridization. To illustrate how this new capacity can speed up designed DNA reaction networks, we show that Rep&#8208;X extends the range of conditions where the primer exchange reaction, which catalytically adds a domain provided by a hairpin template to a DNA substrate, proceeds rapidly.

         <title>Inorganic Chiral Hybrid Nanostructures for Tailored Chiroptics and Chirality&#8208;Dependent Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of chiral hybrid nanostructures comprising chiral plasmonic nanoparticles and functional semiconductors are constructed via a general synthesis. The obtained hybrids show new and tunable chiroptical activity, and exhibit chirality&#8208;dependent photocatalytic performance of water splitting under circularly polarized light, paving the way for complex chiral nanostructures and new chiral light&#8211;matter interactions.







Abstract
Inorganic chiral hybrid nanostructures that embed chirality within distinct material compositions can create novel chiral properties and functionalities absent from achiral nanostructures; however, they remain largely unexplored. We report, for the first time, a class of chiral plasmonic metal&#8208;semiconductor core&#8208;shell nanostructures that employ structurally chiral nanoparticles as chirality inducing templates to grow functional shell materials, which allowed us to independently control material parameters such as core geometry and shell thickness, as well as handedness of the system. We experimentally and theoretically achieved enhanced and tunable chiroptical activity of the heterostructures as a result of the core&#8208;shell strong coupling effect. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, we demonstrate that the chiral hybrid nanostructures can drive chirality&#8208;dependent photocatalytic hydrogen generation under circularly polarized light. This study enables rational design and functionalization of chiral hybrid nanomaterials towards enhanced chiral light&#8211;matter interactions and chiral device applications.

         <title>Sustained Release of a Synthetic Autoinducing Peptide Mimetic Blocks Bacterial Communication and Virulence In Vivo.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic peptide was found to block cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell signalling, or quorum sensing, in bacteria and be highly bioavailable in mouse tissue. The controlled release of this agent from degradable polymeric microparticles strongly inhibited skin infection in a wound model at levels that far surpassed the potency of the peptide when delivered conventionally.







Abstract
There is significant interest in approaches to the treatment of bacterial infections that block virulence without creating selective pressures that lead to resistance. Here, we report the development of an &#8220;anti&#8208;virulence&#8221; strategy that exploits the activity of potent synthetic inhibitors of quorum sensing (QS) in Staphylococcus aureus. We identify peptide&#8208;based inhibitors of QS that are resistant to sequestration or degradation by components of murine tissue and demonstrate that encapsulation of a lead inhibitor in degradable polymer microparticles provides materials that substantially inhibit QS in vitro. Using a murine abscess model, we show that this inhibitor attenuates methicillin&#8208;resistant S. aureus (MRSA) skin infections in vivo, and that sustained release of the inhibitor from microparticles significantly improved outcomes compared to mice that received a single&#8208;dose bolus. Our results present an effective and modular approach to controlling bacterial virulence in vivo and could advance the development of new strategies for skin infection control.

Lewis pair polymerization has demonstrated its unique advantages and powerful capability in polymer synthesis. Here we employ strong nucleophilic N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin (NHO) and bulky organoaluminum to construct a frustrated Lewis pair, which can realize the compounded sequence control (CSC) copolymerization and self&#8208;assembly the mixture of dimethylaminoethyl acrylate and fluoride&#8208;functionalized methacrylate into diblock copolymers (di&#8208;BCPs) nano&#8208;assemblies through polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly in one&#8208;pot, single&#8208;step manner within minutes. These di&#8208;BCPs were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR, GPC, DSC, and TEM. By utilizing appropriate solvophilic block and solvophobic block, such Lewis pair polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly strategy enables the expeditious, room&#8208;temperature synthesis of di&#8208;BCP nanoparticles with different morphologies, including spheres, worms, vesicles, and even fibers, thus suggesting the great application potential of such method in the future.

         <title>Highly Chemoselective Transamidation of Unactivated Tertiary Amides by Electrophilic N&#8722;C(O) Activation by Amide&#8208;to&#8208;Acyl Iodide Re&#8208;routing</title>

         <dc:description>
The challenging transamidation of unactivated tertiary amides using equivalent amounts of amines has been accomplished via cooperative acid/iodide catalysis. The method provides a novel manifold to re&#8208;route the reactivity of unactivated and unreactive N,N&#8208;dialkyl amides through reactive acyl iodide intermediates, representing a powerful new activation mode of unactivated amide bonds.







Abstract
The challenging transamidation of unactivated tertiary amides has been accomplished via cooperative acid/iodide catalysis. Most crucially, the method provides a novel manifold to re&#8208;route the reactivity of unactivated N,N&#8208;dialkyl amides through reactive acyl iodide intermediates, thus reverting the classical order of reactivity of carboxylic acid derivatives. This method provides a direct route to amide&#8208;to&#8208;amide bond interconversion with excellent chemoselectivity using equivalent amounts of amines. The combination of acid and iodide has been identified as the essential factor to activate the amide C&#8722;N bond through electrophilic catalytic activation, enabling the production of new desired transamidated products with wide substrate scope of both unactivated amides and amines, including late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex APIs (&gt;80&#8197;examples). We anticipate that this powerful activation mode of unactivated amide bonds will find broad&#8208;ranging applications in chemical synthesis.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of [3]&#8208;Ladderanol through Late&#8208;Stage Organocatalytic Desymmetrization
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective desymmetrization route to [3]&#8208;ladderanol has been devised that is centered around an organocatalytic enantioselective formal C(sp2)&#8722;H alkylation of tetracyclic meso&#8208;cyclohexenedione. This strategy involving the late&#8208;stage introduction of chirality offers flexibility and enabled the facile synthesis of both enantiomers of [3]&#8208;ladderanol as well as an analogue.







Abstract
Ladderane phospholipids, with their unusual ladder&#8208;like arrangement of concatenated cyclobutane rings, represent an architecturally unique class of natural products. However, despite their fascinating structure and other necessary impetus, only a few synthetic studies of these molecules have been reported so far. We have now devised a concise total synthesis of [3]&#8208;ladderanol, a component of natural ladderane phospholipids, using an organocatalytic enantioselective desymmetrizing formal C(sp2)&#8722;H alkylation. Our synthetic strategy rests on the late&#8208;stage introduction of chirality, thus allowing facile access to both enantiomers of [3]&#8208;ladderanol as well as an analogue. This is the first time a desymmetrization strategy is applied to the synthesis of [3]&#8208;ladderanol. The scope of this desymmetrizing C(sp2)&#8722;H alkylation of meso&#8208;cyclobutane&#8208;fused cyclohexenediones is also presented.

The use of strained bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanyl alcohols (BCP&#8722;OH) for the synthesis of a library of cyclobutanone and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;enone scaffolds through palladium&#8208;catalyzed chemoselective C&#8722;C activation is described. Both experimental and DFT studies provided insights into the crucial stabilizing effect of base additives on the palladium&#8208;carbon intermediates.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed chemoselective coupling of readily available bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanyl alcohols (BCP&#8722;OH) with various halides is reported, which offers expedient approaches to a wide range of cyclobutanone and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;enone skeletons via single or double C&#8722;C activation. The chemistry shows a broad substrate scope in terms of both the range of BCP&#8722;OH and halides including a series of natural product derivatives. Moreover, dependency of reaction chemodivergence on base additive has been investigated through experimental and density functional theory (DFT) studies, which is expected to significantly enrich the reaction modes and increase the synthetic potential of BCP&#8722;OH in preparing more complex molecules.

         <title>Photocatalytic Abstraction of Hydrogen Atoms from Water Using Hydroxylated Graphitic Carbon Nitride for Hydrogenative Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using water as hydrogen donor is very challenging for hydrogen atom transfer reaction. Compared with gCN, the surface hydroxylated graphitic carbon nitride (gCN&#8722;OH) shows the activation of H&#8722;O bonds in water under visible light irradiation, thus rendering water as hydrogen donor for multiple reductions involving a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) step and the oxidation of water to H2O2.







Abstract
Employing pure water, the ultimate green source of hydrogen donor to initiate chemical reactions that involve a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) step is fascinating but challenging due to its large H&#8722;O bond dissociation energy (BDEH&#8208;O=5.1&#8197;eV). Many approaches have been explored to stimulate water for hydrogenative reactions, but the efficiency and productivity still require significant enhancement. Here, we show that the surface hydroxylated graphitic carbon nitride (gCN&#8722;OH) only requires 2.25&#8197;eV to activate H&#8722;O bonds in water, enabling abstraction of hydrogen atoms via dehydrogenation of pure water into hydrogen peroxide under visible light irradiation. The gCN&#8722;OH presents a stable catalytic performance for hydrogenative N&#8722;N coupling, pinacol&#8208;type coupling and dehalogenative C&#8722;C coupling, all with high yield and efficiency, even under solar radiation, featuring extensive impacts in using renewable energy for a cleaner process in dye, electronic, and pharmaceutical industries.

         <title>Hydrophobization Engineering of the Air&#8211;Cathode Catalyst for Improved Oxygen Diffusion towards Efficient Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bionic&#8208;inspired hydrophobization engineering of electrocatalysts is developed to enable the formation of more three&#8208;phase reaction interfaces and promoted oxygen diffusion on an air cathode, achieving enhanced electrocatalytic efficiency toward zinc&#8211;air battery with higher energy density in comparison with that employing the air cathode without hydrophobic surface design.







Abstract
Poor oxygen diffusion at multiphase interfaces in an air cathode suppresses the energy densities of zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs). Developing effective strategies to tackle the issue is of great significance for overcoming the performance bottleneck. Herein, inspired by the bionics of diving flies, a polytetrafluoroethylene layer was coated on the surfaces of Co3O4 nanosheets (NSs) grown on carbon cloth (CC) to create a hydrophobic surface to enable the formation of more three&#8208;phase reaction interfaces and promoted oxygen diffusion, rendering the hydrophobic&#8208;Co3O4 NSs/CC electrode a higher limiting current density (214&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.3&#8197;V) than that (10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) of untreated&#8208;Co3O4 NSs/CC electrode. Consequently, the assembled ZAB employing hydrophobic&#8208;Co3O4 NSs/CC cathode acquired a higher power density (171&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) than that (102&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) utilizing untreated&#8208;Co3O4 NSs/CC cathode, proving the enhanced interfacial reaction kinetics on air cathode benefiting from the hydrophobization engineering.

         <title>Extended Conjugation Attenuates the Quenching of Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emitters by Photocyclization Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions to shorten and lengthen the conjugation between oligoaryl alkene units of aggregation&#8208;induced emitters toggle between rapid photocyclization and efficient photoluminescence properties. Trienes are resistant to photocyclization, giving them higher photoluminescence quantum yields, whereas nonconjugated aryl alkene units cyclize readily to form extended polycyclic frameworks.







Abstract
Herein, we expose how the antagonistic relationship between solid&#8208;state luminescence and photocyclization of oligoaryl alkene chromophores is modulated by the conjugation length of their alkenyl backbones. Heptaaryl cycloheptatriene molecular rotors exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristics. We show that their emission is turned off upon breaking the conjugation of the cycloheptatriene by epoxide formation. While this modification is deleterious to photoluminescence, it enables formation of extended polycyclic frameworks by Mallory reactions. We exploit this dichotomy (i) to manipulate emission properties in a controlled manner and (ii) as a synthetic tool to link together pairs of phenyl rings in a specific sequence. This method to alter the tendency of oligoaryl alkenes to undergo photocyclization can inform the design of solid&#8208;state emitters that avoid this quenching mechanism, while also allowing selective cyclization in syntheses of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

         <title>Direct Amination of Benzene with Molecular Nitrogen Enabled by Plasma&#8208;Liquid Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular N2 was directly fixed into arylamines in a plasma&#8211;liquid system at ambient temperature and pressure without transition metal mediation, which provides a green alternative to the hazardous multistep processes as practiced in the traditional method for large&#8208;scale arylamine production.







Abstract
Nitrogen fixation is industrially realized by mass production of ammonia, the principal intermediate nitrogen source for N&#8208;containing organic molecules. Instead, direct C&#8722;N bond formation from dinitrogen (N2) is of great interest but remains a challenge. Here, by virtue of unique plasma&#8211;liquid interactions, we developed an environmentally benign one&#8208;pot approach to directly couple benzene and N2, two naturally abundant yet chemically inert molecules, into value&#8208;added arylamines. Under the optimal conditions, an amination yield of 45&#8201;% was rapidly achieved, far better than the reported benzene amination efficiency using ammonia. A tentative reaction mechanism was proposed involving the long&#8208;lived N2 (A3
) and N2+ species, as evidenced by the key intermediates detected. With a deeper mechanistic understanding and by further optimizing the plasma reactor, the realization of cost&#8208;effective electrical amination of benzene with N2 could become reality.

         <title>Activatable Persistent Luminescence from Porphyrin Derivatives and Supramolecular Probes with Imaging&#8208;Modality Transformable Characteristics for Improved Biological Applications
</title>

Porphyrin derivatives that can emit near&#8208;infrared persistent luminescence (PL) over 60&#8197;min are reported and a mechanism for the phenomenon is proposed. The derivatives are used to synthesize supramolecular probes with peroxynitrite&#8208;activated PL and light&#8208;triggered imaging&#8208;modality transformation characteristics that permit improved biological uses.







Abstract
Persistent luminescence without excitation light and tissue autofluorescence interference holds great promise for biological applications, but is limited by available materials with long&#8208;wavelength emission and excellent clinical potential. Here, we report that porphyrin derivatives can emit near&#8208;infrared persistent luminescence over 60&#8197;min after cessation of excitation light or on interaction with peroxynitrite. A plausible mechanism of the successive oxidation of vinylene bonds was demonstrated. A supramolecular probe with a &#946;&#8208;sheet structure was constructed to enhance the tumor targeting ability and the photoacoustic and persistent luminescence signals. Such probes featuring light&#8208;triggered function transformation from photoacoustic imaging to persistent luminescence imaging permit advanced image&#8208;guided cancer surgery. Furthermore, peroxynitrite&#8208;activated persistent luminescence of the supramolecular probe also enables rapid and precise screening of immunogenic cell death drugs.

         <title>Tuning an Imine Reductase for the Asymmetric Synthesis of Azacycloalkylamines by Concise Structure&#8208;Guided Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure&#8208;guided engineering of an imine reductase IR&#8208;G36 gave a final variant M5 for reductive amination, enabling the asymmetric synthesis of a series of azacycloalkylamines with up to 47&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 substrate loadings and up to 99&#8201;% conversion and &gt;99&#8201;% ee. Crystal structures of IR&#8208;G36 and computational studies shed light on the structural basis for the performance improvement.







Abstract
Although imine reductases (IREDs) are emerging as attractive reductive aminases (RedAms), their substrate scope is still narrow, and rational engineering is rare. Focusing on hydrogen bond reorganization and cavity expansion, a concise strategy combining rational cavity design, combinatorial active&#8208;site saturation test (CAST), and thermostability engineering was designed, that transformed the weakly active IR&#8208;G36 into a variant M5 with superior performance for the synthesis of (R)&#8208;3&#8208;benzylamino&#8208;1&#8208;Boc&#8208;piperidine, with a 4193&#8208;fold improvement in catalytic efficiency, a 16.2&#8201;&#176;C improvement in Tm, and a significant increase in the e.e. value from 78&#8201;% (R) to &gt;99&#8201;% (R). M5 exhibits broad substrate scope for the synthesis of diverse azacycloalkylamines, and the reaction was demonstrated on a hectogram&#8208;scale under industrially relevant conditions. Our study provides a compelling example of the preparation of versatile and efficient IREDs, with exciting opportunities in medicinal and process chemistry as well as synthetic biology.

Focusing on hydrogen bond reorganization and cavity expansion, a concise strategy combining rational cavity design, combinatorial active-site saturation test (CAST), and thermostability engineering was designed, that transformed the weakly active IR-G36 into a variant M5 with superior performance for the synthesis of (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-3-benzylamino-1-Boc-piperidine, with a 4193-fold improvement in catalytic efficiency, a 16.2&#8201;&#176;C improvement in &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, and a significant increase in the e.e. value from 78&#8201;% (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;) to &amp;gt;99&#8201;% (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;). M5 exhibits broad substrate scope for the synthesis of diverse azacycloalkylamines, and the reaction was demonstrated on a hectogram-scale under industrially relevant conditions. Our study provides a compelling example of the preparation of versatile and efficient IREDs, with exciting opportunities in medicinal and process chemistry as well as synthetic biology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sustaining Electron Transfer Pathways Extends Biohybrid Photoelectrode Stability to Years</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The viability of biohybrid technologies is primarily limited by the inherent fragility of the biological component. The operational stability of photoproteins adsorbed to mesoporous ITO electrodes is prolonged to 33&#8197;days under intense illumination, and 28&#8197;months in storage, demonstrating the feasibility of protein&#8208;based devices that last years.







Abstract
The exploitation of natural photosynthetic enzymes in semi&#8208;artificial devices constitutes an attractive and potentially sustainable route for the conversion of solar energy into electricity and solar fuels. However, the stability of photosynthetic proteins after incorporation in a biohybrid architecture typically limits the operational lifetime of biophotoelectrodes to a few hours. Here, we demonstrate ways to greatly enhance the stability of a mesoporous electrode coated with the RC&#8208;LH1 photoprotein from Rhodobacter sphaeroides. By preserving electron transfer pathways, we extended operation under continuous high&#8208;light to 33&#8197;days, and operation after storage to over two years. Coupled with large photocurrents that reached peak values of 4.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the optimized biophotoelectrode produced a cumulative output of 86&#8197;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the largest reported performance to date. Our results demonstrate that the factor limiting stability is the architecture surrounding the photoprotein, and that biohybrid sensors and photovoltaic devices with operational lifetimes of years are feasible.

         <title>Selective Extraction of Transition Metals from Spent LiNixCoyMn1&#8722;x&#8722;yO2 Cathode via Regulation of Coordination Environment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>

The deep eutectic solvent composed of choline chloride and oxalic acid was prepared. After leaching at 120&#8201;&#176;C for 10&#8197;hours, the nickel oxalate dihydrate and the filtrate containing other metal elements are separated. Then the filtrate is diluted with water to precipitate the cobalt oxalate dihydrate. Finally, manganese compounds were separated by adjusting pH.







Abstract
The complexity of chemical compounds in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) results in great difficulties in the extraction of multiple transition metals, which have similar physicochemical characteristics. Here, we propose a novel strategy for selective extraction of nickel, cobalt, and manganese from spent LiNixCoyMn1&#8722;x&#8722;yO2 (NCM) cathode through the regulation of coordination environment. Depending on adjusting the composition of ligand in transition metal complexes, a tandem leaching and separation system is designed and finally enables nickel, cobalt, and manganese to enrich in the form of NiO, Co3O4, and Mn3O4 with high recovery yields of 99.1&#8201;%, 95.1&#8201;%, and 95.3&#8201;%, respectively. We further confirm that the combination of different transition metals with well&#8208;designed ligands is the key to good selectivity. Through our work, fine&#8208;tuning the coordination environment of metal ions is proved to have great prospects in the battery recycling industry.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Adaptive Capillarity Enabling Densified 3D Printing for Ultra&#8208;High Areal and Volumetric Energy Density Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Innovative densified 3D printing enabled by a surface&#8208;adaptive capillarity strategy is proposed for fabrication of highly loaded supercapacitors. Coupling with controllable capillary densification, the printed symmetric supercapacitor delivers a double leap in areal and volumetric energy densities in both aqueous and organic electrolytes, a rarely achieved yet gravely desired attribute for 3D printed energy storage devices.







Abstract
Endowing supercapacitors with higher energy density is of great practical significance but remains extremely challenging. In this work, an innovative densified 3D printing enabled by a surface&#8208;adaptive capillarity strategy is proposed for the first time. The printable ink formulated with pyrrole surface&#8208;modified reduced graphene oxide renders the printed electrodes excellent surface tension regulability to the subsequent capillary densification, creating an intensely condensed electrode with well&#8208;maintained structural integrity. Furthermore, simultaneous in situ nitrogen doping and hierarchical micro&#8211;meso porosity are readily realized upon post&#8208;carbonization, encouraging enhanced capacitance and fast reaction dynamics. As a result, the printed symmetric supercapacitor delivers a double leap in areal and volumetric energy densities in both aqueous and organic electrolytes, a rarely achieved yet gravely desired attribute for 3D printed energy storage devices.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced Transmetalation between Copper and Palladium Nanoparticle Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The localized surface plasmon resonance effect of Cu nanoparticles enhances transmetalation and phenylacetylide intermediate transfer from the Cu surface to the Pd surface by low&#8208;flux visible light. This feature enables a choice between the cross&#8208;coupling product and homo&#8208;coupling product dependent on wavelength.







Abstract
Surface&#8208;plasmon&#8208;mediated phenylacetylide intermediate transfer from the Cu to the Pd surface affords a novel mechanism for transmetalation, enabling wavelength&#8208;tunable cross&#8208;coupling and homo&#8208;coupling reaction pathway control. C&#8722;C bond forming Sonogashira coupling and Glaser coupling reactions in O2 atmosphere are efficiently driven by visible light over heterogeneous Cu and Pd nanoparticles as a mixed catalyst without base or other additives. The reaction pathway can be controlled by switching the excitation wavelength. Shorter wavelengths (400&#8211;500&#8197;nm) give the Glaser homo&#8208;coupling diyne, whereas longer wavelength irradiation (500&#8211;940&#8197;nm) significantly increases the degree of cross&#8208;coupling Sonogashira coupling products. The ratio of the activated intermediates of alkyne to the iodobenzene is wavelength dependent and this regulates transmetalation. This wavelength&#8208;tunable reaction pathway is a novel way to optimize the product selectivity in important organic syntheses.

         <title>Enantio&#8208;, Diastereo&#8208; and Regioselective Synthesis of Chiral Cyclic and Acyclic gem&#8208;Difluoromethylenes by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed [4+2] Cycloaddition</title>

         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [4+2] cycloaddition between substituted&#8208;2&#8208;alkylidenetrimethylene carbonates and cyclic or acyclic gem&#8208;difluoroalkyl ketones enabled the synthesis of chiral gem&#8208;difluoromethylene compounds. A novel phosphoramidite ligand, which contains a bulky 1,1&#8208;dinaphthylmethanamino moiety, was the key to providing high yield products with excellent enantio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and regioselectivity.

gem&#8208;Difluoromethylene moieties are attractive in medicinal chemistry due to their ability to mimic other more ubiquitous functional groups. Thus, effective asymmetric methods for their construction are highly desirable, especially for the industrial production of chiral drugs. Using a Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [4+2] cycloaddition between substituted&#8208;2&#8208;alkylidenetrimethylene carbonates and gem&#8208;difluoroalkyl ketones, we were able to easily access chiral 1,3&#8208;dioxanes that contain a tetrasubstituted difluoroalkyl stereogenic center in cyclic and acyclic skeletons. A novel phosphoramidite ligand, which contains a bulky 1,1&#8208;dinaphthylmethanamino moiety, was developed to provide the products in high yield with excellent enantio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and regioselectivity. Strikingly, the gem&#8208;difluoro substitution pattern promotes the reaction, and pentafluoroethylketone, an &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorinated &#946;&#8208;ketoester, and a &#946;&#8208;ketosulfone are suitable substrates for this method.

         <title>Fusion of Multi&#8208;Resonance Fragment with Conventional Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon for Nearly BT.2020 Green Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through precise synthetic fusion of a multi&#8208;resonance fragment with a conventional polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), ultrapure green BN&#8208;ICz emitters were successfully constructed. The optimal bottom&#8208;emitting OLED exhibits a record&#8208;high CIEy value of 0.74 with a high EQE of 30.5&#8201;%. The top&#8208;emitting OLED not only achieves the BT.2020 green color (CIE: 0.17, 0.78), but also shows a leading performance with current efficiency up to 220&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1.







Abstract
Herein, we report a general strategy for achieving ultra&#8208;pure green emissions by suppressing the shoulder peaks in the emission spectra of conventional polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Through precise synthetic fusion of multi&#8208;resonance (MR) fragments with conventional PAH, extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation lengths, increased molecular rigidity, and reduced vibrational frequency could be simultaneously realized. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept emitters exhibited ultra&#8208;pure green emissions with dominant peaks at ca. 521&#8197;nm, photoluminescence quantum yields that are greater than 99&#8201;%, a small full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum of 23&#8197;nm, and CIE coordinates of (0.16, 0.77). The bottom&#8208;emitting organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) exhibited a record&#8208;high CIEy value of 0.74 and a high maximum external quantum efficiency of 30.5&#8201;%. The top&#8208;emitting OLED not only achieved a BT.2020 green color (CIE: 0.17, 0.78) for the first time but also showed superior performance among all green OLED devices, with a current efficiency of 220&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;.

         <title>Unprecedented Mushroom Polyketide Synthases Produce the Universal Anthraquinone Precursor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
(Pre&#8208;)Anthraquinones are a diverse class of bioactive natural products. Dissimilar to plants, molds, and bacteria, the webcaps, one of the most species&#8208;rich genera of mushrooms, use an evolutionarily distinct class of remarkably small polyketide synthases to produce atrochyrsone carboxylic acid, the universal precursor of (pre&#8208;)anthraquinones. These enzymes represent an outstanding example of convergent evolution of biosynthetic capacities.







Abstract
(Pre&#8208;)anthraquinones are widely distributed natural compounds and occur in plants, fungi, microorganisms, and animals, with atrochrysone (1) as the key biosynthetic precursor. Chemical analyses established mushrooms of the genus Cortinarius&#8212;the webcaps&#8212;as producers of atrochrysone&#8208;derived octaketide pigments. However, more recent genomic data did not provide any evidence for known atrochrysone carboxylic acid (4) synthases nor any other polyketide synthase (PKS) producing oligocyclic metabolites. Here, we describe an unprecedented class of non&#8208;reducing (NR&#8208;)PKS. In vitro assays with recombinant enzyme in combination with in vivo product formation in the heterologous host Aspergillus niger established CoPKS1 and CoPKS4 of C.&#160;odorifer as members of a new class of atrochrysone carboxylic acid synthases. CoPKS4 catalyzed both hepta&#8208; and octaketide synthesis and yielded 6&#8208;hydroxymusizin (6), along with 4. These first mushroom PKSs for oligocyclic products illustrate how the biosynthesis of bioactive natural metabolites evolved independently in various groups of life.

         <title>Digitizing Chemical Synthesis in 3D Printed Reactionware</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach to the digitization of organic synthesis that combines reactions as building blocks with 3D printed reactor hardware or reactionware is presented. This practical approach allows the synthetic chemist to encode the unit operations allowing a digital blueprint to be built of the entire process.







Abstract
Chemistry digitization requires an unambiguous link between experiments and the code used to generate the experimental conditions and outcomes, yet this process is not standardized, limiting the portability of any chemical code. What is needed is a universal approach to aid this process using a well&#8208;defined standard that is composed of syntheses that are employed in modular hardware. Herein we present a new approach to the digitization of organic synthesis that combines process chemistry principles with 3D printed reactionware. This approach outlines the process for transforming unit operations into digitized hardware and well&#8208;defined instructions that ensure effective synthesis. To demonstrate this, we outline the process for digitizing 3 MIDA boronate building blocks, an ester hydrolysis, a Wittig olefination, a Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reaction, and synthesis of the drug sulfanilamide.

         <title>Tandem Catalysis for Selective Oxidation of Methane to Oxygenates Using Oxygen over PdCu/Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
PdCu/zeolite exhibited promising catalytic performance for selective oxidation of CH4 to oxygenates with O2 and H2 via tandem catalysis. The PdO nanoparticles promoted the in situ generation of H2O2, while Cu single atoms activated the H2O2 and facilitated the direct conversion of CH4 to CH3OH by a radical&#8208;triggered pathway.







Abstract
Selective oxidation of methane to oxygenates with O2 under mild conditions remains a great challenge. Here we report a ZSM&#8208;5 (Z&#8208;5) supported PdCu bimetallic catalyst (PdCu/Z&#8208;5) for methane conversion to oxygenates by reacting with O2 in the presence of H2 at low temperature (120&#8201;&#176;C). Benefiting from the co&#8208;existence of PdO nanoparticles and Cu single atoms via tandem catalysis, the PdCu/Z&#8208;5 catalyst exhibited a high oxygenates yield of 1178&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1Pd&#8201;h&#8722;1 (mmol of oxygenates per gram Pd per hour) and at the same time high oxygenates selectivity of up to 95&#8201;%. Control experiments and mechanistic studies revealed that PdO nanoparticles promoted the in situ generation of H2O2 from O2 and H2, while Cu single atoms not only accelerated the activation of H2O2 for the generation of abundant hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) from H2O2 decomposition, but also enabled the homolytic cleavage of CH4 by &#8901;OH to methyl radicals (&#8901;CH3). Subsequently, the &#8901;OH reacted quickly with the &#8901;CH3 to form CH3OH with high selectivity.

&lt;sub&gt;Pd&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (mmol of oxygenates per gram Pd per hour) and at the same time high oxygenates selectivity of up to 95&#8201;%. Control experiments and mechanistic studies revealed that PdO nanoparticles promoted the in situ generation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, while Cu single atoms not only accelerated the activation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for the generation of abundant hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) from H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; decomposition, but also enabled the homolytic cleavage of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; by &#8901;OH to methyl radicals (&#8901;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Subsequently, the &#8901;OH reacted quickly with the &#8901;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to form CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH with high selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrocatalysis for Continuous Multi&#8208;Step Reactions in Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes Towards High&#8208;Energy and Long&#8208;Life Aluminum&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>

A quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Al&#8722;S battery is constructed with an electrocatalyst&#8208;assisted sulfur positive electrode and quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte. The electrocatalyst accelerates the sulfur conversion and the quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes inhibit the shuttle effect of polysulfide, endowing the Al&#8722;S battery with a high energy density and a long cycle life.







Abstract
Aluminum&#8211;sulfur (Al&#8722;S) batteries of ultrahigh energy&#8208;to&#8208;price ratios are a promising energy storage technology, while they suffer from a large voltage gap and short lifespan. Herein, we propose an electrocatalyst&#8208;boosting quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Al&#8722;S battery, which involves a sulfur&#8208;anchored cobalt/nitrogen co&#8208;doped graphene (S@CoNG) positive electrode and an ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;impregnated metal&#8211;organic framework (IL@MOF) electrolyte. The Co&#8722;N4 sites in CoNG continuously catalyze the breaking of Al&#8722;Cl and S&#8722;S bonds and accelerate the sulfur conversion, endowing the Al&#8722;S battery with a shortened voltage gap of 0.43&#8197;V and a high discharge voltage plateau of 0.9&#8197;V. In the quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state IL@MOF electrolytes, the shuttle effect of polysulfides has been inhibited, which stabilizes the reversible sulfur reaction, enabling the Al&#8722;S battery to deliver 820&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 specific capacity and 78&#8201;% capacity retention after 300&#8197;cycles. This finding offers novel insights to design Al&#8722;S batteries for stable energy storage.

         <title>A Bis&#8208;(carbone) Pincer Ligand and Its Coordinative Behavior toward Multi&#8208;Metallic Configurations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable bis&#8208;(carbone) pincer ligand was prepared and its structural characterization reported. With a total of five electron pairs available, this new pincer framework was studied for its coordinative behavior, enabling the formation of trinuclear heterometallic complexes.







Abstract
Carbones are divalent carbon(0) species that contain two lone pairs of electrons. Herein, we have prepared the first known stable and isolable free bis&#8208;(carbone) pincer framework with a well&#8208;defined solid&#8208;state structure. This bis&#8208;(carbone) ligand is an effective scaffold for forming monometallic (Ni and Pd) and trinuclear heterometallic complexes with Au&#8722;Pd&#8722;Au, Au&#8722;Ni&#8722;Au, and Cu&#8722;Ni&#8722;Cu configurations. Sophisticated quantum&#8208;theoretical analyses found that the metal&#8211;metal interactions are too weak to play a significant role in upholding these multi&#8208;metallic configurations; rather, the four lone pairs of electrons within the bis&#8208;(carbone) framework are the main contributors to the stability of the complexes.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Cycloisomerization/Cross&#8208;Coupling of Carbonyl&#8208; and Imine&#8208;Tethered Alkylidenecyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium catalytic system is reported for the divergent tandem cycloisomerization and cross&#8208;coupling of carbonyl&#8208; and imine&#8208;tethered alkylidenecyclopropanes (ACPs). The selection of ancillary ligands is pivotal for the interception of the heteropalladacyclic intermediates with different external nucleophiles.







Abstract
Pd0 catalysts featuring phosphorus&#8208;based monodentate ligands can detour the reactivity of carbonyl&#8208;tethered alkylidenecyclopropanes (ACPs) from standard (3+2) cycloadditions towards tandem cycloisomerization/cross&#8208;coupling processes. This new reactivity lies on the formation of key &#960;&#8208;allyl oxapalladacyclic intermediates, which are subsequently trapped with external nucleophilic partners, instead of undergoing canonical C&#8722;O reductive eliminations. Importantly, the use of imine&#8208;tethered ACP's is also feasible. Therefore, the method provides a straightforward and stereoselective entry to a wide variety of highly functionalized cyclic alcohols and amines.

         <title>Organic Four&#8208;Electron Redox Systems Based on Bipyridine and Phenanthroline Carbene Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel four&#8208;electron redox&#8208;systems featuring up to five isolable oxidation states are presented. The synthesis is modular and based on the combination of diquat or phenanthrolinium salts with stable carbenes. The different oxidation states can be isolated and feature diradical and mixed valence states. Charge/discharge experiments confirm that these redox systems are promising new lead structures for two&#8208;electron anolyte materials.







Abstract
Novel organic redox systems that display multistage redox behaviour are highly sought&#8208;after for a series of applications such as organic batteries or electrochromic materials. Here we describe a simple strategy to transfer well&#8208;known two&#8208;electron redox active bipyridine and phenanthroline architectures into novel strongly reducing four&#8208;electron redox systems featuring fully reversible redox events with up to five stable oxidation states. We give spectroscopic and structural insight into the changes involved in the redox&#8208;events and present characterization data on all isolated oxidation states. The redox&#8208;systems feature strong UV/Vis/NIR polyelectrochromic properties such as distinct strong NIR absorptions in the mixed valence states. Two&#8208;electron charge&#8211;discharge cycling studies indicate high electrochemical stability at strongly negative potentials, rendering the new redox architectures promising lead structures for multi&#8208;electron anolyte materials.

A suite of pyridoxal probes that infiltrate the cellular metabolism of critical pathogens and get incorporated in pyridoxal&#8208;phosphate dependent enzymes is applied. Chemoproteomics facilitated the functional characterization of previously unknown members and the identification of essential targets with antibiotic hit molecules.







Abstract
Unprecedented bacterial targets are urgently needed to overcome the resistance crisis. Herein we systematically mine pyridoxal phosphate&#8208;dependent enzymes (PLP&#8208;DEs) in bacteria to focus on a target class which is involved in crucial metabolic processes. For this, we tailored eight pyridoxal (PL) probes bearing modifications at various positions. Overall, the probes exceeded the performance of a previous generation and provided a detailed map of PLP&#8208;DEs in clinically relevant pathogens including challenging Gram&#8208;negative strains. Putative PLP&#8208;DEs with unknown function were exemplarily characterized via in&#8208;depth enzymatic assays. Finally, we screened a panel of PLP binders for antibiotic activity and unravelled the targets of hit molecules. Here, an uncharacterized enzyme, essential for bacterial growth, was assigned as PLP&#8208;dependent cysteine desulfurase and confirmed to be inhibited by the marketed drug phenelzine. Our approach provides a basis for deciphering novel PLP&#8208;DEs as essential antibiotic targets along with corresponding ways to decipher small molecule inhibitors.

         <title>Pyrene&#8208;Based Dopant&#8208;Free Hole&#8208;Transport Polymers with Fluorine&#8208;Induced Favorable Molecular Stacking Enable Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
A new class of polymeric hole&#8208;transport materials (HTMs) was explored, featuring fluorine&#8208;substituted pyrene and specific Pb&#8722;Se secondary interactions. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) using PE10 as dopant&#8208;free HTM, afforded an excellent PCE of 22.3&#8201;%, positioning it among the best PSCs based on dopant&#8208;free HTMs.







Abstract
A new class of polymeric hole&#8208;transport materials (HTMs) are explored by inserting a two&#8208;dimensionally conjugated fluoro&#8208;substituted pyrene into thiophene and selenophene polymeric chains. The broad conjugated plane of pyrene and &#8220;Lewis soft&#8221; selenium atoms not only enhance the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of HTM molecules greatly but also render a strong interaction with the perovskite surface, leading to an efficient charge transport/transfer in both the HTM layer and the perovskite/HTM interface. Note that fluorine substitution adjacent to pyrene boosts the stacking of HTMs towards a more favorable face&#8208;on orientation, further facilitating the efficient charge transport. As a result, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) employing PE10 as dopant&#8208;free HTM afford an excellent efficiency of 22.3&#8201;% and the dramatically enhanced device longevity, qualifying it among the best PSCs based on dopant&#8208;free HTMs.

         <title>Catalytic Degradation of Polyethylene Terephthalate Using a Phase&#8208;Transitional Zirconium&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Zr&#8208;MOF) UiO&#8208;66 catalyzes the degradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into monomers. During the degradation process, UiO&#8208;66 transforms into another Zr&#8208;MOF MIL&#8208;140 which also shows good catalytic reactivity for the degradation of PET.







Abstract
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is utilized as one of the most popular consumer plastics worldwide, but difficulties associated with recycling PET have generated a severe environmental crisis with most PET ending its lifecycle in landfills. We report that zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Zr&#8208;MOF) UiO&#8208;66 deconstructs waste PET into the building blocks terephthalic acid (TA) and mono&#8208;methyl terephthalate (MMT) within 24&#8197;hours at 260&#8201;&#176;C (total yield of 98&#8201;% under 1&#8197;atm H2 and 81&#8201;% under 1&#8197;atm Ar). Extensive structural characterization studies reveal that during the degradation process, UiO&#8208;66 undergoes an intriguing transformation into MIL&#8208;140A, which is another Zr&#8208;MOF that shows good catalytic activity toward PET degradation under similar reaction conditions. These results illustrate the diversity of applications for Zr&#8208;MOFs and establish MOFs as a new class of polymer degradation catalysts with the potential to address long&#8208;standing challenges associated with plastic waste.

         <title>A Strategy Based on Aggregation&#8208;Induced Ratiometric Emission to Differentiate Molecular Weight of Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through introducing fluorophores based on aggregation&#8208;induced ratiometric emission into supramolecular monomers, the molecular weight and fluorescence color of supramolecular polymers can be linked. In this system, with the increasing molecular weight, the fluorescence color changed from dark blue to yellow&#8208;green concurrently, thus enabling the visual differentiation of the molecular weight of supramolecular polymers.







Abstract
Molecular weight has an important bearing on the properties of supramolecular polymers. However, the intuitive differentiation of the molecular weight of supramolecular polymers remains challenging. Given this situation, establishing a reliable relationship between fluorescence properties and molecular weight may be a promising strategy. Herein, we prepared a supramolecular monomer M1 with aggregation&#8208;induced ratiometric emission characteristics. With the increasing M1 concentration (0.100&#8211;100&#8197;mM), the average degree of polymerization (DPDOSY) rose from 1.00 to 293. Meanwhile, the color changed from dark blue to cyan, finally to yellow&#8208;green in the same concentration range. Hence, the intuitive relationship between DPDOSY and fluorescence colors was constructed, allowing the visual differentiation of molecular weight. Moreover, the fluorescence color could be regulated by introducing a competitive molecule to induce the depolymerization of supramolecular polymers.

         <title>Inside Cover: Photocatalytic Abstraction of Hydrogen Atoms from Water Using Hydroxylated Graphitic Carbon Nitride for Hydrogenative Coupling Reactions (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 24/2022)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using water as a hydrogen source to perform chemical reactions is fascinating but challenging because of the high H&#8722;O bond dissociation energy of water (ca. 5&#8197;eV). Tingbin Lim, Ren Su, and co&#8208;workers show in their Research Article (e202204256) that surface&#8208;hydroxylated graphitic carbon nitride only requires 2.25&#8197;eV to activate water for reactions involving a hydrogen atom transfer step, allowing solar&#8208;driven eco&#8208;friendly synthetic chemistry.

Tingbin Lim, Ren Su, and co-workers show in their Research Article (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202204256"&gt;e202204256&lt;/a&gt;) that surface-hydroxylated graphitic carbon nitride only requires 2.25&#8197;eV to activate water for reactions involving a hydrogen atom transfer step, allowing solar-driven eco-friendly synthetic chemistry.

         <dc:description>
Enhancement of the enzymatic activity of cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated metal&#8211;organic framework nanoparticles by depleting membrane cholesterol is demonstrated by Weiwei&#8197;Gao, Liangfang Zhang et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202203115). Increased membrane permeability, caused by the reduction in cholesterol level, is likely responsible for the increased enzymatic activity. This discovery broadens the use of these biomimetic nanoparticles in drug delivery and biodetoxification.

         <dc:description>
The global atlas of bacterial aromatic polyketides is reported by Lihan Zhang and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202202286). By pan&#8208;genomic analysis of the biosynthetic gene clusters of type&#8197;II polyketide synthases, the global distribution, abundance, and structural diversity of the aromatic polyketides were assessed. The study also provides insight for the molecular evolution of aromatic polyketides and serves as a compass for future discoveries of this class of natural products.

Are photoproteins stable enough for operation in real world technologies? The Research Article (e202201148) by Vincent&#8197;M. Friebe, Raoul&#8197;N. Frese, and co&#8208;workers pushes the operation of a biohybrid photoelectrode to new lengths. By stabilizing the pathways crucial for electron transfer, it was possible to prolong electrode operation to the equivalent of a full year of solar insolation in the Netherlands, as well as to maintain output after storage for 2.5&#8197;years. These findings will be instrumental for realizing photoprotein&#8208;based technologies such as biosensors or biophotovoltaics.

         <title>Signal Transduction Strategies for Analyte Detection Using DNA&#8208;Based Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The various signal transduction strategies that are employed in chemical and biological sensing with DNA&#8208;based nanostructures are the focus of this Minireview. The relative advantages and disadvantages of these different methods are also discussed and the considerations that determine the ideal strategy for a given application are delineated.







Abstract
The use of DNA&#8208;based nanostructures as probes has led to significant advances in chemical and biological sensing, allowing the detection of analytes in complex media, the understanding of fundamental biological processes, and the ability to diagnose diseases based on molecular signatures. The utility of these structures arises both from DNA's inherent ability to selectively recognize and bind a variety of chemical species and from the unique properties observed when DNA is restructured at the nanoscale. In this Minireview, we chronicle the most commonly used signal transduction strategies that have been interfaced with various DNA&#8208;based nanostructures. We discuss the types of analytes and the detection scenarios that are sought after, delineate the advantages and disadvantages of each signaling strategy, and outline the key considerations that guide the selection of each signaling method.

We discuss the types of analytes and the detection scenarios that are sought after, delineate the advantages and disadvantages of each signaling strategy, and outline the key considerations that guide the selection of each signaling method.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal Halide Perovskite Based Heterojunction Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in constructing photocatalysts based on metal halide perovskite (MHP) heterojunctions, including Schottky, type&#8197;II, and Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, which show improved carrier separation and accelerated surface reaction rates for efficient solar energy conversion are discussed systematically in this Review. Techniques for identifying the type of active heterojunctions are also evaluated and challenges and future directions highlighted.







Abstract
With fascinating photophysical properties and a strong potential to utilize solar energy, metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have become a prominent feature within photocatalysis research. However, the effectiveness of single MHP photocatalysts is relatively poor. The introduction of a second component to form a heterojunction represents a well&#8208;established route to accelerate carrier migration and boost reaction rates, thus increasing the photoactivity. Recently, there have been several scientific advances related to the design of MHP&#8208;based heterojunction photocatalysts, including Schottky, type&#8197;II, and Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions. In this Review, we systematically discuss and critically appraise recent developments in MHP&#8208;based heterojunction photocatalysis. In addition, the techniques for identifying the type of active heterojunctions are evaluated and we conclude by briefly outlining the ongoing challenges and future directions for promising photocatalysts based on MHP heterojunctions.

         <title>Reversing a Platinum Micromotor by Introducing Platinum Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Platinum oxides (primarily PtO) are produced during the sputter&#8208;coating of Pt films by O2 plasma, and PtO reverses the swimming direction of a micromotor by self&#8208;electrophoresis.







Abstract
Understanding and controlling the swimming direction of a synthetic nano&#8208; and micromotor holds fundamental and applied significance. Here, we focus on platinum&#8208;containing Janus colloids that catalytically decompose H2O2 into O2, an archetypical model of chemical micromotor. We discover that platinum oxides (primarily PtO) are produced on Pt films sputter&#8208;coated in O2 plasma, and PtO reverses the motor possibly by self&#8208;electrophoresis. Using this knowledge, micromotors moving in either direction were fabricated by intentionally introducing or removing PtO. These findings challenge the conventional wisdom that a Pt micromotor is powered by Pt alone, and open up new avenues for controlling the swimming directions of a micro&#8208; and nanomachine.

         <title>Functionalized Acyclic (l)&#8208;Threoninol Nucleic Acid Four&#8208;Way Junction with High Stability In Vitro and In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oligonucleotide analogue (l)&#8208;aTNA forms a highly stable four&#8208;way junction, which is used to assemble multiple components conjugated to the short (l)&#8208;aTNA strands. This represents a modular approach to assemble multifunctional drug structures. The cellular targeting of a structure containing a HER2 nanobody is shown in vitro and the circulation of a fatty acid functionalized structure is shown in vivo.







Abstract
Oligonucleotides are increasingly being used as a programmable connection material to assemble molecules and proteins in well&#8208;defined structures. For the application of such assemblies for in vivo diagnostics or therapeutics it is crucial that the oligonucleotides form highly stable, non&#8208;toxic, and non&#8208;immunogenic structures. Only few oligonucleotide derivatives fulfil all of these requirements. Here we report on the application of acyclic l&#8208;threoninol nucleic acid (aTNA) to form a four&#8208;way junction (4WJ) that is highly stable and enables facile assembly of components for in vivo treatment and imaging. The aTNA 4WJ is serum&#8208;stable, shows no non&#8208;targeted uptake or cytotoxicity, and invokes no innate immune response. As a proof of concept, we modify the 4WJ with a cancer&#8208;targeting and a serum half&#8208;life extension moiety and show the effect of these functionalized 4WJs in vitro and in vivo, respectively.

         <title>Synergistic Generation and Accumulation of Triplet Excitons for Efficient Ultralong Organic Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the synergistic effect of generation and accumulation of triplet excitons, an efficient UOP molecule (2Br&#8208;OSPh), which exhibits a fast rate of intersystem crossing and a small energy gap between monomeric phosphorescence and aggregated state phosphorescence has been synthesized with the longest lifetime and brightest UOP among its isomers.







Abstract
The traditional method to achieve ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) is to hybrid n&#960;* and &#960;&#960;* configurations in appropriate proportion, which are contradictory to each other for improving efficiency and lifetime of phosphorescence. In this work, through replacing the electron&#8208;donating aromatic group with a methoxy group and combining intramolecular halogen bond to promote intersystem crossing and suppress non&#8208;radiative transition, an efficient UOP molecule (2Br&#8208;OSPh) has been synthesized with the longest lifetime and brightest UOP among its isomers. As compared to CzS2Br, which has a similar substituted position of bromine atom and a larger kisc (the rate of intersystem crossing), the smaller &#916;ETT* (the energy gap between monomeric phosphorescence and aggregated state phosphorescence) in 2Br&#8208;OSPh could accelerate the transition from T1 to T1*. This research indicates that both generation and accumulation of triplet excitons play an important role in realizing efficient UOP materials.

         <title>Phosphine&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective (3+2) Annulation of Vinylcyclopropanes with Imines for the Synthesis of Chiral Pyrrolidines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclopropanes are important synthetic building blocks in organic chemistry. In this study, the first phosphine&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective (3+2) annulation between vinylcyclopropanes and N&#8208;tosylaldimines was achieved, which led to the formation of a range of highly functionalized pyrrolidines in high yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities.







Abstract
A phosphine&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective and diastereoselective (up to 98&#8201;% ee and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr) (3+2) annulation between vinylcyclopropanes and N&#8208;tosylaldimines has been developed, which allows facile access to a range of highly functionalized chiral pyrrolidines. Notably, this method makes use of vinylcyclopropanes as a synthon for phosphine&#8208;mediated asymmetric annulation reaction, which will offer new opportunities for potential applications of cyclopropanes substrates in phosphine&#8208;catalyzed organic transformations.

         <title>An Anionic Dinuclear Ruthenium Dihydrogen Complex of Relevance for Alkyne gem&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic and neutral non&#8208;classical &#963;&#8208;H2 complexes are plentiful, but anionic ones remain exceedingly rare. It was during an investigation into the fate of a Ru&#8208;precatalyst in the light&#8208;driven alkyne gem&#8208;hydrogenation that such a species was encountered, which seems to be &#8220;first&#8208;in&#8208;class&#8221;: it lacks any substructures that counteract the negative charge and prevent oxidative insertion of the metal centers into the ligated H&#8722;H bond from occurring.







Abstract
During an investigation into the fate of ruthenium precatalysts used for light&#8208;driven alkyne gem&#8208;hydrogenation reactions with formation of Grubbs&#8208;type ruthenium catalysts, it was found that the reaction of [(IPr)(&#951;6&#8208;cymene)RuCl2] with H2 under UV&#8208;irradiation affords an anionic dinuclear &#963;&#8208;dihydrogen complex, which is thermally surprisingly robust. Not only are anionic &#963;&#8208;complexes in general exceedingly rare, but the newly formed species seems to be the first example lacking any structural attributes able to counterbalance the negative charge and, in so doing, prevent oxidative insertion of the metal centers into the ligated H2 from occurring.

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Endocyclic Allenes by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Annulation Followed by Cope Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A relay strategy merging Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cycloaddition and enyne&#8208;Cope rearrangement is disclosed, affording chiral 9&#8208;membered endocyclic allenes with high efficiency and enantioselectivity. Experimental and DFT calculation results rationalized the Cope rearrangement that allowed for the complete central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer.







Abstract
Catalytic asymmetric synthesis of chiral endocyclic allenes remains a challenge in allene chemistry owing to unfavored tension and complex chirality. Here, we present a new relay strategy merging Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] annulation with enyne&#8208;Cope rearrangement, providing a facile route to chiral 9&#8208;membered endocyclic allenes with high efficiency and enantioselectivity. Moreover, theoretical calculations and experimental studies were performed to illustrate the critical, but unusual Cope rearrangement that allows for the complete central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer.

         <title>Electrophilic Spirocyclization of a 2&#8208;Biphenylacetylene via Conformational Fixing within a Hollow&#8208;Cage Host</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regioselective spirocyclization of a 2&#8208;biphenyl acetylene was achieved by virtue of a spatial constraint in a self&#8208;assembled molecular cage. The unusual, folded conformation in the cavity alters the selectivity of the electrophilic cyclization from 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig to 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig to form a hindered spiro compound. NBS= N&#8208;bromosuccinimide; NIS= N&#8208;iodosuccinimide.







Abstract
A 2&#8208;biphenylacetylene was fixed into a specific conformation within the confined cavity of a hollow cage, where it underwent a regioselective spirocyclization in the presence of an electrophile. A 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization proceeded selectively in the cage, which stands in sharp contrast to the 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization that normally occurs in common organic media. The folded conformation adopted by the substrate within the cage was examined by 1H NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis.

         <title>Decarbonylative Transfer Hydrochlorination of Alkenes and Alkynes Based on a B(C6F5)3&#8208;Initiated Grob Fragmentation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>

B(C6F5)3 initiates the Grob fragmentation of cyclohexa&#8208;2,5&#8208;dien&#8208;1&#8208;yl&#8208;substituted acyl chlorides into a low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight arene, carbon monoxide and HCl. In the presence of &#960;&#8208;basic substrates such as alkenes and alkynes, HCl is transferred stepwise to afford the corresponding hydrochlorination products. The overall reaction is a decarbonylative transfer hydrochlorination driven by aromatization and carbon&#8208;monoxide release.







Abstract
Readily available cyclohexa&#8208;2,5&#8208;dien&#8208;1&#8208;ylcarbonyl chloride derivatives are introduced as bench&#8208;stable HCl surrogates for transfer hydrochlorination of terminal and internal alkenes as well as selected alkynes. The stepwise Grob fragmentation of those acyl chlorides into chloride, carbon monoxide, a low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight arene, and a proton is promoted by B(C6F5)3. This decarbonylative transfer process enables the addition of HCl across C&#8722;C double and triple bonds with Markovnikov selectivity at room temperature.

         <title>An Integrated Carbon Nitride&#8208;Nickel Photocatalyst for the Amination of Aryl Halides Using Sodium Azide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterogeneous photocatalytic method is reported for the selective synthesis of primary anilines via cross&#8208;coupling of a wide range of aryl/heteroaryl halides with sodium azide using nickel deposited on a mesoporous carbon nitride material. This procedure removes the need for sophisticated ligands, precious metals, and elevated temperatures/pressures, and it takes place under mild reaction conditions with a recyclable catalyst.







Abstract
The synthesis of primary anilines via sustainable methods remains a challenge in organic synthesis. We report a photocatalytic protocol for the selective synthesis of primary anilines via cross&#8208;coupling of a wide range of aryl/heteroaryl halides with sodium azide using a photocatalyst powder consisting of nickel(II) deposited on mesoporous carbon nitride (Ni&#8208;mpg&#8208;CNx). This heterogeneous photocatalyst contains a high surface area with a visible light&#8208;absorbing and adaptive &#8220;built&#8208;in&#8221; solid&#8208;state ligand for the integrated catalytic Ni site. The method displays a high functional group tolerance, requires mild reaction conditions, and benefits from easy recovery and reuse of the photocatalyst powder. Thereby, it overcomes the need of complex ligand scaffolds required in homogeneous catalysis, precious metals and elevated temperatures/pressures in existing protocols of primary anilines synthesis. The reported heterogeneous Ni&#8208;mpg&#8208;CNx holds potential for applications in the academic and industrial synthesis of anilines and exploration of other photocatalytic transformations.

A catalytic asymmetric P&#8208;arylation of H&#8208;phosphinate was developed via an interesting dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation. The copper&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic C&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling/cyclization provides a general method for the highly enantioselective synthesis of P&#8208;stereogenic P&#8208;heterocycles. The copper complex was responsible for the racemization of the H&#8208;phosphinates. H&#8208;Phenylphosphinates, H&#8208;alkenylphosphinate and H&#8208;alkylphosphinates were examined and delivered the products in high yields and high ee values.







Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric aryl C&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling/cyclization reaction was successfully developed via dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DYKAT) under mild conditions. This study provides a general and simple method for the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of stable six&#8208;, seven&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered P&#8208;stereogenic phosphorus heterocycles with excellent enantioselectivities and moderate to high yields. One&#8208;pot gram&#8208;scale asymmetric synthesis of the P&#8208;stereogenic P&#8208;heterocycle from commercially available materials was also successfully accomplished with excellent enantioselectivity and high yield.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Regioselective Construction of 1,4&#8208;Diamines via Cascade Hydroamination of Methylene Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydroamination of methylene cyclopropanes allowed the synthesis of a wide range of chiral 1,4&#8208;diamine derivatives in high yields and enantioselectivities (up to 95&#8201;% yield and up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee). The structure complexity of 1,4&#8208;diamines was further increased by using two different functionalized amino agents. Mechanistic studies show a potential pathway involving the hydroamination ring&#8208;opening with &#946;&#8208;C elimination followed by a cascade hydroamination sequence.







Abstract
Despite the widespread existence of chiral 1,4&#8208;diamines in bioactive molecules and their applications in asymmetric catalysis, the catalytic and asymmetric synthesis of such structures from readily accessible substrates remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here, we report a Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cascade hydroamination protocol to construct a wide range of chiral 1,4&#8208;diamine derivatives in high yields with excellent enatioselectivities (up to 95&#8201;% yield and up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee). The use of two hydroxylamine esters containing different functionalized amino groups allowed us to increase the complexity of the final 1,4&#8208;diamine structures. The desired products could be easily transformed into chiral 1,4&#8208;diamines and chiral NH2&#8208;Terfenadine. Mechanistic study demonstrates that this reaction proceeds through hydroamination ring&#8208;opening and cascade hydroamination sequence.

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution NMR H/D Exchange of Human Superoxide Dismutase Inclusion Bodies Reveals Significant Native Features Despite Structural Heterogeneity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Measurements of quenched hydrogen&#8211;deuterium exchange by NMR, FTIR, and Congo red binding provide a rare, high&#8208;resolution view of the inclusion body (IB) structure at the atomic level. Diverse mutations in superoxide dismutase (SOD1) adopt remarkably similar IB structures comprising an ensemble with some amyloid&#8208;like structure together with extensive native&#8208;like conformations.







Abstract
Protein aggregation is central to aging, disease and biotechnology. While there has been recent progress in defining structural features of cellular protein aggregates, many aspects remain unclear due to heterogeneity of aggregates presenting obstacles to characterization. Here we report high&#8208;resolution analysis of cellular inclusion bodies (IBs) of immature human superoxide dismutase (SOD1) mutants using NMR quenched amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange (qHDX), FTIR and Congo red binding. The extent of aggregation is correlated with mutant global stability and, notably, the free energy of native dimer dissociation, indicating contributions of native&#8208;like monomer associations to IB formation. This is further manifested by a common pattern of extensive protection against H/D exchange throughout nine mutant SOD1s despite their diverse characteristics. These results reveal multiple aggregation&#8208;prone regions in SOD1 and illuminate how aggregation may occur via an ensemble of pathways.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Stereoselective C(sp3)&#8722;H Glycosylation for the Synthesis of C&#8208;Glycoamino Acids and C&#8208;Glycopeptides</title>

         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted and copper&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective C(sp3)&#8722;H glycosylation reaction was developed for the synthesis of a wide variety of C&#8208;glycoamino acids and C&#8208;glycopeptidomimetics with good yields and excellent stereoselectivity. The mild reaction conditions are compatible with various carbohydrate substrates, as demonstrated with a series of monosaccharides and a disaccharide.







Abstract
The glycosylative modification of peptides could improve the pharmacological properties of peptide drugs and deliver them efficiently to the target sites. Compared with O&#8208;/N&#8208;glycosides, C&#8208;glycosides exhibit more metabolic stability. We here disclose the first example of visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted and Cu&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective C&#8208;glycosylation. The mild reaction conditions are compatible with various carbohydrate substrates, as demonstrated with a series of monosaccharides and a disaccharide, and are amenable to the synthesis of a wide variety of C&#8208;glycoamino acids and C&#8208;glycopeptidomimetics with good yields and excellent stereoselectivities. The dual&#8208;functional photocatalyst formed in situ via coordination of the glycine derivative and the chiral phosphine Cu complex could not only catalyze the photoredox process but also control the stereoselectivity of the glycosylation reaction.

         <title>BN&#8208;Anthracene for High&#8208;Mobility Organic Optoelectronic Materials through Periphery Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;mobility organic semiconductors based on classical BN&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (BN&#8208;PAHs) have been achieved through a &#8220;periphery engineering&#8221; strategy. Remarkably, diphenyl&#8208;substituted BN&#8208;anthracene (DPBNA), with a highest hole mobility of 1.3&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in organic field&#8208;effect transistors and excellent performance in phototransistors, is the first BN&#8208;PAH that outperforms amorphous silicon.







Abstract
Despite the remarkable synthetic accomplishments in creating diverse polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with B&#8722;N bonds (BN&#8208;PAHs), their optoelectronic applications have been less exploited. Herein, we report the achievement of high&#8208;mobility organic semiconductors based on existing BN&#8208;PAHs through a &#8220;periphery engineering&#8221; strategy.

&lt;p&gt;High-mobility organic semiconductors based on classical BN-embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (BN-PAHs) have been achieved through a &#8220;periphery engineering&#8221; strategy. Remarkably, diphenyl-substituted BN-anthracene (DPBNA), with a highest hole mobility of 1.3&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in organic field-effect transistors and excellent performance in phototransistors, is the first BN-PAH that outperforms amorphous silicon.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the remarkable synthetic accomplishments in creating diverse polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with B&#8722;N bonds (BN-PAHs), their optoelectronic applications have been less exploited. Herein, we report the achievement of high-mobility organic semiconductors based on existing BN-PAHs through a &#8220;periphery engineering&#8221; strategy. Tetraphenyl- and diphenyl-substituted BN-anthracenes (TPBNA and DPBNA, respectively) are designed and synthesized. DPBNA exhibits the highest hole mobility of 1.3&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in organic field-effect transistors, significantly outperforming TPBNA and all the reported BN-PAHs. Remarkably, this is the first BN-PAH with mobility over 1&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is a benchmark value for practical applications as compared with amorphous silicon.

         <title>LiBF4&#8208;Induced Rearrangement and Desymmetrization of a Palladium&#8208;Ligand Assembly</title>

Template&#8208;induced complexity: LiBF4 induces the rearrangement of a homoleptic Pd2L4 complex into a Pd4L8 assembly. The complex shows a folded, highly compact structure, with a low apparent symmetry and two highly specific binding pockets.







Abstract
Thirteen palladium&#8208;ligand assemblies with different structures and topologies were investigated for the ability to bind lithium ions. In one case, the addition of LiBF4 resulted in a profound structural rearrangement, converting a dincluclear [Pd2L4]4+ complex into a low&#8208;symmetry [Pd4L8]8+ assembly with two binding pockets for solvated LiBF4 ion pairs. The rearrangement could only be induced by Li+, indicating highly specific host&#8211;guest interactions. A structural analysis of the [Pd4L8]8+ receptor revealed a compact structure with multiple intramolecular interactions, reminiscent of what is seen for natural and synthetic foldamers.

         <title>Identifying Crystallographically Different Si&#8722;OH&#8722;Al Br&#248;nsted Acid Sites in LTA Zeolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The existence of crystallographically different Si&#8722;OH&#8722;Al Br&#248;nsted acid sites in LTA zeolites has been identified using IR and 2D MAS NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. This has been successfully rationalized in terms of the secondary building unit concept.







Abstract
A clear understanding of the acidic properties of bridging Si&#8722;OH&#8722;Al groups containing crystallographically different oxygen atoms in zeolites is a prerequisite for optimizing their performance as industrial solid catalysts and developing new acid&#8208;catalyzed reactions, but presents many challenges. Here, we report the direct observation of yet unrecognized bridging Si&#8722;OH&#8722;Al groups in the LTA zeolite whose oxygen atoms are crystallographically different from those of already known Br&#248;nsted acid sites. We also report that the creation of a crystallographically particular type of bridging OH groups in zeolites and its concentration and acid strength can vary strongly with the content and spatial distribution of framework Al atoms, thus being synthetic in nature, which has been rationalized in terms of the secondary building unit concept.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Corrole&#8208;Based Porous Organic Polymers for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction and Evolution Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;corrole&#8208;based porous organic polymers are synthesized and are more active and durable than metal corrole monomers for electrocatalytic O2 reduction and evolution reactions. By tuning the metal active site, the Co&#8208;based framework showed the highest activity among examined catalysts. With the benefits of using highly active metal corrole cores, this work presents unparalleled examples of metal&#8208;corrole&#8208;based frameworks for oxygen electrocatalysis.







Abstract
Integrating molecular catalysts into designed frameworks often enables improved catalysis. Compared with porphyrin&#8208;based frameworks, metal&#8208;corrole&#8208;based frameworks have been rarely developed, although monomeric metal corroles are usually more efficient than porphyrin counterparts for the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We herein report on metal&#8208;corrole&#8208;based porous organic polymers (POPs) as ORR and OER electrocatalysts. M&#8208;POPs (M=Mn, Fe, Co, Cu) were synthesized by coupling metal 10&#8208;phenyl&#8208;5,15&#8208;(4&#8208;iodophenyl)corrole with tetrakis(4&#8208;ethynylphenyl)methane. Compared with metal corrole monomers, M&#8208;POPs displayed significantly enhanced catalytic activity and stability. Co&#8208;POP outperformed other M&#8208;POPs by achieving four&#8208;electron ORR with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.87&#8197;V vs. RHE and reaching 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 OER current density at 340&#8197;mV overpotential. This work is unparalleled to develop and explore metal&#8208;corrole&#8208;based POPs as electrocatalysts.

         <title>Membrane Cholesterol Depletion Enhances Enzymatic Activity of Cell&#8208;Membrane&#8208;Coated Metal&#8208;Organic&#8208;Framework Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework nanoparticles (NPs) are used for enzyme delivery because of their unique biointerface and loading capabilities. It is demonstrated that the enzymatic activity of the NPs is negatively correlated to the level of cholesterol within the cell membranes, providing a facile and practical approach for the design of enzyme&#8208;loaded nanotherapeutics.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework nanoparticles (MOF NPs) have been increasingly used to encapsulate therapeutic enzymes for delivery. To better interface these MOF NPs with biological systems, researchers have coated them with natural cell membranes, enabling biomimicking properties suitable for innovative biomedical applications. Herein, we report that the enzymatic activity of cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated MOF NPs can be significantly enhanced by reducing membrane cholesterol content. We demonstrate such cholesterol&#8208;enzymatic activity correlation using zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 MOF NPs to encapsulate catalase, horseradish peroxidase, and organophosphate hydrolase, respectively. MOF NPs coated with membranes of human red blood cells or macrophages show similar outcomes, illustrating the broad applicability of this finding. The mechanistic investigation further reveals that reducing cholesterol levels effectively enhances membrane permeability likely responsible for the increased enzymatic activity. These results also imply a facile approach to tailoring the enzymatic activity of cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated MOF NPs by simply tuning the membrane cholesterol level.

         <title>Counterion&#8208;Paired Bright Heptamethine Fluorophores with NIR&#8208;II Excitation and Emission Enable Multiplexed Biomedical Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of heptamethine cyanines (HCs) has absorption/emission maxima spanning from 1100 to 1600&#8197;nm. A counterion&#8208;paired strategy was explored to improve the brightness of HCs in aqueous solution by reducing aggregation and polarization. Profiting from enhanced brightness and well&#8208;shaped absorption spectra, dual&#8208;color imaging based on NIR&#8208;II excitation and emission was performed in living mice for the first time.







Abstract
Photon excitation and emission at the NIR&#8208;II spectral window enable high&#8208;contrast deep&#8208;tissue bioimaging. However, multiplexed imaging with NIR&#8208;II excitation and emission has been hampered by the limited chemical strategies to develop bright fluorophores with tunable absorption in this spectral regime. Herein, we developed a series of heptamethine cyanines (HCs) with varied absorption/emission maxima spanning from 1100 to 1600&#8197;nm through a physical organic approach. A bulky counterion paired to HCs was found to elicit substantial improvements in absorptivity (7&#8208;fold), brightness (14&#8208;fold), and spectral profiles in water, addressing a notorious quenching problem of NIR&#8208;II cyanines due to aggregation and polarization. We demonstrated the utilities of HC1222 and HC1342 for high&#8208;contrast dual&#8208;color imaging of circulatory system, lymphatic structures, tumor, and organ function in living mice under 1120&#8197;nm and 1319&#8197;nm excitation, showing HCs as a promising platform for non&#8208;invasive bioimaging.

         <dc:description>
The synthesis of cyclic allylborates was achieved by the reaction of 1,3&#8208;dienes and B2pin2 using a copper catalyst. The cyclic allylborate could be used in several organic transformations such as regioselective protonation, the allylation of electrophiles, and Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling.







Abstract
The synthesis of cyclic allylborates was achieved by the reaction of 1,3&#8208;dienes and B2pin2 using a copper catalyst. Several 1,3&#8208;dienes were converted to the corresponding cyclic allylborates in moderate to high yields. The cyclic allylborate obtained could be used in several organic transformations such as allylation of electrophiles and Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling.

         <title>Dual In Situ Laser Techniques Underpin the Role of Cations in Impacting Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ Raman spectroscopy and the laser&#8208;induced current transient (LICT) technique elucidated the fact that the nature of alkali metal cations can significantly influence the oxygen evolution activity of surface&#8208;mounted metal&#8211;organic framework derived NiFe(OOH) electrocatalyst, following the order of Cs+&gt;K+&gt;Na+&gt;Li+.







Abstract
Understanding the electrode/electrolyte interface is crucial for optimizing electrocatalytic performances. Here, we demonstrate that the nature of alkali metal cations can profoundly impact the oxygen evolution activity of surface&#8208;mounted metal&#8211;organic framework (SURMOF) derived electrocatalysts, which are based on NiFe(OOH). In situ Raman spectroscopy results show that Raman shifts of the Ni&#8722;O bending vibration are inversely proportional to the mass activities from Cs+ to Li+. Particularly, a laser&#8208;induced current transient technique was introduced to study the cation&#8208;dependent electric double layer properties and their effects on the activity. The catalytic trend appeared to be closely related to the potential of maximum entropy of the system, suggesting a strong cation impact on the interfacial water layer structure. Our results highlight how the electrolyte composition can be used to maximize the performance of SURMOF derivatives toward electrochemical water splitting.

         <title>Synthesis of Atropisomeric Two&#8208;Axis Systems by the Catalyst&#8208;Controlled syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;Selective Arene&#8208;Forming Aldol Condensation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complete stereochemical addressability for all atropisomeric enantio&#8208; and diastereomers is viable by converting diketo substrates with simultaneous control over two configurationally stable stereogenic axes. The atropisomeric two&#8208;axis systems were prepared by the direct catalyst&#8208;controlled arene&#8208;forming aldol condensation using cinchona alkaloid&#8208;based ion&#8208;pairing catalyst with up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 e.r.







Abstract
Simultaneous control over the configuration of multiple stereocenters is accomplished by numerous catalytic methods, providing a reliable basis for the synthesis of stereochemically complex targets in isomerically defined form. In contrast, addressing the configurations of multiple stereogenic axes with diastereodivergent catalyst control is thus far only possible by stepwise approaches. Herein we now describe that all four stereoisomers of atropisomeric two&#8208;axis systems are directly tractable by assembling a central aromatic unit of teraryls through an arene&#8208;forming aldol condensation. By using cinchona alkaloid&#8208;based ion&#8208;pairing catalysts, the four feasible reaction pathways are differentiated from identical substrates under defined basic conditions without preactivation, thus enabling complete stereodivergence with enantioselectivities of up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 e.r.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Starfish Cyclic Steroid Glycosides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enabled by de novo construction of the ether&#8208;linked hexopyranosyl units, the use of olefinic pyranoses as sugar precursors, and a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closing glycosylation, the major starfish cyclic steroid glycosides, namely luzonicoside&#8197;A and D and sepositoside&#8197;A, have been synthesized for the first time.







Abstract
Starfishes have evolved with a special type of secondary metabolites, namely starfish saponins, to ward off various predators and parasites; among them, the starfish cyclic steroid glycosides stand out structurally, featuring a unique 16&#8208;membered ring formed by bridging the steroidal C3 and C6 with a trisaccharide. The rigid cyclic scaffold and the congested and vulnerable steroid&#8208;sugar etherate linkage present an unprecedented synthetic challenge. Here we report a collective total synthesis of the major starfish cyclic steroid glycosides, namely luzonicosides&#8197;A (1) and D (2) and sepositoside&#8197;A (3), with an innovative approach, which entails a de novo construction of the ether&#8208;linked hexopyranosyl units, use of olefinic pyranoses as sugar precursors, and a decisive ring&#8208;closing glycosylation under the mild gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed conditions.

         <title>Intermolecular Carbosilylation of &#945;&#8208;Olefins with C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp) Bond Formation Involving Silylium&#8208;Ion Regeneration</title>

Sterically unhindered silylium ions can initiate the silylalkynylation of terminal alkenes with silylated phenylacetylene derivatives in a two&#8208;component reaction. These alkynylsilanes and the silylium&#8208;ion initiator form bis(silylated) ketene&#8208;like carbocations as the actual catalysts (gray box). This new carbosilylation enables the formation of a C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp) bond (see scheme).







Abstract
A regioselective addition of alkynylsilanes across unactivated, terminal alkenes is reported. The reaction is initiated by the capture of a sterically unhindered silylium ion by a silylated phenylacetylene derivative to form a bis(silylated) ketene&#8208;like carbocation. This in situ&#8208;generated key intermediate is the actual catalyst that maintains the catalytic cycle by a series of electrophilic addition reactions of silylium ions and &#946;&#8208;silicon&#8208;stabilized carbocations. The computed reaction mechanism is fully consistent with the experimental findings. This unprecedented two&#8208;component carbosilylation establishes a C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp) bond and a C(sp3)&#8722;Si bond in atom&#8208;economic fashion.

         <title>Aqueous CO2 Reduction on Si Photocathodes Functionalized by Cobalt Molecular Catalysts/Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid photocathode prepared by attaching a molecular cobalt catalyst on a n+&#8208;p Si film coated with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) exhibits 100&#8201;% selectivity and 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency towards CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion in aqueous media under simulated sunlight irradiation. The high performance benefits from CNTs as both a support platform for highly dispersed molecular active sites and an efficient mediator for charge transfer.







Abstract
Photoelectrochemical reduction of CO2 is a promising approach for renewable fuel production. We herein report a novel strategy for preparation of hybrid photocathodes by immobilizing molecular cobalt catalysts on TiO2&#8208;protected n+&#8208;p Si electrodes (Si|TiO2) coated with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. Upon loading a composite of CoII(BrqPy) (BrqPy=4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;bis(4&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8242;&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;quaterpyridine) catalyst and CNT on Si|TiO2, a stable 1&#8208;Sun photocurrent density of &#8722;1.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was sustained over 2&#8197;h in a neutral aqueous solution with unity Faradaic efficiency and selectivity for CO production at a bias of zero overpotential (&#8722;0.11&#8197;V vs. RHE), associated with a turnover frequency (TOFCO) of 2.7&#8197;s&#8722;1. Extending the photoelectrocatalysis to 10&#8197;h, a remarkable turnover number (TONCO) of 57000 was obtained. The high performance shown here is substantially improved from the previously reported photocathodes relying on covalently anchored catalysts.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of a Zeolitic Organic Framework
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first case of zeolite&#8208;like crystalline porous organic materials, ZOF&#8208;1 with high chemical stability, large pore size (up to 16&#8197;&#197;), and excellent specific surface area (&#8776;2785&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1) is reported. It is superior to its analogues with the same network, including traditional aluminosilicate zeolites and zeolitic imidazole frameworks.







Abstract
The development of novel zeolite&#8208;like materials with large channel windows and high stability is of importance but remains a tremendous challenge. Herein, we report the first example of a 3D covalent organic framework with zeolitic network, namely the zeolitic organic framework (ZOF). By combining two kinds of tetrahedral building blocks with fixed or relatively free bond angles, ZOF&#8208;1 with the zeolitic crb net has been successfully synthesized. Its structure was determined by the single&#8208;crystal 3D electron diffraction technique. Remarkably, ZOF&#8208;1 shows high chemical stability, large pore size (up to 16&#8197;&#197;), and excellent specific surface area (&#8776;2785&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), which is superior to its analogues with the same network, including traditional aluminosilicate zeolites and zeolitic imidazole frameworks. This study thus opens a new avenue to construct zeolite&#8208;like materials with pure organic frameworks and will promote their potential applications in adsorption and catalysis for macromolecules.

         <title>Sequencing of Uniform Multifunctional Oligoesters via Random Chain Cleavages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for the determination of the monomer order of sequence&#8208;defined macromolecules by making use of ESI&#8208; or LC&#8211;MS is described. This approach, which relies on the introduction of random chain cleavages within the macromolecular backbone, enabled the rapid chemical sequencing of abiotic macromolecules.







Abstract
Sequence&#8208;defined polymers have been the object of many fascinating studies that focus on their implementation in both material and life science applications. In parallel, iterative synthetic methodologies have become more efficient, whereas the structure elucidation of these molecules is generally dependent on MS/MS analysis. Here, we report an alternative, simple strategy for the determination of the monomer order of uniform oligo(thioether ester)s. This approach, which relies on random cleavages of ester units within the macromolecular backbone via a basic treatment, enables the swift characterization of these macromolecules without the need for MS/MS. Consequently, this method can be used for decoding any information stored within the primary structure of oligoesters by means of ESI&#8208; or LC&#8211;MS. Finally, we speculate that a range of structurally diverse backbones could be susceptible towards this approach, which could promptly expand the library of chemically sequenceable macromolecules.

         <title>Structurally Nontraditional Benzo[c]cinnoline&#8208;Based Electron&#8208;Transporting Materials with 3D Molecular Interaction Architecture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;3D molecular interaction architecture&#8221; strategy has been put forward to design high&#8208;performance electron&#8208;transporting materials (ETMs). As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a type of structurally nontraditional ETMs with the benzo[c]cinnoline (BZC) skeleton exhibit an exceedingly high glass transition temperature, a fast electron mobility and outstanding electroluminescent performances in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs).







Abstract
The academically widely used electron&#8208;transporting materials (ETMs) typically suffer from low glass transition temperatures (Tg) that could lead to poor device stability. Considering practical applications, we herein put forward a &#8220;3D molecular interaction architecture&#8221; strategy to design high&#8208;performance ETMs. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a type of structurally nontraditional ETMs with the benzo[c]cinnoline (BZC) skeleton have been proposed and synthesized by the C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H homo&#8208;coupling of N&#8208;acylaniline as the key step. 2,9&#8208;diphenylbenzo[c]cinnoline (DPBZC) exhibits strong intermolecular interactions that feature a 3D architecture, which boosts Tg to exceedingly high 218&#8201;&#176;C with a fast electron mobility (&#956;e) of 6.4&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. DPBZC&#8208;based fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes show outstanding electroluminescent performances with an external quantum efficiency of 20.1&#8201;% and a power efficiency as high as 70.6&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1, which are superior to those of the devices with the commonly used ETMs.

&lt;p&gt;A &#8220;3D molecular interaction architecture&#8221; strategy has been put forward to design high-performance electron-transporting materials (ETMs). As a proof-of-concept, a type of structurally nontraditional ETMs with the benzo[&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;]cinnoline (&lt;b&gt;BZC&lt;/b&gt;) skeleton exhibit an exceedingly high glass transition temperature, a fast electron mobility and outstanding electroluminescent performances in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs).

         <title>Metal&#8594;Carbon Dative Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ambiphilic system containing a phosphine and a carbenium ion as an L&#8208;type and Z&#8208;type ligand, respectively, readily complexes zero&#8208;valent Group 10 metals to form complexes featuring M&#8594;Ccarbenium dative bonds. The formation of these dative bonds is supported by structural, spectroscopic, and computational studies which show that, out of three metals, palladium is the least metallobasic.







Abstract
As part of our interest in unusual bonding situations, we are now targeting complexes featuring metal&#8594;carbon dative bonds. Here, we report on the formation of such linkages in a series of Group 10 complexes featuring a triarylphosphine ligand functionalized at the &#947; position by a carbenium ion. Through combined synthetic, spectroscopic, and computational studies, we show that the M&#8594;Ccarbenium interaction present in these complexes scales with the basicity of the donor, confirming its dative nature.

         <title>A Noncovalent &#960;&#8208;Stacked Porous Organic Molecular Framework for Selective Separation of Aromatics and Cyclic Aliphatics</title>

A robust &#960;&#8208;stacked porous organic molecular framework selectively separates aromatics over cyclic aliphatics.







Abstract
Selective separation using porous adsorbents is an energy&#8208;efficient alternative to traditional separation techniques. Stacked porous organic molecular frameworks (POMFs) capable of noncovalent &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions are emerging as a new kind of adsorbents that facilitate green separation. Here we report a robust porous molecular crystal (TAPM&#8208;1), which is stabilized by multiple intermolecular &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions. With its long&#8208;range &#960;&#8208;stacking, TAPM&#8208;1 has excellent hydrophobicity, thermostability, recyclability, and high selectivity for aromatics over the corresponding cyclic aliphatics. This enables TAPM&#8208;1 to serve as the stationary phase in the high&#8208;resolution gas chromatographic separation of benzene and cyclohexane or toluene and methylcyclohexane.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization with Hydrazonium Initiators

The metal&#8208;free ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclopropenes with hydrazonium initiators ultilizing the principle of carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis is demonstrated.







Abstract
The ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of cyclopropenes using hydrazonium initiators is described. The initiators, which are formed by the condensation of 2,3&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane and an aldehyde, polymerize cyclopropene monomers by a sequence of [3+2] cycloaddition and cycloreversion reactions. This process generates short chain polyolefins (Mn&#8804;9.4&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1) with relatively low dispersities (&#272;&#8804;1.4). The optimized conditions showed efficiency comparable to that achieved with Grubbs&#8217; 2nd generation catalyst for the polymerization of 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;phenylcyclopropene. A positive correlation between monomer to initiator ratio and degree of polymerization was revealed through NMR spectroscopy.
