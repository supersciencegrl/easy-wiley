         <title>Lattice Modulation on Singlet&#8208;Triplet Splitting of Silver Cluster Boosting Near&#8208;Unity Photoluminescence Quantum Yield</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A TADF&#8208;active silver cluster exhibiting near&#8208;unity PLQY has been achieved through lattice modulation involving cation exchange followed by desolvation. The removal of the guest solvent via thermal activation in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SC&#8208;SC) transformation fashion effectively controls the singlet&#8208;triplet splitting and surpasses both phosphorescence and non&#8208;radiative decay of the clusters, thereby boosting the PLQY from 12% to near&#8208;unity.







Abstract
Developing thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)&#8208;active silver clusters with near&#8208;unity quantum efficiency is of practical importance in cutting&#8208;edge optoelectronic devices, but remains a tremendous challenge due to the difficulty of de novo synthesis and uncertainty of properties. Herein, we demonstrate a lattice modulation on parent TADF&#8208; active silver cluster, achieving TADF&#8208;driven photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) from 12&#8201;% to near&#8208;unity. Systematic experimental and calculated results reveal that the lattice modulation effectively lowers the singlet&#8208;triplet splitting (&#916;EST) from 718 to 549&#8197;cm&#8208;1, thereby facilitating thermally activated reverse intersystem crossing: T5&#8594;S5, leading to extremely efficient TADF by surpassing both phosphorescence and non&#8208;radiative decay, thus boosting the near&#8208;unity PLQY. Such high PLQY is extremely rare in the TADF&#8208;active silver clusters and even in the whole noble&#8208;metal clusters. This research showcases an unparalleled example of lattice modulation to realize near unity PLQY of TADF&#8208;active silver clusters.

         <title>Towards Highly Stable Sn2+ Electrolyte for Aqueous Tin Batteries Using Hydroquinone Antioxidant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By adding antioxidant (hydroquinone) additives to acidic Sn2+ electrolyte, Sn2+ oxidation was suppressed due to the fact that hydroquinone is able to react with dissolved oxygen. Meanwhile, hydroquinone molecules tend to adsorb on electrode surface, resulted in refined deposition Sn particles and inhibition on dendrite growth. Finally, high Coulombic efficiency of 99.9&#8201;% for Sn electrode can be obtained. This work can provide guidance for high stable Sn2+ electrolyte with high reversibility.







Abstract
Sn redox chemistry in aqueous acidic electrolyte was characterized with high reversibility and kinetics, which is considered as competitive anode material for aqueous batteries. Unfortunately, divalent Sn2+ is unstable in aqueous electrolyte. It was revealed that Sn2+ is easy to be oxidized to tetravalent Sn4+ by dissolved oxygen and then forms precipitate through hydrolysis process, leading to serious performance decay. Here, hydroquinone (HQ) was employed as antioxidant to prevent Sn2+ oxidation. With addition of HQ, Sn2+ electrolyte can maintain transparent and colorless after long&#8208;time exposure under air atmosphere, while large amounts of sediment were observed in the electrolyte without HQ. Moreover, HQ can adsorb on electrode surface to regulate Sn deposition and suppress Sn dendrite formation. With the difunctional HQ additive, Sn anode shows a stable cycling performance more than 1500 cycles with a high average coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.9&#8201;%. And the organic||Sn cell shows high cycling stability for 10,000 cycles with 71&#8201;% capacity retention. The hydroquinone antioxidant strategy provides a facile and cost&#8208;effective way to develop highly stable Sn2+&#8208;based electrolyte.

         <title>Conditional Relay Activation of Theranostic Prodrug by Pretargeting Bioorthogonal Trigger and Fluorescence&#8208;Guided Visible Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We devise a click&#8208;photo&#8208;activatable theranostic prodrug platform exemplified by tetrazine&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;conjugated SN&#8208;38 prodrug 1 with masked fluorescence, low cytotoxicity, and good photostability. Upon an IEDDA reaction between the tetrazine unit on the prodrug and a biotinylated trans&#8208;cyclooctene (biotin&#8208;TCO) on the tumor cell surface, the green fluorescence from BODIPY was fully restored for cell&#8208;selective imaging, which guided the green light irradiation to liberate the caged drug SN&#8208;38 exerting potent cytotoxicity against tumor cells.







Abstract
Bioorthogonalized light&#8208;responsive click&#8208;and&#8208;uncage platform has enabled precise cell surface engineering and timed payload release, but most of such photoactivatable prodrugs have &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; photoactivity leading to the dark toxicity. On the other hand, the conditionally activatable photocage is limited to the application of fluorogenic probe/photosensitizer liberation. Herein, we devise a conditionally activatable theranostic platform based on the tetrazine (Tz)&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) construct, in which tetrazine serves as a quencher motif to disable both the fluorescence and photoresponsivity of BODIPY. The uncaged BODIPY upon the bioorthogonal transformation of the tetrazine reinstates fluorescence on&#8208;target to guide the subsequent visible light irradiation thereby releasing the therapeutic payload in situ. The proof of concept for such &#8220;light where is lit up&#8221;&#8208;activated theranostics was demonstrated by the tetrazine&#8208;BODIPY conjugated SN&#8208;38 (1) with masked fluorescence, up to 70&#8197;times&#8208;reduced cytotoxicity, and good photostability. Upon an inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction between tetrazine unit on 1 and a biotinylated trans&#8208;cyclooctene (biotin&#8208;TCO) as a pretargeted trigger on tumor cell surface, the green fluorescence from BODIPY was fully restored for cell&#8208;selective imaging, which guided the green light irradiation (500&#8211;520&#8197;nm) to activate the caged drug SN&#8208;38 exerting potent cytotoxicity against tumor cells, offering high spatiotemporal precision of disease diagnosis and therapy.

         <title>Electrodriven ATP Synthesis via a Reconstructed Thylakoid Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve electrodriven ATP synthesis, we designed an ATP synthesis module by coupling electrochemical &#916;pH establishment with planar thylakoid membranes (pTMs). The &#916;pH drove the rotation of ATPase at the pTMs to synthesis ATP. This model provides a paradigm to ATP synthesis from electricity, thus bring opportunity in electricity&#8208;powered in vitro biotransformation systems.







Abstract
Nature produces ATP, the energy currency, by converting solar energy (photophosphorylation) and chemical energy (substrate&#8208;level phosphorylation and oxidative phosphorylation). Green electricity, as a significant and sustainable energy carrier, plays a crucial role in achieving a carbon&#8208;neutral society. In this work, we established and verified a novel electrodriven phosphorylation method. Spinach thylakoid membranes (TMs), enriched with ATPases, were isolated and constructed into planar TMs (pTMs) on a proton exchange membrane (PEM), effectively imparting the traditional PEM with the biological function of ATP regeneration. Following the optimization of TMs concentration and incubation time, the biological PEM was integrated into a two&#8208;compartment electrochemical cell, where ATP was successfully synthesized by ATPase of pTMs, triggered by the proton gradient potential generated during electrochemical water splitting. When a constant voltage of 3&#8197;V was applied to the electrochemical cells, ATP was synthesized at a rate of 3.16&#8197;&#956;M&#8201;min&#8722;1&#956;gChl&#8722;1, approximately twice the rate of &#916;pH&#8208;driven ATP synthesis. This design offers substantial potential for green energy applications in in vitro biotransformation (ivBT) systems.

         <title>Semiconductive Coordination Polymer with Multi&#8208;Channel Charge Transfer for High&#8208;Performance Direct X&#8208;ray Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of linker mediated electronic&#8208;state regulation was proposed to construct a CP with multi&#8208;channel charge transfer. This strategy reduced carrier losses resulting from recombination or quenching, enhanced the efficiency of charge separation and transfer. The semiconductive detector achieves the high mobility&#8208;lifetime product and the low detectable X&#8208;ray dose rate, which makes the record for CPs&#8208;based direct radiation detection.







Abstract
Coordination polymers (CPs) are promising for direct X&#8208;ray detection and imaging owing to higher designability and outstanding stability, however, it remains a challenge to achieve highly X&#8208;ray detection performance, particularly both high sensitivity and low detection limit at the same operating voltage. Herein, we construct a new conjugated CP {[Co(BPTTz)(DIPA)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;DMA}n (1, BPTTz=2,5&#8208;bis(pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;yl)thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole, H2DIPA=2,5&#8208;diiodoterephthalic acid, DMA=N, N&#8217;&#8208;dimethylacetamide), with multi&#8208;channel charge transfer by regulating the linker mediated electronic&#8208;state, which reduces carrier losses resulting from recombination or quenching, enhances the efficiency of charge separation and transfer, thus further optimizes X&#8208;ray detection performance. The semiconductor prepared based on this strategy achieves record values including the highest mobility&#8208;lifetime product (&#956;&#964;, 8.05&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1) and the lowest detectable X&#8208;ray dose rate (128&#8197;nGyair&#8201;S&#8722;1, 35&#8197;V) among CP&#8208;based direct radiation detectors, as well as a high sensitivity (172&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 35&#8197;V) at the same operating voltage. This detector shows excellent long&#8208;time air stability under ambient conditions for over three months and operational stability. These findings demonstrate a rational structural design method to enhance the photoelectronic efficiency and stability of semiconductive CPs.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells by Introducing a Multifunctional Surface Modulator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, we report an effective &#8220; three birds with one stone &#8221; strategy by utilizing sodium 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(1,4&#8208;phenylenebis(oxy))bis(butane&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonate) (ZR3) containing sulfonic acid groups (SO3&#8722;) and Na+ ions as a multifunctional surface treatment modulator to address the iodide and Pb&#8208;related defects, and Li+ ions migration suppression simultaneously. Consequently, highly efficient and stable PSCs are achieved.







Abstract
Simultaneously passivating the perovskite surface defects and suppressing Li+ ions diffusion of hole transport layer (HTL) are still challenging issues. Herein, we report an effective &#8220; three birds with one stone &#8221; strategy by utilizing sodium 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(1,4&#8208;phenylenebis(oxy))bis(butane&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonate) (ZR3) containing sulfonic acid groups (SO3&#8722;) and Na+ ions as a multifunctional surface treatment modulator to simultaneously address the above issues. It is found that ZR3 is not only capable of passivating the Pb&#8208;related defects at the surface of perovskite by the SO3&#8722; group, but also possesses the remarkable ability to passivate the halide defects with Na+ ions. Meanwhile, ZR3 treatment enables the enhanced exciton dissociation of perovskite, better energy level alignment with hole transport layer (HTL), improved hole extraction/transfer from perovskite layer into HTL, and reduced charge carrier recombination in device. Therefore, it results in the enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.34&#8201;% in ZR3&#8208;based n&#8208;i&#8208;p device from 22.97&#8201;% for the control device. Specifically, p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs with ZR3 also achieves an improved PCE of 25.96&#8201;% with respect to the pristine one (23.99&#8201;%), proving the universality of ZR3 for PSCs. Moreover, the stabilities of ZR3&#8208;treated devices are significantly enhanced owing to Li+ ions migration suppressing and perovskite defects reduction.

         <title>Hydrogen/Electron Amphiphilic Bi&#8208;Functional Water Molecular Inactivator&#8208;Assisted Interface Stabilization in Highly Reversible Zn Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the suppression principle, PD with both electron and proton affinity can simultaneously suppress H2O activity and enhance interface stability. Specifically, the proton affinity could break H2O&#8208;rich hydrogen bond network to terminate proton transport in bulk electrolyte, and electron affinity guaranteed the competitive chemistry with H2O molecules to enable stable electrolyte&#8208;electrode interface for aqueous zinc metal battery.







Abstract
Continuous hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;network in aqueous electrolytes can lead to uncontrollable hydrogen transfer, and combining the interfacial parasitic electron consumption cause the side reaction in aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs). Herein, hydrogen/electron amphiphilic bi&#8208;functional 1,5&#8208;Pentanediol (PD) molecule was introduced to stabilize the electrode/electrolyte interface. Stronger proton affinity of &#8208;OH in PD can break bulk&#8208;H2O hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;network to inhibit the activity of water, and electron affinity can enhance electron acceptation capability, which ensures that PD is preferentially bound to electrode material over H2O. Besides, the participation of PD in the Zn2+ solvation structure reduces water content at the solid&#8211;liquid interface and promotes uniform deposition process by optimizing Zn2+ de&#8208;solvation energy. Accordingly, dense and vertical zinc texture based on intrinsic steric hindrance effect of PD and formed SEI protective layer to induce stable Zinc anode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Moreover, an organic&#8211;inorganic shielding water layer was formed at the cathode side to suppress vanadium dissolution in vanadium Oxide. Consequently, Zn//Zn symmetric cell could cycle for more than 5600&#8197;hours at 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2@1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (more than 250&#8197;hours at 50&#8201;&#176;C). Besides, the VO2 and I2 cathode all achieved stable cycling performance and former pouch cell could reach average capacity of 0.13 Ah.

         <title>Cleavage and Reassembly of 1,3&#8208;Dicarbonyls with Enaminones to Synthesize Highly Functionalized Naphthols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tandem assembly of 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls and enaminones into highly functionalized naphthols has been developed in a process that stands out for the readily accessible raw materials, simple operation in the atmosphere, and excellent substrate compatibility. The products can easily be converted into drug scaffolds.







Abstract
The cleavage of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds and their subsequent reassembly into highly functionalized and useful molecules in an atom&#8208;efficient manner has always been a central focus in the realm of organic synthesis. In this report, we describe the construction of highly functionalized naphthol esters via a tandem reassembly process, driven by Ullmann&#8208;type coupling of enaminones and 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds. Mechanistic investigations suggest the involvement of C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp3) coupling, cyclization, two acyl migrations, aromatization, and additional transformations within this tandem sequence. This methodology offers several notable advantages, such as the use of inexpensive and easily accessible starting materials, the elimination of the need for expensive transition metal catalysis, simple operation in the atmosphere, exceptional compatibility with a wide range of substrates, and ease of conversion into drug scaffolds.

The partially interstitial silicon implanted ruthenium not only converts the Ru&#8208;top sites from recessive to dominant catalytic sites but also preserves the low water dissociation energy barrier at the Ru surface. In addition, the spontaneously generated built&#8208;in electric fields bidirectionally optimize the adsorption property of the Ru sites, further significantly lowering the thermodynamic energy barrier for the alkaline HER.







Abstract
To enhance the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), it is crucial, yet challenging, to fundamentally understand and rationally modulate potential catalytic sites. In this study, we confirm that despite calculating a low water dissociation energy barrier and an appropriate H adsorption free energy (&#916;G*H) at Ru&#8208;top sites, metallic Ru exhibits a relatively inferior activity for the alkaline HER. This is primarily because the Ru&#8208;top sites, which are potential H adsorption sites, are recessive catalytic sites, compared with the adjacent Ru&#8208;hollow sites that have a strong &#916;G*H. To promote the transformation of Ru&#8208;top sites from recessive to dominant catalytic sites, interstitial Si atoms are implanted into the hollow sites. However, complete interstitial implantation leads to a high water dissociation energy barrier at the RuSi intermetallic surface. Thus, we present a partial interstitial incorporation strategy to form a Ru&#8722;RuSi heterostructure that not only converts the Ru&#8208;top sites from recessive to dominant catalytic sites but also preserves the low water dissociation energy barrier at the Ru surface. Moreover, the spontaneously formed built&#8208;in electric fields bidirectionally optimize the adsorption ability of the Ru sites, thereby greatly reducing the thermodynamic energy barrier and enhancing the alkaline HER.

         <title>Boosting the Performance of Iridium Single Atom Catalyst in a Porous Organic Polymer for Glycerol Conversion to Lactic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single Atom Catalysts (SACs) are a promising frontier in heterogeneous catalysis, combining the advantages of both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems with high active metal site dispersion. A novel, stable Iridium (Ir) SAC catalyst synthesized by directly incorporating an active Ir complex within a porous organic polymer matrix exhibits exceptional efficiency and selectivity in converting glycerol to lactic acid.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) inherit the merit of both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems with atomically dispersed mononuclear metal centers on the solid supports. Herein, we developed an Ir&#8208;SAC catalyst via the polymerization of an active homogeneous 2&#8208;picolinylhydrazone ligand&#8208;based iridium (Ir) metal complex. Such catalysts provide great stabilization against migration and agglomeration due to the strong covalent C&#8722;C bond linkage of active complexes and the polymer matrix. This Ir&#8208;SAC catalyst shows excellent selectivity towards glycerol to lactic acid conversion with a remarkable recyclability to offer an unprecedentedly high TON of over 104 million under optimized conditions.

         <title>Programmable Modular Assembly of Homochiral Ir(III)&#8208;Metallohelices to Reverse Metallodrug Resistance by Inhibiting CDK1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel programmable modular assembly approach was developed for the construction of homochiral, luminescent dinuclear Ir(III) metallohelices with flexible dithiourea linkages. The metallohelices exhibit significant chirality&#8208;dependent photocytotoxicities and CDK1&#8208;specific targeting ability, offering innovative insights into the design of chiral helical metallodrugs aimed at reversing metallodrug resistance.







Abstract
Drug resistance is a major cause of cancer recurrence and poor prognosis. The innovative design and synthesis of inhibitors to target drug&#8208;resistance&#8208;specific proteins is highly desirable. However, challenges remain in precisely adjusting their conformation and stereochemistry to adapt the chiral regions of target proteins. Herein, using a stepwise programmable modular assembly approach, we precisely engineered two pairs of homochiral dinuclear Ir(III) metallohelices (&#923;2S4&#8208;Hbpy and &#916;2R4&#8208;Hbpy, &#916;2S4&#8208;Hbpy and &#923;2R4&#8208;Hbpy) functionalized with flexible dithiourea linkages. The resulting homochiral metallohelices exhibited significant chirality&#8208;dependent photocytotoxicities, and the enhanced structural compatibility of &#916;2S4&#8208;Hbpy with the target cyclin&#8208;dependent kinase&#8197;1 (CDK1) contributed to its superior photodynamic therapy efficacy, achieving an outstanding photocytotoxicity index (PI) value of 2.3&#215;104. Interestingly, emerging as a critical mediator in the development of oxaliplatin resistance, CDK1 targeting by &#916;2S4&#8208;Hbpy achieved enhanced cellular uptake, anticancer activity, and oncosis&#8208;mediated cell death in oxaliplatin&#8208;resistant HCT&#8208;8/L cells. Mechanistic investigations, including proteomic profiling and CDK1 gene silencing, confirmed the pivotal role of chirality&#8208;selective CDK1 targeting in reversing metallodrug resistance. This study introduces a promising platform for constructing and customizing flexible metallohelices with precise conformation and stereochemistry to target drug&#8208;resistance&#8208;specific proteins, offering innovative insights into the designability of metallodrugs to overcome drug resistance.

         <title>Liquid Crystalline Nanorods by Synchronized Polymerization, Self&#8208;Assembly and Oriented Attachment for Utilization in Magnetically Responsive Displays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step strategy based on oriented attachment, synchronized with polymerization and self&#8208;assembly was reported to achieve single&#8208;domain smectic liquid crystalline (LC) homopolymer nanorods. The strategy was realized by developing a novel stabilizer derived from a thermo&#8208;responsive polyelectrolyte system. The resulting LC nanorods further form hierarchical colloidal LCs, which show much larger light transmittance than that of non&#8208;LC nanorods.







Abstract
The creation of anisotropic nanoparticles (NPs) by polymerization and/or self&#8208;assembly (SA) has significantly promoted the applications of polymer nanomaterials in many fields. However, polymer nanorods are not easily accessible via conventional polymerization or SA. Here we report a one&#8208;step route to synthesize single&#8208;domain smectic liquid crystalline (LC) nanorods utilizing oriented attachment (OA) that was usually found in the synthesis of inorganic NPs, synchronized with polymerization and SA. The synchronization was achieved by developing a novel stabilizer derived from a thermo&#8208;responsive polyelectrolyte system. Mechanistic studies reveal that controlling the thermo&#8208;responsive behavior and the distribution of stabilizers on NPs enabled OA. The LC nanorods can further form hierarchical colloidal LCs, which show much larger light transmittance than that of non&#8208;LC nanorods. Moreover, we demonstrate that this LC system can be manipulated by an external magnetic field, thus providing a candidate material for magnetic&#8208;responsive display.

         <title>Synthesis of Arenesulfenyl Fluorides and Fluorosulfenylation of Alkenes, Alkynes, and &#945;&#8208;Diazocarbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and isolation of arenesulfenyl fluorides (ArS&#8208;F) has been achieved via a Halex reaction. Several arenesulfenyl fluorides have been characterized by NMR, UV&#8208;Vis, and FTIR spectroscopy, including structural analysis of two compounds by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The functional group engages in direct, efficient, and highly regioselective&#160;anti&#8208;addition to alkenes and alkynes, as well as insertion by carbenes.







Abstract
Sulfenyl fluorides are organic compounds of sulfur in formal oxidation state +2 with the formula R&#8722;S&#8722;F. Although the chloride, bromide, and iodide analogues have been extensively described in the literature, arenesulfenyl fluorides remain essentially unstudied. These structures have been implicated as putative intermediates in established processes to access polyfluorinated sulfur species; however, definitive and direct evidence of their existence has not been obtained, nor has a systematic understanding of their reactivity. Here, we report the synthesis, isolation, and spectroscopic characterization of several arenesulfenyl fluorides, including structural analysis of 2,4&#8208;dinitrobenzenesulfenyl fluoride and 4&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzenesulfenyl fluoride by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The functional group undergoes direct, efficient, and highly regioselective anti&#8208;addition to alkenes and alkynes, as well as insertion by carbenes. The resulting &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;fluoro thioether adducts can be readily transformed into useful fluorinated motifs, for example by modification of the sulfur groups (to sulfonamides or sulfonyl fluorides), by sulfur elimination (to generate formal C&#8722;H fluorination products), or by Julia&#8211;Kocienski olefination (to form vinyl fluorides). Thus, we establish that sulfenyl fluorides are unexpectedly accessible and stable compounds, which serve as versatile reagents for the production of fluorinated organic compounds.

Several arenesulfenyl fluorides have been characterized by NMR, UV-Vis, and FTIR spectroscopy, including structural analysis of two compounds by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The functional group engages in direct, efficient, and highly regioselective&#160;&lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-addition to alkenes and alkynes, as well as insertion by carbenes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sulfenyl fluorides are organic compounds of sulfur in formal oxidation state +2 with the formula R&#8722;S&#8722;F. Although the chloride, bromide, and iodide analogues have been extensively described in the literature, arenesulfenyl fluorides remain essentially unstudied. These structures have been implicated as putative intermediates in established processes to access polyfluorinated sulfur species; however, definitive and direct evidence of their existence has not been obtained, nor has a systematic understanding of their reactivity. Here, we report the synthesis, isolation, and spectroscopic characterization of several arenesulfenyl fluorides, including structural analysis of 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfenyl fluoride and 4-cyano-2-nitrobenzenesulfenyl fluoride by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The functional group undergoes direct, efficient, and highly regioselective &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-addition to alkenes and alkynes, as well as insertion by carbenes. The resulting &#945;- or &#946;-fluoro thioether adducts can be readily transformed into useful fluorinated motifs, for example by modification of the sulfur groups (to sulfonamides or sulfonyl fluorides), by sulfur elimination (to generate formal C&#8722;H fluorination products), or by Julia&#8211;Kocienski olefination (to form vinyl fluorides). Thus, we establish that sulfenyl fluorides are unexpectedly accessible and stable compounds, which serve as versatile reagents for the production of fluorinated organic compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Swing Synthesis of Highly Crystalline Covalent Organic Framework Films for Fast and Precise Molecular Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleation and growth kinetics of COFs are regulated using the temperature&#8208;swing synthesis strategy, which contributes to highly crystalline and porous COF films. The regular channels within the COF enable fast solvent permeation and excellent selectivity to precisely discriminate fine antibiotic mixtures. This work paves the way towards the structural orderliness of framework materials.







Abstract
Producing crystalline covalent organic framework (COF) films is intimately related to the elusive nucleation and growth processes, which is desirable for efficient molecular transport. Rational control over these processes and insights into the mechanisms are crucial to improve synthetic methodology and achieve COF films with regular channels. Here, we report the controllable synthesis of COF films via the temperature&#8208;swing strategy and explore their crystallization from monomer assemblies to film formation. A detailed time&#8208;dependent study reveals that COF crystallites preferentially coalesce at low temperature, progressing from assembled nanospheres to continuous films through lateral and vertical interactions. Moreover, appropriately elevating the synthesis temperature promotes crystal growth and eliminate the defects of weakly crystalline regions, contributing to highly crystalline and porous COF film with a surface area of 746&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1. The prepared COF composite membrane exhibits a methanol permeance of 79&#8197;L m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 bar&#8722;1, which is 4.5 times higher than the weakly crystalline counterpart. In addition, the molecular sieving test recognize great membrane selectivity to discriminate the antibiotic mixture with a high separation factor of 15.4. This work offers a feasible way for the rational design of the synthesis environment, enabling access to highly crystalline framework materials for targeting molecular separations.

         <title>Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Amino Amides by Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Hydroamination of Internal Alkenes Directed by an Amide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unactivated internal alkenes were found to undergo enantioselective hydroamination catalyzed by a cationic iridium complex. An amide group effectively directs the catalyst to control the regioselectivity to over 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 and the enantioselectivity to up to 97&#8201;% ee. This coordination assistance enables hydroamination to occur selectively at the remote position, delivering valuable enantioenriched &#947;&#8208;amino acid derivatives that are otherwise challenging to access.







Abstract
Catalytic regio&#8208; and enantioselective hydroamination of less activated internal alkenes presents a challenge to synthetic chemists due to their low reactivity and the difficulty in simultaneously controlling regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. Here, we report an iridium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydroamination of internal alkenes directed by an amide. The amide group on the alkene effectively directs the catalyst to overcome the low reactivity and control the regioselectivity and the enantiotopic face selection. Phthalimide serves as the amination agent, which could be readily removed to afford a primary amine. This coordination assistance enables hydroamination to occur selectively at the remote position with up to 97&#8201;% ee, delivering valuable enantio&#8208;enriched &#947;&#8208;amino acid derivatives that are otherwise challenging to access.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Converting biomass&#8208;derived molecules like 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into value&#8208;added products alongside hydrogen production using renewable energy offers significant opportunities for sustainable chemical and energy production. Yet, HMF electrooxidation requires strong alkaline conditions and membranes for efficient conversion. These harsh conditions destabilize HMF, leading to humin formation and reduced product purity, meanwhile membranes increase costs. Addressing these challenges, we introduce a two&#8208;step, decoupling system that operates without strong alkaline conditions and eliminates the need of membranes. In this system, nickel&#8208;cobalt hydroxides serve as effective redox mediators, driving HMF oxidation in pure water. The experimental results showed that Ni0.85Co0.15OOH effectively promotes the dehydrogenation of substrate and achieves a highly efficient oxidation of HMF in pure water, with the selectivity of product 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) approaching 100%. This system has been expanded to oxidize various substrates, achieving yields exceeding 92% for the corresponding acids of functionalized compounds such as furfuryl alcohol, furfural, benzyl alcohol, and benzaldehyde. By replacing fixed electrodes with flow electrodes, the scalability of decoupling strategy was evaluated for the harvesting of pure solid FDCA, highlighting the broad prospects in practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalyzed Azidofunctionalization of Alkenes via Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The azidofunctionalization of alkenes using a hypervalent iodine reagent and various nucleophiles (Nu) under photoredox conditions is described. This method enables the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;difunctionalized products from a wide range of alkenes and nucleophiles significantly improving the synthesis of pharmaceutical intermediates. The generality and limitations of the approach in the alkene and nucleophile dimensions were examined through a standardized, unbiased substrate selection.







Abstract
The azidofunctionalization of alkenes under mild conditions using commercially available starting materials and easily accessible reagents is reported based on a radical&#8208;polar crossover strategy. A broad range of alkenes, including vinyl arenes, enamides, enol ethers, vinyl sulfides, and dehydroamino esters, were regioselectively functionalized with an azide and nucleophiles such as azoles, carboxylic acids, alcohols, phosphoric acids, oximes, and phenols. The method led to a more efficient synthesis of 1,2&#8208;azidofunctionalized pharmaceutical intermediates when compared to previous approaches, resulting in both reduction of step count and increase in overall yield. The scope and limitations of these transformations were further investigated through a standard unbiased selection of 15 substrate combinations out of 1,175,658 possible using a clustering technique.

         <title>&#8220;Double&#8208;Gene&#8221; Small Molecule as Guest Component Promotes the Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells Beyond 19.5%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Introduction of a guest component into the active layer is a simple yet effective approach to enhance the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Despite various guest components successfully employed in the OSCs, efficient guest components require deliberate design and ingenious inspiration, which still remains a big challenge for developing high performance OSCs. In this work, we propose a concept of &#8220;structural gene&#8221; engineering to create a new &#8220;double&#8208;gene&#8221; small molecule (L&#8208;DBDD) by simply combining the structures of both donor PM6 and acceptor L8&#8208;BO. L&#8208;DBDD inherit the features of both donor and acceptor, which naturally acts as a bridge between donor/acceptor (D/A) interfaces to strengthen D/A interactions and compatibility. Incorporation of this &#8220;double&#8208;gene&#8221; small molecule into the active layer can facilitate rapid charge dissociation and simultaneously optimize molecular packing for efficient charge transport. Consequently, the ternary OSC based on PM6: L&#8208;DBDD:L8&#8208;BO blend achieves a top power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.51%, significantly suppressing the binary control device (PCE=18.52%). These results demonstrate that the design concept of &#8220;double&#8208;gene&#8221; small molecule by combination of the &#8220;structural gene&#8221; of donor and acceptor provides a simple and meaningful guideline for guest component&#8208;assisted highly efficient OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>An Efficient Ultra&#8208;Narrowband Yellow Emitter Based on a Double&#8208;Boron&#8208;Embedded&#160;Tetraazacyclophane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultra&#8208;narrowband and highly modifiable multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials are crucial for realizing high&#8208;performance wide&#8208;color&#8208;gamut display applications. Despite progress, most MR&#8208;TADF emitters remain confined to blue and green wavelengths, with difficulties extending into longer wavelengths without significant spectral broadening, which compromises color purity in full&#8208;color organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) displays. In this work, we present a novel tetraazacyclophane&#8208;based architecture embedding dual boron atoms to remarkedly enhance intramolecular charge transfer through the strategic positioning of boron and nitrogen atoms. This arrangement induces a substantial redshift while maintaining structural rigidity and molecular orbital symmetry, with a hole&#8208;electron central distance of 0 &#197;, allowing for ultra&#8208;narrowband emission. The resulting MR&#8208;TADF material, HBN, delivers yellow emission peaking at 572 nm (2.168 eV) with an impressively narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 17 nm (0.064 eV) in dilute toluene. Moreover, the corresponding phosphorescent&#8208;sensitized fluorescence OLED achieves yellow emission maximum at 581 nm, with a narrow FWHM of 25 nm, a high maximum external quantum efficiency of 36.1%, and a luminance exceeding 40,000 cd m&#8208;2. These outstanding photoluminescent and electroluminescent performances validate the superiority of our molecular design strategy, highlighting its significant potential for cutting&#8208;edge optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Phase&#8208;Separated Spiropyran Coacervates as Dual&#8208;Wavelength&#8208;Switchable Reactive Oxygen Generators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight compounds of certain structural features may form coacervates through liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS). These coacervates can enter mammalian cells and affect cellular physiology. Controlling the properties of the coacervates inside cells, however, is a challenge. Here, we report photochemical reactions of spiropyran (SP)&#8208;based coacervates with two wavelengths of light, in vitro, in the cell, and in animals, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) for photo&#8208;controlled cell killing. We identify an SP&#8208;containing compound, SP&#8208;PEG8&#8208;SP, that forms coacervates (SP&#8208;C) in the aqueous solution. Photo illumination by a UV light triggers the isomerization of SP to merocyanine (MC), switching SP&#8208;C to the fluorescent coacervates MC&#8208;C. A visible light converts MC&#8208;C back to SP&#8208;C and induces ROS generation. Notably, coacervate formation increases the compound's ROS generation efficiency. The SP&#8208;C/MC&#8208;C coacervate system (collectively called spiropyran coacervates) can spontaneously enter cells, and a dual&#8208;wavelength&#8208;controlled reversible on/off switch and spatiotemporal&#8208;resolved ROS production is realized within the cytoplasm. Light&#8208;induced ROS generation leads to cytotoxicity to cancer cells, tumor organoids, and tumors in vivo, supporting spiropyran coacervates&#8217; potential use as coacervate photosensitizers in photodynamic therapies.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Linear Tetramer&#8208;type Acceptors for High&#8208;efficiency and High&#8208;stability Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs) has exceeded 20%, which has met the requirements for commercialisation. In the current stage, the main focus is to balance the performance and stability. It has been shown that all&#8208;polymer formulation can improve device stability, however, PCE is not in satifsfaction, and the batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variation leads to quality control issues. In this work, we constructed monodispersed tetramer NFA materials named G&#8208;1 and G&#8208;2, to best integrate the merits of small molecule and polymer. It was revealed that different connecting units at the centre could significantly affect the molecular planarity and thin film morphology. The alkene&#8208;bonded tetramer G&#8208;1 had a more regioregular structure, leading to better molecular planarity, and more ordered packing in thin film. More importantly, the oligomeration induced a favourable face&#8208;on orientation, achieved a lower binding energy and a higher photoluminescence yield. As a result, the exciton and charge carrier kinetics was optimized with reduced non&#8208;radiative energy loss. The OSC based on PM6:G&#8208;1 achieved a PCE of 19.6%, which is the highest PCE reported so far for oligomer&#8208;based binary OSC. In addition, the device stability was largely improved, showing a lifetime over 10000 hours in the inverted OSC device.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective [3+2] Annulation of Aldimines with Alkynes by Scandium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enantioselective [3+2] annulation of readily accessible aldimines with alkynes via C&#8211;H activation is, in principle, a straightforward and atom&#8208;efficient route for synthesizing chiral 1&#8208;aminoindenes, which are important components in a wide array of natural products, bioactive molecules, and functional materials. However, such asymmetric transformation has remained undeveloped to date due to the lack of suitable chiral catalysts. Here, we report for the first time the enantioselective [3+2] annulation of aldimines with alkynes via C&#8211;H activation using chiral half&#8208;sandwich scandium catalysts. This protocol enabled the synthesis of diverse multi&#8208;substituted chiral 1&#8208;aminoindene derivatives with 100% atom&#8208;efficiency, broad substrate scope, and high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Density functional theory (DFT) analyses have revealed that a noncovalent C&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interaction between a tert&#8208;Bu substituent in the chiral cyclopentadienyl (Cp) ligand and the phenyl ring of an aromatic aldimine substrate played an important role in achieving a high level of enantioselectivity. This work not only offers an efficient and selective route for synthesizing a new family of chiral 1&#8208;aminoindene derivatives but also offers unprecedented insights into enantioselectivity control in chiral Cp&#8208;ligated metal catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient and Robust Europium(III)&#8208;Based Hybrid Lanthanide Scintillators for Advanced X&#8208;ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Scintillators that convert ionizing radiation into low&#8208;energy photons are essential for medical diagnostics and industrial inspections. Despite advances in X&#8208;ray scintillators, challenges remain in achieving high efficiency, environmental compatibility, stability, and flexibility. Here, we present experimental investigations of a new type of europium(III)&#8208;based hybrid ternary complex scintillators for improved X&#8208;ray detection and imaging. Benefiting from the synergistic interaction between dual organic ligands and lanthanide ions, the Eu(TTA)3Phen complex demonstrates exceptional radioluminescence and light yield under X&#8208;ray excitation, with a detection limit of 19.97 nGy s&#8722;1, well below typical radiation doses used in medical diagnostics. Moreover, lanthanide complex Eu(TTA)3Phen exhibited excellent thermal and photostability, showing minimal degradation even after extended X&#8208;ray exposure. By integrating with flexible polymer matrices, a high&#8208;transmission Eu(TTA)3Phen&#8208;PMMA composite film was fabricated for X&#8208;ray radiography, demonstrating high spatial resolution (&lt; 10 um) and superior image quality across various target samples. These findings hold substantial promise for next&#8208;generation X&#8208;ray imaging applications, offering high sensitivity, stability, flexibility, and versatility, making them ideally suited for advanced radiographic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Autocatalytic Interfacial Synthesis of Self&#8208;Standing Amide&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of crystalline covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has in principle relied on reversible dynamic chemistry. A general method to synthesize irreversibly bonded COFs is urgently demanded for driving the COF chemistry to a new era. Here we report a universal two&#8208;step method for the straightforward synthesis of irreversibly amide&#8208;linked COF (AmCOF) membranes by autocatalytic interfacial polymerization (AIP). Highly crystalline amide and imine bilinker COF (AICOF) membranes are readily synthesized by AIP strategy which ingeniously leverages interfacial polymerization to generate amide units followed by an autocatalytic condensation that forms imine bonds. Then, the fully amide&#8208;linked AmCOF membranes with Turing structures can be prepared through irreversible linker renovation. The universality of this method has been exemplified by nine AmCOF membranes.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of crystalline covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has in principle relied on reversible dynamic chemistry. A general method to synthesize irreversibly bonded COFs is urgently demanded for driving the COF chemistry to a new era. Here we report a universal two-step method for the straightforward synthesis of irreversibly amide-linked COF (AmCOF) membranes by autocatalytic interfacial polymerization (AIP). Highly crystalline amide and imine bilinker COF (AICOF) membranes are readily synthesized by AIP strategy which ingeniously leverages interfacial polymerization to generate amide units followed by an autocatalytic condensation that forms imine bonds. Then, the fully amide-linked AmCOF membranes with Turing structures can be prepared through irreversible linker renovation. The universality of this method has been exemplified by nine AmCOF membranes. Among them, the AmCOF-1 membrane exhibits superior performance for H2O2 photosynthesis (4353 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) and high stability, enabling continuous production of H2O2 under sunlight for 150 h without sacrificial agents. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the greatly improved properties are attributable to the built-in robust amide knots, facilitating full separation of electrons and holes, ultra-long exciton diffusion length, and fast dissociation of excitons within the AmCOF channels.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Scrolled Poly(L&#8208;lactic acid) Single Crystals via Chain End&#8208;Induced Symmetry&#8208;Breaking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single crystals that do not obey translational symmetry have been reported in various material systems. In polymers, twisted crystals are typically formed in banded spherulites, while a class of non&#8208;flat polymer single crystals (PSCs) has been observed. Herein, we report the formation of scrolled single crystals of biodegradable polymer poly(L&#8208;lactic acid) (PLLA). While classical 2&#8208;dimensional single crystals formed in solution&#8208;crystallized PLLA are flat, we show that PLLA crystals bend into scrolls in low molar mass PLLA. The formation of these unique scrolled PLLA single crystals depends on polymer chain ends and the polymer molecular weight. This work, therefore, demonstrates a new mechanism to break translational symmetry in PSC growth.</dc:description>

         <title>From Guest&#8208;Induced Crystallization to Molecular Imprinting: Calculation&#8208;Guided Discovery of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Tetrazole Frameworks for p&#8208;Xylene Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring host&#8208;guest interactions to regulate hydrogen&#8208;bonding assembly offers a promising approach for developing advanced porous crystal materials (PCMs). However, screening compatible guests with appropriate geometries and host&#8208;guest interactions that could inhibit the dense packing of building blocks remains a primary challenge. This study presents a novel guest&#8208;induced crystallization (GIC) strategy, guided by thermodynamic calculations, to develop porous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) using structurally challenging tetrazole building units. Thermodynamic principles are established from the crystal structure data and the density functional theory calculation of the formation energy (&#916;E). This provides criteria to identify available guests in GIC, enabling the successful discovery of a hidden HOF that is kinetically challenging to crystallize. Furthermore, the potential application for p&#8208;xylene (PX) separation is predicted by analyzing the &#916;E of guest&#8208;induced HOFs. A high PX selectivity (PX/m&#8208;xylene=6.1, PX/o&#8208;xylene=7.2, and PX/ethylbenzene=4.1) is achieved through selective inclusion of PX from C8 aromatic isomers within the guest&#8208;induced HOFs. Significantly, the guest&#8208;free HOF (HOF&#8208;PX&#8208;a), bearing PX&#8208;templated cavities derived from molecular imprinting, shows a record&#8208;high PX/ethylbenzene selectivity (21.7) in liquid adsorption. This work elucidates the underpinning self&#8208;assembly rules of GIC for HOF construction, providing exciting new opportunities for the predictable assembly of PCMs for molecular recognition and target&#8208;specific separations.</dc:description>

         <title>Initiator&#8208;Free Thiol&#8208;Aldehyde Photo Polycondensation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional photopolymerizations generally requires an initiator for initiating the polymerization while few cases have created degradable chemical bonds. Moreover, the migration instability and cytotoxicity of photo initiators are posing issues to human health and the environment. In this work, we discovered an initiator&#8208;free photo polycondensation system (IFPPC) between polymercaptans and aldehyde monomers, producing high strength plastic materials with exchangeable and degradable dithioacetal groups. IFPPC proceeds through a radical mechanism and is applicable in producing linear polymers and crosslinked networks. Nano&#8208;composites can also be obtained via an organic solvent&#8208;free Pickering emulsion polymerization using cellulose nanofibers as the stabilizer. The dithioacetal groups afford excellent stability under hydrolytic conditions and repeated thermal processing of cross&#8208;linked polymers, while their cleavage in aqueous solution of salts (silver nitrate, zinc iodide, copper bromide, etc.) results in fast degradation for recovering the aldehyde monomer. This is a successful demonstration of producing recyclable and degradable plastics through photo irradiation while avoiding the problematic issues of photo initiators.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Spiropyran Exchange for Rapid Structural Diversification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we disclose that spiropyrans are able to undergo dynamic covalent exchange via their corresponding merocyanine isomers. In the latter, the indolinium moieties can be exchanged by a Michael&#8208;type addition&#8208;elimination sequence, in which a methylene indoline attacks a merocyanine and subsequently the initial indoline fragment is cleaved. The rate and position of the exchange equilibrium strongly depend on the reaction conditions as well as the substitution pattern on the methylene indoline fragments. Importantly, spiropyran cross exchange is catalyzed by indolinium salts and provides the opportunity for rapid in&#8208;situ structural diversification of spiropyrans. This was used as synthetic tool to access various, hitherto inaccessible spiropyrans as potential dual&#8208;color photoinitiators for xolography. Moreover, we foresee application to screen dynamic covalent libraries of spiropyrans for photochromic properties and to exploit their light&#8208;sensitivity to bias the thermal equilibrium.</dc:description>

         <title>The Amplification of Alpha&#8208;Synuclein Amyloid Fibrils is Suppressed under Fully Quiescent Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Digital seed amplification assays in microemulsion droplets for the diagnostics of Parkinson's disease would be highly valuable. However, such assays are rendered challenging by the fact that fibril amplification by fragmentation or secondary nucleation is strongly suppressed under the fully quiescent conditions inside the droplets. Ultrasonic agitation allowed the successful amplification of pre&#8208;formed seeds and those from PD brains inside microemulsion droplets under acidic solution conditions.







Abstract
Seed amplification assays (SAAs) are a promising avenue for the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. However, when amplifying fibrils from patient&#8208;derived samples in multiwell plates, it is currently highly challenging to accurately quantify the aggregates. It is therefore desirable to transfer such assays into a digital format in microemulsion droplets to enable direct quantification of aggregate numbers. To achieve transfer from conventional plate&#8208;based to the microfluidic digital format, effective seed amplification needs to be achieved inside the microdroplets. Therefore, we establish a new set of assay conditions that enable highly efficient seed amplification in plates without any shaking. However, the same set of conditions displayed a very different behavior upon transfer to a microfluidic platform where no amplification was observed. We demonstrate that this is caused by the suppression of all secondary processes that could amplify the seeds in the complete absence of mechanical perturbations inside the microdroplets. We further show that the amplification inside droplets can be achieved by subjecting the microemulsions to high&#8208;frequency vibrations using a piezo device. Taken together, our results provide novel insights into the physical requirements of alpha&#8208;synuclein seed amplification and demonstrate a pathway towards the development of effective digital SAAs.

         <title>Polymer Films&#8217; Residual Stress Attenuation from the Supramolecular Complexation with Ultra&#8208;Small Nanoparticles for High Resolution Nanoimprint Lithography</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of ultra&#8208;small nanoparticles can significantly alter the dynamics and physicochemical properties of polymers compared to colloid NPs due to their comparable sizes with characteristic lengths of polymer chain segment and the dense supramolecular interaction with polymers. This effect facilitates the fabrication of residual stress&#8208;free polymer films with high mechanical strengths, enabling unique application for low&#8208;cost, sub&#8208;2&#8197;nm resolution NIL.







Abstract
Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) has been broadly applied in the fabrication of nano&#8208;patterned polymer films for cost&#8208;efficiency and high through&#8208;put; however, the intrinsic tradeoff between mechanical strength and residual stress of polymer films significantly limits the NIL resolution while the harsh processing conditions limit its versatile applications to different substrates. Herein, 1&#8197;nm metal oxide cluster, phosphotungstic acid (PTA), is used to complex with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) for high&#8208;resolution NIL that can be operated at large&#8208;scale and mild conditions. The ultra&#8208;small size of PTA enables dense supramolecular interaction with PVA for the diminished crystallinity and accelerated chain dynamics that help relax the residual stress during film casting. Meanwhile, the PTAs serve as supramolecular crosslinkers for the increased modulus of the films (ca. 2&#8197;GPa), providing promising dimensional stability required for high&#8208;resolution NIL. Simple casting the aqueous blend on a master mold successfully gives a residual stress&#8208;free film with sub&#8208;2&#8197;nm resolution at wafer scale (&gt;100&#8197;cm2). The mild processing at ambient condition permits broad NIL applications to diverse substrates, e.g., integrated circuit chips, compact discs, PET nano gratings and even delicate bio&#8208;surfaces.

&lt;p&gt;The application of ultra-small nanoparticles can significantly alter the dynamics and physicochemical properties of polymers compared to colloid NPs due to their comparable sizes with characteristic lengths of polymer chain segment and the dense supramolecular interaction with polymers. This effect facilitates the fabrication of residual stress-free polymer films with high mechanical strengths, enabling unique application for low-cost, sub-2&#8197;nm resolution NIL.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) has been broadly applied in the fabrication of nano-patterned polymer films for cost-efficiency and high through-put; however, the intrinsic tradeoff between mechanical strength and residual stress of polymer films significantly limits the NIL resolution while the harsh processing conditions limit its versatile applications to different substrates. Herein, 1&#8197;nm metal oxide cluster, phosphotungstic acid (PTA), is used to complex with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) for high-resolution NIL that can be operated at large-scale and mild conditions. The ultra-small size of PTA enables dense supramolecular interaction with PVA for the diminished crystallinity and accelerated chain dynamics that help relax the residual stress during film casting. Meanwhile, the PTAs serve as supramolecular crosslinkers for the increased modulus of the films (ca. 2&#8197;GPa), providing promising dimensional stability required for high-resolution NIL. Simple casting the aqueous blend on a master mold successfully gives a residual stress-free film with sub-2&#8197;nm resolution at wafer scale (&amp;gt;100&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The mild processing at ambient condition permits broad NIL applications to diverse substrates, e.g., integrated circuit chips, compact discs, PET nano gratings and even delicate bio-surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts on C3N4: Minimizing Single Atom Pt Loading for Maximized Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt single atoms are successfully anchored onto C3N4 through a reactive deposition approach, achieving optimal positioning of Pt atoms in the most stable and active configurations. This strategy results in maximized photocatalytic H2 production efficiency at a low Pt loading of approximately 0.03&#8197;wt&#8201;%.







Abstract
The use of metal single atoms (SAs) as co&#8208;catalysts on semiconductors has emerged as a promising technology to enhance their photocatalytic hydrogen production performance. In this study, we describe the deposition of very low amounts of Pt SAs (&lt;0.1&#8201;at&#8201;%) on exfoliated graphitic carbon nitride (C3N4) by a direct Pt&#8722;deposition approach from highly dilute chloroplatinic acid precursors. We find that &#8722; using this technique&#8722;a remarkably low loading of highly dispersed Pt SAs (0.03&#8197;wt&#8201;%) on C3N4 is sufficient to achieve a drastic decrease in the overall charge transfer resistance and a maximized photocatalytic efficiency. The resulting low&#8208;loaded Pt SAs/C3N4 provides a H2 production rate of 1.66&#8197;m&#8201;mol/h/mg&#8197;Pt, with a remarkable stability against agglomeration; even during prolonged photocatalytic reactions no sign of light&#8208;induced Pt agglomerations can be observed. We ascribe the high performance and stability to the site&#8208;selective, stable coordination of Pt within the C3N4 structure. Notably the H2 production rate of the low&#8208;loaded Pt SAs surpasses the activity of Pt SAs deposited by other techniques or nanoparticles at comparable or even higher loading &#8211; the optimized Pt SAs decorated C3N4 show &#8776;5.9 times higher rate than Pt NP decorated C3N4.

A photochromic dysprosium&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule magnet displays reversible redox transformation upon ultraviolet irradiation and subsequent dark treatment, leading to a significant change of magnetic memory effect.







Abstract
A photochromic dysprosium&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule magnet [Dy(CyPh2PO)2(H2O)5](PMo12O40)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3CyPh2PO&#8901;H2O (1&#8208;Dy) is synthesized via cocrystal engineering of a polyoxomolybdate (POMo) anion and an Ising&#8208;type cation with pseudo pentagonal bipyramidal geometry. Upon ultraviolet irradiation, MoVI&#8208;to&#8208;MoV single&#8208;electron photoreduction occurs in the POMo moiety, resulting in significant changes of optical and magnetic properties. The emergence of intervalence charge&#8208;transfer transitions in heteropoly blue state 1&#8208;Dy* facilitates photothermal conversion in near&#8208;infrared region. Meanwhile, the coercive field of hysteresis loop is altered from 0.72&#8197;T (1&#8208;Dy) to 0.04&#8197;T (1&#8208;Dy*) at 2&#8197;K, which might be contributed to the magnetic interaction between DyIII and MoV. After dark treatment, 1&#8208;Dy* can convert to the initial state with the recovery of magnetic memory effect. These results presented herein provide a blueprint for developing versatile opto&#8208;magnetic materials via the coupling of photochemical regulation and magnetic interaction.

         <title>Balancing Activity and Selectivity in Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction through First Coordination Shell Engineering in Cobalt Single Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co single&#8208;atom sites with different N/O coordination are synthesized using a precursor preselection strategy to investigate their effect on selectivity and activity in the two&#8208;electron ORR. The trans&#8208;Co&#8208;N2O2 site achieves an optimal balance between selectivity and activity, reaching a H2O2 production rate of 12.86&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat.&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and an energy efficiency of 0.07&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat.&#8722;1&#8201;J&#8722;1 in a 100&#8208;hour flow&#8208;cell test.







Abstract
The electrochemical two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) offers a potentially cost&#8208;effective and eco&#8208;friendly route for the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). However, the competing 4e&#8722; ORR that converts oxygen to water limits the selectivity towards hydrogen peroxide. Accordingly, achieving highly selective H2O2 production under low voltage conditions remains challenging. Herein, guided by first&#8208;principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we show that modulation the first coordination sphere in Co single atom catalysts (Co&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts with Co&#8208;NxO4&#8208;x sites), specifically the replacement of Co&#8722;N bonds with Co&#8722;O bonds, can weaken the *OOH adsorption strength to boost the selectivity towards H2O2 (albeit with a slight decrease in ORR activity). Further, by synthesizing a series of N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported catalysts with Co&#8208;NxO4&#8208;x active sites, we were able to validate the DFT findings and explore the trade&#8208;off between catalytic activity and selectivity for 2e&#8722; ORR. A catalyst with trans&#8208;Co&#8208;N2O2 sites exhibited excellent catalytic activity and H2O2 selectivity, affording a H2O2 production rate of 12.86&#8197;

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generic incorporation of a thioxanthone&#8208;containing amino acid into a protein scaffold is described. The resulting artificial photoenzyme was engineered to catalyze a dearomative [2+2] cycloaddition reaction in high yields with excellent enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Genetically encodable photosensitizers allow the design of artificial photoenzymes to expand the scope of abiological reactions. Herein, we report the genetic incorporation of a thioxanthone&#8208;containing amino acid into a protein scaffold via an engineered pyrrolysyl&#8208;tRNA/pyrrolysyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase pair. The designer enzyme was engineered to catalyze a dearomative [2+2] cycloaddition reaction in high yields (up to&gt;99&#8201;% yield) with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2 e.r.). This work provides a robust and facile method for photoenzyme design and lays the foundation for the development of further photoenzymatic reactions.

     alt="Genetic Incorporation of a Thioxanthone-Containing Amino Acid for the Design of Artificial Photoenzymes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The generic incorporation of a thioxanthone-containing amino acid into a protein scaffold is described. The resulting artificial photoenzyme was engineered to catalyze a dearomative [2+2] cycloaddition reaction in high yields with excellent enantioselectivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetically encodable photosensitizers allow the design of artificial photoenzymes to expand the scope of abiological reactions. Herein, we report the genetic incorporation of a thioxanthone-containing amino acid into a protein scaffold via an engineered pyrrolysyl-tRNA/pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase pair. The designer enzyme was engineered to catalyze a dearomative [2+2] cycloaddition reaction in high yields (up to&amp;gt;99&#8201;% yield) with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2 e.r.). This work provides a robust and facile method for photoenzyme design and lays the foundation for the development of further photoenzymatic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spherical Mg/Cu Co&#8208;Doped Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 Cathode Materials with Mitigated Diffusion&#8208;Induced Stresses and Enhanced Cyclic Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spherical Na4Fe2.96Mg0.02Cu0.02(PO4)2P2O7 (NFMCPP) cathode materials have been successfully synthesized via the combination of spray&#8208;drying and solid&#8208;state reaction method. The Mg/Cu co&#8208;doping can effectively mitigate the lattice volume change and promote the electronic conductivity of NFMCPP. While, the small NFMCPP particles with spherical geometry exhibit an enhanced structural stability, due to the high sphericity structure enables a low high&#8208;stress concentration and alleviated diffusion&#8208;induced stress during the extensive (de)sodiation cycling.







Abstract
Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFPP) has been regarded as the promising cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, the practical applications of NFPP are hindered by its high&#8208;volume changes, poor intrinsic electron conductivity and sluggish Na+ ions diffusion kinetics. Herein, a spray&#8208;drying and solid&#8208;state reaction method have been utilized to fabricate the spherical trace amount Mg/Cu co&#8208;doped Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFMCPP). The Mg/Cu co&#8208;doping can effectively mitigate the lattice volume change and promote the electronic conductivity of NFMCPP by reducing band gap between the conduction and valence bands. While, the unique spherical structured NFMCPP with a carbon film even coated on its surface ensures rapid electron transport. Moreover, small NFMCPP particles with spherical geometry demonstrate an alleviated diffusion&#8208;induced stress and enhanced structural stability, due to the high sphericity structure enables fluent Na+ extraction/insertion, leads to a low high&#8208;stress concentration and uniform stress/strain distribution during extensive (de)sodiation process. Consequently, the optimized spherical NFMCPP cathode materials exhibit an excellent rate capability and cyclic stability.

         <title>Fragment Discovery by X&#8208;Ray Crystallographic Screening Targeting the CTP Binding Site of Pseudomonas Aeruginosa IspD</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
During a crystallographic screening with IspD from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we identified a fragment residing inside the active site. We confirmed its interactions with the protein by 1H saturation transfer difference NMR spectroscopy. Initial fragment growing yielded derivatives with improved affinity towards IspD from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.







Abstract
With antimicrobial resistance (AMR) reaching alarming levels, new anti&#8208;infectives with unprecedented mechanisms of action are urgently needed. The 2&#8208;C&#8208;methylerythritol&#8208;D&#8208;erythritol&#8208;4&#8208;phosphate (MEP) pathway represents an attractive source of drug targets due to its essential role in numerous pathogenic Gram&#8208;negative bacteria and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mt), whilst being absent in human cells. Here, we solved the first crystal structure of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) IspD, the third enzyme in the MEP pathway and present the discovery of a fragment&#8208;based compound class identified through crystallographic screening of PaIspD. The initial fragment occupies the CTP binding cavity within the active site. Confirmation of fragment&#8211;protein interactions was achieved through 1H saturation&#8211;transfer difference nuclear magnetic resonance (1H&#8208;STD NMR spectroscopy). Building upon these findings and insights from the co&#8208;crystal structures, we identified two growth vectors for fragment growing. We synthesized derivatives addressing both growth vectors, which showed improved affinities for PaIspD. Our new fragment class targets PaIspD, displays promising affinity and favorable growth vectors for further optimization.

         <title>Supramolecular Assembly Enhanced Linear and Nonlinear Chiroptical Properties of Chiral Manganese Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular chiral self&#8208;assembly strategy has been demonstrated to effectively boost the linear and nonlinear chiroptical properties of hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic manganese halides. Ultimately, a near&#8208;unity green light emission is achieved. These chiral samples not only feature intense circularly polarized luminescence (glum~4.2&#215;10&#8722;2), but also showcase a strengthened capability to discriminate circularly polarized laser (gSHG&#8208;CD~1.8) that ranks among the highest reported values.







Abstract
Chiral hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic metal halides (HOMHs) hold great promise in broad applications ranging from ferroelectrics, spintronics to nonlinear optics, owing to their broken inversion symmetry and tunable chiroptoelectronic properties. Typically, chiral HOMHs are constructed by chiral organic cations and metal anion polyhedra, with the latter regarded as optoelectronic active units. However, the primary design approaches are largely constrained to regulation of general components within structural formula. Herein, supramolecular approaches have been taken for the functionalization of chiral enantiomers by anchoring chiral cations with crown ether hosting molecules. Chiral HOMHs of R&#8208;/S&#8208;(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6@ClMBA)2MnBr4 have been thus obtained with boosted linear and nonlinear chiroptical properties. The self&#8208;assembled cations lead to enhanced structural rigidity, which promote near&#8208;unity green light emission and strong circularly polarized luminescence with a high asymmetry factor, along with high efficiency second&#8208;order nonlinear optical responses. In particular, these chiral HOMH single crystals demonstrate a sensitive discrimination for circularly polarized laser in the near&#8208;infrared region with the nonlinear optical asymmetry factor (gSHG&#8208;CD) as high as 1.8. This work highlights the contribution of supramolecular assembly in improving chiroptical performances, offering valuable insights for the design of new chiral HOMH materials with promising application potentials as linear and nonlinear CPL emitters and detectors.

         <title>Flexible Fiber Sensors for Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Redox Signaling Molecules in Exercise&#8208;Mimicking Engineered Skeletal Muscle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work has reported the fabrication of dual flexible electrochemical sensors and achieved simultaneous monitoring of H2O2 and NO release from engineered skeletal muscle in response to exercise&#8208;mimicking stretch. The results proved that proper warm&#8208;up training could help improve exercise adaptation in skeletal muscle.







Abstract
Real&#8208;time monitoring of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) in skeletal muscle provides crucial insights into the cause&#8208;and&#8208;effect relationships between physical activity and health benefits. However, the dynamic production of exercise&#8208;induced RONS remains poorly explored, due to the lack of sensing tools that can conform to soft skeletal muscle while monitor RONS release during exercise. Here we introduce dual flexible sensors via twisting carbon nanotubes into helical bundles of fibers and subsequent assembling electrochemical sensing components. These flexible sensors exhibit low bending stiffness, excellent H2O2 and NO sensing abilities, outstanding biocompatibility and compliance with engineered skeletal muscle tissue. This allows real&#8208;time and simultaneous monitoring of H2O2 and NO release from engineered skeletal muscle in response to different exercise&#8208;mimicking stretches, which reveals that warm&#8208;up activities before high&#8208;intensity exercise may enhance adaptive responses by down&#8208;regulating H2O2 and up&#8208;regulating NO production. The proposed sensing strategy demonstrates great versatility in monitoring multiple biomarkers of soft tissue and organs.

         <title>Hour&#8208;Long Afterglow in Flexible Polymeric Materials through the Introduction of Electron Donor/Acceptor Exciplexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hour&#8208;long afterglow (HLA) polymers were fabricated through the introduction of electron donor/acceptor exciplexes. The polymers exhibited a remarkable green afterglow persisting for 12&#8197;hours under ambient conditions. The polymers are flexible and transparent, which are useful properties for flexible display applications. Moreover, the polymers were spun into fibers with the HLA property remaining, which holds promise for application in wearable smart devices.







Abstract
The development of organic afterglow materials has garnered significant attention due to their diverse applications in smart devices, optoelectronics, and bioimaging. However, polymeric afterglow materials often suffer from short emission lifetimes, typically ranging from milliseconds to seconds, posing a significant challenge for achieving hour&#8208;long afterglow (HLA) polymers. This study presents the successful fabrication of transparent HLA polymers by introducing electron donor/acceptor exciplexes. Employing aromatic polyesters as the polymer electron acceptor and charge reservoirs, the resulting HLA polymers exhibited a remarkable green afterglow that persisted for 12&#8197;hours under ambient conditions, representing the longest duration achieved for polymeric afterglow materials to date. Intriguingly, these HLA polymers could be activated solely by sunlight, maintaining a green afterglow for over 6&#8197;hours at room temperature in air, which outperformed all previously reported afterglow polymers. The doped polymers exhibited superior flexibility and transparency, making them ideal candidates for flexible display applications. Furthermore, successfully spinning these doped polymers into fibers while retaining their HLA properties opens up exciting possibilities for their use in wearable smart devices.

         <title>Support&#8208;Layer Integrated Zeolite Membranes through In Situ Interfacial Transformation of Clay&#8208;Based Protomembranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clay&#8208;based protomembranes transformed into support&#8208;layer integrated zeolite membranes by interfacial transformation without solvents. Inexpensive clay in protomembrane not only served as a raw material for the support but also provided active ingredients for the growth of zeolite crystals, which not only reduced the membrane preparation cost and environmental cost, but also improved the separation performance and stability of zeolite membranes.







Abstract
Zeolite membranes are considered ideal inorganic membrane materials for separating mixtures with molecular&#8208;level differences. However, their complex preparation process with excessive synthesis solutions for traditional hydrothermal heating methods leads to various drawbacks. Here, we describe a membrane preparation strategy involving an in situ interfacial transformation of the protomembrane without solvents. Inexpensive clay powder forms the protomembrane, and the active ingredients subsequently migrate from the interior of this protomembrane to its surface and transform into a zeolite layer. Ultimately, the protomembrane is calcined to obtain the support&#8208;layer integrated zeolite membrane. Systematic research shows that clay not only serves as a raw material for the support but also provides active ingredients for the growth of zeolite crystals; thus, zeolite membranes with zeolite particles inserted into the support are formed. The zeolite membrane calcined at 800&#8201;&#176;C possesses a p&#8208;xylene/o&#8208;xylene separation factor approaching 6263 with a permeation flux of 1.21&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201; m&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201; s&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201; Pa&#8722;1. This interfacial transformation method can be applied to other membranes and promote the development of membrane separation technology.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Electrolytes with High Disordered Solvation Structures for Ultra&#8208;Stable Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel low&#8208;concentration HE electrolyte is developed to address dendrite formation and side reactions in aqueous ZIBs. This HE electrolyte features weakly solvated structures and multiple anions, leading to highly disordered solvation shells that enhance zinc ion diffusion kinetics and electrode interface stability. As a result, Zn||Zn symmetric cells reach over 2,000&#8197;hours of cycling, and Zn||Cu cells achieve 99.9&#8201;% CE over 1,000 cycles.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are playing an increasingly important role in the field of energy storage owing to their low cost, high safety, and environmental friendliness. However, their practical applications are still handicapped by severe dendrite formation and side reactions (e.g., hydrogen evolution reaction and corrosion) on the zinc anodes. Herein, a low&#8208;concentration high&#8208;entropy (HE) electrolyte strategy is proposed to achieve high reversibility and ultra&#8208;durable zinc metal anode. Specifically, this HE electrolyte features multiple anions participating in coordination and highly disordered solvation shells, which would disrupt the intrinsic H&#8208;bond network between water molecules and suppress interfacial side reactions. Moreover, these diversified weakly solvated structures can lower the solvation energy of Zn2+ solvation configurations and enhance zinc ion diffusion kinetics, thereby promoting uniform Zn deposition and electrode interface stability. Consequently, Zn||Zn symmetric cells exhibit over 2,000&#8197;hours of cycling stability, and Zn||Cu asymmetric cells achieve a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.9&#8201;% over 500 cycles. Furthermore, the Zn||PANI full cell with the optimized HE&#8208;50&#8197;mM electrolyte delivers a high specific capacity of 110.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 2,000 cycles at 0.5&#8197;A g&#8722;1 and a capacity retention of 70.4&#8201;% at 15&#8197;A g&#8722;1 after 10,000 cycles. Remarkably, even at a low temperature of &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, the Zn||PANI full cells equipped with HE&#8208;50&#8197;mM electrolyte still demonstrate long&#8208;term cycling stability over 600 cycles with a high&#8208;capacity retention of 93.5&#8201;%. This research provides a promising strategy for the design of aqueous electrolytes, aiding in the development of low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;safety, and high&#8208;performance aqueous batteries.

         <title>Energy Transfer (EnT) Catalysis of Non&#8208;Symmetrical Borylated Dienes: Origin of Reaction Selectivity in Competing EnT Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energy transfer (EnT) has emerged as the gold standard for the excitation of unsaturated bonds. However, control over competing reaction pathways remains an intractable challenge. Here boron is used to probe the reactivity of non&#8208;symmetrical dienes under EnT, enabling a site&#8208; and regioselective [2+2] cycloaddition. Counterintuitive regiodivergence was observed when probing geometric isomerisation, leading to a mechanistic investigation to determine the origin of selectivity in competing EnT processes.







Abstract
Energy transfer catalysis (EnT) has had a profound impact on contemporary organic synthesis enabling the construction of higher in energy, complex molecules, via efficient access to the triplet excited state. Despite this, intermolecular reactivity, and the unique possibility to access several reaction pathways via a central triplet diradical has rendered control over reaction outcomes, an intractable challenge. Extended chromophores such as non&#8208;symmetrical dienes have the potential to undergo [2+2] cycloaddition, [4+2] cycloaddition or geometric isomerisation, which, in combination with other mechanistic considerations (site&#8208; and regioselectivity), results in chemical reactions that are challenging to regulate. Herein, we utilise boron as a tool to probe reactivity of non&#8208;symmetrical dienes under EnT catalysis, paying particular attention to the impact of boron hybridisation effects on the target reactivity. Through this, a highly site&#8208; and regioselective [2+2] cycloaddition was realised with the employed boron motif effecting reaction efficiency. Subtle modifications to the core scaffold enabled a [4+2] cycloaddition, while a counterintuitive regiodivergence was observed in geometric isomerisation versus [2+2] cycloaddition. The observed reactivity was validated via a mechanistic investigation, determining the origin of regiodivergence and reaction selectivity in competing EnT processes.

         <title>Mass Transfer&#8208;Enhanced Photothermal Membranes with Synergistic Light Utilization for High&#8208;Turbidity Wastewater Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A suspended photothermal Fenton membrane is specifically designed to address the challenges of light attenuation and impurity interference in treating high&#8208;turbidity and colored wastewater. Impressive light utilization and mass transfer allow for continuous operation in a flow reactor for up to 10&#8197;days without any significant decline in actual industrial wastewater.







Abstract
The photo&#8208;Fenton process faces significant limitations in treating high&#8208;turbidity, colored wastewater due to light attenuation and impurity interference (blocked mass transfer). To address these issues, we developed a suspended photothermal Fenton membrane by loading a photothermal catalyst on a hydrophobically modified cotton filter paper, enabling precise suspension 1&#8197;mm below the water surface. This design achieved 89.49&#8201;% light utilization and high chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal, even in wastewater with extreme chromaticity (10 multiples) and turbidity (703 NTU). The enhanced photothermal conversion accelerated molybdenum co&#8208;catalyzed Fenton reactions and improved peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation, maintaining over 90&#8201;% phenol removal for 15&#8197;days. Mechanistic simulations revealed improved mass transfer of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pollutants at the solid&#8211;liquid interface, with PMS diffusion identified as the rate&#8208;limiting step. The membrane resisted fouling from suspended solids and maintained stable operation in soil&#8208;containing solutions for 10&#8197;days. This innovative approach offers an efficient solution for degrading pollutants in dark&#8208;colored, high&#8208;turbidity wastewater, overcoming traditional process limitations.

     alt="Mass Transfer-Enhanced Photothermal Membranes with Synergistic Light Utilization for High-Turbidity Wastewater Purification"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A suspended photothermal Fenton membrane is specifically designed to address the challenges of light attenuation and impurity interference in treating high-turbidity and colored wastewater. Impressive light utilization and mass transfer allow for continuous operation in a flow reactor for up to 10&#8197;days without any significant decline in actual industrial wastewater.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photo-Fenton process faces significant limitations in treating high-turbidity, colored wastewater due to light attenuation and impurity interference (blocked mass transfer). To address these issues, we developed a suspended photothermal Fenton membrane by loading a photothermal catalyst on a hydrophobically modified cotton filter paper, enabling precise suspension 1&#8197;mm below the water surface. This design achieved 89.49&#8201;% light utilization and high chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal, even in wastewater with extreme chromaticity (10 multiples) and turbidity (703 NTU). The enhanced photothermal conversion accelerated molybdenum co-catalyzed Fenton reactions and improved peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation, maintaining over 90&#8201;% phenol removal for 15&#8197;days. Mechanistic simulations revealed improved mass transfer of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pollutants at the solid&#8211;liquid interface, with PMS diffusion identified as the rate-limiting step. The membrane resisted fouling from suspended solids and maintained stable operation in soil-containing solutions for 10&#8197;days. This innovative approach offers an efficient solution for degrading pollutants in dark-colored, high-turbidity wastewater, overcoming traditional process limitations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Hydrolysis of Nitriles to Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reductive hydrolysis of inexpensive and easily accessible nitriles using Ni&#8208;tripos complex allows for the synthesis of functionalized and structurally diverse benzylic, heterocyclic, and aliphatic primary alcohols including the late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive molecules.







Abstract
Nitriles are an abundant class of compounds that are widely used as versatile feedstocks to produce various chemicals including pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals as well as materials. Here we report Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive hydrolysis of nitriles to alcohols in the presence of molecular hydrogen. This conversion likely occurs in a domino reaction sequence that first involves the hydrogenation of nitrile to primary imine, then the hydrolysis of imine, and subsequent deamination to the aldehyde, which is finally hydrogenated to the desired alcohol. Crucial for this reductive hydrolysis process is the commercially available triphos&#8208;ligated Ni&#8208;complex that enables highly efficient and selective transformation of aromatic, heterocyclic, and aliphatic nitriles including fatty nitriles to prepare functionalized primary alcohols. Further, the synthetic applicability of this Ni&#8208;based protocol is presented for the selective conversion of nitrile to alcoholic group in structurally diverse and complex drug molecules as well as agrochemicals. The resulting products, alcohols are indispensable chemicals commonly used in organic synthesis and life sciences as well as material and energy technologies.

         <title>Promoting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution by Stabilization of Excited Triplet States and Enhancement of Internal Electric Field at Dye/PCN Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work affords an efficient approach to promote PHE by both strengthening the driving force at dye/PCN interface and stabilizing excited triplet states of organic dyes by rational modulation of molecular structures and aggregated behaviors. The IEF strength increased by the adjustable substitution positions of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A moieties from p&#8208; to o&#8208;substitution, and the lifetimes of excited triplet states were prolonged by the alkyl chain engineering.







Abstract
The heterojunction photocatalysts composed of organic dyes and polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) have great potential for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE). However, serious charge recombination exists at the dye/PCN interface for the large gaps in time scales and the poor driving force of charge transfer process. Herein, both the excited triplet states of organic dyes with long lifetimes and strong internal electric fields (IEF) as charge transfer driving forces are achieved by the construction of high dipole moments with aromatic&#8208;core engineering, and modulation of dye aggregates by alkyl modification. Accordingly, PHE efficiency can achieve up to 833.49&#8197;&#956;mol/h, over 36&#8208;fold that of PCN/Pt (23.34&#8197;&#956;mol/h) under the same conditions. The relationship between molecular structures and PHE performance has been systematically investigated by the photophysical properties of organic dyes and the strength of IEF at dye/PCN interface. It afforded an efficient strategy to balance the charge transfer process in PHE systems, which can guide the molecular design of organic dyes with optimized aggregated behaviors and stable excited triplet states.

         <title>Linker Installation in a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Enhanced Quantitative Redox Species Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) demonstrate remarkable versatility, enabling tailored properties and functions through targeted design and modification. Linker installation provides an efficient approach to achieve specific alterations. Notably, a series of redox&#8208;active dyes were successfully integrated into the Zr&#8208;MOF PCN&#8208;700, enabling enhanced&#8208;type quantitative recognition of diverse reductants and oxidants.







Abstract
Linker installation has proven to be an effective strategy for introducing diverse functional groups into metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Reductants and oxidants are found in various environments, but their accumulation poses a danger due to their high reactivity, necessitating prompt monitoring instantly, particularly in natural environments and industrial processes. In this study, a series of redox&#8208;active dyes were successfully incorporated into a flexible Zr&#8208;based MOF, PCN&#8208;700, through linker installation strategy. Notably, both the reduction of PCN&#8208;700&#8208;Resazurin towards oxidants and oxidation of PCN&#8208;700&#8208;Amplex Red towards reductants result in the formation of PCN&#8208;700&#8208;Resorufin, which exhibit visible color changes and largely elevated luminescent intensities, giving rise to the quantitative recognition of reductants and oxidants. This work presents a straightforward approach to developing efficient luminescent sensors for the rapid qualitative and quantitative detection of reductants and oxidants, extending the sensing mechanism from common energy transfer to electron transfer and demonstrating the MOF's versability as a highly designable sensing material for target analytes.

         <title>Dynamic Passivation of Perovskite Films via Gradual Additive Release for Enhanced Solar Cell Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this, we propose a dynamic passivation strategy that employs a pre&#8208;passivator, formamidinesulfinic acid (FSA), to synchronize the release of additives with the generation of defect sites, thereby enabling in situ and real&#8208;time defect passivation. A champion perovskite solar cell achieves an impressive solar conversion efficiency of 25.33&#8201;%, accompanied with an exceptional stability.







Abstract
Modifying perovskites with functional additives has proven effective in refining the crystallization process and passivating the defects of perovskite films, thereby ensuring high photovoltaic efficiencies. However, conventional methods that involve pre&#8208;mixing additives into the precursor solution often face challenges due to discrepancies in the spatial distribution of slow&#8208;diffused additives relative to dynamically formed defect sites, resulting in limited passivation effectiveness. To address this issue, this study innovatively proposes a dynamic passivation strategy that utilizes a pre&#8208;passivator to gradually release active additives during the thermal crystallization process of perovskite films. By leveraging the principle of energy minimization, these timely&#8208;released additives can interact precisely and selectively with the high&#8208;energy defect sites generated during crystallization, thus facilitating efficient additive utilization and in situ real&#8208;time defect passivation. Through analysis of crystallization kinetics and carrier dynamic, it is demonstrated that this dynamic passivation approach significantly improves film quality and prolongs carrier lifetime, outperforming traditional pre&#8208;mixing tactics. Consequently, the final perovskite solar cell achieves an impressive solar conversion efficiency of 25.33&#8201;%, along with exceptional stability. This work provides strong support of tailored additive strategies aimed at further enhancing the efficiency of perovskite solar cells and their subsequent commercial applications.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Skeletal Editing through a Formal Nitrogen Insertion into Indoles to Synthesize Atropisomeric Aminoaryl Quinoxalines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper(I) and chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) relay catalyzed enantioselective skeletal editing of indoles with 1,2&#8208;aminoarenes to quinoxaline ring has been developed to prepare various axially chiral aminoaryl quinoxalines in good yields and excellent enantioselectivity. Moreover, axially chiral aminoaryl quinoxalines could be converted into various axially chiral building blocks and aminoaryl quinoxaline derived ligand is demonstrated to be applicable to asymmetric catalysis.







Abstract
Skeletal editing represents an attractive strategy for adding complexity to a given molecular scaffold in chemical synthesis. Isodesmic reactions provide a complementary skeletal editing approach for the redistribution of chemical bonds in chemical synthesis. However, catalytic enantioselective isodesmic reaction is extremely scarce and enantioselective isodesmic reaction to synthesize atropisomeric compounds is unknown. Herein, we report a facile method to synthesize axially chiral aminoaryl quinoxalines through Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed dearomatization and sequential chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyzed enantioselective isodesmic C&#8722;N bond formation and cleavage from indoles and 1,2&#8208;diaminoarenes under mild reaction conditions. In this process, the five&#8208;membered ring of the indole scaffold was broken and a novel quinoxaline skeleton was constructed. This method allows the practical and atom&#8208;economical synthesis of valuable axially chiral aminoaryl quinoxalines in high yields (up to 95&#8201;%) and generally excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee). Notably, this novel type of quinoxaline atropisomers has promising applications in developing axially chiral ligand in asymmetric catalysis. This strategy represents the first example of CPA&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective isodesmic reaction to form axially chiral compounds.

Moreover, axially chiral aminoaryl quinoxalines could be converted into various axially chiral building blocks and aminoaryl quinoxaline derived ligand is demonstrated to be applicable to asymmetric catalysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skeletal editing represents an attractive strategy for adding complexity to a given molecular scaffold in chemical synthesis. Isodesmic reactions provide a complementary skeletal editing approach for the redistribution of chemical bonds in chemical synthesis. However, catalytic enantioselective isodesmic reaction is extremely scarce and enantioselective isodesmic reaction to synthesize atropisomeric compounds is unknown. Herein, we report a facile method to synthesize axially chiral aminoaryl quinoxalines through Cu(I)-catalyzed dearomatization and sequential chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyzed enantioselective isodesmic C&#8722;N bond formation and cleavage from indoles and 1,2-diaminoarenes under mild reaction conditions. In this process, the five-membered ring of the indole scaffold was broken and a novel quinoxaline skeleton was constructed. This method allows the practical and atom-economical synthesis of valuable axially chiral aminoaryl quinoxalines in high yields (up to 95&#8201;%) and generally excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee). Notably, this novel type of quinoxaline atropisomers has promising applications in developing axially chiral ligand in asymmetric catalysis. This strategy represents the first example of CPA-catalyzed enantioselective isodesmic reaction to form axially chiral compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Toward Rhenium&#8208;Based Circularly Polarized OLEDs Using Tailored Chiral Re(CO)3 Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral Re(I) emitters exhibiting strong circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) with enhanced dissymmetry factors and PLQYs are tailored and exploited to develop the the first examples of rhenium&#8208;based CP&#8208;OLEDs. The latter exhibit gEL factors of up to 6.2&#215;10&#8722;3 along with a good device performance. This work highlights potential of chiral Re(I) emitters for CP&#8208;OLED applications, and provides a new shortcut to CPP&#8208;active emitters.







Abstract
Chiral rhenium(I) emitters exhibiting circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) are an attractive mainstay for CP organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs). However, the efficiency of such emitters is not ideal, and they have never been explored for circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) applications. Here, we have tailored robust chiral Re(I) complexes with improved CPP properties, and demonstrated CPEL from rhenium emitters for the first time. Two pairs of enantiomeric Re(I) complexes have been synthesized by introducing of one or two chiral menthol groups into 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline unit (phen) of archetypical emitters [ReBr(CO)3(phen)]. The designed complexes exhibit a yellow CPP with enhanced |glum| factors (up to 2.5&#215;10&#8722;2) and a good quantum efficiency. The pioneering Re(I)&#8208;based CP&#8208;OLEDs (based on the obtained emitters) exhibit yellow CPEL with |gEL| factors of up to 6.2&#215;10&#8722;3 and a maximal external quantum efficiency of 13.2&#8201;%. This work highlights the good potential of chiral Re(I) emitters for CPEL applications, and opens up a new shortcut to CPP&#8208;active Re(I) complexes.

         <title>A Chiral COFs Membrane for Enantioselective Amino Acid Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct synthesis approach was employed to fabricate a homochiral covalent organic framework (COF) utilizing a well&#8208;defined chiral amine precursor. The resulting membrane exhibited exceptional enantioselectivity for racemic phenylalanine due to the uniform distribution of chiral recognition sites and a high degree of size matching between the chiral centers and the target molecule. This resulted in an enantiomeric excess value reaching 99.4&#8201;%.







Abstract
Incorporating chiral molecules in the covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with uniformly ordered pores results in chiral COFs, which have been highly promising candidates for enantioseparation. Herein, a homochiral COF nanochannel membrane is reported by introducing chiral centers (L&#8208;phenylalanine methyl ester) into one of the organic ligands for the enantioseparation of chiral amino acids. The separation results show that the D&#8208;isomer is preferentially transported through the porous membrane channel. This composite membrane exhibits excellent selectivity for racemic phenylalanine with the highest enantiomeric excess value of up to 99.4&#8201;%. The adsorption and molecular modeling studies substantiate the experiment results by showing higher bonding affinity towards D&#8208;isomer over L&#8208;isomer. The excellent enantioselective gating performance unveils the porous COF skeleton with chiral selectors and the size&#8208;matching synergy for stereoselective interactions with chiral isomers.

Site&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of oxime ethers by controlling the orientation of a directing group using electron&#8208;deficient Cp*CF3Ir(III) and a photosensitizer is reported. Switchable and successive C(sp3)&#8722;H/C(sp2)&#8722;H and C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H double functionalization was accomplished by manipulating the order of C&#8722;H activation to construct densely functionalized structures.







Abstract
A site&#8208;selective functionalization of a C(sp3)&#8722;H bond was achieved in the presence of an intrinsically more reactive C(sp2)&#8722;H bond by controlling the orientation of a directing group via a photo&#8208;induced E/Z isomerization of an oxime ether. By combining E/Z isomerization and an electron deficient Cp*CF3Ir(III) catalyst, the scope of oxime ethers in C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization was successfully expanded. Based on this strategy, the order of C&#8722;H activation was switchable and successive C(sp3)&#8722;H/C(sp2)&#8722;H and C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H double functionalizations were accomplished to construct densely functionalized structures.

         <title>Diastereoselective Polypseudorotaxane Formation with Planar Chiral Pillar[5]arenes via Co&#8208;crystallization Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diastereoselective polypseudorotaxane formation was achieved through the simple co&#8208;crystallization of a diastereomeric pillar[5]arene macrocycle and poly(ethylene glycol). During the co&#8208;crystallization process, the concentration gradually increased, allowing the pillar[5]arene and poly(ethylene glycol) to assemble closely. Consequently, the matched packing of the pillar[5]arene side chains facilitated the cooperative arrangement of pillar[5]arenes with the same chirality along the polymer chain.







Abstract
As the number of chiral ring molecules in chiral polyrotaxane increases, the number of possible stereoisomers exponentially increases. Consequently, the selective synthesis of a specific stereoisomer becomes much more challenging. To address this problem, we co&#8208;crystallized poly(ethylene glycol) and a diastereomeric ring molecule, pillar[5]arene, in the solid state. The co&#8208;crystallization formed polypseudorotaxanes with a high diastereomeric excess (ca. 88&#8201;% de), meaning that polypseudorotaxanes containing (S, pS) stereoisomer pillar[5]arene rings were synthesized selectively. By contrast, in solution and evaporation systems, the selectivity remained low (ca. 10&#8201;% de). The results suggested that the packing effect by the co&#8208;crystallization contributed to the denser assembly of ring molecules on the polymeric chain, resulting in the diastereoselective formation. High diastereoselectivity was also observed even in higher&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight poly(ethylene glycol)s. These selectivities arose from the cooperative effects of the ring molecules on the polymeric chain, which were supported by calculating the stabilization energy.

         <title>Insight into Robust Anion Coordination Behavior of Organic Cathode with Dual Elongated &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Motifs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual elongation strategy of &#960;&#8208;conjugated motifs with active sites is proposed, containing both the extended carbazole and electropolymerized polymer, which enhances electronic conductivity by the electronic delocalization of electron&#8208;withdrawing conjugated groups, boosts theoretical capacity by increasing redox&#8208;active site density, and endows robust electrochemical stability attributed to nanonetwork organic structures.







Abstract
Organic electrode materials offer multi&#8208;electron reactivity, flexible structures, and redox reversibility, but encounter poor conductivity and durability in electrolytes. To overcome above barriers, we propose a dual elongation strategy of &#960;&#8208;conjugated motifs with active sites, involving the extended carbazole and electropolymerized polymer, which enhances electronic conductivity by the electronic delocalization of electron&#8208;withdrawing conjugated groups, boosts theoretical capacity by increasing redox&#8208;active site density, and endows robust electrochemical stability attributed to the nanonetwork feature of polymer structures. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, 5,11&#8208;dihydridoindolo[3,2&#8208;b]carbazole (DHIC) is selected as the model cathode material for a dual&#8208;ion battery, with elongated carbazole groups functioning both as redox&#8208;active centers and polymerization anchors. Electrochemical comparisons and theoretical simulations validate the excellent specific capacity, accelerated reaction kinetics, and enhanced anion storage stability imparted by the dual elongated &#960;&#8208;conjugated system containing both carbazole motif and electropolymerized DHIC (pDHIC). Simultaneously, the coordination interaction between pDHIC and anions is innovatively evidenced through operando electron paramagnetic resonance spectra. As anticipated, pDHIC cathode delivers an unprecedentedly high specific capacity of 197&#8197;mAh/g at 50&#8197;mA/g, far outperforming graphite cathodes, and maintains excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 86.1&#8201;% over 500&#8197;cycles. This synergetic strategy sheds light on the performance revolution of organic electrode materials.

         <title>Photocatalytic Dehalogenation of Aryl Halides Mediated by the Flexible Metal&#8211;Organic Framework MIL&#8208;53(Cr)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic potential of flexible metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) remains underexplored, particularly in solution&#8208;phase reactions. This study employs MIL&#8208;53(Cr), a prototypical "breathing" MOF capable of structural adaptation via pore size modulation, as a photocatalyst for the dehalogenation of aryl halides. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and pair distribution function analyses reveal that organic solvents influence pore opening, while substrates and products dynamically adjust the framework configuration during catalysis. This structural flexibility enables precise tuning of photocatalytic efficiency via solvent&#8208;mediated control of the pore aperture. The results demonstrate that the dynamic behavior of MIL&#8208;53(Cr) facilitates enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity, advancing the application of flexible MOFs as tunable, enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalysts. These findings pave the way for the rational design of next&#8208;generation flexible photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Energy/Electron Transfer within Single&#8208;Chain Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate that single&#8208;chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) &#8211; compact covalently folded single polymer chains &#8211; can increase photocatalytic performance of an embedded catalytic center, compared to the comparable catalytic system in free solution. In particular, we demonstrate that the degree of compaction allows to finely tailor the catalytic activity, thus evidencing that molecular confinement is a key factor in controlling photocatalysis. Specifically, we decorate a linear parent polymer with both photoreactive chalcone moieties as well as Ru(bpy)3 catalytic centers. We initially construct a SCNP via a photosensitized [2+2] cycloaddition at 510&#160;nm and demonstrate that the SCNP formation is substantially more efficient when the Ru(bpy)3 units are part of the polymer chain instead of as free molecules in solution. Subsequently, we employ the same Ru(bpy)3 units as photocatalysts in a model reaction employing pyrene units as charge transfer moieties. We establish that the photocatalytic activity increases as the polymer becomes more compact, reaching peak efficiency, followed by a subsequent decline as the SCNP becomes too compact. Thus, we identify a goldilocks regime of catalyst confinement via SCNP compaction for use in photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multifunctional ortho&#8208;quinones are required for the formation of thiol&#8208;catechol&#8208;connectivities (TCC) but can be delicate to handle. We present the electrochemical oxidation of the dipeptide DiDOPA, achieving up to 92% conversion efficiency of the catechols to ortho&#8208;quinones. Graphite and stainless steel could be employed as cost&#8208;efficient electrodes. The electrochemical activation yields quinone&#8208;solutions, which are free of undesired reactive compounds and eliminates the challenging step of isolating the reactive quinones. The DiDOPA quinones were employed in polyaddition reactions with multi&#8208;thiols, forming oligomers that functioned as transient enzyme stabilizers (TES). These TCC&#8208;TES&#8208;additives improved the thermal stability and the activity of tyrosinase in heat stress assays.</dc:description>

         <title>MOF&#8208;based Dual&#8208;Layer Pickering Emulsion: Molecular&#8208;Level Gating of Water Delivery at Water&#8208;Oil Interface for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogenation Using H2O as a Hydrogen Source</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biphasic system not only presents a promising opportunity for complex catalytic processes, but also is a grand challenge in efficient tandem reactions. As an emerging solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion, the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven and water&#8208;donating hydrogenation combines the sustainability of photocatalysis and economic&#8208;value of hydrogenation. However, the key and challenging point is to couple water&#8208;soluble photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with oil&#8208;soluble hydrogenation. Herein, we employed metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and CdS nanorods to construct a MOF&#8208;CdS dual&#8208;layer Pickering emulsion (water in oil, W/O), which compartmented aqueous phase for photocatalytic HER and oil phase for hydrogenation. The hydrophobic MOF and hydrophilic CdS were isolated at the inner and outer layers of W/O emulsion, respectively. The molecularly regulated hydrophobicity of MOF controlled the water delivery onto CdS photocatalysts, which realized the synergistic regulation of HER and hydrogenation. In the photocatalytic hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde, the highest yield of MOF&#8208;CdS Pickering emulsion reached 187.37 mmol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1, 30 times that of the counterpart without emulsion (6.44 mmol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1). Its apparent quantum yield reached 43.24% without co&#8208;catalysts. To our knowledge, this performance is at a top&#8208;level so far. Our work realized the precise regulation of water&#8208;oil interface to effectively couple two reactions in different phases, providing new perspective for challenging tandem catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Topological Insulator Heterojunction with Electric Dipole Domain to Boost Polysulfide Conversion in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The heterojunction materials are considered as promising electrocatalyst candidates that empower advanced lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. However, the detailed functional mechanism of heterojunction materials to boost the sulfur redox reaction kinetics remains unclear. Herein, we construct a multifunctional potential well&#8208;type Bi2Te3/TiO2 topological insulator (TI) heterojunction with electric dipole domain to elucidate the synergistic mechanism, which facilitates rapid mass transport, strengthens polysulfide capture ability and accelerates polysulfide conversion. Therefore, the Li&#8208;S battery with Bi2Te3/TiO2 TI heterojunction modified separator achieves high utilization of sulfur cathode, delivering a high reversible specific capacity of 1375 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.2 C and long cycling capability with a negligible capacity decay of 0.022% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1 C. Even with the high sulfur loading of 13.2 mg cm&#8208;2 and low E/S ratio of 3.8 &#181;L mg&#8208;1, a high area capacity of 11.2 mAh cm&#8208;2 and acceptable cycling stability can be obtained. This work provides guidance for designing high&#8208;efficiency TI heterojunctions to promote the practical application of Li&#8208;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymers for High&#8208;Performance Organic Electrochemical Transistors: Molecular Design Strategies, Applications and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The last decade has witnessed significant progress in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) due to their enormous potential applications in various bioelectronic devices, such as artificial synapses, biological interfaces, and biosensors. The remarkable advance achieved in this filed is highly powered by the development of novel organic mixed ionic/electronic conductors (OMIECs). Among these, &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (CPs), which are widely used in various optoelectronics, are emerging as key channel materials for OECTs. In this review, after briefly introducing of OECT, we then mainly focus on the latest progress in CPs for high&#8208;performance OECTs. The correlations of their structure, basic physicochemical properties, and device performance are further elucidated via evaluating their electronic characters, optoelectronic properties, and OECT performance. Then, the applications of CP&#8208;based OECTs are briefly presented. Finally, we discuss several remaining issues or challenges in this field and give our insight into advancing CPs for enhanced OECT performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Defluorinative C&#8210;O Coupling between Trifluoromethylarenes and Alcohols via Copper Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorine&#8208;containing compounds have shown unparalleled impacts in the realm of functional molecules, and the ability to prepare novel structures has been crucial in unlocking new properties for applications in pharmaceutical and materials science. Herein, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed, photoinduced defluorinative C&#8210;O coupling between trifluoromethylarenes and alcohols. This method allows for direct access to a wide selection of difluorobenzylether (ArCF2OR) molecules, including a compound displaying liquid crystal behavior. Through slight modification of the protocol, we were able to generate ArCF2I products, another class of synthetically useful fluorine&#8208;bearing molecules. Mechanistic investigations first suggested that ArCF2I can serve as a reservoir to steadily supply the key ArCF2&#8226; radical species. Furthermore, experimental evidence supported a mechanism consisting of two collaborative cycles: C&#8210;F activation operated by a homoleptic Cu(I) coordinated by two bisphosphine ligands as the photocatalyst and C&#8210;O coupling promoted by a Cu(I) ligated by a single bisphosphine ligand. The critical roles of the two salt additives, lithium iodide and zinc acetate, in orchestrating the two cycles were also elucidated. This dual&#8208;role copper catalyst demonstrates the power of base metal photoredox catalysis in achieving both substrate activation and chemical bond formation via a single catalytic system.</dc:description>

         <title>2,3:6,7&#8210;Naphthalenediimide&#8208;based Chiral Triangular Macrocycle: Self&#8208;Assembled Helix, Outer &#960;&#8208;surface Directed Co&#8208;assembly and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we report the synthesis and self&#8208;assembly of a novel chiral 2,3:6,7&#8210;naphthalenediimide&#8208;based triangular macrocycle (NDI&#8208;&#8710;) and their chiroptical properties. The enantiomeric NDI&#8208;&#8710; is synthesized by condensation of (RR) or (SS)&#8208;trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine and 2,3,6,7&#8208;naphthalenetetracarboxylic 2,3:6,7&#8208;dianhydride, in which the chirality of the macrocycles is controlled by the diamine. With the rigid outer &#960;&#8208;surface, the macrocycle showed unique chiroptical properties and self&#8208;assembly modes. The NDI&#8208;&#8710; showed circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in solution and can self&#8208;assemble into helical structures with the inversion of CPL signal and the enhancement of |glum|. Moreover, the NDI&#8208;&#8710; has a tailored electron&#8208;deficient outer &#960;&#8208;surface, which can co&#8208;assemble with an electron&#8208;rich anthracene (AN) to form an intermolecular charge transfer (CT) complex, generating a yellow&#8208;green CT&#8208;CPL. Crystal structure analysis confirms that AN is mounted on the outer surface of NDI&#8208;&#8710; through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions. This work provides a critical example for self&#8208;assembly of macrocycles into helical structures and outer &#960;&#8208;surface directed CT complexes formation, opening up a new clue for designing chiral macrocycle&#8208;based chiroptical materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Topology&#8208;Controlled BODIPY and CO2&#8208;Based Zirconium Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY)&#8208;based zirconium metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Zr&#8208;MOFs) possess strong light&#8208;harvesting capabilities and great potential for artificial photosynthesis without the use of sacrificial reagents. However, their direct preparation has not yet been achieved due to challenges in synthesizing suitable ligands. Herein, we reported the first successful direct synthesis of BODIPY&#8208;based Zr&#8208;MOFs, utilizing CO&#8322; as a feedstock. By controlling synthetic conditions, we successfully obtained two distinct Zr&#8208;MOFs. The first, CO2&#8208;Zr6&#8208;DEPB, exhibits a face&#8208;centered cubic (fcu) topology based on a Zr6(&#956;3&#8208;O)4(&#956;3&#8208;OH)4 node, while the second, CO2&#8208;Zr12&#8208;DEPB, features a hexagonal closed packed (hcp) topology, structured around a Zr12(&#956;3&#8208;O)8(&#956;3&#8208;OH)8(&#956;2&#8208;OH)6 node. Both MOFs demonstrated excellent crystallinity, as verified through powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy analyses. These MOF catalysts displayed suitable photocatalytic redox potentials for the reduction of CO2 to CO using H2O as the electron donor in the absence of co&#8208;catalyst or toxic sacrificial reagent. Under light irradiation, CO2&#8208;Zr12&#8208;DEPB and CO2&#8208;Zr6&#8208;DEPB offered high CO yields of 16.72 and 13.91 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1, respectively, with nearly 100% selectivity. CO2 uptake and photoelectrochemical experiments revealed key insights into the mechanisms driving the different catalytic activities of the two MOFs. These BODIPY and CO2&#8208;based, light&#8208;responsive Zr&#8208;MOFs represent a promising platform for the development of efficient photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Bionic Hollow Porous Carbon Nanofibers for Energy&#8208;Dense and Rapid Zinc Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Suboptimal spatial utilization and inefficient access to internal porosity preclude porous carbon cathodes from delivering high energy density in zinc&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors (ZIHCs). Inspired by the function of capillaries in biological systems, this study proposes a facile coordination&#8208;pyrolysis method to fabricate thin&#8208;walled hollow carbon nanofibers (CNFs) with optimized pore structure and surface functional groups for ZHICs. The capillary&#8208;like CNFs maximize the electrode/electrolyte interface area, facilitating the optimal utilization of energy storage sites. The precision&#8208;engineered pore sizes in the fiber walls are specifically tailored to accommodate solvated [Zn(H2O)6]2+, thus enhancing ion storage capacity and supporting accelerated transport kinetics. The resultant ZIHCs achieve a battery&#8208;grade energy density of 132.8 Wh kg&#8208;1 (based on active material), remarkable stability (98.7% retention after 80,000 cycles at 10 A g&#8208;1), along with practically high areal capacities. Combined in situ/ex situ spectroscopic characterizations, kinetic analyses, and theoretical calculations revealed that the superior energy storage performance arises from the advantageous microstructure of the biomimetic CNFs and the reversible physical/chemical adsorption process. This investigation offers a novel strategy for designing high&#8208;efficiency zinc ion storage carbon nanomaterials and provides insights into the cathodic storage mechanisms essential for advancing ZIHCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid CIGS&#8208;Cobalt Quaterpyridine Photocathode with Backside Illumination: a New Paradigm for Solar Fuel Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chalcogenide&#8208;based thin&#8208;film solar cell optimized for rear illumination and used for CO2 reduction is presented. Central to this innovation is a thinner, Cu(In,Ga)S2 chalcopyrite absorber coated with a robust metallic top layer, which potentially surpasses the performance of conventional front&#8208;illuminated designs. Using cobalt quaterpyridine molecular catalyst, photocurrent densities for CO2 reduction exceeding 10 mA/cm2 at 0.0 V vs. RHE under 1 Sun illumination, and ca. 16 mA/cm2 at &#8208;0.25 V vs. RHE were achieved in voltammetry experiments. Controlled potential electrolysis showed catalytic activity over 20 h with selectivity for CO ranging from &gt; 92% (first 4 hours) to 86% at the end of the experiment. This approach opens limitless possibilities for employing various reduction catalysts, extending far beyond CO2 reduction.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chalcogenide-based thin-film solar cell optimized for rear illumination and used for CO2 reduction is presented. Central to this innovation is a thinner, Cu(In,Ga)S2 chalcopyrite absorber coated with a robust metallic top layer, which potentially surpasses the performance of conventional front-illuminated designs. Using cobalt quaterpyridine molecular catalyst, photocurrent densities for CO2 reduction exceeding 10 mA/cm2 at 0.0 V vs. RHE under 1 Sun illumination, and ca. 16 mA/cm2 at -0.25 V vs. RHE were achieved in voltammetry experiments. Controlled potential electrolysis showed catalytic activity over 20 h with selectivity for CO ranging from &amp;gt; 92% (first 4 hours) to 86% at the end of the experiment. This approach opens limitless possibilities for employing various reduction catalysts, extending far beyond CO2 reduction. It imposes minimal constraints on absorption properties, immobilization methods, and catalyst nature, setting the stage for high-performance, adaptable PEC devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>B12&#8208;Dependent Radical SAM Enzymes Catalyze C&#8208;Fluoromethylation via a CH2F&#8208;cobalamin Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorine and fluorine&#8208;containing functional groups play important roles in drugs and agrochemicals. Recently, SAM&#8208;dependent methyltransferases and several SAM analogues have been reported for fluoromethyl transfer through a nucleophilic mechanism. However, fluoromethylation of unactivated carbon centers is very challenging, and their substitution usually involves a radical mechanism. To date, no biocatalysts have been developed for fluoromethylation of unactivated carbon centers. In this study, we found that the B12&#8208;dependent radical SAM methyltransferase (B12&#8208;RSMT) QCMT can fluoromethylate the glutamine C&#945; position of peptides with fluorinated SAM (F&#8208;SAM) generated in situ by the enzyme AclHMT. QCMT can cleave F&#8208;SAM to produce the 5&#180;&#8208;dA radical. The significant reaction intermediate CH2FCbI was characterized by HR&#8208;MS, 19F&#8208;NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography. In addition, B12&#8208;RSMTs CysS and GenD1 can also transfer fluoromethyl groups onto natural products. We also found that F&#8208;SAM is not compulsory. The reduced B12&#8208;RSMTs can directly generate CH2FCbI with CH2FI and transfer the CH2F group when SAM is used as the radical initiator. Our results demonstrate a radical&#8208;mediated enzymatic strategy for fluoromethylation with abiological cofactors and expand radical SAM enzymes to the field of fluorine chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;throughput Design of Single&#8208;atom Catalysts with Nonplanar and Triple Pyrrole&#8208;N Coordination for Highly Efficient H2O2 Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with nonplanar configurations possess unique capabilities for tailoring the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic performance compared with the ones with planar configurations, owing to the additional orbital rearrangement arising from the asymmetric coordination atoms. However, the systematic investigation of these nonplanar SACs has long been hindered by the difficulty in screening feasible nonplanar configurations and precisely controlling the coordination structures. Herein, we demonstrate a combined high&#8208;throughput screening and experimental verification of nonplanar SACs (ppy&#8208;MN3) for highly active and selective 2e&#8722; ORR electrocatalysis. With the additional p&#8208;orbital rearrangement of N&#8208;ligands for ppy&#8208;MN3 during catalysis, a new descriptor &#65288;&#916;&#1297;d&#8208;p&#65289;&#160;is proposed to accurately identify the relationship between their catalytic activities and electronic structures, on top of the conventional d&#8208;band center theory. Consequently, ppy&#8208;ZnN3 is identified with excellent 2e&#8722; ORR activity (&#951; = 0.08 eV), selectivity, and a low 2e&#8722; ORR kinetic barrier under alkaline condition, which is experimentally verified by its high electrocatalytic H2O2 yield (43 mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) and selectivity (92%) under alkaline condition. Thus, this study provides a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept and performance&#8208;oriented design of nonplanar catalysts with precise coordination configurations and presents a complement to the d&#8208;band theory for more accurately predicting the catalytic activities for nonplanar materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Coverage Tuning for Suppressing Over&#8208;oxidation: A Case of Photoelectrochemical Alcohol&#8208;to&#8208;Aldehyde/Ketone Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Suppressing over&#8208;oxidation is a crucial challenge for various chemical intermediate synthesis in heterogeneous catalysis. The distribution of oxidative species and the substrate coverage, governed by the direction of electron transfer, are believed to influence the oxidation extent. In this study, we present an experimental realization of surface coverage modulation on a photoelectrode using a photo&#8208;induced charge activation method. Through the surface coverage modulation, both pre&#8208;oxidized alcohol substrates and surface coverage are increased, which not only improves the reaction kinetics but also suppresses the over&#8208;oxidation of the generated aldehydes/ketones. As a demonstration, the Faradaic efficiency for the conversion of glycerol to dihydroxyacetone increased from 31.8% to 46.8% (with selectivity rising from 47.6% to 71.3%), from 73.4% to 87.8% for benzyl alcohol to benzyl aldehyde (selectivity increasing from 76.7% to 92.4%) and from 4.2% to 53.6% for ethylene glycol to glycolaldehyde (selectivity increasing from 6.2% to 62.7%). Our findings offer a promising strategy for the production of high&#8208;value carbon products in heterogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO on Ni&#8208;Based Cationic Polymer with TiO2&#8208;Assisted Exfoliation and Stabilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous organic polymers have shown great potential in photocatalytic CO2 reduction due to their unique tunable structure favoring gas adsorption and metal sites integration. However, efficient photocatalysis in porous polymers is greatly limited by the low surface reactivity and electron mobility of bulk structure. Herein, we incorporate TiO2 nanoparticles and Ni(II) sites into a layered cationic imidazolium polymer (IP), in which the imidazolium moieties and free anions can stabilize the key intermediates and enhance the reaction kinetics of CO2 reduction. During the photocatalytic reaction, the layered TiO2/NiIP is in situ exfoliated to nanosheets (NSs) with more accessible active sites and shorten electron transport pathways. The formed TiO2/NiIP&#8208;NSs exhibit an impressively high CO production rate as 54.9 mmol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 with selectivity of 99.9%. The embedding with TiO2 nanoparticles could improve the electron transport efficiency so as to facilitate the photochemical stripping process of layered polymer. Moreover, the exfoliated nanosheets with assistance of TiO2 possess excellent stability during the recycling experiments in comparison to the rapidly declined activity of NiIP&#8208;NSs. This work presents a new strategy to construct highly efficient photocatalysts for CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Phenomics&#8208;based Discovery of Novel Orthosteric Choline Kinase Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Choline kinase alpha (CHKA) is a central mediator of cell metabolism linked to cancer and immune regulation. Cellular and clinical evaluation of CHKA has been hampered by challenges in the development of drug&#8208;like choline kinase inhibitors. Here, we identify CHKA as an unexpected off&#8208;target of histone methyltransferase inhibitors using an integrated phenomic approach. We confirm CHKA as a direct protein target of the aminoquinazolines UNC0638 and UNC0737 using a combination of chemoproteomic, biochemical, cellular, and metabolic profiling assays, possibly explaining the previously reported discrepancies observed for different G9a/GLP inhibitor scaffolds in cellular assays. Using primary human cell model systems, we discover that CHKA modulation impairs IgG secretion and B&#8208;cell maturation consistent with the notion that choline metabolism plays an important role in immune signalling. Co&#8208;crystal structures of UNC0638 and UNC0737 with CHKA unravel an unexpected binding mode and suggest the inhibitors as attractive starting points for the development of selective chemical tools to further explore the biological role of CHKA in cancer and immune metabolism.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Mesoscopic Disorder in Graphitic Carbon with Spectroelectrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>A Bifunctional Imidazolyl Iodide Mediator of Electrolyte Boosts Cathode Kinetics and Anode Stability Towards Low Overpotential and Long&#8208;Life Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The addition of a redox mediator as soluble catalyst into electrolyte can effectively overcome the bottlenecks of poor energy efficiency and limited cyclability for Li&#8208;O2 batteries caused by passivation of insulating discharge products and unfavorable byproducts. Herein we report a novel soluble catalyst of bifunctional imidazolyl iodide salt additive, 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazole iodide (DMII), to successfully construct highly efficient and durable Li&#8208;O2 batteries. The anion I&#8722; can effectively promote the charge transport of Li2O2 and accelerate the redox kinetics of oxygen reduction/oxygen evolution reactions on the cathode side, thereby significantly decreasing the charge/discharge overpotential. Simultaneously, the cation DMI+ forms an ultrathin stably solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase film on Li metal, greatly inhibiting the shuttle effect of I&#8722; and improving the stability of anode. Using this DMII additive, our Li&#8208;O2 batteries achieve an extremely low voltage of 0.52 V and ultra&#8208;long cycling stability over 960 h. Notably, up to 95.8% of the Li2O2 yield further proves the reversible generation/decomposition of Li2O2 without the occurrence of side reactions. Both experimental and theoretical results disclose that DMII enables Li+ easily solvated, testifying the dominance of the solution&#8208;induced reaction mechanism. This work provides the possibility to design the soluble catalysts towards high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;O2 batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed &#945;&#8208;Regioselective Hydroboration of Allenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed regioselective &#945;&#8208;boration of allenes has been achieved. Moreover, this unusual selectivity is not only limited to &#945;&#8208;boration, but also generally applicable to the unprecedented &#945;&#8208;alkynylation and the rarely explored &#945;&#8208;silylation of allenes.







Abstract
Hydroboration of allenes is powerful and atom&#8208;economic approach to the synthesis of organoboranes, such as the highly versatile allylboranes. However, regarding regiocontrol, existing methods uniformly deliver the boron functionality to the less hindered &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;position, but not the &#945;&#8208;position. The latter is particularly challenging for allenes with substantial steric difference between the two terminals and lacking electronic bias (e.g., 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenes). Herein we report the first highly efficient ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration of allenes featuring exclusive &#945;&#8208;regioselectivity, providing access to sterically hindered allyl boranes that are limitedly accessible by conventional methods. DFT studies suggested that the unusual &#945;&#8208;regioselectivity is attributed to the disfavored reductive elimination at the &#947;&#8208;position due to the high energy cost required to overcome the agostic interaction and rotation of the key &#960;&#8208;allyl intermediates. This protocol is also applicable to the previously unprecedented &#945;&#8208;hydroalkynylation and underdeveloped &#945;&#8208;hydrosilylation of allenes, thus complementing known catalytic systems and providing convenient access to highly congested yet densely&#8208;functionalized allyl silanes and skipped enynes bearing a fully&#8208;substituted allylic carbon center. It is expected that this ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed system can serve as a new platform for the development of other hydrofunctionalization processes with unorthodox selectivity.

&lt;p&gt;Hydroboration of allenes is powerful and atom-economic approach to the synthesis of organoboranes, such as the highly versatile allylboranes. However, regarding regiocontrol, existing methods uniformly deliver the boron functionality to the less hindered &#946;- or &#947;-position, but not the &#945;-position. The latter is particularly challenging for allenes with substantial steric difference between the two terminals and lacking electronic bias (e.g., 1,1-disubstituted allenes). Herein we report the first highly efficient ruthenium-catalyzed hydroboration of allenes featuring exclusive &#945;-regioselectivity, providing access to sterically hindered allyl boranes that are limitedly accessible by conventional methods. DFT studies suggested that the unusual &#945;-regioselectivity is attributed to the disfavored reductive elimination at the &#947;-position due to the high energy cost required to overcome the agostic interaction and rotation of the key &#960;-allyl intermediates.

         <title>Cascade&#160;Selenization Regulated the Electronic Structure and Interface Effect of Transition Metal Sulfides for Enhanced Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The utilization of cobalt&#8208;based sulfides is constrained by their inherently low conductivity and slow sodium ion diffusion kinetics. Modifying the electronic configuration and constructing heterostructures are promising strategies to enhance intrinsic conductivity and expedite the sodium ion diffusion process. In this study, heterogeneous nanoparticles of Se&#8208;substituted CoS2/CoSe2, embedded within heteroatom&#8208;modified carbon nanosheet, were synthesized using metal molten salt&#8208;assisted dimensionality reduction alongside concurrent sulfurization and selenization techniques. The incorporation of Se into CoS2&#160;markedly enhances its intrinsic conductivity, thereby significantly improving its rate performance. The elongated Co&#8208;S bonds and the formation of CoSe2&#160;species contribute to the acceleration of dynamics and facilitate the construction of the CoS2/CoSe2&#160;heterointerface. In&#8208;situ&#160;Raman spectroscopy, in conjunction with theoretical calculations, has elucidated the sodium storage mechanism of the Se&#8208;CoS2/CoSe2&#160;and the underlying factors contributing to its enhanced performance. The synergistic effects of electronic structure engineering, have resulted in the optimized Se&#8208;CoS2/CoSe2&#160;demonstrating exceptional rate performance, achieving 442 mAh g&#8722;1&#160;at 10 A g&#8722;1, and a prolonged cycle lifespan, maintaining 409.3 mAh g&#8722;1&#160;at 5 A g&#8722;1&#160;over 2100 cycles&#160;and 262.5 mAh g&#8722;1&#160;after 7000 cycles&#160;at 10 A g&#8722;1. This study presents a viable strategy for integrating electronic structure engineering with interface engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Inverting methanol dehydrogenation selectivity by crowding atomic Ni species over &#945;&#8208;MoC catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal carbides with earth&#8208;abundant elements are widely regarded as promising alternatives of noble metal catalysts. Although comparable catalytic performances have been observed for metal carbides in several types of reactions, precise control of reaction pathways on them remains a formidable challenge, partially due to strong adsorption of reactants or intermediates. In this study, we show that bimolecular dehydrogenation of methanol to methyl formate and H2 is kinetically favored on bare &#945;&#8208;MoC catalysts, while monomolecular dehydrogenation to CO and H2 becomes the dominant pathway when &#945;&#8208;MoC is decorated with crowding atomic Ni species. Under optimal conditions, excellent selectivities of the target products (&gt; 90%) were achieved in both cases, with unprecedented production rates of methyl formate and H2 for the former and latter mechanisms, respectively. Kinetic, spectroscopic, and computational assessments were integrated to clarify the mechanism driving this remarkable selectivity inversion. Isolated Ni sites bound to &#945;&#8208;MoC exhibit superior dehydrogenation activity, which promotes complete cleavage of C&#8208;H bonds in methanol&#8208;derived intermediates rather than the C&#8208;O coupling between them. Our study offers an effective approach to modulating the selectivity of carbide&#8208;based catalysts in alcohol dehydrogenation towards different target products.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering lattice dislocations of TiO2 support of PdZn&#8208;ZnO dual&#8208;site catalysts to boost CO2 hydrogenation to methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CO2 hydrogenation to methanol using green hydrogen derived from renewable resources provides a promising method for sustainable carbon cycle but suffers from high selectivity towards byproduct CO. Here, we develop an efficient PdZn&#8208;ZnO/TiO2 catalyst by engineering lattice dislocation structures of TiO2 support. We discover that this modification orders irregularly arranged atoms in TiO2 to stabilize crystal lattice, and consequently weakens electronic interactions with supported active phases. It facilitates the transformation of metallic Pd into PdZn alloy, effectively suppressing CO production through inhibiting the reverse water&#8208;gas shift reaction mediated by the carboxylate pathway on Pd0 sites. Moreover, it enables the efficient transfer of hydrogen species via hydrogen spillover from PdZn alloy to ZnO for compensating the poor hydrogen dissociation ability of ZnO, thereby creating both more oxygen vacancies essential for CO2 activation and a hydroxyl&#8208;rich environment conducive to hydrogenation of intermediates. These collective modifications on PdZn&#8208;ZnO dual sites synergistically induce the propensity of the formate pathway for methanol synthesis. Consequently, compared to the unmodified catalyst, our as&#8208;designed catalyst increases methanol selectivity from 64.2 to 80.0%, reduces CO selectivity from 35.0 to 19.8%, and achieves an impressive methanol space&#8208;time yield of 9028.0 mgMeOH gPd+Zn&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 at a similar CO2 conversion (~8.0%).</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Microdomain Consistency in Polymer Electrolytes towards Sustainable Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer electrolytes incorporated with fillers possess immense potential for constructing the fast and selective Li+ conduction. However, the inhomogeneous distribution of the fillers usually deteriorates the microdomain consistency of the electrolytes, resulting in uneven Li+ flux, and unstable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces. Herein, we formulate a solution&#8208;process chemistry to in&#8208;situ construct gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) with well&#8208;dispersed metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), leading to a uniform microdomain structure. Through the integration of X&#8208;ray computed tomography analyses and theoretical simulations, our research identifies that the improvement of microdomain consistency in GPEs is beneficial for enhancing its mechanical strength, homogenizing ionic/electronic field distribution and upgrading the interface stability with the elctrodes. Moreover, consistently spread MOFs bind effectively with Lewis&#8208;base anions of Li salts, enhancing Li+ kinetics. Owing to these advantages, the developed GPEs achieve a high conductivity of 1.51 mS cm&#8722;1 and a Li+ transference number of 0.66, resulting in exceptional cyclability of lithium metal electrodes (over 1800 hours). Additionally, the solid&#8208;state NCM811//Li pouch batteries exhibit an impressive capacity retention of 94.2% over 200 cycles with an N/P ratio of 1.69. This study emphasizes the significant impact of microdomain structural chemistry on the advancement of solid&#8208;state batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Cross&#8208;Linked Polymers for Enhanced Thermal Cycling Stability in Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flexible perovskite solar cells (FPSCs) are a promising emerging photovoltaic technology, with certified power conversion efficiencies reaching 26.61%. However, the frequent occurrence of grain fractures and interface delamination raises concerns about their ability to endure the mechanical stresses caused by temperature fluctuations. In this study, we employ an in&#8208;situ polymerization molecule with extended functional end groups to preserve mechanical integrity during thermal cycling. The AMPS&#8208;DEA molecule chemically anchors to grain boundaries and cross&#8208;links neighboring grains, protecting the structure from stress accumulation. Additionally, its hydroxyl groups form bidentate chelation with SnO2, enhancing interfacial adhesion and preventing delamination. More importantly, the relaxed residual stress provided by AMPS&#8208;DEA allows the perovskite layer to adapt to temperature changes, effectively matching adjacent layers and preventing mechanical failure. Our findings demonstrate that AMPS&#8208;DEA modification not only boosts PCE to 25.78% in rigid PSCs and 24.54% in flexible PSCs but also improves stability, maintaining over 95% efficiency after 10,000 bending cycles and 200 thermal cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Reinforcing Coverage of Self&#8208;assembled Monomolecular Layers for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency of 25.70%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAM) as hole transport layers have been widely used in high&#8208;efficiency inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exceeded 26%. However, the poor coverage and non&#8208;uniform distribution on the substrate of SAM further restrict the improvement of device performance. Herein, we utilize the mixed SAM strategy via the MeO&#8208;2PACz along with perfluorotripropylamine (FC&#8208;3283) to improve the SAM coverage, aiming to accelerate the carrier transport, promote the perovskite growth, regulate the surface energy levels and suppress the nonradiative recombination. The champion device with the mixed&#8208;SAM achieves an efficiency of 25.70% (certified efficiency of 25.6%) with long&#8208;term stability (maintained the initial efficiency of 90% after 1000 h and 180 h under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1 and ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2).</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Na+ Transport Pathway and Stable Interface Design Enabling Ultralong Life Solid&#8208;State Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SMBs) using solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) show impressive superiority in energy density and safety. As promising candidates for SPEs, solid&#8208;state plastic crystal electrolytes (SPCE) based on succinonitrile (SN) plastic crystal could achieve high ion conductivity and wide voltage window. Nonetheless, the notorious SN decomposition reaction on the electrode/electrolyte interface seriously challenges the stable operation of the battery. To address this drawback, we commence with the structural engineering of the polymer chain segments in SPCE and employ intermolecular interactions to optimize the composition of solid electrolyte interface (SEI). Moreover, this study elucidates the migration mechanism of sodium ions in SPCE in detail. The assembled sodium symmetric cells display a high critical current density of up to 2.7 mA cm&#8208;2 and stable cycling performance for 700 hours at 0.5 mA cm&#8208;2. Furthermore, the Na/SPCE&#8208;9/Na3V2(PO4)3 maintains a discharge specific capacity of up to 76.8 mAh g&#8208;1 at 10 C and shows impressive long&#8208;cycle stability, retaining 86.2% of initial capacity over 5000 cycles with an average coulombic efficiency of 99.9%. The stability of the SEI construction is meaningful to the cycle life. Our work presents a high&#8208;performance SPCE with intrinsic safety, providing valuable insights for the future design of solid&#8208;state SMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon Dioxide Upgrading to Biodegradable Plastics through Photo/Electro&#8208;Synthetic Biohybrid Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The escalating emissions of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) and the pervasive issue of nondegradable plastic pollution underscore dual urgent challenges in pursuit of a sustainable society. Achieving such sustainability in the plastic industry, while effectively addressing these environmental concerns, necessitates the development and implementation of innovative strategies for the synthesis of biodegradable polymers utilizing CO2 as feedstocks. The technologies not only facilitate the mitigation of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations but also introduce a renewable carbon resource for polymer manufacturing. While considerable research has been undertaken in CO2 upgrading to various C1&#8208;3 products, the production of biodegradable polymers from CO2 remains a formidable challenge. Here, we delineate the principal methodologies for catalytic CO2 upgrading to biodegradable polymers, encompassing photocatalytic&#8208;biological processes and electrocatalytic&#8208;biological approaches. The emphasis of this perspective is on the optimization of production processes and catalyst efficiency, which are paramount in addressing the imperative challenge of decarbonization in the plastic industry, thereby aligning with global environmental sustainability goals.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Rational Design of Confined Catalysis in Carbon Nanotube by Machine Learning and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo Simulations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The microenvironment is recognized to be as crucial as active sites in heterogeneous catalysis. It was found that the catalytic activity of a set of chemical reactions can be significantly influenced by the confined space of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), with some reactions showing superior activity, while others experience a negative impact. The rational design of confined catalysis must rely on the accurate insights of confined microenvironment. However, the structural complexity of confined catalysts and the interaction with microenvironment hinders the deciphering of chemical origins behind experiments. In this work, Grand&#8208;canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations are conducted for confined catalysis in CNTs at various reaction atmospheres, accelerated by machine learning potentials. The statistical outcomes of GCMC simulations corroborate a general feature that the electronic interaction (binding energy) inside CNTs is weaker than outside cases. By using Random Forest (RF) model, we ascertain that the shortening of the bond lengths of catalysts within the confined space is the dominant factor, resulting in the weakened binding energy and the downshift of the d&#8208;band center. Using the bond length variation as a simplified descriptor, our microkinetic models successfully reproduced the seemingly contradictive experiments, namely, the observed enhancement and suppression for the same reaction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In sodium&#8208;ion batteries, the layered transition metal oxides used as cathode often experience interlayer sliding of interlayer spacing and lattice variations during charge/discharge, leading to structural damage and capacity degradation. To address this challenge, a La3+ doping strategy guided by Bayesian optimization has been employed to prepare the high&#8208;performance O3&#8208;NaNi0.39Mn0.50Cu0.06La0.05O2 (NMCL) cathode material. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the O 2p orbital overlaps with the t2g orbital of transition metals in NMCL, facilitating the formation of Na&#8208;O&#8208;La bonds and promoting the oxygen redox reaction kinetics. During the Na&#8314; (de)intercalation process, NMCL exhibits significant negative lattice expansion, characterized by an increase in the c lattice parameter and exceptionally low volume expansion of 1.8% and 3.4%, respectively. Consequently, it delivers an excellent specific capacity of 243.3 mAh g&#8208;1 over a wide voltage range of 2.0 V to 4.5 V, which can be attributed to La3+ doping that promotes oxidation of O2&#8208; to peroxide O2n&#8208; (n &lt; 2) during charge.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing battery longevity by regulating the solvation chemistry of organic iodide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For rechargeable zinc&#8208;iodine batteries, the low electrical conductivity of iodine and the easy dissolution of polyiodide in the electrolyte need to be carefully managed to ensure efficient operation. Herein, we introduce an organic iodized salt, formamidinium iodide (CH5N2I), to modulate the solvation structure of iodide ion, aimed to improve the reaction kinetics of iodine for reversible redox conversion. The participation of formamidinium ion (FA+) into solvation structure leads to the formation of the favorable FAIZn(H2O)42+ complex, facilitating easier desolvation for redox conversion with iodine. Consequently, the inhibited formation of soluble polyiodide efficiently suppresses self&#8208;discharging and improves reversible redox conversion. Specifically, the fabricated battery demonstrates extraordinary cycling stability, with 90.1% capacity retention after 10,000 cycles and high coulombic efficiency of 99.6%. These results provide inspiring principles to develop organohalide materials for high&#8208;performance rechargeable batteries through the solvation modification and interface regulation strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Size&#8208;adjustable High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Nanoparticles as an Efficient Platform for Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high entropy alloy (HEA) possesses distinctive thermal stability and electronic characteristics, which exhibits substantial potential for diverse applications in electrocatalytic reactions. However, accurately controlling the size of HEA still remains a challenge, especially for the ultrasmall HEA nanoparticles. Herein, we firstly calculate and illustrate the size impact on the electronic structure of HEA and the adsorption energies of crucial intermediates in typical electrocatalytic reactions, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) and NO3&#8211; electroreduction (NO3RR). Under the guidance of theoretical calculations, we synthesize a range of ultrasmall PtRuPdCoNi HEA nanoparticles with adjustable sizes (1.7, 2.3, 3.0, and 3.9 nm) using a one&#8208;step spatially confined approach. Specifically, HEA nanoparticles with 1.7 nm size (HEA&#8208;1.7) endows a 16 mV overpotential at current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2, yielding a mass activity of 31.9 A mgNM&#8208;1 of noble metal in HER, significantly outperforming commercial Pt/C catalyst. This strategy can also be easily applicable to other reduction reactions attributed to the richness of metal components and size adjustability, presenting a promising platform for various electrocatalytic applications as advanced catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Growth of Covalent Organic Frameworks on Carbon Nanotubes for High&#8208;Performance Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox&#8208;active covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been demonstrated as promising organic electrodes in many electrochemical devices. However, their inherently low conductivity significantly hinders the full utilization of their internal redox&#8208;active sites. To address this issue, a simple solvothermal method is used to in situ polymerize 2,4,6&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol (TP) and p&#8208;phenylenediamine (PA) on the surface of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), generating a nanocable&#8208;like COF&#8208;based nanocomposite, TpPa&#8208;COF@CNT nanocables, which contain abundant &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine groups. By combining the high specific surface area and dense active sites of COFs with the superior conductivity of CNTs, the TpPa&#8208;COF@CNT nanocables as the anode in potassium&#8208;ion batteries displayed excellent performance. The reason is that the isomerization between the enolic and keto forms reinforces the stability of molecular architecture, while the transformation of active sites from C=N to C=O improves the K+ adsorption capability. Notably, the TpPa&#8208;COF@CNT nanocable anode exhibits a high reversible capacity of 446.1 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1 and maintains 282.5 mAh g&#8722;1 even after 2000 cycles at a higher current density of 2.0 A g&#8722;1. Additionally, a full battery assembled with 3,4,9,10&#8208;Perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride heat&#8208;treated at 450 &#176;C as the cathode retains a reversible capacity of 273.6 mAh g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles at 0.1 A g&#8722;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Oxidative Coupling of Methane to Ethane Using CO2 as a Soft Oxidant Over the Au/TiO2&#8208;Vo Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we first report a photocatalytic OCM using CO2 as a soft oxidant for C2H6 production under mild conditions, where an efficient photocatalyst with unique interface sites is constructed to facilitate CO2 adsorption and activation, while concurrently boosting CH4 dissociation. As a prototype, the Au quantum dots anchored on oxygen&#8208;deficient TiO2 nanosheets are fabricated, where the Au&#8208;Vo&#8208;Ti interface sites for CO2 adsorption and activation are collectively disclosed by in situ Kelvin probe force microscopy, quasi in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. Compared with single metal site, the Au&#8208;Vo&#8208;Ti interface sites exhibit the lower CO2 adsorption energy and decrease the energy barrier of the *CO2 hydrogenation step from 1.05 to 0.77 eV via Au&#8208;C and Ti&#8208;O dual&#8208;site bonding. The adsorbed CO2&#160;reduces the energy barrier of *CH4 dissociation to *CH3 from 2.13 to 1.59 eV, contributing to CH4 oxidation. Additionally, in situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy unveils the Au site facilitates ethane production by engaging in *CH3&#8208;Au interaction and accelerating CH3&#8208;CH3 coupling. Thus, the photocatalyst demonstrates a high C2H6 evolution rate of 2.60 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 for OCM using CO2 as the soft oxidant, surpassing most of previously reported photocatalysts regardless of OCM and nonoxidative coupling of methane.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Dicarboxylation of Vinyl Epoxide with CO2 for the Facile and Selective Synthesis of Diacids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a novel electrochemical dicarboxylation of epoxides with CO2, characterized by the cleavage of two C&#8211;O single bonds. Not only are vinyl epoxides viable, but cyclic carbonates also serve as effective substrates, facilitating the synthesis of E&#8208;configured adipic and octanedioic acids with high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity. The synthetic practicality is further highlighted by the diverse functionalizations of the resulting multifunctional diacids. Mechanistic studies support the single&#8208;electron transfer reduction of CO2 to its radical anion, which undergoes radical addition to the vinyl moiety of epoxides. The subsequent reductive cleavage of two C&#8211;O bonds, coupled with a nucleophilic attack on CO2, culminates in the formation of the desired diacid products.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulating Interphase Chemistry for Aqueous Zn Stabilization: The Role of Supersaturation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The limited cycling durability of Zn anode, attributed to the absence of a robust electrolyte&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), remains the bottleneck for the practical deployment of aqueous zinc batteries.

         <title>A Trithia&#8208;Bridged N&#8208;Heterotriangulene: The Hitherto Missing Electron Donor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented triphenylamine with three sulfur ortho bridges has been developed as the very first representative of the hitherto elusive family of electron donors. The compound is readily oxidized to the corresponding radical cation with exceptional stability and forms crystalline donor&#8208;acceptor complexes with cyano&#8208;based acceptors.







Abstract
The very first representative of trithia&#8208;bridged N&#8208;heterotriangulene, a triphenylamine with sulfur atoms bridging the ortho&#8208;positions, was synthesized by a sequence of regioselective sulfenylation with phthalimidesulfenyl chloride followed by Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed electrophilic cyclization. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed a saddle&#8208;shaped geometry of the polycyclic scaffold. UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry were used to characterize the optoelectronic properties. The title compound is a particularly strong electron donor forming a perfectly stable radical cation, which was analyzed by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The electron donor properties were further highlighted by the formation of crystalline donor&#8208;acceptor complexes with strong cyano&#8208;based acceptors.

         <title>Reactive Intermediate Confinement in Beta Zeolites for the Efficient Aerobic Epoxidation of &#945;&#8208;Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the Mukaiyama epoxidation reaction, the channels of Beta zeolite can restrict the formation of undesired intermediates and only accomodate the epoxidation intermediate, thereby enhancing the selectivity of the epoxidation reaction and coupling effiency of aldehyde.







Abstract
The efficient conversion of long&#8208;chain linear &#945;&#8208;olefins (LAOs) into industrially useful epoxides is of pivotal importance. Mukaiyama epoxidation based on the use of molecular oxygen as the sole oxidant and aldehyde as the cosubstrate offers a promising route for LAOs epoxidation. However, challenges associated with epoxide forming selectivity and aldehyde coupling efficiency have long impeded the adoption of Mukaiyama epoxidation in large&#8208;scale applications. Herein, we show that confinement of key intermediates involved in the parallel epoxidation pathways within a Beta zeolite unlocks a selectivity of greater than 95&#8201;% towards the epoxides at the expense of minimal consumption of only 1.5&#8197;equivalents of the aldehyde, achieving an efficiency better than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. Moreover, the incorporation of Sn sites into the Beta zeolite framework further facilitates the adsorption activation process of the aldehyde cosubstrate, thereby increasing the concentration of acylperoxy radicals and accelerating the kinetic process of the epoxidation step. Consequently, this work not only provides an efficient and green epoxidation route over zeolite catalysts with easily available O2 as the oxidant, but also systematically reveals the fundamental understanding of the zeolite confinement effects on steering the reaction pathway, which benefits the further development of valorization of LAOs.

         <title>Boosting Adsorption and Selectivity of Acetylene by Nitro Functionalisation in Copper(II)&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isostructural MOF materials, MFM&#8208;190(R) (R=&#8722;F, &#8722;CH3, &#8722;NO2) exhibit exceptional acetylene (C2H2) adsorption and selectivity. MFM&#8208;190(NO2) shows a high C2H2 uptake of 216&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1 bar, 298&#8197;K and excellent C2H2/CO2 selectivity (up to ~150 for v/v = 2/1). Dynamic breakthrough experiments confirm efficient separation under ambient conditions, supported by in situ neutron powder diffraction studies revealing cooperative binding of C2H2 at unsaturated Cu(II) and &#8722;NO2 sites.







Abstract
Purification and storage of acetylene (C2H2) are important to many industrial processes. The exploitation of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) materials to address the balance between selectivity for C2H2 vs carbon dioxide (CO2) against maximising uptake of C2H2 has attracted much interest. Herein, we report that the synergy between unsaturated Cu(II) sites and functional groups, fluoro (&#8722;F), methyl (&#8722;CH3), nitro (&#8722;NO2) in a series of isostructural MOF materials MFM&#8208;190(R) that show exceptional adsorption and selectivity of C2H2. At 298&#8197;K, MFM&#8208;190(NO2) exhibits an C2H2 uptake of 216&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 (320&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 273&#8197;K) at 1.0&#8197;bar and a high selectivity for C2H2/CO2 (up to ~150 for v/v = 2/1) relevant to that in the industrial cracking stream. Dynamic breakthrough studies validate and confirm the excellent separation of C2H2/CO2 by MFM&#8208;190(NO2) under ambient conditions. In situ neutron powder diffraction reveals the cooperative binding, packing and selectivity of C2H2 by unsaturated Cu(II) sites and free &#8722;NO2 groups.

         <title>Anomalous Role of Carbon in Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface carbonaceous species can frustrate ethylene adsorption on catalyst surfaces by confinement effect, thus facilitating its desorption as opposed to overhydrogenation to form undesired ethane. This mechanism for selectivity control is analogous to enzyme catalysis, where the active centers selectively attract reactants and release products. Similar mechanism might be present in CO/CO2 hydrogenation and alkane dehydrogenation reactions.







Abstract
Carbonaceous species, including subsurface carbidic carbon and surface carbon, play crucial roles in heterogeneous catalysis. Many reports suggested the importance of subsurface carbon in the selective hydrogenation of alkynes over Pd&#8208;based catalysts. However, the role of surface carbon has been largely overlooked. We demonstrate that subsurface carbon in Pd is not responsible for the selectivity in acetylene hydrogenation. In contrast, the structure of surface carbonaceous species plays a decisive role in hydrogenation selectivity. Electron microscopy and spectroscopy evidence, along with theoretical modelling, reveal that partial graphitization of surface carbonaceous species results in unique spatial confinement of surface reaction intermediates, thus altering the reaction energy landscape in favour of ethylene desorption as opposed to over&#8208;hydrogenation. This mechanism for selectivity control is analogous to enzyme catalysis, where the active centers selectively attract reactants and release products. Similar mechanism may be present in CO/CO2 hydrogenation and alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Precision Activity&#8208;Based &#945;&#8208;Amylase Probes for Dissection and Annotation of Linear and Branched&#8208;Chain Starch&#8208;Degrading Enzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activity&#8208;based probes were designed as a method to annotate substrate specificity of retaining &#945;&#8208;amylases. Fluorescent probes were used in activity&#8208;based protein profiling experiments with pure protein, a prominent gut microbe and in a species&#8208;rich composter sample. Proteomics experiments were performed to identify, and annotate the substrate specificity of, novel &#945;&#8208;amylases with favourable properties for the industrial processing of starch.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Amylases are the workhorse enzymes of starch degradation. They are central to human health, including as targets for anti&#8208;diabetic compounds, but are also the key enzymes in the industrial processing of starch for biofuels, corn syrups, brewing and detergents. Dissection of the activity, specificity and stability of &#945;&#8208;amylases is crucial to understanding their biology and allowing their exploitation. Yet, functional characterization lags behind DNA sequencing and genomics; and new tools are required for rapid analysis of &#945;&#8208;amylase function. Here, we design, synthesize and apply new branched &#945;&#8208;amylase activity&#8208;based probes. Using both &#945;&#8208;1,6 branched and unbranched &#945;&#8208;1,4 maltobiose activity&#8208;based probes we were able to explore the stability and substrate specificity of both a panel of human gut microbial &#945;&#8208;amylases and a panel of industrially relevant &#945;&#8208;amylases. We also demonstrate how we can detect and annotate the substrate specificity of &#945;&#8208;amylases in the complex cell lysate of both a prominent gut microbe and a diverse compost sample by in&#8208;gel fluorescence and mass spectrometry. A toolbox of starch&#8208;active activity&#8208;based probes will enable rapid functional dissection of &#945;&#8208;amylases. We envisage activity&#8208;based probes contributing to better selection and engineering of enzymes for industrial application as well as fundamental analysis of enzymes in human health.

         <title>Programmable Self&#8208;Assembly from Two&#8208;Dimensional Nanosheets to Spiral, Twisted and Branched Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembly is an ideal strategy for synthesizing hierarchical materials, but remains great challenges due to the multiple non&#8208;covalent interactions in the assembly process. Herein a programmable assembly strategy was proposed to customize assembled structure. The assembled structures were transformed from nanosheet structure to spiral, twisted and branched structures by controlling screw dislocation growth and epitaxial growth mechanisms.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of nanomaterials into hierarchical structure is of great interest to fabricate functional materials. However, programmable design of the assembled structures remains a great challenge. Herein, we reported a programmable self&#8208;assembly strategy to customize the assembled structure. The self&#8208;assembly strategy is designed to orderly transform the two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Ca ions assembled F127 nanosheets (Ca&#8208;F127 NSs) into spiral nanosheet structures (S&#8208;Ca&#8208;F127 NSs), branched nanosheet structures (B&#8208;Ca&#8208;F127 NSs), branched&#8208;spiral nanosheet structures (B&#8208;S&#8208;Ca&#8208;F127 NSs), and twisted&#8208;branched structures (T&#8208;Ca&#8208;F127 NBs). Wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (WAXS) and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) indicate that these different structures maintain the same orthorhombic phase and Ca&#8208;O octahedral coordination structure. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) in the double&#8208;tilt liquid nitrogen cooling holder identifies the Eshelby twist in the twisted structures, demonstrating the spiral structure are formed by screw dislocation growth. Cryo&#8208;electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;EM) proves the oriented epitaxial growth in the B&#8208;Ca&#8208;F127 NSs. Furthermore, the formation mechanisms of spiral structure and branched structure can be recombined to form complex hierarchical structures. The epitaxial growth along screw dislocation can lead to the formation of B&#8208;S&#8208;Ca&#8208;F127 NSs, while the twisted epitaxial growth in the screw dislocation can lead to the formation of T&#8208;Ca F127 NBs.

         <title>Chemical Upcycling of Thermoplastics Towards Thermosets Based on Dynamic Dimethylglyoxime&#8208;Urethane Moiety</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Current strategies for recycling thermoplastic polymer waste are economically unattractive and/or degenerative in the mechanical properties. Herein, we propose an economic strategy that can be used to reversibly transform the linear polymer waste towards crosslinked materials with reinforced mechanical properties.







Abstract
Huge annual consumption of thermoplastics results in the generation of large amounts of waste after their service life. Currently, the most popular recycling method based on mechanically melt&#8208;reprocessing deteriorates the material performance and is economically unattractive, which makes it unviable to be implemented in large scale. Herein, we present a chemical upcycling strategy that can transform dimethylglyoxime&#8208;urethane based thermoplastic waste into thermoset product with superior mechanical properties and higher economic values than the initial one. It is found that the dimethylglyoxime&#8208;urethane moiety has dynamic nature, endowing the material with open&#8208;loop upcycling ability. By removing the dimethylglyoxime segment via a simple sublimation process, the material structure is transformed from linear molecular into crosslinked network. More interestingly, the transformation is reversible, and the regenerated crosslinked network can be transformed back to linear molecule by returning the removed dimethylglyoxime segment to the material, which means the upcycled product can be recycled again after its service life. Our linear/crosslinked transformation strategy provide a new option for recycling thermoplastic waste.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Nanometer Pt Nanowires with Disordered Shells for Highly Active Elelctrocatalytic Oxidation of Formic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt sub&#8208;nanometer nanowires, which feature a unique architecture with a monoatomic&#8208;layer surface of disordered, bonding&#8208;unsaturated Pt atoms surrounding a crystalline core as narrow as 0.58&#8197;nm in diameter, are succsessfully synthesized. It significantly boosts the electrochemical surface area and catalytic efficiency for formic acid oxidation, a key reaction in direct formic acid fuel cells, which have the potential to outperform current battery technologies for lightweight, long&#8208;lasting portable power.







Abstract
Controlled synthesis of one&#8208;dimensional materials at atomic&#8208;scale dimensions represents a milestone in nanotechnology, offering the potential to maximize atom utilization while enhancing catalytic performance. However, achieving structural stability and durability at such fine scales requires precise control over material structure and local chemical environment. Here, we introduce dimethylamine (DMA) as a small&#8208;molecule modifier, in contrast to conventional long&#8208;chain surfactants, to interact with surface Pt atoms. This approach facilitates the removal of surface Pt atoms bonded to nitrogen atoms in DMA during solubilization in water, effectively stripping the size of Pt nanowires down to sub&#8208;nanometer. The resulting Pt subnanometer nanowires (subNWs) feature a monoatomic&#8208;layer surface composed of disordered, bonding&#8208;unsaturated Pt atoms, and an interior crystalline core as narrow as 0.58&#8197;nm in diameter. These unique structural characteristics confer the Pt subNWs with an electrochemically active surface&#8208;area of 189&#8197;m2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 during formic acid oxidation. Furthermore, the amorphous&#8208;like surface structure lowers the free energy of *OCOH intermediates and inhibits the formation of toxic byproducts CO, demonstrating exceptional electrocatalytic activity of 18.1&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mg&#8722;1, surpassing most reported Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Our work introduces a novel strategy for the controlled construction of nanowire&#8208;structures at sub&#8208;nanometer scale, effectively bridging the gap between ultrafine structural design and performance stability.

Our work introduces a novel strategy for the controlled construction of nanowire-structures at sub-nanometer scale, effectively bridging the gap between ultrafine structural design and performance stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Insights Into the Role of &#960;&#8208;Electrons of Aromatic Aldehydes in Passivating Perovskite Defects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of &#960;&#8208;electrons in the carbonyl&#8208;containing aromatic materials on their passivation ability was thoroughly investigated. With the increase of aromatic conjugated system, the increased &#960;&#8208;electrons mainly enhance the defect passivation of the carbonyl group, although they do not directly present strong passivation with the defects in the perovskite films. Finally, perovskite solar cells incorporating pyrene&#8208;1&#8208;carbaldehyde achieved power conversion efficiencies of 25.67&#8201;% (0.09&#8197;cm2) and 21.76&#8201;% (14.0&#8197;cm2) with excellent long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
Carbonyl&#8208;containing aromatic ketones or aldehydes have been demonstrated to be effective defect passivators for perovskite films to improve performances of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). It has been claimed that both &#960;&#8208;electrons within aromatic units and carbonyl groups can, separately, interact with ionic defects, which, however, causes troubles in understanding the passivation mechanism of those aromatic ketone/aldehyde molecules. Herein, we clarify the effect of both moieties in one molecule on the defect passivation by investigating three aromatic aldehydes with varied conjugation planes, namely, biphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;carbaldehyde (BPCA), naphthalene&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehyde (NACA) and pyrene&#8208;1&#8208;carbaldehyde (PyCA). Our findings reveal that the &#960;&#8208;electrons located in the conjugated system do not directly present strong passivation for defects, but enhance the electron cloud density of the carbonyl group augmenting its interaction with defect sites; thereby, with the extended conjugation plane of the three molecules, their defect passivation ability is gradually improved. PSCs incorporating PyCA with the most extended &#960;&#8208;electrons delocalization achieve maximum power conversion efficiencies of 25.67&#8201;% (0.09&#8197;cm2) and 21.76&#8201;% (14.0&#8197;cm2). Moreover, these devices exhibit outstanding long&#8208;term stability, retaining 95&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after operation for 1000&#8197;hours at the maximum power point.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Constructed Core&#8208;Shell Catalyst Enabling Subzero Capacity Unlocking of Cost&#8208;Effective and Long&#8208;Life Vanadium Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8197;situ constructed Cu@Cu6Sn5 core&#8208;shell catalyst is shown to enhance redox kinetics of V2+/V3+ and selectively inhibit hydrogen evolution side reaction, achieving stable operation over 1200&#8197;cycles and enabling subzero capacity unlocking for cost&#8208;effective vanadium flow batteries.







Abstract
Vanadium flow battery (VFB) promises a route for achieving grid&#8208;scale power storage by harnessing renewable energy sources. However, the sluggish reaction kinetics of vanadium redox couples and serious hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) still restrict the further development of VFB. Addressing these challenges requires not only effective solutions but also ones that are cost&#8208;efficient and scalable to meet the demands of affordable energy storage. Here, we present an in&#8197;situ constructed Cu@Cu6Sn5 core&#8208;shell catalyst by incorporating metal ions into the electrolyte. The Cu core, encapsulated by the Cu6Sn5 shell, forms an excellent conductive pathway to the graphite felt electrode. Charge transfer between Cu and Sn within Cu6Sn5 shell accelerates the reaction kinetics of V2+/V3+ redox couple and selectively inhibits HER, as confirmed through in&#8197;situ weak measurement imaging method. The Cu@Cu6Sn5 battery achieves a peak power density of 1119.1&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1350&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, operates stably for 1200&#8197;cycles without catalyst failure, and is available over a wide&#8208;temperature range. Furthermore, we identify a demand of subzero capacity unlocking. Achieving a 23.4&#8201;% theoretical capacity unlocking at &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C with a cut&#8208;off voltage up to 1.75&#8197;V, bespeaking a crucial breakthrough toward cost&#8208;effective VFB.

         <title>Air&#8208;Mediated Biomimetic Synthesis of Polyhydroxyalkanoate with C4 Diol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported a strategy that utilizes a ruthenium&#8208;phosphorus synergistic catalytic system, mimicking enzyme&#8208;coenzyme functionality, to efficiently catalyze the air&#8208;mediated oxidation of the C4 diol, 1,4&#8208;butanediol, to produce the intermediate monomer &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone. This monomer is then used in ring&#8208;opening polymerization to synthesize high molecular weight polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) products extracellularly.







Abstract
Poly(4&#8208;hydroxybutyrate) (P4HB) is a high&#8208;performance, well&#8208;recyclable, and biodegradable polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA). However, conventional bioproduction of homopolymeric P4HB involves complex and costly processes with C4 feedstocks, particularly 1,4&#8208;butanediol (BDO), and enzyme&#8208;coenzyme systems in genetically engineered bacteria. An alternative extracellular chemical route utilizing aerial oxidation of BDO offers cost and energy benefits but struggle with conversion efficiency. Inspired by efficient intracellular oxidation of primary alcohols, we propose a ruthenium&#8208;phosphine synergistic catalytic system that mimics enzyme&#8208;coenzyme functionality. This system effectively catalyzed the air&#8208;mediated, solvent&#8208;free oxidation of BDO to produce &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone (&#947;&#8208;BL) and oligomeric P4HB, with a space&#8208;time yield (10.37&#8197;g [&#947;&#8208;BL unit] g&#8722;1 catalyst h&#8722;1) surpassing the values (&lt;5.5) of previous approaches. The oligomer&#8208;containing products were reversibly converted to &#947;&#8208;BL and then to P4HB (28.9&#8197;kDa) via ring&#8208;opening polymerization, exceeding reported values (&lt;16&#8197;kDa). This study provides the potential for large&#8208;scale synthesis of high&#8208;value PHAs from diverse non&#8208;grain&#8208;based diols, offering economic and environmental advantages.

PTZ&#8208;SAMs with various aromatic linkers and linking orientations were designed and synthesized as the hole&#8208;selective layer (HSL) in inverted wide&#8208;band gap perovskite solar cells (PSCs). &#946;&#8208;NapPAPT could form dense and highly ordered HSLs, enhancing interfacial interactions and favoring optimal energy level alignment with the perovskite films.







Abstract
Aromatic linker&#8208;constructed self&#8208;assembled monolayers (Ar&#8208;SAMs) with enlarged dipole moment can modulate the work function of indium tin oxide (ITO), thereby improving hole extraction/transport efficiency. However, the specific role of the aromatic linkers between the polycyclic head and the anchoring groups of SAMs in determining the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) remains unclear. In this study, we developed a series of phenothiazine&#8208;based Ar&#8208;SAMs to investigate how different aromatic linkers could affect molecular stacking, the regulation of substrate work function, and charge carrier dynamics. When served as hole&#8208;selective layers (HSLs) in PSCs and monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (P/S&#8208;TSCs), we found that the Ar&#8208;SAM with naphthalene linker along the 2,6&#8208;position axis (&#946;&#8208;Nap) could form dense and highly ordered HSLs, enhancing interfacial interactions and favoring optimal energy level alignment with the perovskite films. Using this strategy, the optimized wide&#8208;band gap PSCs achieved an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.86&#8201;% with negligible hysteresis, utilizing a 1.68&#8197;eV perovskite. Additionally, the encapsulated devices demonstrated enhanced stability under damp&#8208;heat conditions (ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;2, 50&#8201;% RH, 65&#8201;&#176;C) with a T91 of 1000&#8197;hours. Notably, the fabricated P/S&#8208;TSCs, based on solution&#8208;processed micron&#8208;scale textured silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells, achieved an efficiency of 28.89&#8201;% while maintaining outstanding reproducibility. This strategy holds significant promise for developing aromatic linking groups to enhance the hole selectivity of SAMs.

         <title>Halting Oxygen Evolution to Achieve Long Cycle Life in Sodium Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;voltage oxygen redox chemistries show promise for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathodes but are hindered by oxygen instability and structural degradation. We propose an entropy&#8208;enforced strategy to induce electronic structure disorder (ESD) at high desodiation, impeding oxygen mobility and suppressing structural changes. The high&#8208;entropy state induced by cationic disordering also perturbs cationic redox boundaries, constraining the phase distortion.







Abstract
Oxygen redox chemistries at high voltage have materialized as a revolutionary paradigm for cathodes with high&#8208;energy density; however, they are plagued by the challenges of labile oxygen loss and rapid degradations upon cycling, even after concerted endeavors from the research community. Here we propose a multi&#8208;concentration stratagem propelled by entropy reinforcement to enhance the electronic structure disorder (ESD) at high desodiation states for impeding undesired oxygen mobility and ensuring controlled oxygen activity, elucidated by density functional theory calculations. The increased disorder strengthens the reversible electrochemistry of lattice oxygen redox, leading to effectively suppressed P&#8722;O structural evolution and highly stable localized TMO6 octahedral environments, as demonstrated by soft/hard X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. Furthermore, through a comparative analysis of sodium&#8208;layered cathodes with different configuration entropy, we reveal that a high&#8208;entropy state induced by cationic disordering has the capacity to perturb cationic redox boundaries, significantly restraining the formation of detrimental O&#8242;3 phases. As a consequence, the high&#8208;voltage cycling stability has been greatly upgraded, up to 4.4&#8197;V versus Na+/Na, with an impressive 90.1&#8201;% capacity retention at 1&#8197;C over 100 cycles and 76.1&#8201;% capacity retention at 2&#8197;C over 300 cycles. The resilient oxygen redox, enabled through the control of ESD, broadens the horizons for entropy engineering and lays the foundation for advancements in high&#8208;energy, long&#8208;cycling, and safe batteries.

         <title>Photosynthesis of H2O2 using Phenothiazine&#8208;Based Covalent&#8208;Organic Frameworks Mimicking Coenzyme Q</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report COFs based on oxidized phenothiazine to emulate Coenzyme Q, enhancing charge transfer and H2O2 synthesis efficiency. The PTH&#8208;SO2&#8208;COF showed a 7755&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 synthesis rate, a 720&#8201;% improvement over PTH&#8208;S&#8208;COF, reaching 13565&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 upon adjusting the sacrificial agent ratio. In situ characterizations and simulations confirmed three H2O2 evolution pathways, advancing high&#8208;performance COF&#8208;based photocatalysts through artificial enzyme&#8208;mimicking.







Abstract
Mimicking natural enzymes through artificial enzyme engineering represents a powerful strategy to fine&#8208;tune the performance of photocatalysts, while the manipulation of electron transfer systems through atomic precision control is challenging. Herein, we reported a series of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) based on progressively oxidized phenothiazine (PTH) core as the platform for emulating Coenzyme Q, achieved through meticulous stepwise adjustments of their redox states. Compared to the original PTH&#8208;S&#8208;COF, the COFs with incrementally oxidized sulfur sites exhibited enhanced charge transfer efficiencies, facilitating efficient electron donation to O2 and thereby providing a favorable pathway for H2O2 synthesis. Notably, the PTH&#8208;SO2&#8208;COF achieved a remarkable synthesis rate of 7755&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, marking a 720&#8201;% improvement over the PTH&#8208;S&#8208;COF baseline. Furthermore, upon adjusting the sacrificial agent ratio, this rate soared to an impressive 13565&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, surpassing the most reported photo&#8208;active COFs. In situ characterizations and simulations verified that three H2O2 evolution pathways (2e&#8722; ORR, 4e&#8722; OER, and 4e&#8722; ORR) all involved in the H2O2 production process. As a result, our findings introduce a novel pathway for the development of high&#8208;performance COF&#8208;based photocatalysts through the innovative application of artificial enzyme&#8208;mimicking techniques.

         <title>Unusual Endotaxy Growth of Hexagonal Nanosheets by the Self&#8208;Assembly of a Homopolymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A classical crystallization usually grows epitaxially from a crystal nucleus. Presented in this study is an unusual endotaxy growth manner of a crystalline homopolymer to form hexagonal nanosheets. The amphiphilic homopolymer, poly(3&#8208;(4&#8208;(phenyldiazenyl)phenoxy)propyl methacrylate) (PAzoPMA), is first annealed in isopropanol to afford a hexagonal nut&#8208;like structure. Then, the PAzoPMA crystallizes from the inner wall to the center to form a thin bottom, which grows upwards along the bottom, leading to the formation of the evenly hexagonal nanosheets. The energy fluctuation by Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation during self&#8208;assembly confirms the packing state of PAzoPMA chains in different solvents. In isopropanol, the total energy is the lowest, demonstrating the tight regular arrangement of polymer chains. In addition, the non&#8208;bonding interaction energy is the lowest, leading to the favorable contact with solvent molecules and the formation of hexagonal nanosheets. Otherwise, nanowires and giant large compound micelles are formed in ethanol and n&#8208;butanol. Overall, an unusual endotaxy crystallization manner of an amphiphilic homopolymer is observed during the preparation of hexagonal nanosheets, which brings fresh insight for understanding crystallization behavior of polymers and preparing functional soft nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong Heteroatomic Bond&#8208;Induced Confined Restructuring on Ir&#8208;Mn Intermetallics Enable Robust PEM Water Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low&#8208;iridium acid&#8208;stabilized electrocatalysts for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are crucial for the market deployment of proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. Manipulating the in situ reconstruction of Ir&#8208;based catalysts with favorable kinetics is highly desirable but remains elusive. Herein, we propose an atomic ordering strategy to modulate the dynamic surface restructuring of catalysts to break the activity/stability trade&#8208;off. Under working conditions, the strong heteroatom&#8208;bonded structure triggers rational surface&#8208;confined reconstruction to form self&#8208;stabilizing amorphous (oxy)hydroxides on the model Ir&#8208;Mn intermetallic (IMC). Combined in&#8208;situ/ex&#8208;situ characterizations and theoretical analysis demonstrate that the induced strong covalent Ir&#8208;O&#8208;Mn units in the catalytic layer weaken the formation barrier of OOH* and promote the preferential dynamic replenishment/conversion pathway of H2O molecules to suppress the uncontrollable participation of lattice oxygen (about 2.6 times lower than that of pure Ir).

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Low-iridium acid-stabilized electrocatalysts for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are crucial for the market deployment of proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. Manipulating the in situ reconstruction of Ir-based catalysts with favorable kinetics is highly desirable but remains elusive. Herein, we propose an atomic ordering strategy to modulate the dynamic surface restructuring of catalysts to break the activity/stability trade-off. Under working conditions, the strong heteroatom-bonded structure triggers rational surface-confined reconstruction to form self-stabilizing amorphous (oxy)hydroxides on the model Ir-Mn intermetallic (IMC). Combined in-situ/ex-situ characterizations and theoretical analysis demonstrate that the induced strong covalent Ir-O-Mn units in the catalytic layer weaken the formation barrier of OOH* and promote the preferential dynamic replenishment/conversion pathway of H2O molecules to suppress the uncontrollable participation of lattice oxygen (about 2.6 times lower than that of pure Ir). Thus, a PEM cell with Ir-Mn IMC as anode &#8220;pre-electrocatalyst&#8221; (0.24 mgIr cm&#8722;2) delivers an impressive performance (3.0 A cm&#8722;2@1.851 V@80 &#176;C) and runs stably at 2.0 A cm&#8722;2 for more than 2,000 h with the cost of USD 0.98 per kg H2, further validating its promising application.

         <title>Enhanced Electrochemiluminescence by Knocking Out Gold Active Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Passivating oxide formation in ideal gold electrodes reflects in weaker ECL intensity of conventional [Ru(bpy)3]2+/TPrA systems. Such hampering behavior were eliminated by selective knocking out of surface asperities and catalytic deactivation via Cu&#8208;Fenton reagent. Results exhibited 2.7&#8208;fold increase in ECL intensity with switching mechanism from direct oxidation to catalytic pathway.







Abstract
Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) of the conventional system of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ luminophore and amine&#8208;based coreactants is particularly inefficient on noble metal electrodes. This is due to the formation of a passivating oxide layer on the metal surface inhibiting the electro&#8208;oxidation of amines like tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine (TPrA) coreactant. Herein, we demonstrated the enhancement of ECL emission on gold surface by hydroxyl radicals attack that are chemically generated with Cu&#8208;Fenton reagent. These radicals selectively deactivate the gold active sites and knockout the metal surface asperities that counterintuitively led to an amplification of the ECL emission. Atomic force microscopy shows a massive smoothening of the surface. The electrochemical characterization proves that the involved ECL reaction mechanism switches from direct oxidation to catalytic route, where the kinetics of indirect TPrA oxidation is facilitated on deactivated gold surface. Besides, in situ smoothening of a rough electrode in presence of tandem [Ru(bpy)3]2+/TPrA enables Cu2+ sensing with good reliability and limit of detection. Such atomically smoothened and corrosion&#8208;resistant gold surface readily tuned the ECL reactivity and opened new directions on influence of topography and reactivity on ECL mechanisms, thus will be extremely useful for the future development of ECL imaging strategies and highly sensitive ECL sensors.

         <title>Generating Strong Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Self&#8208;assembled Films of Chiral Selenium Nanoparticles and Upconversion Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has garnered significant research attention. Achieving a high luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) is a key challenge in this field. Herein, we reported, for the first time, the fabrication of a chiral assembled film consisting of chiral D&#8208;/L&#8208;Selenium nanoparticles (D&#8208;/L&#8208;Se NPs) and DSPE&#8208;PEG&#8208;NH2 modified upconversion nanoparticles (DPNUCNPs) with remarkable CPL properties that were generated by the interfacial self&#8208;assembly technique. The chiral Se/DPNUCNPs films, consisting of three layers (3L) of D&#8208;/L&#8208;Se films and 3L DPNUCNPs films, exhibited the highest circular dichroism (CD) response and the strongest CPL signals. Under laser excitation at 980 nm, the 3L D&#8208;/L&#8208;Se/3L DPNUCNPs assembled films displayed symmetric CPL signals between 400 and 600 nm, with a maximum |glum| value of 0.68. The interaction between DPNUCNPs and Se NPs involves energy transfer and chirality transfer, along with the formation of spin&#8208;polarized excitons, thereby resulting in CPL activity. Furthermore, the chiral Se/DPNUCNPs films were patterned for anti&#8208;counterfeit and encryption applications. Our study provides a novel guide for fabricating chiral nanomaterials with strong CPL response.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The in&#8208;depth research on the charge transport properties of BN&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (BN&#8208;PAHs) still lags far behind studies of their emitting properties. Herein, we report the successfully synthesis of novel ladder&#8208;type BN&#8208;PAHs (BCNL1 and BCNL2) featuring a highly ordered BC3N2 acene unit, achieved via a nitrogen&#8208;directed tandem C&#8208;H borylation. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis unambiguously revealed their unique and compact herringbone packing structures. Micro&#8208;sized single&#8208;crystalline organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) demonstrated that an enhanced charge transport capability, with BCNL2 achieving a hole mobility of up to 0.62 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1&#8212;three orders of magnitude higher than that of BCNL1 (&#956;hmax = 6 &#215; 10&#8208;4 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1), ranking among the highest values for BN&#8208;PAHs&#8208;based OFETs. Detailed calculations attribute this significant enhancement in the hole mobility to the marked reduction in reorganization energy (&#955;) of BCNL2, resulting from the five&#8208;membered pyrrole ring annulation and molecular skeleton elongation. This work provides insight into molecular design principles for potential BN&#8208;PAHs in optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous High Current Density and Selective Electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 through Intermediate Balancing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CH4 is promising for carbon neutrality and renewable energy storage but confronts low CH4 selectivity, especially at high current densities. The key challenge lies in promoting *CO intermediate and *H coupling while minimizing side reactions including C&#8208;C coupling or H&#8208;H coupling, which is particularly difficult at high current density due to abundant intermediates. Here we report a cooperative strategy to address this challenge using Cu&#8208;based catalysts comprising Cu&#8208;N coordination polymer and CuO component that can simultaneously manage the key intermediates *CO and *H. A fast CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion rate of 3.14 mmol cm&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 is achieved at 1,300 mA cm&#8722;2 with a Faradaic efficiency of 51.7%. In&#8208;situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations show that the increased Cu&#8208;Cu distance in the Cu&#8208;N coordination polymer component favors multistep *CO hydrogenation over the dimerization, and the CuO component ensures an adequate supply of *H, together contributing to the selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion at high current densities. This work develops a cooperative strategy for the electrosynthesis of CH4 with simultaneous high current density and high selectivity by rational catalyst design, paving the way for its applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring the Reprocessability of Thiol&#8208;Ene Networks through Ring Size effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recycling thermosetting materials presents itself as a major challenge in achieving sustainable material use. Dynamic covalent cross&#8208;linking of polymers has emerged as a viable solution that can combine the structural integrity of thermosetting materials with the (re&#8208;)processability of thermoplastics. Thioether linkages between polymer chains are quite common, and their use dates back to the vulcanization of rubbers. While it is known that thioether bonds can be triggered to exchange through transalkylation reactions, this process is usually slow, as thioether moieties not only have to be activated by an alkylating agent, but the activated thioether also has to associate with a second thioether moiety in a classical SN2&#8208;type process. Here, we present the rational design of dynamic polymer networks based on simple dithiol&#8208;based monomers and a fatty acid derived triene. Two neighboring thioethers can undergo a much faster bond exchange reaction, and we found that the exchange dynamics can be further tuned over almost three orders of magnitude by tailoring the distance between two thioether functionalities. This resulted in thioether&#8208;cross&#8208;linked materials that could be processed by extrusion, a continuous reprocessing technique that was previously not accessible for this class of cross&#8208;linked materials, while still exhibiting appealing creep&#8208;resistance below 70&#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Constraining CO2 Coverage on Copper Promotes CO2 Electroreduction to Multi&#8208;carbon Products in Strong Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2R) to multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products in strong acid presents a promising approach to mitigate the CO2 loss commonly encountered in alkaline and neutral systems. However, this process often suffers from low selectivity for C2+ products due to the competing C1 (e.g., CO and HCOOH) formation and complex C&#8208;C coupling kinetics. In this work, we report a CO2 coverage constraining strategy by diluting CO2 reactant feed to modulate the intermediate distribution and C&#8208;C coupling pathways for an enhanced electrosynthesis of C2+ products in strong acid. Lowering the CO2 feed concentration reduces CO2 coverage on copper catalyst, enriching the surface coverage and optimizing the adsorption configuration of the key CO intermediate for C&#8208;C coupling. This approach efficiently suppresses the formation of undesired C1 products. By employing a 20% CO2 feed, we achieved a significant improvement in C2+ Faradaic efficiency, reaching 68% at 100 mA cm&#8208;2, approximately 1.7 times higher than the 41% obtained using pure CO2. We demonstrated the direct electroreduction of a 30% CO2 feed &#8211; representative CO2 concentration of typical industrial flue gases &#8211; in a full electrolyzer, achieving a C2+ selectivity of 78% and an energy efficiency of 23% at 200 mA cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Isomerism Effect of 3D Dimeric Acceptors for Non&#8208;halogenated Solvent&#8208;Processed Organic Solar Cells with 20% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic photovoltaic materials that can be processed via non&#8208;halogenated solvents are crucial for the large&#8208;area manufacturing of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the limited available of electron acceptors with adequate solubility and favorable molecular packing presents a challenge in achieving efficient non&#8208;halogenated solvent&#8208;processed OSCs. Herein, inspired by the three&#8208;dimensional dimeric acceptor CH8&#8208;4, we employed a molecular isomerization strategy to synthesize its isomers, CH8&#8208;4A and CH8&#8208;4B, by tuning the position of fluorine (F) atom in the central unit. The differing intramolecular fluorine&#8208;sulfur non&#8208;covalent interactions among these isomers led to differences in molecular pre&#8208;aggregation abilities (CH8&#8208;4B &#706; CH8&#8208;4 &#706; CH8&#8208;4A) in o&#8208;xylene (o&#8208;XY) solution, which significantly influence the film&#8208;forming process and the resultant morphological characteristics. Among these, the blend film of CH8&#8208;4, characterized by moderate molecular pre&#8208;aggregation, achieved optimal bi&#8208;continuous donor/acceptor phase separation. Consequently, the o&#8208;xylene processed PM6:CH8&#8208;4 device achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.1%, outperforming that of two other devices. By incorporating L8&#8208;BO&#8208;D as a guest acceptor, we attained an impressive PCE of 20.0% for the CH8&#8208;4&#8208;based ternary device, alongside a high PCE nearing 16% for the mini&#8208;module (13.5 cm2). Our findings underscore the potential of isomerism in 3D dimer acceptors to enhance the performance of eco&#8208;friendly OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving over 20% Efficiency in Laminated HTM&#8208;Free Carbon Electrode Perovskite Solar Cells through In Situ Interface Reconstruction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Laminating a free&#8208;standing carbon electrode film onto perovskite film is a promising method for fabricating HTM (hole transport material)&#8208;free carbon electrode perovskite solar cells (c&#8208;PSCs), offering more flexibility by decoupling the processes of carbon electrode and perovskite layer formation. However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of laminated HTM&#8208;free c&#8208;PSCs (&lt;16.5%) remains lower compared to c&#8208;PSCs with printed carbon pastes (&gt;20%), primarily due to poor interfacial contact between the perovskite and carbon layers. Herein, we report a chemical&#8208;mechanical driven in&#8208;situ interface reconstruction strategy to solve such interface contact issues. The in&#8208;situ interface reconstruction is firstly triggered by methylammonium chloride (MACl) surface treatment to chemically activate the film and then mechanically laminate the carbon electrode onto the softened perovskite film under heating. The perovskite film undergoes in&#8208;situ regrowth and the carbon film starts to cure simultaneously, dynamically reconstructing the perovskite/carbon electrode interface. A tighter and conformal contact is achieved, greatly facilitating the carrier transport and extract. Ultimately, a champion PCE of 20.31% is achieved with enhanced stability. Our in&#8208;situ interface reconstruction strategy which is bombinating the chemical and mechanical process offers a new choice for the further design of low&#8208;cost and efficient HTM&#8208;free c&#8208;PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Repaired Solvation Structure Strategy for High&#8208;Efficiency Phosphate&#8208;Based Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolytes in Potassium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The safety and cycling stability of potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are deeply associated with potassium&#8208;ion electrolytes. However, due to the weak Lewis acidity of potassium ions, localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes in PIBs are prone to excessive weak solvation. Herein, we propose an entropy repair strategy for the solvation structure of potassium ions and systematically design a moderately weakly solvated high&#8208;entropy localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte. The repaired electrolyte can achieve an average stable Coulombic efficiency of 99.4% on the Cu collector surface. The potassium symmetric battery can be stably cycled for over 10000 h under a high current density of 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2 and a large deposition capacity of 1 mAh cm&#8722;2. The potassium metal pouch cell, using K1.92Fe[Fe(CN)6]0.94&#8729;0.5H2O as the cathode, maintains a capacity retention of 87.5% after 2000 cycles at a current density of 0.5 A g&#8722;1. Even when the current density is increased tenfold from 0.1 A g&#8722;1, the battery still retains 67.1% of its capacity. Additionally, due to the introduction of multiple solvents, the potassium metal battery with perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride as the cathode can maintain reversible capacities of 94.0 and 77.3 mAh g&#8722;1 and operate stably at ambient temperatures of &#8722;20 and &#8722;40 &#8451;, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrolyte Anions Suppress Hydrogen Generation in Electrochemical CO Reduction on Cu</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we employed EC&#8208;MS to elucidate the role of halide anions in electrochemical CO2 and CO reduction. We found that the undesired hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was significantly suppressed by the anion used. Specifically, the rates of H2 production decreased in the order KF &gt; KCl &gt; KI, meaning that I&#8722; most strongly suppressed HER. Interestingly, CO reduction products showed an inverse relationship to HER, with KI leading to the highest rate of CO reduction. By pairing our experimental findings with classical molecular dynamics simulations, we propose a mechanism wherein halide anions influence the dynamic interplay between CO reduction and HER by modulating the competition of H* and CO* for active sites on the Cu surface. We propose that this interaction is enabled by the interfacial concentration of K+ being greater in the presence of F&#8722; than in I&#8722;. Our results highlight the need to more broadly consider the properties of ions at electrocatalytic interfaces and they point to thus far underappreciated avenues to optimize hydrocarbon production while suppressing hydrogen evolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Modular Peptide Nanoparticles for Ferroptosis&#8208;Enhanced Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) inhibitors are promising for treating tumors but have limited efficacy due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. In this study, we develop an orchestrated nanoparticle system using modular peptide assemblies, where the co&#8208;assembled sequences are designed for the specific binding to the hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains, guiding the assembly process and enabling the customization of nanoparticle properties. We exploit the modularity of this platform to integrate a hydrophobic ferroptosis precursor, an IDO1 inhibitor, and a hydrophilic peptidic PD&#8208;L1 antagonist for optimizing therapeutic outcomes through ferroptosis&#8208;enhanced tumor immunotherapy. The resulting nanoparticles induce immunogenic ferroptosis, enhance the intratumoral function of T lymphocytes, suppress regulatory T cells, and effectively modulate the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, thereby facilitating regression of tumor growth. This work provides a modular peptide&#8208;based nanoparticle engineering strategy and holds significant potential for advancing cancer treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Acid&#8208;Enhanced Photoiniferter&#160;Polymerization under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoiniferter (PI) is a promising polymerization methodology, often used to overcome restrictions posed by thermal reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer (RAFT) &#160;polymerization. However, in the overwhelming majority of reports, high energy UV irradiation is required to effectively trigger photolysis of RAFT agents and facilitate the polymerization, significantly limiting its potential, scope, and applicability. Although visible light PI has emerged as a highly attractive alternative, most current approaches are limited to the synthesis of lower molecular weight polymers, and typically suffer from prolonged reaction times, extended induction periods, and higher dispersities. Herein, an acid&#8208;enhanced PI RAFT polymerization is introduced that efficiently operates under visible light irradiation. The presence of small amounts of biocompatible citric acid fully eliminates the lengthy induction period by enhancing photolysis, rapidly consumes the CTA, and accelerates the reaction rate, yielding polymers with narrow molar mass distributions, near&#8208;quantitative conversions, and high end&#8208;group fidelity. Ultra&#8208;high&#160; molecular weight polymers can also be synthesized within short timescales without compromising the control over the dispersity (&#208; ~1.1). The versatility of the technique is further demonstrated through the synthesis of well&#8208;defined diblock copolymers and its compatibility to various polymer classes (i.e. acrylamides, acrylates, methacrylates), thus establishing visible&#8208;light PI as a robust tool for polymer synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting C2+ Alcohols Selectivity and Activity in High&#8208;Current CO Electroreduction using Synergistic Cu/Zn Co&#8208;Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To unify the selectivity and activity of CO electroreduction for C2+ alcohols, a Cu/Zn alloy catalyst was developed to balance the competition between CO reduction and hydrogen evolution on Cu sites. Zn alloying increases CO coverage on Cu and facilitates hydrogen spillover from Zn to Cu, synergistically promoting alcohol formation, achieving a 50&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency for alcohol synthesis at a current density of 1.1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The electrosynthesis of multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) alcohols, specifically ethanol and n&#8208;propanol through CO electroreduction (CORR) in H2O, presents a sustainable pathway for intermittent renewable energy storage and a low&#8208;carbon economy. However, achieving high selectivity for alcohol production at industrial current densities is kinetically hampered by side reactions such as ethylene generation and hydrogen evolution reaction, which result from competing adsorption of *CO and *H. In this study, we developed a Cu/Zn alloy catalyst to simultaneously enhance the activity and selectivity for alcohol production by increasing CO capture capacity and enriching active hydrogen on Cu sites. Our findings demonstrate that the Cu/5Zn alloy with a molar ratio of Cu to Zn of 95&#8201;:&#8201;5 exhibits a Faradaic efficiency of 50&#8201;% for the selective electrosynthesis of C2+ alcohols during ampere&#8208;level CO electrolysis. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the Cu/Zn alloy promotes polarized Cu sites, enhancing CO adsorption while facilitating the spillover of hydrogen atoms from Zn to Cu sites, contributing to selective alcohol formation.

         <title>A Highly Biocompatible Polyoxotungstate with Fenton&#8208;like Reaction Activity for Potent Chemodynamic Therapy of Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new polyoxotungstate has been made and found to show excellent solubility, stability, and biocompatibility in aqueous solutions and physiological conditions. Remarkably, it can catalyze the decomposition of H2O2 to generate toxic hydroxyl radicals, and thus exhibit high cytotoxicity and selectivity towards B16&#8208;F10 mouse melanoma cancer cells. Moreover, it exhibits excellent antitumor efficacy with good biosafety against melanoma growth in vivo. This makes it a promising candidate as a cancer chemodynamic therapy agent







Abstract
Integrating Fenton chemistry and nanomedicine into cancer therapy has significantly promoted the development of chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Nanoscale polyoxometalates (POMs), with their reversible redox properties, exhibit promising potential in developing outstanding CDT drugs by exploring their Fenton&#8208;like catalytic reactivity in tumor environments. However, such research is still in its infancy due to the challenges of acquiring POMs that are both easily prepared and possess ideal therapeutic effects, physiological solubility, biocompatibility and safety. In this work, we report the synthesis of a new crystalline antimonotungstate {Dy2Sb2W7O23(OH)(DMF)2(SbW9O33)2} (1, DMF=N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide) with gram&#8208;scale high yield via a facile &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; solvothermal reaction. 1 exhibits not only a soluble and water&#8208;stable POM nanocluster, but also excellent catalytic activity for hydroxyl radical&#8208;generating Fenton&#8208;like reactions. Further biomedical studies reveal that 1 can trigger cell apoptosis and promote lipid peroxidation, exhibiting high cytotoxicity and selectivity towards B16&#8208;F10 mouse melanoma cancer cells with an IC50 value of 4.75&#8197;&#956;M. Especially, 1 can inhibit melanoma growth in vivo with favorable biosafety, achieving a 5.2&#8208;fold reduction in tumor volume and a weight loss of 76.0&#8201;% at the dose of 70&#8197;&#956;g/kg. This research not only demonstrates the immense potential of antimonotungstates in CDT drug development for the first time but also provides new insights and directions for the development of novel anticancer drugs.

High&#8208;Performance Polyimide Covalent Organic Frameworks for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Demonstrating exceptional stability and capacity retention at high current densities, COF&#8208;JLU85 and COF&#8208;JLU86 offer promising advancements in electrode materials for next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies.







Abstract
Organic polymers are considered promising candidates for next&#8208;generation green electrode materials in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, achieving long cycling stability and capacity retention at high current densities remains a significant challenge due to weak structural stability and low conductivity. In this study, we report the synthesis of two novel polyimide covalent organic frameworks (PI&#8208;COFs), COF&#8208;JLU85 and COF&#8208;JLU86, by combining truxenone&#8208;based triamine and linear acid anhydride through polymerization. These PI&#8208;COFs feature layers with pore channels embedded with 18 carbonyl groups, facilitating rapid lithium&#8208;ion diffusion and enhancing structural stability under high current densities. Compared to previously reported organic polymer materials, COF&#8208;JLU86 demonstrates the excellent performance at high current densities, with an impressive specific capacity of 1161.1&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and outstanding cycling stability, retaining 1289.8&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1500 cycles and 401.1&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 15&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 10000 cycles. Additionally, in situ infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide mechanistic insights, revealing that the high concentration of carbonyl redox&#8208;active sites and the optimized electronic structure contribute to the excellent electrochemical performance. These results highlight the potential of PI&#8208;COFs as high&#8208;performance organic electrode materials for LIBs, offering a promising solution to the challenges of long&#8208;term stability and capacity retention at high current densities.

Synthesis of ten non&#8208;ionic fluorosurfactants composed of a polyethylene glycol (PEG) segment bonded to a perfluoropolyether (PFPE) segment of various hydrophilic&#8211;lipophilic balances allowed for identification of minimal interfacial tensions. A perfluorocarbon&#8208;in&#8208;water microdroplet formulation allowed for in vivo mechanical force measurements and increased sensitivity was observed, expanding the relevance of this microdroplet platform.







Abstract
Fluorocarbon oils are uniquely suited for many biomedical applications due to their inert, bioorthogonal properties. In order to interface fluorocarbon oils with biological systems, non&#8208;ionic fluorosurfactants are necessary. However, there is a paucity of non&#8208;ionic fluorosurfactants with low interfacial tension (IFT) to stabilize fluorocarbon phases in aqueous environments (such as oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions). We developed non&#8208;ionic fluorosurfactants composed of a polyethylene glycol (PEG) segment covalently bonded to a flexible perfluoropolyether (PFPE) segment that confer low IFTs between a fluorocarbon oil (HFE&#8208;7700) and water. The synthesis of a panel of surfactants spanning a molecular weight range of 0.64&#8211;66&#8197;kDa with various hydrophilic&#8208;lipophilic balances allowed for identification of minimal IFTs, ranging from 1.4 to 17.8 mN m&#8722;1. The majority of these custom fluorosurfactants display poor solubility in water, allowing their co&#8208;introduction with fluorocarbon oils and minimal leaching. We applied the PEG5PFPE1 surfactant for mechanical force measurements in zebrafish, enabling exceptional sensitivity.

         <title>Supramolecular Crystals based Fast Single Ion Conductor for Long&#8208;Cycling Solid Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn&#8208;based supramolecular crystal (ZMCs) based on succinonitrile were developed with ordered three&#8208;dimensional tunnels for ion conduction and single Zn2+ ion migration feature. Benefiting from the high ionic conductivities and high Zn2+ ion transference number of the solid electrolyte, the as&#8208;fabricated solid Zn battery exhibited high discharge capacity, long&#8208;term cycling stability, wide temperature adaptability and fast charging ability.







Abstract
The solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) used in Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have low ionic conductivity due to the sluggish dynamics of polymer segments. Thus, only short&#8208;range movement of cations is supported, leading to low ionic conductivity and Zn2+ transference (tZn2+). Zn&#8208;based supramolecular crystals (ZMCs) have considerable potential for supporting long&#8208;distance Zn2+ transport; however, their efficiency in ZIBs has not been explored. The present study developed a ZMC consisting of succinonitrile (SN) and zinc bis (trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide (Zn(TFSI)2), with a structural formula identified as Zn(TFSI)2SN3. The ZMC has ordered three&#8208;dimensional tunnels in the crystalline lattices for ion conduction, providing high ionic conductivities (6.02&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C and 3.26&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at &#8722;35&#8201;&#176;C) and a high tZn2+ (0.97). We demonstrated that a Zn&#8214;Zn symmetrical battery with ZMCs has long&#8208;term cycling stability (1200&#8197;h) and a dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping process, even at a high plating areal density of 3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The as&#8208;fabricated solid&#8208;state Zn battery exhibited excellent performance, including high discharge capacity (1.52&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2), long&#8208;term cycling stability (83.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 70000&#8197;cycles (7&#8197;months)), wide temperature adaptability (&#8722;35 to 50&#8201;&#176;C) and fast charging ability. The ZMC differs from SPEs in its structure for transporting Zn2+ ions, significantly improving solid&#8208;state ZIBs while maintaining safety, durability, and sustainability.

         <title>Programmable Circular Multivalent Nanobody&#8208;Targeting Chimeras (mNbTACs) for Multireceptor&#8208;Mediated Protein Degradation and Targeted Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multivalent nanobody&#8208;targeting chimeras (mNbTACs) have been developed by encoding diverse nanobody codons on a circular template using DNA printing technology. These chimeras enable targeted membrane protein degradation and drug delivery for cancer combination immunotherapy through multireceptor&#8208;mediated recognition and endocytosis, providing a versatile tool for personalized disease treatment.







Abstract
Multispecific therapeutics hold significant promise in drug delivery, protein degradation, and cell recruitment to address clinical issues of tumor heterogeneity, resistance, and immune evasion. However, their modular engineering remains challenging. We developed a targeted degradation platform, termed multivalent nanobody&#8208;targeting chimeras (mNbTACs), by encoding diverse nanobody codons on a circular template using DNA printing technology. The homo&#8208; or hetero&#8208; mNbTACs specifically recognized membrane targets in a multivalent manner and simultaneously recruited scavenger receptors to favor clathrin&#8208;/caveolae&#8208;dependent endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of multiple proteins with high efficiency and selectivity. We demonstrated that a bispecific doxorubicin&#8208;loaded mNbTAC, named Doxo&#8208;mvNbsPPH, passively accumulated at tumor sites, specifically interacted with PD&#8722;L1 and HER2 targets, and was rapidly transported into lysosome, inducing potent immunogenic cell death and alleviating immune checkpoint evasion. The synergistic boosting of innate and adaptive immunity promoted the infiltration and proliferation of CD8+ T cells in tumor microenvironment (an 11&#8208;fold increase) with high toxicity and low exhaustion, eventually enhancing antitumor efficacy. Our mNbTAC platform provides multispecific therapeutics with variable valences and programmed species, whereas it induces targeted protein degradation through multireceptor&#8208;mediated endocytosis and lysosomal degradation without the need for lysosome&#8208;targeting receptors, representing a general and modular tool to harness extracellular proteome for disease treatment.

         <title>A Site&#8208;Specific Click Chemistry Approach to Di&#8208;Ubiquitylate H1 Variants Reveals Position&#8208;Dependent Stimulation of the DNA Repair Protein RNF168</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a click chemistry approach to di&#8208;ubiquitylate histone H1 at relevant DNA repair&#8208;associated positions (H1KxUb2) to probe its effect on the E3 ligase RNF168. We demonstrate that H1KxUb2 stimulate RNF168 activity in vitro depending on the Ub2N3 attachment site on H1. Moreover, we show that H1K17Ub2 can recruit RNF168 to chromatin in cells, underlining the hypothesis that poly&#8208;ubiquitylated H1 directs RNF168 to DNA damaged sites.







Abstract
Ubiquitylation of histone H2A at lysines 13 and 15 by the E3 ligase RNF168 plays a key role in orchestrating DNA double&#8208;strand break (DSB) repair, which is often deregulated in cancer. RNF168 activity is triggered by DSB signaling cascades, reportedly through K63&#8208;linked poly&#8208;ubiquitylation of linker histone H1. However, direct experimental evidence of this mechanism has been elusive, primarily due to the lack of methods to specifically poly&#8208;ubiquitylate H1. Here, we developed a versatile click chemistry approach to covalently link multiple proteins in a site&#8208;specific, controlled, and stepwise manner. Applying this method, we synthesized H1 constructs bearing triazole&#8208;linked di&#8208;ubiquitin on four DNA repair&#8208;associated ubiquitylation hotspots (H1KxUb2, at K17, 46, 64 and 96). Integrated into nucleosome arrays, the H1KxUb2 variants stimulated H2A ubiquitylation by RNF168 in a position&#8208;dependent manner, with H1K17Ub2 showing the strongest RNF168 activation effect. Moreover, we show that di&#8208;ubiquitin binding is the driving force underlying RNF168 recruitment, introducing H1K17Ub2 into living U&#8208;2 OS cells. Together, our results support the hypothesis of poly&#8208;ubiquitylated H1 guiding RNF168 recruitment to DSB sites. Moreover, we demonstrate how the streamlined synthesis of H1KxUb2 variants enables mechanistic studies into RNF168 regulation, with potential implications for its inhibition in susceptible cancers.

         <title>The Acetylene Bridge in Intramolecular Singlet Fission: A Boon or A Nuisance?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>

Acetylene bridges provide a mechanism to promote spin evolution within the triplet pair to achieve free triplets but also offers new parasitic pathways for triplet&#8208;pair recombination, revealing to be both a boon and a nuisance.







Abstract
Various analogues of the alkylsilylacetylene group are frequently used as auxiliary groups to enhance the solubility and stability of the acene dimer core, widely used as platforms to investigate intramolecular singlet fission (iSF) mechanisms. However, while in the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;linked dimers they are primarily auxiliary groups, these are essential fragments of the bridging units in 6,6&#8217;/5,5&#8217;&#8208;linked dimers, the two preferred choices for dimerization. The starkly different iSF dynamics observed in the two variants raise the question of what role the acetylene bridges play. Here, we systematically designed a set of (oligo&#8722;)para&#8208;phenylene bridged 2,2&#8217;&#8208;linked pentacene dimers with an additional acetylene fragment in the bridging unit to mimic the structure of 6,6&#8217;&#8208;linked dimers. Contrasting the results with previously reported analogous 2,2&#8217;&#8208;linked and 6,6&#8217;&#8208;linked pentacene dimers reveals that the acetylene bridges contribute to significant conformational freedom. This effect provides a mechanism to promote spin evolution within the triplet pair to achieve free triplets but also offers new parasitic pathways for triplet&#8208;pair recombination, revealing that this structural motif can be both a boon and a nuisance. Additionally, our analysis reveals that these bridges directly modify the electronic states, highlighting significant pitfalls of the standard chromophore&#8208;bridge&#8208;chromophore framework used to design and interpret photophysics of iSF materials.

         <title>A Proteomics Pipeline for Generating Clinical Grade Biomarker Candidates from Data&#8208;Independent Acquisition Mass Spectrometry (DIA&#8208;MS) Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based biomarker discovery holds immense promise. We have identified an exciting new path forward by incorporating stringent validation criteria into the analysis of high&#8208;quality MS&#8208;based discovery data. This approach facilitates a more straightforward and robust selection of peptide analytes suitable for translation into biomarkers. We applied our methods to plasma samples obtained from an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) cohort (n=492).







Abstract
Clinical biomarker development has been stymied by inaccurate protein quantification from mass spectrometry (MS) discovery data and a prolonged validation process. To mitigate these issues, we created the Targeted Extraction Assessment of Quantification (TEAQ) software package that uses data&#8208;independent acquisition analysis from a discovery cohort to select precursors, peptides, and proteins that adhere to analytical criteria required for established targeted assays. TEAQ was applied to DIA&#8208;MS data from plasma samples acquired on a new high resolution accurate mass (HRAM) mass spectrometry platform where precursors were evaluated for linearity, specificity, repeatability, reproducibility, and intra&#8208;protein correlation based on 8&#8208; or 11&#8208;point loading curves at three throughputs. This data can be used as a general resource for developing other targeted assays. TEAQ analysis of data from a case and control cohort for inflammatory bowel disease (n=492) identified 1110 signature peptides for 326 quantifiable proteins from the 1179 identified proteins. Applying TEAQ analysis to discovery data will streamline targeted assay development and the transition to validation and clinical studies.

         <title>Luminescence Modulation in Boron&#8208;Cluster&#8208;Based Luminogens via Boron Isotope Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study unveils, for the first time, how the boron isotope effects shape the photophysical properties of boron cluster&#8208;based luminogens. In comparison to 10B, 11B enables to enhance luminous efficiency (the heavier, the brighter), reduce full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (the heavier, the narrower), and extend luminescence lifetime (the heavier, the longer).







Abstract
Recent advances in luminescent materials highlight the significant impact of hydrogen isotope effects on improving optoelectronic properties. However, the research on the influence of the boron isotope effects on photophysical properties remains underdeveloped. This study focused on exploring the boron isotope effects in boron&#8208;cluster&#8208;based luminogens. In doing so, we designed and synthesized carborane&#8208;based luminogens containing 98&#8201;% 10B and 95&#8201;% 11B, respectively, and observed distinct photophysical behaviors. Compared to the 10B&#8208;enriched luminogens, the 11B&#8208;enriched counterparts can significantly enhance luminescence efficiency, prolong emission lifetime, and reduce full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum. Additionally, increased thermal stability, redshifted B&#8722;H vibrations, and a fourfold enhanced electrochemiluminescence intensity have also been observed. On the other hand, the biological assessments of a 10B&#8208;enriched luminogen reveals low cytotoxicity, high boron uptake, and excellent fluorescence imaging capability, indicating the potential application in boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). This work presents the first comprehensive exploration on the boron isotope effects in boron clusters, and provides valuable insights into the rational design of organic luminogens for advanced optoelectronic and biomedical applications.

         <title>High Efficiency Alkaline Iodine Batteries with Multi&#8208;Electron Transfer Enabled by Bi/Bi2O3 Redox Mediator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By shifting from an acidic to an alkaline electrolyte, the IO3&#8722; formation kinetics could be significantly enhanced due to the spontaneous disproportionation reaction between I2 and OH&#8722; ions. The sluggish kinetics of IO3&#8722; reduction can be improved by introducing Bi/Bi2O3 as a redox mediator (RM). Benefiting from reduced voltage polarization and improved reaction kinetics, the alkaline iodine full battery with I&#8722;/IO3&#8722; conversion on Bi/Bi2O3 RM cathode delivers a higher areal capacity and a better cycle performance.







Abstract
The multi&#8208;electron transfer I&#8722;/IO3&#8722; redox couple is attractive for high energy aqueous batteries. Shifting from an acidic to an alkaline electrolyte significantly enhances the IO3&#8722; formation kinetics due to the spontaneous disproportionation reaction, while the alkaline environment also offers more favorable Zn anode compatibility. However, sluggish kinetics during the reduction of IO3&#8722; persists in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes, compromising the energy efficiency of this glorious redox couple. Here, we establish the fundamental redox mechanism of the I&#8722;/IO3&#8722; couple in alkaline electrolytes for the first time and propose that Bi/Bi2O3 acts as a redox mediator (RM) to &#8220;catalyze&#8221; the reduction of IO3&#8722;. This mediation significantly reduces the voltage gap between charge/discharge from 1.6&#8197;V to 1&#8197;V with improved conversion efficiency and rate capability. By pairing the Zn anode and the Bi/Bi2O3 RM cathode, the full battery with I&#8722;/IO3&#8722; redox mechanism achieves high areal capacity of 12&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and stable operation at 5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for over 400 cycles.

         <title>Boosting Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Kinetics through Interfacial Environments Induced Surface Migration of Adsorbed Hydroxyl</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beyond the bifunctional mechanism limited to the neighboring sites, the surface migration of OHad species from the positively charged Ni3C to the negatively charged Ni across the Ni3C&#8722;Ni interface was revealed. This was induced by the discrepancy between the local surface charge densities and interfacial environments on the Ni3C and Ni components under operating conditions, leading to accelerated alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) kinetics.







Abstract
Constructing bifunctional sites through heterojunction engineering to accelerate water formation has become a pivotal strategy to improve the alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) kinetics, which is mainly focused on the synergistic effect of neighboring sites and the energetics of the surface reaction steps. However, the roles of the surface migration of key intermediates that go beyond the bifunctional mechanism limited to neighboring atoms have usually been ignored. Using the heterostructured Ni3C&#8722;Ni catalyst as a model, we found that the rapid surface migration of OHad species from the positively charged Ni3C to the negatively charged Ni component played a decisive role in facilitating water formation. Such unprecedented surface migration of OHad is induced by the large discrepancy between the local surface charge densities and interfacial environments of the Ni3C and Ni components under operating conditions. Benefiting from this, the resultant Ni3C&#8722;Ni exhibited outstanding mass activity for the alkaline HOR, which was approximately 19&#8208;fold and 21&#8208;fold higher than those of Ni and Ni3C, respectively. These findings not only provide novel insights into the alkaline HOR mechanism of heterostructured catalysts but also open new avenues for developing advanced electrocatalysts for alkaline fuel cells.

         <title>Spatially Controlled DNA Frameworks for Sensitive Detection and Specific Isolation of Tumor Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the programmability and rigid features of the DNA framework, the DNA triangular prisms are connected to form hand&#8208;in&#8208;hand multivalent DNA triangular prism structures (Zy1&#8208;MTP) to achieve high affinity, signal intensity for sensitive detection of tumor cells. The DNA nanostructures can be also served as bridges between target cells and magnetic beads, resulting efficient isolation in whole blood.







Abstract
High&#8208;affinity, specific, and sensitive probes are crucial for the specific recognition and identification of tumor cells from complex matrices. Multivalent binding is a powerful strategy, but the irrational spatial distribution of the functional moieties may reduce the probe performance. Here, we constructed a Janus DNA triangular prism nanostructure (3Zy1&#8208;JTP&#8208;3) for sensitive detection and specific isolation of tumor cells. Benefiting from spatial features of the triangular prism, the fluorescence intensity induced by 3Zy1&#8208;JTP&#8208;3 was almost 4 times that of the monovalent structure. Moreover, the DNA triangular prisms were connected to form hand&#8208;in&#8208;hand multivalent DNA triangular prism structures (Zy1&#8208;MTP), in which the fluorescence intensity and affinity were increased to 9&#8208;fold and 10&#8208;fold of 3Zy1&#8208;JTP&#8208;3, respectively. Furthermore, 3Zy1&#8208;JTP&#8208;3 and Zy1&#8208;MTP were combined with magnetic beads, and the latter showed higher capture efficiency (&gt;90&#8201;%) in whole blood. This work provides a new strategy for the efficient capture of rare cells in complex biological samples.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Activatable Copper Nanoplatforms Synergize with the 5&#8208;Azacytidine Prodrug to Potentiate Cuproptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;delivery of the NIR&#8208;II photosensitizer H7&#8208;Cu&#8208;BPE and the ROS&#8208;responsive copper ionophore DTC&#8208;BA enables targeted activation of cuproptosis in oral carcinoma. Upon 808&#8197;nm irradiation, DTC chelates Cu2+ from H7&#8208;Cu&#8208;BPE to form Cu(DTC)2, which is reduced by endogenous FDX1 to produce Cu+ and promote cuproptosis. The addition of 5&#8208;Azacytidine further replenished cellular FDX1, sustaining cuproptosis and enhancing both tumor suppression and antitumor immunity.







Abstract
Cuproptosis, a newly discovered cell death modality, is gaining recognition for its crucial role in antitumor therapy. Here, we demonstrated that Ferredoxin 1 (FDX1), a key gene involved in cuproptosis, is negatively correlated with malignancy and T&#8208;cell exhaustion in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Based on these findings, we developed near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;controlled nanoparticles (NPs), CuD@PM, which can selectively deliver copper to HNSCC cells and induce cuproptosis in the presence of microneedles loaded with triacetylated azacitidine (TAc&#8208;AzaC) and 808&#8197;nm laser irradiation. Intravenous administration of these NPs significantly suppressed tumor growth in HNSCC animal models and enhanced the antitumor immune response. The NIR&#8208;controlled activation of cuproptosis offers great potential as a safe, targeted, and image&#8208;guided antitumor therapy for HNSCC.

         <title>Heterogeneous Carbonylation of Alcohols on Charge&#8208;Density&#8208;Distinct Mo&#8722;Ni Dual Sites Localized at Edge Sulfur Vacancies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong and weak adsorption and activation of CH3OH and CO were realized on charge&#8208;density&#8208;distinct Mo&#8722;Ni dual sites localized at edge sulfur vacancies of Ni@MoS2, boosting the direct gas phase heterogeneous carbonylation of alcohols.







Abstract
Alcohols carbonylation is of great importance in industry but remains a challenge to abandon the usage of the halide additives and noble metals. Here we report the realization of direct alcohols heterogeneous carbonylation to carbonyl&#8208;containing chemicals, especially in methanol carbonylation, with a remarkable space&#8208;time&#8208;yield (STY) of 4.74 molacetyl/kgcat./h and a durable stability as long as 100&#8197;h on Ni@MoS2 catalyst. Mechanistic analysis reveals that the Mo&#8722;Ni dual sites localized at edge sulfur vacancies of Ni@MoS2 exhibit distinct charge density, which strongly activate CH3OH to break its C&#8722;O bond and non&#8208;dissociatively activate CO. Density functional theory calculations further suggest that the low charge density in Mo&#8722;Ni, the Ni site, could significantly lower the barrier for CO migration and nucleophilic attack of methoxy species, and finally leads to the rapid formation of acetyl products. Ni@MoS2 catalyst could also effectively realize the carbonylation of ethanol, n&#8208;propanol and n&#8208;butanol to their acyl products, which may demonstrate its universal application for alcohols carbonylation.

         <title>An Efficient CRISPR/Cas Cooperative Shearing Platform for Clinical Diagnostics Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CRISPR/Cas cooperative shearing system that is capable of the most sensitive unamplified electrochemical assay of nucleic acids up to date. Two CRISPR/Cas&#8208;crRNA duplexes simultaneously target different sites of the sequence, increasing recognition possibility and shearing efficiency compared with traditional CRISPR/Cas systems.







Abstract
The CRISPR/Cas system is a powerful genome editing tool and possesses widespread applications in molecular diagnostics, therapeutics and genetic engineering. But easy folding of the target sequences causes remarkable deterioration of the recognition and shear efficiency in the case of single Cas&#8208;CRISPR RNA (crRNA) duplex. Here, we develop a CRISPR/Cas cooperative shearing (CRISPR&#8208;CS) system. Compared with traditional CRISPR/Cas system, two CRISPR/Cas&#8208;crRNA duplexes simultaneously recognize different sites in the target sequence, increasing recognition possibility and shearing efficiency. Cooperative shearing cuts more methylene blue&#8208;ssDNA reporters on the electrode, enabling unamplified nucleic acid electrochemical assay in less than 5&#8197;minutes with a detection limit of 9.5&#215;10&#8722;20&#8197;M, 2 to 9 orders of magnitude lower than those of other electrochemical assays.

&lt;p&gt;A CRISPR/Cas cooperative shearing system that is capable of the most sensitive unamplified electrochemical assay of nucleic acids up to date. Two CRISPR/Cas-crRNA duplexes simultaneously target different sites of the sequence, increasing recognition possibility and shearing efficiency compared with traditional CRISPR/Cas systems.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CRISPR/Cas system is a powerful genome editing tool and possesses widespread applications in molecular diagnostics, therapeutics and genetic engineering. But easy folding of the target sequences causes remarkable deterioration of the recognition and shear efficiency in the case of single Cas-CRISPR RNA (crRNA) duplex. Here, we develop a CRISPR/Cas cooperative shearing (CRISPR-CS) system. Compared with traditional CRISPR/Cas system, two CRISPR/Cas-crRNA duplexes simultaneously recognize different sites in the target sequence, increasing recognition possibility and shearing efficiency. Cooperative shearing cuts more methylene blue-ssDNA reporters on the electrode, enabling unamplified nucleic acid electrochemical assay in less than 5&#8197;minutes with a detection limit of 9.5&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;20&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M, 2 to 9 orders of magnitude lower than those of other electrochemical assays. The CRISPR-CS platform detects monkeypox, human papilloma virus and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with an accuracy up to 98.1&#8201;%, demonstrating the potential application of the efficient cooperative shearing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic Adaptation of Active Site Driven by Dual&#8208;side Adsorption in Single&#8208;Atomic Catalysts During CO2 Electroreduction</title>

CO2 reduction reaction mechanisms (CO2RR) on (Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C) Single&#8208;Atomic Catalysts (SACs). The reaction can take on both sides of the metal active centers leading to many different reaction pathways. Each adsorbed intermediate could change the electronic structure of the active site and dynamically assemble into a new catalyst.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom iron embedded in N&#8208;doped carbon (Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C) is among the most representative single&#8208;atomic catalysts (SACs) for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Despite the simplicity of the active site, the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO mechanism on Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C remains controversial. Firstly, there is a long debate regarding the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) of the reactions. Secondly, recent computational and experimental studies are puzzled by the fact that the CO&#8208;poisoned Fe centers still remain highly active at high potentials. Thirdly, there are ongoing challenges in elucidating the high selectivity of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) over CO2RR at high potentials. In this work, we introduce a novel CO2RR mechanism on Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C, which was inspired by the dynamic of active sites in biological systems. By employing grand&#8208;canonical density functional theory and kinetic Monte&#8208;Carlo, we found that the RDS is not fixed but changes with the applied potential. We demonstrated that our proposed dual&#8208;side mechanisms could clarify the reason behind the high catalytic activity of CO&#8208;poisoned metal centers, as well as the high selectivity of HER over CO2RR at high potential. This study provides a fundamental explanation for long&#8208;standing puzzles of an important catalyst and calls for the importance of considering the dynamic of active sites in reaction mechanisms.

         <title>Unveiling the Dual Role of Oxophilic Cr4+ in Cr&#8722;Cu2O Nanosheet Arrays for Enhanced Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>

The oxophilic Cr4+ was introduced into Cu2O nanosheet arrays, featuring a paramount Cr4+&#8722;O&#8722;Cu+ structure to protect the Cu+ species and accelerate water dissociation for synergistically electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate to ammonia.







Abstract
Cuprous oxide (Cu2O)&#8208;based catalysts present a promising activity for the electrochemical nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction to ammonia (eNO3RA), but the electrochemical instability of Cu+ species may lead to an unsatisfactory durability, hindering the exploration of the structure&#8208;performance relationship. Herein, we propose an efficient strategy to stabilize Cu+ through the incorporation of Cr4+ into the Cu2O matrix to construct a Cr4+&#8722;O&#8722;Cu+ network structure. In situ and quasi&#8208;in&#8197;situ characterizations reveal that the Cu+ species are well maintained via the strong Cr4+&#8722;O&#8722;Cu+ interaction that inhibits the leaching of lattice oxygen. Importantly, in&#8197;situ generated Cr3+&#8722;O&#8722;Cu+ from Cr4+&#8722;O&#8722;Cu+ is identified as a dual&#8208;active site for eNO3RA, wherein the Cu+ sites are responsible for the activation of N&#8208;containing intermediates, while the assisting Cr3+ centers serve as the electron&#8208;proton mediators for rapid water dissociation. Theoretical investigations further demonstrated that the metastable state Cr3+&#8722;O&#8722;Cu+ favors the conversion from the endoergic hydrogenation of the key *ON intermediate to an exoergic reaction in an ONH pathway, and facilitates the subsequent NH3 desorption with a low energy barrier. The superior eNO3RA with a maximum 91.6&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency could also be coupled with anodic sulfion oxidation to achieve concurrent NH3 production and sulfur recovery with reduced energy input.

         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a star&#8208;shaped polyarene formed by 19 cata&#8208;fused benzene rings distributed within three hexacene branches is described. This molecule, which is the largest starphene that has been obtained to date, was prepared by combining in&#8208;solution and on&#8208;surface chemistry. [19]Starphene was characterized by high&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) showing a remarkable small HOMO&#8208;LUMO transport gap (0.9&#8197;eV).







Abstract
Starphenes are structurally appealing three&#8208;fold symmetric polycyclic aromatic compounds with potential interesting applications in molecular electronics and nanotechnology. This family of star&#8208;shaped polyarenes can be regarded as three acenes that are connected through a single benzene ring. In fact, just like acenes, unsubstituted large starphenes are poorly soluble and highly reactive molecules under ambient conditions making their synthesis difficult to achieve. Herein, we report two different synthetic strategies to obtain a starphene formed by 19 cata&#8208;fused benzene rings distributed within three hexacene branches. This molecule, which is the largest starphene that has been obtained to date, was prepared by combining solution&#8208;phase and on&#8208;surface synthesis.

Abstract
Reductive proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) has important energetic implications in numerous synthetic and natural redox processes. The development of catalytic systems that can mediate such transformations has become an attractive target, especially when light is used to generate the reactive species towards solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemicals conversion. However, such approach becomes challenged by kinetic competition with H2 evolution. Here we describe the excited state reactivity of a molecular Zr&#8208;based platform under visible light irradiation for the efficient reduction of multiple bonds. Mechanistic investigations shine light on a charge separation process that colocalizes an excited electron and an acidic proton to promote selective PCET. We further leveraged this reactivity for the photocatalytic reduction of a variety of organic substrates. Our results demonstrate the promise of this molecular platform to design strong photocatalytic PCET mediators for reductive transformations. More broadly, we also show the potential relevance of PCET mechanisms in the (photo)redox chemistry of Zr&#8208;based molecular materials.

The development of catalytic systems that can mediate such transformations has become an attractive target, especially when light is used to generate the reactive species towards solar-to-chemicals conversion. However, such approach becomes challenged by kinetic competition with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution. Here we describe the excited state reactivity of a molecular Zr-based platform under visible light irradiation for the efficient reduction of multiple bonds. Mechanistic investigations shine light on a charge separation process that colocalizes an excited electron and an acidic proton to promote selective PCET. We further leveraged this reactivity for the photocatalytic reduction of a variety of organic substrates. Our results demonstrate the promise of this molecular platform to design strong photocatalytic PCET mediators for reductive transformations. More broadly, we also show the potential relevance of PCET mechanisms in the (photo)redox chemistry of Zr-based molecular materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hemilabile and Redox&#8208;Active Quinone Ligands Unlock sp3&#8208;Rich Couplings in Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Olefin Carbosulfenylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The redox&#8208;active quinone ligand enables seamless oxidation state manipulation between Ni(I) and Ni(II) intermediates, which facilitates the migratory insertion step. Meanwhile, the L&#8208;type lone&#8208;pair coordination promotes oxidative addition at a relatively more electron&#8208;rich Ni(I) center. These mechanistic discoveries enable the installation of alkylsulfenyl (&#8211;SAlkyl) groups in a series of 1,2&#8208;carbosulfenylation reactions of unactivated alkenes.







Abstract
A three&#8208;component coupling approach toward structurally complex dialkylsulfides is described via the nickel&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;carbosulfenylation of unactivated alkenes with organoboron nucleophiles and alkylsulfenamide (N&#8722;S) electrophiles. Efficient catalytic turnover is facilitated using a tailored N&#8722;S electrophile containing an N&#8208;methyl methanesulfonamide leaving group, allowing catalyst loadings as low as 1&#8197;mol&#8201;%. Regioselectivity is controlled by a collection of monodentate, weakly coordinating native directing groups, including sulfonamides, amides, sulfinamides, phosphoramides, and carbamates. Key to the development of this transformation is the identification of quinones as a family of hemilabile and redox&#8208;active ligands that tune the steric and electronic properties of the metal throughout the catalytic cycle. Density functional theory (DFT) results show that the duroquinone (DQ) ligand adopts different coordination modes in different stages of the Ni&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;carbosulfenylation&#8208;binding as an &#951;6 capping ligand to stabilize the precatalyst/resting state and prevent catalyst decomposition, binding as an X&#8208;type redox&#8208;active durosemiquinone radical anion to promote alkene migratory insertion with a less distorted square planar Ni(II) center, and binding as an L&#8208;type ligand to promote N&#8722;S oxidative addition at a relatively more electron&#8208;rich Ni(I) center.

         <title>Li2MoO4 Tailored Anion&#8208;enhanced Solvation Sheath Layer Promotes Solution&#8208;phase Mediated Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of strategies to inhibit the shuttle effect of redox mediator can effectively reduce the high overpotential and prolong the cycle stability of Li&#8208;O2 batteries. In this manuscript, Li2MoO4 was introduced to LiBr&#8208;containing electrolyte to modify the Li+ solvation structure and forms an anion&#8208;rich derived protective solid electrolyte interphase on Li anode. Additionally, the dispersed Li2MoO4 promotes the O2 conversion in solution phase and inhibits the shuttle effect of Br&#8208;related species via adsorption capabilities. This work opens new avenues for the sustainable development and practical application of such battery systems.







Abstract
The high overpotential of Li&#8208;O2 batteries (LOBs) is primarily triggered by sluggish charge transfer kinetics at the reaction interfaces. A typical LiBr redox mediator (RM) catalyst can effectively reduce the battery's overpotential. However, it is prone to shuttling and corroding the Li anode, leading to RM loss and reduced energy efficiency. To address these challenges, we introduced Li2MoO4 into the LiBr&#8208;containing electrolyte to promote the solution&#8208;phase mediated LOBs. This addition tailors the anion&#8208;enhanced Li+ solvation sheath layer and forms a robust anion&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interphases (SEI) on the Li anode. The robust SEI effectively mitigates the corrosion of soluble Br3&#8722;/Br2 and attacks by highly reactive oxygen species. Additionally, the dispersed and high&#8208;density Li2MoO4 exhibits strong adsorption capabilities for O2/LiO2 and Br&#8208;related species during the discharge/charge process, thereby promoting the growth and decomposition of Li2O2 in the solution phase and inhibiting the shuttle effect of Br&#8208;related species in LOBs. Consequently, the LOBs demonstrate exceptional cycling stability (415 cycles) and high energy efficiency (86.2&#8201;%), paving the way for the sustainable development and practical application of these battery systems.

         <title>Thermally&#8208;Stable Single&#8208;Site Pd on CeO2 Catalyst for Selective Amination of Phenols to Aromatic Amines without External Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel/universal aerosolizing&#8208;pyrolysis strategy was developed for constructing high&#8208;loading single&#8208;site catalysts with excellent thermal durability. Single&#8208;site Pd1/CeO2 catalyst achieved excellent selectivity for important aromatic amines from amination of phenols without external hydrogen, while Pd nano&#8208;catalysts mainly gave phenyl&#8208;ring&#8208;saturation products. The outstanding properties of the former were attributed to high&#8208;loading Pd1/CeO2 with abundant defect sites and suitable acid&#8208;base properties.







Abstract
Developing a new route to produce aromatic amines as key chemicals from renewable phenols is a benign alternative to current fossil&#8208;based routes like nitroaromatic hydrogenation, but is challenging because of the high dissociation energy of the Ar&#8722;OH bond and difficulty in controlling side reactions. Herein, an aerosolizing&#8208;pyrolysis strategy was developed to prepare high&#8208;density single&#8208;site cationic Pd species immobilized on CeO2 (Pd1/CeO2) with excellent sintering resistance. The obtained Pd1/CeO2 catalysts achieved remarkable selectivity of important aromatic amines (yield up to 76.2&#8201;%) in the phenols amination with amines without external hydrogen sources, while Pd nano&#8208;catalysts mainly afforded phenyl&#8208;ring&#8208;saturation products. The excellent catalytic properties of the Pd1/CeO2 are closely related to high&#8208;loading Pd single&#8208;site catalysts with abundant surface defect sites and suitable acid&#8208;base properties. This report provides a sustainable route for producing aromatic amines from renewable feedstocks.

         <title>Monofluorinated Phosphate with Unique P&#8722;F Bond for Nonflammable and Long&#8208;Life Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel monofluorinated phosphate co&#8208;solvent, diethyl fluoridophosphate (DEFP), is developed. Unlike traditional C&#8722;F bond fluorination strategies, the P&#8722;F bond can effectively reduce the charge density on the oxygen atom of the P=O bond and lower the LUMO level of DEFP, achieving a unique balance between safety and electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) with conventional carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes suffer from safety concerns in large&#8208;scale applications. Phosphates feature high flame retardancy but are incompatible with graphite anode due to their inability to form a passivated solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, we report a monofluorinated co&#8208;solvent, diethyl fluoridophosphate (DEFP), featuring a unique P&#8722;F bond that allows a trade&#8208;off between safety and electrochemical performance in LIBs. The P&#8722;F bond in DEFP weakens ion&#8208;dipole interactions with Li+ ions, lowering the desolvation barrier, and simultaneously reduces the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of DEFP, promoting the formation of a robust and inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. Additionally, DEFP exhibits improved thermal stability due to both robust SEI and the inherent flame&#8208;retardant properties of the P&#8722;F bond. Consequently, the optimized DEFP&#8208;based electrolyte exhibits improved cyclability and rate capacity in LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2||graphite full cells compared with triethyl phosphate&#8208;based electrolytes and commercial carbonate electrolytes. Even at a low E/C ratio of 3.45&#8197;g&#8201;Ah&#8722;1, the 1.16 Ah NCM811||Gr pouch cells achieve a high capacity retention of 94.2&#8201;% after 200&#8197;cycles. This work provides a promising approach to decouple phosphate safety and graphite compatibility, paving the way for safer and high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with conventional carbonate-based electrolytes suffer from safety concerns in large-scale applications. Phosphates feature high flame retardancy but are incompatible with graphite anode due to their inability to form a passivated solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, we report a monofluorinated co-solvent, diethyl fluoridophosphate (DEFP), featuring a unique P&#8722;F bond that allows a trade-off between safety and electrochemical performance in LIBs. The P&#8722;F bond in DEFP weakens ion-dipole interactions with Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, lowering the desolvation barrier, and simultaneously reduces the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of DEFP, promoting the formation of a robust and inorganic-rich SEI. Additionally, DEFP exhibits improved thermal stability due to both robust SEI and the inherent flame-retardant properties of the P&#8722;F bond. Consequently, the optimized DEFP-based electrolyte exhibits improved cyclability and rate capacity in LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;||graphite full cells compared with triethyl phosphate-based electrolytes and commercial carbonate electrolytes. Even at a low E/C ratio of 3.45&#8197;g&#8201;Ah&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, the 1.16 Ah NCM811||Gr pouch cells achieve a high capacity retention of 94.2&#8201;% after 200&#8197;cycles. This work provides a promising approach to decouple phosphate safety and graphite compatibility, paving the way for safer and high-performance lithium-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed [3+2] annulation of Aromatic Amides with Olefins via Iminium Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We realized the first radical&#8208;type [3+2] annulation of aromatic amides with olefins via stepwise radical process, which is different from previous examples of acyl radicals to olefins. Electrophilic activation with Tf2O was employed to overcome the challenge of excessively low reduction peak potential of amides and therefore the unprecedented iminium radicals were readily generated under our photoredox reaction conditions.







Abstract
Despite the preliminary success of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] annulation of amides with olefins, the corresponding radical&#8208;type [3+2] annulation remains a laborious challenge. Herein we report the first photoredox&#8208;catalyzed radical&#8208;type [3+2] annulation of aromatic amides with olefins. We established an approach to generate unprecedented iminium radicals by reducing the oxyiminium intermediates, formed in situ from corresponding amides with Tf2O, via photoredox catalysis. The [3+2] annulation was achieved via stepwise radical process, instead of forming linear products via other pathways as previously reported. This annulation protocol exhibits excellent functional group tolerance, and a diversity of substrates are united under the photoredox conditions, affording iminium products that can be in situ diversified into 1&#8208;indanones, enamines and amines. Mechanistic investigations indicate reduction of the oxyiminium intermediate to the iminium radicals by excited&#8208;state of the photocatalyst initiates the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Directional Electron Transfer in Enzymatic Nano&#8208;Bio Hybrids for Selective Photobiocatalytic Conversion of Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nano&#8208;bio hybrid, which integrates photosensitive semiconductor with nitrogen conversion enzyme, can regulate the pathway of nitrate conversion at the enzymatic level and switch the product from inert N2 to usable nitrite with an unprecedented selectivity of up to 95.3&#8201;% through efficient and selective photogenerated electron transfer at the biotic&#8208;abiotic interface nano&#8208;bio interface, paving an appealing way for the sustainable treatment and utilization of nitrate.







Abstract
Semi&#8208;artificial photosynthetic system (SAPS) that combines enzymes or cellular organisms with light&#8208;absorbing semiconductors, has emerged as an attractive approach for nitrogen conversion, yet faces the challenge of reaction pathway regulation. Herein, we find that photoelectrons can transfer from the &#8722;C&#8801;N groups at the edge of cyano&#8208;rich carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;CN) to nitrate reductase (NarGH), while the direct electron transfer to nitrite reductase (cd1NiR) is inhibited due to the physiological distance limit of active sites (&gt;14&#8197;&#197;). By means of the directional electron transfer between g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;CN and extracted biological enzymes, the product of the denitrification reaction was switched from inert N2 to usable nitrite with an unprecedented selectivity of up to 95.3&#8201;%. The converted nitrite could be further utilized by anammox microbiota and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia (DNRA) microorganisms, doubling the efficiency of total nitrogen removal (96.5&#177;2.3&#8201;%) for biological nitrogen removal and ammonia generation (12.6&#8197;mg NH4+&#8208;N&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), respectively. Thus, our work paves an appealing way for the sustainable treatment and utilization of nitrate for ammonia fuel production by strategically regulating the electron transfer pathway across the biotic&#8208;abiotic interface.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Stable Electrochemical CO2 Capture using Redox&#8208;Active Heterocyclic Benzodithiophene Quinone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 capture was achieved with over 90&#8201;% capacity utilization in a 100&#8208;hour cycle using a heterocyclic benzodithiophene quinone in a flow system containing 13&#8201;% CO2 and 3.5&#8201;% O2, demonstrating its potential for real&#8208;world applications. This process was investigated through a combined experimental and computational approach to elucidate the kinetic and thermodynamic mechanisms underlying the carbon capture efficiency.







Abstract
Electrochemical carbon capture offers a promising alternative to thermal amine technology, which serves as the traditional benchmark method for CO2 capture. Despite its technological maturity, the widespread deployment of thermal amine technologies is hindered by high energy consumption and sorbent degradation. In contrast, electrochemical methods, with their inherently isothermal operation, address these challenges, offering enhanced energy efficiency and robustness. Among emerging strategies, electrochemical carbon capture systems using redox&#8208;active materials such as quinones stand out for their potential to capture CO2. However, their practical application is currently limited by their low stability in the presence of oxygen. We demonstrate that benzodithiophene quinone (BDT&#8208;Q), a heterocyclic quinone, exhibits high stability in electrochemical carbon capture processes with oxygen&#8208;containing feed gas. Conducted in a cyclic flow system with a simulated flue gas mixture containing 13&#8201;% CO2 and 3.5&#8201;% O2 for over 100&#8197;hours, the process demonstrates high oxygen stability with an electron utilization of 0.83 without significant degradation, indicating a promising approach for real world applications. Our study explores the potential of new heterocyclic quinone compounds in the context of carbon capture technologies.

         <title>Anion Modulation: Enabling Highly Conductive Stable Polymer Electrolytes for Solid&#8208;State Li&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a design concept of an anion&#8208;modulated polymer electrolyte with high ionic conductivity and decent interfacial compatibility. By combining high&#8208;voltage&#8208;resistant and high charge density units with an anion receptor unit, we get a polymer electrolyte which possesses a wide electrochemical window (5.55&#8197;V versus Li/Li+) and a high ionic conductivity (3.80&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) at room temperature. The anion&#8208;modulated structure makes it compatible with both Li&#8208;metal anode and high&#8208;voltage LCO cathode. This work provides new insight into the design of high&#8208;performance polymer electrolytes through anion modulation.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are promising ionic conductors for developing high&#8208;specific&#8208;energy solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. However, developing SPEs with both high ionic conductivity and interfacial compatibility remains a challenge. Here, we propose a design concept of an anion&#8208;modulated polymer electrolyte (termed AMPE) for high&#8208;voltage Li metal batteries. Specifically, we design the AMPE by incorporating high&#8208;voltage&#8208;resistant and high charge density units with an anion receptor unit. The high&#8208;voltage&#8208;resistant and high charge density segments contribute to achieving a decent voltage tolerance of the polymer chains and ensure sufficient carrier ions. The anion receptor, represented by a boron&#8208;containing molecule, promotes the generation of free Li+ by dissociating anion&#8208;cation pairs. More importantly, the strong interaction between the electron&#8208;deficient B and the TFSI&#8722; in the matrix promotes the anion reduction to form a stable anion&#8208;derived mosaic&#8208;like solid electrolyte interphase on the Li&#8208;metal anode. As a result, the AMPE exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 3.80&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and effectively suppresses lithium dendrites, enabling an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li|AMPE|LiCoO2 cell to achieve a cycle life of 700&#8197;cycles at an operating voltage of 4.40&#8197;V. This design concept would inspire efforts to develop high&#8208;performance SPEs for high&#8208;specific&#8208;energy solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.

The high-voltage-resistant and high charge density segments contribute to achieving a decent voltage tolerance of the polymer chains and ensure sufficient carrier ions. The anion receptor, represented by a boron-containing molecule, promotes the generation of free Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; by dissociating anion-cation pairs. More importantly, the strong interaction between the electron-deficient B and the TFSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in the matrix promotes the anion reduction to form a stable anion-derived mosaic-like solid electrolyte interphase on the Li-metal anode. As a result, the AMPE exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 3.80&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and effectively suppresses lithium dendrites, enabling an all-solid-state Li|AMPE|LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cell to achieve a cycle life of 700&#8197;cycles at an operating voltage of 4.40&#8197;V. This design concept would inspire efforts to develop high-performance SPEs for high-specific-energy solid-state lithium metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organic Cationic&#8208;Coordinated Perfluoropolymer Electrolytes with Strong Li+&#8208;Solvent Interaction for Solid State Li&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have designed unique copolymerized perfluoropolymer electrolytes to enlarge the molecular distance through the ionic dipole interactions between the perfluoropolymer chains and solvated molecules based on ionic liquid and lithium salt, which strongly facilitate the transport of Li+, achieving solid&#8208;state batteries with superior performance.







Abstract
The practical application of solid&#8208;state polymer lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) is plagued by the inferior ionic conductivity of the applied polymer electrolytes (PEs), which is caused by the coupling of ion transport with the motion of polymer segments. Here, solvated molecules based on ionic liquid and lithium salt with strong Li+&#8208;solvent interaction are inserted into an elaborately engineered perfluoropolymer electrolyte via ionic dipole interaction, extensively facilitating Li+ transport and improving mechanical properties. The intensified formation of solvation structures of contact ion pairs and ionic aggregates, as well as the strong electron&#8208;withdrawal properties of the F atoms in perfluoropolymers, give the PE high electrochemical stability and excellent interfacial stability. As a result, Li||Li symmetric cells demonstrate a lifetime of 2500&#8197;h and an exceptionally high critical current density above 2.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, Li||LiFePO4 batteries exhibit consistent cycling for 550&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;C, and Li||uncoated LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cells achieve 1000&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C with an average Coulombic efficiency of 98.45&#8201;%, one of the best results reported to date based on PEs. Our discovery sheds fresh light on the targeted synergistic regulation of the electro&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical properties of PEs to extend the cycle life of LMBs.

         <title>Outstanding Circularly Polarized TADF in Chiral Cu(I) Emitters: From Design to Application in CP&#8208;TADF OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral Cu(I) emitters exhibiting circularly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;TADF) with a record&#8208;high quantum yield (close to 100&#8201;%) and high dissymmetry factor (|glum|~1&#215;10&#8722;2) have been developed. Based on these emitters, efficient CP&#8208;TADF OLEDs with high |gEL| factors of 1.5&#215;10&#8722;2 were fabricated. It was also discovered that a magnetic field significantly suppresses the CP&#8208;TADF of chiral Cu(I) emitters.







Abstract
Low&#8208;cost molecular emitters that merge circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties are attractive for many high&#8208;tech applications. However, the design of such emitters remains a difficult task. To address this challenge, here, we propose a simple and efficient strategy, demonstrated by the design of pseudochiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal complexes [Cu(L*)DPEPhos]PF6 bearing a (+)/(&#8722;)&#8208;menthol&#8208;derived 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligand (L*). These complexes exhibit a yellow CP&#8208;TADF with a record&#8208;high quantum yield (close to 100&#8201;%) and high dissymmetry factor (|glum|~1&#215;10&#8722;2). Remarkably, the above compounds also show a negative thermal&#8208;quenching (NTQ) of luminescence in the 300&#8211;77&#8197;K range. Exploiting the designed Cu(I) emitters, we fabricated efficient CP&#8208;TADF OLEDs displaying mirror&#8208;imaged CPL bands with high |gEL| factors of 1.5&#215;10&#8722;2 and the maximum EQE of 6.15&#8201;%. Equally important, using the (+)&#8208;[Cu(L*)DPEPhos]PF6 complex, we have discovered that an external magnetic field noticeably suppresses CP&#8208;TADF of Cu(I) emitters. These findings are an important contribution to the CPL phenomenon and provide access to highly efficient, low&#8208;cost and robust CP&#8208;TADF emitters.

         <title>A High&#8208;capacity Benzoquinone Derivative Anode for All&#8208;organic Long&#8208;cycle Aqueous Proton Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetraamino&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (TABQ) was introduced as an organic anode for proton batteries. Benefiting from the intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond network, fast and efficient Grotthuss proton conduction is enabled in the solid&#8208;state with low activation energy (192.7&#8197;meV). When coupling with tetrachloro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (TCBQ) cathode, the all&#8208;organic proton battery achieves long stability over 3500&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Quinone compounds, with the ability to uptake protons, are promising electrodes for aqueous batteries. However, their applications are limited by the mediocre working potential range and inferior rate performance. Herein, we examined quinones bearing different substituents, and for the first time introduce tetraamino&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (TABQ) as anode material for proton batteries. The strong electron&#8208;donating amino groups can effectively narrow the band gap and lower the redox potentials of quinone materials. The protonation of amino groups and the amorphization of structure result in the formation of an intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond network, supporting Grotthuss&#8208;type proton conduction in the electrode with a low activation energy of 192.7&#8197;meV. The energy storage mechanism revealed by operando FT&#8208;IR and ex situ XPS features a reversible quinone&#8208;hydroquinone conversion during cycling. TABQ demonstrates a remarkable specific capacity of 307&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is one of the highest among organic proton electrodes. An all&#8208;organic proton battery of TABQ//TCBQ has also been developed, achieving exceptional stability of 3500&#8197;cycles at room temperature and excellent performance at sub&#8208;zero temperature.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral Calix[4]arenes with Both Inherent and Axial Chirality via Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Intermolecular C&#8722;H Annulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented protocol for the asymmetric synthesis of calix[4]arenes through enantioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H annulation is reported. A broad range of inherently chiral calix[4]arenes with noteworthy optical properties (&#934;F up to 0.94) have been constructed in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities (72 examples, up to 99&#8201;% yield and up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee).







Abstract
Inherently chiral calixarenes have garnered significant attention due to their distinctive properties, yet the development of efficient catalytic asymmetric synthesis methods remains a critical challenge. Herein, we report the asymmetric synthesis of calix[4]arenes featuring inherent or both inherent and axial chirality via a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation/annulation strategy in high yield with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). Electrooxidation was also suitable for this transformation to obviate the sacrificial metal oxidants, underscoring the environmentally friendly potential of this approach. A key octahedral cobaltacycle intermediate was synthesized and characterized, providing valuable insights into the mode of enantio&#8208; and diastereocontrol of this protocol. Noteworthy photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 0.94 were measured, underscoring the potential of these compounds in the domain of organic fluorescent materials.

     alt="Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral Calix[4]arenes with Both Inherent and Axial Chirality via Cobalt-Catalyzed Enantioselective Intermolecular C&#8722;H Annulation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unprecedented protocol for the asymmetric synthesis of calix[4]arenes through enantioselective cobalt-catalyzed C&#8722;H annulation is reported. A broad range of inherently chiral calix[4]arenes with noteworthy optical properties (&lt;i&gt;&#934;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; up to 0.94) have been constructed in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities (72 examples, up to 99&#8201;% yield and up to &amp;gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;&lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inherently chiral calixarenes have garnered significant attention due to their distinctive properties, yet the development of efficient catalytic asymmetric synthesis methods remains a critical challenge. Herein, we report the asymmetric synthesis of calix[4]arenes featuring inherent or both inherent and axial chirality via a cobalt-catalyzed C&#8722;H activation/annulation strategy in high yield with excellent enantio- and diastereoselectivity (up to &amp;gt;99&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt; and &amp;gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 &lt;i&gt;dr&lt;/i&gt;). Electrooxidation was also suitable for this transformation to obviate the sacrificial metal oxidants, underscoring the environmentally friendly potential of this approach. A key octahedral cobaltacycle intermediate was synthesized and characterized, providing valuable insights into the mode of enantio- and diastereocontrol of this protocol. Noteworthy photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 0.94 were measured, underscoring the potential of these compounds in the domain of organic fluorescent materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Luminescent Radicals with Emission Peaks over 750&#8197;nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed two near&#8208;infrared (NIR) radical emitters with record&#8208;high photoluminescence quantum efficiency among metal&#8208;free organic NIR emitters with emission peaks exceeding 750&#8197;nm. The donor&#8208;acceptor molecular structure allows the designed radical emitter to exhibit charge&#8208;transfer excited state and spatially separated electron and hole levels with non&#8208;bonding character. Both the high&#8208;frequency and low&#8208;frequency vibrations coupling in D1 are effectively reduced, leading to significantly suppressed non&#8208;radiative decay rate. As a result, the &#8220;energy gap law&#8221; is violated and exceptional luminescence efficiency is achieved.







Abstract
Purely organic molecules exhibiting near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission possess considerable potential for applications in both biological and optoelectronic technological domains, owing to their inherent advantages such as cost&#8208;effectiveness, biocompatibility, and facile chemical modifiability. However, the repertoire of such molecules with emission peaks exceeding 750&#8197;nm and concurrently demonstrating high photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) remains relatively scarce due to the energy gap law. Herein, we report two open&#8208;shell NIR radical emitters, denoted as DMNA&#8208;Cz&#8208;BTM and DMNA&#8208;PyID&#8208;BTM, achieved through the strategic integration of a donor group (DMNA) onto the Cz&#8208;BTM and PyID&#8208;BTM frameworks, respectively. We found that the donor&#8208;acceptor molecular structure allows the two designed radical emitters to exhibit a charge&#8208;transfer excited state and spatially separated electron and hole levels with non&#8208;bonding characteristics. Thus, the high&#8208;frequency vibrations are effectively suppressed. Besides, the reduction of low&#8208;frequency vibrations is observed. Collectively, the non&#8208;radiative decay channel is significantly suppressed, leading to exceptional NIR PLQE values. Specifically, DMNA&#8208;Cz&#8208;BTM manifests an emission peak at 758&#8197;nm alongside a PLQE of 55&#8201;%, whereas DMNA&#8208;PyID&#8208;BTM exhibits an emission peak at 778&#8197;nm with a PLQE of 66&#8201;%. Notably, these represent the pinnacle of PLQE among metal&#8208;free organic NIR emitters with emission peaks surpassing 750&#8197;nm.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Growth of One&#8208;Dimensional Blocking Layer to Mitigate Deficient Surface of Single&#8208;Crystal Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective strategy is proposed to mitigate the surface issue of perovskite single crystals by inserting one&#8208;dimensional perovskites. Benefiting from the suppressed ion migration, the solar cells based on Cs0.05FA0.95PbI3 single crystal retain 90&#8201;% of its initial efficiency after 1000&#8197;hours of operation, which is the best report at present. This strategy is also instructive for optimizing other single&#8208;crystal perovskite optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
Organic&#8208;inorganic halide perovskite (OIHP) single crystals are promising for optoelectronic application, but their high surface trap density and associated ion migration hinders device performance and stability. Herein, a one&#8208;dimensional (1D) perovskites are designed and proposed as blocking layer at the crystal/electrode interface to mitigate the surface issues. As a model system, the interface ion migration in Cs0.05FA0.95PbI3 (FA=formamidinium) single&#8208;crystal perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is obviously suppressed, leading to increase of T90 lifetime from 260 to 1000&#8197;hours, five times better than previously reported results. Besides, the reduction of surface iodide ion vacancies inhibits nonradiative recombination, thus increasing the efficiency from 22.1&#8201;% to 23.8&#8201;%, which is one of the highest values for single&#8208;crystal PSCs. Since the deficient crystal surface is a universal and open issue, our strategy is instructive for optimizing diverse single&#8208;crystal perovskite devices.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Chiral Dichroism of Chiral Lanthanide Complexes in the Context of Richardson's Theory of Optical Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report on the Magneto&#8208;Chiral Dichroism of two pairs of ErIII and TmIII chiral complexes investigated through visible and near&#8208;infrared light absorption in a wide temperature (4&#8211;290&#8197;K) and magnetic field (0&#8211;5 T) range. The results are presented and discussed in the frame of the Richardson's theory of lanthanides optical activity originally developed to identify the most promising chiroptical transitions for lanthanide&#8208;based systems.







Abstract
Here we report on the Magneto&#8208;Chiral Dichroism (MChD) detected through visible and near&#8208;infrared light absorption of two enantiomeric pairs of ErIII and TmIII chiral complexes featuring a propeller&#8208;like molecular structure. The magnetic properties show typical features of isolated paramagnetic ions associated with 4I15/2 and 3H6 ground state terms. MChD spectroscopy shows high gMChD dissymmetry factors of ca. 0.12 T&#8722;1 and 0.05 T&#8722;1 (T=4.0&#8197;K and B=1.0 T) for ErIII and TmIII, respectively, associated with the magnetic&#8208;dipole allowed 4I13/2 &#8592; 4I15/2 and 3H5 &#8592; 3H6 transitions. MChD signals of the two complexes were detected up to room temperature and under magnetic fields up to 5.0 T. For the first time, the MChD results are discussed in the context of the Richardson theory of lanthanide optical activity and provide clear indications on the strongest MChD&#8208;active electronic transitions of lanthanide complexes.

         <title>Exploring the Complex Chemistry and Degradation of Ascorbic Acid in Aqueous Nanoparticle Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ascorbic acid (AA) under aqueous conditions undergoes degradation on a timescale relevant to nanoparticle synthesis, however, not to dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) as commonly believed. This degree of degradation of AA has a pronounced effect not only on the final morphology but also the shape yield of the metal nanoparticles. This knowledge has been utilized in the synthesis of gold nanorods to achieve significantly enhanced shape yield.







Abstract
Ascorbic acid (AA) is the most widely used reductant for noble metal nanoparticle (NP) synthesis. Despite the synthetic relevance, its aqueous chemistry remains misunderstood, due in part to various assumptions about its reduction pathway which are insufficiently supported by experimental evidence. This study aims to provide an understanding of the complex chemistry associated with AA under aqueous conditions. We demonstrate that (i) AA undergoes appreciable degradation in alkaline solution on a timescale relevant to NP synthesis, (ii) contrary to popular belief, AA does not degrade into dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), nor is DHA the oxidized product of AA under noble metal NP synthetic conditions, (iii) DHA, which readily degrades under alkaline conditions, can also effectively reduce metal salt precursors to metal NPs, (iv) neither ascorbate nor dehydroascorbate act as surface capping agents post&#8208;synthetically on the NPs (v) AA degradation time greatly affects the morphology and polydispersity of the resultant NP. Results from our mechanistic investigation enabled us to utilize purposefully&#8208;aged reductants to achieve control over shape yield and monodispersity in the seed&#8208;mediated synthesis of Au nanorods.

     alt="Exploring the Complex Chemistry and Degradation of Ascorbic Acid in Aqueous Nanoparticle Synthesis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ascorbic acid (AA) under aqueous conditions undergoes degradation on a timescale relevant to nanoparticle synthesis, however, not to dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) as commonly believed. This degree of degradation of AA has a pronounced effect not only on the final morphology but also the shape yield of the metal nanoparticles. This knowledge has been utilized in the synthesis of gold nanorods to achieve significantly enhanced shape yield.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ascorbic acid (AA) is the most widely used reductant for noble metal nanoparticle (NP) synthesis. Despite the synthetic relevance, its aqueous chemistry remains misunderstood, due in part to various assumptions about its reduction pathway which are insufficiently supported by experimental evidence. This study aims to provide an understanding of the complex chemistry associated with AA under aqueous conditions. We demonstrate that (i) AA undergoes appreciable degradation in alkaline solution on a timescale relevant to NP synthesis, (ii) contrary to popular belief, AA does not degrade into dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), nor is DHA the oxidized product of AA under noble metal NP synthetic conditions, (iii) DHA, which readily degrades under alkaline conditions, can also effectively reduce metal salt precursors to metal NPs, (iv) neither ascorbate nor dehydroascorbate act as surface capping agents post-synthetically on the NPs (v) AA degradation time greatly affects the morphology and polydispersity of the resultant NP. Results from our mechanistic investigation enabled us to utilize purposefully-aged reductants to achieve control over shape yield and monodispersity in the seed-mediated synthesis of Au nanorods. Our findings have important implications for achieving monodispersed products in the many metal NP synthesis reactions that make use of AA as a reducing agent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>6&#8208;Hydroxy Picolinohydrazides Promoted Cu(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroxylation Reaction in Water: Machine&#8208;Learning Accelerated Ligands Design and Reaction Optimization</title>

         <dc:description>
The Cu/6&#8208;hydroxypicolinamide&#8208;catalyzed hydroxylation reaction of (hetero)aryl halides in water is described. For bromides, reaction worked well with a minimal catalyst loading of 0.01&#8197;mol&#8201;% at 80&#8201;&#176;C. For chlorides, hydroxylation proceeded at 100&#8201;&#176;C with 2&#8211;3&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst loading. These represent the state of art for both lowest catalyst loading and temperature in the copper&#8208;catalyzed hydroxylation reactions.







Abstract
Hydroxylated (hetero)arenes are privileged motifs in natural products, materials, small&#8208;molecule pharmaceuticals and serve as versatile intermediates in synthetic organic chemistry. Herein, we report an efficient Cu(I)/6&#8208;hydroxy picolinohydrazide&#8208;catalyzed hydroxylation reaction of (hetero)aryl halides (Br, Cl) in water. By establishing machine learning (ML) models, the design of ligands and optimization of reaction conditions were effectively accelerated.

N&#8208;(2,7&#8208;Di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxypicolinamide (L42, 6&#8208;HPA&#8208;DTBCA) displayed superior reaction activity for chloride substrates, enabling hydroxylation reactions at 100&#8201;&#176;C with 2&#8211;3&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst loading. These represent the state of art for both lowest catalyst loading and temperature in the copper&#8208;catalyzed hydroxylation reactions. Furthermore, this method features a sustainable and environmentally friendly solvent system, accommodates a wide range of substrates, and shows potential for developing robust and scalable synthesis processes for key pharmaceutical intermediates.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Triggered Spin&#8208;Magnetic Effect in Rare Earth Intraparticle Heterostructured Nanoalloys for Boosting Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The antiferromagnetic couplings between rare earth and 3d transition&#8208;metal were achieved by creating RhCo&#8722;RhGd intraparticle heterostructured nanoalloys (IHAs), which could regulate the spin polarization of active sites to optimize adsorption and dissociation of H2O, thus boosting hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). RhCo&#8722;RhGd IHAs demonstrated excellent alkaline HER catalytic activity, with a small overpotential of 11.3&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and robust stability over 100&#8197;h operation.







Abstract
Rare earth (RE) elements are attractive for spin&#8208;magnetic modulation due to their unique 4&#8201;f electron configuration and strong orbital couplings. Alloying RE with conventional 3d transition&#8208;metal (TM) is promising for the fabrication of advanced spin catalysts yet remains much difficulties in preparation, which leads to the mysteries of spin&#8208;magnetic effect between RE and 3d TM on catalysis. Here we define a solid&#8208;phase synthetic protocol for creating RE&#8208;3d TM&#8208;noble metal integrated intraparticle heterostructured nanoalloys (IHAs) with distinct Gd and Co interface within the entire Rh framework, denoted as RhCo&#8722;RhGd IHAs. They exhibit interface&#8208;triggered antiferromagnetic interaction, which can induce electron redistribution and regulate spin polarization. Theoretical calculations further reveal that active sites around the heterointerface with weakened spin polarization optimize the adsorption and dissociation of H2O, thus promoting alkaline hydrogen evolution catalysis. The RhCo&#8722;RhGd IHAs show a small overpotential of 11.3&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, as well as remarkable long&#8208;term stability, far superior to previously reported Rh&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Enhancing Hole Transport Uniformity for Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells through Optimizing Buried Interface Contacts and Suppressing Interface Recombination</title>

P&#8208;xylylenediphosphonic acid (p&#8208;XPA) was introduced between the hole transport layer (HTL) and the perovskite film. P&#8208;XPA made the HTL planar, promoted perovskite crystallization, and effectively passivated the bottom defects of the perovskite film. Ultimately, the device power conversion efficiency reached 25.87&#8201;% and the stability was significantly improved.







Abstract
[4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9yl)butyl]phosphonic acid (Me&#8208;4PACz) self&#8208;assembly material has been recognized as a highly effective approach for mitigating nickel oxide (NiOx) surface&#8208;related challenges in inverted perovskite solar cells (IPSCs). However, its uneven film generation and failure to effectively passivate the buried interface defects limit the device&#8216;s performance improvement potential. Herein, p&#8208;xylylenediphosphonic acid (p&#8208;XPA) containing bilateral phosphate groups (&#8722;PO3H2) is introduced as an interface layer between the NiOx/Me&#8208;4PACz and the perovskite layer. P&#8208;XPA can flatten the surface of hole transport layer and optimize interface contact. Meanwhile, p&#8208;XPA achieves better energy level alignment and promotes interfacial hole transport. In addition, the bilateral &#8722;PO3H2 of p&#8208;XPA can chelate with Pb2+ and form hydrogen bond with FA+ (formamidinium cation), thereby suppressing buried interface non&#8208;radiative recombination loss. Consequently, the IPSC with p&#8208;XPA buried interface modification achieves champion power conversion efficiency of 25.87&#8201;% (certified at 25.45&#8201;%) at laboratory scale (0.0448&#8197;cm2). The encapsulated target device exhibits better operational stability. Even after 1100&#8197;hours of maximum power point tracking at 50&#8201;&#176;C, its efficiency remains at an impressive 82.7&#8201;% of the initial efficiency. Molecules featuring bilateral passivation groups optimize interfacial contact and inhibit interfacial recombination, providing an effective approach to enhancing the stability and efficiency of devices.

         <dc:description>
An exceptional photosensitization process of radical photopolymerization by singlet&#8208;singlet energy transfer was found when using optical brighteners in a photopolymerizable resin containing phosphine oxide as photoinitiator.







Abstract
A remarkable and unexpected increase in the photopolymerization efficiency of an acrylic resin by a bisacylphosphine oxide photoinitiator was observed when an optical brightener was present in the medium. High values for the maximal rates of photopolymerization were obtained by RT&#8208;FTIR at 365&#8197;nm under a very low irradiance of 1&#8197;mW/cm2. Fluorescence studies revealed that the quenching process occurs through singlet&#8208;singlet energy transfer between the first singlet excited state of the optical brightener and the ground state photoinitiator. This mechanism acts as an additional pathway for the excitation of the photoinitiator, thereby increasing the total amount of initiating radicals. Using the F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer model, we calculated the relative efficiency of the photosensitization process with respect to the direct excitation efficiency of the photoinitiator. The results demonstrate that the photosensitization process can be predicted, paving the way for further improvements in photoinitiating systems.

         <title>Engineering Robust Triazine Crosslinked and Pyridine Capped Anion Exchange Membrane for Advanced Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a robust triazine crosslinked and pyridine capped anion exchange membrane (AEM) for water electrolysis. The AEMWE with non&#8208;precious metal catalysts, achieved an outstanding current density of up to 3.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 2&#8197;V and could be operated ~430&#8197;h at 1.6&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which exceeded the advanced AEMWEs.







Abstract
Exploring high&#8208;performance anion exchange membranes (AEM) for water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) is significant for green hydrogen production. However, the current AEMWEs are restricted by the poor mechanical strength and low OH&#8722; conductivity of AEMs, leading to the low working stability and low current density. Here, we develop a robust AEM with polybiphenylpiperidium network by combining the crosslinking with triazine and the capping with pyridine for advanced AEMWEs. The AEM exhibits an excellent mechanical strength (79.4&#8197;MPa), low swelling ratio (19.2&#8201;%), persistent alkali stability (&#8776;5,000&#8197;hours) and high OH&#8722; conductivity (247.2&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1) which achieves the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art AEMs. Importantly, when applied in AEMWEs, the corresponding electrolyzer equipped with commercial nickel iron and nickel molybdenum catalysts obtained a current density of up to 3.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 2&#8197;V and could be stably operated ~430&#8197;h at a high current density of 1.6&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which exceeds the most of AEMWEs. Our results suggest that triazine crosslinking and pyridine capping can effectively improve the overall performance of the AEMWEs.

         <title>Low&#8208;Solvent&#8208;Coordination Solvation Structure for Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries via Electric Dipole&#8208;Dipole Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electric dipole&#8208;dipole interaction enables the interfacial richness of high&#8208;dipole FPy with low coordination towards Li+, extruding the coordinated solvent in the primary solvation sheath through steric hindrance. The low&#8208;solvent&#8208;coordination structure strengthens Li+&#8208;TFSI&#8722; coordination, facilitating TFSI&#8722; decomposition to generate a LiF&#8208;rich SEI film.







Abstract
Unveiling inherent interactions among solvents, Li+ ions, and anions are crucial in dictating solvation&#8208;desolvation kinetics at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Developing an electrolyte with a low ion&#8208;transport barrier and minimal solvent coordination in its interfacial solvation structure is essential for forming an anion&#8208;derived solid&#8208;electrolyte interface, a key component for high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;metal batteries. In this study, we harness electric dipole&#8208;dipole synergistic interactions to formulate an electrolyte with significantly reduced interfacial solvent coordination. Operando characterization and theoretical analysis reveal that 2&#8208;fluoropyridine (FPy) with high dipole preferentially adsorbs onto the Li metal surface. The adsorbed FPy molecule squeezes succinonitrile in the primary solvation sheath through steric hindrance, leading to the formation of an inorganic&#8208;rich interphase. Consequently, the introduction of FPy enhances the reversible capacity of the LiCoO2||Li cell, which maintains a capacity of 143&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles at a 1&#8197;C rate. Moreover, the cycle life of LiCoO2 batteries with a limited supply of lithium extends from 120 cycles to over 200 cycles. These findings offer a strategy that can be applied broadly to design interfacial solvation structures for various metal&#8208;ion/metal&#8208;based batteries.

The key to solve the bottleneck problem for PIBs anode with alloying element is to provide sufficient buffer and restraint for the unavoidable volume expansion and stabilized structure. Our work innovatively presented a new route to chemically confine alloying element in a cubic framework to effectively provide stable structure. Demonstrated by in situ XRD and other characterizations, owing to the stabilized structure, the rationally designed anode yields stable electrochemical performance and zero&#8208;strain potassium storage.







Abstract
PIBs are emerging as a promising energy storage system due to high abundance of potassium resources and theoretical energy density, however, progress of PIBs is severely hindered by structural instability and poor cycling of anode material during continual insertion and extraction of larger&#8208;sized K+. Hence, developing anode material with structural stability and stable cycling remains a great challenge. Herein, band gap&#8208;tuned Mo&#8208;doped and carbon&#8208;coated lead titanate (CMPTO) with zero&#8208;strain K+ storage is presented as ultra&#8208;stable PIBs anode. Mo doping introduces narrowed band gap and optimized crystal lattice for enhanced intrinsic electron and ion transfer. Demonstrated by in situ XRD characterizations, the crystal structure stays stable with unchanged peak positions, fully revealing zero&#8208;strain characteristic of CMPTO anode during potassium storage for stable cyclic capability. Ultimately, CMPTO anode achieved ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance of 7000 cycles at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 with high capacity retention of 90&#8201;% and considerable specific capacity of 130.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 600 cycles at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1; with relatively large density, CMPTO realized eminent volumetric capacity of 1111.09&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;3 and ultra&#8208;long cycling life of 10000 cycles at 7041&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;3. This work introduces a promisingly new route into developing anode materials with ultra&#8208;stable performance for PIBs.

Programmable in&#8208;situ co&#8208;assembly engineering, combining multi&#8208;stop spontaneous self&#8208;assembly processes, were utilized to promote the synthesis of multi&#8208;block organic heterostructures (OHs) with a rational arrangement of three or more segments. The rational design of segments enables exciton manipulation and ensures proper output among the multi&#8208;segment OHs. This work enables the controllable growth of segments within multi&#8208;block OHs, providing a pathway to construct complex OHs for the rational development of future optical applications.







Abstract
Organic heterostructures (OHs) with multi&#8208;segments exhibit special optoelectronic properties compared with monomeric structures. Nevertheless, the synthesis of multi&#8208;block heterostructures remains challenging due to compatibility issues between segment parts, which restricts their application in optical waveguides and integrated optics. Herein, we demonstrate programmable in&#8208;situ co&#8208;assembly engineering, combining multi&#8208;step spontaneous self&#8208;assembly processes to promote the synthesis of multi&#8208;block heterostructures with a rational arrangement of three or more segments. The rational design of segments enables exciton manipulation and ensures optical waveguides and proper output among the multi&#8208;segment OHs.

&lt;p&gt;Programmable in-situ co-assembly engineering, combining multi-stop spontaneous self-assembly processes, were utilized to promote the synthesis of multi-block organic heterostructures (OHs) with a rational arrangement of three or more segments. The rational design of segments enables exciton manipulation and ensures proper output among the multi-segment OHs. This work enables the controllable growth of segments within multi-block OHs, providing a pathway to construct complex OHs for the rational development of future optical applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic heterostructures (OHs) with multi-segments exhibit special optoelectronic properties compared with monomeric structures. Nevertheless, the synthesis of multi-block heterostructures remains challenging due to compatibility issues between segment parts, which restricts their application in optical waveguides and integrated optics. Herein, we demonstrate programmable in-situ co-assembly engineering, combining multi-step spontaneous self-assembly processes to promote the synthesis of multi-block heterostructures with a rational arrangement of three or more segments. The rational design of segments enables exciton manipulation and ensures optical waveguides and proper output among the multi-segment OHs. This work enables the controllable growth of segments within multi-block OHs, providing a pathway to construct complex OHs for the rational development of future optical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organic&#8208;Inorganic Coupling Strategy: Clamp Effect to Capture Mg2+ for Aqueous Magnesium Ion Capacitor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work utilizes an organic&#8211;inorganic coupling strategy to prepare a composite cathode material consisting of EDA and Mn2O3 with double&#8208;energy storage mechanisms. Not only the outer layer of cloud&#8208;like EDA can effectively prevent the structural collapse of internal Mn2O3 during the charging and discharging process, but also can capture Mg2+ by its bidentate chelating ligand.







Abstract
The rapid transport kinetics of divalent magnesium ions are crucial for achieving distinguished performance in aqueous magnesium&#8208;ion battery&#8208;based energy storage capacitors. However, the strong electrostatic interaction between Mg2+ with double charges and the host material significantly restricts Mg2+ diffusivity. In this study, a new composite material, EDA&#8208;Mn2O3, with double&#8208;energy storage mechanisms comprising an organic phase (ethylenediamine, EDA) and an inorganic phase (manganese sesquioxide) was successfully synthesized via an organic&#8211;inorganic coupling strategy. Inorganic&#8208;phase Mn2O3 serves as a scaffold structure, enabling the stable and reversible intercalation/deintercalation of magnesium ions. The organic phase EDA adsorbed onto the surface of Mn2O3 as an elastic matrix, works synergistically with Mn2O3, and utilizes bidentate chelating ligands to capture Mg2+. The robust coordination effect of terminal biprotonic amine in EDA enhances the structural diversity and specific capacity characteristics of the composite material, as further corroborated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, ex situ XRD, XPS, and Raman spectroscopy. As expected, the EDA&#8208;Mn2O3 composite achieved an outstanding specific discharge capacity of 188.97&#8197;mAh/g at 0.1&#8197;A/g. Additionally, an aqueous magnesium ion capacitor with EDA&#8208;Mn2O3 serving as the cathode can reach 110.17&#8197;Wh/kg, which stands out among the aqueous magnesium ion capacitors that have been reported thus far. The abundant reversible redox sites are ensured by the strategic design concept based on the synergistic structure and composition advantages of organic and inorganic phases. This study aimed to explore the practical application value of organic&#8208;inorganic composite electrodes with double&#8208;energy storage mechanisms.

         <title>Influence of Chloride and Electrolyte Stability on Passivation Layer Evolution at the Negative Electrode of Mg Batteries Revealed by operando EQCM&#8208;D</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding passivation layer formation, its morphology and dissolution is essential to systematically develop electrolytes which enable highly reversible Mg deposition. By applying operando electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring, the impact of chloride and differences between more and less stable electrolytes are revealed, showing that highly efficient interphase&#8208;free cycling is possible.







Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries are promising for future energy storage. However, among other challenges, their practical application is hindered by low coulombic efficiencies of magnesium plating and stripping. Fundamental processes such as the formation, structure, and stability of passivation layers and the influence of different electrolyte components on them are still not fully understood. In this work, we gain unique insights into the initial Mg plating and stripping cycles by comparing magnesium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Mg(TFSI)2)&#8208; and magnesium tetrakis(hexafluoroisopropyloxy)borate (Mg[B(hfip)4]2)&#8208;based electrolytes, each with and without MgCl2, on gold electrodes by highly sensitive operando electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (EQCM&#8722;D) applying hydrodynamic spectroscopy. With the stable Mg[B(hfip)4]2&#8208;based electrolytes, highly efficient and interphase&#8208;free cycling is possible and passivation layers are attributed to electrolyte contaminants. These are forming and degrading during the so&#8208;called initial conditioning process. With the more reactive Mg(TFSI)2&#8208;based electrolyte, thick passivation layers with small pores are growing during cycling. We demonstrate that the addition of chloride lowers the amount of passivated Mg deposits in these electrolytes and accelerates the currentless dissolution of the passivation layer. This has a positive effect since we observe the most efficient cycling and uniform deposition when no interphase is present on the electrode.

         <title>Live&#8208;Cell Identification of Inhibitors of the Lipid Transfer Protein CERT Using Nanoluciferase Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (NanoBRET)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
There are many assays for monitoring enzymatic reactions. But how can the intracellular transport of lipids be analyzed efficiently? Here, an assay for the ceramide transfer protein CERT using nanoluciferase bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (NanoBRET) is presented. A combinatorial synthesis of analogs of a known inhibitor was used for validation and identified inhibitors with superior potency.







Abstract
A BRET system is described, in which Nanoluciferase was fused to the lipid transfer protein CERT for efficient energy transfer to a Nile red&#8208;labeled ceramide, which is either directly bound to CERT or transported to the adjacent Golgi membrane. Bulk formation of sphingomyelin, a major plasma membrane component in mammals, is dependent on CERT&#8208;mediated transfer of its predecessor ceramide. CERT is considered a promising drug target but no direct cell&#8208;based methods exist to efficiently identify inhibitors. The utility of the method was demonstrated by a library of 140 derivatives of the CERT inhibitor HPA&#8208;12. These were obtained in a combinatorial synthesis using solid&#8208;phase transacylation. Screening of the library led to six compounds that were picked and confirmed to be superior to HPA&#8208;12 in a subsequent dose&#8208;response study and also in an orthogonal lipidomics analysis.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Single&#8208;Molecule Infrared Imaging and Spectroscopy through Bond&#8208;Selective Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The measurement of bond&#8208;selective fluorescence facilitates mid&#8208;infrared (MIR) spectral imaging of single dye molecules under ambient conditions. This technique allows researchers to distinguish between different molecular states (e.g., monomer or dimer) based on in situ monitoring of changes in vibrational properties.







Abstract
Infrared (IR) spectroscopy stands as a workhorse for exploring bond vibrations, offering a wealth of chemical insights across diverse frontiers. With increasing focus on the regime of single molecules, obtaining IR&#8208;sensitive information from individual molecules at room temperature would provide essential information about unknown molecular properties. Here, we leverage bond&#8208;selective fluorescence microscopy, facilitated by narrowband picosecond mid&#8208;IR and near&#8208;IR double&#8208;resonance excitation, for high&#8208;throughput mid&#8208;IR structural probing of single molecules. We robustly capture single&#8208;molecule images and analyze the combined polarization dependence, vibrational peaks, linewidths, and lifetimes of probe molecules with representative scaffolds. From bulk to single molecules, we find that vibrational lifetimes remain consistent, while linewidths are narrowed by approximately twofold and anisotropy becomes more pronounced. Additionally, unexpected peak shifts from single molecules were observed, attributed to the generation of new modes due to previously unexplored dimerization, supported by quantum chemistry calculations. These findings underscore the importance of infrared analysis on individual single molecules in ambient environments, offering molecular information crucial for functional imaging and the investigation of the fundamental properties and utilities of luminescent molecules.

         <title>Regulated Charge Transfer in Donor&#8208;Acceptor Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Highly&#8208;Sensitive Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer approach is used to grow naphthalenediimide&#8208;based donor&#8208;acceptor MOF thin films for efficient free charge generation in response to light. Interestingly, we find that the optimum photocurrent response is obtained at a low optimal doping concentration of acceptor, which outperforms traditional donor&#8208;MOF thin films by a factor of forty.







Abstract
In photo&#8208;induced charge separation, organic thin films with donor and acceptor chromophores are vital for uses such as artificial photosynthesis and photodetection. The main challenges include optimizing charge separation efficiency and identifying the ideal acceptor/donor ratio. Achieving this is difficult due to the variability in molecular configurations within these typically amorphous organic aggregates. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) provide a structured solution by enabling systematic design of donor/acceptor blends with adjustable ratios within a crystalline lattice. We demonstrate this approach by incorporating donor and acceptor naphthalenediimide (NDI) chromophores as linkers in a highly oriented, monolithic MOF thin film. By adjusting the NDI acceptor linker concentration during the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of surface&#8208;anchored MOF thin films (SURMOFs), we significantly enhanced charge separation efficiency. Surprisingly, the optimum acceptor concentration was only 3&#8201;%, achieving a forty&#8208;fold increase in photodetection efficiency compared to baseline NDI donor&#8208;based SURMOFs. This unexpected behaviour was clarified through theoretical analysis enabled by the well&#8208;defined crystalline structure of the SURMOFs. Using density functional theory and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we identified two opposing effects from acceptors: the positive effect of suppressing undesirable charge carrier recombination is offset at high concentrations by a reduction in charge&#8208;carrier mobility.

         <title>Development of a FUT8 Inhibitor with Cellular Inhibitory Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Core fucosylation, catalyzed by &#945;&#8208;1,6&#8208;fucosyltransferase (FUT8), is associated with various diseases, including cancer. Therefore, selective FUT8 inhibitors for in vivo or cell&#8208;based systems are highly sought&#8208;after. A FUT8&#8208;selective inhibitor, which was discovered by high&#8208;throughput screening and further structural optimization, successfully inhibits FUT8 in living cells, paving the way for the development of drugs targeting core fucosylation.







Abstract
Core fucosylation is catalyzed by &#945;&#8208;1,6&#8208;fucosyltransferase (FUT8), which fucosylates the innermost GlcNAc of N&#8208;glycans. Given the association of FUT8 with various diseases, including cancer, selective FUT8 inhibitors applicable to in vivo or cell&#8208;based systems are highly sought&#8208;after. Herein, we report the discovery of a compound that selectively inhibits FUT8 in cell&#8208;based assays. High&#8208;throughput screening revealed a FUT8&#8208;inhibiting pharmacophore, and further structural optimization yielded an inhibitor with a KD value of 49&#8197;nM. Notably, this binding occurs only in the presence of GDP (a product of the enzymatic reaction catalyzed by FUT8). Mechanistic studies suggested that this inhibitor generates a highly reactive naphthoquinone methide derivative at the binding site in FUT8, which subsequently reacts with FUT8. Furthermore, prodrug derivatization of this inhibitor improved its stability, enabling suppression of core fucose expression and subsequent EGFR and T&#8208;cell signaling in cell&#8208;based assays, paving the way for the development of drugs targeting core fucosylation.

         <title>Oxytocin Analogues for the Oral Treatment of Abdominal Pain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Millions suffer from abdominal pain driven by gut disorders, with treatments ineffective and causing side effects. This work pioneered gut&#8208;stable peptides for oral administration targeting the oxytocin receptor on colonic nociceptors for abdominal pain suppression via a non&#8208;opioid&#8208;based gut&#8208;specific mechanism. This general concept of oral gut&#8208;specific/restricted peptide therapies provides new opportunities to combat gastrointestinal disorders.







Abstract
Abdominal pain presents an onerous reality for millions of people affected by gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The oxytocin receptor (OTR) has emerged as a new analgesic drug target with OTR expression upregulated on colon&#8208;innervating nociceptors in chronic visceral hypersensitivity states, accessible via luminal delivery. However, the low gastrointestinal stability of OTR's endogenous peptide ligand oxytocin (OT) is a bottleneck for therapeutic development. Here, we report the development of potent and fully gut&#8208;stable OT analogues, laying the foundation for a new area of oral gut&#8208;specific peptide therapeutics. Ligand optimisation guided by structure&#8208;gut&#8208;stability&#8208;activity relationships yielded highly stable analogues (t1/2&gt;24&#8197;h, compared to t1/2&lt;10&#8197;min of OT in intestinal fluid) equipotent to OT (~3&#8197;nM) and with enhanced OTR selectivity. Intra&#8208;colonic administration of the lead ligand significantly reduced colonic mechanical hypersensitivity in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner in a mouse model of chronic abdominal pain. Moreover, oral administration of the lead ligand also displayed significant analgesia in this abdominal pain mouse model. The generated ligands and employed strategies could pave the way to a new class of oral gut&#8208;specific peptides to study and combat chronic gastrointestinal disorders, an area with substantial unmet medical needs.

         <title>A Covalent Triazine Framework for Photocatalytic Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Hydrofunctionalizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydro&#8208;functionalization of alkenes is essential for synthesizing natural products, medicinally relevant compounds, and other important molecules. In this context, photocatalysis has emerged as a crucial tool for these reactions. However, existing methods rely on either expensive, or scarce metal photocatalysts, rendering this strategy less feasible for industrial applications. Herein, we disclose the first inexpensive porous heterogeneous material (oxidizing potential: +2.37&#8197;V vs SCE) designed to bridge the existing research gap. The careful selection of monomers to prepare the material enables us to achieve hydrocarboxylation, hydroamination, and hydroazidation across a wide range of electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing aromatic and aliphatic substrates.







Abstract
Porous materials&#8208;based heterogeneous photocatalysts, performing selective organic transformations, are increasing the applicability of photocatalytic reactions due to their ability to merge traditional photocatalysis with structured pores densely decorated with catalytic moiety for efficient mass and charge transfer, as well as added recyclability. We herein disclose a porous crystalline covalent triazine framework (CTF)&#8208;based heterogeneous photocatalyst that exhibits excellent photoredox properties for different hydrofunctionalization reactions such as hydrocarboxylations, hydroamination and hydroazidations. The high oxidizing property of this CTF enables the activation of styrenes, followed by regioselective C&#8722;N and C&#8722;O bond formation at ambient conditions. A change in the physicochemical and optoelectronic properties of the CTF, upon protonation during catalysis, lies at the basis of its photocatalytic properties. This allows us to obtain hydrocarboxylations, hydroamination, and hydroazidations from a myriad of electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing aromatic and aliphatic substrates. This catalytic approach is further extended to late&#8208;stage functionalization of bio&#8208;active molecules. Finally, detailed characterizations of the CTF and further mechanistic investigations provide mechanistic insights into these reactions.

         <title>Fast Collective Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Dynamics in Hexafluoroisopropanol Related to its Chemical Activity</title>

Hexafluoro&#8208;isopropanol (HFIP) is a popular solvent strongly enhancing reaction rates. Its unique properties are thought to be connected to its hydrogen&#8208;bond structure. Here we investigate the hydrogen&#8208;bond dynamics of HFIP and its non&#8208;fluorinated counterpart, isopropanol, by means of infrared and dielectric spectroscopy. We show that the smaller size and faster dynamics of hydrogen&#8208;bonded clusters in HFIP play an important role in its superior solvent properties.







Abstract
Using fluorinated mono&#8208;alcohols, in particular hexafluoro&#8208;isopropanol (HFIP), as a solvent can enhance chemical reaction rates in a spectacular manner. Previous work has shown evidence that this enhancement is related to the hydrogen&#8208;bond structure of these liquids. Here, we investigate the hydrogen&#8208;bond dynamics of HFIP and compare it to that of its non&#8208;fluorinated analog, isopropanol. Ultrafast infrared spectroscopy experiments show that the dynamics of individual hydrogen&#8208;bonds is about twice as slow in HFIP as in isopropanol. Surprisingly, from dielectric spectroscopy we find the opposite behavior for the dynamics of hydrogen&#8208;bonded clusters: collective rearrangements are 3&#8197;times faster in HFIP than in isopropanol. This difference indicates that the hydrogen&#8208;bonded clusters in HFIP are smaller than in isopropanol. The differences in cluster size can be traced to changes in the hydrogen&#8208;bond donor and acceptor strengths upon fluorination. The smaller cluster size can boost reaction rates in HFIP by increasing the concentration of reactive, terminal OH&#8208;groups of the clusters, whereas the fast collective dynamics can increase the rate of formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonds with the reactants. The longer lifetime of the individual hydrogen&#8208;bonds in HFIP can enhance the stability of the hydrogen&#8208;bonded clusters, and so increase the probability of reactant&#8208;solvent hydrogen&#8208;bonding.

         <title>The Fatal Mushroom Neurotoxin Muscarine is Released from a Harmless Phosphorylated Precursor upon Cellular Injury</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>

l&#8208;(+)&#8208;Muscarine is one of the most toxic mushroom metabolites. We identified its congener 4&#8217;&#8208;phosphomuscarine in the fool's funnel and in various fiber cap mushrooms, and chemically and pharmacologically characterized this new natural product. As hydrolysis of its ester releases muscarine, our results help estimate the true toxin content of these mushrooms.







Abstract
l&#8208;(+)&#8208;Muscarine (1)&#8208;producing mushrooms pose a severe threat to human health as ingestion can result in circulatory collapse or even death. However, their metabolic profile is surprisingly poorly understood, including knowledge of poison release and potentially toxic congeners. In the mycelium of the 1&#8208;producing fool's funnel mushroom Clitocybe rivulosa, we identified 4&#8217;&#8208;phosphomuscarine (2) as the major natural product. Its structure was elucidated by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and by comparison with a synthesized reference. We also detected this previously overlooked phosphorylated compound in the fiber cap mushrooms Pseudosperma spectrale and Inocybe nitidiuscula. Studies on the activation of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 indicate only weak affinity of 2 to this target. Furthermore, we present biological evidence that muscaridine (3), a quaternary amine congener related to and co&#8208;occurring with 1, does not activate the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 on human embryonic kidney cells. Our work provides important insight into the metabolic profile and the pharmacology of some of the most poisonous mushrooms. As the harmless 2 can liberate the potentially fatal 1 by unspecific enzymatic ester cleavage, these results are highly relevant for emergency medicine to estimate the true toxicity of these mushrooms.

On&#8208;surface synthesis of high&#8208;spin S=2 and S=3 nanographenes achieved through covalent linking of triangulenes via 1,3&#8208; and 1,3,5&#8208;phenylene spacers is reported. Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy, magnetic evidence of their degenerate ground states and an effective ferromagnetic inter&#8208;triangulene exchange is established. A spin model using a single coupling parameter describes magnetic excitations in both, the S=2 and S=3 nanographenes.

Cupric&#8208;(di)amine complexes, such as those made using n&#8208;butylamine, (&#8722;)&#8208;sparteine or its enantiomer, constitute versatile and complementary reagents for promoting the diverse regio&#8208; and atroposelective intramolecular dehydrogenative couplings of galloyl groups in chemical syntheses of glucopyranosic ellagitannins, such as tellimagrandin I and pedunculagin, and C&#8208;glucosidic ellagitannins, according to routes mimicking their postulated biosynthesis.







Abstract
Total syntheses of the C&#8208;glucosidic ellagitannins (&#8722;)&#8208;punicacortein A, (&#8722;)&#8208;epipunicacortein A and (+)&#8208;castalin were accomplished for the first time, and those of the glucopyranosic ellagitannins (+)&#8208;tellimagrandin I and (+)&#8208;pedunculagin were revisited. The atroposelective construction of their characteristic hexahydroxydiphenoyl (HHDP) and nonahydroxyterphenoyl (NHTP) units relied on the use of different cupric&#8208;amine complexes under different reaction conditions to mediate the intramolecular dehydrogenative coupling of galloyl groups at different positions of glucose cores. In particular, the monodentate n&#8208;butylamine and the bidentate (&#8722;)&#8208;sparteine were found to be complementary in their capacity to promote the regio&#8208; and atroposelective coupling of galloyl groups on a 4C1&#8208;glucopyranosic core into 2,3&#8208;O&#8208;(S)&#8208; and/or 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;(S)&#8208;HHDP units. Furthermore, replacing (&#8722;)&#8208;sparteine by its optical antipode not only counteracted the substrate&#8208;controlled induction of atroposelectivity to forge a 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;(R)&#8208;HHDP unit, but it also enabled a 4C1 to 1C4 ring flip of the glucopyranosic core and hence the formation of 2,4&#8208;O&#8208;(R)&#8208; and 3,6&#8208;O&#8208;(R)&#8208;HHDP units, such as those featured in the glucopyranosic ellagitannins phyllanemblinin B and geraniin.

         <title>Regiodivergent Functionalization of Protected and Unprotected Carbohydrates using Photoactive 4&#8208;Tetrafluoropyridinylthio Fragment as an Adaptive Activating Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general platform has been developed for the regiodivergent functionalization of both protected and unprotected carbohydrates by utilizing the electron&#8208;deficient thiyl fragment as a versatile and adaptive activating group. This method facilitates the efficient generation of carbon radicals at different saccharide sites, providing a valuable tool for the expeditous synthesis of a diverse array of high&#8208;value C&#8208;glycosides and rare sugars.







Abstract
The selective functionalization of carbohydrates holds a central position in synthetic carbohydrate chemistry, driving the ongoing quest for ideal approaches to manipulate these compounds. In this study, we introduce a general strategy that enables the regiodivergent functionalization of saccharides. The use of electron&#8208;deficient photoactive 4&#8208;tetrafluoropyridinylthio (SPyf) fragment as an adaptable activating group, facilitated efficient functionalization across all saccharide sites. More importantly, this activating group can be directly installed at the C1, C5 and C6 positions of biomass&#8208;derived carbohydrates in a single step and in a site&#8208;selective manner, allowing for the efficient and precision&#8208;oriented modification of unprotected saccharides and glycans.

         <title>Highly Durable Inverted Inorganic Perovskite/Organic Tandem Solar Cells Enabled by Multifunctional Additives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two multifunctional additives of AQS&#8201;:&#8201;FPMA and AQS&#8201;:&#8201;FPEA are developed to suppress the voltage loss of inverted inorganic perovskite solar cells of 1.78&#8197;eV and construct highly efficient and durable inverted inorganic perovskite/organic tandem solar cells. The formation of AQS&#8208;involved intermediate phase regulate the crystalliztaion rate resulting in lower defects of inorganic perovskites. Moreover, the benchmark of T90 lifetime of perovskite/organic tandem solar cells under MPPT can be promoted to 1000&#8197;h, which will facilitate the real&#8208;world deployment.







Abstract
Inverted perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (P/O TSCs) suffer from poor long&#8208;term device stability due to halide segregation in organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid wide&#8208;band gap (WBG) perovskites, which hinders their practical deployment. Therefore, developing all&#8208;inorganic WBG perovskites for incorporation into P/O TSCs is a promising strategy because of their superior stability under continuous illumination. However, these inorganic WBG perovskites also face some critical issues, including rapid crystallization, phase instability, and large energy loss, etc. To tackle these issues, two multifunctional additives based on 9,10&#8208;anthraquinone&#8208;2&#8208;sulfonic acid (AQS) are developed to regulate the perovskite crystallization by mediating the intermediate phases and suppress the halide segregation through the redox&#8208;shuttle effect. By coupling with organic cations having the desirable functional groups and dipole moments, these additives can effectively passivate the defects and adjust the alignment of interface energy levels. Consequently, a record Voc approaching 1.3&#8197;V with high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.59&#8201;% could be achieved in a 1.78&#8197;eV band gap single&#8208;junction inverted all&#8208;inorganic PSC. More importantly, the P/O TSC derived from this cell demonstrates a T90 lifetime of 1000&#8197;h under continuous operation, presenting the most stable P/O TSCs reported so far.

         <title>Customized Heteronuclear Dual Single&#8208;Atom and Cluster Assemblies via D&#8208;Band Orchestration for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proactive cluster lockdown strategy is employed for the targeted synthesis of multicomponent ensemble catalysts featuring dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom and atomic cluster configurations for oxygen reduction reaction. The evolved configurations orchestrate hybridization between dz2&#8208;dxz and O 2p orbitals near the Fermi level, optimizing antibonding states to expedite OH* desorption and foster efficient OOH* generation, ultimately boosting catalytic activity.







Abstract
Advanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts, integrating with well&#8208;dispersed single atom (SA) and atomic cluster (AC) sites, showcase potential in bolstering catalytic activity. However, the precise structural modulation and in&#8208;depth investigation of their catalytic mechanisms pose ongoing challenges. Herein, a proactive cluster lockdown strategy is introduced, relying on the confinement of trinuclear clusters with metal atom exchange in the covalent organic polymers, enabling the targeted synthesis of a series of multicomponent ensembles featuring FeCo (Fe or Co) dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom (DSA) and atomic cluster (AC) configurations (FeCo&#8208;DSA/AC) via thermal pyrolysis. The designed FeCo&#8208;DSA/AC surpasses Fe&#8208; and Co&#8208;derived counterparts by 18&#8197;mV and 49&#8197;mV in ORR half&#8208;wave potential, whilst exhibiting exemplary performance in Zn&#8208;air batteries. Comprehensive analysis and theoretical simulation elucidate the enhanced activity stems from adeptly orchestrating dz2&#8208;dxz and O 2p orbital hybridization proximate to the Fermi level, fine&#8208;tuning the antibonding states to expedite OH* desorption and OOH* formation, thereby augmenting catalytic activity. This work elucidates the synergistic potentiation of active sites in hybrid electrocatalysts, pioneering innovative targeted design strategies for single&#8208;atom&#8208;cluster electrocatalysts.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Engineering&#8208;Assisted Ligand Exchange Strategy for High&#8208;Efficiency AgBiS2 Quantum Dot Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface chemistry of colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) plays a critical role in CQD solar cells. Here, a solvent engineering strategy is proposed to optimize the solid&#8208;state ligand exchange process. This strategy enables improved AgBiS2 CQD films, leading to solar cells with power conversion efficiency of 25&#8201;% higher than that of the control one, as well as enhanced stability.







Abstract
As the initial synthesized colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are generally capped with insulating ligands, ligand exchange strategies are essential in the fabrication of CQD films for solar cells, which can regulate the surface chemical states of CQDs to make them more suitable for thin&#8208;film optoelectronic devices. However, uncontrollable surface adsorption of water molecules during the ligand exchange process introduces new defect sites, thereby impairing the resultant device performance, which attracts more efforts devoted to it but remains a puzzle. Here, we develop a solvent&#8208;engineering&#8208;assisted ligand exchange strategy to revamp the surface adsorption, improve the exchange efficiency, and modulate the surface chemistry for the environmentally friendly lead&#8208;free silver bismuth disulfide (AgBiS2) CQDs. The optimized AgBiS2 CQD solar cells deliver an outstanding champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 8.95&#8201;% and improved long&#8208;term stability. Our strategy is less environment&#8208;dependent and can produce solar cells with negligible performance variance for several batches across several months. Our work demonstrates the critical role of solvents for ligand exchange in the surface chemistry of CQDs and the realization of high&#8208;performance photovoltaic devices in a highly reproducible manner.

The green crystals formed in the reduction of AriPr8AlI2 (AriPr8=C6H&#8208;2,6&#8208;(C6H2&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;iPr3)2&#8208;3,5&#8208;iPr2) with Na on NaCl were shown to contain the free dialuminene AriPr8AlAlAriPr8 that forms alongside the previously characterized yellow crystals of the alanediyl :AlAriPr8. The interplay between :AlAriPr8 and AriPr8AlAlAriPr8 in solution was examined in detail with small molecule activation studies and computational methods.







Abstract
Careful analysis of the crystals formed in the reduction of AriPr8AlI2 (AriPr8=C6H&#8208;2,6&#8208;(C6H2&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;iPr3)2&#8208;3,5&#8208;iPr2) with sodium on sodium chloride showed them to contain the long sought&#8208;after dialuminene AriPr8AlAlAriPr8 (1) that forms alongside the previously characterized alanediyl :AlAriPr8. The single crystal X&#8208;ray structure of 1 revealed a nearly planar, trans&#8208;bent C(ipso)AlAlC(ipso) core with an Al&#8722;Al distance of 2.648(2)&#8197;&#197;. The molecular and electronic structure of 1 are consistent with an Al&#8722;Al double dative interaction augmented with diradical character and stabilized by dispersion interactions. Density functional theory calculations showed that the reactivity of :AlAriPr8 with dihydrogen involves 1, not :AlAriPr8, as the reactive species. In contrast, the reaction of :AlAriPr8 with ethylene gave two products, the 1,4&#8208;dialuminacyclohexane AriPr8Al(C2H4)2AlAriPr8 (2) and the aluminacyclopentane AriPr8Al(C4H8) (3), that can both form from the aluminacyclopropane intermediate AriPr8Al(C2H4). Although the [2+2+2] cycloaddition of 1 with two equivalents of ethylene was also calculated to be exergonic, it is likely to be kinetically blocked by the numerous isopropyl substituents surrounding the Al&#8722;Al bond. Attempts to fine&#8208;tune the steric bulk of the terphenyl ligand to allow stronger Al&#8722;Al bonding were unsuccessful, leading to the isolation of the sodium salt of a cyclotrialuminene, Na2[AlAriPr6]3 (4), instead of AriPr6AlAlAriPr6.

         <title>Dilute Pd&#8722;Ni Alloy through Low&#8208;temperature Pyrolysis for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient dilute Pd&#8722;Ni alloy HOR electrocatalyst has been developed from a Pd&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;based coordination polymer through low&#8208;temperature pyrolysis. This work offers new perspectives for designing more advanced electrocatalysts for energy conversion.







Abstract
Designing highly active and cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts for the alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is critical for advancing anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs). While dilute metal alloys have demonstrated substantial potential in enhancing alkaline HOR performance, there has been limited exploration in terms of rational design, controllable synthesis, and mechanism study. Herein, we developed a series of dilute Pd&#8722;Ni alloys, denoted as x% Pd&#8722;Ni, based on a trace&#8208;Pd decorated Ni&#8208;based coordination polymer through a facile low&#8208;temperature pyrolysis approach. The x% Pd&#8722;Ni alloys exhibit efficient electrocatalytic activity for HOR in alkaline media. Notably, the optimal 0.5&#8201;% Pd&#8722;Ni catalyst demonstrates high intrinsic activity with an exchange current density of 0.055&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, surpassing that of many other alkaline HOR catalysts. The mechanism study reveals that the strong synergy between Pd single atoms (SAs)/Pd dimer and Ni substrate can modulate the binding strength of proton (H)/hydroxyl (OH), thereby significantly reducing the activation energy barrier of a decisive reaction step. This work offers new insights into designing advanced dilute metal or single&#8208;atom&#8208;alloys (SAAs) for alkaline HOR and potentially other energy conversion processes.

         <title>Interface Energy&#8208;Level Reorganization for Efficient Perovskite &#947;&#8208;Ray Detectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface molecular engineering of perovskites is used to adjust energy levels and block leakage currents from deficient contact barriers under high bias voltage. In this work, detectors treated with strong dipole ligands show enhanced energy resolution (3.9&#8201;% for 22Na 511&#8197;keV &#947;&#8208;rays at room temperature) and remain stable under a continuous electric field for over 300&#8197;minutes.







Abstract
Metal halide perovskites are promising candidates for gamma&#8208;ray (&#947;&#8208;ray) spectrum detectors. However, achieving high&#8208;resolution energy spectra in single&#8208;photon pulse&#8208;height analysis mode remains challenging, due to the inevitable leakage currents degrade the recognizable fingerprint energies which is critical for resolving &#947;&#8208;ray spectroscopy. We demonstrate under high bias voltage, a deficient contact barrier can lead to excessive surface charge injection, thereby increasing leakage current from electrodes to perovskites. Hence, we conceive to employ surface ligand engineering on perovskite single crystals to manipulate energy levels to suppress leakage current. In particular, anchoring a strong dipole ligand onto the perovskite induced surface charge&#8208;density displacement, leading to a downward band bending and heightened the corresponding contact barrier. Consequently, the strategy minimized the detectors&#8217; leakage current by an order of magnitude, to as low as 44&#8197;nA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;100&#8197;V. The resulting detectors show a significant improvement in energy resolution, 3.9&#8201;% for 22Na 511&#8197;keV &#947;&#8208;rays has been achieved at room temperature. The resulting detector further resolves each fingerprint energy for 152Eu &#947;&#8208;spectrum, representing one of the best &#947;&#8208;rays perovskite detectors reported to date. Moreover, the detectors exhibited stabilized energy resolution without any degradation under a continuous electric field (1,000&#8197;V&#8201;cm&#8722;1) for over 300&#8197;minutes, representing the longest longevity reported to date.

         <title>A Protocol for Unveiling the Nature of Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reactions: True Water Splitting or Sacrificial Reagent Acceptorless Dehydrogenation?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proton source for photocatalytic H2 evolution in the presence of sacrificial reagents (SRs) is comprehensively investigated. Water is found to act as a proton shuttle as its amount remains constant during the course of the reaction. The results also demonstrate the importance of identifying the products of the often&#8208;complicated oxidation processes, as the potential value&#8208;added oxidation products might be even more interesting than the hydrogen produced.







Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen evolution is a highly topical subject in academic research and a promising approach for sustainable fuel production from solar energy. Due to the mismatched energy diagram of the photosensitizer (especially semiconductor&#8208;based materials where band&#8208;edge engineering is not trivial) and the redox potential of the half&#8208;reactions of water splitting, photocatalytic H2 generation from water splitting is usually accelerated by the addition of hole scavengers, i.e. sacrificial reagents such as alcohols, amines, and thiols. However, the source of the protons of the evolved H2 is often neglected, and it is questionable whether such systems are really water splitting. Here, we discuss recent reports on sacrificial reagent&#8208;assisted photocatalytic water splitting and present our recent findings, which showcase that the sacrificial reagent in the investigated photocatalytic water splitting systems inherently undergoes acceptorless dehydrogenation, with H2O serving as the proton shuttle, the amount of which doesn't change during the course of the reaction.

However, the source of the protons of the evolved H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is often neglected, and it is questionable whether such systems are really water splitting. Here, we discuss recent reports on sacrificial reagent-assisted photocatalytic water splitting and present our recent findings, which showcase that the sacrificial reagent in the investigated photocatalytic water splitting systems inherently undergoes acceptorless dehydrogenation, with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O serving as the proton shuttle, the amount of which doesn't change during the course of the reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Core fucosylation , catalyzed by &#945;&#8208;1,6&#8208;fucosyltransferase (FUT8), is implicated in various diseases, making FUT8 inhibitors highly desirable. In their Research Article (e202414682), Yoshiyuki Manabe, Koichi Fukase et&#8197;al. developed FUT8 inhibitors with potent cellular activity. Through high&#8208;throughput screening and structural optimization, potent FUT8 inhibitors were identified. Additionally, prodrug derivatization enhanced the stability of these inhibitors, enabling the suppression of core fucose expression in cell&#8208;based assays.

Chemical bonds in dye molecules are vibrationally excited by a narrowband mid&#8208;IR pulse and upconverted by a synchronized near&#8208;IR pulse. Doubly excited molecules emit fluorescence encoding mid&#8208;IR information. This bond&#8208;selective fluorescence&#8208;detected IR&#8208;excited (BonFIRE) method allows wide&#8208;field single&#8208;molecule mid&#8208;IR imaging and spectral profiling at room temperature, for robust characterization of polarization, peak position, linewidth, and vibrational relaxation, as reported by Lu Wei et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202413647).

Rare earth (RE) elements are attractive for spin&#8208;magnetic modulation due to their unique 4f electron configuration and strong orbital couplings. In their Research Article (e202412591), Chao Gu, Yaping Du et&#8197;al. define a solid&#8208;phase synthetic protocol for creating RE&#8208;3d transition metal&#8211;noble metal integrated intraparticle heterostructured nanoalloys with distinct Gd and Co interface within the entire Rh framework. They exhibit interface&#8208;triggered antiferromagnetic interaction, which can induce electron redistribution and regulate spin polarization.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the unique modifications of prenyl side chains involved in natural product biosynthesis, including epoxidation, dehydrogenation, oxidation of methyl groups to carboxyl groups, C&#8722;C bond cleavage and oxidative cyclization.







Abstract
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in understanding the enzymatic machinery responsible for the modifications of prenyl side chains and elucidating their roles in natural product biosynthesis. This interest stems from the pivotal role such modifications play in shaping the structural and functional diversity of natural products, as well as from their potential applications to synthetic biology and drug discovery. In addition to contributing to the diversity and complexity of natural products, unique modifications of prenyl side chains are represented by several novel biosynthetic mechanisms. Representative unique examples of epoxidation, dehydrogenation, oxidation of methyl groups to carboxyl groups, unusual C&#8722;C bond cleavage and oxidative cyclization are summarized and discussed. By revealing the intriguing chemistry and enzymology behind these transformations, this comprehensive and comparative review will guide future efforts in the discovery, characterization and application of modifications of prenyl side chains in natural product biosynthesis.

         <title>Hydrogenation Reactions with Heterobimetallic Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview describes the development of heterobimetallic homogeneous catalysts for the hydrogenation of unsaturated substrates including alkenes, alkynes, and ketones. These examples highlight the benefits of metal&#8208;metal cooperativity, which can arise from the activation of molecular hydrogen across two different metal centers, bimetallic product elimination steps, and the tuning of electronic properties through metal&#8208;metal communication.







Abstract
Hydrogenations are fundamentally and industrially important reactions that are atom economical paths to synthesize value&#8208;added products from feedstock chemicals. The cooperative effects of two or more metal centers in multimetallic active sites is a successful strategy to activate small molecules and facilitate catalytic reactions, and this strategy has been recently applied to catalytic hydrogenation reactions. Furthermore, heterobimetallic complexes have been well&#8208;documented to provide novel reaction pathways and improved selectivity, compared to their homo&#8208;bimetallic and monometallic analogues. This minireview provides a historical perspective on the development of heterobimetallic catalysts for the hydrogenation of unsaturated substrates and describes recent developments in this burgeoning research area.

         <title>Polymerization&#8208;induced Chiral Self&#8208;assembly for the In situ Construction, Modulation, Amplification and Applications of Asymmetric Suprastructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymerization&#8208;induced chiral self&#8208;assembly offers a powerful method to in situ construct, modulate, amplify the asymmetric suprastructures. Further design of novel helical polymers requires exploring new PICSA systems, exploiting the multiple effects of asymmetric amplification discussed in Section&#8197;3, and designing appropriate building blocks to obtain stable binding strengths.







Abstract
In the polymerization&#8208;induced chiral self&#8208;assembly (PICSA) process, chiral functional monomers undergo spontaneous supramolecular self&#8208;assembly and asymmetric stacking during living polymerization, leading to the in situ generation of chiroptical polymer assemblies characterized by diverse morphologies. The PICSA strategy facilitates precise control and manipulation of both non&#8208;covalent supramolecular helices and covalent macromolecular helices within aggregated cores, thereby driving significant advancements in fields such as chiral recognition materials, asymmetric catalysts, nonlinear optical materials, and ferroelectric liquid crystals (LC). This minireview summarizes recent developments in the in situ chiroptical construction and modulation associated with the PICSA methodology. Furthermore, it seeks to elucidate emerging PICSA systems founded on various living polymerization mechanisms, exploring hierarchical chirality transfer processes and the pathway complexities in both equilibrium and non&#8208;equilibrium conditions. This minireview also presents several illustrative examples that demonstrate the practical applications of chiral polymer materials synthesized through the PICSA approach, thereby illuminating future opportunities in this innovative field.

         <title>Proton Relays in Molecular Catalysis for Hydrogen Evolution and Oxidation: Lessons From the Mimicry of Hydrogenases and Electrochemical Kinetic Analyses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the role of proton relays at the active sites of hydrogenases, highlighting their significance in hydrogen evolution and oxidation. It then explores biomimetic and bioinspired systems containing such proton relays from the literature, discusses the electrochemical framework for enhancing catalysis, and identifies key parameters for achieving bidirectional and reversible catalysis.







Abstract
The active sites of metalloenzymes involved in small molecules activation often contain pendant bases that act as proton relay promoting proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer processes. Here we focus on hydrogenases and on the reactions they catalyze, i.&#8201;e. the hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions. After a short description of these enzymes, we review some of the various biomimetic and bioinspired molecular systems that contain proton relays. We then provide the formal electrochemical framework required to decipher the key role of such proton relay to enhance catalysis in a single direction and discuss the few systems active for H2 evolution for which quantitative kinetic data are available. We finally highlight key parameters required to reach bidirectional catalysis (both hydrogen evolution and hydrogen oxidation catalyzed) and then transition to reversible catalysis (both reactions catalyzed in a narrow potential range) as well as illustrate these features on few systems from the literature.

         <title>Pairing Oxygen Reduction and Water Oxidation for Dual&#8208;Pathway H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a nexus chemical which has various industrial applications. Nevertheless, its current industrial process is carbon&#8208;intensive. Pairing two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction (2e&#8722; ORR) with two&#8208;electron water oxidation (2e&#8722; WOR) reaction is a green process for H2O2 synthesis. This review offers a perspective on catalysts integrating 2e&#8722; ORR and 2e&#8722; WOR reactions for dual&#8208;pathway H2O2 synthesis driven by sunlight and electricity.







Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a crucial chemical applied in various industry sectors. However, the current industrial anthraquinone process for H2O2 synthesis is carbon&#8208;intensive. With sunlight and renewable electricity as energy inputs, photocatalysis and electrocatalysis have great potential for green H2O2 production from oxygen (O2) and water (H2O). Herein, we review the advances in pairing two&#8208;electron O2 reduction and two&#8208;electron H2O oxidation reactions for dual&#8208;pathway H2O2 synthesis. The basic principles, paired redox reactions, and catalytic device configurations are introduced initially. Aligning with the energy input, the latest photocatalysts, electrocatalysts, and photo&#8208;electrocatalysts for dual&#8208;pathway H2O2 production are discussed afterward. Finally, we outlook the research opportunities in the future. This minireview aims to provide insights and guidelines for the broad community who are interested in catalyst design and innovative technology for on&#8208;site H2O2 synthesis.

Pairing two-electron oxygen reduction (2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR) with two-electron water oxidation (2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; WOR) reaction is a green process for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis. This review offers a perspective on catalysts integrating 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR and 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; WOR reactions for dual-pathway H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis driven by sunlight and electricity.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is a crucial chemical applied in various industry sectors. However, the current industrial anthraquinone process for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis is carbon-intensive. With sunlight and renewable electricity as energy inputs, photocatalysis and electrocatalysis have great potential for green H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production from oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). Herein, we review the advances in pairing two-electron O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction and two-electron H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O oxidation reactions for dual-pathway H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis. The basic principles, paired redox reactions, and catalytic device configurations are introduced initially. Aligning with the energy input, the latest photocatalysts, electrocatalysts, and photo-electrocatalysts for dual-pathway H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production are discussed afterward. Finally, we outlook the research opportunities in the future. This minireview aims to provide insights and guidelines for the broad community who are interested in catalyst design and innovative technology for on-site H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unprecedented Silver&#8208;Based Hybrid Pyroelectric Enabling Wide Spectral Photo&#8208;Pyroelectricity for Birefringence Photomodulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the first silver&#8208;based hybrid pyroelectric that enables wide spectral light&#8208;induced pyroelectricity, serving as a new pathway to modulate birefringence with the highest level of ~1.68&#215;10&#8722;2. This work sheds light on the future advance of smart optical and optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
Birefringent crystal, which has the capacity to manipulate polarization light, holds an indispensable position in optics and optoelectronics, while it remains challenging to fulfill the modulation of birefringence. Here, we present wide spectral photo&#8208;pyroelectric effect in a silver&#8208;based hybrid pyroelectric, (N&#8208;CHM)Ag2I3 (N&#8208;CHM=N&#8208;cyclohexylmethylamine), serving as a feasible strategy to regulate birefringence through light stimuli. As the first silver&#8208;based hybrid pyroelectric, (N&#8208;CHM)Ag2I3 exhibits strong room&#8208;temperature photo&#8208;pyroelectricity with a large polarization of ~3.23&#8197;&#956;C/cm2 and high voltage responsivity of ~0.96&#8197;m2/C across the UV&#8211;NIR spectral region. Strikingly, the photomodulation of its in&#8208;plane birefringence is established through pyroelectric effect, giving a saturation value of ~1.68&#215;10&#8722;2 that is among the highest level achieved to date. This study on the birefringence photomodulation of lead&#8208;free hybrid pyroelectric is anticipated to boost future development of new smart optical and optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Full&#8208;Spectrum Light&#8208;Harvesting Solar Thermal Electrocatalyst Boosts Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct integration of full&#8208;spectrum solar thermal conversion (STC) and high electrocatalytic oxygen evolution activity is achieved by fabricating a hierarchical nanocage architecture composed of graphene&#8208;encapsulated CoNi nanoparticle, delivering a near&#8208;complete 98&#8201;% absorptivity of solar spectrum and a high STC efficiency of 97&#8201;%, enabling a remarkable potential decrease of over 240&#8197;mV in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution under solar illumination.







Abstract
Enabling high&#8208;efficiency solar thermal conversion (STC) at catalytic active site is critical but challenging for harnessing solar energy to boost catalytic reactions. Herein, we report the direct integration of full&#8208;spectrum STC and high electrocatalytic oxygen evolution activity by fabricating a hierarchical nanocage architecture composed of graphene&#8208;encapsulated CoNi nanoparticle. This catalyst exhibits a near&#8208;complete 98&#8201;% absorptivity of solar spectrum and a high STC efficiency of 97&#8201;%, which is superior than previous solar thermal catalytic materials. It delivers a remarkable potential decrease of over 240&#8197;mV at various current densities for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution under solar illumination, which is practically unachievable via traditionally heating the system. The high&#8208;efficiency STC is enabled by a synergy between the regulated electronic structure of graphene via CoNi&#8208;carbon interaction and the multiple absorption of lights by the light&#8208;trapping nanocage. Theoretical calculations suggest that high temperature&#8208;induced vibrational free energy gain promotes the potential&#8208;limiting *O to *OOH step, which decreases the overpotential for oxygen evolution.

         <title>Selective Cross&#8208;Metathesis Versus Ring&#8208;Closing Metathesis of Terpenes, Taking the Path Less Travelled</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,6&#8208;Heptadiene substrates readily ring&#8208;close to form thermodynamically stable five&#8208;membered rings in the presence of metathesis catalysts. However, the unique selectivity displayed by Ru&#8722;SCF3&#8722;I provides a distinct cross&#8208;metathesis pathway with various prenylated 1,6&#8208;heptadienes, including terpenes. This new methodology presents a promising opportunity for the modification of biologically active compounds.







Abstract
A diiodo ruthenium olefin metathesis pre&#8208;catalyst was employed to achieve remarkably selective cross&#8208;metathesis reactions of prenylated 1,6&#8208;dienes, effectively overcoming the entropically favored intramolecular ring&#8208;closing metathesis. This reaction was investigated using Density Functional Theory (DFT) computations and fine&#8208;tuned through the application of a Design of Experiments (DoE) approach. The potential of this innovative process was demonstrated through the unprecedented functionalization of various terpene natural products via cross&#8208;metathesis, resulting in the synthesis of new derivatives in a single step.

         <title>Why Mg2IrH6 Is Predicted to Be a High&#8208;Temperature Superconductor, But Ca2IrH6 Is Not</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In Mg2IrH6, a predicted high temperature superconductor, the superconductivity results from the vibrations of the IrH64&#8722; molecules, whose eg* states are found near the Fermi level. In stark contrast, in Ca2IrH6 superconductivity is quenched via IrH64&#8722;&#8594;Ca d back&#8208;donation, as evidenced by a plot of the charge density of the occupied part of the metallic band, with contributions around Ca (yellow tetrahedra) and the molecular anion (blue octahedra).







Abstract
The X2MH6 family, consisting of an electropositive cation Xn+ and a main group metal M octahedrally coordinated by hydrogen, have been identified as promising templates for high&#8208;temperature conventional superconductivity. Herein, we analyze the electronic structure of two members of this family, Mg2IrH6 and Ca2IrH6, showing why the former may possess superconducting properties rivaling those of the cuprates, whereas the latter does not. Within Mg2IrH6 the vibrations of the anions IrH64&#8722; anions are key for the superconducting mechanism, and they induce coupling in the 

eg*

 ${e_g^{\ast} }$



 set of orbitals, which are antibonding between the H 1s and the Ir 

dx2-y2

 ${d_{x^2 - y^2 } }$



 or 

dz2

 ${d_{z^2 } }$



 orbitals. Because calcium possesses low&#8208;lying d&#8208;orbitals, 

eg*

 ${e_g^{\ast} }$



&#8594;Ca d back&#8208;donation is preferred, quenching the superconductivity. Our analysis explains why high critical temperatures were only predicted for second or third row X metal atoms, and may provide rules for identifying likely high&#8208;temperature superconductors in other systems where the antibonding anionic states are filled.

         <title>Catalytic Promiscuity of Fatty Acid Photodecarboxylase Enables Stereoselective Synthesis of Chiral &#945;&#8208;Tetralones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;natural reductive dehalogenation (deacetoxylation) reactivity of fatty acid photodecarboxylase (CvFAP) was reported for the first time, providing an efficient approach for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral &#945;&#8208;substituted tetralones. The native photoenzyme catalyzed the reductive dehalogenation via a novel mechanism involving FADox/FADsq redox pair and an ET/PT process of radical termination, which was distinct from previous reports.







Abstract
In the field of biocatalysis, discovering novel reactivity from known enzymes has been a longstanding challenge. Fatty acid photo&#8208;decarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis (CvFAP) has drawn considerable attention as a promising photoenzyme with potential green chemistry applications; however, its non&#8208;natural reactivity has rarely been exploited to date. Herein we report a non&#8208;natural reductive dehalogenation (deacetoxylation) reactivity of CvFAP inspired by its natural oxidative decarboxylation process, enabling the stereoselective synthesis of a series of chiral &#945;&#8208;substituted tetralones with high yields (up to 99&#8201;%) and e.r. values (up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1). Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the native photoenzyme catalyzed the reductive dehalogenation via a novel mechanism involving oxidized state (FADox)/semiquinone state (FADsq) redox pair and an electron transfer (ET)/proton transfer (PT) process of radical termination, distinct from the previous reports. To our knowledge, this study represents a new example of CvFAP promiscuity, and thus expands the reactivity repertoire of CvFAP and highlights the versatility of CvFAP in asymmetric synthesis.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Construction of Functional Multi&#8208;Dimensional MXene&#8208;based Composites Directly from MAX Phases through Gas&#8208;Solid Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ construction of functional multi&#8208;dimensional MXene&#8208;based composites with versatile architectures is first realized directly from MAX phases through a general and efficient gas&#8208;solid reaction, for electrochemical applications, especially the durable lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries, thanks to appealing synergistic effects induced by the involved components.







Abstract
The weak bonding of A atoms with MX layers in MAX phases not only enables the selective etching of A layers for MXene preparation but brings about the chance to construct A derivatives/MXene composites via in situ conversion. Here, a facile and general gas&#8208;solid reaction systems are elegantly devised to construct multi&#8208;dimensional MXene based composites including AlF3 nanorods/MXene, AlF3 nanocrystals/MXene, amorphous AlF3/MXene, A filled carbon nanotubes/MXene, layered metal chalcogenides/MXene, MOF/MXene, and so on. The intrinsic effect mechanism of interlayer confinement towards crystal growth, catalytic behavior, van der Waals&#8208;heterostructure construction and coordination reaction are rationally put forward. The tight interface combination and synergistic effect from distinct components make them promising active materials for electrochemical applications. More particularly, the AlF3 nanorods/Nb2C MXene demonstrate bi&#8208;directional catalytic activity toward the conversion between Li2S and lithium polysulfides, which alleviates the shuttle effect in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Selective Catalytic Combustion of Hydrogen under Aerobic Conditions on Na2WO4/SiO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na2WO4/SiO2, a formulation known to be active for the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM), catalyzes selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) in H2&#8208;hydrocarbon&#8208;O2 mixtures at 873&#8211;983&#8197;K, with H2 combustion kinetics dependent only on the hydrogen partial pressure. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction demonstrate that the Na2WO4 phase is disordered under reaction conditions, even at temperatures below the bulk Na2WO4 melting point.







Abstract
Na2WO4/SiO2, a material known to catalyze alkane selective oxidation including the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM), is demonstrated to catalyze selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) with &gt;97&#8201;% selectivity in mixtures with several hydrocarbons (CH4, C2H6, C2H4, C3H6, C6H6) in the presence of gas&#8208;phase dioxygen at 883&#8211;983&#8197;K. Hydrogen combustion rates exhibit a near&#8208;first&#8208;order dependence on H2 partial pressure and are zero&#8208;order in H2O and O2 partial pressures. Mechanistic studies at 923&#8197;K using isotopically&#8208;labeled reagents demonstrate the kinetic relevance of H&#8722;H dissociation and absence of O&#8208;atom recombination. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and W LIII&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) studies demonstrate, respectively, a loss of Na2WO4 crystallinity and lack of second&#8208;shell coordination with respect to W6+ cations below 923&#8197;K; benchmark experiments show that alkali cations must be present for the material to be selective for hydrogen combustion, but that materials containing Na alone have much lower combustion rates (per gram Na) than those containing Na and W. These data suggest a synergy between Na and W in a disordered phase at temperatures below the bulk melting point of Na2WO4 (971&#8197;K) during SHC catalysis. The Na2WO4/SiO2 SHC catalyst maintains stable combustion rates at temperatures ca. 100&#8197;K higher than redox&#8208;active SHC catalysts and could potentially enable enhanced olefin yields in tandem operation of reactors combining alkane dehydrogenation with SHC processes.

         <title>An Organometallic Umpolung Approach for Iron&#8208;Mediated Propargylic C&#8722;H Etherification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Fe&#8208;mediated reaction couples alkynes and alcohols to give propargylic ethers. This three&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot protocol is applicable to complex, heteroatom&#8208;rich substrates to deliver propargylic ethers in a highly chemoselective manner.







Abstract
Propargylic ethers serve as useful intermediates for the synthesis of a variety of complex targets. However, propargylic substitution of prefunctionalized alkyne starting materials remains the dominant method for the synthesis of propargyl ethers, while direct etherification of simple alkynes via propargylic C&#8722;H functionalization remains largely underreported. Herein, we report an organometallic umpolung approach for iron&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H propargylic etherification. A telescopic protocol for iron&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H deprotonation followed by mild oxidative coupling with alcohols enabled the use of simple or functionalized alkynes for the expedient synthesis of propargylic ethers with excellent functional group compatibility, chemoselectivity and regioselectivity.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Purpose Non&#8208;Canonical Amino Acid for the Expanded Genetic Code: Combining Metal&#8208;Binding and Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genetic code expansion strategies tend to incorporate non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) with singular, specialised functions into proteins. In this study, a dual&#8208;purpose ncAA that can undergo inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEEDA) reactions and coordinate luminogenic metal complexes was designed, synthesised, and incorporated into a protein. Significantly, luminescence studies revealed emission shifts upon dual functionalisation.







Abstract
A rationally designed dual&#8208;purpose non&#8208;canonical amino acid (Trz) has been synthesised and successfully incorporated into a protein scaffold by genetic code expansion. Trz contains a 5&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazine system, which allows for inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reactions to occur on the triazine ring and for metal ions to be chelated both before and after the click reaction. Trz was successfully incorporated into a protein scaffold and the IEDDA utility of Trz demonstrated through the site&#8208;specific labelling of the purified protein with a bicyclononyne. Additionally, Trz was shown to successfully coordinate a cyclometallated iridium(III) centre, providing access to a bioorthogonal luminogenic probe. The luminescent properties of the Ir(III)&#8208;bound protein blue&#8208;shift upon IEDDA click reaction with bicyclononyne, providing a unique method for monitoring the extent and location of the labelling reaction. In summary, Trz is a new dual&#8208;purpose non&#8208;canonical amino acid with great potential for myriad bioapplications where metal&#8208;based functionality is required, for example in imaging, catalysis, and photo&#8208;dynamic therapy, in conjunction with a bioorthogonal reactive handle to impart additional functionalities, such as dual&#8208;modality imaging or therapeutic payloads.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Induced Division of Polymersomes for Biomimetic Compartmentalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymersomes, synthetic vesicles mimicking cellular compartments, enable the creation of cell&#8208;like chemical systems such as microreactors and synthetic organelles. We report multicompartment polymersomes with a vesicle&#8208;in&#8208;vesicle architecture formed through self&#8208;division, driven by the pH&#8208;triggered incorporation of a phenylalanine&#8208;phenylalanine&#8208;methionine tripeptide into the membrane. This process produces internal vesicles that colocalize enzymes, offering a method for engineering adaptive microreactors.







Abstract
Polymersomes are synthetic vesicles that mimic the architecture of cellular compartments such as the cell membrane and organelles. These biomimetic compartments facilitate the creation of cell&#8208;like chemical systems, including microreactors and synthetic organelles. However, the construction of hierarchical multi&#8208;compartment systems remains challenging and typically requires the encapsulation of pre&#8208;formed vesicles within a host compartment. Here, we report the formation of multicompartment polymersomes with a vesicle&#8208;in&#8208;vesicle architecture achieved through self&#8208;division induced by short peptides incorporated into the vesicle membrane. A phenylalanine&#8208;phenylalanine&#8208;methionine (FFM) tripeptide was designed and encapsulated into the polymersome via microfluidics. We demonstrate that vesicle self&#8208;division occurs due to peptide incorporation into the membrane in response to pH&#8197;changes. This self&#8208;division creates internal vesicles capable of colocalizing enzymes. The hybrid polymer&#8208;peptide system described here provides a straightforward method for developing subcompartmentalized systems, paving the way for engineering microreactors with life&#8208;like properties.

         <title>Hydrazine&#8208;Catalysed Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization Of Cyclobutenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient metal&#8208;free ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization of cyclobutenes using hydrazine catalysis is described. The polymerizations proceed with high stereoselectivity and show living characteristics, achieving excellent control over molecular weight, and low dispersity values.







Abstract
Materials formed by the ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of cyclic olefins are highly valued for industrial and academic applications but are difficult to prepare free of metal contaminants. Here we describe a highly efficient metal&#8208;free ROMP of cyclobutenes using hydrazine catalysis. Reactions can be initiated via in situ condensation of a [2.2.2]&#8208;bicyclic hydrazine catalyst with an aliphatic or aromatic aldehyde initiator. The polymerizations show living characteristics, achieving excellent control over molecular weight, low dispersity values, and high chain&#8208;end fidelity. Additionally, the hydrazine can be used in substoichiometric amounts relative to the aldehyde chain&#8208;end while maintaining good control over molecular weight and low dispersity values, indicating that a highly efficient chain transfer mechanism is occurring.

         <title>Carbon Nanoparticle Oxidation by NO2 and O2: Chemical Kinetics and Reaction Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a kinetic multilayer model and comprehensive experimental data, this study investigates the oxidation of carbon nanoparticles by NO2 and O2 under combustion exhaust conditions, going beyond traditional shrinking core modelling approaches. The study develops a molecular picture of the reaction system, including a reference chemical reaction mechanisms and energy profiles for three alternative reaction pathways.







Abstract
Carbon nanoparticle interactions with gases are central to many environmental and technical processes, but the underlying reaction kinetics and mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we investigate the oxidation and gasification of carbon nanoparticles by NO2 and O2 under combustion exhaust conditions. We build on a comprehensive experimental data set and use a kinetic multilayer model (KM&#8208;GAP&#8208;CARBON) to trace the uptake and release of gas molecules alongside the temporal evolution of particle size and surface composition. The experimental results are captured by a model mechanism that involves different types of carbon atoms (edge/plane&#8208;like) and the formation of a reactive oxygen intermediate (activated CO complex) as the rate&#8208;limiting step. A transition between distinct chemical regimes driven by NO2 at lower temperatures and O2 at higher temperatures is reflected by an increase in the observable activation energy from

         <title>Experimental and Computational Evidence of a Stable RNA G&#8208;Triplex Structure at Physiological Temperature in the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Genome</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The quadruplex&#8208;forming RG1 sequence in the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genome is shown to adopt a two&#8208;triads G&#8208;triplex structure at physiological temperature. The high thermodynamic stability of this RNA structure suggests that RNA G&#8208;triplexes could be biologically relevant and represent novel targets for antiviral therapies.







Abstract
RG1 is a quadruplex&#8208;forming sequence in the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genome proposed as possible therapeutic target for COVID&#8208;19. We demonstrate that the dominant conformation of RG1 under physiological conditions differs from the parallel quadruplex previously assumed. Through comprehensive investigations employing CD, UV, NMR, DSC, gel electrophoresis, MD simulations, in silico spectroscopy and the use of truncated RG1 sequences, we have identified this stable conformation as an RNA G&#8208;triplex composed of two G&#8208;triads. We believe this previously unreported RNA structure could serve as a novel therapeutic target. Our findings open new avenues for further studies on the presence and biological role of RNA G&#8208;triplexes in vivo.

         <title>Structure Revision of Halisphingosine A via Total Synthesis and Bioactivity Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of 32 stereoisomers of halisphingosine A in 11&#8211;13 steps with good overall yields. Comparative NMR studies resolved a longstanding structural misconception, leading to the revision of halisphingosine A. Our synthetic analytical study provides an unparalleled level of detail on the challenges associated with determining the structures of non&#8208;model sphingoid bases, and will catalyse future research in marine metabolomics and sphingolipid metabolism.







Abstract
Sphingoid bases are important bioactive lipids found in a variety of organisms, serving as the backbone of sphingolipids, which regulate essential physiological processes. Here we describe the total synthesis and structure revision of halisphingosine A, a sphingoid base initially isolated from marine sponges. To address inconsistencies in the NMR interpretation of this natural product, we developed a synthetic route involving a late&#8208;stage enantioselective Henry reaction that allows access to multiple stereoisomers of the proposed halisphingosine A core structure. Our library of 32 fully characterized synthetic stereoisomers enabled us to rectify the structure of halisphingosine A as (2R,3R,8R,Z)&#8208;2&#8208;aminooctadec&#8208;9&#8208;ene&#8208;1,3,8&#8208;triol, and to pursue further structure&#8211;activity relation (SAR) studies regarding their antimicrobial and cytotoxic potential. In summary, our study offers a yet unreported compound library along with validated analytical datasets of marine sphingoid base derivatives, which significantly affects future ecometabolomic marine research and will facilitate the identification of inhibitors of sphingolipid metabolism or antagonists of sphingolipid base&#8208;sensing receptors.

         <title>A Phosphotriester&#8208;Masked Dideoxy&#8208;cGAMP Derivative as a Cell&#8208;Permeable STING Agonist</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dideoxy analog of cGAS/STING second messenger 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP (cGAMP) was prepared using a new and concise synthetic combination of phosphoramidite and phosphotriester chemistry. By masking the negative charges of the phosphate backbones, the cellular uptake of cGAMP was highly increased from EC50=5&#8197;&#956;M to 25&#8197;nM.







Abstract
2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;Cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP (cGAMP) is a cyclic dinucleotide second messenger in which guanosine and adenosine are connected by one 3&#8242;&#8208;5&#8242; and one 2&#8242;&#8208;5&#8242; phosphodiester linkage. It is formed in the cytosol upon detection of pathogenic DNA by the enzyme guanosine&#8208;monophosphate&#8208;adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS). cGAMP subsequently binds to the adaptor protein stimulator of interferon genes (STING) to elicit an innate immune response leading to the production of type&#8197;I interferons and cytokines. STING agonists are a highly promising avenue for an immuno&#8208;oncological anticancer therapy. A particular challenge with cyclic dinucleotide STING agonists are the two negative charges of the phosphodiester linkages, which strongly reduce the ability of such compounds to penetrate cell membranes. The development of cell&#8208;permeable STING agonists that can stimulate the immune system enhancing their anticancer potency is currently of utmost importance in the field. Herein, we report the development of a dideoxy derivative of cGAMP as a phosphotriester prodrug, where the negative charge of the phosphate backbone has been masked with a thioester. We found that this thioester&#8208;protected compound features a dramatic increase in its cellular potency that rises from EC50=5&#8197;&#956;M to 25&#8197;nM. The new compound is envisioned to enable an efficient STING&#8208;agonist&#8208;based anticancer therapy.

         <title>T&#8208;shaped 14 Electron Rhodium Complexes: Potential Active Species in C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two T&#8208;shaped Rh(I) complexes with PNP pincer ligands have been isolated. They react with C&#8722;H bonds of unactivated substrates such as ethylene and benzene, leading to the oxidative C&#8722;H addition products. Depending on the size of the alkyl groups on the phosphorus atom, the reactivity towards C&#8722;H bonds can be fine&#8208;tuned.







Abstract
Two T&#8208;shaped 14&#8208;electron rhodium complexes 2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b, &#8220;framed&#8221; and thus stabilized by PNP pincer ligands have been synthesized. The bis(t&#8208;butyl)phosphine derived PNPtBu&#8208;rhodium complex 2&#8201;a was isolated from pentane as the more stable cyclometalated Rh(III) hydrido complex and found to be in equilibrium with the T&#8208;shaped 14e&#8722; Rh(I) complex 2&#8201;aT which itself could be directly crystallized upon change of the solvent. The cyclometallation is suppressed using an adamantyl substituted PNPAd ligand to give the analogous T&#8208;shaped Rh(I) species 2&#8201;b, stabilized through an agostic interaction with one of the adamantyl C&#8722;Hs. Depending on the solvent, complex 2&#8201;a reacted with ethylene either by &#960;&#8208;coordination (4&#8201;a) or C&#8722;H activation giving a hydrido&#8208;vinyl Rh(III) species 4&#8201;b, both isomers being in equilibrium in solution. Complex 2&#8201;b was found to reversibly C&#8722;H activate arenes to form the hydrido&#8208;aryl Rh(III) complexes.

         <title>Robust Bisulfite&#8208;Free Single&#8208;Molecule Real&#8208;Time Sequencing of Methyldeoxycytidine Based on a Novel hpTet3 Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
EMox&#8208;seq (enzymatic methylcytidine oxidation sequencing) enables bisulfite&#8208;free, single molecule sequencing of DNA methylation patterns at high precision with just a single enzymatic treatment step, using a high&#8208;performance Tet3 catalytic domain.







Abstract
In addition to the four canonical nucleosides dA, dG, dC and T, genomic DNA contains the additional base 5&#8208;methyldeoxycytidine (mdC). The presence of this methylated cytidine nucleoside in promoter regions or gene bodies significantly affects the transcriptional activity of the corresponding gene. Consequently, the methylation patterns of genes are crucial for either silencing or activating genes. Sequencing the positions of mdC in the genome is therefore of paramount importance for early cancer diagnostics as it helps determine incorrect gene expression. Currently, the bisulfite method is the gold standard for mdC&#8208;sequencing. However, this method has the drawback that the majority of the input DNA is degraded during the bisulfite treatment. Additionally, bisulfite sequencing is prone to errors. Here, we report a benign, bisulfite&#8208;free mdC sequencing method termed EMox&#8208;seq, which is based on third&#8208;generation single&#8208;molecule SMRT sequencing. The foundation of this technology is a new Tet3 enzyme that efficiently oxidizes mdCs to 5&#8208;carboxycytidine (cadC). In turn, cadC provides an excellent readout by SMRT sequencing using specially trained AI&#8208;based algorithms.

         <title>Fluorinated Squareimines for Molecular Sieving of Aromatic over Aliphatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Squareimines are a new class of electron&#8208;deficient macrocycles with a unique rectangular structure that facilitates interactions with the electron&#8208;deficient panels, enabling selective separation of aromatic hydrocarbons from aliphatic mixtures. By using dynamic covalent imine chemistry, crystalline material NDI2F42 is obtained in high yields, with this material demonstrating rapid adsorption and high selectivities for the sieving of aromatic compounds.







Abstract
The development of more energy&#8208;efficient separation technologies is essential. Especially the separation of cyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons from their aromatic counterparts remains a significant challenge due to azeotrope formation and similar physical properties, often requiring energy&#8208;intensive processes. Herein, we introduce a novel class of electron&#8208;deficient macrocycles with a unique rectangular structure to optimise interactions within the pore, enabling the highly selective molecular sieving of aromatic compounds from mixtures. Utilising dynamic covalent imine chemistry, the squareimine NDI2F42&#8208;based crystalline functional material is directly obtained from the reaction mixture in a single self&#8208;assembly step in high yields of 83&#8201;%, alongside the larger NDI2F82 congener, which can be obtained in 69&#8201;% yield. In vapour sorption and diffusion experiments, NDI2F42 demonstrates rapid adsorption kinetics with selectivities of 97&#8201;:&#8201;3 for benzene over cyclohexane and 93&#8201;:&#8201;7 for toluene over methylcyclohexane, while single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction studies indicate that the selectivity is primarily governed by directed interactions between the electron&#8208;deficient panels and aromatic guests.

         <title>Accelerated First&#8208;Principles Exploration of Structure and Reactivity in Graphene Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emerging machine&#8208;learning (ML) approaches to computational chemistry provide atomistic insight into graphene oxide. This work showcases how ML potentials can be fitted by combining accelerated first&#8208;principles molecular dynamics and graph neural&#8208;network models. Large&#8208;scale simulations, driven by the resulting potential, reveal how functional groups in a graphene oxide sheet evolve and graphitic domains form during thermal reduction.







Abstract
Graphene oxide (GO) materials are widely studied, and yet their atomic&#8208;scale structures remain to be fully understood. Here we show that the chemical and configurational space of GO can be rapidly explored by advanced machine&#8208;learning methods, combining on&#8208;the&#8208;fly acceleration for first&#8208;principles molecular dynamics with message&#8208;passing neural&#8208;network potentials. The first step allows for the rapid sampling of chemical structures with very little prior knowledge required; the second step affords state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art accuracy and predictive power. We apply the method to the thermal reduction of GO, which we describe in a realistic (ten&#8208;nanometre scale) structural model. Our simulations are consistent with recent experimental findings, including X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and help to rationalise them in atomistic and mechanistic detail. More generally, our work provides a platform for routine, accurate, and predictive simulations of diverse carbonaceous materials.
