         <title>Nanoarchitectonics with a Membrane&#8208;Embedded Electron Shuttle Mimics the Bioenergy Anabolism of Mitochondria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enhanced bioenergy anabolism through transmembrane redox reactions in artificial systems remains a great challenge. Here, we explore synthetic electron shuttle to activate transmembrane chemo&#8208;enzymatic cascade reactions in a mitochondria&#8208;like nanoarchitecture for augmenting bioenergy anabolism. In this nanoarchitecture, dendritic mesoporous silica microparticle as inner compartment possesses higher load capacity of NADH as proton source and allows faster mass transfer. In addition, it permits the stability of the outer compartment ATP synthase&#8208;reconstituted proteoliposomes. Like natural enzymes in mitochondrion respiratory chain, small synthetic electron shuttle embedded in lipid bilayer, facilely mediates transmembrane redox reactions to convert NADH into NAD+ and proton. These facilitate enhanced outward proton gradient to drive ATP synthase to rotate for catalytic ATP synthesis with improved performance in a sustainable manner. This present work opens a new avenue to achieve enhanced bioenergy anabolism by utilizing synthetic electron shuttle and tuning inner nanostructures, holding great promise in wide&#8208;range ATP&#8208;powered bioapplications.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Radiochemistry with Fluorine&#8208;18, Carbon&#8208;11&#8201;and Zirconium&#8208;89</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores recent developments in light&#8208;driven radiochemistry, focusing on key isotopes (fluorine&#8208;18, carbon&#8208;11, zirconium&#8208;89) in positron emission tomography (PET). These technologies have been used to radiolabel small molecules, peptides and larger biomolecules such as monoclonal antibodies.







Abstract
This review discusses recent advances in light&#8208;driven radiochemistry for three key isotopes: fluorine&#8208;18, carbon&#8208;11, and zirconium&#8208;89, and their applications in positron emission tomography (PET). In the case of fluorine&#8208;18, the predominant approach involves the use of cyclotron&#8208;produced [18F]fluoride or reagents derived thereof. Light serves to activate either the substrate or the fluorine&#8208;18 labeled reagent. Advancements in carbon&#8208;11 photo&#8208;mediated radiochemistry have been leveraged for the radiolabeling of small molecules, achieving various transformations, including 11C&#8208;methylation, 11C&#8208;carboxylation, 11C&#8208;carbonylation, and 11C&#8208;cyanation. Contrastingly, zirconium&#8208;89 photo&#8208;mediated radiochemistry differs from fluorine&#8208;18 and carbon&#8208;11 approaches. In these cases, light facilitates a postlabeling click reaction, which has proven valuable for the labeling of large biomolecules such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). New technological developments, such as the incorporation of photoreactors in commercial radiosynthesizers, illustrate the commitment the field is making in embracing photochemistry. Taken together, these advances in photo&#8208;mediated radiochemistry enable radiochemists to apply new retrosynthetic strategies in accessing novel PET radiotracers.

         <title>Dithiophosphoric Acids for Polymer Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reporton a new polymer functionalization method for challenging poly&#8208;enes substates through a regioselective electrophilic Markovnikov addition with dithiophosphoric acids, which are derived from elemental sulfur and phosphorus feedstocks. DTPA functionalization to these poly&#8208;enes confer enhanced thermomechanical, optical and flame retardant properties using inexpensive reagents.







Abstract
Dithiophosphoric acids (DTPAs) are an intriguing class of compounds that are sourced from elemental sulfur and white phosphorus and are prepared from the reaction of phosphorus pentasulfide with alcohols. The electrophilic addition of DTPAs to alkenes and unsaturated olefinic substrates is a known reaction, but has not been applied to polymer synthesis and polymer functionalization. We report on the synthesis and application of DTPAs for the functionalization of challenging poly&#8208;enes, namely polyisoprene (PI) and polynorbornene (pNB) prepared by ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP). The high heteroatom content within DTPA moieties impart intriguing bulk properties to poly&#8208;ene materials after direct electrophilic addition reactions to the polymer backbone introducing DTPAs as side chain groups. The resulting materials possess both enhanced optical and flame retardant properties vs the poly&#8208;ene starting materials. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to prepare crosslinked polydiene films with di&#8208;functional DTPAs, where the crosslinking density and thermomechanical properties can be directly tuned by DTPA feed ratios.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of silicon&#8208;stereogenic benzoxasiloles has been realized via the intramolecular Si&#8722;O coupling of [2&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)phenyl]silanes using Cu(I)/difluorphos as the efficient catalytic system.

Abstract
A Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of silicon&#8208;stereogenic benzoxasiloles has been realized via intramolecular Si&#8722;O coupling of [2&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)phenyl]silanes. Cu(I)/difluorphos is found to be an efficient catalytic system for enantioselective Si&#8722;C bond cleavage and Si&#8722;O bond formation. In addition, kinetic resolution of racemic substituted [2&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)phenyl]silanes using Cu(I)/ PyrOx (pyridine&#8208;oxazoline ligands) as the catalytic system is developed to afford carbon&#8208; and silicon&#8208;stereogenic benzoxasiloles. Ring&#8208;opening reactions of chiral benzoxasiloles with organolithiums and Grignard reagents yield various enantioenriched functionalized tetraorganosilanes.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are promising lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) cathode materials for their high reversible capacity, but they suffer from fast structural degradation during cycling. Here, we report the Ce/Gd incorporated single&#8208;crystalline LiNi0.83Co0.07Mn0.10O2 (SC&#8208;NCM) cathode materials with significantly enhanced cycling stability. The Gd ions are adequately incorporated in SC&#8208;NCM while Ce ions are prone to aggregate in the outer surface, resulting in the formation of a high&#8208;entropy zone in the near&#8208;surface of SC&#8208;NCM, including a LCGO shell and Ce/Gd dopant&#8208;concentrated layer. The high&#8208;entropy zone can effectively inhibit the oxygen evolution and prevent the formation of oxygen vacancies. Meanwhile, it leads to a greatly improved H2&#8208;H3 phase transformation reversibility and mitigated stress/strain caused by Li&#8208;ion extraction/insertion during (de)lithiation process. The synergetic effects of reduced oxygen vacancies concentration and mitigated stress/strain can effectively prevent the in&#8208;plane migration of TM ions, lattice planar gliding as well as the formation of intragranular nanocracks. Consequently, Ce/Gd incorporated SC&#8208;NCM (SC&#8208;NCM@CG2) delivers a high initial discharge specific capacity of 219.7 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 C and an excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 90.2% after 100 cycles at 1.0 C.</dc:description>

The Gd ions are adequately incorporated in SC-NCM while Ce ions are prone to aggregate in the outer surface, resulting in the formation of a high-entropy zone in the near-surface of SC-NCM, including a LCGO shell and Ce/Gd dopant-concentrated layer. The high-entropy zone can effectively inhibit the oxygen evolution and prevent the formation of oxygen vacancies.

The synergetic effects of reduced oxygen vacancies concentration and mitigated stress/strain can effectively prevent the in-plane migration of TM ions, lattice planar gliding as well as the formation of intragranular nanocracks.

         <title>Nitrogenous Intermediates in NOx&#8208;involved Electrocatalytic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical manufacturing utilizing renewable sources and energy emerges as a promising path towards sustainability and carbon neutrality. The electrocatalytic reactions involving nitrogen oxides (NOx) offered a potential strategy for synthesizing various nitrogenous chemicals. However, it is currently hindered by low selectivity/efficiency and limited reaction pathways, mainly due to the difficulties in controllable generation and utilization of nitrogenous intermediates. In this minireview, focusing on nitrogenous intermediates in NOx&#8208;involved electrocatalytic reactions, we discuss newly developed methodologies for studying and controlling the generation, conversion, and utilizing of nitrogenous intermediates, which enable recent developments in NOx&#8208;involved electrocatalytic reactions that yield various products, including ammonia (NH3), organonitrogen molecules, and nitrogenous compounds exhibiting unconventional oxidation states. Furthermore, we also make an outlook to highlight future directions in the emerging field of NOx&#8208;involved electrocatalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Shortwave&#8208;Infrared J&#8208;aggregates of Aromatic Ring&#8208;Fused Aza&#8208;BODIPYs by Peripheral Substituents for Combined Photothermal and Photodynamic Therapies at Ultralow Laser Power</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving photothermal therapy (PTT) at ultralow laser power density is crucial for minimizing photo&#8208;damage and allowing for higher maximum permissible skin exposure. However, this requires photothermal agents to possess not just superior photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE), but also exceptional near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorptivity. J&#8208;aggregates, exhibit a significant redshift and narrower absorption peak with a higher extinction coefficient. Nevertheless, achieving predictable J&#8208;aggregates through molecular design remains a challenge. In this study, we successfully induced desirable J&#8208;aggregation (&#955;absmax: 968 nm, &#949;: 2.96 &#215; 105 M&#8208;1 cm&#8208;1, &#955;emmax: 972 nm, &#1060;FL: 6.2%) by tuning electrostatic interactions between p&#8208;conjugated molecular planes through manipulating molecular surface electrostatic potential of aromatic ring&#8208;fused aza&#8208;BODIPY dyes. Notably, by controlling the preparation method for encapsulating dyes into F&#8208;127 polymer, we were able to selectively generate H&#8208;/J&#8208;aggregates, respectively. Furthermore, the J&#8208;aggregates exhibited two controllable morphologies: nanospheres and nanowires. Importantly, the shortwave&#8208;infrared J&#8208;aggregated nanoparticles with impressive PCE of 72.9% effectively destroyed cancer cells and mice&#8208;tumors at an ultralow power density of 0.27 W cm&#8208;2 (915 nm). This phototherapeutic nano&#8208;platform, which generates predictable J&#8208;aggregation behavior, and can controllably form J&#8208;/H&#8208;aggregates and selectable J&#8208;aggregate morphology, is a valuable paradigm for developing photothermal agents for tumor&#8208;treatment at ultralow laser power density.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion&#8208;Counterion Strategy toward Organic Cocrystal Engineering for Near&#8208;Infrared Photothermal Conversion and Solar&#8208;Driven Water Evaporation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An anion&#8208;counterion strategy is proposed to construct organic mono&#8208;radical charge&#8208;transfer cocrystals for near&#8208;infrared photothermal conversion and solar&#8208;driven water evaporation. Ionic compounds with halogen anions as the counterions serve as electron donors, providing the necessary electrons for efficient charge transfer with unchanged skeleton atoms and structures as well as the broad red&#8208;shifted absorption (200&#8208;2000nm) and unprecedented photothermal conversion efficiency (~90.5%@808nm) for the cocrystals. Based on these cocrystals, an excellent solar&#8208;driven interfacial water evaporation rate up to 6.1&#177;1.1 kg&#183;m&#8722;2&#183;h&#8722;1 under 1 sun is recorded due to the comprehensive evaporation effect from the cocrystal loading in polyurethane foams and chimney addition, such performance is superior to the reported results on charge&#8208;transfer cocrystals or other materials for solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation. This prototype exhibits the great potential of cocrystals prepared by the one&#8208;step mechanochemistry method in practical large&#8208;scale seawater desalination applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Charge Carrier Dynamics on Sb2Se3 Photocathodes for Efficient Photolectrochemical Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia (NH3) is recognized as a transportable carrier for renewable energy fuels. Photoelectrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (PEC NO3RR) offers a sustainable solution for nitrate&#8208;rich wastewater treatment by directly converting solar energy to ammonia. In this study, we demonstrate the highly selective PEC ammonia production from NO3RR by constructing a CoCu/TiO2/Sb2Se3 photocathode. The constructed CoCu/TiO2/Sb2Se3 photocathode achieves an ammonia Faraday efficiency (FE) of 88.01% at &#8208;0.2 VRHE and an ammonia yield as high as 15.91 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 at &#8208;0.3 VRHE with an excellent onset potential of 0.43 VRHE. Dynamics experiments and theoretical calculations have demonstrated that the CoCu/TiO2/Sb2Se3 photocathode possesses high light absorption capacity, excellent carrier transfer capability, and high charge separation and transfer efficiencies. The photocathode can effectively adsorb the reactant NO3&#8208; and intermediate, and the CoCu co&#8208;catalyst increases the maximum Gibbs free energy difference between NO3RR and HER. Meanwhile, the Co species enhances the spin density of Cu, and increases the density of states near the Fermi level in pdos, which results in a high PEC NO3RR activity on CoCu/TiO2/Sb2Se3. This work provides a new avenue for the feasibility of efficient PEC ammonia synthesis from nitrate&#8208;rich wastewater.</dc:description>

         <title>Massive Molecular Motion in Crystal Leads to an Unexpected Helical Covalent Polymer in a Solid&#8208;state Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We designed a proline&#8208;derived monomer with azide and alkene functional groups to enable topochemical ene&#8208;azide cycloaddition (TEAC) polymerization. In its crystal, the monomer forms supramolecular helices along the 'a' axis through various non&#8208;covalent interactions. Along the 'c' axis, the molecules arrange themselves head&#8208;to&#8208;tail in a wave&#8208;like pattern, positioning the azide and alkene groups of adjacent molecules in close proximity and anti&#8208;parallel orientation, complying with Schmidt's criteria for topochemical reaction. This prearranged configuration was expected to facilitate smooth topochemical polymerization, resulting in a 1,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;linked polymer. Upon heating, the monomer underwent TEAC polymerization in a remarkable single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal fashion, but, to our surprise, it yielded an unexpected covalent helical polymer linked by 1,5&#8208;disubstituted triazoline units. Remarkably, the crystal avoids the ready&#8208;to&#8208;react arrangement for polymerization, but connects monomer molecules within the supramolecular helix through the cycloaddition of azide and alkene groups, even though they are not in close proximity nor in the expected orientation. This unexpected path, involving a substantial 134&#176; rotation of the alkene group, yields hitherto unknown 1,5&#8208;disubstituted triazoline product regiospecifically. This study serves as a cautionary reminder that relying solely on topochemical postulates for predicting reactivity can sometimes be misleading.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Control of Highly Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence in Carbene Zinc(II) Dithiolates
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc &#8208; the new iridium. Structural control of the dihedral angle between the ligands in trigonal&#8208;planar carbene&#8208;ZnII&#8208;dithiolates leads to highly efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) with unprecedented radiative rate constants kTADF=1.2&#215;106&#8197;s&#8722;1 at 297&#8197;K, which surpass the efficiency of commercial IrIII&#8208; and PtII&#8208;based triplet emitters.







Abstract
Luminescent metal complexes based on earth abundant elements are a valuable target to substitute 4d/5d transition metal complexes as triplet emitters in advanced photonic applications. Whereas CuI complexes have been thoroughly investigated in the last two decades for this purpose, no structure&#8208;property&#8208;relationships for efficient luminescence involving triplet excited states from ZnII complexes are established. Herein, we report on the design of monomeric carbene zinc(II) dithiolates (CZT) featuring a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;motif that leads to highly efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) with for ZnII compounds unprecedented radiative rate constants kTADF=1.2&#215;106&#8197;s&#8722;1 at 297&#8197;K. Our high&#8208;level DFT/MRCI calculations revealed that the relative orientation of the ligands involved in the ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (1/3LLCT) states is paramount to control the TADF process. Specifically, a dihedral angle of 36&#8211;40&#176; leads to very efficient reverse intersystem&#8208;crossing (rISC) on the order of 109&#8197;s&#8722;1 due to spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) mediated by the sulfur atoms in combination with a small &#916;ES1&#8208;T1 of ca. 56&#8197;meV.

         <title>Regulating Crystallinity Mismatch Between Donor and Acceptor to Improve Exciton/Charge Transport in Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving a more balanced charge transport by morphological control is crucial in reducing bimolecular and trap&#8208;assisted recombination and enhancing the critical parameters for efficient organic solar cells (OSCs). Hence, a facile strategy is proposed to reduce the crystallinity difference between donor and acceptor by incorporating a novel multifunctional liquid crystal small molecule (LCSM) BDTPF4&#8208;C6 into the binary blend. BDTTPF4&#8208;C6 is the first LCSM based on a tetrafluorobenzene unit and features a low liquid crystal phase transition temperature and strong self&#8208;assembly ability, conducive to regulating the active layer morphology. When BDTPF4&#8208;C6 is introduced as a guest molecule into the PM6:Y6 binary, it exhibits better compatibility with the donor PM6 and primarily resides within the PM6 phase because of the similarity&#8208;intermiscibility principle. Moreover, systematic studies revealed that BDTPF4&#8208;C6 could be used as a seeding agent for PM6 to enhance its crystallinity, thereby forming a more balanced and favourable charge transport with suppressed charge recombination. Intriguingly, dual F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer was observed between the guest molecule and the host donor and acceptor, resulting in an improved current density. This study demonstrates a facile approach to balance the charge mobilities and offers new insights into boosting the efficiency of single&#8208;junction OSCs beyond 20%.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA Quadruplex Structure with a Unique Cation Dependency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetrastranded DNA structure, KNa&#8208;quadruplex (KNaQ), is described. KNaQ forms from repetitive DNA sequences that are abundant in (parasitic) worms but extremely rare in humans or livestock. This opens a possibility of exploiting the fold as a plausible antiparasitic drug target. The structure's unique properties distinguish it from all other known DNA quadruplexes and can be used to design novel recognition DNA elements/sensors.







Abstract
DNA quadruplex structures provide an additional layer of regulatory control in genome maintenance and gene expression and are widely used in nanotechnology. We report the discovery of an unprecedented tetrastranded structure formed from a native G&#8208;rich DNA sequence originating from the telomeric region of Caenorhabditis elegans. The structure is defined by multiple properties that distinguish it from all other known DNA quadruplexes.

     alt="DNA Quadruplex Structure with a Unique Cation Dependency"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tetrastranded DNA structure, KNa-quadruplex (KNaQ), is described. KNaQ forms from repetitive DNA sequences that are abundant in (parasitic) worms but extremely rare in humans or livestock. This opens a possibility of exploiting the fold as a plausible antiparasitic drug target. The structure's unique properties distinguish it from all other known DNA quadruplexes and can be used to design novel recognition DNA elements/sensors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA quadruplex structures provide an additional layer of regulatory control in genome maintenance and gene expression and are widely used in nanotechnology. We report the discovery of an unprecedented tetrastranded structure formed from a native G-rich DNA sequence originating from the telomeric region of &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;. The structure is defined by multiple properties that distinguish it from all other known DNA quadruplexes. Most notably, the formation of a stable so-called KNa-quadruplex (KNaQ) requires concurrent coordination of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions at two distinct binding sites. This structure provides novel insight into G-rich DNA folding under ionic conditions relevant to eukaryotic cell physiology and the structural evolution of telomeric DNA. It highlights the differences between the structural organization of human and nematode telomeric DNA, which should be considered when using &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; as a model in telomere biology, particularly in drug screening applications. Additionally, the absence/presence of KNaQ motifs in the host/parasite introduces an intriguing possibility of exploiting the KNaQ fold as a plausible antiparasitic drug target. The structure's unique shape and ion dependency and the possibility of controlling its folding by using low-molecular-weight ligands can be used for the design or discovery of novel recognition DNA elements and sensors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Creating Remarkably Moisture&#8208; and Air&#8208;Stable Macromolecular Lewis Acid by Integrating Borane within the Polymer Chain: A Highly Active Catalyst for Homo(co)polymerization of Epoxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Borane&#8208;based Lewis acids play an indispensable role in organocatalyst&#8208;mediated polymerization, but most of them are moisture&#8208; and air&#8208;sensitive. This work presents a remarkably moisture and air&#8208;stable macromolecular borane Lewis acid, employing an integration strategy to unify multiple borane within a polymer chain. It functions as a highly active catalyst for homo(co)polymerization of epoxides (TOF=27900&#8197;h&#8722;1) and shows large tolerance to chain transfer agent (1800&#8197;equiv. H2O).







Abstract
Borane&#8208;based Lewis acids (LA) play an indispensable role in the Lewis pair (LP) mediated polymerization. However, most borane&#8208;based LPs are moisture&#8208; and air&#8208;sensitive. Therefore, development of moisture and air&#8208;stable borane&#8208;based LP is highly desirable. To achieve this goal, the concept of &#8220;aggregation induced enlargement effects&#8221; by chemically linking multiple borane within a nanoscopic confinement was conceived to create macromolecular LA. Accordingly, an extremely moisture and air stable macromolecular borane, namely, PVP&#8208;1B featuring poly(4&#8208;vinylphenol) backbone, was constructed. The concentration of borane active site is greatly higher than average concentration due to local confinement. Therefore, an enhanced activity was observed. Moreover, the local LA aggregation effects allow its tolerance to air and large amount of chain transfer agent. Consequently, PVP&#8208;1B showed remarkable efficiency for propylene oxide (PO) polymerization at 25&#8201;&#176;C (TOF=27900&#8197;h&#8722;1). Furthermore, it enables generation of well&#8208;defined telechelic poly (CHO&#8208;alt&#8208;CO2) diol (0.6&#8211;15.3&#8197;kg/mol) with narrow &#272;s via copolymerizing cyclohexene oxide and CO2 at 80&#8201;&#176;C. This work indicates unifying multiple borane within a polymer in a macromolecular level shows superior catalytic performance than constructing binary, bi(multi)functional systems in a molecular level. This paves a new way to make functional polyethers.

         <title>Manipulating the Microenvironment of Single Atoms by Switching Support Crystallinity for Industrial Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The local acidic microenvironment of a single&#8208;atom Ru catalyst is modulated by switching the crystallinity of the support, thus breaking the pH&#8208;dependent alkaline HER activity.







Abstract
Modulating the microenvironment of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is critical to optimizing catalytic activity. Herein, we innovatively propose a strategy to improve the local reaction environment of Ru single atoms by precisely switching the crystallinity of the support from high crystalline and low crystalline, which significantly improves the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. The Ru single&#8208;atom catalyst anchored on low&#8208;crystalline nickel hydroxide (Ru&#8722;LC&#8722;Ni(OH)2) reconstructs the distribution balance of the interfacial ions due to the activation effect of metal dangling bonds on the support. Single&#8208;site Ru with a low oxidation state induces the aggregation of hydronium ions (H3O+), leading to the formation of a local acidic microenvironment in alkaline media, breaking the pH&#8208;dependent HER activity. As a comparison, the Ru single&#8208;atom catalyst anchored on high&#8208;crystalline nickel hydroxide (Ru&#8722;HC&#8722;Ni(OH)2) exhibits a sluggish Volmer step and a conventional local reaction environment. As expected, Ru&#8722;LC&#8722;Ni(OH)2 requires low overpotentials of 9 and 136&#8197;mV at 10 and 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline conditions and operates stably at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 500&#8197;h in an alkaline seawater anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzer. This study provides a new perspective for constructing highly active single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts.

         <title>Enantioselective Hydrophosphination of Terminal Alkenyl Aza&#8208;Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereoselective hydrophosphination of alkenes is a promising route to chiral phosphorus compounds, but the use of alkenyl&#8208;heteroarenes is challenged by their low reactivity and control of stereoselectivity. Here we present a general Mn(I)&#8208;catalysed enantioselective hydrophosphination of alkenyl aza&#8208;heteroarenes. The method was applied to a wide range of alkenyl heterocycles and provided access to a non&#8208;symmetric P,N,P ligand structure.







Abstract
This paper presents a Mn(I)&#8208;catalysed methodology for the enantioselective hydrophosphination of terminal alkenyl aza&#8208;heteroarenes. The catalyst operates through H&#8722;P bond activation, enabling successful hydrophosphination of a diverse range of alkenyl&#8208;heteroarenes with high enantioselectivity. The presented protocol addresses the inherently low reactivity and the commonly encountered suboptimal enantioselectivities of these challenging substrates. As an important application we show that this method facilitates the synthesis of a non&#8208;symmetric tridentate P,N,P&#8208;containing ligand like structure in just two synthetic steps using a single catalytic system.

         <title>CsPbBr3 Quantum Dots Promoted Depolymerization of Oxidized Lignin via Photocatalytic Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation/Reduction Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first semi&#8208;hydrogenation/reduction strategy for photocatalytic depolymerization of oxidized native lignin was realized by the synergistic effect between CsPbBr3 quantum dots and hantzsch ester. Mechanism analysis reveals this approach generates a C&#945; radical intermediate with 4&#8197;times lower bond dissociation energy of C&#946;&#8722;O&#8722;Ar bond from the substrate's carbonyl group, resulting in the excellent reactivity in a wide substrate scope.







Abstract
Due to the demanding depolymerization conditions and limited catalytic efficiency, enhancing lignin valorization remains challenging. Therefore, lowering the bond dissociation energy (BDE) has emerged as a viable strategy for achieving mild yet highly effective cleavage of bonds. In this study, a photocatalytic semi&#8208;hydrogenation/reduction strategy utilizing CsPbBr3 quantum dots (CPB&#8208;QDs) and Hantzsch ester (HEH2) as a synergistic catalytic system was introduced to reduce the BDE of C&#946;&#8722;O&#8722;Ar, achieving effective cleavage of the C&#946;&#8722;O&#8722;Ar bond. This strategy offers a wide substrate scope encompassing various &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 model lignin dimers, preoxidized &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 polymers, and native oxidized lignin, resulting in the production of corresponding ketones and phenols. Notably, this approach attained a turnover frequency (TOF) that is 17&#8197;times higher than that of the reported Ir&#8208;catalytic system in the photocatalytic depolymerization of the lignin model dimers. It has been observed via meticulous experimentation that HEH2 can be activated by CPB&#8208;QDs via single electron transfer (SET), generating HEH2&#8901;+ as a hydrogen donor while also serving as a hole quencher. Moreover, HEH2&#8901;+ readily forms an active transition state with the substrates via hydrogen bonding. Subsequently, the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) from HEH2&#8901;+ to the carbonyl group of the substrate generates a C&#945;&#8901; intermediate.

It has been observed via meticulous experimentation that HEH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be activated by CPB-QDs via single electron transfer (SET), generating HEH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; as a hydrogen donor while also serving as a hole quencher. Moreover, HEH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; readily forms an active transition state with the substrates via hydrogen bonding. Subsequently, the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) from HEH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to the carbonyl group of the substrate generates a C&lt;sub&gt;&#945;&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901; intermediate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Selective Lithium Transport through Crown Ether Pillared Angstrom Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired device that can sieve Li+ out of concentrated Na+ with high selectivity is constructed. The device is composed of angstrom channels that can enrich small cations and pillaring macrocycles that have specific interaction with alkaline ions. In solutions with the concentrations of Li+ and Na+ equal to those in seawater, the effective Li+ selectivity reaches 1422.







Abstract
Biological ion channels use the synergistic effects of various strategies to realize highly selective ion sieving. For example, potassium channels use functional groups and angstrom&#8208;sized pores to discriminate rival ions and enrich target ions. Inspired by this, we constructed a layered crystal pillared by crown ether that incorporates these strategies to realize high Li+ selectivity. The pillared channels and crown ether have an angstrom&#8208;scale size. The crown ether specifically allows the low&#8208;barrier transport of Li+. The channels attract and enrich Li+ ions by up to orders of magnitude. As a result, our material sieves Li+ out of various common ions such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and Al3+. Moreover, by spontaneously enriching Li+ ions, it realizes an effective Li+/Na+ selectivity of 1422 in artificial seawater where the Li+ concentration is merely 25&#8197;&#956;M. We expect this work to spark technologies for the extraction of lithium and other dilute metal ions.

         <title>Correlating Structural Disorder in Metal (Oxy)hydroxides and Catalytic Activity in Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Revealing the structural disorder&#8208;activity correlation during the structural evolution process in oxygen electrocatalysis is crucial. This study highlights that the reaction&#8208;derived Fe&#8722;Ni bimetallic (oxy)hydroxide, featuring a more disordered structure by harnessing the bond mismatch between sulphide/selenide pre&#8208;catalysts and in situ&#8208;derived (oxy)hydroxides, demonstrates enhanced electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Understanding the correlation between the structural evolution of electrocatalysts and their catalytic activity is both essential and challenging. In this study, we investigate this correlation in the context of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by examining the influence of structural disorder during and after dynamic structural evolution on the OER activity of Fe&#8722;Ni (oxy)hydroxide catalysts using operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, alongside other experiments and theoretical calculations. The Debye&#8211;Waller factors obtained from extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analyses reflect the degree of structural disorder and exhibit a robust correlation with the intrinsic OER activities of the electrocatalysts. The enhanced OER activity of in situ&#8208;generated metal (oxy)hydroxides derived from different pre&#8208;catalysts is linked to increased structural disorder, offering a promising approach for designing efficient OER electrocatalysts. This strategy may inspire similar investigations in related electrocatalytic energy&#8208;conversion systems.

         <title>Fast Reaction Kinetics and Commendable Low&#8208;Temperature Adaptability of Zinc Batteries Enabled by Aprotic Water&#8208;Acetamide Symbiotic Solvation Sheath</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild zinc fluoborate&#8208;based aqueous electrolyte was developed by modifying the solvation sheath of Zn2+, leading to a more stable electrode/electrolyte interface and accelerated Zn2+ transfer kinetics. Joint participation in solvation process of water&#8208;acetamide&#8208;anions (Zn(H2O)3(ace)(BF4)2) significantly decreases the freezing point to &#8722;45&#8201;&#176;C, extends the electrochemical stability window to 2.1&#8197;V and facilitates ZnCO3/ZnF2&#8208;rich inorganic/organic solid electrolyte interface.







Abstract
Although rechargeable aqueous zinc batteries are cost effectiveness, intrinsicly safe, and high activity, they are also known for bringing rampant hydrogen evolution reaction and corrosion. While eutectic electrolytes can effectively eliminate these issues, its high viscosity severely reduces the mobility of Zn2+ ions and exhibits poor temperature adaptability. Here, we infuse acetamide molecules with Lewis base and hydrogen bond donors into a solvated shell of Zn[(H2O)6]2+ to create Zn(H2O)3(ace)(BF4)2. The viscosity of 1ace&#8208;1H2O is 0.032&#8197;Pa s, significantly lower than that of 1ace&#8208;0H2O (995.6&#8197;Pa s), which improves ionic conductivity (9.56&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and shows lower freezing point of &#8722;45&#8201;&#176;C, as opposed to 1ace&#8208;0H2O of 4.04&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and 12&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. The acidity of 1ace&#8208;1H2O is &#8776;2.8, higher than 0ace&#8208;1H2O at &#8776;0.76, making side reactions less likely. Furthermore, benefiting from the ZnCO3/ZnF2&#8208;rich organic/inorganic solid electrolyte interface, the Zn&#8201;||&#8201;Zn cells cycle more than 1300&#8197;hours at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the Zn&#8201;||&#8201;Cu operated over 1800 cycles with an average Coulomb efficiency of &#8776;99.8&#8201;%. The Zn&#8201;||&#8201;PANI cell cycled over 8500 cycles, with a specific capacity of 99.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 at room temperature, and operated at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C with a capacity of 66.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Complete Biochemical Characterization of Pantaphos Biosynthesis Highlights an Unusual Role for a SAM&#8208;Dependent Methyltransferase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biosynthesis of the phosphonate natural product pantaphos involves a SAM&#8208;dependent methylation reaction, despite the fact that no SAM&#8208;derived carbon atoms are present in the final product. This irreversible reaction provides the driving force needed to overcome the unfavorable thermodynamics of the preceding dehydration, while reducing the toxicity of the biosynthetic intermediates.







Abstract
Pantaphos is small molecule virulence factor made by the plant pathogen Pantoea ananatis. An 11 gene operon, designated hvr for high virulence, is required for production of this phosphonic acid natural product, but the metabolic steps used in its production have yet to be established. Herein, we determine the complete biosynthetic pathway using a combination of bioinformatics, in vitro biochemistry and in vivo heterologous expression. Only 6 of the 11&#8197;hvr genes are needed to produce pantaphos, while a seventh is likely to be required for export. Surprisingly, the pathway involves a series of O&#8208;methylated intermediates, which are then hydrolyzed to produce the final product. The methylated intermediates are produced by an irreversible S&#8208;adenosylmethione (SAM)&#8208;dependent methyltransferase that is required to drive a thermodynamically unfavorable dehydration in the preceding step, a function not previously attributed to members of this enzyme class. Methylation of pantaphos by the same enzyme is also likely to limit its toxicity in the producing organism. The pathway also involves a novel flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase that differs from homologous proteins due to its endogenous flavin&#8208;reductase activity. Heterologous production of pantaphos by Escherichia coli strains expressing the minimal gene set strongly supports the in vitro biochemical data.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luban locks with mortise and tenon structure have structural diversity and architectural stability, and it is extremely challenging to synthesize Luban lock&#8208;like structures at the molecular level. In this work, we report the cocrystallization of two structurally homologous atom&#8208;precise fcc silver nanoclusters Ag110(SPhF)48(PPh3)12 (Ag110) and Ag14(&#956;6&#8208;S)(SPhF)12(PPh3)8 (Ag14). The Ag110 cluster is the first compound to simulate the complex Luban lock structure at the molecular level.







Abstract
Luban locks with mortise and tenon structure have structural diversity and architectural stability, and it is extremely challenging to synthesize Luban lock&#8208;like structures at the molecular level. In this work, we report the cocrystallization of two structurally related atom&#8208;precise fcc silver nanoclusters Ag110(SPhF)48(PPh3)12 (Ag110) and Ag14(&#956;6&#8208;S)(SPhF)12(PPh3)8 (Ag14). It is worth noting that the Ag110 cluster is the first compound to simulate the complex Luban lock structure at the molecular level. Meanwhile, Ag110 is the largest known fcc&#8208;based silver nanocluster, so far, there is no precedent for fcc silver nanocluster with more than 100 silver atoms. DFT calculations show that Ag110 is a 58&#8208;electron superatom with an electronically closed shell1S21P61D102S21F142P61G18. Ag110&#8901;Ag14 can rapidly catalyze the reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol within 4&#8197;minutes. In addition, Ag110 presents clear structural evidence to reveal the critical size and mechanism of the transformation of metal core from fcc stacking to quasi&#8208;spherical superatom. This research work provides an important structural model for studying the nucleation mechanism and structural assembly of silver nanoclusters.

         <title>Active Diluent&#8208;Anion Synergy Strategy Regulating Nonflammable Electrolytes for High&#8208;Efficiency Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonflammable dimethylacetamide (DMAC)&#8208;based localized high concentration electrolyte (LHCE&#8208;DFB) was regulated by functional diluent 1,2&#8208;difluorobenzene (DFB) via active diluent&#8208;anion synergy strategy. DFB can cooperate with FSI&#8722; anion to construct robust LiF&#8208;rich SEI and CEI owing to its good fluorine&#8208;donating activity and low LUMO, effectively enhancing the interfacial stability of the Li metal anodes and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathodes.







Abstract
High&#8208;energy Li metal batteries (LMBs) consisting of Li metal anodes and high&#8208;voltage cathodes are promising candidates of the next generation energy&#8208;storage systems owing to their ultrahigh energy density. However, it is still challenging to develop high&#8208;voltage nonflammable electrolytes with superior anode and cathode compatibility for LMBs. Here, we propose an active diluent&#8208;anion synergy strategy to achieve outstanding compatibility with Li metal anodes and high&#8208;voltage cathodes by using 1,2&#8208;difluorobenzene (DFB) with high activity for yielding LiF as an active diluent to regulate nonflammable dimethylacetamide (DMAC)&#8208;based localized high concentration electrolyte (LHCE&#8208;DFB). DFB and bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (FSI&#8722;) anion cooperate to construct robust LiF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI), which effectively stabilize DMAC from intrinsic reactions with Li metal anode and enhance the interfacial stability of the Li metal anodes and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathodes. LHCE&#8208;DFB enables ultrahigh Coulombic efficiency (98.7&#8201;%), dendrite&#8208;free, extremely stable and long&#8208;term cycling of Li metal anodes in Li&#8201;||&#8201;Cu cells and Li&#8201;||&#8201;Li cells. The fabricated NCM811&#8201;||&#8201;Li cells with LHCE&#8208;DFB display remarkably enhanced long&#8208;term cycling stability and excellent rate capability. This work provides a promising active diluent&#8208;anion synergy strategy for designing high&#8208;voltage electrolytes for high&#8208;energy batteries.

         <title>Modulating the Dipole Moment of Secondary Ammonium Spacers for Efficient 2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two dipole spacers based on azetidine (Az), namely 3&#8208;OHAz and 3,3&#8208;DFAz, were developed for 2D PSCs. The 3,3&#8208;DFAz&#8208;Pb (n=4) with highly polarized dipole and fluorinated spacers exhibits improved film quality, better&#8208;matched energy level alignment, and a lower exciton binding energy compared to 3&#8208;OHAz&#8208;Pb film. When using mixed A&#8208;site cations, the 3,3&#8208;DFAz&#8208;based device achieved a champion PCE of 19.85&#8201;%.







Abstract
Layered two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites are emerging as promising optoelectronic materials owing to their excellent environmental stability. Regulating the dipole moment of organic spacers has the potential to reduce the exciton binding energy (Eb) of 2D perovskites and improve their photovoltaic performance. Here, we developed two azetidine&#8208;based secondary ammonium spacers with different electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, namely 3&#8208;hydroxyazatidine (3&#8208;OHAz) and 3,3&#8208;difluoroazetidine (3,3&#8208;DFAz) spacers, for 2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (RP) perovskites. It was found that the large dipole moment of the fluorinated dipole spacer could effectively enhance the interaction between organic spacers and inorganic layers, leading to improved charge dissociation in 2D RP perovskite. In contrast to 3&#8208;OHAz spacer, the 2D perovskite using 3,3&#8208;DFAz as spacer also shows improved film quality, optimized energy level alignment, and reduced exciton binding energy. As a result, the 2D perovskite (n=4) device based on 3,3&#8208;DFAz yields an outstanding efficiency of 19.28&#8201;%, surpassing that of the 3&#8208;OHAz&#8208;Pb device (PCE=11.35&#8201;%). The efficiency was further improved to 19.85&#8201;% when using mixed A&#8208;site cation of MA0.95FA0.05. This work provides an effective strategy for modulating the energy level alignment and reducing the Eb by regulating the dipole moment of organic spacers, ultimately enabling the development of high&#8208;performance 2D perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Electronically Manipulated Molecular Strategy Enabling Highly Efficient Tin Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we introduce trimethoxy (3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropyl)&#8208;silane (F3&#8208;TMOS) with molecular dipole moment pointing towards the hole transport layer as the buried interface modification material not only optimizes energy level alignment and carrier dynamics but also relieves interface strain and reduces lattice distortion, resulting in a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.67&#8201;%.







Abstract
Buried interface modification can effectively improve the compatibility between interfaces. Given the distinct interface selections in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the applicability of a singular modification material remains limited. Consequently, in response to this challenge, we devised a tailored molecular strategy based on the electronic effects of specific functional groups. Therefore, we prepared three distinct silane coupling agents, and due to the varying inductive effects of these functional groups, the electronic distribution and molecular dipole moments of the coupling agents are correspondingly altered. Among them, trimethoxy (3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropyl)&#8208;silane (F3&#8208;TMOS), which possesses electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, generates a molecular dipole moment directed toward the hole transport layer (HTL). This approach changes the work function of the HTL, optimizes the energy level alignment, reduces the open&#8208;circuit voltage loss, and facilitates carrier transport. Furthermore, through the buffering effect of the coupling agent, the interface strain and lattice distortion caused by annealing the perovskite are reduced, enhancing the stability of the tin&#8208;based perovskite. Encouragingly, tin PSCs treated with F3&#8208;TMOS achieved a champion efficiency of 14.67&#8201;%. This strategy provides an expedient avenue for the design of buried interface modification materials, enabling precise molecular adjustments in accordance with distinct interfacial contexts to ameliorate mismatched energetics and enhance carrier dynamics.

&lt;p&gt;In this study, we introduce trimethoxy (3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)-silane (F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-TMOS) with molecular dipole moment pointing towards the hole transport layer as the buried interface modification material not only optimizes energy level alignment and carrier dynamics but also relieves interface strain and reduces lattice distortion, resulting in a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.67&#8201;%.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buried interface modification can effectively improve the compatibility between interfaces. Given the distinct interface selections in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the applicability of a singular modification material remains limited. Consequently, in response to this challenge, we devised a tailored molecular strategy based on the electronic effects of specific functional groups. Therefore, we prepared three distinct silane coupling agents, and due to the varying inductive effects of these functional groups, the electronic distribution and molecular dipole moments of the coupling agents are correspondingly altered. Among them, trimethoxy (3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)-silane (F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-TMOS), which possesses electron-withdrawing groups, generates a molecular dipole moment directed toward the hole transport layer (HTL). This approach changes the work function of the HTL, optimizes the energy level alignment, reduces the open-circuit voltage loss, and facilitates carrier transport. Furthermore, through the buffering effect of the coupling agent, the interface strain and lattice distortion caused by annealing the perovskite are reduced, enhancing the stability of the tin-based perovskite. Encouragingly, tin PSCs treated with F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-TMOS achieved a champion efficiency of 14.67&#8201;%. This strategy provides an expedient avenue for the design of buried interface modification materials, enabling precise molecular adjustments in accordance with distinct interfacial contexts to ameliorate mismatched energetics and enhance carrier dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first catalytic asymmetric synthesis of five&#8208;five&#8208;membered furan&#8208;based compounds bearing both axial and central chirality has been established via organocatalytic asymmetric (2+4) annulation with uncommon regioselectivity in high yields with excellent regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivities. Theoretical calculations provide an in&#8208;depth understanding of the reaction pathway and the origin of selectivity.







Abstract
In the chemistry community, catalytic asymmetric synthesis of furan&#8208;based compounds bearing both axial and central chirality has proven to be a significant but challenging issue owing to the importance and difficulty in constructing such frameworks. In this work, we have realized the first catalytic asymmetric synthesis of five&#8208;five&#8208;membered furan&#8208;based compounds bearing both axial and central chirality via organocatalytic asymmetric (2+4) annulation of achiral furan&#8208;indoles with 2,3&#8208;indolyldimethanols with uncommon regioselectivity. By this strategy, furan&#8208;indole compounds bearing both axial and central chirality were synthesized in high yields with excellent regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivities. Moreover, theoretical calculations were conducted to provide an in&#8208;depth understanding of the reaction pathway, activation mode, and the origin of the selectivity.

         <title>2D Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanosheets based on Pd&#8208;TCPP as Photocatalysts for Highly Improved Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D MOFs with coordinated Pd and Pt single atom sites show a striking difference in photocatalytic performance&#8212;Pd&#8208;MOF outperforms Pt&#8208;MOF over all light wavelengths, even though they have identical coordination and similar light absorption characteristics. The remarkable efficiency of Pd MOFs is ascribed to enhanced charge transfer and extended carrier lifetime.







Abstract
In this report, a 2D MOF nanosheet derived Pd single&#8208;atom catalyst, denoted as Pd&#8208;MOF, was fabricated and examined for visible light photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This Pd&#8208;MOF can provide a remarkable photocatalytic activity (a H2 production rate of 21.3&#8197;mmol/gh in the visible range), which outperforms recently reported Pt&#8208;MOFs (with a H2 production rate of 6.6&#8197;mmol/gh) with a similar noble metal loading. Notably, this high efficiency of Pd&#8208;MOF is not due to different chemical environment of the metal center, nor by changes in the spectral light absorption. The higher performance of the Pd&#8208;MOF in comparison to the analogue Pt&#8208;MOF is attributed to the longer lifetime of the photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs and higher charge transfer efficiency.

         <title>Enabling Polymer Single Crystals to Be High&#8208;Performance Dielectric</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking polyethylene as example, hundred&#8208;microns&#8208;size polymer lamellar single crystals (PLSC) are obtained. And the PLSC is applied as dielectric in MIM capacitor with a non&#8208;destructive strategy. The PLSC based nanometer capacitor exhibits exceptional dielectric properties with a high breakdown strength and a low dielectric constant.







Abstract
Semicrystalline polymer dielectrics (SPDs) are highly sought&#8208;after state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art dielectric materials. As the disorder in SPDs degrades their electrical properties, homogeneously ordered SPDs are desired. However, complex crystallization behaviors of polymers make such homogeneity elusive. Polymer lamellar single crystals (PLSCs), the most regularly&#8208;ordered form of SPDs possible under mild crystallizing conditions, are ideal platforms for understanding and developing high&#8208;performance dielectric materials. Here, a typical and widely used SPD, polyethylene (PE) is selected as the model material. We successfully obtained, large, uniform, and high&#8208;quality PE PLSCs and devised a non&#8208;destructive strategy to construct PE PLSC&#8208;based vertical capacitors. These nanometer&#8208;thick capacitors exhibit exceptional dielectric properties, with a high breakdown strength of 6.95 MV/cm and a low dielectric constant of 2.14&#177;0.07, that outperform the properties of any existing neat PE. This work provides novel insights into exploring the performance possibility of ordered SPDs and reveals the PLSCs as potential high&#8208;performance dielectric materials.

         <title>Regulating Perovskite Crystallization through Interfacial Engineering Using a Zwitterionic Additive Potassium Sulfamate for Efficient Pure&#8208;Blue Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional interface engineering is proposed for perovskite crystallization modulation and defect passivation by incorporating a zwitterionic additive potassium sulfamate onto the grain&#8208;growth substrate, leading to pure&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes with a champion external quantum efficiency of 17.32&#8201;% at 478&#8197;nm and spectrally stable CIE chromaticity coordinate of (0.106, 0.129).







Abstract
Quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;2D) perovskites are emerging as efficient emitters in blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs), while the imbalanced crystallization of the halide&#8208;mixed system limits further improvements in device performance. The rapid crystallization caused by Cl doping produces massive defects at the interface, leading to aggravated non&#8208;radiative recombination. Meanwhile, unmanageable perovskite crystallization is prone to facilitate the formation of nonuniform low&#8208;dimensional phases, which results in energy loss during the exciton transfer process. Here, we propose a multifunctional interface engineering for nucleation and phase regulation by incorporating the zwitterionic additive potassium sulfamate into the hole transport layer. By using potassium ions (K+) as heterogeneous nucleation seeds, finely controlled growth of interfacial K+&#8208;guided grains is achieved. The sulfamate ions can simultaneously regulate the phase distribution and passivate defects through coordination interactions with undercoordinated lead atoms. Consequently, such synergistic effect constructs quasi&#8208;2D blue perovskite films with smooth energy landscape and reduced trap states, leading to pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 17.32&#8201;%, spectrally stable emission at 478&#8197;nm and the prolonged operational lifetime. This work provides a unique guide to comprehensively regulate the halide&#8208;mixed blue perovskite crystallization by manipulating the characteristics of grain&#8208;growth substrate.

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF)&#8208;active Coinage&#8208;metal Sulfide Clusters for High&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray Imaging</title>

High X&#8208;ray absorption and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties jointly support hexanuclear cluster scintillators for high&#8208;resolution imaging.







Abstract
The study of facile&#8208;synthesis and low&#8208;cost X&#8208;ray scintillators with high light yield, low detection limit and high X&#8208;ray imaging resolution plays a vital role in medical and industrial imaging fields. However, the optimal balance between X&#8208;ray absorption, decay lifetime and excitonic utilization efficiency of scintillators to achieve high&#8208;resolution imaging is extremely difficult due to the inherent contradiction. Here two thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)&#8208;actived coinage&#8208;metal clusters M6S6L6 (M=Ag or Cu) were synthesized by simple solvothermal reaction, where the cooperation of heavy atom&#8208;rich character and TADF mechanism supports strong X&#8208;ray absorption and rapid luminescent collection of excitons. Excitingly, Ag6S6L6 (SC&#8208;Ag) displays a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 91.6&#8201;% and scintillating light yield of 17420&#8197;photons&#8201;MeV&#8722;1, as well as a low detection limit of 208.65&#8197;nGy&#8201;s&#8722;1 that is 26&#8197;times lower than the medical standard (5.5&#8197;&#956;Gy&#8201;s&#8722;1). More importantly, a high X&#8208;ray imaging resolution of 16&#8197;lp/mm based on SC&#8208;Ag screen is demonstrated. Besides, rigid core skeleton reinforced by metallophilicity endows clusters M6S6L6 strong resistance to humidity and radiation. This work provides a new view for the design of efficient scintillators and opens the research door for silver clusters in scintillation application.

&lt;p&gt;High X-ray absorption and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties jointly support hexanuclear cluster scintillators for high-resolution imaging.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study of facile-synthesis and low-cost X-ray scintillators with high light yield, low detection limit and high X-ray imaging resolution plays a vital role in medical and industrial imaging fields. However, the optimal balance between X-ray absorption, decay lifetime and excitonic utilization efficiency of scintillators to achieve high-resolution imaging is extremely difficult due to the inherent contradiction. Here two thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)-actived coinage-metal clusters M&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (M=Ag or Cu) were synthesized by simple solvothermal reaction, where the cooperation of heavy atom-rich character and TADF mechanism supports strong X-ray absorption and rapid luminescent collection of excitons. Excitingly, Ag&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;SC-Ag&lt;/b&gt;) displays a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 91.6&#8201;% and scintillating light yield of 17420&#8197;photons&#8201;MeV&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, as well as a low detection limit of 208.65&#8197;nGy&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; that is 26&#8197;times lower than the medical standard (5.5&#8197;&#956;Gy&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

         <title>Bridging Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Catalysis: Phosphine&#8208;Functionalized Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphine&#8208;functionalized MOFs (P&#8208;MOFs) offer novel opportunities in heterogeneous catalysis. In this Minireview, we summarize the synthetic strategies, characterization and catalytic reactions based on the reported P&#8208;MOFs. In particular, we remark the current obstacles and possible solutions, including new reaction types and techniques as the perspectives for the development of P&#8208;MOF catalysts, highlighting the opportunities behind challenges.







Abstract
Phosphine&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;organic frameworks (P&#8208;MOFs) as an emerging class of coordination polymers, have provided novel opportunities for the development of heterogeneous catalysts. Yet, compared with the ubiquitous phosphine systems in homogeneous catalysis, heterogenization of phosphines in MOFs is still at its early stage. In this Minireview, we summarize the synthetic strategies, characterization and catalytic reactions based on the P&#8208;MOFs reported in literature. In particular, various catalytic reactions are discussed in detail in terms of phosphine ligand structure&#8208;function relationship, including the potential obstacles for future development. Finally, we discuss the possible solutions, including new types of reactions and techniques as the perspectives for the development of P&#8208;MOF catalysts, highlighting the opportunities and challenges.

         <title>The Retaining Pse5Ac7Ac Pseudaminyltransferase KpsS1 Defines a Previously Unreported Glycosyltransferase Family (GTXXX)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cell surface sugar 5,7&#8208;diacetyl pseudaminic acid (Pse5Ac7Ac) is a bacterial analogue of the ubiquitous sialic acid, Neu5Ac, and contributes to the virulence of a number of multidrug resistant bacteria, including ESKAPE pathogens&#160;Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and&#160;Acinetobacter baumannii. Despite its discovery in the surface glycans of bacteria over thirty years ago, to date no glycosyltransferase enzymes (GTs) dedicated to the synthesis of a pseudaminic acid glycosidic linkage have been unequivocally characterised&#160;in vitro. Herein we demonstrate that&#160;A. baumannii&#160;KpsS1 is a dedicated pseudaminyltransferase enzyme (PseT) which constructs a Pse5Ac7Ac&#8208;a(2,6)&#8208;Glcp&#160;linkage, and proceeds with retention of anomeric configuration. We utilise this PseT activity in tandem with the biosynthetic enzymes required for CMP&#8208;Pse5Ac7Ac assembly, in a two&#8208;pot, seven enzyme synthesis of an&#160;a&#8208;linked Pse5Ac7Ac glycoside. Due to its unique activity and protein sequence, we also assign KpsS1 as the prototypical member of a previously unreported GT family (GTXXX).</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Shape Change of Liquid Crystal Polymer Based on An Order&#8208;Order Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid crystal actuators conventionally undergo shape changes across an order&#8208;disorder phase transition between liquid crystal (LC) and isotropic phases. In this study, we introduce an innovative Liquid Crystal Polymer (LCP) actuator harnessing an order&#8208;order LC phase transition mechanism. The LCP film is easily stretchable within the LC phase, facilitated by the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of phenyl groups serving as robust physical crosslinking points, and thereby transforms to a stable monodomain structure. The resultant monodomain LCP actuator shows a distinctive reversible dynamic shape change, exhibiting extension followed by contraction along the LC director on cooling. The extension is propelled by the reversible smectic C to smectic A phase transition, and the contraction is attributed to the re&#8208;entry to the smectic C phase from smectic A phase. Thermal annealing temperature&#160;determines this peculiar dynamic shape change, which occurs during both heating and cooling processes. This pivotal attribute finds manifestation in gripper and flower&#8208;shaped actuators, adeptly executing grabbing and releasing as well as blooming and closure motions within a single thermal stimulation. In essence, our study introduces an innovative approach to the realm of LCP actuators, ushering in a new avenue for the design and fabrication of versatile and dynamically responsive LCP actuators.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Plasmonic Hot Electron Energy on Ag Surface&#160;by Amine Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plasmonic catalysis has emerged as a promising approach to solar&#8208;chemical energy conversion. Notably, hot carriers play a decisive role in plasmonic catalysis since only when their energy matches with the LUMO or HOMO energy of the reactant molecule, can the reaction be activated. However, the hot carrier energy depends on the intrinsic physicochemical properties of the plasmonic metal substrate and the interaction with incident light. Tuning the hot carrier energy is of great significance for plasmonic catalysis but remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate that the energy of hot electrons can be significantly elevated to an unprecedented level through the coordination of amines on Ag surface. The bonding of amines and Ag reduces the work function of nanoparticles, leading to the increase of hot electron energy by 0.4 eV. This enhancement of energy promotes the cleavage of C&#8208;X (X=Cl, F) bonds upon excitation by visible light. This study provides new insights for promoting plasmonic charge transfer and enhancing the photocatalytic performance of plasmon&#8208;mediated systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Tip&#8208;like Fe&#8208;N4 Sites Induced Surface Microenvironments Regulation Boosts the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single atom catalysts with defined local structures and favorable surface microenvironments are significant for overcoming slow kinetics and accelerating O2 electroreduction. Here, enriched tip&#8208;like FeN4 sites (T&#8208;Fe SAC) on spherical carbon surfaces were developed to investigate the change in surface microenvironments and catalysis behavior. Finite element method (FEM) simulations, together with experiments, indicate the strong local electric field of the tip&#8208;like FeN4 could reduce the hydrogen bond of interfacial water, thereby enhancing the kinetics of the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process. In situ spectroelectrochemical studies and the density functional theory (DFT) calculation results indicate the pathway transition on the tip&#8208;like FeN4 sites, promoting the dissociation of O&#8722;O bond via side&#8208;on adsorption model. The adsorbed OH* can be facilely released on the curved surface and accelerate the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics. The obtained T&#8208;Fe SAC nanoreactor exhibits excellent ORR activities (E1/2 = 0.91 V vs. RHE) and remarkable stability, exceeding those of flat FeN4 and Pt/C. This work clarified the in&#8208;depth insights into the origin of catalytic activity of tip&#8208;like FeN4 sites and held great promise in industrial catalysis, electrochemical energy storage, and many other fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Helitwistacenes &#8211; Combining Lateral and Longitudinal Helicity Results in Solvent&#8208;Induced Inversion of Circularly Polarized Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helicity is expressed differently in ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;fused acenes &#8208; helicenes and twistacenes, respectively. While the extent of helicity is constant in helicenes, it can be tuned in twistacenes, and the handedness of flexible twistacenes is often determined by more rigid helicenes. Here, we combine helicenes with rigid twistacenes consisting of a tunable degree of twisting, forming helitwistacenes.&#160; While the X&#8208;ray structures reveal that the connection does not affect the helicity of each moiety, their ECD and CPL spectra are strongly affected by the helicity of the twistacene unit, resulting in solvent&#8208;induced sign inversion. ROESY&#8208;NMR and TD&#8208;DFT calculations support this observation, which is explained by differences in the relative orientation of the helicene and twistacene moieties.</dc:description>

         <title>Clean Synthetic Strategies to Biologically Active Molecules from Lignin: A Green Path to Drug Discovery
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sustainable strategies inspired by the innate structural features of lignin were developed for the synthesis of diverse biologically active compounds, including tetrahydroisoquinolines, quinazolinones, dopamine and the natural product tetrahydropapaveroline. The synthetic approach enabled the rapid assessment of relevant biological activities through in vitro and in vivo studies and computational similarity searches, with multiple promising hits identified.







Abstract
Deriving active pharmaceutical agents from renewable resources is crucial to increasing the economic feasibility of modern biorefineries and promises to alleviate critical supply&#8208;chain dependencies in pharma manufacturing. Our multidisciplinary approach combines research in lignin&#8208;first biorefining, sustainable catalysis, and alternative solvents with bioactivity screening, an in vivo efficacy study, and a structural&#8208;similarity search. The resulting sustainable path to novel anti&#8208;infective, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and anticancer molecules enabled the rapid identification of frontrunners for key therapeutic indications, including an anti&#8208;infective against the priority pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae with efficacy in vivo and promising plasma and metabolic stability. Our catalytic methods provided straightforward access, inspired by the innate structural features of lignin, to synthetically challenging biologically active molecules with the core structure of dopamine, namely, tetrahydroisoquinolines, quinazolinones, 3&#8208;arylindoles and the natural product tetrahydropapaveroline. Our diverse array of atom&#8208;economic transformations produces only harmless side products and uses benign reaction media, such as tunable deep eutectic solvents for modulating reactivity in challenging cyclization steps.

         <title>Enhanced Light&#8208;Harvesting and Energy Transfer in Carbon Dots Embedded Thylakoids for Photonic Hybrid Capacitor Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solar&#8208;powered zinc&#8208;ion hybrid capacitor (ZHC) based on natural thylakoids (Thy) and fluorescent carbon dots (CDs) was developed for simultaneous light harvesting and energy storage. With emission reabsorption and FRET derived from CDs by thylakoids, the hybrid thylakoids exhibited enhanced bioelectricity generation. As a result, the CDs/Thy&#8208;based ZHC shows a remarkable photo&#8208;charging voltage response of &#8776;1.2&#8197;V.







Abstract
Nanohybrid photosystems have advantages in converting solar energy into electricity, while natural photosystems based solar&#8208;powered energy&#8208;storage device is still under developed. Here, we fabricate a new kind of photo&#8208;rechargeable zinc&#8208;ion hybrid capacitor (ZHC) benefiting from light&#8208;harvesting carbon dots (CDs) and natural thylakoids for realizing solar energy harvesting and storage simultaneously. Under solar light irradiation, the embedded CDs in thylakoids (CDs/Thy) can convert the less absorbed green light into highly absorbed red light for thylakoids, besides, F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between CDs and Thy also occurs, which facilitates the photoelectrons generation during thylakoids photosynthesis, thereby resulting in 6&#8208;fold photocurrent output in CDs/Thy hybrid photosystem, compared to pristine thylakoids. Using CDs/Thy as the photocathode in ZHCs, the photonic hybrid capacitor shows photoelectric conversion and storage features. CDs can improve the photo&#8208;charging voltage response of ZHCs to &#8776;1.2&#8197;V with a remarkable capacitance enhancement of 144&#8201;% under solar light. This study provides a promising strategy for designing plant&#8208;based photonic and electric device for solar energy harvesting and storage.

         <title>Switching Lead for Tin in PbHfO3: Noncubic Structure of SnHfO3
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The replacement of Pb(II) for Sn(II) cations in perovskite oxides is challenging because of their high thermodynamic instability. A new orthorhombic SnHfO3 perovskite has been synthesized via removal of Pb(II) cations from PbHfO3 by reaction with a SnClF salt.







Abstract
The removal of lead from commercialized perovskite&#8208;oxide&#8208;based piezoceramics has been a recent major topic in materials research owing to legislation in many countries. In this regard, Sn(II)&#8208;perovskite oxides have garnered keen interest due to their predicted large spontaneous electric polarizations and isoelectronic nature for substitution of Pb(II) cations. However, they have not been considered synthesizable owing to their high metastability. Herein, the perovskite lead hafnate, i.e., PbHfO3 in space group Pbam, is shown to react with SnClF at a low temperature of 300&#8201;&#176;C, and resulting in the first complete Sn(II)&#8208;for&#8208;Pb(II) substitution, i.e. SnHfO3. During this topotactic transformation, a high purity and crystallinity is conserved with Pbam symmetry, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray and electron diffraction, elemental analysis, and 119Sn M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy. In situ diffraction shows SnHfO3 also possesses reversible phase transformations and is potentially polar between &#8776;130&#8211;200&#8201;&#176;C. This so&#8208;called &#8216;de&#8208;leadification&#8217; is thus shown to represent a highly useful strategy to fully remove lead from perovskite&#8208;oxide&#8208;based piezoceramics and opening the door to new explorations of polar and antipolar Sn(II)&#8208;oxide materials.

         <title>Unlocking a Dual&#8208;Channel Pathway in CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol over Single&#8208;Site Zirconium on Amorphous Silica</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a Cu/Zr&#8208;SiO2 catalyst, the interface between Cu and single&#8208;site Zr stabilized by a SiO2 matrix promotes a reverse water&#8208;gas shift + CO&#8208;hydro pathway. The additional pathway supplements the transitional formate pathway on ZrO2 particles during CO2 hydrogenation to methanol.







Abstract
Converting CO2 into methanol on a large scale is of great significance in the sustainable methanol economy. Zirconia species are considered to be an essential support in Cu&#8208;based catalysts due to their excellent properties for CO2 adsorption and activation. However, the evolution of Zr species during the reaction and the effect of their structure on the reaction pathways remain unclear. Herein, single&#8208;site Zr species in an amorphous SiO2 matrix are created by enhancing the Zr&#8722;Si interaction in Cu/ZrO2&#8208;SiO2 catalysts. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveals that the coordination environment of single&#8208;site Zr is sensitive to the atmosphere and reaction conditions. We demonstrate that the CO2 adsorption occurs preferably on the interface of Cu and single&#8208;site Zr rather than on ZrO2 nanoparticles. Methanol synthesis in reverse water&#8208;gas&#8208;shift (RWGS)+CO&#8208;hydro pathway is verified only over single&#8208;dispersed Zr sites, whereas the ordinary formate pathway occurs on ZrO2 nanoparticles. Thus, it expands a non&#8208;competitive parallel pathway as a supplement to the dominant formate pathway, resulting in the enhancement of Cu activity sixfold and twofold based on Cu/SiO2 and Cu/ZrO2 catalysts, respectively. The establishment of this dual&#8208;channel pathway by single&#8208;site Zr species in this work opens new horizons for understanding the role of atomically dispersed oxides in catalysis science.

We demonstrate that the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption occurs preferably on the interface of Cu and single-site Zr rather than on ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles. Methanol synthesis in reverse water-gas-shift (RWGS)+CO-hydro pathway is verified only over single-dispersed Zr sites, whereas the ordinary formate pathway occurs on ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles. Thus, it expands a non-competitive parallel pathway as a supplement to the dominant formate pathway, resulting in the enhancement of Cu activity sixfold and twofold based on Cu/SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Cu/ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalysts, respectively. The establishment of this dual-channel pathway by single-site Zr species in this work opens new horizons for understanding the role of atomically dispersed oxides in catalysis science.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Highly Bright Near&#8208;Infrared Afterglow Luminophore for Activatable Ultrasensitive In Vivo Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; afterglow probe was designed, exhibiting high 1O2 generation and capture ability with a single molecule. Through intramolecular energy transfer strategy, the afterglow probe showed an extremely bright afterglow luminescence with an emission wavelength located in NIR&#8208;I region (&gt;650&#8197;nm), which allowed deeper tissue penetration, higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio, and imaging sensitivity both in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Afterglow luminescence imaging probes, with long&#8208;lived emission after cessation of light excitation, have drawn increasing attention in biomedical imaging field owing to their elimination of autofluorescence. However, current afterglow agents always suffer from an unsatisfactory signal intensity and complex systems consisting of multiple ingredients. To address these issues, this study reports a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) afterglow luminophore (TPP&#8208;DO) by chemical conjugation of an afterglow substrate and a photosensitizer acting as both an afterglow initiator and an energy relay unit into a single molecule, resulting in an intramolecular energy transfer process to improve the afterglow brightness. The constructed TPP&#8208;DO NPs emit a strong NIR afterglow luminescence with a signal intensity of up to 108&#8197;p/s/cm2/sr at a low concentration of 10&#8197;&#956;M and a low irradiation power density of 0.05&#8197;W/cm2, which is almost two orders of magnitude higher than most existing organic afterglow probes. The highly bright NIR afterglow luminescence with minimized background from TPP&#8208;DO NPs allows a deep tissue penetration depth ability. Moreover, we develop a GSH&#8208;activatable afterglow probe (Q&#8208;TPP&#8208;DO NPs) for ultrasensitive detection of subcutaneous tumor with the smallest tumor volume of 0.048&#8197;mm3, demonstrating the high potential for early diagnosis and imaging&#8208;guided surgical resection of tumors.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Peptides ADP&#8208;Ribosylated at Histidine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the preparation of ribofuranosylated Fmoc&#8208;histidine building blocks via a Mukaiyama&#8208;type glycosylation. These building blocks were used in solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis, followed by on&#8208;resin pyrophosphate construction and deprotection to access peptides containing N(&#964;)&#8208; and N(&#960;)&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated histidine. The N&#8208;glycosidic linkage proved stable to the treatment with aqueous acid and base and resistant to (ADP&#8208;ribosyl)hydrolases.







Abstract
The transfer of an adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribose moiety to a nucleophilic side chain by consumption of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is referred to as ADP&#8208;ribosylation, which allows for the spatiotemporal regulation of vital processes such as apoptosis and DNA repair. Recent mass&#8208;spectrometry based analyses of the &#8220;ADP&#8208;ribosylome&#8221; have identified histidine as ADP&#8208;ribose acceptor site. In order to study this modification, a fully synthetic strategy towards &#945;&#8208;configured N(&#964;)&#8208; and N(&#960;)&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated histidine&#8208;containing peptides has been developed. Ribofuranosylated histidine building blocks were obtained via Mukaiyama&#8208;type glycosylation and the building blocks were integrated into an ADP&#8208;ribosylome derived peptide sequence using fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc)&#8208;based solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. On&#8208;resin installation of the ADP moiety was achieved using phosphoramidite chemistry, and global deprotection provided the desired ADP&#8208;ribosylated oligopeptides. The stability under various chemical conditions and resistance against (ADP&#8208;ribosyl) hydrolase&#8208;mediated degradation has been investigated to reveal that the constructs are stable under various chemical conditions and non&#8208;degradable by any of the known ADP&#8208;ribosylhydrolases.

         <title>Quality Control of Mass&#8208;Encoded Nanodevices by Compartmented DNA Origami Frames for Precision Information Coding and Logic Mapping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present mass&#8208;encoded nanodevices in which the arrangement and stoichiometry of mass nanotags are prescribed in compartmented DNA origami frames to generate characteristic mass spectra with multiple well&#8208;defined signal intensities. The exclusivity of mass spectral patterns and orthogonality of multiplexed ion signal responses allow precise information coding and logic mapping.







Abstract
Encoded nanostructures afford an ideal platform carrying multi&#8208;channel signal components for multiplexed assay and information security. However, with the demand on exclusivity and reproducibility of coding signals, precise control on the structure and composition of nanomaterials featuring fully distinguishable signals remains challenging. By using the multiplexing capability of mass spectrometry (MS) and spatial addressability of DNA origami nanostructures, we herein propose a quality control methodology for constructing mass&#8208;encoded nanodevices (namely MNTs&#8208;TDOFs) in the scaffold of compartmented tetrahedral DNA origami frames (TDOFs), in which the arrangement and stoichiometry of four types of mass nanotags (MNTs) can be finely regulated and customized to generate characteristic MS patterns. The programmability of combinatorial MNTs and orthogonality of individual compartments allows further evolution of MNTs&#8208;TDOFs to static tagging agents and dynamic nanoprobes for labeling and sensing of multiple targets. More importantly, structure control at single TDOF level ensures the constancy of prescribed MS outputs, by which a high&#8208;capacity coding system was established for secure information encryption and decryption. In addition to the multiplexed outputs in parallel, the nanodevices could also map logic circuits with interconnected complexity and logic events of c&#8208;Met recognition and dimerization on cell surface for signaling regulation by MS interrogation.

         <title>The Design of a Participatory Peptide Nucleic Acid Duplex Crosslinker to Enhance the Stiffness of Self&#8208;Assembled Peptide Gels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of crosslinking agents to modulate the mechanical properties of peptide&#8208;based gels increases their scope of utility. We report the design, synthesis and utilization of a peptide nucleic acid duplex crosslinker (DCL) that takes part in peptide assembly leading to gel formation while simultaneously installing non&#8208;covalent crosslinks into the higher&#8208;order fibrillar network. DCL represents a new modality in the crosslinker arsenal.







Abstract
Herein, peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) are employed in the design of a participatory duplex PNA&#8208;peptide crosslinking agent. Biophysical and mechanical studies show that crosslinkers present during peptide assembly leading to hydrogelation participate in the formation of fibrils while simultaneously installing crosslinks into the higher&#8208;order network that constitutes the peptide gel. The addition of 2&#8197;mol&#8201;% crosslinker into the assembling system results in a ~100&#8201;% increase in mechanical stiffness without affecting the rate of peptide assembly or the local morphology of fibrils within the gel network. Stiffness enhancement is realized by only affecting change in the elastic component of the viscoelastic gel. A synthesis of the PNA&#8208;peptide duplex crosslinkers is provided that allows facile variation in peptide composition and addresses the notorious hydrophobic content of PNAs. This crosslinking system represents a new tool for modulating the mechanical properties of peptide&#8208;based hydrogels.

         <title>Automated Structural Activity Screening of &#946;&#8208;Diketonate Assemblies with High&#8208;Throughput Ion Mobility&#8208;Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robotically prepared combinatorial libraries of &#946;&#8208;diketonates were analysed with high&#8208;throughput ion mobility&#8208;mass spectrometry. The dynamic ensemble of components and assemblies were directly separated by their topology. Rapid automated analysis of the makeup of the complex samples was achieved without individual peak assignment. The dataset was parsed for assembly activity without first attempting to structurally assign individual species.







Abstract
Embracing complexity in design, metallo&#8208;supramolecular self&#8208;assembly presents an opportunity for fabricating materials of economic significance. The array of accessible supramolecules is alluring, along with favourable energy requirements. Implementation is hampered by an inability to efficiently characterise complex mixtures. The stoichiometry, size, shape, guest binding properties and reactivity of individual components and combinations thereof are inherently challenging to resolve. A large combinatorial library of four transition metals (Fe, Cu, Ni and Zn), and six &#946;&#8208;diketonate ligands at different molar ratios and pH was robotically prepared and directly analysed over multiple timepoints with electrospray ionisation travelling wave ion mobility&#8208;mass spectrometry. The dataset was parsed for self&#8208;assembling activity without first attempting to structurally assign individual species. Self&#8208;assembling systems were readily categorised without manual data&#8208;handling, allowing efficient screening of self&#8208;assembly activity. This workflow clarifies solution phase supramolecular assembly processes without manual, bottom&#8208;up processing. The complex behaviour of the self&#8208;assembling systems was reduced to simpler qualities, which could be automatically processed.

         <title>Divergent Chemo&#8208; and Biocatalytic Route to 16&#946;&#8208;Methylcorticoids: Asymmetric Synthesis of Betamethasone Dipropionate, Clobetasol Propionate, and Beclomethasone Dipropionate</title>

         <dc:description>
A 14&#8211;15 step asymmetric synthesis of 16&#946;&#8208;methylcorticoids is described. The synthesis highlights a Mn&#8208;catalyzed oxidation&#8208;reduction hydration and an innovative enzyme&#8208;catalyzed regioselective &#916;1&#8208;dehydrogenation for the functionalization of the D&#8197;ring and A&#8197;ring, respectively, establishing a versatile platform for the access to various glucocorticoids and related steroids.







Abstract
16&#946;&#8208;Methylcorticoids are among the most important glucocorticoid steroids for the treatment of various dermatological disorders, respiratory infections, and other allergic reactions elicited during inflammatory responses of the human body. Betamethasone dipropionate, clobetasol propionate, and beclomethasone dipropionate are particularly noteworthy for their synthetic intractability. Despite five decades of research, these 16&#946;&#8208;methylcorticoids have remained challenging synthetic targets owing to insurmountable issues of reactivity, selectivity, and cost efficiency associated with all previously explored strategies. We herein report our practicability&#8208;oriented strategy toward the unified stereoselective synthesis of 16&#946;&#8208;methylcorticoids in 12.6&#8211;14.0&#8201;% overall yield from commercially available 9&#945;&#8208;hydroxyandrost&#8208;4&#8208;ene&#8208;3,17&#8208;dione (9&#945;&#8208;OH&#8208;AD). In this approach, the chiral C16&#946;&#8208;Me and C17&#945;&#8208;OH groups of the corticosteroid D ring were installed via a substrate&#8208;controlled diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective Mn&#8208;catalyzed oxidation&#8208;reduction hydration of &#916;4,9(11),16&#8208;triene&#8208;3,20&#8208;dione. The C1&#8722;C2 double bond of the corticosteroid A ring was constructed using an unprecedented engineered 3&#8208;ketosteroid&#8208;&#916;1&#8208;dehydrogenase (MK4&#8208;KstD)&#8208;catalyzed regioselective &#916;1&#8208;dehydrogenation of &#916;4,9(11)&#8208;diene&#8208;3,21&#8208;dione. This strategy provides a general method and a key precursor for the divergent synthesis of a variety of glucocorticoids and related steroidal drugs.

         <title>Cascade In Situ Self&#8208;Assembly and Bioorthogonal Reaction Enable the Enrichment of Photosensitizers and Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors for Pretargeted Cancer Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step tumor&#8208;pretargeted approach for multimodal imaging&#8208;guided cancer theranostics via cascade alkaline phosphatase (ALP)&#8208;mediated in situ self&#8208;assembly and bioorthogonal inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction enhances the accumulation of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (SA&#8208;Tz) and photosensitizers (775NP&#8208;Tz) at the tumor site, efficiently alleviating hypoxic tumors and augmenting synergistic PDT efficacy in vivo.







Abstract
We report here a tumor&#8208;pretargted theranostic approach for multimodality imaging&#8208;guided synergistic cancer PDT by cascade alkaline phosphatase (ALP)&#8208;mediated in situ self&#8208;assembly and bioorthogonal inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction. Using the enzymatic catalysis of ALP that continuously catalyses the dephosphorylation and self&#8208;assembly of trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO)&#8208;bearing P&#8208;FFGd&#8208;TCO, a high density of fluorescent and magnetic TCO&#8208;containing nanoparticles (FMNPs&#8208;TCO) can be synthesized and retained on the membrane of tumor cells. They can act as &#8216;artificial antigens&#8217; amenable to concurrently capture lately administrated tetrazine (Tz)&#8208;decorated PS (775NP&#8208;Tz) and carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitor (SA&#8208;Tz) via the fast IEDDA reaction. This two&#8208;step pretargeting process can further induce FMNPs&#8208;TCO regrowth into microparticles (FMNPs&#8208;775/SA) directly on tumor cell membranes, which is analyzed by bio&#8208;SEM and fluorescence imaging. Thus, efficient enrichment of both SA&#8208;Tz and 775NP&#8208;Tz in tumors can be achieved, allowing to alleviate hypoxia by continuously inhibiting CA activity and improving PDT of tumors. Findings show that subcutaneous HeLa tumors could be completely eradicated and no tumor recurred after irradiation with an 808&#8197;nm laser (0.33&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 10&#8197;min). This pretargeted approach may be applied to enrich other therapeutic agents in tumors to improve targeted therapy.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Diaryl Ethers via NHC Catalyzed Desymmetrization and Following Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The NHC&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of axially chiral diaryl ethers was developed via desymmetrization of prochiral 2&#8208; aryloxyisophthalaldehydes. Mechanistic studies indicate that this process involves NHC&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization followed by kinetic resolution sequence. The utility of this methodology was demonstrated through a broad scope and completed by further late&#8208;stage functionalization.







Abstract
Axially chiral diaryl ethers are present in numerous natural products and bioactive molecules. However, only few catalytic enantioselective approaches have been established to access diaryl ether atropisomers. Herein, we report the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of axially chiral diaryl ethers via desymmetrization of prochiral 2&#8208;aryloxyisophthalaldehydes with aliphatic alcohols, phenol derivatives, and heteroaromatic amines. This reaction features mild reaction conditions, good functional group tolerance, broad substrate scope and excellent enantioselectivity. The utility of this methodology is illustrated by late&#8208;stage functionalization, gram&#8208;scale synthesis, and diverse enantioretentive transformations. Control experiments and DFT calculations support the association of NHC&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization with following kinetic resolution to enhance the enantioselectivity.

         <title>Second Coordination Sphere Effect Shifts CO2 to CO Reduction by Iron Porphyrin from Fe0 to FeI</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;inspired second coordination sphere inducing a multipoint hydrogen bonding network triggers CO2 activation at an earlier stage of the reaction mechanism in CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO electrocatalytic reduction by an iron porphyrin catalyst. Electrochemical and comprehensive spectroscopic investigations supported by DFT calculations revealed an unprecedented change in the active species&#8217; formal oxidation state from Fe(0) to Fe(I).







Abstract
Iron porphyrins are among the most studied molecular catalysts for carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction and their reactivity is constantly being enhanced through the implementation of chemical functionalities in the second coordination sphere inspired by the active sites of enzymes. In this study, we were intrigued to observe that a multipoint hydrogen bonding scheme provided by embarked urea groups could also shift the redox activation step of CO2 from the well&#8208;admitted Fe(0) to the Fe(I) state. Using EPR, resonance Raman, IR and UV&#8208;Visible spectroscopies, we underpinned a two&#8208;electron activation step of CO2 starting from the Fe(I) oxidation state to form, after protonation, an Fe(III)&#8722;COOH species. The addition of another electron and a proton to the latter species converged to the cleavage of a C&#8722;O bond with the loss of water molecule resulting in an Fe(II)&#8722;CO species. DFT analyses of these postulated intermediates are in good agreement with our collected spectroscopic data, allowing us to propose an alternative pathway in the catalytic CO2 reduction with iron porphyrin catalyst. Such a remarkable shift opens new lines of research in the design of molecular catalysts to reach low overpotentials in performing multi&#8208;electronic CO2 reduction catalysis.

         <title>Control of Intermediates and Products by Combining Droplet Reactions and Ion Soft&#8208;Landing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactive charged intermediates, generated via microdroplet&#8208;accelerated reactions, can be mass selected and deposited into layers on surfaces using ion soft&#8208;landing. This combination of two preparative mass spectrometry methods enables controlled bond formation, even between ions of the same polarity.







Abstract
Despite being recognized primarily as an analytical technique, mass spectrometry also has a large potential as a synthetic tool, enabling access to advanced synthetic routes by reactions in charged microdroplets or ionic thin layers. Such reactions are special and proceed primarily at surfaces of droplets and thin layers. Partial solvation of the reactants is usually considered to play an important role for reducing the activation barrier, but many mechanistic details still need to be clarified. In our study, we showcase the synergy between two sequentially applied &#8220;preparative mass spectrometry&#8221; methods: initiating accelerated reactions within microdroplets during electrospray ionization to generate gaseous ionic intermediates in high abundance, which are subsequently mass&#8208;selected and soft&#8208;landed to react with a provided reagent on a substrate. This allows the generation of products at a nanomolar scale, amenable to further characterization. In this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, the contrasting reaction pathways between intrinsically neutral and pre&#8208;charged reagents, respectively, both in microdroplets and in layers generated by ion soft&#8208;landing are investigated. This provides new insights into the role of partially solvated reagents at microdroplet surfaces for increased reaction rates. Additionally, further insights into reactions of ions of the same polarity under various conditions is obtained.

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive Supramolecular Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Metallacycle for Orthogonal Multimode Photopatterning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A system with spatially controlled fluorescence&#8208;resonance energy transfer has been built through the incorporation of a light&#8208;responsive liquid&#8208;crystalline metallacycle and a photochromic spiropyran derivative. This approach enables the realization of orthogonal multimode photopatterning including holographic, fluorescent, and photochromic patterning in one integrated system.







Abstract
The development of multimode photopatterning systems based on supramolecular coordination complexes (SCCs) is considerably attractive in supramolecular chemistry and materials science, because SCCs can serve as promising platforms for the incorporation of multiple functional building blocks. Herein, we report a light&#8208;responsive liquid&#8208;crystalline metallacycle that is constructed by coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. By exploiting its fascinating liquid crystal features, bright emission properties, and facile photocyclization capability, a unique system with spatially&#8208;controlled fluorescence&#8208;resonance energy transfer (FRET) is built through the introduction of a photochromic spiropyran derivative, which led to the realization of the first example of a liquid&#8208;crystalline metallacycle for orthogonal photopatterning in three&#8208;modes, namely holography, fluorescence, and photochromism.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Regulated Active Hydrogen Behavior on Molybdenum Disulfide for Electrochemical Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;mimicking MoS2 model catalyst is used for a fundamental understanding of nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia process. The crystal phase referred to atomic arrangements (1T and 2H phase) is investigated towards catalytic activity. Results show that 1T&#8208;MoS2 produces more active hydrogen on edge S sites at a more positive potential and conducts an effortless reaction pathway, instead of multiple uphill hydrogenation steps performed on 2H&#8208;MoS2.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of nitrate waste is promising for environmental remediation and ammonia preparation. This process includes multiple hydrogenation steps, and thus the active hydrogen behavior on the surface of the catalyst is crucial. The crystal phase referred to the atomic arrangements in crystals has a great effect on active hydrogen, but the influence of the crystal phase on nitrate reduction is still unclear. Herein, enzyme&#8208;mimicking MoS2 in different crystal phases (1T and 2H) are used as models. The Faradaic efficiency of ammonia reaches &#8776;90&#8201;% over 1T&#8208;MoS2, obviously outperforming that of 2H&#8208;MoS2 (27.31&#8201;%). In situ Raman spectra and theoretical calculations reveal that 1T&#8208;MoS2 produces more active hydrogen on edge S sites at a more positive potential and conducts an effortless pathway from nitrate to ammonia instead of multiple energetically demanding hydrogenation steps (such as *HNO to *HNOH) performed on 2H&#8208;MoS2.

         <title>Electron Spin&#8208;Dependent Electrocatalysis for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction in a Chiro&#8208;Self&#8208;Assembled Iron Phthalocyanine Device</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic activity of iron phthalocyanine (FePc) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was highly increased by promoting the chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity effect on FePc axially coordinated by chiral&#8208;peptides (L and D enantiomers). By adjusting the peptides&#8242; handedness and length (chiral C number), the kinetics and thermodynamic factors governing ORR were optimized for developing highly efficient catalysts.







Abstract
The chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity effect (CISS) is a breakthrough phenomenon that has revolutionized the field of electrocatalysis. We report the first study on the electron spin&#8208;dependent electrocatalysis for the oxygen reduction reaction, ORR, using iron phthalocyanine, FePc, a well&#8208;known molecular catalyst for this reaction. The FePc complex belongs to the non&#8208;precious catalysts group, whose active site, FeN4, emulates catalytic centers of biocatalysts such as Cytochrome c. This study presents an experimental platform involving FePc self&#8208;assembled to a gold electrode surface using chiral peptides (L and D enantiomers), i.e., chiro&#8208;self&#8208;assembled FePc systems (CSAFePc). The chiral peptides behave as spin filters axial ligands of the FePc. One of the main findings is that the peptides&#8242; handedness and length in CSAFePc can optimize the kinetics and thermodynamic factors governing ORR. Moreover, the D&#8208;enantiomer promotes the highest electrocatalytic activity of FePc for ORR, shifting the onset potential up to 1.01&#8197;V vs. RHE in an alkaline medium, a potential close to the reversible potential of the O2/H2O couple. Therefore, this work has exciting implications for developing highly efficient and bioinspired catalysts, considering that, in biological organisms, biocatalysts that promote O2 reduction to water comprise L&#8208;enantiomers.

&lt;p&gt;The chiral-induced spin selectivity effect (CISS) is a breakthrough phenomenon that has revolutionized the field of electrocatalysis. We report the first study on the electron spin-dependent electrocatalysis for the oxygen reduction reaction, ORR, using iron phthalocyanine, FePc, a well-known molecular catalyst for this reaction. The FePc complex belongs to the non-precious catalysts group, whose active site, FeN4, emulates catalytic centers of biocatalysts such as Cytochrome c. This study presents an experimental platform involving FePc self-assembled to a gold electrode surface using chiral peptides (L and D enantiomers), i.e., chiro-self-assembled FePc systems (CSAFePc). The chiral peptides behave as spin filters axial ligands of the FePc. One of the main findings is that the peptides&#8242; handedness and length in CSAFePc can optimize the kinetics and thermodynamic factors governing ORR. Moreover, the D-enantiomer promotes the highest electrocatalytic activity of FePc for ORR, shifting the onset potential up to 1.01&#8197;V vs. RHE in an alkaline medium, a potential close to the reversible potential of the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O couple. Therefore, this work has exciting implications for developing highly efficient and bioinspired catalysts, considering that, in biological organisms, biocatalysts that promote O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to water comprise L-enantiomers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A General Method to Access Sterically Encumbered Geminal Bis(boronates) via Formal Umpolung Transformation of Terminal Diboron Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general method for accessing sterically encumbered geminal bis(boronates) was developed based on a formal umpolung strategy. The polarity inversion of the readily available 1,1&#8208;diborylalkanes allows their corresponding &#945;&#8208;halogenated derivatives to undergo a formal substitution with a wide variety of nucleophiles to form C&#8722;C, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;S, and C&#8722;N bonds, featuring excellent tolerance to steric hindrance and functional groups.







Abstract
General methods for the preparation of geminal bis(boronates) are of great interest due to their widespread applications in organic synthesis. While the terminal gem&#8208;diboron compounds are readily accessible, the construction of the sterically encumbered, internal analogues has remained a prominent challenge. Herein, we report a formal umpolung strategy to access these valuable building blocks. The readily available 1,1&#8208;diborylalkanes were first converted into the corresponding &#945;&#8208;halogenated derivatives, which then serve as electrophilic components, undergoing a formal substitution with a diverse array of nucleophiles to form a series of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;S, and C&#8722;N bonds. This protocol features good tolerance to steric hindrance and a wide variety of functional groups and heterocycles. Notably, this strategy can also be extended to the synthesis of diaryl and terminal gem&#8208;diboron compounds, therefore providing a general approach to various types of geminal bis(boronates).

         <title>Porous Single&#8208;crystalline Centimeter&#8208;sized &#945;&#8208;Al2O3 Monoliths for Selective and Durable Non&#8208;oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethane</title>

Here we fabricate porous single&#8208;crystalline &#945;&#8208;Al2O3 monoliths in reduced states and demonstrate selective and durable non&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene over 1000&#8197;h.







Abstract
Alpha alumina (&#945;&#8208;Al2O3) are inert materials with outstanding thermal, chemical and mechanical stability. Herein, we fabricate porous single&#8208;crystalline (PSC) &#945;&#8208;Al2O3 monoliths at centimeter scale to endow them with high catalytic activity while maintaining their stability. We reduce PSC &#945;&#8208;Al2O3 monoliths to create oxygen vacancies in lattice and stabilize them by the ordered lattice to construct unsaturated Al&#8722;O coordination structures for enhancing the catalytic activity. The generation of oxygen vacancy at 18e wyckoff position contributes to the unsaturated Al&#8722;O coordination. As a case study, we demonstrate the outstanding performance with conversion (&#8776;34&#8201;%) and selectivity (&#8776;95&#8201;%) toward non&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene at 700&#8201;&#176;C. We achieve the outstanding performance without obvious degradation even after a continuous operation over 1000&#8197;hours at 700&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>In Situ Vaccination with An Injectable Nucleic Acid Hydrogel for Synergistic Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

By crosslinking PD&#8208;L1 siRNA with a SN38&#8208; and CpG&#8208;containing Y&#8208;motif, an injectable three&#8208;in&#8208;one nucleic acid hydrogel was synthesized and performed as an in situ cancer vaccine. Upon injection, the obtained hydrogel strongly induced ICD effects, promoted DC maturation, and increased CTL infiltration in tumors, leading to an enhanced antitumor performance of immunotherapy.







Abstract
Recently, therapeutic cancer vaccines have emerged as promising candidates for cancer immunotherapy. Nevertheless, their efficacies are frequently impeded by challenges including inadequate antigen encapsulation, insufficient immune activation, and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Herein, we report a three&#8208;in&#8208;one hydrogel assembled by nucleic acids (NAs) that can serve as a vaccine to in situ trigger strong immune response against cancer. Through site&#8208;specifically grafting the chemodrug, 7&#8208;ethyl&#8208;10&#8208;hydroxycamptothecin (also known as SN38), onto three component phosphorothioate (PS) DNA strands, a Y&#8208;shaped motif (Y&#8208;motif) with sticky ends is self&#8208;assembled, at one terminus of which an unmethylated cytosine&#8208;phosphate&#8208;guanine (CpG) segment is introduced as an immune agonist. Thereafter, programmed cell death ligand&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;L1) siRNA that performs as immune checkpoint inhibitor is designed as a crosslinker to assemble with the CpG&#8208; and SN38&#8208;containing Y&#8208;motif, resulting in the formation of final NA hydrogel vaccine. With three functional agents inside, the hydrogel can remarkably induce the immunogenic cell death to enhance the antigen presentation, promoting the dendritic cell maturation and effector T lymphocyte infiltration, as well as relieving the immunosuppressive tumor environment. When inoculated twice at tumor sites, the vaccine demonstrates a substantial antitumor effect in melanoma mouse model, proving its potential as a general platform for synergistic cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Particle Engineering via Supramolecular Assembly of Macroscopic Hydrophobic Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing hydrophobic polymer building blocks enables the engineering of metal&#8211;phenolic network (MPN) particle properties (shell thickness, stiffness, permeability), and facilitates incorporation of functional molecules and control of cell association behavior. This study demonstrates the rational design and fabrication of hydrophobic MPNs with expanded utility for diverse applications.







Abstract
Tailoring the hydrophobicity of supramolecular assembly building blocks enables the fabrication of well&#8208;defined functional materials. However, the selection of building blocks used in the assembly of metal&#8211;phenolic networks (MPNs), an emerging supramolecular assembly platform for particle engineering, has been essentially limited to hydrophilic molecules. Herein, we synthesized and applied biscatechol&#8208;functionalized hydrophobic polymers (poly(methyl acrylate) (PMA) and poly(butyl acrylate) (PBA)) as building blocks to engineer MPN particle systems (particles and capsules). Our method allowed control over the shell thickness (e.g., between 10 and 21&#8197;nm), stiffness (e.g., from 10 to 126&#8197;mN&#8201;m&#8722;1), and permeability (e.g., 28&#8211;72&#8201;% capsules were permeable to 500&#8197;kDa fluorescein isothiocyanate&#8208;dextran) of the MPN capsules by selection of the hydrophobic polymer building blocks (PMA or PBA) and by controlling the polymer concentration in the MPN assembly solution (0.25&#8211;2.0&#8197;mM) without additional/engineered assembly processes. Molecular dynamics simulations provided insights into the structural states of the hydrophobic building blocks during assembly and mechanism of film formation. Furthermore, the hydrophobic MPNs facilitated the preparation of fluorescent&#8208;labeled and bioactive capsules through postfunctionalization and also particle&#8211;cell association engineering by controlling the hydrophobicity of the building blocks. Engineering MPN particle systems via building block hydrophobicity is expected to expand their use.

         <title>Designing Sulfate Crystals with Strong Optical Anisotropy through &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Tailoring</title>

The optical anisotropy of sulfate optical materials can be significantly enhanced by strategically tailoring the isotropic [SO4]2&#8722; tetrahedra with &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic modules.







Abstract
Sulfate crystals typically exhibit minimal optical anisotropy due to the near&#8208;zero polarizability anisotropy (&#948;) of [SO4]2&#8722; tetrahedra, arising from highly symmetrical electron clouds. Recent research sought to enhance &#948; via chemical modifications, such as fluorination. However, the resultant crystals often maintain subpar optical anisotropy, frequently with birefringence values below 0.1. In this study, we have uncovered that &#948; can be significantly strengthened by chemically tailoring the tetrahedral [SO4]2&#8722; with anisotropic &#960;&#8208;conjugated modules. This has been demonstrated by several newly proposed S&#8722;O&#8208;Org (Org: &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic species) moieties, which show a sharp increase in &#948; based on theoretical computations. To further validate this experimentally, we synthesized and characterized six new 3&#8208;pyridinesulfonate crystals with the formula A(3&#8208;C5H4NSO3)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xH2O (A=Li, Ag, K, Rb, Cs, and NH4; x=0 and 1). Notably, these materials exhibit strong optical anisotropy, with birefringence values ranging from 0.240 to 0.312 at 546&#8197;nm. These values are approximately 23 to 145.5 times greater than those of corresponding sulfates, and they outperform a vast number of sulfate&#8208;related optical materials, thus verifying the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Furthermore, the title compounds exhibit diverse microstructure peculiarities influenced by the size and binding natures of the counter cations.

         <title>Main&#8208;chain Macromolecular Hydrazone Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Installation of hydrazone photoswitches as repeating units into a polymer main chain allows controlling the hydrodynamic volume changes upon photoisomerization by carefully engineering the location where the photoswitch is covalently weaved into the polymer backbone.







Abstract
Hydrazones&#8212;consisting of a dynamic imine bond and an acidic NH proton&#8212;have recently emerged as versatile photoswitches underpinned by their ability to form thermally bistable isomers, (Z) and (E), respectively. Herein, we introduce two photoresponsive homopolymers containing structurally different hydrazones as main&#8208;chain repeating units, synthesized via head&#8208;to&#8208;tail Acyclic Diene METathesis (ADMET) polymerization. Their key difference lies in the hydrazone design, specifically the location of the aliphatic arm connecting the rotor of the hydrazone photoswitch to the aliphatic polymer backbone. Critically, we demonstrate that their main photoresponsive property, i.e., their hydrodynamic volume, changes in opposite directions upon photoisomerization (&#955;=410&#8197;nm) in dilute solution. Further, the polymers&#8212;independent of the design of the individual hydrazone monomer&#8212;feature a photoswitchable glass transition temperature (Tg) by close to 10&#8201;&#176;C. The herein established design strategy allows to photochemically manipulate macromolecular properties by simple structural changes.

         <title>Bio&#8208;inspired Double Angstrom&#8208;Scale Confinement in Ti&#8208;deficient Ti0.87O2 Nanosheet Membranes for Ultrahigh&#8208;performance Osmotic Power Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design a Ti&#8208;deficient Ti0.87O2 nanosheet membrane with biological double angstrom&#8208;scale confinement (DAC) ion&#8208;permselective channels, named DAC&#8208;Ti0.87O2, for high&#8208;efficiency osmotic power generators. Benefiting from the precisely designed DAC ion&#8208;permselective channels, the DAC&#8208;Ti0.87O2 membrane achieves an unprecedented power density of up to 17.8&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 by mixing 0.5/0.01&#8197;M NaCl solution, far exceeding the reported macroscopic&#8208;scale membranes.







Abstract
Osmotic power, a clean energy source, can be harvested from the salinity difference between seawater and river water. However, the output power densities are hampered by the trade&#8208;off between ion selectivity and ion permeability. Here we propose an effective strategy of double angstrom&#8208;scale confinement (DAC) to design ion&#8208;permselective channels with enhanced ion selectivity and permeability simultaneously. The fabricated DAC&#8208;Ti0.87O2 membranes possess both Ti atomic vacancies and an interlayer free spacing of &#8776;2.2&#8197;&#197;, which not only generates a profitable confinement effect for Na+ ions to enable high ion selectivity but also induces a strong interaction with Na+ ions to benefit high ion permeability. Consequently, when applied to osmotic power generation, the DAC&#8208;Ti0.87O2 membranes achieved an ultrahigh power density of 17.8&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 by mixing 0.5/0.01&#8197;M NaCl solution and up to 114.2&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 with a 500&#8208;fold salinity gradient, far exceeding all the reported macroscopic&#8208;scale membranes. This work highlights the potential of the construction of DAC ion&#8208;permselective channels for two&#8208;dimensional materials in high&#8208;performance nanofluidic energy systems.

         <title>Reactivity of [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;As5)] towards Carbenes, Silylenes and Germylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reaction of [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;As5)] (Cp*=C5Me5) with carbenes gives unique adducts, while its reaction with CAACs affords a novel CAAC&#8208;stabilized As6 sawhorse compound. With silylenes and germylenes, unprecedented norbornadiene&#8208;like heteroatomic As6EL (E=Si, Ge; L=PhC(NtBu)2) ligands are accessible.







Abstract
The reaction behavior of [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;As5)] (I) (Cp*=C5Me5) towards carbenes and their heavier analogs was investigated. The reaction of I with NHCs (NHCs=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes) results in the first substitution products of polyarsenic ligand complexes by NHCs [Cp*Fe(&#951;4&#8208;As5NHC)] (1&#8201;a: NHC=IMe=1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethylimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, 1&#8201;b: NHC=IMes=1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene). In contrast, the reaction of I with EtCAAC (EtCAAC=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;4,4&#8208;diethyl&#8208;2,2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;pyrrolidin&#8208;5&#8208;ylidene) leads to a fragmentation and the formation of an unprecedented As6&#8208;sawhorse&#8208;type compound [As2(AsEtCAAC)4] (2). The reaction of (LE)2 (L=PhC(NtBu)2; E=Si, Ge) with I resulted in a rearrangement and an insertion of LE fragments, forming unique silicon&#8208; (4: [Cp*Fe(&#951;4&#8208;As4SiL)], 5&#8201;a: [Cp*Fe(&#951;4&#8208;As6SiL)) and germanium&#8208;containing (5&#8201;b: [Cp*Fe(&#951;4&#8208;As6GeL)) cyclic polyarsenic ligand complexes.

         <title>Fluorination Strategy Towards Symmetry Breaking of Boron&#8208;centered Tetrahedron for Poly&#8208;fluorinated Optical Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ten fluorooxoborates with rare tri&#8208;fluorinated [BF3X] (X=O and CH3) tetrahedra were found using the bifluoride salts as a strong source of fluorine. We identified the optical properties of the organofluorinated group [CH3BF3] and their potential for nonlinear optics for the first time. Additionally, the mixed anion technique and the anion replacement strategy were used to synthesize two isomorphic examples of non&#8208;centrosymmetric nitrates.







Abstract
Borate crystals can be chemically and functionally modified by the fluorination strategy, which encourages the identification of emerging fluorooxoborates with a structure and set of characteristics not seen in any other oxide parents. However, the bulk of fluorooxoborates have been found accidentally, rational methods of synthesis are required, particularly for the infrequently occurring poly&#8208;fluorinated components. Herein, we reported the use of bifluoride salts as a potent source of fluorine to prepare fluorooxoborates that contain rarely tri&#8208;fluorinated [BF3X] (X=O and CH3) tetrahedra and eleven compounds were found. We identified the optical properties of the organofluorinated group [CH3BF3] and their potential for nonlinear optics for the first time. Among these, two non&#8208;centrosymmetric components hold potential for the production of 266&#8197;nm harmonic coherent light for nonlinear optics, and more crucially, have the benefit of growing large size single crystals. Our study establishes experimental conditions for the coexistence of the diverse functional groups, enabling the production of poly&#8208;fluorinated optical crystals.

         <title>Highly Selective Ammonia Oxidation on BiVO4 Photoanodes Co&#8208;catalyzed by Trace Amounts of Copper Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simply introducing trace amounts of Cu ions into ammonia solutions can substantially improve the photoelectrochemical performance for ammonia oxidation reaction on BiVO4 photoanodes, which originates from the activation of N&#8722;H bonds via the cooperation of BiVO4 surface effect and Cu&#8208;induced coordination effect. This simple activation strategy is also applicable to other (photo)electrocatalysts for ammonia oxidation reaction.







Abstract
High&#8208;efficient photoelectrocatalytic direct ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) conducted on semiconductor photoanodes remains a substantial challenge. Herein, we develop a strategy of simply introducing ppm levels of Cu ions (0.5&#8211;10&#8197;mg/L) into NH3 solutions to significantly improve the AOR photocurrent of bare BiVO4 photoanodes from 3.4 to 6.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;VRHE, being close to the theoretical maximum photocurrent of BiVO4 (7.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The surface charge&#8208;separation efficiency has reached 90&#8201;% under a low bias of 0.8&#8197;VRHE. This AOR exhibits a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 93.8&#8201;% with the water oxidation reaction (WOR) being greatly suppressed. N2 is the main AOR product with FEs of 71.1&#8201;% in aqueous solutions and FEs of 100&#8201;% in non&#8208;aqueous solutions. Through mechanistic studies, we find that the formation of Cu&#8722;NH3 complexes possesses preferential adsorption on BiVO4 surfaces and efficiently competes with WOR. Meanwhile, the cooperation of BiVO4 surface effect and Cu&#8208;induced coordination effect activates N&#8722;H bonds and accelerates the first rate&#8208;limiting proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer for AOR. This simple strategy is further extended to other photoanodes and electrocatalysts.

         <title>Synthesis and Photophysical Properties of Luminescent Phenothiazinyl Merocyanine Substituted Polyacetylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of soluble phenothiazinyl merocyanine substituted polyacetylenes have been readily synthesized by rhodium&#8208;catalyzed polymerization of the corresponding 3&#8208;ethynyl phenothiazines. These polyacetylenes with conjugatively ligated merocyanines are emissive in solution and in the solid state and also show emission solvatochromism.







Abstract
A new generation of soluble phenothiazinyl merocyanine substituted polyacetylenes can be readily synthesized by rhodium&#8208;catalyzed polymerization of the corresponding 3&#8208;ethynyl phenothiazines, accessible by Sonogashira coupling and Knoevenagel condensation. UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy of 7&#8208;acceptor&#8208;substituted phenothiazinyl polyacetylenes reveal that these polyacetylenes with conjugatively ligated merocyanines are luminescent in solution with positive emission solvatochromism and, in some cases, with distinct solid&#8208;state luminescence.

         <title>Membranes based on Covalent Organic Frameworks through Green and Scalable Interfacial Polymerization using Ionic Liquids for Antibiotic Desalination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new green and industrially adaptable scraping&#8208;assisted interfacial polymerization (SAIP) technique was reported to fabricate TpPa COF membranes.This approach yielded a large&#8208;area, continuous COF membrane (19&#215;25&#8197;cm2). The resulting membrane exhibited an unprecedented combination of high permeance and antibiotic desalination efficiency.







Abstract
Covalent organic framework (COF) membranes featuring uniform topological structures and devisable functions, show huge potential in water purification and molecular separation. Nevertheless, the inability of uniform COF membranes to be produced on an industrial scale and their nonenvironmentally friendly fabrication method are the bottleneck preventing their industrial applications. Herein, we report a new green and industrially adaptable scraping&#8208;assisted interfacial polymerization (SAIP) technique to fabricate scalable and uniform TpPa COF membranes. The process used non&#8208;toxic and low&#8208;volatility ionic liquids (ILs) as organic phase instead of conventional organic solvents for interfacial synthesis of TpPa COF layer on a support membrane, which can simultaneously achieve the purposes of (i) improving the greenness of membrane&#8208;forming process and (ii) fabricating a robust membrane that can function beyond the conventional membranes. This approach yields a large&#8208;area, continuous COF membrane (19&#215;25&#8197;cm2) with a thickness of 78&#8197;nm within a brief period of 2&#8197;minutes. The resulting membrane exhibited an unprecedented combination of high permeance (48.09&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 bar&#8722;1) and antibiotic desalination efficiency (e.g., NaCl/adriamycin separation factor of 41.8), which is superior to the commercial benchmarking membranes.

         <title>Vacancy&#8208;induced catalytic mechanism for alcohol electrooxidation on nickel&#8208;based electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen vacancy&#8208;induced adsorbed oxygen&#8208;mediated mechanism (VO&#8208;AOM) is essential to the electrooxidation of R&#8722;CHOH&#8722;CH2OH to R&#8722;COOH and HCOOH (VDOR) over nickel&#8208;based catalysts, especially for the C&#8722;C bond cleavage process.







Abstract
Owing to outstanding performances, nickel&#8208;based electrocatalysts are commonly used in electrochemical alcohol oxidation reactions (AORs), and the active phase is usually vacancy&#8208;rich nickel oxide/hydroxide (NiOxHy) species. However, researchers are not aware of the catalytic role of atom vacancy in AORs. Here, we study vacancy&#8208;induced catalytic mechanisms for AORs on NiOxHy species. As to AORs on oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;poor &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2, the only redox mediator is electrooxidation&#8208;induced electrophilic lattice oxygen species, which can only catalyze the dehydrogenation process (e.g., the electrooxidation of primary alcohol to carboxylic acid) instead of the C&#8722;C bond cleavage. Hence, vicinal diol electrooxidation reaction involving the C&#8722;C bond cleavage is not feasible with oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;poor &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2. Only through oxygen vacancy&#8208;induced adsorbed oxygen&#8208;mediated mechanism, can oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich NiOxHy species catalyze the electrooxidation of vicinal diol to carboxylic acid and formic acid accompanied with the C&#8722;C bond cleavage. Crucially, we examine how vacancies and vacancy&#8208;induced catalytic mechanisms work during AORs on NiOxHy species.

Self&#8208;assembly of 2,5&#8208;diformylpyrrole with diamines in the presence of Zn(II)/Cd(II) resulted in the formation of a [2]catenane, trefoil knot, and Borromean rings. The presence of a diiminopyrrole coordination motif rendered all new systems intrinsically flexible, as demonstrated by the combination of NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and computational studies.







Abstract
The use of 2,5&#8208;diformylpyrrole in self&#8208;assembly reactions with diamines and Zn(II)/Cd(II) salts allowed the preparation of [2]catenane, trefoil knot, and Borromean rings. The intrinsically dynamic nature of the diiminopyrrole motif rendered all of the formed assemblies intramolecularly flexible. The presence of diiminopyrrole revealed new coordination motifs and influenced the host&#8211;guest chemistry of the systems, as illustrated by hexafluorophosphate encapsulation by Borromean rings.

         <title>A Photoswitchable Macrocycle Controls Anion&#8208;Templated Pseudorotaxane Formation and Axle Relocalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anion&#8208;templated pseudorotaxane formation is effectively controlled by macrocycles that expand and contract in response to a light stimulus. Upon light&#8208;induced threading and dethreading, the axle component can dynamically relocate between the macrocycle and a secondary isophthalamide host. This work is a stepping stone towards signal processing in multicomponent supramolecular systems.







Abstract
Important biological processes, such as signaling and transport, are regulated by dynamic binding events. The development of artificial supramolecular systems in which binding between different components is controlled could help emulate such processes. Herein, we describe stiff&#8208;stilbene&#8208;containing macrocycles that can be switched between (Z)&#8208; and (E)&#8208;isomers by light, as demonstrated by UV/Vis and 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. The (Z)&#8208;isomers can be effectively threaded by pyridinium halide axles to give pseudorotaxane complexes, as confirmed by 1H&#8197;NMR titration studies and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The overall stability of these complexes can be tuned by varying the templating counteranion. However, upon light&#8208;induced isomerization to the (E)&#8208;isomer, the threading capability is drastically reduced. The axle component, in addition, can form a heterodimeric complex with a secondary isophthalamide host. Therefore, when all components are combined, light irradiation triggers axle exchange between the macrocycle and this secondary host, which has been monitored by 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and simulated computationally.

         <dc:description>
Novel divergent excited state reactivity of aryl&#8208;maleimides undergoing an unexpected [2+4]&#8208;photodimerization is presented with detailed mechanistic rationale. The stereochemistry of the photodimer formed is complementary to the product observed under thermal conditions and is dictated by the type of non&#8208;bonding interactions prevalent in the photoexcited reactant.







Abstract
Aryl&#8208;maleimides undergo a novel [2+4]&#8208;photodimerization instead of the expected [2+2]&#8208;photodimerization under both direct irradiation with visible light and under sensitized energy transfer conditions. This new excited state reactivity in aryl&#8208;maleimides is deciphered through photochemical, photophysical, and spectroscopic studies. The stereochemistry of the photodimer depends on the type of non&#8208;bonding interactions prevalent during photodimerization which is in turn dictated by the substituents on the maleimide ring. More importantly, the stereochemistry of the photodimer formed is complementary to the product observed under thermal conditions.

         <title>Can Magnetic Dipole Transition Moment Be Engineered?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density Functional Theory (DFT) in combination with clustering analysis allowed the identification of a common transition in helical compounds, whose magnetic dipole transition moment |m| and the inner area have a linear relationship. The findings provide a tool for a rationalized design of helical organic molecules with improved chiroptical properties.







Abstract
The development of chiral compounds with enhanced chiroptical properties is an important challenge to improve device applications. To that end, an optimization of the electric and magnetic dipole transition moments of the molecule is necessary. Nevertheless, the relationship between chemical structure and such quantum mechanical properties is not always clear. That is the case of magnetic dipole transition moment (m) for which no general trends for its optimization have been suggested. In this work we propose a general rationalization for improving the magnitude of m in different families of chiral compounds. Performing a clustering analysis of hundreds of transitions, we have been able to identify a single group in which |m| value is maximized along the helix axis. More interestingly, we have found an accurate linear relationship (up to R2=0.994) between the maximum value of this parameter and the area of the inner cavity of the helix, thus resembling classical behavior of solenoids. This research provides a tool for the rationalized synthesis of compounds with improved chiroptical responses.

Performing a clustering analysis of hundreds of transitions, we have been able to identify a single group in which |&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;| value is maximized along the helix axis. More interestingly, we have found an accurate linear relationship (up to R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=0.994) between the maximum value of this parameter and the area of the inner cavity of the helix, thus resembling classical behavior of solenoids. This research provides a tool for the rationalized synthesis of compounds with improved chiroptical responses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Carbonyl&#8208; and Nitrogen&#8208;Embedded Multi&#8208;Resonance Emitter with Ultra&#8208;Pure Green Emission and High Electroluminescence Efficiencies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>

A C=O/N&#8208;embedded green multi&#8208;resonance emitter, which features two acridone units incorporated in a sterically protected 11&#8208;ring fused core skeleton, is designed and successfully synthesized. The emitter exhibits leading electroluminescent&#8208;device performance among C=O/N&#8208;based green&#8208;emissive MR systems, achieving an external quantum efficiency of up to 37.2&#8201;%, a full width at half maximum of merely 0.11&#8197;eV (24&#8197;nm), and a color coordinate of (0.20, 0.73).







Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters with narrow emission spectra have garnered significant attention in future organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) displays. However, current C=O/N&#8208;embedded MR&#8208;TADF systems still lack satisfactory performance in terms of electroluminescence bandwidths and external quantum efficiencies (EQEs). In this study, a C=O/N&#8208;embedded green MR&#8208;TADF emitter, featuring two acridone units incorporated in a sterically protected 11&#8208;ring fused core skeleton, is successfully synthesized through finely controlling the reaction selectivity. The superior combination of multiple intramolecular fusion and steric wrapping strategies in the design of the emitter not only imparts an extremely narrow emission spectrum and a high fluorescence quantum yield to the emitter but also mitigates aggregation&#8208;induced spectral broadening and fluorescence quenching. Therefore, the emitter exhibits leading green OLED performance among C=O/N&#8208;based MR&#8208;TADF systems, achieving an EQE of up to 37.2&#8201;%, a full width at half maximum of merely 0.11&#8197;eV (24&#8197;nm), and a Commission Internationale de l&#8242;&#201;clairage coordinate of (0.20, 0.73). This study marks a significant advance in the realization of ideal C=O/N&#8208;based MR&#8208;TADF emitters and holds profound implications for the design and synthesis of other MR&#8208;TADF systems.

         <title>A Fluorinated Solid&#8208;state&#8208;electrolyte Interface Layer Guiding Fast Zinc&#8208;ion Oriented Deposition in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>

We developed a fluorinated solid electrolyte interfacial layer to guide the oriented deposition of zinc ions along the (002) crystal plane of Zn anode to inhibit the growth of zinc dendrites and accelerate the migration of zinc ions at the anode interface during cycling and improve the electrochemical performance of the battery.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries are gaining popularity due to their high energy density and environmental friendliness. However, random deposition of zinc ions on the anode and sluggish migration of zinc ions on the interface would lead to the growth of zinc dendrites and poor cycling performance. To address these challenges, we developed a fluorinated solid&#8208;state&#8208;electrolyte interface layer composed of Ca5(PO4)3F/Zn3(PO4)2 via an in situ ion exchange strategy to guide zinc&#8208;ion oriented deposition and fast zinc ion migration on the anode during cycling. The introduction of Ca5(PO4)3F (FAP) can increase the nucleation sites of zinc ions and guide the oriented deposition of zinc ions along the (002) crystal plane, while the in situ formation of Zn3(PO4)2 during cycling can accelerate the migration of zinc ions. Benefited from our design, the assembled Zn//V2O5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O batteries based on FAP&#8208;protected Zn anode (FAP&#8208;Zn) achieve a higher capacity retention of 84&#8201;% (220&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) than that of bare&#8208;Zn based batteries, which have a capacity retention of 23&#8201;% (97&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) at 3.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 800 cycles. This work provides a new solution for the rational design and development of the solid&#8208;state electrolyte interface layer to achieve high&#8208;performance zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>RAFT Polymerisation by the Radical Decarboxylation of Carboxylic Acids
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controlled grafting of acrylate and acrylamide polymers from small molecule and polymer substrates has been achieved via the radical decarboxylation of carboxylic acids. These reactions proceed with high efficiency and low dispersity, giving highly functionalised polymers in a single step.







Abstract
The controlled grafting of polymers from small&#8208; and macro&#8208;molecular substrates is an essential process for many advanced polymer applications. This usually requires the pre&#8208;functionalisation of substrates with an appropriate functional group, such as a RAFT agent or ATRP initiator, which requires additional synthetic steps. In this paper, we describe the direct grafting of RAFT polymers from carboxylate containing small molecules and polymers via photochemical radical decarboxylation. This method utilises the innate functional groups present in the substrates, and achieves efficient polymer initiation in a single step with excellent control of molecular weight and dispersity.

         <title>Accelerated Redox Reactions Enable Stable Tin&#8208;Lead Mixed Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A V3+/V2+ redox couple was developed to accelerate the spontaneous redox reactions between Sn4+ and Pb0, enabling the perpetual regeneration of Sn2+ and Pb2+ for self&#8208;healing tin&#8208;lead mixed perovskites under light soaking. The target vanadium&#8208;containing tin&#8208;lead mixed perovskite (V&#8722;Sn&#8722;Pb) solar cells showed substantially improved durability over 1000&#8197;hours under operation.







Abstract
The facile oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ poses an inherent challenge that limits the efficiency and stability of tin&#8208;lead mixed (Sn&#8722;Pb) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and all&#8208;perovskite tandem devices. In this work, we discover the sustainable redox reactions enabling self&#8208;healing Sn&#8722;Pb perovskites, where their intractable oxidation degradation can be recovered to their original state under light soaking. Quantitative and operando spectroscopies are used to investigate the redox chemistry, revealing that metallic Pb0 from the photolysis of perovskite reacts with Sn4+ to regenerate Pb2+ and Sn2+ spontaneously. Given the sluggish redox reaction kinetics, V3+/V2+ ionic pair is designed as an effective redox shuttle to accelerate the recovery of Sn&#8722;Pb perovskites from oxidation. The target Sn&#8722;Pb PSCs enabled by V3+/V2+ ionic pair deliver an improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.22&#8201;% and excellent device lifespan, retaining nearly 90&#8201;% of its initial PCE after maximum power point tracking under light for 1,000&#8197;hours.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free B&#8722;B Dehydrocoupling Reaction of a Simple Borane Adduct: Convenient Access to a Nucleophilic Diborane(4)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Generally, the formation of a B&#8722;B bond is accomplished by reduction of a haloborane. Here, we report a metal&#8208;free B&#8722;B dehydrocoupling reaction starting with a simple, readily available borane adduct. A detailed mechanistical examination paves the way for a rational approach to thermal B&#8722;B dehydrocoupling reactions.







Abstract
The selective formation of homonuclear bonds is of key importance in synthetic chemistry. Especially, dehydrocoupling reactions are attractive as ecologically and economically friendly alternatives to established reductive bond forming reactions, since they do not require the use of stoichiometric amounts of a reducing reagent and produce only valuable dihydrogen as by&#8208;product. Here, we report on a metal&#8208;free B&#8722;B dehydrocoupling reaction that starts directly from a simple, easily accessible BH3 adduct, providing convenient access to a new nucleophilic dihydridodiborane in excellent yield. The dihydridodiborane in turn activates dihydrogen, allowing to obtain quantitatively the dideuteridodiborane from the dihydridodiborane by D2 activation. On the basis of detailed quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, the mechanism of this unprecedented reaction is elucidated. Some key points that are essential for metal&#8208;free dehydrocoupling are disclosed, paving the way for their systematic evaluation and application.

         <title>Symmetry Breaking Enhancing the Activity of Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction on an Icosahedron&#8208;Kernel Cluster by Cu Atoms Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the Au13Cux family, the effects of the controllable structure symmetry&#8208;breaking on the activity of CO2 reduction were investigated. Importantly, the most efficient clustered catalysts for CO2 reduction to date were prepared in this family. This work opens the way for the design of efficient CO2 reduction catalyst and the controlled tailoring of the catalytic active sites.







Abstract
Recently, CO2 hydrogenation had a new breakthrough resulting from the design of catalysts to effectively activate linear CO2 with symmetry&#8208;breaking sites. However, understanding the relationship between symmetry&#8208;breaking sites and catalytic activity at the atomic level is still a great challenge. In this study, a set of gold&#8208;copper alloy Au13Cux (x=0&#8211;4) nanoclusters were used as research objects to show the symmetry&#8208;controlled breaking structure on the surface of nanoclusters with the help of manipulability of the Cu atoms. Among them, Au13Cu3 nanocluster displays the highest degree of symmetry&#8208;breaking on its crystal structure compared with the other nanoclusters in the family. Where the three copper atoms occupying the surface of the icosahedral kernel unevenly with one copper atom is coordinately unsaturated (CuS2 motif relative to CuS3 motif). As expected, Au13Cu3 has an excellent hydrogenation activity of CO2, in which the current density is as high as 70&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (&#8722;0.97&#8197;V) and the maximum FECO reaches 99&#8201;% at &#8722;0.58&#8197;V. Through the combination of crystal structures and theoretical calculations, the excellent catalytic activity of Au13Cu3 is revealed to be indeed closely related to its asymmetric structure.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Anhydrous Rare&#8208;Earth Trichlorides from their Oxides in Chloridoaluminate Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anhydrous rare&#8208;earth trichlorides RECl3 with high purity and yield are obtained by reacting rare&#8208;earth oxides RE2O3 with aluminum chloride AlCl3 containing ionic liquids at 175&#8201;&#176;C. The easy&#8208;to&#8208;perform process provides a reliable and scalable alternative to the production of these difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access anhydrous chlorides. In contrast to previous approaches, neither high temperatures nor highly toxic substances are required.







Abstract
Wide applications of anhydrous rare&#8208;earth (RE) trichlorides RECl3 in organometallic chemistry, for the synthesis of optical and magnetic materials, and as catalysts require a facile approach for their synthesis. The known methods use or produce toxic substances, are complicated and have limited reliability and upscaling. It has been shown that task&#8208;specific ionic liquids (ILs) can dissolve many metal oxides without special reaction conditions at moderate temperature, making the metals accessible to downstream chemistry. Using imidazolium chloridoaluminate ILs, pure crystalline anhydrous RECl3 (RE=La&#8722;Nd, Sm&#8722;Dy) can be synthesized in one step from RE oxides in high yield. The Lewis acidic IL acts as solvent and reaction partner. The by&#8208;product [Al4O2Cl10]2&#8722;, which was detected spectroscopically, remains in solution. The reacted IL can be removed quantitatively by washing. ILs with various imidazolium cations and AlCl3 content and the effect of temperature and reaction time were tested.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Induced Heteromorphosis Multi&#8208;Cavity Cages: Tension&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Expansion Strategy for Controllable Enhancement of Complexity in Supramolecular Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strain&#8208;dependent capping strategy was proposed to obtain a series of multi&#8208;cavity cages, where dimetallic double&#8208;cavity cages and triple&#8208;cavity cages were formed through the geometric matching and the strain&#8208;induced tension, respectively. This is the first time that discrete supramolecular cages with three cavities have been achieved through the application of molecular strain.







Abstract
Coordinative supramolecular cages with adjustable cavities have found extensive applications in various fields, but the cavity modification strategies for multi&#8208;functional structures are still challenging. Here, we present a tension&#8208;driven self&#8208;expansion strategy for construction of multi&#8208;cavity cages with high structural complexity. Under the regulation of strain&#8208;induced capping ligands, unprecedented heteromorphosis triple&#8208;cavity cages S2/S4 were obtained based on a metallo&#8208;organic ligand (MOL) scaffold. The heteromorphosis cages exhibited significant higher cavity diversity than the homomorphous double&#8208;cavity cages S1/S3; all of the cages were thoroughly characterized through various analytical techniques including (1D and 2D) NMR, ESI&#8208;MS, TWIM&#8208;MS, AFM, and SAXS analyses. Furthermore, the encapsulation of porphyrin in the cavities of these multi&#8208;cavity cages were investigated. This research opens up new possibilities for the architecture of heteromorphosis supramolecular cages via precisely controlled &#8220;scaffold&#8208;capping&#8221; assembly with preorganized ligands, which could have potential applications in the development of multifunctional structures with higher complexity.

The RuNi SAAs on MXene combine the multiple advantages of NPs, SAC, and MXene to promote rapid dehydrogenation of AB hydrolysis. RuNiSAA&#8208;3&#8722;Ti3C2Tx with an optimal d&#8208;band center achieves the highest activity (333&#8197;L&#8201;min&#8722;1&#8201;gRu&#8722;1) toward AB hydrolysis.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom alloys (SAAs), combining the advantages of single&#8208;atom and nanoparticles (NPs), play an extremely significant role in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Nevertheless, understanding the catalytic mechanism of SAAs in catalysis reactions remains a challenge compared with single atoms and NPs. Herein, ruthenium&#8208;nickel SAAs (RuNiSAAs) synthesized by embedding atomically dispersed Ru in Ni NPs are anchored on two&#8208;dimensional Ti3C2Tx MXene. The RuNiSAA&#8208;3&#8722;Ti3C2Tx catalysts exhibit unprecedented activity for hydrogen evolution from ammonia borane (AB, NH3BH3) hydrolysis with a mass&#8208;specific activity (rmass) value of 333&#8197;L&#8201;min&#8722;1&#8201;gRu&#8722;1. Theoretical calculations reveal that the anchoring of SAAs on Ti3C2Tx optimizes the dissociation of AB and H2O as well as the binding ability of H* intermediates during AB hydrolysis due to the d&#8208;band structural modulation caused by the alloying effect and metal&#8208;supports interactions (MSI) compared with single atoms and NPs. This work provides useful design principles for developing and optimizing efficient hydrogen&#8208;related catalysts and demonstrates the advantages of SAAs over NPs and single atoms in energy catalysis.

         <dc:description>
A design strategy for significantly enhancing the polarizability anisotropy of isotropic tetrahedra in sulfate crystals is reported by Zhiyong Bai and Kang Min Ok in their Research Article (e202315311). This strategy involves chemically alternating tetrahedral [SO4]2&#8722; units with &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic groups. Experimental validation of the approach utilized 3&#8208;pyridinesulfonate anion functional building blocks for crystal synthesis.

Discovering new ways to increase the activity of iron phthalocyanine (FePc) in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is an exciting goal in the electrocatalysis field. In their Research Article (e202315146), Rub&#233;n O&#241;ate, Alexis Aspee, Ingrid Ponce et&#8197;al. present an innovative approach, combining the fundamental principles of electrocatalysis and molecular electronics, to increase the ORR performance by exploiting electron transport phenomena in chiro&#8208;self&#8208;assembled FePc nanostructures, such as the chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity effect. This study establishes new guidelines for rationally designing highly efficient electrocatalytic devices.

Single&#8208;atom transition metals present extraordinary activity but are hard to be synthesized and stabilized. In their Research Article (e202312292), Jiafeng Yu, Anna Zimina, Jian Sun et&#8197;al. created SiO2&#8208;stabilized single&#8208;site Zr species by the flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) method, unlocking a dual&#8208;channel pathway for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol reaction. A &#8220;seesaw effect&#8221; limitation between the competitive formate and RWGS+CO&#8208;hydro pathways was broken. The highest overall methanol productivity was achieved when two pathways strike a balance.

         <title>Novel Biocatalysts from Specialized Metabolism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymes are increasingly valuable as biocatalysts in synthetic chemistry. Many novel biocatalysts have emerged from the study of secondary metabolism, where rare and unusual reactions take place. In this review, we explore biocatalysts that address various synthetic challenges, including cyclization, C&#8722;H functionalization, and cross&#8208;coupling, among others, offering unique opportunities for green chemistry.







Abstract
Enzymes are increasingly recognized as valuable (bio)catalysts that complement existing synthetic methods. However, the range of biotransformations used in the laboratory is limited. Here we give an overview on the biosynthesis&#8208;inspired discovery of novel biocatalysts that address various synthetic challenges. Prominent examples from this dynamic field highlight remarkable enzymes for protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free amide formation and modification, control of pericyclic reactions, stereoselective hetero&#8208; and polycyclizations, atroposelective aryl couplings, site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H activations, introduction of ring strain, and N&#8722;N bond formation. We also explore unusual functions of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, radical SAM&#8208;dependent enzymes, flavoproteins, and enzymes recruited from primary metabolism, which offer opportunities for synthetic biology, enzyme engineering, directed evolution, and catalyst design.

         <title>How Acyl Carrier Proteins (ACPs) Direct Fatty Acid and Polyketide Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Megasynthases are responsible for producing primary metabolites and complex natural products. The final products are built in a stepwise process in which small acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) play a central role as they shuttle the growing intermediates between the different catalytic domains. This Review provides an overview of the current understanding and proposes a mechanism for the programming of the ACP movement in megasynthases.







Abstract
Megasynthases, such as type&#8197;I fatty acid and polyketide synthases (FASs and PKSs), are multienzyme complexes responsible for producing primary metabolites and complex natural products. Fatty acids (FAs) and polyketides (PKs) are built by assembling and modifying small acyl moieties in a stepwise manner. A central aspect of FA and PK biosynthesis involves the shuttling of substrates between the domains of the multienzyme complex. This essential process is mediated by small acyl carrier proteins (ACPs). The ACPs must navigate to the different catalytic domains within the multienzyme complex in a particular order to guarantee the fidelity of the biosynthesis pathway. However, the precise mechanisms underlying ACP&#8208;mediated substrate shuttling, particularly the factors contributing to the programming of the ACP movement, still need to be fully understood. This Review illustrates the current understanding of substrate shuttling, including concepts of conformational and specificity control, and proposes a confined ACP movement within type&#8197;I megasynthases.

         <title>New Frontiers in Organosodium Chemistry as Sustainable Alternatives to Organolithium Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With demand for lithium soaring due to its escalating use in energy applications, the heavier organosodium compounds have started to be considered as alternatives in synthesis. Recent reports have tackled their solubility problems, tamed their high reactivity and studied their intermediates constitution, accessing now transformations that were not possible with organolithiums, and opening new vistas for the use of these organosodium reagents.







Abstract
With their highly reactive respective C&#8722;Na and N&#8722;Na bonds, organosodium and sodium amide reagents could be viewed as obvious replacements or even superior reagents to the popular, widely utilised organolithiums. However, they have seen very limited applications in synthesis due mainly to poor solubility in common solvents and their limited stability. That notwithstanding in recent years there has been a surge of interest in bringing these sustainable metal reagents into the forefront of organometallics in synthesis. Showcasing the growth in utilisation of organosodium complexes within several areas of synthetic chemistry, this Minireview discusses promising new methods that have been recently reported with the goal of taming these powerful reagents. Special emphasis is placed on coordination and aggregation effects in these reagents which can impart profound changes in their solubility and reactivity.

     alt="New Frontiers in Organosodium Chemistry as Sustainable Alternatives to Organolithium Reagents"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With demand for lithium soaring due to its escalating use in energy applications, the heavier organosodium compounds have started to be considered as alternatives in synthesis. Recent reports have tackled their solubility problems, tamed their high reactivity and studied their intermediates constitution, accessing now transformations that were not possible with organolithiums, and opening new vistas for the use of these organosodium reagents.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With their highly reactive respective C&#8722;Na and N&#8722;Na bonds, organosodium and sodium amide reagents could be viewed as obvious replacements or even superior reagents to the popular, widely utilised organolithiums. However, they have seen very limited applications in synthesis due mainly to poor solubility in common solvents and their limited stability. That notwithstanding in recent years there has been a surge of interest in bringing these sustainable metal reagents into the forefront of organometallics in synthesis. Showcasing the growth in utilisation of organosodium complexes within several areas of synthetic chemistry, this Minireview discusses promising new methods that have been recently reported with the goal of taming these powerful reagents. Special emphasis is placed on coordination and aggregation effects in these reagents which can impart profound changes in their solubility and reactivity. Differences in observed reactivity between more nucleophilic aryl and alkyl sodium reagents and the less nucleophilic but highly basic sodium amides are discussed along with current mechanistic understanding of their reactivities. Overall, this review aims to inspire growth in this exciting field of research to allow for the integration of organosodium complexes within common important synthetic transformations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual Nanoparticle Conjugates for Highly Sensitive and Versatile Sensing Using 19F Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel dual nanoparticle conjugate sensor (DNCThr) for visualizing thrombin in live mice by fluorine&#8208;19 magnetic resonance imaging. DNCThr consists of mesoporous silica&#8208;coated perfluorocarbon nanoparticles (19F&#8208;MSNs) linked to superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) via an aptamer and a complementary DNA strand. Target&#8208;induced dissociation results in particle separation and robust signal turn&#8208;on.







Abstract
Fluorine magnetic resonance imaging (19F MRI) has emerged as an attractive alternative to conventional 1H MRI due to enhanced specificity deriving from negligible background signal in this modality. We report a dual nanoparticle conjugate (DNC) platform as an aptamer&#8208;based sensor for use in 19F MRI. DNC consists of core&#8211;shell nanoparticles with a liquid perfluorocarbon core and a mesoporous silica shell (19F&#8208;MSNs), which give a robust 19F MR signal, and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) as magnetic quenchers. Due to the strong magnetic quenching effects of SPIONs, this platform is uniquely sensitive and functions with a low concentration of SPIONs (4 equivalents) relative to 19F&#8208;MSNs. The probe functions as a &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; sensor using target&#8208;induced dissociation of DNA aptamers. The thrombin binding aptamer was incorporated as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept (DNCThr), and we demonstrate a significant increase in 19F MR signal intensity when DNCThr is incubated with human &#945;&#8208;thrombin. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept probe is highly versatile and can be adapted to sense ATP and kanamycin as well. Importantly, DNCThr generates a robust 19F MRI &#8220;hot&#8208;spot&#8221; signal in response to thrombin in live mice, establishing this platform as a practical, versatile, and biologically relevant molecular imaging probe.

         <title>Ambient Phosphor with High Efficiency and Long Lifetime in Poly(Methyl Methacrylate) Through Charge&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Mediated Triplet Exciton Formation for Photolithography Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC) strategy, a new ortho&#8208;linked donor&#8208;acceptor dyad OF&#8208;BCz showing a long lifetime (&#964;P) of 1.92&#8197;s and a high efficiency (&#934;P) up to 30&#8201;% in PMMA matrix, was constructed. Thanks to its excellent performance and high triplet energy level (ET1), OF&#8208;BCz was successfully applied in photolithography as a photoinitiator and an in situ quality indicator.







Abstract
Currently, purely organic compounds showing ambient phosphorescence with high efficiency (&#934;P) and ultra&#8208;long lifetime (&#964;P) are quite rare and often need to be achieved in hydrophilic poly(vinyl alcohol)&#8208;based hosts. This severely limits their applications. Here, we provide a solution to this issue by constructing an ortho&#8208;linked donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) dyad whose D moiety has not only a long&#8208;lived T1 state to achieve a long &#964;P, but also a Tn state that is close to the S1 state of the dyad to trigger effective spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC). The rationality of this strategy was validated by a new phosphor OF&#8208;BCz that is able to show a &#964;P of 1.92&#8197;s and a &#934;P of 30&#8201;% even in a less rigid matrix of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). Excitingly, OF&#8208;BCz exhibited its potential as both a photocuring initiator and an in situ quality indicator, allowing for the visual detection of defects in photolithographic patterning.

         <title>An Aptamer&#8208;Based Nanoflow Cytometry Method for the Molecular Detection and Classification of Ovarian Cancers through Profiling of Tumor Markers on Small Extracellular Vesicles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a simple, rapid and non&#8208;invasive method for the molecular detection and classification of ovarian cancers was developed based on the phenotypic profiling of tumor markers on small extracellular vesicles (sEVs). Accurate detection of ovarian cancer and classification of five ovarian cancer subtypes were achieved by profiling seven cancer&#8208;associated protein markers, including CA125, STIP1, CD24, EpCAM, EGFR, MUC1, and HER2, on sEVs.







Abstract
Molecular profiling of protein markers on small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) is a promising strategy for the precise detection and classification of ovarian cancers. However, this strategy is challenging owing to the lack of simple and practical detection methods. In this work, using an aptamer&#8208;based nanoflow cytometry (nFCM) detection strategy, a simple and rapid method for the molecular profiling of multiple protein markers on sEVs was developed. The protein markers can be easily labeled with aptamer probes and then rapidly profiled by nFCM. Seven cancer&#8208;associated protein markers, including CA125, STIP1, CD24, EpCAM, EGFR, MUC1, and HER2, on plasma sEVs were profiled for the molecular detection and classification of ovarian cancers. Profiling these seven protein markers enabled the precise detection of ovarian cancer with a high accuracy of 94.2&#8201;%. In addition, combined with machine learning algorithms, such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and random forest (RF), the molecular classifications of ovarian cancer cell lines and subtypes were achieved with overall accuracies of 82.9&#8201;% and 55.4&#8201;%, respectively. Therefore, this simple, rapid, and non&#8208;invasive method exhibited considerable potential for the auxiliary diagnosis and molecular classification of ovarian cancers in clinical practice.

         <title>Fluorescent&#8208;Probe Characterization for Pore&#8208;Space Mapping with Single&#8208;Particle Tracking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lithography&#8208;made, two&#8208;dimensional model pore was used to characterize the motion behavior of individual, confined, fluorescent probes under varying pH conditions. The obtained knowledge enabled the pore&#8208;space exploration and mapping of more complex silica materials, such as a real&#8208;life polymerization&#8208;catalyst&#8208;support particle, with sub&#8208;diffraction&#8208;limit resolution.







Abstract
Porous solids often contain complex pore networks with pores of various sizes. Tracking individual fluorescent probes as they diffuse through porous materials can be used to characterize pore networks at tens of nanometers resolution. However, understanding the motion behavior of fluorescent probes in confinement is crucial to reliably derive pore network properties. Here, we introduce well&#8208;defined lithography&#8208;made model pores developed to study probe behavior in confinement. We investigated the influence of probe&#8208;host interactions on diffusion and trapping of confined single&#8208;emitter quantum&#8208;dot probes. Using the pH&#8208;responsiveness of the probes, we were able to largely suppress trapping at the pore walls. This enabled us to define experimental conditions for mapping of the accessible pore space of a one&#8208;dimensional pore array as well as a real&#8208;life polymerization&#8208;catalyst&#8208;support particle.

The obtained knowledge enabled the pore-space exploration and mapping of more complex silica materials, such as a real-life polymerization-catalyst-support particle, with sub-diffraction-limit resolution.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porous solids often contain complex pore networks with pores of various sizes. Tracking individual fluorescent probes as they diffuse through porous materials can be used to characterize pore networks at tens of nanometers resolution. However, understanding the motion behavior of fluorescent probes in confinement is crucial to reliably derive pore network properties. Here, we introduce well-defined lithography-made model pores developed to study probe behavior in confinement. We investigated the influence of probe-host interactions on diffusion and trapping of confined single-emitter quantum-dot probes. Using the pH-responsiveness of the probes, we were able to largely suppress trapping at the pore walls. This enabled us to define experimental conditions for mapping of the accessible pore space of a one-dimensional pore array as well as a real-life polymerization-catalyst-support particle.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polyoxometalate&#8211;Organic Hybrid &#8220;Calixarenes&#8221; as Supramolecular Hosts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid calix[n]arenes (n=3, 4) can be rationally constructed from the coordination&#8208;driven assembly of polyoxometalate building blocks and dicarboxylate linkers with bite angles of 95&#176; and 120&#176;, respectively. With bowl&#8208;shaped, hydrophobic cavities similar to those of organic calixarenes, these molecular containers can host nanometer&#8208;sized Keggin and Dawson anions.







Abstract
Calixarenes are among the most useful and versatile macrocycles in supramolecular chemistry. The one thing that has not changed in the 80&#8197;years since their discovery, despite numerous derivatizations, is their fully organic, covalent scaffolds. Here, we report a new type of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid &#8220;calixarenes&#8221; constructed by means of coordination&#8208;driven assembly. Replacing acetate ligands on the {SiW10Cr2(OAc)2} clusters with 5&#8208;hydroxyisophthalates allows these 95&#176; inorganic building blocks to be linked into bowl&#8208;shaped, hybrid &#8220;calix[n]arenes&#8221; (n=3, 4). With a large concave cavity, the metal&#8211;organic calix[4]arene can accommodate nanometer&#8208;sized polyoxoanions in an entropically driven process. The development of hybrid variants of calixarenes is expected to expand the scope of their physicochemical properties, guest/substrate binding, and applications on multiple fronts.

         <title>Ba12[BN2]6.67H4: A Disordered Anti&#8208;Skutterudite filled with Nitridoborate Anions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel barium nitridoborate hydride was obtained by a solid&#8208;state ampoule reaction and its crystal structure was elucidated by X&#8208;ray and neutron diffraction data. It crystallizes as a filled anti&#8208;skutterudite, featuring nitridoborate and hydride anions inside a barium host lattice. The structure model was further confirmed by magic angle spinning NMR, vibrational spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations.







Abstract
Skutterudites are of high interest in current research due to their diversity of structures comprising empty, partially filled and filled variants, mostly based on metallic compounds. We herein present Ba12[BN2]6.67H4, forming a non&#8208;metallic filled anti&#8208;skutterudite. It is accessed in a solid&#8208;state ampoule reaction from barium subnitride, boron nitride and barium hydride at 750&#8201;&#176;C. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray and neutron powder diffraction data allowed to elucidate the structure in the cubic space group Im
 (no. 204). The barium and hydride atoms form a three&#8208;dimensional network consisting of corner&#8208;sharing HBa6 octahedra and Ba12 icosahedra. Slightly bent [BN2]3&#8722; units are located in the icosahedra and the voids in&#8208;between. 1H and 11B magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR experiments and vibrational spectroscopy further support the structure model. Quantum chemical calculations coincide well with experimental results and provide information about the electronic structure of Ba12[BN2]6.67H4.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free 1,3&#8208;Boronate Rearrangement to Ketones Driven by Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first 1,3&#8208;boronate rearrangement to ketones is reported. The reaction is driven by visible light irradiation, leading to various &#946;&#8208;keto tertiary alcohols under metal&#8208;free conditions. The excited state overcomes the energy barrier for the rearrangement, and mechanistic studies have excluded a free&#8208;radical reaction pathway.







Abstract
Boronate rearrangements, such as the Matteson and Petasis reactions, are valuable metal&#8208;free reactions for the transfer of the carbo group on boron to intramolecular electrophilic sites. However, only highly reactive electrophiles are suitable, and ketones are too inactive for those boronate rearrangements due to the high energy barriers. We disclose here the 1,3&#8208;boronate rearrangement to ketones, for which a high energy barrier (44.9&#8197;kcal/mol) is prohibitory for thermal reactions in the ground state. The reaction is enabled by the key keto&#8208;enol&#8208;boronate bidentate complex formation in situ, which absorbs visible light to reach the excited state for the chemoselective 1,3&#8208;boronate rearrangement to ketones. Experimental and computational investigations exclude free radical intermediates from organoboronates. The aryl, alkenyl, and alkyl boronic acids react with various 1,3&#8208;diketones driven by visible light irradiation to construct structurally diverse &#946;&#8208;keto tertiary alcohols under metal&#8208;free conditions. The reaction demonstrates substrate diversity with 58 examples, yields up to 98&#8201;%, and it is suitable for gram&#8208;scale synthesis.

A hybrid acid/alkali cell was proposed by coupling acidic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with alkaline NaBH4 electrooxidation reaction (BOR), which demonstrated a maximum power density of 20&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and achieved a high current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 during discharging. Additionally, the cell showcased remarkable capabilities for precise and controllable indirect release of H2 stored in NaBH4 at ambient temperature and pressure.







Abstract
Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) has earned recognition as a promising hydrogen carrier, attributed to its exceptional hydrogen storage capacity, boasting a high theoretical storage capacity of 10.8&#8197;wt&#8201;%. Nonetheless, the utilization of traditional pyrolysis and hydrolysis methods still presents a formidable challenge in achieving controlled hydrogen generation especially under ambient conditions. In this work, we report an innovative electrochemical strategy for production H2 by coupling NaBH4 electrooxidation reaction (BOR) at anode in alkaline media with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at cathode in acidic media. To implement this, we have developed a bifunctional electrocatalyst denoted as Pd&#8208;Mo2C@CNTs, wherein Pd nanoparticles are grown in situ on Mo2C embedded within N&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes. This electrocatalyst demonstrates exceptional performance in catalyzing both alkaline BOR and acidic HER. We have developed a hybrid acid/alkali cell, utilizing Pd/Mo2C@CNTs as the anode and cathode electrocatalysts. This configuration showcases remarkable capabilities for self&#8208;sustained, precise, and uninterrupted indirect release of H2 stored in NaBH4, even at high current densities of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a Faraday efficiency approaching 100&#8201;%. Additionally, this electrochemical device exhibits significant promise as a fuel cell, with the ability to deliver a maximum power density of 20&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Unified Synthesis of 2&#8208;Isocyanoallopupukeanane and 9&#8208;Isocyanopupukeanane through a &#8220;Contra&#8208;biosynthetic&#8221; Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantiospecific formal syntheses of 2&#8208;isocyanoallopupukeanane and 9&#8208;isocyanopupukeanane were achieved in 10 and 15 steps, respectively. These short synthetic sequences were enabled by a key palladium&#8208;mediated cyclization cascade and culminated in an unprecedented &#8220;contra&#8208;biosynthetic&#8221; rearrangement, which was investigated computationally and allows access to the related pupukeanane core as a sultone.







Abstract
Herein, we describe our synthetic efforts toward the pupukeanane natural products, in which we have completed the first enantiospecific route to 2&#8208;isocyanoallopupukeanane in 10 steps (formal synthesis), enabled by a key Pd&#8208;mediated cyclization cascade. This subsequently facilitated an unprecedented bio&#8208;inspired &#8220;contra&#8208;biosynthetic&#8221; rearrangement, providing divergent access to 9&#8208;isocyanopupukeanane in 15 steps (formal synthesis). Computational studies provide insight into the nature of this rearrangement.

         <title>Inverse Adsorption Separation of N2O/CO2 in AgZK&#8208;5 Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 4, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a series of silver exchanged zeolite and study the influence of cation types on CO2&#8722;N2O separation. The inverse adsorption of CO2&#8722;N2O was achieved after Ag+ exchanged and the zeolite can preferentially adsorb N2O over CO2, making it capable of trapping N2O from an N2O/CO2 mixture.







Abstract
Nitrous oxide (N2O), as the third largest greenhouse gas in the world, also has great applications in daily life and industrial production, like anesthetic, foaming agent, combustion supporting agent, N or O atomic donor. The capture of N2O in adipic acid tail gas is of great significance but remains challenging due to the similarity with CO2 in molecular size and physical properties. Herein, the influence of cation types on CO2&#8722;N2O separation in zeolite was studied comprehensively. In particular, the inverse adsorption of CO2&#8722;N2O was achieved by AgZK&#8208;5, which preferentially adsorbs N2O over CO2, making it capable of trapping N2O from an N2O/CO2 mixture. AgZK&#8208;5 shows a recorded N2O/CO2 selectivity of 2.2, and the breakthrough experiment indicates excellent performance for N2O/CO2 separation. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation shows that Ag+ has stronger adsorption energy with N2O, and the kinetics of N2O is slightly faster than that of CO2 on AgZK&#8208;5.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Functional Formaldehyde&#8208;Nitrate Batteries for Wastewater Refining, Electricity Generation, and Production of Ammonia and Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As bulky pollutants in industrial and agricultural wastewater, nitrate and formaldehyde pose serious threats to the human health and ecosystem. Current purification technologies including chemical and bio&#8208;/photo&#8208;/electro&#8208;chemical methods, are generally high&#8208;cost, time&#8208;consuming, or energy&#8208;intensive. Here, we report a novel formaldehyde&#8208;nitrate battery by pairing anodic formaldehyde oxidation with cathodic nitrate reduction, which simultaneously enables wastewater purification, electricity generation, and the production of high&#8208;value&#8208;added ammonia and formate. As a result, the formaldehyde&#8208;nitrate battery remarkably exhibits an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.75 V, a peak power density of 3.38 mW cm&#8208;2 and the yield rates of  32.7 mg h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 for ammonia and 889.4 mg h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 for formate. In a large&#8208;scale formaldehyde&#8208;nitrate battery (25 cm2), 99.9% of nitrate and 99.8% of formaldehyde are removed from simulated industrial wastewater and the electricity of 2.03 W&#183;h per day is generated. Moreover, the design of such a multi&#8208;functional battery is universally applicable to the coupling of NO3&#8722; or NO2&#8722; reduction with various aldehyde oxidization, paving a new avenue for wastewater purification and chemical manufacturing.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of 3D&#8208;Printed Heterogeneous Reactor Systems To Overcome Incompatibility Hurdles when Combining Metal and Enzyme Catalysis in a One&#8208;Pot Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Combining chemo&#8208; and biocatalysis enables the design of novel economic and sustainable one&#8208;pot processes to industrial chemicals, preferably proceeding in water. While a range of proof&#8208;of&#8208;concepts for the compatibility of such catalysts from these two different &#8220;worlds of catalysis&#8221; have recently been demonstrated, merging non&#8208;compatible chemo&#8208; and biocatalysts for joint applications within one reactor remained a challenge. A conceptual solution is compartmentalization of the catalytic moieties by heterogenization of critical catalyst components, thus &#8220;shielding&#8221; them from the complementary non&#8208;compatible catalyst, substrate or reagent. Exemplified for a one&#8208;pot process consisting of a metal&#8208;catalyzed Wacker oxidation and enzymatic reduction as non&#8208;compatible individual reactions steps, we demonstrate that making use of 3D&#8208;printing of heterogeneous materials containing Cu as critical metal component can overcome such incompatibility hurdles. The application of a 3D&#8208;printed Cu&#8208;ceramic device as metal catalyst component allows an efficient combination with the enzyme and the desired two&#8208;step transformation of styrene into the chiral alcohol product with high overall conversion and excellent enantioselectivity. This compartmentalization concept based on 3D&#8208;printing of heterogenized metal catalysts represents a scalable methodology and opens up numerous perspectives to be used as a general tool also for other related chemoenzymatic research challenges.</dc:description>

         <title>LiNO3&#8208;Based Electrolytes via Electron&#8208;Donation Modulation for Sustainable Nonaqueous Lithium Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>LiPF6 as a dominant lithium salt of electrolyte is widely used in commercial rechargeable lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to its well&#8208;balanced properties, including high solubility in organic solvents, good electrochemical stability, and high ionic conductivity. However, it suffers from several undesirable properties, such as high moisture sensitivity, thermal instability, and high cost. To address these issues, herein, we propose an electron&#8208;donation modulation (EDM) rule for the development of low&#8208;cost, sustainable, and electrochemically compatible LiNO3&#8208;based electrolytes. We employ high donor&#8208;number solvents (HDNSs) with strong electron&#8208;donation ability to dissolve LiNO3, while low donor&#8208;number solvents (LDNSs) with weak electron&#8208;donation ability are used to regulate the solvation structure to stabilize the electrolytes. As an example, we design the LiNO3&#8208;DMSO@PC electrolyte, where DMSO acts as an HDNS and PC serves as an LDNS. This electrolyte exhibits excellent electrochemical compatibility with graphite anodes, as well as the LiFePO4 and LiCoO2 cathodes, leading to stable cycling over 200 cycles. Through spectroscopy analyses and theoretical calculation, we uncover the underlying mechanism responsible for the stabilization of these electrolytes. Our findings provide valuable insights into the preparation of LiNO3&#8208;based electrolytes using the EDM rule, opening new avenues for the development of advanced electrolytes with versatile functions for sustainable rechargeable batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective&#160;Synthesis of Complex Polyenes through Sequential &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H Functionalization of trans&#8208;Styrenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sequential C&#8722;H functionalization of molecules containing multiple C&#8722;H bonds can efficiently lead to structural diversity. Herein we present the first chelation&#8208;assisted sequential &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization of E&#8208;styrenes with simple alkenes and alkynes in excellent regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivity. The process involves &#945; C&#8722;H functionalization by six&#8208;membered exo&#8208;cyclopalladation to result in tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted 1,3&#8208;dienes and &#946; C&#8722;H functionalization through seven&#8208;membered endo&#8208;cyclopalladation to produce tetra&#8208; and pentasubstituted 1,3,5&#8208;trienes in up to 97% yield with up to &gt; 99/1 E/Z selectivity, both enabled by the chelation assistance of pyrazinamide. The protocol is demonstrated to be widely applicable, tolerant to a wide range of functional groups and bioactive fragments, and suitable for gram&#8208;scale synthesis as well as one&#8208;pot and two step preparation of trienes. Mechanistic experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to elucidate the selectivity and reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Modifying the Oxidative Potentials of Imines in a Dye Loaded Capsule for Photocatalytic Cyclization with Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modifying redox potential of substrates and intermediates to balance pairs of redox steps are important stages for multistep photosynthesis but faced marked challenges. Through co&#8208;clathration of iridium photosensitizer and imine substrate within one packet of a metal&#8208;organic capsule to shift the redox potentials of substrate, herein, we reported a multiphoton enzymatic strategy for the generation of heterocycles by intramolecular C&#8208;X hydrogen evolution cross&#8208;couplings. The cage facilitated a pre&#8208;equilibrium substrate&#8208;involving clathrate that cathodic shifts the oxidation potential of the substrate&#8208;dye&#8208;host ternary complex and configuration inversion of substrate via spatial constraints in the confined space. The new two photon excitation strategy enabled the precise control of the multistep electron transfer between each pair (photosensitizer, substrate and the capsule), endowing the catalytic system proceeding smoothly with an enzymatic fashion. Three kinds of 2&#8208;subsituted (&#8208;OH, &#8208;NH2, and &#8208;SH) imines and N&#8208;aryl enamines all give the corresponding cyclization products efficiently under visible light irradiation, demonstrating the promising of the microenvironment driven thermodynamic activation in the host&#8208;dye&#8208;substrate ternary for synergistic combination of multistep photocatalytic transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>BN&#8208;Isosteres of Nonacene with Antiaromatic B2C4 and N2C4 Heterocycles: Synthesis and Strong Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Embedding both boron and nitrogen into the backbone of acenes to generate their isoelectronic structures has significantly enriched the acene chemistry to offer appealing properties. However, only small BN&#8208;heteroacenes have been extensively investigated, with BN&#8208;heptacenes as the hitherto longest homologue. Herein, we report the synthesis of three new nonacene BN&#8208;isosteres via incorporating antiaromatic B2C4 and N2C4 heterocycles, representing a new length record for BN&#8208;heteroacenes. The distance between the B2C4 and N2C4 rings affects the contribution of the charge&#8208;separated resonance forms, leading to tunable antiaromaticity of the two heterocycles. The adjusted local antiaromaticity manifests substantial influence on the molecular orbital arrangement, and consequently, the radiative transition rate of BN&#8208;3 is greatly enhanced compared with BN&#8208;1 and BN&#8208;2, realizing a high fluorescence quantum yield of 92%. This work provides a novel design concept of large acene BN&#8208;isosteres and reveals the importance of BN/CC isosterism on their luminescent properties.</dc:description>

         <title>HClO&#8208;Mediated Photoelectrochemical Epoxidation of Alkenes with Near 100% Conversion Rate and Selectivity by Regulating Lattice Chlorine Cycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Directional organic transformation via a green, sustainable catalytic reaction has attracted a lot of attention. Herein, we report a photoelectrochemical approach for highly selective epoxidation of alkenes in a salt solution using Co2(OH)3Cl (CoOCl) as a bridge of photo&#8208;generated charge, where the lattice Cl of CoOCl can be oxidized to generate HClO by the photo&#8208;generated holes of BiVO4 photoanode and being spontaneously recovered by Cl of salt solution, which then oxidizes the alkenes into the corresponding epoxides. As a result, a series of water&#8208;soluble alkenes, including 4&#8208;vinylbenzenesulfonic acid sodium, 2&#8208;Methyl&#8208;2&#8208;propene&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonic acid sodium, and 3&#8208;Methyl&#8208;3&#8208;buten&#8208;1&#8208;ol can be epoxidized with near 100% conversion rate and selectivity. Through further inserting a MoOx protection layer between BiVO4 and CoOCl, the stability of CoOCl&#8208;MoOx/BiVO4 can be maintained for at least 120 hours. This work opens an avenue for solar&#8208;driven organic epoxidation with a possibility of on&#8208;site reaction around the abundant ocean.</dc:description>

         <title>&#8220;Turbo&#8208;Charged&#8221; DNA Motors with Optimized Sequence Enable Single&#8208;Molecule Nucleic Acid Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA motors that consume chemical energy to generate processive mechanical motion mimic natural motor proteins and have garnered interest due to their potential applications in dynamic nanotechnology, biosensing, and drug delivery. Such motors translocate by a catalytic cycle of binding, cleavage, and rebinding between DNA &#8220;legs&#8221; on the motor body and RNA &#8220;footholds&#8221; on a track. Herein, we address the well&#8208;documented trade&#8208;off between motor speed and processivity and investigate how these parameters are controlled by the affinity between DNA legs and their complementary footholds. Specifically, we explore the role of DNA leg length and GC content in tuning motor performance by dictating the rate of leg&#8208;foothold dissociation. Our investigations reveal that motors with 0% GC content exhibit increased instantaneous velocities of up to 150 nm/sec, three&#8208;fold greater than previously reported DNA motors and comparable to the speeds of biological motor proteins. We also demonstrate that the faster speed and weaker forces generated by 0% GC motors can be leveraged for enhanced capabilities in sensing. We observe single&#8208;molecule sensitivity when programming the motor to stall in response to the binding of nucleic acid targets. These findings offer insights for the design of high&#8208;performance DNA motors with promising real&#8208;world biosensing applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Flexible Synthesis of Polypropionates via Diastereodivergent Reductive Ring&#8208;Opening of Trisubstituted Secondary Glycidols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our novel approach towards polypropionate synthesis features stereochemically uniform trisubstituted sec&#8208;glycidols as branching points for the highly selective synthesis of all isomers of polypropionate building blocks. The key&#8208;step of diversification is accomplished by mechanism&#8208;control of the diastereodivergent reductive opening at the epoxide's tertiary C&#8208;atom that occurs with excellent control of regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity.







Abstract
Polypropionates, characterized by their alternating sequence of stereocenters bearing methyl&#8208; and hydroxy&#8208;groups, are structurally diverse natural products of utmost importance.[1] Herein, we introduce a novel concept approach towards polypropionate synthesis featuring a diastereodivergent reductive epoxide&#8208;opening as a key step. Readily available and stereochemically uniform trisubstituted sec&#8208;glycidols serve as branching points for the highly selective synthesis of all isomers of polypropionate building blocks with three or more consecutive stereocenters. Stereodiversification is accomplished by an unprecedented mechanism&#8208;control over the stereochemically complementary modification of the epoxide's tertiary C&#8208;atom with excellent control of regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. Since our method is not only suited for the preparation of specific targets but also for compound libraries, it will have a great impact on polypropionate synthesis.

         <title>Ultrafast Surface&#8208;Specific Spectroscopy of Water at a Photoexcited TiO2 Model Water&#8208;Splitting Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
After UV excitation electrons and holes are generated at a timescale faster than 300&#8197;fs. The holes located at the surface subsequently mediate the deprotonation of interfacial water into Ti&#8722;OH species and of pre&#8208;existing Ti&#8722;OH groups. At both pH&#8197;3 and 11 this reaction occurs in less than 20&#8197;ps.







Abstract
A critical step in photocatalytic water dissociation is the hole&#8208;mediated oxidation reaction. Molecular&#8208;level insights into the mechanism of this complex reaction under realistic conditions with high temporal resolution are highly desirable. Here, we use femtosecond time&#8208;resolved, surface&#8208;specific vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopy to study the photo&#8208;induced reaction directly at the interface of the photocatalyst TiO2 in contact with liquid water at room temperature. Thanks to the inherent surface specificity of the spectroscopic method, we can follow the reaction of solely the interfacial water molecules directly at the interface at timescales on which the reaction takes place. Following the generation of holes at the surface immediately after photoexcitation of the catalyst with UV light, water dissociation occurs on a sub&#8208;20&#8197;ps timescale. The reaction mechanism is similar at pH&#8197;3 and 11. In both cases, we observe the conversion of H2O into Ti&#8722;OH groups and the deprotonation of pre&#8208;existing Ti&#8722;OH groups. This study provides unique experimental insights into the early steps of the photo&#8208;induced dissociation processes at the photocatalyst&#8208;water interface, relevant to the design of improved photocatalysts.

         <title>Self&#8208;reporting and Biodegradable Thermosetting Solid Polymer Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the significant effort to improve the performance of solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs), direct monitoring of physical and chemical changes as well as the sustainability in SPEs is still lacking. Here, we report a self&#8208;reporting and biodegradable thermosetting SPE via well&#8208;designed structure to analyze the performance mechanism behind SPEs and promote the development of friendly environment.







Abstract
To date, significant efforts have been dedicated to improve their ionic conductivity, thermal stability, and mechanical strength of solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs). However, direct monitoring of physical and chemical changes in SPEs is still lacking. Moreover, existing thermosetting SPEs are hardly degradable. Herein, by overcoming the limitation predicted by Flory theory, self&#8208;reporting and biodegradable thermosetting hyperbranched poly(&#946;&#8208;amino ester)&#8208;based SPEs (HPAE&#8208;SPEs) are reported. HPAE is successfully synthesized through a well&#8208;controlled &#8220;A2+B4&#8221; Michael addition strategy and then crosslinked it in situ to produce HPAE&#8208;SPEs. The multiple tertiary aliphatic amines at the branching sites confer multicolour luminescence to HPAE&#8208;SPEs, enabling direct observation of its physical and chemical damage. After use, HPAE&#8208;SPEs can be rapidly hydrolysed into non&#8208;hazardous &#946;&#8208;amino acids and polyols via self&#8208;catalysis. Optimized HPAE&#8208;SPE exhibits an ionic conductivity of 1.3&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S/cm at 60&#8201;&#176;C, a Na+ transference number (
) of 0.67, a highly stable sodium plating&#8208;stripping behaviour and a low overpotential of &#8776;190&#8197;mV. This study establishes a new paradigm for developing SPEs by engineering multifunctional polymers. The self&#8208;reporting and biodegradable properties would greatly expand the scope of applications for SPEs.

An atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical and redox&#8208;neutral cascade reaction enabled by dual&#8208;metal relay catalysis by merging borrowing&#8208;hydrogen and Michael addition reactions provided access to all stereoisomers of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxyvaleric acid derivatives with 1,4&#8208;non&#8208;adjacent stereocenters. Concise stereodivergent synthesis of key intermediates for the synthesis of biologically important chiral molecules further showcases the synthetic utility of the approach.







Abstract
An atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical and redox&#8208;neutral cascade reaction enabled by asymmetric bimetallic relay catalysis by merging a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric borrowing&#8208;hydrogen reaction with copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Michael addition has been realized. A variety of highly functionalized 2&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxyvaleric acid esters or peptides bearing 1,4&#8208;non&#8208;adjacent stereogenic centers have been prepared in high yields with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. Judicious selection and rational modification of the Ru catalysts with careful tuning of the reaction conditions played a pivotal role in stereoselectivity control as well as attenuating undesired &#945;&#8208;epimerization, thus enabling a full complement of all four stereoisomers that were otherwise inaccessible in previous work. Concise asymmetric stereodivergent synthesis of the key intermediates for biologically important chiral molecules further showcases the synthetic utility of this methodology.

         <title>Volatile Perovskite Precursor Ink Enables Window Printing of Phase&#8208;Pure FAPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules in Ambient Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, a stable volatile precursor ink has been developed, enabling the wide speed window (0.3&#8197;m/min to 18.0&#8197;m/min) printing of phase&#8208;pure FAPbI3 perovskite film in an ambient atmosphere. Ultimately, small&#8208;area FAPbI3 pero&#8208;SCs (0.062&#8197;cm2) and large&#8208;area modules (15.64&#8197;cm2) achieved remarkable efficiencies of 24.32&#8201;% and 21.90&#8201;%, along with superior operational stability with T90&gt;1350&#8197;h.







Abstract
Despite the great success of perovskite photovoltaics in terms of device efficiency and stability using laboratory&#8208;scale spin&#8208;coating methods, the demand for high&#8208;throughput and cost&#8208;effective solutions remains unresolved and rarely reported because of the complicated nature of perovskite crystallization. In this work, we propose a stable precursor ink design strategy to control the solvent volatilization and perovskite crystallization to enable the wide speed window printing (0.3 to 18.0&#8197;m/min) of phase&#8208;pure FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) in ambient atmosphere. The FAPbI3 perovskite precursor ink uses volatile acetonitrile (ACN) as the main solvent with DMF and DMSO as coordination additives is beneficial to improve the ink stability, inhibit the coffee rings, and the complicated intermediate FAPbI3 phases, delivering high&#8208;quality pin&#8208;hole free and phase&#8208;pure FAPbI3 perovskite films with large&#8208;scale uniformity. Ultimately, small&#8208;area FAPbI3 pero&#8208;SCs (0.062&#8197;cm2) and large&#8208;area modules (15.64&#8197;cm2) achieved remarkable efficiencies of 24.32&#8201;% and 21.90&#8201;%, respectively, whereas the PCE of the devices can be maintained at 23.76&#8201;% when the printing speed increases to 18.0&#8197;m/min. Specifically, the unencapsulated device exhibits superior operational stability with T90&gt;1350&#8197;h. This work represents a step towards the scalable, cost&#8208;effective manufacturing of perovskite photovoltaics with both high performance and high throughput.

         <title>Cross&#8208;domain Chirality Transfer in Self&#8208;Assembly of Chiral Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The compatibility of mid&#8208;block and chiral block is critical to the cross&#8208;domain chirality transfer in ABC*&#8208;type chiral triblock terpolymers. When the mid&#8208;block is compatible with the chiral block, chirality could transfer through the mid&#8208;domains with limited thickness. In contrast, as the mid&#8208;block is incompatible with the chiral block, chiral interactions will be restricted, independent with the length of mid&#8208;block.







Abstract
Chirality transfer is essential to acquire helical hierarchical superstructures from the self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular materials. By taking advantage of chirality transfers at different length scales through intra&#8208;chain and inter&#8208;chain chiral interactions, helical phase (H*) can be formed from the self&#8208;assembly of chiral block copolymers (BCPs*). In this study, chiral triblock terpolymers, polystyrene&#8208;b&#8208;poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(L&#8208;lactide) (PS&#8208;PEO&#8208;PLLA), and polystyrene&#8208;b&#8208;poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(L&#8208;lactide) (PS&#8208;P4VP&#8208;PLLA) are synthesized for self&#8208;assembly. For PS&#8208;PEO&#8208;PLLA with an achiral PEO mid&#8208;block that is compatible with PLLA (chiral end&#8208;block), H* can be formed while the block length is below a critical value. By contrast, for the one with achiral P4VP mid&#8208;block that is incompatible with PLLA, the formation of H* phase would be suppressed regardless of the length of the mid&#8208;block, giving cylinder phase. Those results elucidate a new type of chirality transfer across the phase domain that is referred as cross&#8208;domain chirality transfer, providing complementary understanding of the chirality transfer at the interface of phase&#8208;separated domains.

         <title>Degradable Block Copolymer Nanoparticles Synthesized by Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarizes developments in degradable block copolymer nanoparticles, including shell&#8208;degradable, core&#8208;degradable and all&#8208;degradable nanoparticles, synthesized by polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA). The high production efficiency of PISA coupled with degradability provides the next generation of particulate materials that can better serve the need for sustainability.







Abstract
Polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) combines polymerization and in situ self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers in one system and has become a widely used method to prepare block copolymer nanoparticles at high concentrations. The persistence of polymers in the environment poses a huge threat to the ecosystem and represents a significant waste of resources. There is an urgent need to develop novel chemical approaches to synthesize degradable polymers. To meet with this demand, it is crucial to install degradability into PISA nanoparticles. Most recently, degradable PISA nanoparticles have been synthesized by introducing degradation mechanisms into either shell&#8208;forming or core&#8208;forming blocks. This Minireview summarizes the development in degradable block copolymer nanoparticles synthesized by PISA, including shell&#8208;degradable, core&#8208;degradable, and all&#8208;degradable nanoparticles. Future development will benefit from expansion of polymerization techniques with new degradation mechanisms and adaptation of high&#8208;throughput approaches for both PISA syntheses and degradation studies.

         <title>Catalytic Protein Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic inhibitors (CIs) mediate some type of post&#8208;translational modification that inactivates the target protein. This can provide a substantial increase in potency relative to occupancy&#8208;driven inhibitors. This article reviews the development of this field, current applications in targeted protein degradation, and design considerations for non&#8208;degradative CIs.







Abstract
Many of the highest priority targets in a wide range of disease states are difficult&#8208;to&#8208;drug proteins. The development of reversible small molecule inhibitors for the active sites of these proteins with sufficient affinity and residence time on&#8208;target is an enormous challenge. This has engendered interest in strategies to increase the potency of a given protein inhibitor by routes other than further improvement in gross affinity. Amongst these, the development of catalytic protein inhibitors has garnered the most attention and investment, particularly with respect to protein degraders, which catalyze the destruction of the target protein. This article discusses the genesis of the burgeoning field of catalytic inhibitors, the current state of the art, and exciting future directions.

Amongst these, the development of catalytic protein inhibitors has garnered the most attention and investment, particularly with respect to protein degraders, which catalyze the destruction of the target protein. This article discusses the genesis of the burgeoning field of catalytic inhibitors, the current state of the art, and exciting future directions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Isonitriles as Alkyl Radical Precursors in Visible Light Mediated Hydro&#8208; and Deuterodeamination Reactions
</title>

         <dc:description>
We report the use of isonitriles as alkyl radical precursors in visible&#8208;light mediated hydro&#8208; and deuterodeamination reactions. Most examples only require visible&#8208;light irradiation of the isonitrile in the presence of a silyl radical precursor, although a significant acceleration was observed in the presence of an organic photocatalyst. The method is scalable, shows broad functional group compatibility and is general for C&#945;&#8208;primary, C&#945;&#8208;secondary and C&#945;&#8208;tertiary alkyl isonitriles.







Abstract
Herein, we report the use of isonitriles as alkyl radical precursors in light&#8208;mediated hydro&#8208; and deuterodeamination reactions. The reaction is scalable, shows broad functional group compatibility and potential to be used in late&#8208;stage functionalization. Importantly, the method is general for C&#945;&#8208;primary, C&#945;&#8208;secondary and C&#945;&#8208;tertiary alkyl isonitriles. For most examples, high yields were obtained through direct visible&#8208;light irradiation of the isonitrile in the presence of a silyl radical precursor. Interestingly, in the presence of an organic photocatalyst (4CzIPN) a dramatic acceleration was observed. In&#8208;depth mechanistic studies using UV/Vis absorption, steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence, and transient absorption spectroscopy suggest that the excited state of 4CzIPN can engage in a single&#8208;electron transfer with the isonitrile.

         <title>Atomically Precise Silver Clusters Stabilized by Lacunary Polyoxometalates with Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two atomically precise Ag clusters stabilized by lacunary polyoxometalates have been successfully synthesized using a facile one&#8208;pot solvothermal approach, the resulting POM&#8208;stabilized Ag clusters have been pioneeringly investigated as catalysts for photocatalytic CO2 reduction to HCOOH with a high selectivity.







Abstract
The syntheses of atomically precise silver (Ag) clusters stabilized by multidentate lacunary polyoxometalate (POM) ligands have been emerging as a promising but challenging research direction, the combination of redox&#8208;active POM ligands and silver clusters will render them unexpected geometric structures and catalytic properties. Herein, we report the successful construction of two structurally&#8208;new lacunary POM&#8208;stabilized Ag clusters, TBA6H14Ag14(DPPB)4(CH3CN)9[Ag24(Si2W18O66)3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10CH3CN&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;9H2O ({Ag24(Si2W18O66)3}, TBA=tetra&#8208;n&#8208;butylammonium, DPPB=1,4&#8208;Bis(diphenylphosphino)butane) and TBA14H6Ag9Na2(H2O)9[Ag27(Si2W18O66)3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;8CH3CN&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10H2O ({Ag27(Si2W18O66)3}), using a facile one&#8208;pot solvothermal approach. Under otherwise identical synthetic conditions, the molecular structures of two POM&#8208;stabilized Ag clusters could be readily tuned by the addition of different organic ligands. In both compounds, the central trefoil&#8208;propeller&#8208;shaped {Ag24}14+ and {Ag27}17+ clusters bearing 10 delocalized valence electrons are stabilized by three C&#8208;shaped {Si2W18O66} units. The femtosecond/nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy revealed the rapid charge transfer between {Ag24}14+ core and {Si2W18O66} ligands. Both compounds have been pioneeringly investigated as catalysts for photocatalytic CO2 reduction to HCOOH with a high selectivity.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Trifluoromethoxylation of Silyl Enol Ethers and Allyl Silanes with Bis(trifluoromethyl)peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalyst&#8208;free trifluoromethoxylation methods of alkenyl substrates under mild conditions have been developed using bis(trifluoromethyl)peroxide (BTMP) as a practical and relatively atom&#8208;economical reagent. Silyl enol ether substrates react to form either &#945;&#8208;(trifluoromethoxy)ketones or OCF3&#8208;containing silyl enol ethers depending on the solvent used while allyl silanes afford unprecedented allyl(trifluoromethyl)ethers.







Abstract
Radical trifluoromethoxylation is an attractive approach to prepare compounds featuring the important OCF3 group, however most existing methods have focused on aromatic substrates. Here, we report novel methodologies with alkenyl substrates employing bis(trifluoromethyl)peroxide (BTMP) as a practical and comparatively atom economical trifluoromethoxylating reagent. With silyl enol ether substrates, switching reaction solvent allows for the synthesis of either &#945;&#8208;(trifluoromethoxy)ketone products or unprecedented alkenyl&#8208;OCF3 species. Furthermore, allyl silanes have been employed as substrates for the first time, affording allyl(trifluoromethyl)ether products in good yields. In each case, the methods operate at room temperature without large excesses of the alkene substrate while, in contrast to previous radical trifluoromethoxylation reactions, no catalyst, light or other activators are required.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Aza&#8208;Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi (NHK) Reaction of &#945;&#8208;Imino Esters with Alkenyl Halides</title>

         <dc:description>
The cobalt&#8208;catalyzed aza&#8208;NHK (Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi) reaction of ketimine has been realized to access diverse &#945;&#8208;tertiary vinylic amino esters with excellent enantioselectivity and broad functional group tolerance. Notably, both configuration of alkenyl halide provides the same stereochemical outcome of chiral &#945;&#8208;alkenyl quaternary amino ester, indicating that isomerization of alkenyl fragment might be involved in the catalytic cycle.







Abstract
Chromium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi (NHK) reaction represents one of the most powerful approaches for the formation of chiral carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond. However, the construction of sterically encumbered tetrasubstituted stereocenter through NHK reaction still posts a significant challenge. Herein, we disclose a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed aza&#8208;NHK reaction of ketimine with alkenyl halide to provide a convenient synthetic approach for the manufacture of enantioenriched tetrasubstituted &#945;&#8208;vinylic amino acid. This protocol exhibits excellent functional group tolerance with excellent 99&#8201;% ee in most cases. Additionally, this asymmetric reductive method is also applicable to the aldimine to access the trisubstituted stereogenic centers.

         <title>Dynamic in situ Formation of Cu2O Sub&#8208;Nanoclusters through Photoinduced pseudo&#8208;Fehling's Reaction for Selective and Efficient Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Photosynthesis</title>

The dynamic Cu2O nanoclusters are operando constructed by a photoinduced pseudo&#8208;Fehling&#8208;reaction, which work as the true active sites for sustainable nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia photosynthesis.







Abstract
Copper (Cu) is evidenced to be effective for constructing advanced catalysts. In particular, Cu2O is identified to be active for general catalytic reactions. However, conflicting results regarding the true structure&#8208;activity correlations between Cu2O&#8208;based active sites and efficiencies are usually reported. The structure of Cu2O undergoes dynamic evolution rather than remaining stable under working conditions, in which the actual reaction cannot proceed over the prefabricated Cu2O sites. Therefore, the dynamic construction of Cu2O active sites can be developed to promote catalytic efficiency and reveal the true structure&#8208;activity correlations. Herein, by introducing the redox pairs of Cu2+ and reducing sugar into a photocatalysis system, it is clarified that the Cu2O sub&#8208;nanoclusters (NCs), working as novel active sites, are on&#8208;site constructed on the substrate via a photoinduced pseudo&#8208;Fehling's route. The realistic interfacial charge separation and transformation capacities are remarkably promoted by the dynamic Cu2O NCs under the actual catalysis condition, which achieves a milestone efficiency for nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia photosynthesis, including the targets of production rate (1.98&#177;0.04&#8197;mol&#8201;gCu&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), conversion ratio (94.2&#177;0.91&#8201;%), and selectivity (98.6&#8201;%&#177;0.55&#8201;%). The current work develops an effective strategy for integrating the active site construction into realistic reactions, providing new opportunities for Cu&#8208;based chemistry and catalysis sciences research.

         <title>Polyurethane with &#946;&#8208;Selenocarbonyl Structure Enabling the Combination of Plastic Degradation and Waste Upcycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selenium&#8208;containing polyurethane materials are degraded into selenium fertilizers for selenium&#8208;rich plant cultivation and further improvement of selenium&#8208;deficiency within humans via selenoxide elimination reaction, achieving both the degradation and upcycling of plastic waste, offering a more sustainable plastic economy.







Abstract
Degradable polymers offer a promising solution to mitigate global plastic pollution, but the degraded products often suffer from diminished value. Upcycling is a more sustainable approach to upgrade polymer waste into value&#8208;added products. Herein, we report a &#946;&#8208;selenocarbonyl&#8208;containing polyurethane (SePU), which can be directly degraded under mild conditions into valuable selenium fertilizers for selenium&#8208;rich vegetable cultivation globally, enabling both plastic degradation and waste upcycling. Under oxidation condition, this polymer can be easily and selectively degraded via selenoxide elimination reaction from mixed plastic waste. The degraded product can serve as effective selenium fertilizers to increase selenium content in radish and pak choi. The SePU exhibits excellent mechanical properties. Additionally, we observed the formation of spherulites&#8208;like selenium particles within the materials during degradation for the first time. Our research offers a successful application of selenoxide elimination reaction in the field of plastic degradation for the first time, endowing plastics with both degradability and high reusable value. This strategy provides a promising solution to reduce pollution and improve economy and sustainability of plastics.

         <title>Precise Regulation of Multiple Resonance Distribution Regions of a B,N&#8208;Embedded Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon to Customize Its BT2020 Green Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrapure green emitter was successfully prepared by precisely regulating multiple resonance (MR) distribution regions. The optimized top&#8208;emitting organic light&#8208;emitting diode simultaneously achieved a record&#8208;high current efficiency of 226.4 cd A&#8208;1, an ultra&#8208;narrow full width at half maximum of 16&#8197;nm, a nearly BT2020 green color (CIE: 0.14, 0.79), and long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
Recently, boron (B)/nitrogen (N)&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), characterized by multiple resonances (MR), have attracted significant attention owing to their remarkable features of efficient narrowband emissions with small full width at half maxima (FWHMs). However, developing ultra&#8208;narrowband pure&#8208;green emitters that comply with the Broadcast Service Television 2020 (BT2020) standard remains challenging. Precise regulation of the MR distribution regions allows simultaneously achieving the emission maximum, FWHM value, and spectral shape that satisfy the BT2020 standard. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept molecule TPABO&#8208;DICz exhibited ultrapure green emission with a dominant peak at 515&#8197;nm, an extremely small FWHM of 17&#8197;nm, and Commission Internationale de l&#8242;Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.17, 0.76). The corresponding bottom&#8208;emitting organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) exhibited a remarkably high CIEy value (0.74) and maximum external quantum efficiency (25.8&#8201;%). Notably, the top&#8208;emitting OLED achieved nearly BT2020 green color (CIE: 0.14, 0.79) and exhibited a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art maximum current efficiency of 226.4 cd A&#8722;1, thus fully confirming the effectiveness of the above strategy.

         <title>Identification of Crucial Photosensitizing Factors to Promote CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of Ir(III)&#8208;based photosensitizers (PSs) were prepared as a molecular platform to identify the crucial factors to maximize the photochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. The dinuclear PS Ir&#8208;6 was over 54&#8197;times better than typical PS Ir&#8208;1 with a turnover number of up to 28160 under optimal conditions. Detailed investigations revealed that the incremental strong&#8208;visible&#8208;light absorption capacity by molecular structure&#8208;tuning is a crucial factor to boost CO2 photoreduction.







Abstract
The sensitizing ability of a catalytic system is closely related to the visible&#8208;light absorption ability, excited&#8208;state lifetime, redox potential, and electron&#8208;transfer rate of photosensitizers (PSs), however it remains a great challenge to concurrently mediate these factors to boost CO2 photoreduction. Herein, a series of Ir(III)&#8208;based PSs (Ir&#8208;1&#8211;Ir&#8208;6) were prepared as molecular platforms to understand the interplay of these factors and identify the primary factors for efficient CO2 photoreduction. Among them, less efficient visible&#8208;light absorption capacity results in lower CO yields of Ir&#8208;1, Ir&#8208;2 or Ir&#8208;4. Ir&#8208;3 shows the most efficient photocatalytic activity among these mononuclear PSs due to some comprehensive parameters. Although the Kobs of Ir&#8208;3 is &#8776;10&#8197;times higher than that of Ir&#8208;5, the CO yield of Ir&#8208;3 is slightly higher than that of Ir&#8208;5 due to the compensation of Ir&#8208;5&#8217;s strong visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing ability. Ir&#8208;6 exhibits excellent photocatalytic performance due to the strong visible&#8208;light absorption ability, comparable thermodynamic driving force, and electron transfer rate among these PSs. Remarkably, the CO2 photoreduction to CO with Ir&#8208;6 can achieve 91.5&#8197;&#956;mol, over 54&#8197;times higher than Ir&#8208;1, and the optimized TONC&#8208;1 can reach up to 28160. Various photophysical properties of the PSs were concurrently adjusted by fine ligand modification to promote CO2 photoreduction.

Electrocatalysts with atomically dispersed metal sites (e.g., metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon) have been deemed as promising alternatives for noble&#8208;metal catalysts in couples of electrocatalytic reactions. However, the modulation of such atomic sites and the understanding of their interactions are still highly challenging. Herein, we propose a unique supermolecule assembly&#8208;profile coating strategy to prepare a series of diatomic electrocatalysts by profile coating of eight Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) on supramolecular supports respectively as bimetallic sources. The detailed microstructure analysis revealed that the metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon sites with four&#8208; (Zn&#8722;N4) and five&#8208;coordination (Fe&#8722;N5) via the nitrogen coordination are similar to the cytochrome c oxidases. For promising electrocatalysis, such unique microstructure is able to activate oxygen molecules due to nitrogen&#8208;bonding coordination with bimetal sites, thus leading to efficient four&#8208;electron oxygen reduction in alkaline, neutral, and acid electrolytes. Especially, zinc group elements (e.g., Zn and Cd) with d10 electron configuration would significantly boost the nitrogen&#8208;bonding coordination with bimetal sites to enhance electrocatalytic activity. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for the general synthesis of advanced electrocatalysts with controllable bimetal active sites and the mechanistic understanding will promote the promising electrocatalysis by applying the similar principles.

&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalysts with atomically dispersed metal sites (e.g., metal-nitrogen-carbon) have been deemed as promising alternatives for noble-metal catalysts in couples of electrocatalytic reactions. However, the modulation of such atomic sites and the understanding of their interactions are still highly challenging. Herein, we propose a unique supermolecule assembly-profile coating strategy to prepare a series of diatomic electrocatalysts by profile coating of eight Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) on supramolecular supports respectively as bimetallic sources. The detailed microstructure analysis revealed that the metal-nitrogen-carbon sites with four- (Zn&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and five-coordination (Fe&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) via the nitrogen coordination are similar to the cytochrome c oxidases. For promising electrocatalysis, such unique microstructure is able to activate oxygen molecules due to nitrogen-bonding coordination with bimetal sites, thus leading to efficient four-electron oxygen reduction in alkaline, neutral, and acid electrolytes. Especially, zinc group elements (e.g., Zn and Cd) with d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; electron configuration would significantly boost the nitrogen-bonding coordination with bimetal sites to enhance electrocatalytic activity. The proof-of-concept for the general synthesis of advanced electrocatalysts with controllable bimetal active sites and the mechanistic understanding will promote the promising electrocatalysis by applying the similar principles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Tolerant Near&#8208;Infrared Organic Long&#8208;Persistent Luminescent Copolymers
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymers exhibiting near&#8208;infrared (NIR) long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) consisting of a carbazole donor and a small amount of ionic acceptor have been realized. The polymer exhibits LPL without dopants and has higher phase stability than small molecule mixtures. The LPL can be observed even in air and at high temperatures&#160;below the glass transition temperature.







Abstract
Organic materials exhibiting long&#8208;lasting emission in the near infrared are expected to have applications in bio&#8208;imaging and other areas. Although room temperature phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence display long&#8208;lived emission of approximately one minute, organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence (OLPL) systems with a similar emission mechanism to inorganic persistent emitters can emit for several hours at room temperature. In particular OLPL with a hole&#8208;diffusion mechanism can function even in the presence of oxygen. However, ionic materials lack long&#8208;term stability in neutral organic host owing to aggregation and phase separation. In this study, we synthesized polymers with stable near&#8208;infrared persistent luminescence at room temperature via the copolymerization of electron donors and acceptors. The copolymers exhibit long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) at temperatures below the glass transition temperature and can be excited by approximately the entire range of visible light. LPL properties and spectra can be controlled by the dopant.

         <title>Designing and Engineering Atomically Dispersed Metal Catalysts for CO2 to CO Conversion: From Single to Dual Metal Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Progress, challenges, and opportunities for designing and engineering atomic metal catalysts are discussed from single to dual metal sites for CO2 to CO conversion. In particular, designing optimal dual metal site catalysts could offer additional sites to break the scaling relationship limitation and activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off. Challenges and solutions of CO2RR electrolysis in flow reactors are highlighted for improved CO2 utilization, reaction kinetics, and mass transport.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a promising approach to achieving sustainable electrical&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion and storage while decarbonizing the emission&#8208;heavy industry. The carbon&#8208;supported, nitrogen&#8208;coordinated, and atomically dispersed metal sites are effective catalysts for CO generation due to their high activity, selectivity, and earth abundance. Here, we discuss progress, challenges, and opportunities for designing and engineering atomic metal catalysts from single to dual metal sites. Engineering single metal sites using a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon model was highlighted to exclusively study the effect of carbon particle sizes, metal contents, and M&#8722;N bond structures in the form of MN4 moieties on catalytic activity and selectivity. The structure&#8208;property correlation was analyzed by combining experimental results with theoretical calculations to uncover the CO2 to CO conversion mechanisms. Furthermore, dual&#8208;metal site catalysts, inheriting the merits of single&#8208;metal sites, have emerged as a new frontier due to their potentially enhanced catalytic properties. Designing optimal dual metal site catalysts could offer additional sites to alter the surface adsorption to CO2 and various intermediates, thus breaking the scaling relationship limitation and activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off. The CO2RR electrolysis in flow reactors was discussed to provide insights into the electrolyzer design with improved CO2 utilization, reaction kinetics, and mass transport.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Azahomocorannulenyl Cations and Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tropyl ions and radicals are representative non&#8208;alternant hydrocarbons that offer interesting properties, but their synthesis has been rather limited. A series of &#960;&#8208;extended azahomocorannulene molecules possessing a tropyl cation or radical unit have now been synthesized and their electronic and optical properties were investigated.







Abstract
Cycloheptatrienyl (tropyl) molecules are representative non&#8208;alternant hydrocarbons that offer interesting chemistry because of their unique structures and properties. However, there have been a limited number of polycyclic aromatic tropyl cations and radicals reported in the literature. Herein, we report the synthesis of a series of azahomocorannulene derivatives, where the key reactions are a 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of polycyclic aromatic azomethine ylides with dibenzotropone and a subsequent palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclization. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed that the obtained azahomocorannulenyl cation and radical adopt planar structures and exhibit unique packing structures. Their electronic and optical properties were investigated experimentally and theoretically to reveal their aromatic character.

         <title>Nanocatalytic Anti&#8208;Tumor Immune Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Immunotherapy has brought a new dawn for human being to defeat cancer. Although existing immunotherapy regimens (CAR&#8208;T, etc.) have made breakthroughs in the treatments of hematological cancer and few solid tumors such as melanoma, the therapeutic efficacy on most solid tumors is still far from being satisfactory. In recent years, the researches on tumor immunotherapy based on nanocatalytic materials are under rapid development, and significant progresses have been made. Nanocatalytic medicine has been demonstrated to be capable of overcoming the limitations of current clinicnal treatments by using toxic chemodrugs, and exhibits highly attractive advantages over traditional therapies, such as the enhanced and sustained therapeutic efficacy&#160;based on the durable&#160;catalytic activity, remarkably reduced harmful side&#8208;effects without using traditional toxic chemodrugs, and so on. Most recently, nanocatalytic medicine has been introduced in the immune&#8208;regulation for disease treatments, especially, in the immunoactivation for tumor therapies. This article presents the most recent progresses in immune&#8208;response activations by nanocatalytic medicine&#8208;initiated chemical reactions for tumor immunotherapy, and elucidates the mechanism of nanocatalytic medicines in regulating anti&#8208;tumor immunity. By reviewing the current research progress&#160;in the emerging field, this review will further highlight the great potentials and broad prospects of nanocatalysis&#8208;based anti&#8208;tumor immune&#8208;therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have achieved the first total synthesis of bipolarolides A and B, which possess an intriguing and complex 5/6/6/6/5 caged pentacyclic skeleton with seven contiguous stereocenters. The synthesis features a lithium&#8208;halogen exchange/intermolecular nucleophilic addition to link two enantioenriched fragments, two ring&#8208;closing metathesis reactions to assemble the five&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered rings, and a bioinspired Prins reaction/ether formation cascade cyclization to construct the 5/6/6/6/5 caged skeleton.</dc:description>

         <title>Uniformly Distributed Mixed Matrix Membranes via a Solution Processable Strategy for Propylene/Propane Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanocomposite named as ZIF&#8208;67@Ag4tz4 was introduced into 6FDA&#8208;TMPDA to give advanced mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) for propylene/propane separation. The dual&#8208;facilitated mechanism (facilitate transport and molecular sieving) of the nanocomposite results in a significantly improved propylene/propane selectivity, which was clarified with the help of computational studies.







Abstract
Aggregation of filler particles during the formation of mixed matrix membranes is difficult to avoid when filler loadings exceed a 10&#8211;15&#8197;wt&#8201;%. Such agglomeration usually leads to poor membrane performance. In this work, using a ZIF&#8208;67 metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) as filler along with surface modification of Ag4tz4 to improve processability and selective olefin adsorption, we demonstrate that highly loaded with a very low agglomeration degree membranes can be synthesized displaying unmatched separation selectivity (39) for C3H6/C3H8 mixtures and high permeability rates (99&#8197;Barrer), far surpassing previous reports in the literature. Through molecular dynamics simulation, the enhanced compatibility between ZIF&#8208;67 and polymer matrix with adding Ag4tz4 was proven and the tendency in gas permeability and C3H6 selectivity in the mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) were well explained. More importantly, the membrane showed a wide range of pressure and temperature resistance, together with remarkable long&#8208;term stability (&gt;900&#8197;h). The modification method might help solve interface issues in MMMs and can be extended to the fabrication of other fillers to achieve high performance MMMs for gas separation.

         <title>Towards Optical Information Recording: A Robust Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Molecular Photoswitch with the Ring&#8208;Closure Reaction Yield Exceeding 96.3&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel all&#8208;visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven molecular switch, TPAP&#8722;DTE, was facilely synthesized by endcapping the photochromic dithienylethene (DTE) core with triphenylamine phenyl (TPAP) groups. TPAP&#8722;DTE undergoes a quasi&#8208;quantitative ring&#8208;closure reaction with a yield &gt;96.3&#8201;% upon 405&#8197;nm visible&#8208;light irradiation. It remains robust even after 100&#8197;photoswitching cycles and 1000&#8208;hour aging test, and demonstrates versatility in optical information recording.







Abstract
Diarylethene molecular photoswitches hold great fascination as optical information materials due to their unique bistability and exceptional reversible photoswitching properties. Conventional diarylethenes, however, rely on UV light for ring&#8208;closure reactions, typically with modest yields. For practical application, diarylethenes driven by visible lights are preferred but achieving high ring&#8208;closure reaction yield remains a significant challenge. Herein, we synthesized a novel all&#8208;visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photoswitch, TPAP&#8722;DTE, by facilely endcapping the dithienylethene (DTE) core with triphenylamine phenyl (TPAP) groups. Owing to the electron&#8208;donating conjugation effect of TPAP, the open&#8208;form TPAP&#8722;DTE responds strongly to short&#8208;wavelength visible lights with considerable photocyclization quantum yields and molar absorption coefficient. Upon 405&#8197;nm visible&#8208;light irradiation, TPAP&#8722;DTE achieves a ring&#8208;closure reaction yield exceeding 96.3&#8201;% (confirmed by both nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography). Its ring&#8208;opening reaction yield is 100&#8201;% upon irradiation with long&#8208;wavelength visible light. TPAP&#8722;DTE could be regarded as a bidirectional &#8220;quasi&#8221;&#8208;quantitative conversion molecular switch. Furthermore, TPAP&#8722;DTE exhibits robust fatigue resistance over 100&#8197;full photoswitching cycles and great anti&#8208;aging property under 85&#8201;&#176;C and 85&#8201;% humidity for at least 1000&#8197;h. Consequently, its rewritable QR&#8208;code, multilevel data storage, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting/encryption applications are successfully demonstrated exclusively using visible lights, positioning TPAP&#8722;DTE as a highly promising medium for information recording.

         <title>The Molecular Basis of Human ALKBH3 Mediated RNA N1&#8208;methyladenosine (m1A) Demethylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distinct RNA m1A substrate recognition and demethylation catalytic mechanisms of ALKBH3 were reported. It utilized a non&#8208;conserved &#946;&#8208;hairpin as well as two bubble regions inside the active pocket generated by two key residues Asp194 and Thr133 to achieve single stranded substrates preferential recognition and demethylation catalysis.







Abstract
N1&#8208;methyladenosine (m1A) is a prevalent post&#8208;transcriptional RNA modification, and the distribution and dynamics of the modification play key epitranscriptomic roles in cell development. At present, the human AlkB Fe(II)/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase family member ALKBH3 is the only known mRNA m1A demethylase, but its catalytic mechanism remains unclear. Here, we present the structures of ALKBH3&#8208;oligo crosslinked complexes obtained with the assistance of a synthetic antibody crystallization chaperone. Structural and biochemical results showed that ALKBH3 utilized two &#946;&#8208;hairpins (&#946;4&#8208;loop&#8208;&#946;5 and &#946;&#8242;&#8208;loop&#8208;&#946;&#8242;&#8242;) and the &#945;2 helix to facilitate single&#8208;stranded substrate binding. Moreover, a bubble&#8208;like region around Asp194 and a key residue inside the active pocket (Thr133) enabled specific recognition and demethylation of m1A&#8208; and 3&#8208;methylcytidine (m3C)&#8208;modified substrates. Mutation of Thr133 to the corresponding residue in the AlkB Fe(II)/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase family members FTO or ALKBH5 converted ALKBH3 substrate selectivity from m1A to N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A), as did Asp194 deletion. Our findings provide a molecular basis for understanding the mechanisms of substrate recognition and m1A demethylation by ALKBH3. This study is expected to aid structure&#8208;guided design of chemical probes for further functional studies and therapeutic applications.

         <title>Craig&#8208;H&#252;ckel Hybrid Aromatic Metalla&#8208;dehydro[11]annulenes Constructed by a Formal [10+1] Cycloaddition Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of metalla&#8208;dehydro[11]annulenes with Craig&#8208;H&#252;ckel hybrid aromaticity, were constructed by a one pot [10+1] strategy. They are the first monometallic aromatic metalla&#8208;[n]annulenes with the ring size larger than 6, and their special aromaticity was confirmed both experimentally and theoretically. This work provides a method to construct large metalla&#8208;annulenes with different ring sizes, which is significant for metalla&#8208;aromatic chemistry.







Abstract
Aromatic metalla&#8208;annulenes are important aromatic compounds, research into which has been mainly concentrated on metal&#8208;benzenes and their lower homologues. Reports on their superior homologs are rare, and this has greatly limited the systematic study of their properties. In this work, a series of osma&#8208;dehydro[11]annulenes with good air and thermal stability were prepared in high yields through a simple [10+1] strategy, by incorporating a metal fragment into conjugated ten&#8208;carbon chains in a one&#8208;pot reaction. They are the first monometallic aromatic metalla&#8208;[n]annulenes with the ring size larger than 6, and their Craig&#8208;H&#252;ckel hybrid aromaticity is supported by various physical and computational parameters. Besides, these complexes show versatile reactivities, not only giving further evidence for their aromaticity, but also demonstrating their physical and chemical properties can easily be regulated. This work enriches the metalla&#8208;aromatic chemistry, and provides a new avenue for the synthesis of large metalla&#8208;annulenes with different ring sizes.

&lt;p&gt;A series of metalla-dehydro[11]annulenes with Craig-H&#252;ckel hybrid aromaticity, were constructed by a one pot [10+1] strategy. They are the first monometallic aromatic metalla-[n]annulenes with the ring size larger than 6, and their special aromaticity was confirmed both experimentally and theoretically. This work provides a method to construct large metalla-annulenes with different ring sizes, which is significant for metalla-aromatic chemistry.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aromatic metalla-annulenes are important aromatic compounds, research into which has been mainly concentrated on metal-benzenes and their lower homologues. Reports on their superior homologs are rare, and this has greatly limited the systematic study of their properties. In this work, a series of osma-dehydro[11]annulenes with good air and thermal stability were prepared in high yields through a simple [10+1] strategy, by incorporating a metal fragment into conjugated ten-carbon chains in a one-pot reaction. They are the first monometallic aromatic metalla-[&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]annulenes with the ring size larger than 6, and their Craig-H&#252;ckel hybrid aromaticity is supported by various physical and computational parameters. Besides, these complexes show versatile reactivities, not only giving further evidence for their aromaticity, but also demonstrating their physical and chemical properties can easily be regulated. This work enriches the metalla-aromatic chemistry, and provides a new avenue for the synthesis of large metalla-annulenes with different ring sizes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discrimination of Disaccharide Isomers of Different Glycosidic Linkages Using a Modified MspA Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered MspA nanopore was applied to discriminate between disaccharide isomers with different glycosidic linkages. An overall identification accuracy of 99&#8201;% was achieved, suggesting its potential use in the determination of glycosidic linkage and chemical analysis.







Abstract
Disaccharides are composed of two monosaccharide subunits joined by a glycosidic linkage in an &#945; or &#946; configuration. Different combinations of isomeric monosaccharide subunits and different glycosidic linkages result in different isomeric disaccharide products. Thus, direct discrimination of these disaccharide isomers from a mixture is extremely difficult. In this paper, a hetero&#8208;octameric Mycobacterium smegmatis porin&#8197;A (MspA) nanopore conjugated with a phenylboronic acid (PBA) adapter was applied for disaccharide sensing, with which three most widely known disaccharides in nature, including sucrose, lactose and maltose, were clearly discriminated. Besides, all six isomeric &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranosyl&#8208;D&#8208;fructoses, differing only in their glycosidic linkages, were also well resolved. Assisted by a custom machine learning algorithm, a 0.99 discrimination accuracy is achieved. Nanopore discrimination of disaccharide isomers with different glycosidic linkages, which has never been previously demonstrated, is inspiring for nanopore saccharide sequencing. This sensing capacity was also applied in direct identification of isomaltulose additives in a commercial sucrose&#8208;free yogurt, from which isomaltulose, lactose and L&#8208;lactic acid were simultaneously detected.

         <title>Molecular Dynamic Simulations of Aqueous Micellar Organometallic Catalysis: Methane Functionalization as a Case Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular Dynamics have been applied to the study of the dynamics of a catalytic organometallic micellar system, in the first example of such investigations using a methane functionalization case.







Abstract
Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations constitute a powerful tool that provides a 3D perspective of the dynamical behavior of chemical systems. Herein the first MD study of the dynamics of a catalytic organometallic system, in micellar media, is presented. The challenging methane catalytic functionalization into ethyl propionate through a silver&#8208;catalyzed process has been targeted as the case study. The intimate nature of the micelles formed with the surfactants sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) and potassium perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) has been ascertained, as well as the relative distribution of the main actors in this transformation, namely methane, the diazo reagent and the silver catalyst, the latter in two different forms: the initial compound and a silver&#8208;carbene intermediate. Catalyst deactivation occurs with halide containing surfactants dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride (DTAC) and Triton X&#8208;100. Computed simulations allow explaining the experimental results, indicating that micelles behave differently regarding the degree of accumulation and the local distribution of the reactants and their effect in the molecular collisions leading to net reaction.

         <title>Multicomponent Cyclizative 1,2&#8208;Rearrangement Enabled Enantioselective Construction of 2,2&#8208;Disubstituted Pyrrolinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first organocatalyzed multicomponent asymmetric 1,2&#8208;rearrangement is established, which provides a straightforward access to 2,2&#8208;disubstituted pyrrolinones in excellent chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivities. This reaction also represents the first example of asymmetric catalytic construction of chiral pyrrolinones bearing aza&#8208;quaternary stereocenters.







Abstract
The 1,2&#8208;rearrangement reaction is one of the most important approaches to construct carbon&#8208;carbon bonds in organic synthesis. However, the development of catalytic asymmetric 1,2&#8208;rearrangements is still far from mature and often suffers from problems such as complex substrates, single product structure, and lack of synthetic application. Multicomponent reaction has been recognized as a robust tool for the synthesis of diverse and tunable products from readily available starting material. Conceptionally and practically, the development of multicomponent asymmetric 1,2&#8208;rearrangements is highly desirable. In this regard, we report herein a three&#8208;component benzilic acid&#8208;type rearrangement of 2,3&#8208;diketoesters, aromatic amines and aldehydes for the asymmetric construction of synthetically challenging pyrrolinones bearing aza&#8208;quaternary stereocenters. To the best of our knowledge, this reaction represents the first example of organocatalyzed multicomponent asymmetric 1,2&#8208;rearrangements.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solvent and catalyst free thermolysis of arylated biphenylenes provides one&#8208;step access to [n]cyclo&#8208;ortho&#8208;phenylenes ([n]COPs, n=4&#8211;10) while avoiding linear oligomers. Solubilizing substituents allow separation of these macrocycles by recycling&#8208;GPC. In the crystalline state, [6]COP displays an alternating crown&#8208;shaped conformation.







Abstract
The solvent and catalyst free thermolysis of biphenylenes at 350&#8201;&#176;C furnishes [n]cyclo&#8208;ortho&#8208;phenylenes ([n]COPs, n=4&#8211;10) in one step and in high yields. At 400&#8201;&#176;C biphenylene dimerizes into tetraphenylene, but lower reaction temperatures produce cyclooligomers. If suitably substituted, the oligomers are soluble and can be isolated and characterized. The products are exclusively cyclic. In the crystalline state, [6]COP displays an alternating crown&#8208;shaped conformation.

         <title>A Catalytic Method to Activate Nitromethane by the Cooperation of Homo&#8208; and Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic activation of bulk chemical nitromethane (MeNO2) enables the facile synthesis of amides and nitriles from ketone, aldehyde, and alkyne substrates. This method eliminates the need for stoichiometric reductants or activators, opening up new possibilities for MeNO2 as a nitrogen source in organic synthesis.







Abstract
The achievement of directly activating and utilizing bulk small molecules has remained a longstanding objective in the field of chemical synthesis. The present work reports a catalytic activation method for bulk chemical nitromethane (MeNO2). This method combines homogeneous Lewis acid with recyclable heterogeneous Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis, featuring practicality, sustainability, and low cost, thus solving the inherent drawbacks of previous Nef processes where stoichiometric reductants or activators were required. By combining the advantages of both homo&#8208; and heterogeneous catalysts, this chemistry may not only offer new opportunities for the further development of MeNO2 as a nitrogen source for organic synthesis, but also promote the catalysis design in synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Quantitative N&#8208; or C&#8208;Terminal Labelling of Proteins with Unactivated Peptides by Use of Sortases and a d&#8208;Aminopeptidase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generalised coupling strategy to enable quantitative N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminal labelling of proteins using unmodified peptides and readily produced catalysts is described. For C&#8208;terminal labelling, a small excess of the labelling peptide is required, but for N&#8208;terminal labelling, equimolar quantities of labelling reagents can be used to achieve quantitative labelling.







Abstract
Quantitative and selective labelling of proteins is widely used in both academic and industrial laboratories, and catalytic labelling of proteins using transpeptidases, such as sortases, has proved to be a popular strategy for such selective modification. A major challenge for this class of enzymes is that the majority of procedures require an excess of the labelling reagent or, alternatively, activated substrates rather than simple commercially sourced peptides. We report the use of a coupled enzyme strategy which enables quantitative N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminal labelling of proteins using unactivated labelling peptides. The use of an aminopeptidase in conjunction with a transpeptidase allows sequence&#8208;specific degradation of the peptide by&#8208;product, shifting the equilibrium to favor product formation, which greatly enhances the reaction efficiency. Subsequent optimisation of the reaction allows N&#8208;terminal labelling of proteins using essentially equimolar ratios of peptide label to protein and C&#8208;terminal labelling with only a small excess. Minimizing the amount of substrate required for quantitative labelling has the potential to improve industrial processes and facilitate the use of transpeptidation as a method for protein labelling.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence of Benzils Achieved by Chiral Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral supramolecular polymerization provides a novel and effective approach for developing circularly polarized phosphorescent materials, which combines inherent film&#8208;forming capabilities with intense and color&#8208;tunable circularly polarized phosphorescent signals.







Abstract
In current approaches for circularly polarized phosphorescent materials, the crystallization of chiral phosphors suffers from poor processability, while integrating them into an amorphous polymer matrix results in unsatisfactory chiroptical signals due to the absence of chirality communication. Here, we have developed an innovative strategy through chiral supramolecular polymerization of benzil phosphors facilitated by intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The inherent film&#8208;forming capabilities of non&#8208;covalent supramolecular polymers obviate the need for an external polymer matrix. The pronounced helical asymmetry of benzil phosphors resulting from chiral supramolecular polymerization leads to enhanced circularly polarized phosphorescence compared to their non&#8208;hydrogen&#8208;bonded counterparts. The circularly polarized phosphorescent signals can be further modulated by varying the location of stereogenic centers or introducing halogen bonding to benzils. Incorporation of platinum(II) phosphor into the benzil supramolecular polymers induces both chirality and triplet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet energy transfer, leading to a change in circularly polarized phosphorescent color from yellow to red. In summary, chiral supramolecular polymerization of phosphors represents a novel and effective approach to circularly polarized phosphorescent materials.

         <title>Effect of Alkali&#8208; and Alkaline&#8208;Earth&#8208;Metal Promoters on Silica&#8208;Supported Co&#8722;Fe Alloy for Autocatalytic CO2 Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkali&#8208; and alkaline&#8208;earth&#8208;metal&#8208;promoted Co&#8722;Fe bimetallic catalysts on silica can convert CO2 and H2O to crucial metabolites such as formate, acetate, pyruvate as well as hydrocarbons under mild hydrothermal vent conditions. With alkali&#8208; and alkaline&#8208;earth metals abundant in hydrothermal vents, our study simulates how the geochemical process can fix CO2 before biochemical CO2 fixation would come into play.







Abstract
Hydrothermal vents harbor numerous microbial communities rich in reduced carbon species such as formate, acetate, and hydrocarbons. Such essential chemicals for life are produced by H2&#8208;dependent CO2 reduction, where serpentinization provides continuous H2 and thermal energy. Here, we show that silica&#8208;supported bimetallic Co&#8722;Fe alloys, naturally occurring minerals around serpentinite, can convert CO2 and H2O to key metabolic intermediates of the acetyl coenzyme A pathway such as formate (up to 72&#8197;mM), acetate, and pyruvate under mild hydrothermal vent conditions. Long&#8208;chain hydrocarbons up to C6 including propene are also detected, just as in the Lost City hydrothermal field. The effects of promoters on structural properties and catalytic functionalities of the Co&#8722;Fe alloy are systematically investigated by incorporating a series of alkali and alkaline earth metals including Na, Mg, K, and Ca. Alkali and alkaline earth metals resulted in higher formate concentrations when dissolved in water and increased reaction pH, while alkaline earth metals also favored the formation of insoluble hydroxides and carbonates similar to the constituent minerals of the chimneys at the Lost City hydrothermal fields.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Mediated Magnetism&#8208;Conversion Nanoprobes for Activatable Ultra&#8208;High Field Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultra&#8208;high field (UHF) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged as a focal point of interest in the field of cancer diagnosis. Despite the ability of current paramagnetic or superparamagnetic smart MRI contrast agents to selectively enhance tumor signals in low&#8208;field MRI, their effectiveness at UHF remains inadequate due to inherent magnetism. Here, we report a ligand&#8208;mediated magnetism&#8208;conversion nanoprobe (MCNP) composed of 3&#8208;mercaptopropionic acid ligand&#8208;coated silver&#8208;gadolinium bimetallic nanoparticles. The MCNP exhibits a pH&#8208;dependent magnetism conversion from ferromagnetism to diamagnetism, facilitating tunable nanomagnetism for pH&#8208;activatable UHF MRI. Under neutral pH, the thiolate (&#8208;S&#8208;) ligands lead to short &#964;'m and increased magnetization of the MCNPs. Conversely, in the acidic tumor microenvironment, the thiolate ligands are protonated and transform into thiol (&#8208;SH) ligands, resulting in prolonged &#964;'m and decreased magnetization of the MCNP, thereby enhancing longitudinal relaxivity (r1) values at UHF MRI. Notably, under a 9 T MRI field, the pH&#8208;sensitive changes in Ag&#8208;S binding affinity of the MCNP lead to a remarkable (&gt;10&#8208;fold) r1 increase in an acidic medium (pH 5.0). In vivo studies demonstrate the capability of MCNPs to amplify MRI signal of hepatic tumors, suggesting their potential as a next&#8208;generation UHF&#8208;tailored smart MRI contrast agent.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Engineered W18O49&#8208;x Nanobrush with a Suitable Band Structure for Highly Efficient Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the rapid development of external minimally invasive or noninvasive therapeutic modalities, ultrasound&#8208;based sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is a new alternative for treating deep tumors. However, inadequate sonosensitizer efficiency and poor biosecurity limit clinical applications. In this study, we prepared an oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;engineered W18O49&#8208;x nanobrush with a 2.79 eV bandgap for highly efficient SDT using a simple solvothermal method. The suitable band structures of the W18O49&#8208;x nanobrush endows it with the potential to simultaneously produce singlet oxygen (1O2), superoxide anions (&#8226;O2&#8722;), and hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) under ultrasound irradiation. Additionally, abundant oxygen vacancies that serve as further charge traps that inhibit electron&#8211;hole recombination are incidentally introduced through one&#8208;step thermal reduction. Collectively, the in&#8208;vitro and in&#8208;vivo results demonstrate that the oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;engineered W18O49&#8208;x nanobrush delivers highly efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) for SDT in a very biosafe manner. Overall, this study provides a new avenue for discovering and designing inorganic nanosonosensitizers with enhanced therapeutic efficiencies for use in SDT.</dc:description>

         <title>Phase Behaviors of Charged Star Block Copolymers at Fluids Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The phase behaviors of block copolymers (BCPs) at the water&#8208;oil interface are influenced by the segmental interaction parameter (&#967;) and chain architecture. We synthesized a series of star block copolymers (s&#8208;BCPs) having polystyrene (PS) as core and poly(2&#8208;vinylpyridine) (P2VP) as corona. The interaction parameters of block&#8208;block (&#967;PS&#8208;P2VP) and block&#8208;solvent (&#967;P2VP&#8208;solvent) were varied by adjusting the pH of the aqueous solution. Lowering pH increased the fraction of quaternized&#8208;P2VP (Q&#8208;P2VP) with enhanced hydrophilicity. By transferring the equilibrated interfacial assemblies, morphologies ranging from bicontinuous films at pH of 7 and 3.1 to nanoporous and nanotubular structure at pH of 0.65 were observed. The nanoporous films formed hexagonally packed pores in s&#8208;BCP matrix, while nanotubes comprised Q&#8208;P2VP as corona and PS as core. Control over pore size, d&#8208;spacing between pores, and nanotube diameters was achieved by varying polymer concentration, molecular weight, volume fraction and arm number of s&#8208;BCPs. Large&#8208;scale nanoporous films were obtained by freeze&#8208;drying emulsions. Remarkably, the morphologies of linear BCPs were inverted, forming hexagonal&#8208;packed rigid spherical micelles with Q&#8208;P2VP as core and PS as corona in multilayer. This work provides insights of phase behaviors of BCP at fluids interface and offer a facile approach to prepare nanoporous film&#160;with well&#8208;controlled pore structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;18 Labeling Reveals a Mixed Fe&#8208;O Mechanism in the Last Step of Cytochrome P450 51 Sterol 14&#945;&#8208;Demethylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 14&#945;&#8208;demethylation step is critical in eukaryotic sterol biosynthesis, catalyzed by cytochrome P450 (P450) Family 51 enzymes, e.g. with lanosterol in mammals. This conserved 3&#8208;step reaction terminates in a C&#8208;C cleavage step that generates formic acid, the nature of which has been controversial. Proposed mechanisms involve roles of P450 Compound 0 (ferric peroxide anion, FeO2&#175;) or Compound I (perferryl oxygen, FeO3+) reacting with either the aldehyde or its hydrate, respectively. Analysis of&#160;18O incorporation into formic acid from&#160;18O2&#160;provides a means of distinguishing the two mechanisms. Human P450 51A1 incorporated 88%&#160;18O (one atom) into formic acid, consistent with a major but not exclusive FeO2&#175; mechanism. Two P450 51 orthologs from amoeba and yeast showed similar results, while two orthologs from pathogenic trypanosomes showed roughly equal contributions of both mechanisms. An X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the human enzyme showed the aldehyde oxygen 3.5 &#197; away from the heme iron. Experiments with human P450 51A1 and H218O yielded primarily one&#160;18O atom but 14% of the formic acid product with two&#160;18O atoms, indicative of a minor contribution of a Compound I mechanism. LC&#8208;MS evidence for a Compound 0&#8208;derived Baeyer&#8208;Villiger reaction product (a 14&#945;&#8208;formyl ester) was also found.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing Efficient Single Metal Atom Biocatalysts at the Atomic Structure Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Various nanomaterials as biocatalysts could be custom&#8208;designed and modified to precisely match the specific microenvironment of diseases, showing a promise in achieving effective therapy outcome. Compared to conventional biocatalysts, single metal atom catalysts (SMACs) with the maximized atom utilization through well&#8208;defined structures offer enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity and enable the exploration of catalytic activity and the examination of structure&#8208;mechanism interactions. There is still a gap in the comprehensive overview encompassing the interplay among the structure, catalytic mechanism, and biomedical applications of SMACs. Therefore, it is crucial to deeply investigate the role of SMACs in biocatalysis from the atomic structure level and to elucidate their potential mechanisms in biocatalytic processes. In this mini&#8208;review, we summarize catalysis regulation methods of SMACs at the atomic structure level, focusing on the optimization of catalytic active sites, coordination environment, and active site&#8208;support interactions, and discuss biocatalytic mechanisms for biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Iodinated Electron Acceptor with Significantly Extended Exciton Diffusion Length for Efficient Organic Photovoltaic Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iodination has unlocked new potentials in organic photovoltaics (OPVs). A newly designed and synthesized iodinated non&#8208;fullerene acceptor, BO&#8208;4I, showcases exceptional excitation delocalization property with the exciton diffusion length increased to 80 nm. The enhanced electron delocalization property is attributed to the larger atomic radius and electron orbit of the iodine atom, which facilitates the formation of intra&#8208;moiety excitations in the acceptor phase. This effectively circumvents the charge transfer state&#8208;related recombination mechanisms, leading to a substantial reduction in non&#8208;radiative energy loss (&#916;Enr). As a result, OPV cell based on PBDB&#8208;TF:BO&#8208;4I achieves an impressive efficiency of 18.9% with a notable &#916;Enr of 0.189 eV, markedly surpassing their fluorinated counterparts. This contribution highlights the pivotal role of iodination in reducing energy loss, thereby affirming its potential as a key strategy in the development of advanced next&#8208;generation OPV cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Approach for Z&#8208;Vinyl Fluorides by Hydrofluorination of Alkynes bearing SF4 and SF5 Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of vinyl fluorides plays a crucial role in various scientific disciplines, including pharmaceutical and materials sciences. Herein, we present a direct and stereoselective hydrofluorination method for the synthesis of Z isomers of vinyl fluorides from alkynes containing unexplored SF5 and SF4 groups. Our strategy employed tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) as a fluorine source. It demonstrates high compatibility with aryls, biaryls, heteroaryls, and tert&#8208;alkyl groups, allowing facile incorporation of SF5 and SF4 groups across the triple bond without any transition&#8208;metal catalysts. This approach avoids the potential decomposition of the SF5 or SF4 units via coordination with transition metals or acidic protic sources. Remarkably, this transformation proceeded at room temperature without any additional additives, providing the Z isomer of vinyl fluorides in excellent yield and high selectivity. The presence of a water molecule as a hydrate in TBAF is essential for efficient conversion. This methodology opens new avenues for the synthesis of enchanted SF5&#8208; and SF4&#8208;containing fluorinated vinylic scaffolds, thereby providing advanced opportunities for novel drug discovery and fluorinated polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>A High&#8208;Efficiency Bioorthogonal Tumor&#8208;Membrane Reactor for In Situ Selective and Sustained Prodrug Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The site&#8208;specific activation of bioorthogonal prodrugs has provided great opportunities for reducing the severe side effects of chemotherapy. However, the precise control of activation location, sustained drug production at the target site, and high bioorthogonal reaction efficiency in vivo remain great challenges. Here, we propose the construction of tumor cell membrane reactors in vivo to solve the above problems. Specifically, tumor&#8208;targeted liposomes with efficient membrane fusion capabilities are generated to install the bioorthogonal trigger, the amphiphilic tetrazine derivative, on the surface of tumor cells. These predecorated tumor cells act as many living reactors, transforming the tumor into a &#8220;drug factory&#8221; that in situ activates an externally delivered bioorthogonal prodrug, for example intratumorally injected transcyclooctene&#8208;caged doxorubicin. In contrast to the rapid elimination of cargo that is encapsulated and delivered by liposomes, these reactors permit stable retention of bioorthogonal triggers in tumor for 96 h after a single dose of liposomes via intravenous injection, allowing sustained generation of doxorubicin. Interestingly, an additional supplement of liposomes will compensate for the trigger consumed by the reaction and significantly improve the efficiency of the local reaction. This strategy provides a solution to the efficacy versus safety dilemma of tumor chemotherapy.</dc:description>

The reactions proceed efficiently through desymmetrization, kinetic resolution, and parallel kinetic resolution, affording a broad range of chiral isoindolinones in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 92% yield and 99% ee). The synthetic potential of this method was demonstrated by asymmetric synthesis of biological active compounds, such as (S)&#8208;PD172938 and (S)&#8208;Pazinaclone. The resulting chiral isoindolinones also serve as chiral ligands in cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H annulation with alkynes to construct phosphorus stereocenter.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing Multifunctional Biomaterials via Protein Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein self&#8208;assembly is a fundamental biological process where proteins spontaneously organize into complex and functional structures without external direction. This process is crucial for the formation of various biological functionalities. However, when protein self&#8208;assembly fails, it can trigger the development of multiple disorders, thus making understanding this phenomenon extremely important. Up until recently, protein self&#8208;assembly has been solely linked either to biological function or malfunction; however, in the past decade or two it has also been found to hold promising potential as an alternative route for fabricating materials for biomedical applications. It is therefore necessary and timely to summarize the key aspects of protein self&#8208;assembly: how the protein structure and self&#8208;assembly conditions (chemical environments, kinetics, and the physicochemical characteristics of protein complexes) can be utilized to design biomaterials. This minireview focuses on the basic concepts of forming supramolecular structures, and the existing routes for modifications. We then compare the applicability of different approaches, including compartmentalization and self&#8208;assembly monitoring. Finally, based on the cutting&#8208;edge progress made during the last years, we summarize the current knowledge about tailoring a final function by introducing changes in self&#8208;assembly and link it to biomaterials&#8217; performance.</dc:description>

         <title>pH&#8208;Controlled Reversible Folding of Synthetic Copolymers via Formation of &#946;&#8208;Sheet Secondary Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein functions are enabled by their perfectly arranged 3D structure, which is the result of a hierarchical intramolecular folding process. Sequence&#8208;defined polypeptide chains form locally ordered secondary structures (i.e., &#945;&#8208;helix and &#946;&#8208;sheet) through hydrogen bonding between the backbone amides, shaping the overall tertiary structure. To generate similarly complex macromolecular architectures based on synthetic materials, a plethora of strategies have been developed to induce and control the folding of synthetic polymers. However, the degree of complexity of the structure&#8208; driving ensemble of interactions demonstrated by natural polymers is unreached, as synthesizing long sequence&#8208;defined polymers with functional backbones remains a challenge. Herein, we report the synthesis of hybrid peptide&#8208;DMA copolymers via radical Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization (rROP) of peptide containing macrocycles. The resulting synthetic polymers contain sequence&#8208;defined regions of &#946;&#8208;sheet encoding amino acid sequences. Exploiting the pH responsiveness of the embedded sequences, protonation or deprotonation in water induces self&#8208;assembly of the peptide strands at an intramacromolecular level, driving polymer chain folding via formation of &#946;&#8208;sheet secondary structures. We demonstrate that the folding behavior is sequence dependent and reversible.</dc:description>

         <title>Acetamide Electrosynthesis from CO2 and Nitrite in Water</title>

         <dc:description>Renewable electricities driven&#160;electrocatalytic CO2&#160;reduction&#160;reaction (CO2RR) is a promising solution to carbon neutralization, which mainly generate simple carbon products. It is of great importance to produce more valuable C&#8208;N chemicals from CO2&#160;and nitrogen species. However,&#160;it is challenging to co&#8208;reduce CO2&#160;and NO3&#8208;/NO2&#8208;&#160;to generate aldoxime&#160;an important intermediate in the electrocatalytic C&#8208;N coupling process.&#160;Herein, we report&#160;the successful&#160;electrochemical conversion of CO2&#160;and NO2&#8208;&#160;to acetamide for&#160;the first time&#160;over copper catalysts under alkaline condition through a gas diffusion electrode. Operando spectroelectrochemical characterizations and DFT calculations, suggest acetaldehyde and hydroxylamine identified as key intermediates undergo a nucleophilic addition reaction to produce&#160;acetaldoxime, which is then dehydrated to acetonitrile and followed by hydrolysis to give acetamide under highly local alkaline environment and electric field. Moreover, the above mechanism was successfully extended to the formation of phenylacetamide. This study provides a new strategy to synthesize highly valued amides from CO2&#160;and wastewater.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Fully&#8208;Substituted and Configuration&#8208;Defined Alkyl Vinyl Ethers Enabled by Dual&#8208;Functional Copper&#160;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we present a modular, chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselective synthesis of fully&#8208;substituted and configuration&#8208;defined alkyl vinyl ethers (AVEs) using simple chemical feedstocks. The distinctive approach involves the chemo&#8208; and regioselective functionalization of the CF2 unit in gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes with O&#8208;H and C&#8208;H nucleophiles in a specific order. The resulting highly functionalized cyclopropanyl ethers then undergo a stereoselective ring&#8208;opening process to produce fully&#8208;substituted and configuration&#8208;defined AVEs. These AVEs are rarely accessible through conventional methods and are easily transformable. Mechanistic experiments indicate that the success of this method relies on the use of dual&#8208;functional copper catalysis, which is involved in both the functionalization of the CF2 unit and the subsequent ring&#8208;opening process.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Assisted Li&#8208;N2 Batteries with Enhanced Nitrogen Fixation and Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8208;N2 batteries have received widespread attention for their potential to integrate N2 fixation, energy storage, and conversion. However, because of the low activity and poor stability of cathode catalysts, the electrochemical performance of Li&#8208;N2 batteries is suboptimal, and their electrochemical reversibility has rarely been proven. In this study, a novel bifunctional photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;N2 battery system was established by employing a plasmonic Au nanoparticles (NPs)&#8208;modified defective carbon nitride (Au&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4) photocathode. The Au&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4 exhibits strong light&#8208;harvesting, N2 adsorption, and N2 activation abilities, and the photogenerated electrons and hot electrons are remarkably beneficial for accelerating the discharge and charge reaction kinetics. These advantages enable the photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;N2 battery to achieve a low overpotential of 1.32 V, which is the lowest overpotential reported to date, as well as superior rate capability and prolonged cycle stability (~500 h). Remarkably, a combination of theoretical and experimental results demonstrates the high reversibility of the photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;N2 battery. The proposed novel strategy for developing efficient cathode catalysts and fabricating photo&#8208;assisted battery systems breaks through the overpotential bottleneck of Li&#8208;N2 batteries, providing important insights into the mechanism underlying N2 fixation and storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly of Curved Aromatics: From Donor&#8211;Acceptor Porphyrins to Triply Periodic Minimal Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A saddle&#8208;shaped &#960;&#8208;extended zinc porphyrin containing a peripheral pyridyl ligand undergoes quantitative self&#8208;assembly into a cyclic trimer. The trimer has a prismatic structure with negatively curved side walls, which promote the formation of supramolecular organic frameworks stabilized by dispersion interactions. The first framework type, UWr&#8208;1, has the npo topology, with a hexagonal structure analogous to the Schwartz H triply periodic minimal surface. Co&#8208;crystallization of the trimer with either C60 and C70 produces the isomorphous cubic UWr&#8208;2 and UWr&#8208;3 phases, characterized by the ctn network topology and a structural relationship to the Fischer&#8211;Koch minimal surface S. All three phases contain complex labyrinths of solvent&#8208;filled channels, corresponding to very large probe&#8208;accessible volumes (68% to 76%). The UWr&#8208;2 network could be partly desolvated while retaining its long range dimensional order, indicating remarkable strength of the dispersion interactions in the crystal. A theoretical analysis of noncovalent interactions shows the role of geometrical matching between the negatively curved porphyrin units and positively curved fullerenes.</dc:description>

         <title>An ER&#8208;targeted, Viscosity&#8208;sensitive Hemicyanine Dye for the Diagnosis of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver and Photodynamic Cancer Therapy by Activating Pyroptosis Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The concept of molecular design, integrating diagnostic and therapeutic functions, aligns with the general trend of modern medical advancement. Herein, we rationally designed the smart molecule ER&#8208;ZS for endoplasmic reticulum (ER)&#8208;targeted diagnosis and treatment in cell and animal models by combining hemicyanine dyes with ER&#8208;targeted functional groups (p&#8208;toluenesulfonamide). Owing to its ability to target the ER with a highly specific response to viscosity, ER&#8208;ZS demonstrated substantial fluorescence turn&#8208;on only after binding to the ER, independent of other physiological environments. In addition, ER&#8208;ZS, being a small molecule, allows for the diagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) via liver imaging based on high ER stress. Importantly, ER&#8208;ZS is a type I photosensitizer, producing O2&#8226;&#8722; and &#8226;OH under light irradiation. Thus, after irradiating for a certain period, the photodynamic therapy inflicted severe oxidative damage to the ER of tumor cells in hypoxic (2% O2) conditions and activated the unique pyroptosis pathway, demonstrating excellent antitumor capacity in xenograft tumor models. Hence, the proposed strategy will likely shed new light on integrating molecular optics for NAFLD diagnosis and cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Intensified Continuous Flow Process for the Scalable Production of Bio&#8208;Based Glycerol Carbonate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A subtle combination of fundamental and applied organic chemistry toward process intensification is demonstrated for the large&#8208;scale production of bio&#8208;based glycerol carbonate under flow conditions. The direct carbonation of bio&#8208;based glycidol with CO2 is successfully carried out under intensified flow conditions, with Barton&#8217;s base as a potent homogeneous organocatalyst. Process metrics for the CO2 coupling step (for the upstream production, output: 3.6 kg day&#8208;1, Space Time Yield (STY): 2.7 kg h&#8208;1 L&#8208;1, Environmental factor (E&#8208;factor): 4.7) outclass previous reports. High conversion and selectivity are achieved in less than 30 s of residence time at pilot scale with a stoichiometric amount of CO2. Supporting DFT computations reveal the unique features of the mechanism in presence of Br&#248;nsted bases.</dc:description>

         <title>A&#160;Giant Heterometallic Polyoxometalate Nanocluster for Enhanced Brain&#8208;Targeted Glioma Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Giant heterometallic polyoxometalate (POM) clusters with precise atom structures, flexibly adjustable and abundant active sites are promising for constructing functional nanodrugs. However, current POM drugs are almost vacant in orthotopic brain tumor therapy due to the inability to effectively penetrate the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) and low drug activity. Here, we designed the largest (3.0 nm &#215; 6.0 nm) transition&#8208;metal&#8211;lanthanide co&#8208;encapsulated POM cluster {[Ce10Ag6(DMEA)(H2O)27W22O70][B&#8208;&#945;&#8208;TeW9O33]9}288&#8211; featuring 238 metal centers via synergistic coordination between two geometry&#8208;unrestricted Ce3+ and Ag+ linkers with tungsten&#8208;oxo cluster fragments. This POM was combined with brain&#8208;targeted peptide to prepare a brain&#8208;targeted nanodrug that could efficiently traverse BBB and target glioma cells. The Ag+ active centers in the nanodrug specifically activate reactive oxygen species to regulate glioma cell apoptosis pathway with a low half&#8208;maximal inhibitory concentration (5.66 &#956;M). As the first brain&#8208;targeted POM drug, it efficiently prolongs the survival of orthotopic glioma&#8208;bearing mice.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Upcycling of Polyethylene Terephthalate towards High&#8208;valued Oxygenated Chemical Methyl p&#8208;Methyl Benzoate using a Cu/ZrO2 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Upgrading of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste into valuable oxygenated molecules is a fascinating process, yet it remains challenging. Herein, we developed a two&#8208;step strategy involving methanolysis of PET to dimethyl terephthalate (DMT), followed by hydrogenation of DMT to produce the high&#8208;valued chemical methyl p&#8208;methyl benzoate (MMB) using a fixed&#8208;bed reactor and a Cu/ZrO2 catalyst. Interestingly, we discovered the phase structure of ZrO2 significantly regulates the selectivity of products. Cu supported on monoclinic ZrO2 (5%Cu/m&#8208;ZrO2) exhibits an exceptional selectivity of 86% for conversion of DMT to MMB, while Cu supported on tetragonal ZrO2 (5%Cu/t&#8208;ZrO2) predominantly produces p&#8208;xylene (PX) with selectivity of 75%. The superior selectivity of MMB over Cu/m&#8208;ZrO2 can be attributed to the weaker acid sites present on m&#8208;ZrO2 compared to t&#8208;ZrO2. This weak acidity of m&#8208;ZrO2 leads to a moderate adsorption capability of MMB, and facilitating its desorption. Furthermore, DFT calculations reveal Cu/m&#8208;ZrO2 catalyst shows a higher effective energy barrier for cleavage of second C&#8211;O bond compared to Cu/t&#8208;ZrO2 catalyst; this distinction ensures the high selectivity of MMB. This catalyst not only presents an approach for upgrading of PET waste into fine chemicals but also offers a strategy for controlling the primary product in a multistep hydrogenation reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Disclosing Support&#8208;Size&#8208;Dependent Effect on Ambient Light&#8208;Driven Photothermal CO2 Hydrogenation over Nickel/Titanium Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The size of support in heterogeneous catalysts can strongly affect the catalytic property but is rarely explored in light&#8208;driven catalysis. Herein, we demonstrate the size of TiO2 support governs the selectivity in photothermal CO2 hydrogenation by tuning the metal&#8208;support interactions (MSI). Small&#8208;size TiO2 loading nickel (Ni/TiO2&#8208;25) with enhanced MSI promotes photo&#8208;induced electrons of TiO2 migrating to Ni nanoparticles, thus favoring the H2 cleavage and accelerating the CH4 formation (227.7 mmol g&#8201;&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) under xenon light&#8208;induced temperature of 360&#8201;&#176;C. Conversely, Ni/TiO2&#8208;100 with large TiO2 prefers yielding CO (94.2 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1) due to weak MSI, inefficient charge separation, and inadequate supply of activated hydrogen. Under ambient solar irradiation, Ni/TiO2&#8208;25 achieves the optimized CH4 rate (63.0 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1) with selectivity of 99.8%, while Ni/TiO2&#8208;100 exhibits the CO selectivity of 90.0 % with rate of 30.0 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1. This work offers a novel approach to tailoring light&#8208;driven catalytic properties by support size effect.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Skeletal editing of N&#8208;heterocycles has recently received considerable attention, and the introduction of boron atom into heterocycles often results in positive property changes. However, direct enlargement of N&#8208;heterocycles through boron atom insertion is rarely reported in the literature. Here, we report a N&#8208;heterocyclic editing reaction through the combination boron atom insertion and C&#8208;H borylation, accessing the fused BN&#8208;heterocycles. The synthetic potential of this chemistry was demonstrated by substrate scope and late&#8208;stage diversification of products.</dc:description>

         <title>Sonogenetics for Monitoring and Modulating Biomolecular Function by Ultrasound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultrasound technology, synergistically harnessed with genetic engineering and chemistry concepts, has started to open the gateway to the remarkable realm of sonogenetics &#8211; a pioneering paradigm for remotely orchestrating cellular functions at the molecular level. This fusion not only enables precisely targeted imaging and therapeutic interventions, but also advances our comprehension of mechanobiology to unparalleled depths. Sonogenetic tools harness mechanical force within small tissue volumes while preserving the integrity of the surrounding physiological environment, reaching depths of up to tens of centimeters with high spatiotemporal precision. These capabilities circumvent the inherent physical limitations of alternative in vivo control methods such as optogenetics and magnetogenetics. In this review, we first discuss mechanosensitive ion channels, the most commonly utilized sonogenetic mediators, in both mammalian and non&#8208;mammalian systems. Subsequently, we provide a comprehensive overview of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art sonogenetic approaches that leverage thermal or mechanical features of ultrasonic waves. Additionally, we explore strategies centered around the design of mechanochemically reactive macromolecular systems. Furthermore, we delve into the realm of ultrasound imaging of biomolecular function, encompassing the utilization of gas vesicles and acoustic reporter genes. Finally, we shed light on limitations and challenges of sonogenetics and present a perspective on the future of this promising technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Distortion in the Wadsley&#8208;Roth Niobium Molybdenum Oxide Phase Triggering Extraordinarily Stable Battery Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Wadsley&#8208;Roth niobium oxide phases have attracted extensive research interest recently as promising battery anodes. We have synthesized the niobium&#8208;molybdenum oxide shear phase (Nb, Mo)13O33 with superior electrochemical Li&#8208;ion storage performance, including an ultralong cycling lifespan of at least 15000 cycles. During electrochemical cycling, a reversible single&#8208;phase solid&#8208;solution reaction with lithiated intermediate solid solutions is demonstrated using in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, with the valence and short&#8208;range structural changes of the electrode probed by in situ Nb and Mo K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. This work reveals that the superior stability of niobium molybdenum oxides is underpinned by changes in octahedral distortion during electrochemical reactions, and we report an in&#8208;depth understanding of how this stabilizes the oxide structure during cycling with implications for future long&#8208;life battery material design.</dc:description>

         <title>Vinylogous Urea &#8208; Urethane Vitrimers: Accelerating and Inhibiting Network Dynamics through Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinylogous urethane (VUO) based polymer networks are widely used as catalyst&#8208;free vitrimers that show rapid covalent bond exchange at elevated temperatures. In solution, vinylogous ureas (VUN) undergo much faster bond exchange than VUO and are highly dynamic at room temperature. However, this difference in reactivity is not observed in their respective dynamic polymer networks, as VUO and VUN vitrimers prepared herein with very similar macromolecular architectures show comparable stress relaxation and creep behavior. However, by using mixtures of VUO and VUN linkages within the same network, the dynamic reactions can be accelerated by an order of magnitude. The results can be rationalized by the effect of intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which is absent in VUO vitrimers, but is very pronounced for vinylogous urea moieties. At low concentrations of VUN, these hydrogen bonds act as catalysts for covalent bond exchange, while at high concentration, they provide a pervasive vinylogous urea &#8208; urethane (VU) network of strong non&#8208;covalent interactions, giving rise to phase separation and inhibiting polymer chain dynamics. This offers a straightforward design principle for dynamic polymer materials, showing at the same time the possible additive and synergistic effects of supramolecular and dynamic covalent polymer networks.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular&#160;Engineering Enabling High Initial Coulombic Efficiency and Rubost Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Hard Carbon in Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hard carbon (HC) as a potential candidate anode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) suffers from unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE), which limits its commercial applications and urgently requires the emergence of a new strategy. Herein, an organic molecule with two sodium ions, disodium phthalate (DP), was successfully engineered on the HC surface (DP&#8208;HC) to replenish the sodium loss from solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation. A stabilized and ultrathin (~7.4 nm) SEI was constructed on the DP&#8208;HC surface, which proved to be simultaneously suitable in both ester and ether electrolytes. Compared to pure HC (60.8%), the as&#8208;designed DP&#8208;HC exhibited a high ICE of &gt;96.3% in NaPF6 in diglyme (G2) electrolyte, and is capable of servicing consistently for &gt;1600 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8211;1. The Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP)|DP&#8208;HC full&#8208;cell with a 98.7% exceptional ICE can be cycled stably for 450 cycles, demonstrating the tremendous practical application potential of DP&#8208;HC. This work provides a molecular design strategy to improve the ICE of HC, which will inspire more researchers to concentrate on the commercialization progress of HC.</dc:description>

         <title>Confining Bismuth&#8208;halide Perovskite in Mesochannels of Silica Nanomembranes for Exceptional Photocatalytic Abatement of Air Pollutants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spatially confined photocatalysis has emerged as a viable strategy for the intensification of various redox reactions, but the influence of confined structure on reaction behavior is always overlooked in gas&#8208;solid reactions. Herein, we report a nanomembrane with confining Cs3Bi2Br9 nanocrystals inside vertical channels of porous insulated silica&#160;thin sheets (CBB@SBA(&#8869;)) for photocatalytic nitric oxide (NO) abatement. The ordered one&#8208;dimensional (1D) pore channels with mere 70 nm channel length provide a highly accessible confined space for catalytic reactions. A record&#8208;breaking NO&#160;conversion efficiency of 98.2% under a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 3.0&#215;106 mL g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, as well as exceptionally high stability over 14 h and durability over a wide humidity range (RH=15~90%) was realized over SBA(&#8869;) confined Cs3Bi2Br9, well beyond its nonconfined analogue and the Cs3Bi2Br9 confine in Santa Barbara Amorphous (SBA&#8208;15). Mechanism studies suggested that the insulated pore channels of SBA(&#8869;) in CBB@SBA(&#8869;) endow concentrated electron field and enhanced mass transfer that render high exposure of reactive species and lower reaction barrier needs for &#183;O2&#8722; formation and NO oxidation, as well as prevents structural degradation of Cs3Bi2Br9. This work expands an innovative strategy for designing efficient photocatalysts for air pollution remediation.</dc:description>

         <title>Microbubble Biointerfacing by Regulation of the Platelet Membrane Surfactant Activity at the Gas&#8208;Liquid Interface for Acute Thrombosis Targeting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biointerfacing nanomaterials with cell membranes has been successful in the functionalization of nanoparticles or nanovesicles, but microbubble functionalization remains challenging due to the unique conformation of the lipid monolayer structure at the gas&#8208;liquid interface that provides insufficient surfactant activity. Here, we describe a strategy to rationally regulate the surfactant activity of platelet membrane vesicles by adjusting the ratio of proteins to lipids through fusion with synthetic phospholipids (i.e., liposomes). A &#8220;platesome&#8221; with the optimized protein&#8208;to&#8208;lipid ratio can be assembled at the gas&#8208;liquid interface in the same manner as pulmonary surfactants to stabilize a microsized gas bubble. Platesome microbubbles (PMBs) inherited 61.4% of the platelet membrane vesicle proteins and maintained the active conformation of integrin &#945;IIb&#946;3 without the talin&#8208;1 for fibrin binding. We demonstrated that the PMBs had good stability, long circulation, and superior functionality both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, by molecular ultrasound imaging, the PMBs provide up to 11.8 dB of ultrasound signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio enhancement for discriminating between acute and chronic thrombi. This surface tension regulating strategy may provide a paradigm for biointerfacing microbubbles with cell membranes, offering a potential new approach for the construction of molecular ultrasound contrast agents for the diagnosis of different diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Helicoselective Synthesis of Indolohelicenoids via Organocatalytic Central&#8208;to&#8208;Helical Chirality Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a helicoselective and convergent construction of indolohelicenoids with excellent efficiency and stereocontrol. This reaction proceeds through a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyzed enantioselective cycloaddition and eliminative aromatization sequence, which can be finely controlled by adjusting the reaction temperature. Mechanistic studies reveal that the chiral phosphoric acid cooperatively serves as both a bifunctional and Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst, enabling a one&#8208;pot central&#8208;to&#8208;helical chirality conversion. Additionally, the optical properties of the synthesized indolohelicenoids were characterized to explore their potential applications in organic photoelectric materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Polar Perovskites for Highly Sensitive&#160;Self&#8208;Driven X&#8208;Ray&#160;Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs)  have achieved tremendous success in direct X&#8208;ray detection due to their high absorption coefficient and excellent carrier transport. However, owing to the centrosymmetry of classic 3D structures, these reported X&#8208;ray detectors mostly require external electrical fields to run, resulting in bulky overall circuitry, high energy consumption, and operational instability. Herein, we first report the unprecedented radiation photovoltage in 3D OIHP for efficient self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection. Specifically, the 3D polar OIHP MhyPbBr3 (1, Mhy = methylhydrazine) shows an intrinsic radiation photovoltage (0.47 V) and large mobility&#8208;lifetime product (1.1 &#215; 10&#8722;3 cm2 V&#8722;1) under X&#8208;ray irradiation. Strikingly, these excellent physical characteristics endow 1 with sensitive self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection performance, showing a considerable sensitivity of 220 &#956;C Gy&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2, which surpasses those of most self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detectors. This work first explores highly sensitive self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection in 3D polar OIHPs, shedding light on future practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Facilitating the Electrochemical Oxidation of ZnS through Iodide Catalysis for Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;sulfur (Zn&#8208;S) batteries show great potential for unlocking high energy and safety aqueous batteries. Yet, the sluggish kinetic and poor redox reversibility of the sulfur conversion reaction in aqueous solution challenge the development of Zn&#8208;S batteries. Here, we fabricate a high&#8208;performance Zn&#8208;S battery using highly water&#8208;soluble ZnI2 as an effective catalyst. In situ experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the strong interaction between I&#8722; and the ZnS nanoparticles (discharge product) leads to the atomic rearrangement of ZnS, weakening the Zn&#8208;S bonding, and thus facilitating the electrochemical oxidation reaction of ZnS to S. The aqueous Zn&#8208;S battery exhibited a high energy density of 742 Wh kg(sulfur)&#8722;1 at the power density of 210.8 W kg(sulfur)&#8722;1 and good cycling stability over 550 cycles. Our findings provide new insights about the iodide catalytic effect for cathode conversion reaction in Zn&#8208;S batteries, which is conducive to promoting the future development of high&#8208;performance aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Patient&#8208;derived Immunocompetent Tumor Organoids: A Platform for Chemotherapy Evaluation in the Context of T&#8208;cell Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most of the anticancer compounds synthesized by chemists are primarily evaluated for their direct cytotoxic effects at the cellular level, often overlooking the critical role of the immune system. In this study, we developed a patient&#8208;derived, T&#8208;cell&#8208;retaining tumor organoid model that allows us to evaluate the anticancer efficacy of chemical drugs under the synergistic paradigm of antigen&#8208;specific T&#8208;cell&#8208;dependent killing, which may reveal the missed drug hits in the simple cytotoxic assay. We evaluated clinically approved platinum (Pt) drugs and a custom library of twenty&#8208;eight PtIV compounds. We observed low direct cytotoxicity of Pt drugs, but variable synergistic effects in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). In contrast, the majority of PtIV compounds exhibited potent tumor&#8208;killing capabilities. Interestingly, several PtIV&#160;compounds went beyond direct tumor killing and showed significant immunosynergistic effects with ICIs, outstanding at sub&#8208;micromolar concentrations. Among these,&#160;Pt&#8208;19, PtIV compounds with cinnamate axial ligands, emerged as the most therapeutically potent,&#160;demonstrating pronounced immunosynergistic effects by promoting the release of cytotoxic cytokines, activating immune&#8208;related pathways and enhancing T cell receptor (TCR) clonal expansion. Overall, this initiative marks the first use of patient&#8208;derived immunocompetent tumor organoids to explore and study chemotherapy, advancing their path toward more effective small molecule drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Li Deposition by Regulating Structural Connectivity of Electrochemical Li Reservoir in Li&#8208;metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Irregular Li deposition is the major reason for poor reversibility and cycle instability in Li metal batteries, even leading to safety hazards, the causes of which have been extensively explored. The structural disconnection induced by completely dissolving Li in the traditional testing protocol is a key factor accounting for irregular Li growth during the subsequent deposition process. Herein, the critical role played by the structural connectivity of electrochemical Li reservoir in subsequent Li deposition behaviors is elucidated and a morphology&#8208;performance correlation is established. The structural connection and resultant well&#8208;distributed morphology of the in&#8208;situ electrochemical Li reservoir ensure efficient electron transfer and Li+ diffusion pathway, finally leading to homogenized Li nucleation and growth. Tailoring the geometry of Li reservoir can improve the coulombic efficiency and cyclability of anode&#8208;free Li metal batteries by optimizing Li deposition behavior.</dc:description>

         <title>Bidirectional Regulation of Intracellular Enzyme Activity Using Light&#8208;Driven Nano&#8208;Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photochemical regulation provides precise control over enzyme activities with high spatiotemporal resolution. A promising approach involves anchoring "photoswitches" at enzyme active sites to modulate substrate recognition. However, current methods often require genetic mutations and irreversible enzyme modifications for the site&#8208;specific anchoring of "photoswitches", potentially compromising the enzyme activities. Herein, we present a pioneering reversible nano&#8208;inhibitor based on molecular imprinting technique for bidirectional regulation of intracellular enzyme activity. The nano&#8208;inhibitor employs a molecularly imprinted polymer nanoparticle as its body and azobenzene&#8208;modified inhibitors ("photoswitches") as the arms. By using a target enzyme as the molecular template, the nano&#8208;inhibitor acquires oriented binding sites on its surface, resulting in a high affinity for the target enzyme and non&#8208;covalently firm anchoring of the azobenzene&#8208;modified inhibitor to the enzyme active site. Harnessing the reversible isomerization of azobenzene units upon exposure to ultraviolet and visible light, the nano&#8208;inhibitor achieves bidirectional enzyme activity regulation by precisely docking and undocking inhibitor at the active site. Notably, this innovative approach enables the facile in situ regulation of intracellular endogenous enzymes, such as carbonic anhydrase. Our results represent a practical and versatile tool for precise enzyme activity regulation in complex intracellular environments.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stereodivergent engineering of one enzyme into stereocomplementary variants for achieving optically pure molecules with tailor&#8208;made (R)&#8208; or (S)&#8208;configurations on an optional basis is highly desirable and challenging. This study aimed to engineer fatty acid photo&#8208;decarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis (CvFAP) using the focused rational iterative site&#8208;specific mutagenesis (FRISM) strategy to obtain two highly stereocomplementary variants with excellent selectivity (both enantiomeric excess up to 99%). These variants were used for the CvFAP&#8208;catalyzed light&#8208;driven kinetic resolution of oxalates or oxamic acids prepared from the corresponding sec&#8208;alcohols or amines, providing a new biotransformation process for preparing chiral sec&#8208;alcohols or amines. Molecular dynamics simulation, kinetic data and transient spectra revealed the source of selectivity. This study represents the first example of the kinetic resolution of sec&#8208;alcohols or amines catalyzed by a pair of stereocomplementary CvFAPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Harmonizing Enzyme&#8208;like Cofactors to Boost Nanozyme&#160;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineering isolated metal sites resembling the primary coordination sphere of metallocofactors enables atomically dispersed materials as promising nanozymes. However, most existing nanozymes primarily focus on replicating specific metallocofactors while neglecting other supporting cofactors within active pockets, leading to reduced electron transfer (ET) efficiency and thus inferior catalytic performances. Herein, we report a metal&#8208;organic framework UiO&#8208;67 nanozyme with atomically dispersed iron sites, which involves multiple tailored enzyme&#8208;like nanocofactors that synergistically drive the ET process for enhanced peroxidase&#8208;like catalysis. Among them, the linker&#8208;coupled atomic iron site plays a critical role in substrate activation, while bare linkers and zirconia nodes facilitate the ET efficiency of intermediates. The synergy of three nanocofactors results in a 4.29&#8208;fold enhancement compared with the single effort of isolated metal site&#8208;based nanocofactor, holding promise in immunoassay for sensitive detection of chlorpyrifos. This finding opens a new way for designing high&#8208;performance nanozymes by harmonizing various nanocofactors at the atomic and molecular scale.</dc:description>

However, most existing nanozymes primarily focus on replicating specific metallocofactors while neglecting other supporting cofactors within active pockets, leading to reduced electron transfer (ET) efficiency and thus inferior catalytic performances. Herein, we report a metal-organic framework UiO-67 nanozyme with atomically dispersed iron sites, which involves multiple tailored enzyme-like nanocofactors that synergistically drive the ET process for enhanced peroxidase-like catalysis. Among them, the linker-coupled atomic iron site plays a critical role in substrate activation, while bare linkers and zirconia nodes facilitate the ET efficiency of intermediates.
