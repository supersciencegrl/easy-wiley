         <title>Constructing an Acidic Microenvironment by MoS2 in Heterogeneous Fenton Reaction for Pollutant Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have successfully constructed an acidic microenvironment on the surface of CoFe2O4 by chemical bonding MoS2, which ensures the stable circulation of iron ions in the slipping plane and truly overcomes the limitation of pH in pollutant control, thereby expanding the applicability of Fenton technology.







Abstract
Although Fenton or Fenton&#8208;like reactions have been widely used in the environment, biology, life science, and other fields, the sharp decrease in their activity under macroneutral conditions is still a large problem. This study reports a MoS2 cocatalytic heterogeneous Fenton (CoFe2O4/MoS2) system capable of sustainably degrading organic pollutants, such as phenol, in a macroneutral buffer solution. An acidic microenvironment in the slipping plane of CoFe2O4 is successfully constructed by chemically bonding with MoS2. This microenvironment is not affected by the surrounding pH, which ensures the stable circulation of Fe3+/Fe2+ on the surface of CoFe2O4/MoS2 under neutral or even alkaline conditions. Additionally, CoFe2O4/MoS2 always exposes &#8220;fresh&#8221; active sites for the decomposition of H2O2 and the generation of 1O2, effectively inhibiting the production of iron sludge and enhancing the remediation of organic pollutants, even in actual wastewater. This work not only experimentally verifies the existence of an acidic microenvironment on the surface of heterogeneous catalysts for the first time, but also eliminates the pH limitation of the Fenton reaction for pollutant remediation, thereby expanding the applicability of Fenton technology.

         <title>Synthesis of Azaylide&#8208;Based Amphiphiles by the Staudinger Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of new amphiphiles through the Staudinger reaction is reported. These azaylide&#8208;based amphiphiles are stable against hydrolysis even in water and form ca. 2&#8197;nm spherical aggregates through self&#8208;assembly. Furthermore, the obtained amphiphiles are capable of encapsulation of hydrophobic organic dyes in water.







Abstract
Catalyst&#8208; and reagent&#8208;free reactions are powerful tools creating various functional molecules and materials. However, such chemical bonds are usually hydrolysable or require specific functional groups, which limits their use in aqueous media. Herein, we report the development of new amphiphiles through the Staudinger reaction. Simple mixing of chlorinated aryl azide with a hydrophilic moiety and various triarylphosphines (PAr3) gave rise to azaylide&#8208;based amphiphiles NPAr3, rapidly and quantitatively. The obtained NPAr3 formed ca. 2&#8197;nm&#8208;sized spherical aggregates (NPAr3)n in water. The hydrolysis of NPAr3 was significantly suppressed as compared with those of non&#8208;chlorinated amphiphiles nNPAr3. Computational studies revealed that the stability is mainly governed by the decrease in LUMO around the phosphorus atom owing to the o&#8208;substituted halogen groups. Furthermore, hydrophobic dyes such as Nile red and BODIPY were encapsulated by the spherical aggregates (NPAr3)n in water.

         <title>CaMn3IVO4 Cubane Models of the Oxygen&#8208;Evolving Complex: Spin Ground States S&lt;9/2 and the Effect of Oxo Protonation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To better describe the Sn&#8208;state intermediates of Photosystem&#8197;II, a ferromagnetically coupled CaMn3IVO4 subunit with an S=9/2 ground state has been proposed. This assignment has played a key role in the mechanism of water oxidation, but electronic&#8208;structure studies of CaMn3IVO4 complexes remain rare. Through cluster desymmetrization or oxo protonation, lower spin ground states are found to be accessible, challenging prior models.







Abstract
We report the single crystal XRD and MicroED structure, magnetic susceptibility, and EPR data of a series of CaMn3IVO4 and YMn3IVO4 complexes as structural and spectroscopic models of the cuboidal subunit of the oxygen&#8208;evolving complex (OEC). The effect of changes in heterometal identity, cluster geometry, and bridging oxo protonation on the spin&#8208;state structure was investigated. In contrast to previous computational models, we show that the spin ground state of CaMn3IVO4 complexes and variants with protonated oxo moieties need not be S=9/2. Desymmetrization of the pseudo&#8208;C3&#8208;symmetric Ca(Y)Mn3IVO4 core leads to a lower S=5/2 spin ground state. The magnitude of the magnetic exchange coupling is attenuated upon oxo protonation, and an S=3/2 spin ground state is observed in CaMn3IVO3(OH). Our studies complement the observation that the interconversion between the low&#8208;spin and high&#8208;spin forms of the S2 state is pH&#8208;dependent, suggesting that the (de)protonation of bridging or terminal oxygen atoms in the OEC may be connected to spin&#8208;state changes.

         <title>Probing the Paradigm of Promiscuity for N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Complexes and their Protein Adduct Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal complexes can be considered a &#8216;paradigm of promiscuity&#8217; when it comes to their reactions with proteins. They often form adducts with a variety of donor atoms in an unselective manner. We have characterized the adducts formed between a series of isostructural  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes with Ru, Os, Rh, and Ir centers and the model protein hen egg white lysozyme by X&#8208;ray crystallography and mass spectrometry. Distinctive behavior for the metal compounds was observed with the more labile Ru and Rh complexes targeting a surface l&#8208;histidine moiety through cleavage of  p&#8208;  cymene or NHC co&#8208;ligands, respectively. In contrast, the more inert Os and Ir derivatives were detected in an electronegative binding pocket after undergoing ligand exchange of a chlorido ligand for an amino acid side chain. Computational studies supported the binding profiles and hinted at the role of the protein microenvironment for metal complexes eliciting selectivity for specific binding sites on the protein.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly reversible aqueous Zn batteries enabled by zincophilic&#8208;zincophobic interfacial layer and interrupted hydrogen bond electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn batteries promise high energy density but suffer from Zn dendritic growth and poor low&#8208;temperature performance. Here, we overcome both challenges by using an eutectic 7.6 m ZnCl2 aqueous electrolyte with 0.05 m SnCl2 additive, which in&#8208;situ forms a zincophilic/zincophobic Sn/Zn5(OH)8Cl2&#8226;H2O bilayer interphase and enables low temperature operation. Zincophilic Sn decreases Zn plating/stripping overpotential and promotes uniform Zn plating, while zincophobic Zn5(OH)8Cl2&#8226;H2O top&#8208;layer suppresses Zn dendrite growth. The eutectic electrolyte has a high ionic conductivity of ~0.8 mS cm&#8208;1 even at &#8208;70 &#176;C due to the distortion of hydrogen bond network by solvated Zn2+ and Cl&#8208;. The eutectic electrolyte enables Zn||Ti half&#8208;cell a high Coulombic efficiency (CE) of &gt;99.7% for 200 cycles and Zn||Zn cell steady charge/discharge for 500 h with a low overpotential of 8 mV at 3 mA cm&#8208;2. Practically, Zn||VOPO4 batteries maintain &gt;95% capacity with a CE of &gt;99.9% for 200 cycles at &#8208;50 &#176;C, and retain ~30% capacity at &#8208;70 &#176;C of that at 20 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Void Space versus Surface Functionalization for Proton Conduction in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Void space and pore surface functionalization are important structural factors for the design of proton&#8208;conductive MOFs. The priority of these factors was studied systematically, and a MOF with lower porosity and high pore surface functionalization was found to have remarkably high proton conductivity. On the other hand, high porosity proved inefficient in inducing high proton conductivity (see picture).







Abstract
Void space and functionality of the pore surface are important structural factors for proton&#8208;conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) impregnated with conducting media. However, no clear study has compared their priority factors, which need to be considered when designing proton&#8208;conductive MOFs. Herein, we demonstrate the effects of void space and pore&#8208;surface modification on proton conduction in MOFs through the surface&#8208;modified isoreticular MOF&#8208;74(Ni) series [Ni2(dobdc or dobpdc), dobdc=2,5&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate and dobpdc=4,4&#8242;&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;(1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl)&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylate]. The MOF with lower porosity with the same surface functionality showed higher proton conductivity than that with higher porosity despite including a smaller amount of conducting medium. Density functional theory calculations suggest that strong hydrogen bonding between molecules of the conducting medium at high porosity is inefficient in inducing high proton conductivity.

         <title>Discovery of Neuritogenic Securinega Alkaloids from Flueggea suffruticosa by a Building&#8208;Block&#8208;Based Molecular Network Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A combined strategy of building blocks recognition and molecular network construction, termed the building blocks&#8208;based molecular network (BBMN), was first presented to facilitate the&#160;efficient discovery of novel natural products. By mapping the BBMN of the total alkaloid fraction of  Flueggea suffruticosa  , three  Securinega  alkaloids (SEAs) with unusual chemical architectures, suffranidines A&#8211;C (  1  &#8211;  3  ), were discovered and isolated. Compound  1  characterizes an unprecedented 8/5/6/5/6/6/6/6&#8208;fused octacyclic scaffold with a unique cage&#8208;shaped 3&#8208;azatricyclo[6.4.0.0  3,11  ]dodecane core. Compounds  2  and  3  are highly modified SEA dimers that incorporate additional C6 motifs. A hypothetical biosynthetic pathway for  1  &#8211;  3  was proposed. In addition,  1  significantly induced neuronal differentiation and neurite extension by upregulating eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2)&#8208;mediated protein synthesis.</dc:description>

Upon self&#8208;assembly, the chiral V&#8208;shaped conf ormation facilitated a helical hexagonal packing. Notably,  P1  self&#8208;assembled into delicate superhelices with optimum chiroptical activities and the largest  g  abs  for pyrene derivatives to date . T he asymmetric  B  formed two distinct hexagonal aggregates as twists and rectangular nanotubes with greatly amplified CPEE .

         <title>Chiral Mesostructured BiOBr Films with Circularly Polarized Colour Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving &#160; strong and broadband&#160;  circularly polarized colour responses  &#160;in chiral inorganic materials&#160; is &#160;challenging . Here,&#160; we&#160; fabricated&#160;  c hiral mesostructured&#160;  bismuth oxybromide  &#160;(BiOBr) &#160;films&#160; (CMBFs )&#160;  via  &#160;hydrothermal&#160; growth &#160; using&#160; chiral sugar alcohols&#160; as symmetry&#8208; breaking &#160; agents . The layered slabs&#160; of &#160;BiOBr crystals with weak&#160;  van der Waals  &#160;interactions are prone to mismatching due to the chiral driving force, resulting in hierarchically chiral arrangement&#160; of fine size .&#160; Three levels of chirality&#160; exist in the&#160; CMBFs:&#160;  primary &#160;twisting distortion crystal lattices of a nanoflake, secondary helical stacking of nanoflakes to form nanoplates, and&#160;  tertiary  &#160;chiral vortexes arranged by nanoplates. &#160;The CMBFs displayed optical activities (OAs) over a wide wavelength range&#160; of &#160;350&#8208;2500 nm&#160;  with an anisotropic factor&#160;  of&#160; up to 0.99 , &#160; which&#160; led to a significant chirality dependent colour response&#160; to &#160;circularly polarized light. The high selectivity can be considered as the results of enhanced resonance due to structural handedness matching and synergic effect of multi&#8208;OAs.</dc:description>

The layered slabs&#160; of &#160;BiOBr crystals with weak&#160;  van der Waals  &#160;interactions are prone to mismatching due to the chiral driving force, resulting in hierarchically chiral arrangement&#160; of fine size .&#160; Three levels of chirality&#160; exist in the&#160; CMBFs:&#160;  primary &#160;twisting distortion crystal lattices of a nanoflake, secondary helical stacking of nanoflakes to form nanoplates, and&#160;  tertiary  &#160;chiral vortexes arranged by nanoplates. &#160;The CMBFs displayed optical activities (OAs) over a wide wavelength range&#160; of &#160;350-2500 nm&#160;  with an anisotropic factor&#160;  of&#160; up to 0.99 , &#160; which&#160; led to a significant chirality dependent colour response&#160; to &#160;circularly polarized light. The high selectivity can be considered as the results of enhanced resonance due to structural handedness matching and synergic effect of multi-OAs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Highly Strained All&#8208;Phenylene Conjoined Bismacrocycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the precise synthesis of a 3D highly strained all&#8208;phenylene conjoined bismacrocycle (SCPP[10]). Theoretical calculations indicate that this bismacrocycle has a very high strain energy of 110.59&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and the largest interphenylene torsion angle of 46.07&#176;. A 1:2 host&#8211;guest complex of SCPP[10] and PCBM was formed and investigated.







Abstract
Herein, we report the precise synthesis of a 3D highly strained all&#8208;phenylene bismacrocycle, termed conjoined (1,4)[10]cycloparaphenylenophane (SCPP[10]). This structure consists of a twisted benzene ring which is bridged twice by phenylene units anchored in two para&#8208;positions. The conjoined structure of SCPP[10] was confirmed in real space at the atomic scale by scanning tunneling microscopy. Theoretical calculations indicate that this bismacrocycle has a very high strain energy of 110.59&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and the largest interphenylene torsion angle of 46.07&#176; caused by multiple repulsive interactions. Furthermore, a 1:2 host&#8211;guest complex of SCPP[10] and [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester was investigated, which represents the first peanut&#8208;shaped 1:2 host&#8211;guest complex based on bismacrocycles.

         <dc:description>
[o&#8208;C5H4NHOH]2[I7O18(OH)]&#8901;3&#8201;H2O exhibits the first example of [I7O18(OH)]
 branched polyiodate chains and high SHG effect. The asymmetric (o&#8208;C5H4NHOH)+ is in favor of polymerization and inducing the formation of the NCS structure.







Abstract
An organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid polyiodate, namely, [o&#8208;C5H4NHOH]2[I7O18(OH)]&#8901;3&#8201;H2O (I), featuring a novel branched polyiodate chain has been obtained by evaporation method. [o&#8208;C5H4NHOH]2[I7O18(OH)]&#8901;3&#8201;H2O (I) crystalizes in the polar space group Ia and features an [I7O18(OH)]
 branched polyiodate chain in which [I3O9]3&#8722; trimers are grafted on the same side of the one&#8208;dimensional (1D) chain based on [I4O11(OH)]3&#8722; tetramers. The asymmetric organic amine groups are beneficial to the polymerization of iodate groups and inducing the formation of the non&#8208;centrosymmetric (NCS) structure. Compound I exhibits a rather large Second&#8208;Harmonic&#8208; Generation (SHG) signal of 8.5&#215;KH2PO4 (KDP) upon 1064&#8197;nm laser radiation, a moderate band gap of 3.90&#8197;eV and a high laser&#8208;induced&#8208;damage&#8208;threshold (LIDT) of 182.34&#8197;MW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, hence it is a promising new SHG material. The relationship between the structures of the organic amine groups and the overall structures has been also analyzed.

         <title>Li2S6&#8208;Integrated PEO&#8208;Based Polymer Electrolytes for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li2S6 is used as an additive for a PEO&#8208;LiTFSI polymer electrolyte and serves to improve the Li+&#8208;ion conductivity of the electrolyte by reducing the crystalline volume in the PEO as well as aiding in the formation of a thin stable layer that stabilizes the interface with lithium metal. This leads to an impressive electrochemical performance at 40&#8201;&#176;C in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state full cells with a lithium metal anode and an LiFePO4 or LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cathode.







Abstract
The integration of Li2S6 within a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)&#8208;based polymer electrolyte is demonstrated to improve the polymer electrolyte's ionic conductivity because the strong interplay between O2&#8722;(PEO) and Li+ from Li2S6 reduces the crystalline volume within the PEO. The Li/electrolyte interface is stabilized by the in situ formation of an ultra&#8208;thin Li2S/Li2S2 layer via the reaction between Li2S6 and lithium metal, which increases the ionic transport at the interface and suppresses lithium dendrite growth. A symmetric Li/Li cell with the Li2S6&#8208;integrated composite electrolyte has excellent cyclability and a high critical current density of 0.9&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 40&#8201;&#176;C. Impressive electrochemical performance is demonstrated with all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li/LiFePO4 and high&#8208;voltage Li/LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cells at 40&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Robust Molecular Dipole&#8208;Enabled Defect Passivation and Control of Energy&#8208;Level Alignment for High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust route simultaneously allows effective defect passivation and reduced energy difference between the valence band edge of the perovskite and the highest occupied molecular orbital of the hole transport layer (HTL) via the judicious placement of strongly polar molecules at the perovskite/HTL interface.







Abstract
The ability to passivate defects and modulate the interface energy&#8208;level alignment (IEA) is key to boost the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we report a robust route that simultaneously allows defect passivation and reduced energy difference between perovskite and hole transport layer (HTL) via the judicious placement of polar chlorine&#8208;terminated silane molecules at the interface. Density functional theory (DFT) points to effective passivation of the halide vacancies on perovskite surface by the silane chlorine atoms. An integrated experimental and DFT study demonstrates that the dipole layer formed by the silane molecules decreases the perovskite work function, imparting an Ohmic character to the perovskite/HTL contact. The corresponding PSCs manifest a nearly 20&#8201;% increase in power conversion efficiency over pristine devices and a markedly enhanced device stability. As such, the use of polar molecules to passivate defects and tailor the IEA in PSCs presents a promising platform to advance the performance of PSCs.

         <title>Selective Separation of Hexachloroplatinate(IV) Dianions Based on Exo&#8208;Binding with Cucurbit[6]uril</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A instantaneous co&#8208;crystallization protocol relying on the selective recognition of the [PtCl6]2&#8722; dianions by the exo&#8208;binding of cucurbit[6]uril has been demonstrated. This protocol could be exploited to recover platinum from spent vehicular three&#8208;way catalytic converters and other platinum&#8208;bearing metal scrap in a fast, efficient, and highly selective manner.







Abstract
The recognition and separation of anions attracts attention from chemists, materials scientists, and engineers. Employing exo&#8208;binding of artificial macrocycles to selectively recognize anions remains a challenge in supramolecular chemistry. We report the instantaneous co&#8208;crystallization and concomitant co&#8208;precipitation between [PtCl6]2&#8722; dianions and cucurbit[6]uril, which relies on the selective recognition of these dianions through noncovalent bonding interactions on the outer surface of cucurbit[6]uril. The selective [PtCl6]2&#8722; dianion recognition is driven by weak [Pt&#8722;Cl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C] hydrogen bonding and [Pt&#8722;Cl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O] ion&#8211;dipole interactions. The synthetic protocol is highly selective. Recognition is not observed in combinations between cucurbit[6]uril and six other Pt&#8208; and Pd&#8208; or Rh&#8208;based chloride anions. We also demonstrated that cucurbit[6]uril is able to separate selectively [PtCl6]2&#8722; dianions from a mixture of [PtCl6]2&#8722;, [PdCl4]2&#8722;, and [RhCl6]3&#8722; anions. This protocol could be exploited to recover platinum from spent vehicular three&#8208;way catalytic converters and other platinum&#8208;bearing metal waste.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Decarboxylation Coupling Facilitated by Lock&#8208;to&#8208;Unlock Variation of Molecules upon the Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By locking the molecular precursors on the substrate then unlocking them during the reaction, a high&#8208;yield synthesis of a new macrocyclic compound by on&#8208;surface decarboxylation coupling was developed. This work opens up a promising route for improving the practicality of on&#8208;surface synthesis in cases that involve high energy barriers as well as achieving the structural homogeneity, which are major unresolved challenges in this field.







Abstract
On&#8208;surface synthesis (OSS) involving relatively high energy barriers remains challenging due to a typical dilemma: firm molecular anchor is required to prevent molecular desorption upon the reaction, whereas sufficient lateral mobility is crucial for subsequent coupling and assembly. By locking the molecular precursors on the substrate then unlocking them during the reaction, we present a strategy to address this challenge. High&#8208;yield synthesis based on well&#8208;defined decarboxylation, intermediate transition, and hexamerization is demonstrated, resulting in an extended and ordered network exclusively composed of the newly synthesized macrocyclic compound. Thanks to the steric hindrance of its maleimide group, we attain a preferential selection of the coupling. This work unlocks a promising path to enrich the reaction types and improve the coupling selectivity hence the structual homogeneity of the final product for OSS.

         <title>Side&#8208;Chain Engineering for Enhancing the Molecular Rigidity and Photovoltaic Performance of Noncovalently Fused&#8208;Ring Electron Acceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A noncovalently fused&#8208;ring electron acceptor (NFREA) NoCA&#8208;5 containing two terminal side&#8208;chains (T&#8208;SCs) is reported. Introduction of T&#8208;SCs can improve molecular rigidity, which is confirmed by the smaller Stokes shift value and lower reorganization free energy. Combining noncovalent conformational locks and T&#8208;SC engineering, the NoCA&#8208;5&#8208;based device exhibits a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.82&#8201;% and a certified PCE of 14.5&#8201;%.







Abstract
Side&#8208;chain engineering is an effective strategy to regulate the solubility and packing behavior of organic materials. Recently, a unique strategy, so&#8208;called terminal side&#8208;chain (T&#8208;SC) engineering, has attracted much attention in the field of organic solar cells (OSCs), but there is a lack of deep understanding of the mechanism. Herein, a new noncovalently fused&#8208;ring electron acceptor (NFREA) containing two T&#8208;SCs (NoCA&#8208;5) was designed and synthesized. Introduction of T&#8208;SCs can enhance molecular rigidity and intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, which is confirmed by the smaller Stokes shift value, lower reorganization free energy, and shorter &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance in comparison to NoCA&#8208;1. Hence, the NoCA&#8208;5&#8208;based device exhibits a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.82&#8201;% in labs and a certified PCE of 14.5&#8201;%, resulting from a high electron mobility, a short charge&#8208;extraction time, a small Urbach energy (Eu), and a favorable phase separation.

         <title>Visualizing Element Migration over Bifunctional Metal&#8208;Zeolite Catalysts and its Impact on Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic behaviors of bifunctional oxide&#8208;zeolite catalysts for the hydrogenation of CO2 were significantly influenced by element migration, which was dependent on the type of oxides and affected synergy of the two functional components.







Abstract
The catalytic performance of composite catalysts is not only affected by the physicochemical properties of each component, but also the proximity and interaction between them. Herein, we employ four representative oxides (In2O3, ZnO, Cr2O3, and ZrO2) to combine with H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 for the hydrogenation of CO2 to hydrocarbons directed by methanol intermediate and clarify the correlation between metal migration and the catalytic performance. The migration of metals to zeolite driven by the harsh reaction conditions can be visualized by electron microscopy, meanwhile, the change of zeolite acidity is also carefully characterized. The protonic sites of H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 are neutralized by mobile indium and zinc species via a solid ion&#8208;exchange mechanism, resulting in a drastic decrease of C2+ hydrocarbon products over In2O3/H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 and ZnO/H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5. While, the thermomigration ability of chromium and zirconium species is not significant, endowing Cr2O3/H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 and ZrO2/H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 catalysts with high selectivity of C2+ hydrocarbons.

&lt;p&gt;The catalytic performance of composite catalysts is not only affected by the physicochemical properties of each component, but also the proximity and interaction between them. Herein, we employ four representative oxides (In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ZnO, Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to combine with H-ZSM-5 for the hydrogenation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to hydrocarbons directed by methanol intermediate and clarify the correlation between metal migration and the catalytic performance. The migration of metals to zeolite driven by the harsh reaction conditions can be visualized by electron microscopy, meanwhile, the change of zeolite acidity is also carefully characterized. The protonic sites of H-ZSM-5 are neutralized by mobile indium and zinc species via a solid ion-exchange mechanism, resulting in a drastic decrease of C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; hydrocarbon products over In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/H-ZSM-5 and ZnO/H-ZSM-5. While, the thermomigration ability of chromium and zirconium species is not significant, endowing Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/H-ZSM-5 and ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H-ZSM-5 catalysts with high selectivity of C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; hydrocarbons.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Biodegradable Polymersomes with Structure Inherent Fluorescence and Targeting Capacity for Enhanced Photo&#8208;Dynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymersomes with inherent aggregation&#8208;induced emission are presented that have mitochondrial targeting capacity due to the presence of pyridinium groups. The AIEgenic polymersomes, upon encapsulation of photosensitizers, show efficient energy transfer to enable photodynamic therapy, which improves the therapeutic index against cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Biodegradable nanostructures displaying aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) are desirable from a biomedical point of view, due to the advantageous features of loading capacity, emission brightness, and fluorescence stability. Herein, biodegradable polymers comprising poly (ethylene glycol)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(caprolactone&#8208;gradient&#8208;trimethylene carbonate) (PEG&#8208;P(CLgTMC)), with tetraphenylethylene pyridinium&#8208;TMC (PAIE) side chains have been developed, which self&#8208;assembled into well&#8208;defined polymersomes. The resultant AIEgenic polymersomes are intrinsically fluorescent delivery vehicles. The presence of the pyridinium moiety endows the polymersomes with mitochondrial targeting ability, which improves the efficiency of co&#8208;encapsulated photosensitizers and improves therapeutic index against cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. This contribution showcases the ability to engineer AIEgenic polymersomes with structure inherent fluorescence and targeting capacity for enhanced photodynamic therapy.

         <title>Catalytic Generation of Carbanions through Carbonyl Umpolung</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel catalytic strategies for the generation of functionalized carbanioinic species by carbonyl Umpolung are discussed in this Minireview. The application of metal catalysis and photocatalysis significantly facilitates the generation and conversion of carbanionic intermediates starting from carbonyl compounds.







Abstract
Carbonyl Umpolung is a powerful strategy in organic chemistry to construct complex molecules. Over the last few years, versatile catalytic approaches for the generation of acyl anion equivalents from carbonyl compounds have been developed, but methods to obtain alkyl carbanions from carbonyl compounds in a catalytic fashion are still at an early stage. This Minireview summarizes recent progress in the generation of alkyl carbanions through catalytic carbonyl Umpolung. Two different catalytic approaches can be utilized to enable the generation of alkyl carbanions from carbonyl compounds: the catalytic Wolff&#8211;Kishner reaction and the catalytic single&#8208;electron reduction of carbonyl compounds and imines. We discuss the reaction scope, mechanistic insights, and synthetic applications of the methods as well as potential future developments.

         <title>Discovery of Novel Bacterial Chalcone Isomerases by a Sequence&#8208;Structure&#8208;Function&#8208;Evolution Strategy for Enzymatic Synthesis of (S)&#8208;Flavanones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel bacterial chalcone isomerases and their variants identified by a Sequence&#8208;Structure&#8208;Function&#8208;Evolution (SSFE) strategy are able to convert chalcones to flavanones with diverse substrate scopes and strict (S)&#8208;stereopreference enabling a biocatalytic route to (S)&#8208;flavanones.







Abstract
Chalcone isomerase (CHI) is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of flavonoids in plants. The first bacterial CHI (CHIera) was identified from Eubacterium ramulus, but its distribution, evolutionary source, substrate scope, and stereoselectivity are still unclear. Here, we describe the identification of 66 novel bacterial CHIs from Genbank using a novel Sequence&#8208;Structure&#8208;Function&#8208;Evolution (SSFE) strategy. These novel bacterial CHIs show diversity in substrate specificity towards various hydroxylated and methoxylated chalcones. The mutagenesis of CHIera according to the substrate binding models of these novel bacterial CHIs resulted in several variants with greatly improved activity towards these chalcones. Furthermore, the preparative scale conversion catalyzed by bacterial CHIs has been performed for five chalcones and revealed (S)&#8208;selectivity with up to 96&#8201;%&#8197;ee, which provides an alternative biocatalytic route for the synthesis of (S)&#8208;flavanones in high yields.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel MOF film (Cu&#8208;THPP) is prepared and used as the active layer to simulate human memory synapses for the first time. It possesses satisfactory fundamental function of biological synaptic memory. This work demonstrates the tremendous application potential of 2D MOF films in artificial synaptic devices.







Abstract
2D metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) film as the active layer show promising application prospects in various fields including sensors, catalysis, and electronic devices. However, exploring the application of 2D MOF film in the field of artificial synapses has not been implemented yet. In this work, we fabricated a novel 2D MOF film (Cu&#8208;THPP, THPP=5,10,15,20&#8208;Tetrakis(4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)&#8208;21H,23H&#8208;porphine), and further used it as an active layer to explore the application in the simulation of human brain synapses. It shows excellent light&#8208;stimulated synaptic plasticity properties, and exhibits the foundation function of synapses such as long&#8208;term plasticity (LTP), short&#8208;term plasticity (STP), and the conversion of STP to LTP. Most critically, the MOF based artificial synaptic device exhibits an excellent stability in atmosphere. This work opens the door for the application of 2D MOF film in the simulation of human brain synapses.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Methane Oxidation Greatly Promoted by Chlorine Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient CH4 electro&#8208;oxidation system was developed. The electrochemical generation of surface&#8208;adsorbed *Cl intermediates was stabilized by mixed Co&#8211;Ni spinels and allowed to effectively convert CH4 to CH3Cl without over&#8208;oxidation to CO2, with an outstanding yield of CH3Cl and a high selectivity at ambient conditions.







Abstract
Renewable energy&#8208;powered methane (CH4) conversion at ambient conditions is an attractive but highly challenging field. Due to the highly inert character of CH4, the selective cleavage of its first C&#8722;H bond without over&#8208;oxidation is essential for transforming CH4 into value&#8208;added products. In this work, we developed an efficient and selective CH4 conversion approach at room temperature using intermediate chlorine species (*Cl), which were electrochemically generated and stabilized on mixed cobalt&#8211;nickel spinels with different Co/Ni ratios. The lower overpotentials for *Cl formation enabled an effective activation and conversion of CH4 to CH3Cl without over&#8208;oxidation to CO2, and Ni3+ at the octahedral sites in the mixed cobalt&#8211;nickel spinels allowed to stabilize surface&#8208;bound *Cl species. The CoNi2Ox electrocatalyst exhibited an outstanding yield of CH3Cl (364&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and a high CH3Cl/CO2 selectivity of over 400 at room temperature, with demonstrated capability of direct CH4 conversion under seawater working conditions.

         <title>Highly Soluble Supertetrahedra upon Selective Partial Butylation of Chalcogenido Metalate Clusters in Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective access to partially butylated supertetrahedral clusters [Sn10O4S16(SBu)4]4&#8722; was achieved by employing a di&#8208;butylated ionic liquid as reaction medium and alkylation agent. In contrast to purely inorganic [Sn10O4S20]8&#8722;, the butylated analogs are soluble in solvents like CH2Cl2 or CH3CN, without losing the typical opto&#8208;electronic properties. Solution&#8208;NMR data were assigned with the help of newly developed all&#8208;electron relativistic DFT methods.







Abstract
Supertetrahedral clusters have been reported in two generally different types so far: one type possessing an organic ligand shell, no or low charges, and high solubility, while the other cluster type is ligand&#8208;free with usually high charges and low or no solubility in common solvents. The latter is a tremendous disadvantage regarding further use of the clusters in solution. However, as organic substituents usually broaden the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gaps, which cannot be overcompensated by the (limited) cluster sizes, a full organic shielding comes along with drawbacks regarding opto&#8208;electronic properties. We therefore sought to find a way of generating soluble clusters with a minimum number of organic substituents. Here, we present the synthesis and full characterization of two salts of [Sn10O4S16(SBu)4]4&#8722; that are high soluble in CH2Cl2 or CH3CN, which includes first NMR and mass spectra obtained from solutions of such salts with mostly inorganic supertetrahedral clusters. The optical absorption properties of this new class of compounds indicates nearly unaffected band gaps. The synthetic approach and the spectroscopic findings were rationalized and explained by means of high&#8208;level quantum chemical studies.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Stabilized Ultrasmall Gold Nanoclusters in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterogeneous nucleation approach has been developed to stabilize ultrasmall and highly dispersed gold nanoclusters by activated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene moieties in a porous solid&#8208;state matrix. The resultant composite exhibits an activity in photocatalytic CO2 reduction four times higher than control materials without NHC&#8208;ligand stabilization.







Abstract
Ultrafine gold nanoclusters (Au&#8208;NCs) are susceptible to migrate and aggregate, even in the porosity of many crystalline solids. N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are a class of structurally diverse ligands for the stabilization of Au&#8208;NCs in homogeneous chemistry, showing catalytic reactivity in CO2 activation. Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate a heterogeneous nucleation approach to stabilize ultrasmall and highly dispersed gold nanoclusters in an NHC&#8208;functionalized porous matrix. The sizes of gold nanoclusters are tunable from 1.3&#8197;nm to 1.8&#8197;nm based on the interpenetration of the metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) topology. Control experiments using amine or imidazolium&#8208;functionalized MOFs afforded the aggregation of Au species. The resultant Au&#8208;NC@MOF composite exhibits a steady and excellent activity in photocatalytic CO2 reduction, superior to control mixtures without NHC&#8208;ligand stabilization. Mechanistic studies reveal the synergistic catalytic effect of MOFs and Au&#8208;NCs through the MOF&#8208;NHC&#8208;Au covalent&#8208;bonding bridges.

         <title>Capturing Visible Light in Low&#8208;Band&#8208;Gap C4N&#8208;Derived Responsive Bifunctional Air Electrodes for Solar Energy Conversion and Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A narrow&#8208;band&#8208;gap C4N material was explored as a visible&#8208;light&#8208;sensitive (VLS) organic bifunctional oxygen catalyst for application in photocoupled secondary batteries. The C4N&#8208;enabled VLS rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries (RZAB) and all&#8208;polymer polymer&#8208;air batteries (RPAB) exhibited markedly reduced charge voltage together with an increased energy efficiency under visible light.







Abstract
We report facile synthesis of low&#8208;band&#8208;gap mesoporous C4N particles and their use as responsive bifunctional oxygen catalysts for visible&#8208;light&#8208;sensitive (VLS) rechargeable Zn&#8208;air battery (RZAB) and polymer&#8208;air battery (RPAB). Compared to widely studied g&#8208;C3N4, C4N shows a smaller band gap of 1.99&#8197;eV, with a larger photocurrent response, and it can function as visible&#8208;light&#8208;harvesting antenna and bifunctional oxygen reduction/evolution (ORR/OER) catalysts, enabling effective photocoupling to tune oxygen catalysis. The C4N&#8208;enabled VLS&#8208;RZAB displays a low charge voltage of 1.35&#8197;V under visible light, which is below the theoretical RZAB voltage of 1.65&#8197;V, corresponding to a high energy efficiency of 97.78&#8201;%. Pairing a C4N cathode with a polymer anode also endows an VLS&#8208;RPAB with light&#8208;boosted charge performance. It is revealed that the ORR and OER active sites in C4N are separate carbon sites near pyrazine&#8208;nitrogen atoms and photogenerated energetic holes can activate OER for improved reaction kinetics.

         <title>Phosphorus and Arsenic Atom Transfer to Isocyanides to Form &#960;&#8208;Backbonding Cyanophosphide and Cyanoarsenide Titanium Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pnictogen atom transfer from Na(OCE) salts (E=P, As) to a TiII&#8208;bound isocyanide provides entry to phosphorus and arsenic analogues of organic isothiocyanates. The low&#8208;coordinate and highly reducing TiII complex, [(TptBu,Me)TiCl], promotes these reactions by trapping the so&#8208;formed cyanophosphide and cyanoarsenide ligands, which display an unusual &#951;3&#8208;coordination mode due to &#960;&#8208;backbonding.







Abstract
Decarbonylation along with E atom transfer from Na(OCE) (E=P, As) to an isocyanide coordinated to the tetrahedral TiII complex [(TptBu,Me)TiCl], yielded the [(TptBu,Me)Ti(&#951;3&#8208;ECNAd)] species (Ad=1&#8208;adamantyl, TptBu,Me&#8722;=hydrotris(3&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;5&#8208;methylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)borate). In the case of E=P, the cyanophosphide ligand displays nucleophilic reactivity toward Al(CH3)3; moreover, its bent geometry hints to a reduced Ad&#8722;NCP3&#8722; resonance contributor. The analogous and rarer mono&#8208;substituted cyanoarsenide ligand, Ad&#8722;NCAs3&#8722;, shows the same unprecedented coordination mode but with shortening of the N=C bond. As opposed to TiII, VII fails to promote P atom transfer to AdNC, yielding instead [(TptBu,Me)V(OCP)(CNAd)]. Theoretical studies revealed the rare ECNAd moieties to be stabilized by &#960;&#8208;backbonding interactions with the former TiII ion, and their assembly to most likely involve a concerted E atom transfer between Ti&#8208;bound OCE&#8722; to AdNC ligands when studying the reaction coordinate for E=P.

         <title>Bridging Thermal Catalysis and Electrocatalysis: Catalyzing CO2 Conversion with Carbon&#8208;Based Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite similar underlying phenomena, studies that directly analogize between thermal catalysis and electrocatalysis are rare. Here, we employ a Ni, N&#8208;doped carbon catalyst that is thermally stable and electronically conductive to show that high selectivity CO production is observed under both electrochemical CO2 reduction conditions and thermal reverse&#8208;water gas shift environments.







Abstract
Understanding the differences between reactions driven by elevated temperature or electric potential remains challenging, largely due to materials incompatibilities between thermal catalytic and electrocatalytic environments. We show that Ni, N&#8208;doped carbon (NiPACN), an electrocatalyst for the reduction of CO2 to CO (CO2R), can also selectively catalyze thermal CO2 to CO via the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) representing a direct analogy between catalytic phenomena across the two reaction environments. Advanced characterization techniques reveal that NiPACN likely facilitates RWGS on dispersed Ni sites in agreement with CO2R active site studies. Finally, we construct a generalized reaction driving&#8208;force that includes temperature and potential and suggest that NiPACN could facilitate faster kinetics in CO2R relative to RWGS due to lower intrinsic barriers. This report motivates further studies that quantitatively link catalytic phenomena across disparate reaction environments.

         <title>Gated Molecular Diffusion at Liquid&#8211;Liquid Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By taking advantage of host&#8211;guest molecular recognition at the oil&#8208;water interface, photoresponsive interfacial assemblies with jammed nanoparticle surfactants are present. The permeability of the colloidal membrane can be effectively manipulated by switching the nanoparticle surfactants from a jammed state to an unjammed state with a photo trigger, leading to a controlled molecular diffusion and release, affording a versatile platform for the construction of next generation smart interfacial systems.







Abstract
The jamming of nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs) at liquid&#8211;liquid interface imparts attractive properties to the interfacial assemblies and enables the structuring of liquids. Herein, we report photoresponsive supramolecular microcapsules with jammed NPS assemblies at the oil&#8208;water interface, taking advantage of host&#8211;guest molecular recognition. The permeability of the colloidal membrane can be effectively manipulated by switching the NPSs from a jammed state to an unjammed state with a photo trigger, leading to a controlled molecular diffusion and release, affording a versatile platform for the construction of next generation smart microcapsule systems.

         <title>Reducing Defects Density and Enhancing Hole Extraction for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by &#960;&#8208;Pb2+ Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Featuring a fused tricyclic core, an organic small molecule was intentionally synthesized to reduce defects density and improve hole transportation in perovskite devices via &#960;&#8208;Pb2+ interactions, confirmed by multiple characterizations and simulation.







Abstract
Molecular doping is an of significance approach to reduce defects density of perovskite and to improve interfacial charge extraction in perovskite solar cells. Here, we show a new strategy for chemical doping of perovskite via an organic small molecule, which features a fused tricyclic core, showing strong intermolecular &#960;&#8208;Pb2+ interactions with under&#8208;coordinated Pb2+ in perovskite. This &#960;&#8208;Pb2+ interactions could reduce defects density of the perovskite and suppress the nonradiative recombination, which was also confirmed by the density functional theory calculations. In addition, this doping via &#960;&#8208;Pb2+ interactions could deepen the surface potential and downshift the work function of the doped perovskite film, facilitating the hole extraction to hole transport layer. As a result, the doped device showed high efficiency of 21.41&#8201;% with ignorable hysteresis. This strategy of fused tricyclic core&#8208;based doping provides a new perspective for the design of new organic materials to improve the device performance.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding&#8208;Induced Heterogenization of Nickel and Palladium Catalysts for Copolymerization of Ethylene with Polar Monomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternative heterogenization approach that uses hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;induced interactions of a solid support with metal complexes was developed. The resulting heterogeneous nickel and palladium catalysts showed superior properties in ethylene polymerization and copolymerization with great product morphology control.







Abstract
The practical synthesis of polar&#8208;functionalized polyolefins using transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed copolymerization of olefins with polar monomers is a challenge; the use of heterogeneous catalysts is little explored. Herein, we report the synthesis of heterogeneous naphthoquinone&#8208;based nickel (Ni/SiO2) and palladium (Pd/SiO2) catalysts through hydrogen bonding interactions of the ligands with the silica surface. Ni/SiO2 exhibits high activities (up to 2.65&#215;106&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) during the copolymerization of ethylene with 5&#8208;hexene&#8208;1&#8208;yl&#8208;acetate, affording high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (Mn up to 630&#8201;000) polar&#8208;functionalized semicrystalline polyethylene (comonomer incorporation up to 2.8&#8197;mol&#8201;%), along with great morphology control. The resulting copolymers possess improved surface properties and great mechanical properties. Pd/SiO2 can mediate ethylene copolymerization with polar monomers with moderate activity to produce high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight copolymers with tunable comonomer incorporation.

         <title>Be2(BO3)(IO3): The First Anion&#8208;mixed Van der Waals Member in the KBe2BO3F2 Family with a Very Strong Second Harmonic Generation Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Be2(BO3)(IO3) is the first metal borate&#8208;iodate NLO crystal. It is also the first anion&#8208;mixed van der Waals member in the KBe2BO3F2 family with a very strong second harmonic generation response.







Abstract
To obtain new nonlinear optical (NLO) materials with a large second harmonic generation (SHG) effect has always been a great challenge. We have synthesized the first metal borate&#8208;iodate NLO crystal, Be2(BO3)(IO3) (BBIO), by multicomponent modification of KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF), in which the structural features of KBBF were maintained and (IO3)&#8722; groups were connected to honeycomb [Be2BO3O2]&#8734; layers. As the first KBBF family member with mixed anionic groups, BBIO benefited from the synergistic effect of (IO3)&#8722;, (BO3)3&#8722; and (BeO4)6&#8722; groups, and exhibited a very strong SHG response of &#8776;7.2&#215;KH2PO4 (KDP, @1064&#8197;nm) and a large birefringence (&#916;n) of 0.172 at 1064&#8197;nm. BBIO may, unexpectedly, optimize growth habits via van der Waals forces. This study presents borate&#8208;iodate as a new NLO material and it demonstrates opportunities in KBBF structural engineering.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction of Ketimines and Unactivated Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided by computational screening, a highly enantioselective aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;ones with unactivated dienes was realized by using a B(C6F5)3/chiral phosphoric acid catalyst system under mild conditions. The reaction has a broad scope with respect to both aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction partners and offers rapid access to an array of tetrahydropyridine derivatives (up to 99&#8201;% yield, &gt;20:1 dr and 98:2 er).







Abstract
The enantioselective aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction is efficient for constructing chiral tetrahydropyridines, but the catalytic asymmetric aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of ketimines with unactivated dienes is still a challenging topic. Herein, guided by computational screening, a highly enantioselective aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;ones with unactivated dienes was realized by using a B(C6F5)3/chiral phosphoric acid catalyst system under mild conditions. The reaction has a broad scope with respect to both aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction partners and hence offers rapid access to an array of tetrahydropyridine derivatives with pretty outcomes (up to 99&#8201;% yield, &gt;20:1 dr and 98:2 er). The reaction is very efficient: lowering catalyst loadings for the model reaction to 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;%, enantioselectivity is still maintained. The synthetic utility was confirmed by transformations of the products. DFT calculations provide convincing evidence for the interpretation of stereoselection.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Conformer&#8208;Induced Formation of Zirconium&#8211;Organic Framework for Methane Storage and MTO Product Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One topologically unprecedented zirconium&#8211;organic framework was successfully assembled by virtue of a used and semirigid tricarboxylate ligand via ligand&#8208;conformer&#8208;induction. The spe&#8208;MOF exhibits relatively high methane storage capacity and efficient MTO product separation performance due to its integrated features, shedding light on the development of novel zirconium&#8208;based adsorbents by the utilization of semirigid organic linkers aiming advanced applications.







Abstract
In pursuit of novel adsorbents with efficient adsorptive gas storage and separation capabilities remains highly desired and challenging. Although the documented zirconium&#8208;tricarboxylate&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have displayed a variety of topologies encompassing underlying and geometry mismatch ones, the employed organic linkers are exclusively rigid and poorly presenting one type of conformation in the resultant structures. Herein, a used and semirigid tricarboxylate ligand of H3TATAB was judiciously selected to isolate a zirconium&#8208;based spe&#8208;MOF after the preliminary discovery of srl&#8208;MOF. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals that the fully deprotonated TATAB linker in spe&#8208;MOF exhibits two distinct conformers, concomitant with popular Oh and rare S6 symmetrical Zr6 molecular building blocks, generating an unprecedented (3,3,12,12)&#8208;c nondefault topology. Specifically, the spe&#8208;MOF exhibits structurally higher complexity, hierarchical micropores, open metal sites free and rich electronegative groups on the pore surfaces, leading to relatively high methane storage capacity without considering the missing&#8208;linker defects and efficient MTO product separation performance.

         <title>Total Synthesis of the Alleged Structure of Crenarchaeol Enables Structure Revision**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Total synthesis of the proposed structure of crenarchaeol and comparison with the natural isolate has led to a revised structure of crenarchaeol, wherein one of the 22 stereocenters is inverted. The synthesis featured an asymmetric intermolecular Tsuji&#8211;Trost&#8208;type alkylation to access the unusual 5&#8208;6&#8208;ring motif as well as a late stage ring&#8208;closing metathesis to access the 66&#8208;membered macrocycle of crenarchaeol.







Abstract
Crenarchaeol is a glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether lipid produced exclusively in Archaea of the phylum Thaumarchaeota. This membrane&#8208;spanning lipid is undoubtedly the structurally most sophisticated of all known archaeal lipids and an iconic molecule in organic geochemistry. The 66&#8208;membered macrocycle possesses a unique chemical structure featuring 22 mostly remote stereocenters, and a cyclohexane ring connected by a single bond to a cyclopentane ring. Herein we report the first total synthesis of the proposed structure of crenarchaeol. Comparison with natural crenarchaeol allowed us to propose a revised structure of crenarchaeol, wherein one of the 22 stereocenters is inverted.

         <title>Photo&#8208;driven Oxygen Vacancies Extends Charge Carrier Lifetime for Efficient Solar Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocharging/discharging strategy is used to initiate the WO3 electrode and prolong charge carrier lifetime for the oxygen evolution reaction. A WO3/CuO photoanode exhibited an outstanding photocurrent with a low onset potential. The prolonged charge carrier lifetime of photocharged WO3 and the electronic systems of photocharged WO3/CuO semiconductors were clarified using the nonadiabatic molecular dynamics combined with time&#8208;domain DFT.







Abstract
A photocharge/discharge strategy is proposed to initiate the WO3 photoelectrode and suppress the main charge recombination, which remarkably improves the photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance. The photocharged WO3 surrounded by a 8&#8211;10&#8197;nm overlayer and oxygen vacancies could be operated more than 25&#8197;cycles with 50&#8197;h durability without significant decay on PEC activity. A photocharged WO3/CuO photoanode exhibits an outstanding photocurrent of 3.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;VRHE with a low onset potential of 0.6&#8197;VRHE, which is one of the best performances of p&#8208;n heterojunction structure. Using nonadiabatic molecular dynamics combined with time&#8208;domain DFT, we clarify the prolonged charge carrier lifetime of photocharged WO3, as well as how electronic systems of photocharged WO3/CuO semiconductors enable the effective photoinduced electrons transfer from WO3 into CuO. This work provides a feasible route to address excessive defects existed in photoelectrodes without causing extra recombination.

         <title>Facet Selectivity Guided Assembly of Nanoarchitectures onto Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facet&#8208;selective nanostructure was constructed by assembly of anisotropic upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) with two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2DMOFs) nanosheets. The UCNPs/2DMOFs nanostructures possess facet selectivity and they display specific optical properties that are advantageous in anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology.







Abstract
Facet&#8208;selective nanostructures in living systems usually exhibit outstanding optical and enzymatic properties, playing important roles in photonics, matter exchange, and biocatalysis. Bioinspired construction of facet&#8208;selective nanostructures offers great opportunities for sophisticated nanomaterials, but remains a formidable task. We have developed a macromolecule&#8208;mediated strategy for the assembly of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs)/two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2DMOFs) heterostructures with facet selectivity. Both experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) can be utilized as an interface&#8208;selective mediator to further promote the facet&#8208;selective assembly of MOFs onto the surface of UCNPs. The UCNPs/2DMOFs nanostructures with facet selectivity display specific optical properties and show great advantages in anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Our demonstration of UCNPs/2DMOFs provides a vivid example for the controlled fabrication of facet&#8208;selective nanostructures and can promote the development of advanced functional materials for applications in biosensing, energy conversion, and information assurance.

Our demonstration of UCNPs/2DMOFs provides a vivid example for the controlled fabrication of facet-selective nanostructures and can promote the development of advanced functional materials for applications in biosensing, energy conversion, and information assurance.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation&#8208;Based Construction of Axially and Centrally Chiral Indenes through Two Discrete Insertions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation of nitrones and coupling with different classes of sterically hindered alkynes afforded C&#8722;C or C&#8722;N atropochiral and C&#8208;centered point&#8208;chiral indenes in excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. The chiral center and axis are disposed in a distal fashion, and they are constructed via two uncorrelated stereo&#8208;determining steps.







Abstract
Reported herein is asymmetric [3+2] annulation of arylnitrones with different classes of alkynes catalyzed by chiral rhodium(III) complexes, with the nitrone acting as an electrophilic directing group. Three classes of chiral indenes/indenones have been effectively constructed, depending on the nature of the substrates. The coupling system features mild reaction conditions, excellent enantioselectivity, and high atom&#8208;economy. In particular, the coupling of N&#8208;benzylnitrones and different classes of sterically hindered alkynes afforded C&#8722;C or C&#8722;N atropochiral pentatomic biaryls with a C&#8208;centered point&#8208;chirality in excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity (45 examples, average 95.6&#8201;% ee). These chiral center and axis are disposed in a distal fashion and they are constructed via two distinct migratory insertions that are stereo&#8208;determining and are under catalyst control.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An iridium&#8208;catalyzed reductive three&#8208;component coupling reaction for the synthesis of medicinally relevant &#945;&#8208;amino 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazoles from abundant tertiary amides or lactams, carboxylic acids, and (N&#8208;isocyanimino) triphenylphosphorane, is described. Proceeding under mild conditions using (&lt;1 mol%) Vaska&#8217;s complex (IrCl(CO)(PPh3)2) and tetramethyldisiloxane to access the key reactive iminium ion intermediates, a broad range of structurally complex &#945;&#8208;amino 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole architectures were efficiently accessed from diverse carboxylic acid feedstock coupling partners. Extension to &#945;&#8208;amino heterodiazole synthesis was readily achieved by exchanging the carboxylic acid coupling partner for C&#8208;, S&#8208;, or N&#8208;centered Br&#248;nsted acids, and provided rapid and modular access to these desirable, yet difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access, heterocycles. Furthermore, the high chemoselectivity of the catalytic reductive activation step allowed the late&#8208;stage functionalization of 10 drug molecules, including the synthesis of novel heterodiazole&#8208;fused drug&#8208;drug conjugates.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective C&#8722;F Bond Allylation of Trifluoromethylalkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective C&#8722;F bond functionalization of CF3  group represents an appealing strategy for the incorporation of pharmaceutically privileged difluoromethylene moiety. Despite the recent significant advancement attained in the functionalization of Ar&#8208;CF3  molecules, prescriptions amenable for alkenyl&#8208;CF3  congeners remain sufficiently inadequate. Herein, we report a strategically novel protocol for the C&#8722;F bond elaboration of trifluoromethylalkene derivatives. By using readily available allyl metallics as nucleophilic coupling partner, the present reaction enables an expedient construction of structurally diversified CF2  &#8208;bridged 1,5&#8208;dienes. Furthermore, the exquisite selectivity observed in this transformation is revealed to be based on the underlying mechanism that consists of a cascade of nucleophilic SN2'&#160;defluorinative allylation and electronically promoted Cope rearrangement.</dc:description>

         <title>Applying Machine Learning in Rechargeable Batteries from Microscale to Macroscale</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Emerging machine learning (ML) methodologies are widely applied in chemistry and materials science studies and are constructing a data&#8208;driven research paradigm. This review summarizes the applications of ML in rechargeable batteries from microscale to macroscale. Specifically, ML affords an emerging strategy to explore new functional for density functional theory calculations and new potentials for molecular dynamics simulations, which are expected to significantly enhance the challenging description concerning with interfaces or amorphous structures. Besides, ML possesses great potential to mine and unveil valuable information from both experimental and theoretical datasets. A quantitative &#8220;structure&#8211;function&#8221; correlation can thusly be established, the application of which includes predicting ionic conductivity of solids as well as forecasting battery lifespan. ML also exhibits great advantages in strategy optimization, such as fast&#8208;charge protocols. Lastly, an outlook on the future combination of multi&#8208;scale simulations, experiments, and ML is provided and the role of human in the data&#8208;driven research paradigm is highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>Green Conversion of CO2 and Propargylamines Triggered by Triply Synergistic Catalytic Effect in MOFs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclization of propargylamines with CO2 to obtain 2&#8208;oxazolidone heterocyclic compounds is an essential reaction in industry, but it is usually catalyzed by noble&#8208;metal catalysts with organic bases as co&#8208;catalyst under harsh conditions. Herein a unique Cu(I)/Cu(II) mixed valence copper&#8208;based framework {[(CuI6I5)Cu3IIL6(DMA)3](NO3)&#183;9DMA}n (1) with good solvent and thermal stability was synthesized, and high density of uncoordinated amino groups are evenly distributed in the large nanoscopic channels. Catalytic explorations show that 1 can effectively catalyze the reaction of propargylamines with CO2, and the yield can reach 99%. The turnover frequency (TOF) reaches a record value of 230 h&#8208;1, which is much higher than the reported noble&#8208;metal catalysts. Importantly, this is the first case that heterogeneous catalyst can catalyze the green conversion of propargylamines with CO2 without solvents and co&#8208;catalysts under low temperature and atmospheric pressure. The mechanism study shows that the triply synergistic catalytic effect among Cu(I)/Cu(II) and uncoordinated amino groups promote the high efficiency of the reaction and come true the green conversion of CO2. Furthermore, 1 also can directly catalyze this reaction with high efficiency when using the simulated flue gas as CO2 source. This work can inspire the design of more efficient catalysts in the green conversion of CO2.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solution phase room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from organic phosphors is seldom realized. Herein we report one of the highest quantum yield solution state RTP (~41.8 %) in water, from a structurally simple phthalimide phosphor, by employing an organic&#8208;inorganic supramolecular scaffolding strategy. We further use these supramolecular hybrid phosphors as a light&#8208;harvesting scaffold to achieve delayed fluorescence from orthogonally anchored Sulforhodamine acceptor dyes via an efficient triplet to singlet F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (TS&#8208;FRET), which is rarely achieved in solution. Electrostatic cross&#8208;linking of the inorganic scaffold at higher concentrations further facilitates the formation of self&#8208;standing hydrogels with efficient RTP and energy&#8208;transfer mediated long&#8208;lived fluorescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Few&#8208;unit&#8208;cell MFI zeolite synthesized using a simple di&#8208;quaternary ammonium structure&#8208;directing agent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of a pentasil&#8208;type zeolite with ultra&#8208;small few&#8208;unit&#8208;cell crystalline domains, which we call FDP (few&#8208;unit&#8208;cell crystalline domain pentasil), is reported. FDP is made using bis&#8208;1,5(tributyl ammonium) pentamethylene cations as structure directing agent (SDA). This di&#8208;quaternary ammonium SDA combines (i) butyl ammonium, in place of the commonly used, for MFI synthesis, propyl ammonium, and (ii) a five&#8208;carbon nitrogen&#8208;connecting chain, in place of the six&#8208;carbon connecting chain SDAs that are known to fit well within the MFI pores. Although each modification, singularly implemented, is known to hinder nucleation and growth rates of MFI, they have not been, hitherto, combined to synergistically act on MFI morphology. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and electron microscopy imaging of FDP indicate ca. 10 nm crystalline domains organized in hierarchical micro&#8208;/meso&#8208;porous aggregates exhibiting mesoscopic order with an aggregate particle size that can be up to ca. 4 &#956;m. The synthesis of FDP is attributed to conflicting crystal shaping trends attributed to distinct moieties being incorporated in a single SDA. Specifically, the pentamethylene moiety is known to favor early crystal growth along the b&#8208;axis, while the butyl moieties are known to hinder growth along the b&#8208;axis. We attribute the obtained ultrasmall crystalline domains to the conflicting trends of the frustrated SDA. It is demonstrated that Al and Sn can be incorporated into the FDP zeolite framework to produce active and selective methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbon and glucose isomerization catalysts, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Programming of Supramolecular Assemblies in Living Cell for Selective Cancer Cell Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report on the design, synthesis, and assembly of an enzymatic programmable peptide system inspired by endocytic processes to induce molecular assemblies formation spatiotemporally in living cancer cells, resulting in glioblastoma cell death mainly in necroptosis. Our results indicate the stability and glycosylation of molecules play an essential role in determining the final bioactivity. Detailed mechanistic studies by CLSM, Flow cytometry, Western blot, and Bio&#8208;EM suggest the site&#8208;specific formation of assemblies, which could induce the LMP and activate the downstream cell death pathway. Moreover, we also demonstrate that our strategy can boost the activity of commercial chemotherapy drug by escaping lysosome sequestration. We expected this work would be expanded towards artificial intelligent biomaterials for cancer therapy and imaging precisely.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoresponsive Supramolecular Polypseudorotaxanes with Infinite Switching Capability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemoresponsive supramolecular systems with infinite switching capability are important for applications in recycled materials and intelligent devices. To attain this objective, here a chemoresponsive polypseudorotaxane is reported on the basis of a bis(  p  &#8208;phenylene)&#8211;34&#8211;crown&#8211;10 macrocycle (  H  ) and a cyano&#8208;substituted viologen guest (  G  ).  H  and  G  form a [2]pseudorotaxane (  H  &#8835;  G  ) both in solution and in the solid state. Upon addition of AgSF  6  , a polypseudorotaxane (denoted as [  H&#183;G&#183;  Ag]  n  ) forms as synergistically driven by host&#8211;guest complexation and metal&#8208;coordination interactions. [  H&#183;G&#183;  Ag]  n  depolymerizes into a [3]pseudorotaxane (denoted as  H  2  &#183;G&#183;  Ag  2  &#183;  acetone  2  ) upon addition of  H  and AgSF  6  , while it reforms with successive addition of  G  . The transformations between [  H&#183;G&#183;  Ag]  n  and  H  2  &#183;G&#183;  Ag  2  &#183;  acetone  2  can be switched for infinite cycles, superior to the conventional chemoresponsive supramolecular polymeric systems with limited switching capability. Therefore, by taking advantage of the adaptive macrocycle/guest complexation characters, the current study opens up new avenues toward precision engineering of chemoresponsive supramolecular polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling Polymer Molecular Weight Distribution through a Latent Mediator Strategy with Temporal Programming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer molecular weight distribution (MWD) is a key parameter of polymers. Here we present a robust method for controlling polymer MWD in controlled cationic polymerizations. A latent mediator strategy was designed and combined with temporal programming to regenerate mediators at different times during polymerization. Both the breadths and shapes of MWD curves were tuned easily by adjusting an external light source. Bimodal, trimodal and tetramodal distributions were obtained, and the breadths could be varied from 1.06 to 2.09. Polymers with different MWDs prepared by this method had good chain end fidelity, which was demonstrated with successful chain&#8208;extension experiments. In addition, the introduction of temporal programming with a computer&#8208;controlled single chip for the light source opened an avenue for the use of artificial intelligence in polymer synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective C&#8722;C Cleavage of Benzocyclobutenones Enabled by a Blocking Strategy via Ni Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C activation remains a great challenge. The transformations of benzocyclobutenones (BCBs) usually involve the cleavage of C1&#8722;C2 bond. In this work, an unprecedented highly selective cleavage of C1&#8722;C8 bond with the insertion of alkynes is achieved by using blocking strategy via Ni catalysis, providing an efficient method for synthesis of 1,8&#8208;disubstituted naphthalenes. Notably, the blocking group could be readily removed after the transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Doubly Decorated Platinum&#8211;Gallium Intermetallics as Stable Catalysts for Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a promising chemical process that can satisfy the increasing global demand for propylene. However, the Pt&#8208;based catalysts that have been reported thus far are typically deactivated at &#8805;600&#176;C by side reactions and coke formation. Thus, such catalysts possess an insufficient life. Herein, we report a novel catalyst design concept, namely, the double decoration of PtGa intermetallics by Pb and Ca, which synergize the geometric and electronic promotion effects on the catalyst stability, respectively. Pb is deposited on the three&#8208;fold Pt  3  sites of the PtGa nanoparticles to block them, whereas Ca, which affords an electron&#8208;enriched single&#8208;atom&#8208;like Pt  1  site, is placed around the nanoparticles. Thus, PtGa&#8211;Ca&#8211;Pb/SiO  2  exhibits an outstandingly high catalytic stability, even at 600&#176;C (  k  d  = 0.00033 h  &#8722;1  ,  &#964;  = 3067 h), and almost no deactivation of the catalyst was observed for up to 1 month for the first time.</dc:description>

         <title>Automated Crystal Structure Determination Has its Pitfalls: Correction to the Crystal Structures of Iodine Azide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the previous crystal structure determinations of both modifications of iodine azide half of the X&#8208;ray reflections were missed, resulting in incorrect unit cells, incorrect space groups, and unsatisfactory structural models. Using the old data, but including the missed weak reflections, sensible structures were determined. It pays off to take a skilled look at the primary X&#8208;ray data and not to rely solely on computer generated models.







Abstract
Previously published crystal structure determinations of two modifications of iodine azide (IN3) are corrected. In the original determinations, the very weak X&#8208;ray reflections with odd k&#8197;Miller indices had been discarded, resulting in too small unit cells and models with misordered, partly occupied atomic positions.

     alt="Automated Crystal Structure Determination Has its Pitfalls: Correction to the Crystal Structures of Iodine Azide"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the previous crystal structure determinations of both modifications of iodine azide half of the X-ray reflections were missed, resulting in incorrect unit cells, incorrect space groups, and unsatisfactory structural models. Using the old data, but including the missed weak reflections, sensible structures were determined. It pays off to take a skilled look at the primary X-ray data and not to rely solely on computer generated models.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously published crystal structure determinations of two modifications of iodine azide (IN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) are corrected. In the original determinations, the very weak X-ray reflections with odd k&#8197;Miller indices had been discarded, resulting in too small unit cells and models with misordered, partly occupied atomic positions. Using the original diffraction data, refinements with the correct unit cells yield structures of polymeric (&#8722;I&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; chains that are interlocked to layers. A skilled look at the primary X-ray data is always recommended to overcome the lack of crystallographic expertise of computers at automated structure determinations.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Chemo&#8208; and Enantioselective Insertion of Furyl Carbene into the N&#8722;H Bond of 2&#8208;Pyridones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8208;pyridoneasymmetric catalysiscarbeneinsertionproton transferA chemo&#8208; and enantioselective formal N&#8722;H insertion has been accomplished for the first time by using enynones as the donor&#8211;donor carbene precursors. Distinct with the selective O&#8722;H insertion of pyridones for diazo compounds, this reaction occurs exclusively on the desired nitrogen atom. DFT calculations indicate an unprecedented enantioselective O&#8208;to&#8208;C 1,4&#8208;proton transfer.







Abstract
Asymmetric carbene insertion reactions represent one of the most important protocols to construct carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds. The use of donor&#8211;acceptor diazo compounds bearing an ester group is however a prerequisite for achieving high enantioselectivity. Herein, we report a chemo&#8208; and enantioselective formal N&#8722;H insertion of 2&#8208;pyridones that has been accomplished for the first time with enynones as the donor&#8211;donor carbene precursors. DFT calculations indicate an unprecedented enantioselective 1,4&#8208;proton transfer from O to C. The rhodium catalyst provides a chiral pocket in which the steric repulsion and the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction of the propeller ligand play a critical role in determining the selectivities.

         <dc:description>&#8220;Water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; (WIS) electrolytes using super&#8208;concentrated organic lithium (Li) salts are attracting tremendous interest for high energy aqueous Li&#8208;ion batteries, owing to their wide electrochemical stability window that enables the application of high&#8208;energy electrode couples. However, the high salt cost, high viscosity, poor wettability and environmental hazards remain a great challenge. Herein, we present a &#8220;localized water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; (LWIS) electrolyte based on low&#8208;cost lithium nitrate (LiNO  3  ) salt and 1,5&#8208;pentanediol (PD) as inert diluent. The addition of PD not only maintains the solvation structure of the WIS electrolyte and improves the electrolyte stability via hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions with water and NO  3  &#8208;  molecules, but also dramatically reduces the total salt concentration. Furthermore, by in&#8208;situ gelling the LWIS electrolyte with tetraethylene glycol diacrylate (TEGDA) monomer, the electrolyte stability window can be further expanded to 3.0 V. The as&#8208;developed Mo  6  S  8  |LWIS gel electrolyte|LiMn  2  O  4  (LMO) batteries delivered outstanding cycling performance with a Coulombic efficiency of 98.53 % at after 250 cycles at 1 C.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimal Pore Chemistry in an Ultramicroporous Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Benchmark Inverse CO2/C2H2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A charge&#8208; or electron&#8208;transfer strategy within confined pore space is reported for the design of CO2&#8208;selective ultramicroporous metal&#8211;organic frameworks with specific pore environments. Using this strategy, high CO2 capacities and high&#8208;purity C2H2 (&gt; 99.9%) were obtained as proven by fixed bed breakthrough experiments.







Abstract
Isolation of CO2 from acetylene (C2H2) via CO2&#8208;selective sorbents is an energy&#8208;efficient technology for C2H2 purification, but a strategic challenge due to their similar physicochemical properties. There is still no specific methodology for constructing sorbents that preferentially trap CO2 over C2H2. We report an effective strategy to construct optimal pore chemistry in a CeIV&#8208;based ultramicroporous metal&#8211;organic framework CeIV&#8208;MIL&#8208;140&#8208;4F, based on charge&#8208;transfer effects, for efficient inverse CO2/C2H2 separation. The ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal cluster charge transfer is facilitated by CeIV with low&#8208;lying unoccupied 4f orbitals and electron&#8208;withdrawing F atoms functionalized tetrafluoroterephthalate, affording a perfect pore environment to match CO2. The exceptional CO2 uptake (151.7&#8197;cm3&#8201;cm&#8722;3) along with remarkable separation selectivities (above 40) set a new benchmark for inverse CO2/C2H2 separation, which is verified via simulated and experimental breakthrough experiments. The unique CO2 recognition mechanism is further unveiled by in&#8197;situ powder X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments, Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy measurements, and molecular calculations.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Responsive Gene Delivery from Perfluorocarbon Nanoemulsions through Cleavable Poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A disulfide&#8208;linked poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) surfactant allows for stabilization of perfluorocarbon&#8208;in&#8208;water nanoemulsions. Upon reduction, the surfactant is cleaved, triggering destabilization and subsequent release of the encapsulated payload. Stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior is achieved selectively in high concentrations of reducing agent, allowing for delivery of fluorous&#8208;tagged plasmid DNA encoding for enhanced green fluorescent protein.







Abstract
The clinical utility of emulsions as delivery vehicles is hindered by a dependence on passive release. Stimuli&#8208;responsive emulsions overcome this limitation but rely on external triggers or are composed of nanoparticle&#8208;stabilized droplets that preclude sizes necessary for biomedical applications. Here, we employ cleavable poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) diblock copolymer surfactants to form perfluorocarbon (PFC) nanoemulsions that release cargo upon exposure to glutathione. These surfactants allow for the first example of redox&#8208;responsive nanoemulsions in&#8197;cellulo. A noncovalent fluorous tagging strategy is leveraged to solubilize a GFP plasmid inside the PFC nanoemulsions, whereupon protein expression is achieved selectively when employing a stimuli&#8208;responsive surfactant. This work contributes a methodology for non&#8208;viral gene delivery and represents a general approach to nanoemulsions that respond to endogenous stimuli.

         <title>Coordination Polymer Glasses with Lava and Healing Ability for High&#8208;Performance Gas Sieving</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four coordination polymers with good flowability at low vitrification temperature were developed and fabricated into high&#8208;performance gas separation membranes by hot&#8208;casting or hot&#8208;pressing methods. The obtained membranes show excellent H2 sieving ability, rivaling against the best&#8208;reported gas separation membranes. The cracks and functions of the broken membranes can be easily healed upon heating.







Abstract
Coordination polymer (CP) glasses offer a way to tackle the fabrication challenges encountered by inorganic porous membranes and show great potentials for size&#8208;exclusive gas separation. However, their processability and performance still cannot simultaneously meet the requirements for high&#8208;performance membrane separation. Herein, we have developed a series of CP glasses (M&#8208;P&#8208;dmbIm, M=Zn, Cd, Cu, and Mn), which possess low vitrification temperature as well as low viscosity (&#951;) and lave capability above the transition temperatures. The derived glass (agM&#8208;P&#8208;dmbIm) membranes show outstanding performances for H2/CO2, H2/N2, and H2/CH4 separation, which all far surpass the Robeson upper bound and even rival against the best of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art gas separation membranes.

     alt="Coordination Polymer Glasses with Lava and Healing Ability for High-Performance Gas Sieving"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four coordination polymers with good flowability at low vitrification temperature were developed and fabricated into high-performance gas separation membranes by hot-casting or hot-pressing methods. The obtained membranes show excellent H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sieving ability, rivaling against the best-reported gas separation membranes. The cracks and functions of the broken membranes can be easily healed upon heating.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coordination polymer (CP) glasses offer a way to tackle the fabrication challenges encountered by inorganic porous membranes and show great potentials for size-exclusive gas separation. However, their processability and performance still cannot simultaneously meet the requirements for high-performance membrane separation. Herein, we have developed a series of CP glasses (M-P-dmbIm, M=Zn, Cd, Cu, and Mn), which possess low vitrification temperature as well as low viscosity (&#951;) and lave capability above the transition temperatures. The derived glass (a&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;M-P-dmbIm) membranes show outstanding performances for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; separation, which all far surpass the Robeson upper bound and even rival against the best of the state-of-the-art gas separation membranes. The low viscosities not only allow us to hot-cast or hot-press the CP glasses into thin membranes within 5&#8197;min without sacrificing their selectivity and permeability, but also endow the resulted glass membranes with healing ability.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Thiols Act as Methyl Traps in the Biocatalytic Demethylation of Guaiacol Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient demethylation of methyl phenyl ethers was achieved by biocatalytic O2&#8208;free methyl transfer to thiols forming thio ethers. Since the methyl group is not cleaved from the sulfur under these conditions, the thiol compound acts like a trap driving the reaction towards completion.







Abstract
Demethylating methyl phenyl ethers is challenging, especially when the products are catechol derivatives prone to follow&#8208;up reactions. For biocatalytic demethylation, monooxygenases have previously been described requiring molecular oxygen which may cause oxidative side reactions. Here we show that such compounds can be demethylated anaerobically by using cobalamin&#8208;dependent methyltransferases exploiting thiols like ethyl 3&#8208;mercaptopropionate as a methyl trap. Using just two equivalents of this reagent, a broad spectrum of substituted guaiacol derivatives were demethylated, with conversions mostly above 90&#8201;%. This strategy was used to prepare the highly valuable antioxidant hydroxytyrosol on a one&#8208;gram scale in 97&#8201;% isolated yield.

         <title>Infrared Based Saliva Screening Test for COVID&#8208;19</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a modified infrared reflection accessory designed for high throughput saliva analysis we show proof of concept of a COVID&#8208;19 point&#8208;of&#8208;care screening device.







Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) has resulted in an unprecedented need for diagnostic testing that is critical in controlling the spread of COVID&#8208;19. We propose a portable infrared spectrometer with purpose&#8208;built transflection accessory for rapid point&#8208;of&#8208;care detection of COVID&#8208;19 markers in saliva. Initially, purified virion particles were characterized with Raman spectroscopy, synchrotron infrared (IR) and AFM&#8208;IR. A data set comprising 171 transflection infrared spectra from 29 subjects testing positive for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 by RT&#8208;qPCR and 28 testing negative, was modeled using Monte Carlo Double Cross Validation with 50 randomized test and model sets. The testing sensitivity was 93&#8201;% (27/29) with a specificity of 82&#8201;% (23/28) that included positive samples on the limit of detection for RT&#8208;qPCR. Herein, we demonstrate a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept high throughput infrared COVID&#8208;19 test that is rapid, inexpensive, portable and utilizes sample self&#8208;collection thus minimizing the risk to healthcare workers and ideally suited to mass screening.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Diastereodivergent Sequential Catalysis Featuring Two Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two chiral transition&#8208;metal catalysts are combined in one pot to perform orthogonal asymmetric transformations. Simple allyl enol carbonates are converted to ketones bearing two non&#8208;contiguous stereogenic centers via a Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation followed by a Rh&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Hayashi&#8211;Miyaura conjugate addition. This sequential catalysis process is enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent and exhibits statistical amplification of enantiomeric excess.







Abstract
This study demonstrates the feasibility and inherent benefits of combining two distinct asymmetric transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions in one pot. The reported transformation features a Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation and a Rh&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition, effectively converting simple allyl enol carbonate precursors into enantioenriched cyclic ketones with two remote stereocenters. Despite the anticipated challenges associated with controlling stereoselectivity in such a complex system, the products are obtained in enantiomeric excesses ranging up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee, exceeding those obtained from either of the individual asymmetric reactions. In addition, since the stereoselectivity of both steps is under catalyst control, this one&#8208;pot reaction is enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent, enabling facile access to all stereoisomers from the same set of starting materials.

         <title>Precise Identification and Characterization of Catalytically Active Sites on the Surface of &#947;&#8208;Alumina**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#947;&#8208;Alumina is one of the oldest and largest&#8208;scale commercial catalytic materials, but the precise identification of its catalytically active sites has remained elusive. With the aid of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art FTIR, high&#8208;field solid state NMR, and HRTEM techniques, clarification of the nature of the active sites on the surface of &#947;&#8208;alumina is proposed.







Abstract
&#947;&#8208;alumina is one of the oldest and most important commercial catalytic materials with high surface area and stability. These attributes enabled its use as the first commercial large&#8208;scale heterogeneous catalyst for ethanol dehydration. Despite progress in materials characterization the nature of the specific sites on the surface of &#947;&#8208;alumina that are responsible for its unique catalytic properties has remained obscure and controversial. By using combined infrared spectroscopy, electron microscopy and solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance measurements we identify the octahedral, amphoteric (O)5Al(VI)&#8208;OH sites on the (100) segments of massively restructured (110) facets on typical rhombus&#8208;platelet &#947;&#8208;alumina as well as the (100) segments of irrational surfaces (invariably always present in all &#947;&#8208;alumina samples) responsible for its unique catalytic activity. Such (O)5Al(VI)&#8208;OH sites are also present on the macroscopically defined (100) facets of &#947;&#8208;alumina with elongated/rod&#8208;like geometry. The mechanism by which these sites lose &#8208;OH groups upon thermal dehydroxylation resulting in coordinatively unsaturated penta&#8208;coordinate Al+3O5 sites is clarified. These coordinatively unsaturated penta&#8208;coordinate Al sites produce well&#8208;defined thermally stable Al&#8208;carbonyl complexes. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the nature of coordinatively unsaturated Al sites on the surface of &#947;&#8208;alumina and their role as catalytically active sites.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Highly Reactive Rare&#8208;Earth Metal Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactive but easy to handle: For the first time, rare&#8208;earth metals (La, Ce, Sm, Eu, Tm, Y, Sc) are obtained as high&#8208;quality nanoparticles (1&#8211;3&#8197;nm in size) in the liquid phase. They can be highly interesting as reactive starting materials to realize new rare&#8208;earth metal compounds and/or phase&#8208;pure rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal&#8208;based materials.







Abstract
The first liquid&#8208;phase synthesis of high&#8208;quality, small&#8208;sized rare&#8208;earth metal nanoparticles (1&#8211;3&#8197;nm)&#8212;ranging from lanthanum as one of the largest (187&#8197;pm) to scandium as the smallest (161&#8197;pm) rare&#8208;earth metal&#8212;is shown. Size, oxidation state, and reactivity of the nanoparticles are examined (e.g., electron microscopy, electron spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, selected reactions). Whereas the nanoparticles are highly reactive (e.g. in contact to air and water), they are chemically stable as THF suspensions and powders under inert conditions.

     alt="Liquid-Phase Synthesis of Highly Reactive Rare-Earth Metal Nanoparticles"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reactive but easy to handle: For the first time, rare-earth metals (La, Ce, Sm, Eu, Tm, Y, Sc) are obtained as high-quality nanoparticles (1&#8211;3&#8197;nm in size) in the liquid phase. They can be highly interesting as reactive starting materials to realize new rare-earth metal compounds and/or phase-pure rare-earth-metal-based materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first liquid-phase synthesis of high-quality, small-sized rare-earth metal nanoparticles (1&#8211;3&#8197;nm)&#8212;ranging from lanthanum as one of the largest (187&#8197;pm) to scandium as the smallest (161&#8197;pm) rare-earth metal&#8212;is shown. Size, oxidation state, and reactivity of the nanoparticles are examined (e.g., electron microscopy, electron spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, selected reactions). Whereas the nanoparticles are highly reactive (e.g. in contact to air and water), they are chemically stable as THF suspensions and powders under inert conditions. The reactivity can be controlled to obtain inorganic and metal&#8211;organic compounds at room temperature.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Halogen bonding tetraphenylethene anion receptors: anion&#8208;induced emissive aggregates and photoswitchable recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of tetraphenylethene (TPE) derivatives functionalized with highly potent electron deficient perfluoroaryl iodo&#8208;triazole halogen bond (XB) donors for anion recognition are reported.  1  H NMR titration experiments, fluorescence spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering measurements, TEM imaging and X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis reveal that the tetra&#8208;substituted halogen bonding receptor forms luminescent nanoscale aggregates, the formation of which is driven by XB&#8208;mediated anion coordination. This anion&#8208;coordination induced aggregation effect serves as a powerful sensory mechanism, capable of luminescence chloride sensing at parts per billion concentration. Furthermore, the doubly substituted geometric isomers act as unprecedented photoswitchable XB donor anion receptors, where the composition of the photostationary state can be modulated by the presence of a coordinating halide anion.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;induced &#8220;molecular piping&#8221; of cyclic peptide nanotubes to form bent tubular structures is described. The process is based on the [4+4] photocycloaddition of anthracene moieties, whose structural changes derived from the interdigitated flat disposition of precursors to the corresponding cycloadduct moieties, induced the geometrical modifications in nanotubes packing that provokes their curvature. For this purpose, we designed a new class of cyclic peptide nanotubes formed by&#160;b&#8208; and&#160;a&#8208;amino acids. The presence of the former predisposes the peptide to stack in a parallel fashion with the&#160;b&#8208;residues aligned along the nanotube and the homogeneous distribution of anthracene pendants.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Controlled Janus Organic&#8208;Inorganic Nanocomposite as a Versatile Photoacoustic Platform</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a new type of organic&#8208;inorganic Janus nanocomposite (JNCP) with an asymmetric architecture following a self&#8208;assembly approach, offering unique features such as the precisely controlled localization of PA agents, combined modular PA properties, and independent responsiveness.







Abstract
Controlling the structural order of nanoparticles (NPs), morphology, and composition is of paramount significance in tailoring the physical properties of nanoassembly. However, the commonly reported symmetrical nanocomposites often suffer an interference or sacrifice of the photophysical properties of the original components. To address this challenge, we developed a novel type of organic&#8208;inorganic Janus nanocomposite (JNCP) with an asymmetric architecture, offering unique features such as the precisely controlled localization of components, combined modular optical properties, and independent stimuli. As a proof of concept, JNCPs were prepared by incorporating two photoacoustic (PA) imaging agents, namely an organic semiconducting dye and responsive gold nanoparticles (AuNP) assembly in separate compartments of JNCP. Theoretical simulation results confirmed that the formation mechanism of JNCPs arises from the entropy equilibrium in the system. The AuNP assembly generated a PA images with the variation of pH, while the semiconducting molecule served as an internal PA standard agent, leading to ratiometric PA imaging of pH. JNCP based probe holds great potential for real&#8208;time and accurate detection of diverse biological targets in living systems.

         <title>Deciphering Competitive Routes for Nickel&#8208;Based Nanoparticle Electrodeposition by an Operando Optical Monitoring</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The results of electrodeposition can be challenging to predict in the absence of unambiguous electrochemical signature. Operando optical microscopy correlated to ex&#8197;situ SEM imaging allows probing mechanistic diversity with single nanoparticle resolution. It is illustrated by differentiating, with sub&#8208;25&#8197;nm size limit of detection, the electrodeposition of Ni and Ni(OH)2 NPs upon Ni2+ reduction.







Abstract
Electrodeposition of earth&#8208;abundant iron group metals such as nickel is difficult to characterize by simple electrochemical analyses since the reduction of their metal salts often competes with inhibiting reactions. This makes the mechanistic interpretation sometimes contradictory, preventing unambiguous predictions about the nature and structure of the electrodeposited material. Herein, the complexity of Ni nanoparticles (NPs) electrodeposition on indium tin oxide (ITO) is unraveled operando and at a single entity NP level by optical microscopy correlated to ex situ SEM imaging. Our correlative approach allows differentiating the dynamics of formation of two different NP populations, metallic Ni and Ni(OH)2 with a &lt;25&#8197;nm limit of detection, their formation being ruled by the competition between Ni2+ and water reduction. At the single NP level this results in a self&#8208;terminated growth, an information which is most often hidden in ensemble averaged measurements.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first continuous flow Z&#8208;selective olefin metathesis process is reported. Key to realizing this process was the adequate choice of stereoselective catalysts combined with the design of an appropriate continuous reactor setup. The designed continuous process permits various self&#8208;, cross&#8208; and macro&#8208;ring&#8208;closing&#8208; metathesis reactions, delivering products in high selectivity and short residence times. This technique is exemplified by direct application to the preparation of a range of pheromones and macrocyclic odorant molecules and culminates in a telescoped Z&#8208;selective cross&#8208;metathesis/Dieckmann cyclisation sequence to access (Z)&#8208;Civetone, incorporating a serial array of continually stirred tank reactors.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopic Evidences of Key Intermediate Species and Role of NiFe Dual&#8208;Catalytic Center in Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NiFe&#8208;based electrocatalysts have attracted great interests due to the low price and high activity in oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the complex reaction mechanism of NiFe&#8208;catalyzed OER has not been fully explored yet. Detection of intermediate species can bridge the gap between OER performances and catalyst component/structure properties. Here, we performed label&#8208;free surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopic (SERS) monitoring of interfacial OER process on Ni  3  FeO  x  nanoparticles (NPs) in alkaline medium. By using bifunctional Au@Ni  3  FeO  x  core&#8208;satellite superstructures as Raman signal enhancer, we found direct spectroscopic evidences from intermediate O&#8208;O  &#8208;  species. According to the SERS results, Fe atoms are the catalytic sites for the initial OH  &#8208;  to O&#8208;O  &#8208;  oxidation. The O&#8208;O  &#8208;  species adsorbed across neighboring Fe and Ni sites experiences further oxidation caused by electron transfer to Ni(III) and eventually forms O  2  product. This work shows spectroscopic evidence of interfacial intermediates and confirms the dual&#8208;metal&#8208;centered catalysis in OER on NiFe oxides, which may provide a guidance for rational design of high&#8208;performance OER electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Physicochemical Understanding of the Impact of Pore Environment and Species of Adsorbates on Adsorption Behaviour</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For better design of adsorbents, it is important to know the intermolecular interaction among adsorbates and host material, leading to improved guest selectivity and uptake capacity. In this study, we demonstrate the influence of the interaction among adsorbates and substrate, controlled by the pore environment and species of adsorbates, on the adsorption behaviour. Especially, we report the unique CO2 adsorption behaviour of MOF&#8208;205 due to distinct pore geometry. The precise analysis through gas adsorption crystallography with molecular simulation shows that capillary condensation of CO2 in MOF&#8208;205 occurs preferentially in the large dodecahedral pore rather than the small tetrahedral pore, because the interaction of CO2 with MOF&#8208;205 framework relatively weaker than that among CO2 molecules, while Ar and N2 are sequentially filled into two different pores of MOF&#8208;205 following their size. Comparison of the materials with different pore environments reveals that the relative strength of the adsorbate&#8208;adsorbate and adsorbate&#8208;substrate interaction gives rise to different shapes of isotherm, which can lead to a detailed physicochemical understanding of the adsorption behaviour.</dc:description>

         <title>RNA&#8208;cleaving deoxyribozymes differentiate methylated cytidine isomers in RNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deoxyribozymes are emerging as modification&#8208;specific endonucleases for the analysis of epigenetic RNA modifications. Here, we report RNA&#8208;cleaving deoxyribozymes that differentially respond to the presence of natural methylated cytidines, 3&#8208;methylcytidine (m3C), N4&#8208;methylcytidine (m4C), and 5&#8208;methyl&#173;cytidine (m5C), respectively. Using in vitro selection, we found several DNA catalysts, which are selectively activated by only one of the three cytidine isomers, and display 10&#8208; to 30&#8208;fold accelerated cleavage of their target m3C&#8208;, m4C&#8208; or m5C&#8208;modified RNA. An additional deoxy&#173;ribozyme is strongly inhibited by any of the three methylcytidines, but effectively cleaves unmodified RNA. The mXC&#8208;detecting deoxy&#173;ribozymes are program&#173;able for the interrogation of natural RNAs of interest, as demonstrated for human mitochondrial tRNAs containing known m3C and m5C sites. The results underline the potential of synthetic functional DNA to shape highly selective active sites</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Advanced 2D nanosheets architectures that fundamentally promote ions dynamic transportation and storage capacity, are significantly pivotal for high&#8208;performance electrochemical capacitors (ECs). However, the restacking microstructure, weak interlayer conduction and blocked electroactive utilization usually lead to a low energy density. Herein, we develop an ordered hetero&#8208;architecture of MoS  2  &#8208;CNTs, in which CNTs are vertically grafted within MoS  2  framework by C&#8208;Mo covalent bond. Benefiting from this  in situ  vertical&#8208;bridge, high&#8208;speed interlaminar conductivity, unimpeded ions&#8208;diffusion channels and sufficient pseudocapacitive reactivity, the MoS  2  &#8208;CNTs presents ultra&#8208;large capacitance (5485 F g  &#8208;1  ) and good structural stability in KOH electrolyte. Moreover, the all&#8208;unified solid&#8208;state flexible ECs via direct&#8208;write printing construction deliver high energy density (226 mWh g  &#8208;1  ), good capacitance (723 F g  &#8208;1  ) and stable high/low temperature operating ability. Specifically, the flexible ECs can efficiently power display and wearable health monitoring device, which opens up a prominent way to design new multi&#8208;structural electrodes for next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage technology and wearable applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Brush Surfactants: Versatile Emulsifiers for Stabilizing and Structuring Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using amphiphilic molecular brushes to stabilize emulsions usually requires the synthesis of specific side chains, which can be a time&#8208;consuming and difficult challenge to meet. By taking advantage of the electrostatic interactions between water&#8208;soluble molecular brushes and oil&#8208;soluble oligomeric ligands, the in&#8208;situ formation, assembly and jamming of molecular brush surfactants (MBSs) at the oil&#8208;water interface is described. With MBSs, stable emulsions including o/w, w/o and o/w/o can be easily prepared by varying the molar ratios of the molecular brushes to the ligands. Moreover, when jammed, the binding energy of MBSs at the interface is sufficiently strong to allow the stabilization of liquids in nonequilibrium shapes, i.e., structuring liquids, producing an elastic film at the interface with exceptional mechanical properties. These structured liquids have numerous potential applications, including chemical biphasic reactions, liquid electronics, and all&#8208;liquid biomimetic system.</dc:description>

         <title>Integration of Bimetallic Electronic Synergy with Oxide Site Isolation for Boosting Selective Hydrogenation of Acetylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Semi&#8208;hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene is an important process to purify ethylene streams in industry. However, among current approaches reported in literature, high ethylene selectivity has been generally achieved at large expense of activity. Here we show that Ga  2  O  3  coating of Ag@Pd core&#8208;shell bimetallic particle catalysts, allows improving the ethylene selectivity to a much greater extent than coating of monometallic Pd particles, while preserving a remarkable intrinsic activity, about 50 times higher than the benchmark catalyst of Pd  1  Ag single&#8208;atom alloys (SAAs). Importantly, the resulting catalyst also shows excellent long&#8208;term stability, by suppressing coke formation efficiently. Spectroscopic characterization reveals that weakened ethylene adsorption by bimetallic electronic synergy, and oxide site isolation are both essential for the high ethylene selectivity and high&#8208;coking resistance. H&#8208;D exchange measurements further show that the Ga  2  O  3  &#8208;coated Ag@Pd catalyst possesses a much higher activity of H  2  activation than that of Pd  1  Ag SAAs, thus boosting the hydrogenation activity at the same time.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization, and Nanodisc Formation of Non&#8208;ionic Polymers**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrophobically functionalized fructo&#8208;oligosaccharides/inulin polymers were synthesized and demonstrated to form lipid bilayer nanodiscs. These non&#8208;ionic amphiphilic polymer&#8208;based nanodiscs are stable against pH and divalent metal ions and they align magnetically in the presence of an external magnetic field. The reported results also demonstrate that the non&#8208;ionic polymers extract membrane proteins with unprecedented efficiency.







Abstract
Although lipid nanodiscs are increasingly used in the structural studies of membrane proteins, drug delivery and other applications, the interaction between the nanodisc belt and the protein to be reconstituted is a major limitation. To overcome this limitation and to further broaden the scope of nanodiscs, a family of non&#8208;ionic amphiphilic polymers synthesized by hydrophobic functionalization of fructo&#8208;oligosaccharides/inulin is reported. We show the stability of lipid nanodiscs formed by these polymers against pH and divalent metal ions, and their magnetic&#8208;alignment properties. The reported results also demonstrate that the non&#8208;ionic polymers extract membrane proteins with unprecedented efficiency.

The reaction consists of hydride transfer and enantioselective [2+2] cycloaddition, which are both promoted by the spiro&#8208;bicyclic bisborane catalysts.







Abstract
Herein, we present a mild and efficient method for synthesizing enantioenriched tetrahydroquinoline&#8208;fused cyclobutenes through a cascade reaction between 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines and alkynones with catalysis by chiral spiro&#8208;bicyclic bisboranes. The bisboranes served two functions: first they catalyzed a hydride transfer to convert the 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinoline substrate to a 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinoline, and then they activated the alkynone substrate for an enantioselective [2+2] cycloaddition reaction with the 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinoline generated in situ.

         <title>Thermal&#8208;Responsive Polyoxometalate&#8211;Metalloviologen Hybrid: Reversible Intermolecular Three&#8208;Component Reaction and Temperature&#8208;Regulated Resistive Switching Behaviors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual polyoxometalate&#8208;metalloviologen hybrid with thermal&#8208;triggered reversible intermolecular multi&#8208;component reaction and structural transformation is made and used as a nonvolatile memristor, which exhibits unique temperature&#8208;regulated behavior and visual color changes for its silent and working states.







Abstract
The development of new&#8208;type memristors with special performance is of great interest. Herein, an inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid crystalline polyoxometalate (POM) with usual dynamic structures is reported and used as active material for fabricating memristor with unique temperature&#8208;regulated resistive switching behaviors. The hybrid POM not only exhibits tunable thermochromic properties, but also thermal&#8208;induced reversible aggregation and disaggregation reactions, leading to reversible structural transformations in SCSC fashion. Further, the memory device using the hybrid POM as active layer exhibits uncommon performance, which can keep resistive switching silent in the low temperature range of 30&#8211;150&#8201;&#176;C, but show nonvolatile memory behavior in the high temperature range of 150&#8211;270&#8201;&#176;C. Particularly, the silent and working states at three special temperatures (30, 150 and 270&#8201;&#176;C) can be monitored by chromism. The correlation between structure and resistive switching property of the material has been discussed. The work demonstrates that crystalline inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid POMs are promising materials for making memristors with superior performance.

         <title>High Proton&#8208;Conductivity in Covalently Linked Polyoxometalate&#8208; Organoboronic Acid&#8208;Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyoxometalate polymers with high proton conductivity are accessed for the first time by controlled covalent polymerization of Wells&#8211;Dawson&#8208;type niobotungstate and organoboronic acid monomers. The resulting polymer features a purely inorganic backbone, organic sidechains, and acts as a solid&#8208;state proton conductor.







Abstract
The controlled bottom&#8208;up design of polymers with metal oxide backbones is a grand challenge in materials design, as it could give unique control over the resulting chemical properties. Herein, we report a 1D&#8208;organo&#8208;functionalized polyoxometalate polymer featuring a purely inorganic backbone. The polymer is self&#8208;assembled from two types of monomers, inorganic Wells&#8211;Dawson&#8208;type polyoxometalates, and aromatic organo&#8208;boronates. Their covalent linkage results in 1D polymer strands, which combine an inorganic oxide backbone (based on B&#8722;O and Nb&#8722;O linkages) with functional organic side&#8208;chains. The polymer shows high bulk proton conductivity of up to 1.59&#215;10&#8722;1&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 90&#8201;&#176;C and 98&#8201;% relative humidity. This synthetic approach could lead to a new class of organic&#8211;inorganic polymers where function can be designed by controlled tuning of the monomer units.

         <title>Surface Engineering and Controlled Ripening for Seed&#8208;Mediated Growth of Au Islands on Au Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The growth of secondary structures on pre&#8208;existing metal seeds can be achieved by controlling the interfacial energy between the seed and the deposited material, the degree of oxidative ripening, and the surface diffusion of metal precursors. This method yields Au nanostructures with morphologies tunable from core&#8208;satellites to tetramers, trimers, and dimers.







Abstract
Engineering the nucleation and growth of plasmonic metals (Ag and Au) on their pre&#8208;existing seeds is expected to produce nanostructures with unconventional morphologies and plasmonic properties that may find unique applications in sensing, catalysis, and broadband energy harvesting. Typical seed&#8208;mediated growth processes take advantage of the perfect lattice match between the deposited metal and seeds to induce conformal coating, leading to either simple size increases (e.g., Au on Au) or the formation of core&#8211;shell structures (e.g., Ag on Au) with limited morphology change. In this work, we show that the introduction of a thin layer of metal with considerable lattice mismatch can effectively induce the nucleation of well&#8208;defined Au islands on Au nanocrystal seeds. By controlling the interfacial energy between the seed and the deposited material, the oxidative ripening, and the surface diffusion of metal precursors, we can regulate the number of islands on the seeds and produce complex Au nanostructures with morphologies tunable from core&#8208;satellites to tetramers, trimers, and dimers.

         <title>Direct Immunodetection of Global A&#8208;to&#8208;I RNA Editing Activity with a Chemiluminescent Bioassay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adenosine&#8208;to&#8208;inosine (A&#8208;to&#8208;I) editing is a critical RNA modification, dysregulation of which is linked with autoimmune disease, neurodegenerative disorders, and several types of cancer. Here, we develop a protein&#8208;based chemiluminescent bioassay to rapidly characterize global A&#8208;to&#8208;I editing signatures in normal and diseased human tissue, addressing a significant technological need for studying RNA editing and its relationship with disease.







Abstract
Adenosine&#8208;to&#8208;inosine (A&#8208;to&#8208;I) editing is a conserved eukaryotic RNA modification that contributes to development, immune response, and overall cellular function. Here, we utilize Endonuclease&#8197;V (EndoV), which binds specifically to inosine in RNA, to develop an EndoV&#8208;linked immunosorbency assay (EndoVLISA) as a rapid, plate&#8208;based chemiluminescent method for measuring global A&#8208;to&#8208;I editing signatures in cellular RNA. We first optimize and validate our assay with chemically synthesized oligonucleotides. We then demonstrate rapid detection of inosine content in treated cell lines, demonstrating equivalent performance against current standard RNA&#8208;seq approaches. Lastly, we deploy our EndoVLISA for profiling differential A&#8208;to&#8208;I RNA editing signatures in normal and diseased human tissue, illustrating the utility of our platform as a diagnostic bioassay. Together, the EndoVLISA method is cost&#8208;effective, straightforward, and utilizes common laboratory equipment, offering a highly accessible new approach for studying A&#8208;to&#8208;I editing. Moreover, the multi&#8208;well plate format makes this the first assay amenable for direct high&#8208;throughput quantification of A&#8208;to&#8208;I editing for applications in disease detection and drug development.

         <title>Cyanine&#8208;Dyad Molecular Probe for the Simultaneous Profiling of the Evolution of Multiple Radical Species During Bacterial Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular probe HCy5&#8208;Cy7 turns on its emission at 660&#8197;nm via superoxide or hydroxyl radical&#8208;mediated oxidation of the reduced HCy5 moiety to Cy5, while peroxynitrite or hypochlorous species&#8208;induced Cy7 structural degradation leads to the emission turn&#8208;off at 800&#8197;nm. This allows the imaging of in&#8197;situ oxidative and nitrosative stress events during the pathogenic and defensive processes of bacterial infection in both macrophage cells and living mice.







Abstract
Real&#8208;time monitoring of the evolution of bacterial infection&#8208;associated multiple radical species is critical to accurately profile the pathogenesis and host&#8208;defense mechanisms. Here, we present a unique dual wavelength near&#8208;infrared (NIR) cyanine&#8208;dyad molecular probe (HCy5&#8208;Cy7) for simultaneous monitoring of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) variations both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. HCy5&#8208;Cy7 specifically turns on its fluorescence at 660&#8197;nm via superoxide or hydroxyl radical (O2.&#8722;, .OH)&#8208;mediated oxidation of reduced HCy5 moiety to Cy5, while peroxynitrite or hypochlorous species (ONOO&#8722;, ClO&#8722;)&#8208;induced Cy7 structural degradation causes the emission turn&#8208;off at 800&#8197;nm. Such multispectral but reverse signal responses allow multiplex manifestation of in&#8197;situ oxidative and nitrosative stress events during the pathogenic and defensive processes in both bacteria&#8208;infected macrophage cells and living mice. Most importantly, this study may also provide new perspectives for understanding the bacterial pathogenesis and advancing the precision medicine against infectious diseases.

&lt;p&gt;The molecular probe HCy5-Cy7 turns on its emission at 660&#8197;nm via superoxide or hydroxyl radical-mediated oxidation of the reduced HCy5 moiety to Cy5, while peroxynitrite or hypochlorous species-induced Cy7 structural degradation leads to the emission turn-off at 800&#8197;nm. This allows the imaging of in&#8197;situ oxidative and nitrosative stress events during the pathogenic and defensive processes of bacterial infection in both macrophage cells and living mice.

         <title>Structural Changes during the Growth of Atomically Precise Metal Oxido Nanoclusters from Combined Pair Distribution Function and Small&#8208;Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining X&#8208;ray total scattering and small angle X&#8208;ray scattering, it is possible to obtain unique insight into the formation of atomically precise nanoclusters. In a study of bismuth oxide clusters (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202103641), Michael Mehring, Kirsten&#8197;M.&#8197;&#216;. Jensen et&#8197;al. investigate the formation of&#160;[Bi38O45] clusters from&#160;[Bi6O8], and show that an intermediate structure of [Bi22O26] play an important role in the process. This intermediate structure was identified through a new automated modelling&#160;approach.

         <title>Void Space vs. Surface Functionalization for Proton Conduction in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Studies of proton conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have focused on increasing the charge carrier density. Of equal importance is the correlation of intrinsic properties (porosity and surface functionalization) of MOFs with conductivity. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202106181), Jihan Kim, Dae&#8208;Woon Lim, Hiroshi Kitagawa et&#8197;al. establish a correlation for proton conductivity in MOFs with the porosity and surface functionality. The confinement effect is essential for strengthening the hydrogen bonds leading to high proton conductivity.

Silylene&#8208;tethered Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling enables the synthesis of partially fluorinated phenylene&#8211;ethynylene (PFPE) oligomers on Ag(111), as reported by Akihiro Orita, Shigeki Kawai et&#8197;al in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202102882). The desilylative Sonogashira reaction achieved a high chemoselectivity up to 75&#8201;% while the competing Ullmann homo&#8208;coupling and desilylative Glaser coupling were suppressed.

Anisotropic synthetic melanins&#160;have been achieved by solid&#8208;state polymerization, as reported by Nathan&#8197;C. Gianneschi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202103447). Ellipsoidal platelets of melanin, found to date only in biology, are obtained through pre&#8208;organizing the 4&#8208;4&#8242; dihydroxynaphthalene dimer as the building block, followed by solid&#8208;state oxidative polymerization to give polymeric melanin materials without changing their overall morphology.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Based Microparticle Tension Sensors (&#956;TS) for Measuring Cell Mechanics in Non&#8208;planar Geometries and for High&#8208;Throughput Quantification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microparticle tension sensor is designed for measuring molecular forces in non&#8208;planar geometries and for high&#8208;throughput flow cytometry analysis of cell mechanics.







Abstract
Mechanotransduction, the interplay between physical and chemical signaling, plays vital roles in many biological processes. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques to quantify cell forces employ deformable polymer films or molecular probes tethered to glass substrates. However, the applications of these assays in fundamental and clinical research are restricted by the planar geometry and low throughput of microscopy readout. Herein, we develop a DNA&#8208;based microparticle tension sensor, which features a spherical surface and thus allows for investigation of mechanotransduction at curved interfaces. The micron&#8208;scale of &#956;TS enables flow cytometry readout, which is rapid and high throughput. We applied the method to map and measure T&#8208;cell receptor forces and platelet integrin forces at 12 and 56&#8197;pN thresholds. Furthermore, we quantified the inhibition efficiency of two anti&#8208;platelet drugs providing a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of &#956;TS to screen drugs that modulate cellular mechanics.

         <title>Catalytic System&#8208;Controlled Divergent Reaction Strategies for the Construction of Diversified Spiropyrazolone Skeletons from Pyrazolidinones and Diazopyrazolones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A catalytic system&#8208;controlled divergent reaction strategy was here reported to construct four types of intriguing spiroheterocyclic skeletons from simple and readily available starting materials via  a precise chemical bond activation/[n+1] annulation cascade. The tetraazaspiroheterocyclic and trizazspiroheterocyclic scaffolds could be independently constructed by a selective N&#8208;N bond activation/[n+1] annulation cascade, a C(sp 2  )&#8208;H activation/[4+1] annulation and a novel tandem C(sp 2  )&#8208;H/C(sp 3  )&#8208;H bond activation/[4+1] annulation strategy, along with a broad scope of substrates, moderate to excellent yields and value transformations. More importantly, in these transformations, we are the first time to capture a N&#8208;N bond activation and a C(sp 3  )&#8208;H bond activation of pyrazolidinones under different catalytic system.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Acid&#8208;Assisted Hydrogenation of Oximes to Hydroxylamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15524-15532, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Half&#8208;sandwich iridium(III) complexes are found to be efficient catalysts for homogeneous oxime hydrogenation to hydroxylamine products, only if equipped with an aryl&#8208;imine ligand and operating under strong acidic conditions. Remarkably they do not hydrogenolyse the fragile N&#8722;O bond. Experimental evidence suggests an unusual acid&#8208;assisted ionic hydrogenation mechanism which may be applicable to the reduction of other challenging substrates.







Abstract
We found that cyclometalated cyclopentadienyl iridium(III) complexes are uniquely efficient catalysts in homogeneous hydrogenation of oximes to hydroxylamine products. A stable iridium C,N&#8208;chelation is crucial, with alkoxy&#8208;substituted aryl ketimine ligands providing the best catalytic performance. Several Ir&#8208;complexes were mapped by X&#8208;ray crystal analysis in order to collect steric parameters that might guide a rational design of even more active catalysts. A broad range of oximes and oxime ethers were activated with stoichiometric amounts of methanesulfonic acid and reduced at room temperature, remarkably without cleavage of the fragile N&#8722;O bond. The exquisite functional group compatibility of our hydrogenation system was further demonstrated by additive tests. Experimental mechanistic investigations support an ionic hydrogenation platform, and suggest a role for the Br&#248;nsted acid beyond a proton source. Our studies provide deep understanding of this novel acidic hydrogenation and may facilitate its improvement and application to other challenging substrates.

         <title>Novel Insight into Proximal DNA Domain Interactions from Temperature&#8208;Controlled Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15390-15398, July 5, 2021. </description>

Hybrid duplex&#8211;quadruplex oligonucleotides comprised of multiple domains have not been yet properly investigated because of their structural complexity. A new method based on native mass spectrometry (MS) coupled with a custom&#8208;built temperature&#8208;controlled nanoelectrospray ionization (TCnESI) source is introduced to investigate effects between multiple proximal DNA domains.







Abstract
Quadruplexes are non&#8208;canonical nucleic acid structures essential for many cellular processes. Hybrid quadruplex&#8211;duplex oligonucleotide assemblies comprised of multiple domains are challenging to study with conventional biophysical methods due to their structural complexity. Here, we introduce a novel method based on native mass spectrometry (MS) coupled with a custom&#8208;built temperature&#8208;controlled nanoelectrospray ionization (TCnESI) source designed to investigate interactions between proximal DNA domains. Thermal denaturation experiments were aimed to study unfolding of multi&#8208;stranded oligonucleotide constructs derived from biologically relevant structures and to identify unfolding intermediates. Using the TCnESI MS, we observed changes in Tm and thermodynamic characteristics of proximal DNA domains depending on the number of domains, their position, and order in a single experiment.

         <title>In&#8208;situ Nano&#8208;Crystallization and Solvation Modulation to Promote Highly Stable Anode Involving Alloy/De&#8208;alloy for Potassium Ion Batteries</title>

An in situ nano&#8208;crystallization easing volume exchange of the hierarchical particle and a stable and robust SEI formed on the particle lead to a (BiO)2CO3 based electrode wih a highly stable cycling performance during 1500&#8197;cycles, providing a new sight for anode materials design and an understanding about the relationship between solvation and SEI formation.







Abstract
For advanced anode materials involving alloy/de&#8208;alloy chemistry for potassium ion batteries (PIBs), two&#8208;dimensional (2D) bismuth subcarbonate (BCO) nanosheets that possess high theoretical capacity of 631&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 are proposed. The large lattice spacing of 0.683&#8197;nm along b axis facilitate insertion of K+ ion to boost high&#8208;capacity delivery of ca. 610&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, and the in situ nano&#8208;crystallization well ease volume changes of the integrated particle and shorten ion diffusion path during potassiation/depotassiation. After coupling with a concentrated KFSI&#8208;G2 electrolyte, the robust and efficient SEI built from enhanced participation of FSI&#8722; synergistically endow structural stability of the flower&#8208;like BCO, and enable a prolonged cycling performance with capacity of ca. 300&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 for 1500&#8197;cycles, achieving an ultralow decay rate of 0.007&#8201;%. Mechanistic investigations probe the electrochemistry involving alloy/de&#8208;alloy and phase transition of the electrode.

         <title>Collective Vibrational Strong Coupling Effects on Molecular Vibrational Relaxation and Energy Transfer: Numerical Insights via Cavity Molecular Dynamics Simulations**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15533-15540, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We performed cavity molecular dynamics simulations and showed that, under vibrational strong coupling conditions, vibrational relaxation and energy transfer from hot to thermal molecules can be accelerated relative to that outside a cavity due to polariton&#8208;accelerated intermolecular vibrational energy transfer.







Abstract
For a small fraction of hot CO2 molecules immersed in a liquid&#8208;phase CO2 thermal bath, classical cavity molecular dynamics simulations show that forming collective vibrational strong coupling (VSC) between the C=O asymmetric stretch of CO2 molecules and a cavity mode accelerates hot&#8208;molecule relaxation. This acceleration stems from the fact that polaritons can be transiently excited during the nonequilibrium process, which facilitates intermolecular vibrational energy transfer. The VSC effects on these rates 1)&#8197;resonantly depend on the cavity mode detuning, 2)&#8197;cooperatively depend on Rabi splitting, and 3)&#8197;collectively scale with the number of hot molecules. For larger cavity volumes, the average VSC effect per molecule can remain meaningful for up to N&#8776;104 molecules forming VSC. Moreover, the transiently excited lower polariton prefers to relax by transferring its energy to the tail of the molecular energy distribution rather than distributing it equally to all thermal molecules. As far as the parameter dependence is concerned, the vibrational relaxation data presented here appear analogous to VSC catalysis in Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot microcavities.

Seamless low&#8208;temperature syntheses, crystallization and spectroscopies provide structural details of the heterobimetallic reagent routinely used for regioselective carbon&#8722;carbon bond forming reactions with carbonyl compounds. 7Li&#8197;NMR spectroscopy takes on an important role here, tracking down n&#8208;BuLi dissociation.







Abstract
CeCl3(thf) reacts at low temperatures with MeLi, t&#8208;BuLi, and n&#8208;BuLi to isolable organocerium complexes. Solvent&#8208;dependent extensive n&#8208;BuLi dissociation is revealed by 7Li NMR spectroscopy, suggesting &#8220;Ce(n&#8208;Bu)3(thf)x&#8221; or solvent&#8208;separated ion pairs like &#8220;[Li(thf)4][Ce(n&#8208;Bu)4(thf)y]&#8221; as the dominant species of the Imamoto reagent. The stability of complexes Li3Ln(n&#8208;Bu)6(thf)4 increases markedly with decreasing LnIII size. Closer inspection of the solution behavior of crystalline Li3Lu(n&#8208;Bu)6(thf)4 and mixtures of LuCl3(thf)2/n&#8208;BuLi in THF indicates occurring n&#8208;BuLi dissociation only at molar ratios of &lt;1:3. n&#8208;BuLi&#8208;depleted complex LiLu(n&#8208;Bu)3Cl(tmeda)2 was obtained by treatment of Li2Lu(n&#8208;Bu)5(tmeda)2 with ClSiMe3, at the expense of LiCl incorporation. Imamoto's ketone/tertiary alcohol transformation was examined with 1,3&#8208;diphenylpropan&#8208;2&#8208;one, affording 99&#8201;% of alcohol.

         <title>Antiprotozoal Structure&#8211;Activity Relationships of Synthetic Leucinostatin Derivatives and Elucidation of their Mode of Action</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15613-15621, July 5, 2021. </description>

A structure&#8211;activity relationship of the natural product Leucinostatin A was performed to result in two highly potent compounds against the protozoa Trypanosoma brucei with decreased toxic effects in vitro and in vivo. Those compounds did not form any resistance by long&#8208;time sublethal exposure and their mode of action lies in the destabilization of the inner mitochondrial membrane.







Abstract
Leucinostatin A is one of the most potent antiprotozoal compounds ever described, but little was known on structure&#8211;activity relationships (SAR). We used Trypanosoma brucei as a protozoal model organism to test synthetically modified derivatives, resulting in simplified but equally active compounds 2 (ZHAWOC6025) and 4 (ZHAWOC6027), which were subsequently modified in all regions of the molecule to gain an in&#8208;depth SAR understanding. The antiprotozoal SAR matched SAR in phospholipid liposomes, where membrane integrity, leaking, and dynamics were studied. The mode of action is discussed based on a structure&#8211;activity analysis of derivatives in efficacy, ultrastructural studies in T. brucei, and artificial membrane models, mimicking membrane stability and membrane potential. The main site of antiprotozoal action of natural and synthetic leucinostatins lies in the destabilization of the inner mitochondrial membrane, as demonstrated by ultrastructural analysis, electron microscopy and mitochondrial staining. Long&#8208;time sublethal exposure of T. brucei (200 passages) and siRNA screening of 12&#8242;000 mutants showed no signs of resistance development to the synthetic derivatives.

         <title>Hydrothermal Synthesis of Zinc&#8208;Doped Silica Nanospheres Simultaneously Featuring Stable Fluorescence and Long&#8208;Lived Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15490-15496, July 5, 2021. </description>

A facile hydrothermal synthetic strategy was developed for directly preparing zinc&#8208;doped silica nanospheres (Zn@SiNSs) in water, which can produce stable fluorescence (UV on) and long&#8208;lived room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (UV off) in water.







Abstract
Fluorescence and phosphorescence are known as two kinds of fundamental optical signals, which have been used for myriad applications. To date, simultaneous activation of stable fluorescence and long&#8208;lived room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emission in the aqueous phase remains a big challenge. We prepare zinc&#8208;doped silica nanospheres (Zn@SiNSs) with fluorescence and RTP properties using a facile hydrothermal synthetic strategy. For the as&#8208;prepared Zn@SiNSs, the recombination of electrons and holes in defects and defect&#8208;stabilized excitons derived from oxygen vacancy/C=N bonds lead to the production of stable fluorescence and long&#8208;lived RTP (emission lasting for &#8776;9&#8197;s, quantum yield (QY): &#8776;33.6&#8201;%, RTP lifetime: &#8776;236&#8197;ms). The internal Si&#8722;O bonded networks and hydrophilic surface in Zn@SiNSs can reduce nonradiative decay to form self&#8208;protective RTP, and also provide high water solubility, excellent pH&#8208; and photostability.

We describe a tumor&#8208;targeting yet enhanced chemotherapy, which is enabled by nanomicelles self&#8208;assembled from multivalent aptamer drug conjugates. Co&#8208;self&#8208;assembly with a multivalent PEG&#8208;conjugated drug analogue reaches an optimal complementation between the blood circulation and tumor&#8208;targeting ability of the nanomicelles, which augments the antitumor immune responses of the checkpoint blockade.







Abstract
A tumor&#8208;targeting enhanced chemotherapy, enabled by aptamer&#8208;drug conjugate nanomicelles, is reported that boosts antitumor immune responses. Multivalent aptamer drug conjugate (ApMDC), an amphiphilic telodendrimer consisting of a hydrophilic aptamer and a hydrophobic monodendron anchored with four anticancer drugs by acid&#8208;labile linkers, was designed and synthesized. By co&#8208;self&#8208;assembly with an ApMDC analogue, in which aptamer is replaced with polyethylene glycol, the surface aptamer density of these nanomicelles can be screened to reach an optimal complementation between blood circulation and tumor&#8208;targeting ability. Optimized nanomicelles can enhance immunogenic cell death of tumor cells, which strikingly augments the tumor&#8208;specific immune responses of the checkpoint blockade in immunocompetent tumor&#8208;bearing mice. ApMDC nanomicelles represent a robust platform for structure&#8211;function optimization of drug conjugates and nanomedicines.

         <title>Atomic Tungsten on Graphene with Unique Coordination Enabling Kinetically Boosted Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15563-15571, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic tungsten on graphene with a unique W state of the W&#8208;N2O2 structure are first used to decorate the separator of a Li&#8208;S battery to promote its electrochemical performance. The unique local coordination structure of W&#8208;O2N2&#8208;C moiety not only acts as an active site for anchoring lithium polysulfides, but also boosts their kinetic conversion via electrocatalysis.







Abstract
Use of catalytic materials is regarded as the most desirable strategy to cope with sluggish kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) transformation and severe shuttle effect in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with 100&#8201;% atom&#8208;utilization are advantagous in serving as anchoring and electrocatalytic centers for LiPSs. Herein, a novel kind of tungsten (W) SAC immobilized on nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (W/NG) with a unique W&#8208;O2N2&#8208;C coordination configuration and a high W loading of 8.6&#8197;wt&#8201;% is proposed by a self&#8208;template and self&#8208;reduction strategy.

     alt="Atomic Tungsten on Graphene with Unique Coordination Enabling Kinetically Boosted Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atomic tungsten on graphene with a unique W state of the W-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; structure are first used to decorate the separator of a Li-S battery to promote its electrochemical performance. The unique local coordination structure of W-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-C moiety not only acts as an active site for anchoring lithium polysulfides, but also boosts their kinetic conversion via electrocatalysis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use of catalytic materials is regarded as the most desirable strategy to cope with sluggish kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) transformation and severe shuttle effect in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with 100&#8201;% atom-utilization are advantagous in serving as anchoring and electrocatalytic centers for LiPSs. Herein, a novel kind of tungsten (W) SAC immobilized on nitrogen-doped graphene (W/NG) with a unique W-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-C coordination configuration and a high W loading of 8.6&#8197;wt&#8201;% is proposed by a self-template and self-reduction strategy. The local coordination environment of W atom endows the W/NG with elevated LiPSs adsorption ability and catalytic activity. LSBs equipped with W/NG modified separator manifest greatly improved electrochemical performances with high cycling stability over 1000&#8197;cycles and ultrahigh rate capability. It indicates high areal capacity of 6.24&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with robust cycling life at a high sulfur mass loading of 8.3&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Implications of Quenching&#8208;to&#8208;Dequenching Switch in Quantitative Cell Uptake and Biodistribution of Dye&#8208;Labeled Nanoparticles</title>

A ubiquitous quenching&#8208;to&#8208;dequenching switch of dye&#8208;labeled nanoparticles in vitro and in vivo is presented. When dye&#8208;labeled nanoparticles interact with biological systems (cell culture medium, cells, and organs to animals), the dye undergoes the switch, causing a significant increase of fluorescence intensity.







Abstract
A general strategy to carry out cell uptake and biodistribution studies is to label nanoparticles (NPs) with a fluorescent dye. However, the comparative study of different dye&#8208;loaded NPs remains difficult owing to uncontrolled dye quenching and de&#8208;quenching. Here we compared two types of dye&#8208;labeled NPs and demonstrated their distinct properties. NPs with dye molecules at a solid state suffer from dye quenching, so the dye release and/or NP degradation in biological environments leads to a several&#8208;fold increase of fluorescence intensity despite the same amount of NPs, owing to the state switch from quenching to de&#8208;quenching. In contrast, NPs with dye molecules at a soluble state exhibit no quenching effect. To standardize the comparative study, we propose two possible solutions: using lower dye loading or using medium analysis for quantifying cell uptake of NPs. This work provides valuable insights into selecting valid quantification methods for bio&#8208;nano studies.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Linked Cyclopentadienyl Rhodium(III) Complexes&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric C&#8722;H Arylation of Benzo[h]quinolines with 1&#8208;Diazonaphthoquinones</title>

         <dc:description>
A class of chiral cyclopentadienyl ligands (BOCps) bearing an oxygen linker was developed. The BOCpRh complexes are powerful catalysts in an asymmetric C&#8722;H arylation of benzo[h]quinolines with 1&#8208;diazonaphthoquinones to construct axially chiral heterobiaryls. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that this reaction is likely to proceed via an electrophilic C&#8722;H rhodation and subsequent coupling with 1&#8208;diazonaphthoquinones.







Abstract
Chiral cyclopentadienyl rhodium (CpRh) complex&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H functionalization reactions have witnessed a significant progress in organic synthesis. In sharp contrast, the reported chiral Cp ligands are limited to C&#8208;linked Cp and are often synthetically challenging. To address these issues, we have developed a novel class of tunable chiral cyclopentadienyl ligands bearing oxygen linkers, which were efficient catalysts for C&#8722;H arylation of benzo[h]quinolines with 1&#8208;diazonaphthoquinones, affording axially chiral heterobiaryls in excellent yields and enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% yield, 98.5:1.5 er). Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction is likely to proceed by electrophilic C&#8722;H activation, and followed by coupling of the cyclometalated rhodium(III) complex with 1&#8208;diazonaphthoquinones.

         <title>Sustainable Lithium&#8208;Metal Battery Achieved by a Safe Electrolyte Based on Recyclable and Low&#8208;Cost Molecular Sieve</title>

Low&#8208;cost 3&#8197;&#197; zeolite was used to sieve the excess solvents within Li&#8208;ion solvation sheaths of typical carbonate electrolyte to eliminate the adverse effects (high&#8208;voltage/temperature oxidation, unstable CEI/SEI). As a result, high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;metal battery (LMB) that used this zeolite sieved electrolyte demonstrated a significantly improved cycling time and safety, but largely reduced production cost.







Abstract
As one typical clean&#8208;energy technologies, lithium&#8208;metal batteries, especially high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries which use concentrated electrolytes hold promising prospect for the development of a sustainable world. However, concentrated electrolytes with aggregative configurations were achieved at the expense of using extra dose of costly and environmental&#8208;unfriendly salts/additives, which casts a shadow over the development of a sustainable world. Herein, without using any expensive salts/additives, we employed commercially&#8208;available low&#8208;cost and environmental&#8208;friendly molecular sieves (zeolite) to sieve the solvation sheath of lithium ions of classic commercialized electrolyte (LiPF6&#8208;EC/DMC), and resulting in a unique zeolite sieved electrolyte which was more aggregative than conventional concentrated electrolytes. Inspiringly, the new&#8208;designed electrolyte exhibited largely enhanced anti&#8208;oxidation stability under high&#8208;voltage (4.6&#8197;volts) and elevated temperature (55&#8201;&#176;C). NCM&#8208;811//Li cells assembled with this electrolyte delivered ultra&#8208;stable rechargeabilities (over 1000&#8197;cycles for half&#8208;cell; 300&#8197;cycles for pouch&#8208;cell). More importantly, sustainable NCM&#8208;811//Li pouch&#8208;cell with negligible capacity decay can also be obtained through using recyclable zeolite sieved electrolyte. This conceptually&#8208;new way in preparing safe and highly&#8208;efficient electrolyte by using low&#8208;price molecular sieve would accelerate the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion/lithium&#8208;metal batteries.

STM breaking junction and shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy techniques have been successfully applied to probe a solvent modification induced interfacial electronic effect on tuning contact geometries and electron transport of pyridyl molecules at atomically flat Au (111). Modulation of binding geometry from vertical to tilted and flat is observed and a 316&#8201;% modulation of single&#8208;molecule conductance is achieved.







Abstract
Clarifying interfacial electronic effects on molecular adsorption is significant in many chemical and biochemical processes. Here, we used STM breaking junction and shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy to probe electron transport and adsorption geometries of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (4,4&#8242;&#8208;BPY) at Au(111). Modifying the surface with 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium cation&#8208;containing ionic liquids (ILs) decreases surface electron density and stabilizes a vertical orientation of pyridine through nitrogen atom &#963;&#8208;bond interactions, resulting in uniform adsorption configurations for forming molecular junctions. Modulation from vertical, tilted, to flat, is achieved on adding water to ILs, leading to a new peak ascribed to CC stretching of adsorbed pyridyl ring and 316&#8201;% modulation of single&#8208;molecule conductance. The dihedral angle between adsorbed pyridyl ring and surface decreases with increasing surface electronic density, enhancing electron donation from surface to pyridyl ring.

A new approach for the rational construction of chains of Group&#8197;14 metal atoms linked by unsupported metal&#8211;metal bonds is reported, which exploits hemilabile ancillary ligands to generate unsaturated metal sites. The resulting oligo&#8208;dimetallyne chains feature alternating single and double metal&#8211;metal bonds.







Abstract
We present a novel approach for constructing chains of Group&#8197;14 metal atoms linked by unsupported metal&#8211;metal bonds that exploits hemilabile ligands to generate unsaturated metal sites. The formation/nature of catenated species (oligo&#8208;dimetallynes) can be controlled by the use of (acidic/basic) &#8220;protecting groups&#8221; and through variation of the ligand scaffold. Reduction of ArNiPr2GeCl (ArNiPr2=2,6&#8208;(iPr2NCH2)2C6H3)&#8212;featuring hemilabile NiPr2 donors&#8212;yields (ArNiPr2Ge)4 (2), which contains a tetrameric Ge4 chain. 2 represents a novel type of a linear homo&#8208;catenated GeI compound featuring unsupported E&#8722;E bonds. Trapping experiments reveal that a key structural component is the central two&#8208;way Ge=Ge donor&#8208;acceptor bond: reactions with IMe4 and W(CO)5(NMe3) give the base&#8208; or acid&#8208;stabilized digermynes (ArNiPr2Ge(IMe4))2 (4) and (ArNiPr2Ge{W(CO)5})2 (5), respectively. The use of smaller N&#8208;donors leads to stronger Ge&#8208;N interactions and quenching of catenation behaviour: reduction of ArNEt2GeCl gives the digermyne (ArNEt2Ge)2, while the unsymmetrical system ArNEt2GeGeArNiPr2 dimerizes to give tetranuclear (ArNEt2GeGeArNiPr2)2 through aggregation at the NiPr2&#8208;ligated GeI centres.

         <title>Mechanism of the Arene&#8208;Limited Nondirected C&#8722;H Activation of Arenes with Palladium**
</title>

         <dc:description>
A mechanistic study of the dual&#8208;ligand&#8208;enabled directing&#8208;group&#8208;free C&#8722;H activation of arenes with palladium catalysts and the arene as limiting reagent is described. A detailed experimental and computational investigation supports a 1:1:1 complex of palladium and the two complementary ligands as the active species that enables a partially rate&#8208;limiting concerted C&#8722;H activation as part of a Pd0/PdII cycle.







Abstract
Recently palladium catalysts have been discovered that enable the directing&#8208;group&#8208;free C&#8722;H activation of arenes without requiring an excess of the arene substrate, thereby enabling methods for the late&#8208;stage modification of complex organic molecules. The key to success has been the use of two complementary ligands, an N&#8208;acyl amino acid and an N&#8208;heterocycle. Detailed experimental and computational mechanistic studies on the dual&#8208;ligand&#8208;enabled C&#8722;H activation of arenes have led us to identify the catalytically active species and a transition state model that explains the exceptional activity and selectivity of these catalysts. These findings are expected to be highly useful for further method development using this powerful class of catalysts.

         <title>Electrolyte Structure of Lithium Polysulfides with Anti&#8208;Reductive Solvent Shells for Practical Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15503-15509, July 5, 2021. </description>

The electrolyte structure of lithium polysulfides (PSs) with anti&#8208;reductive solvent shells was unveiled. The reduction resistance of the solvent shell is proven to be a key reason for the decreased reactivity of PSs towards Li. With isopropyl ether as a cosolvent, the reactivity of PSs is suppressed by encapsulating PSs into anti&#8208;reductive solvent shells. The stability of practical Li&#8211;S batteries was improved and a pouch cell of 300&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 was demonstrated.







Abstract
The lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery is regarded as a promising secondary battery. However, constant parasitic reactions between the Li anode and soluble polysulfide (PS) intermediates significantly deteriorate the working Li anode. The rational design to inhibit the parasitic reactions is plagued by the inability to understand and regulate the electrolyte structure of PSs. Herein, the electrolyte structure of PSs with anti&#8208;reductive solvent shells was unveiled by molecular dynamics simulations and nuclear magnetic resonance. The reduction resistance of the solvent shell is proven to be a key reason for the decreased reactivity of PSs towards Li. With isopropyl ether (DIPE) as a cosolvent, DIPE molecules tend to distribute in the outer solvent shell due to poor solvating power. Furthermore, DIPE is more stable than conventional ether solvents against Li metal. The reactivity of PSs is suppressed by encapsulating PSs into anti&#8208;reductive solvent shells. Consequently, the cycling performance of working Li&#8211;S batteries was significantly improved and a pouch cell of 300&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 was demonstrated. The fundamental understanding in this work provides an unprecedented ground to understand the electrolyte structure of PSs and the rational electrolyte design in Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Large Telluroxane Bowls Connected by a Layer of Iodine Ions</title>

Large telluroxane clusters are formed during the hydrolysis of [PhTeI3]2 or the oxidation of [PhTe]2 with iodine under hydrolytic conditions. They consist of two half&#8208;spheres with {(PhTe)19O24}9+ networks, which are connected by 18 iodine atoms. The central {PhTe}3+ units of each half&#8208;sphere can be replaced by other metal ions. Mass spectrometry shows that the intact clusters are transferred to the gas phase without dissociation.







Abstract
Phenyltelluroxane clusters of the composition [{(PhTe)19O24}2I18(solv)] (1) are formed during the hydrolysis of [PhTeI3]2 or the oxidation of various phenyltellurium(II) compounds with iodine under hydrolytic conditions. The compounds consist of two half&#8208;spheres with a {(PhTe)19O24}9+ network, which are connected by 18 iodine atoms. The spherical clusters can accommodate solvent molecules such as pyridine or methanol in the center of two rings formed by iodine atoms. The presence of other metal ions during the cluster formation results in a selective replacement of the central {PhTe}3+ units of each half&#8208;sphere as has been demonstrated with the isolation of [{(PhTe)18({Ca(H2O)2}O24}2I16] (2) and [{(PhTe)18({Y(NO3)(H2O)}O24}2I16] (3). A crownether&#8208;like coordination by six oxygen atoms of the telluroxane network is found for the {Ca(H2O}2}2+ and {Y(NO3)(H2O)}2+ building blocks. Mass spectrometric studies show that considerable amounts of the intact clusters are transferred to the gas phase without dissociation.

The presence of other metal ions during the cluster formation results in a selective replacement of the central {PhTe}&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; units of each half-sphere as has been demonstrated with the isolation of [{(PhTe)&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;({Ca(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}O&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) and [{(PhTe)&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;({Y(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)}O&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;). A crownether-like coordination by six oxygen atoms of the telluroxane network is found for the {Ca(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and {Y(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)}&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; building blocks. Mass spectrometric studies show that considerable amounts of the intact clusters are transferred to the gas phase without dissociation.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Quantitative and Multiplexed Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging of Intercellular Tensile Forces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15548-15555, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorescence lifetime imaging&#8208;based cell membrane&#8208;anchored DNA hairpin probe is designed to measure tensile forces at cell&#8211;cell junctions. The tension among multiple ligand&#8211;receptor pairs can be quantified simultaneously during cellular processes such as the epithelial&#8211;mesenchymal transition.







Abstract
Mechanical interactions between cells have been shown to play critical roles in regulating cell signaling and communications. However, the precise measurement of intercellular forces is still quite challenging, especially considering the complex environment at cell&#8211;cell junctions. In this study, we report a fluorescence lifetime&#8208;based approach to image and quantify intercellular molecular tensions. Using this method, tensile forces among multiple ligand&#8211;receptor pairs can be measured simultaneously. We first validated our approach and developed lifetime measurement&#8208;based DNA tension probes to image E&#8208;cadherin&#8208;mediated tension on epithelial cells. These probes were then further applied to quantify the correlations between E&#8208;cadherin and N&#8208;cadherin tensions during an epithelial&#8211;mesenchymal transition process. The modular design of these probes can potentially be used to study the mechanical features of various physiological and pathological processes.

         <title>Dioxygen Activation and Pyrrole &#945;&#8208;Cleavage with Calix[4]pyrrolato Aluminates: Enzyme Model by Structural Constraint</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15632-15640, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of triplet dioxygen with closed shell molecules is formally spin&#8208;forbidden. Nature overcomes this prohibition by a variety of enzymes. The surprising reactivity of calix[4]pyrrolato aluminate with O2 is described and the spin&#8208;inversion process is analyzed. The square&#8208;planar aluminates transpire as enzyme models that substantiate the critical role of metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity and structural constraint for the functions of aerobic life.







Abstract
The present work describes the reaction of triplet dioxygen with the porphyrinogenic calix[4]pyrrolato aluminates to alkylperoxido aluminates in high selectivity. Multiconfigurational quantum chemical computations disclose the mechanism for this spin&#8208;forbidden process. Despite a negligible spin&#8211;orbit coupling constant, the intersystem crossing (ISC) is facilitated by singlet and triplet state degeneracy and spin&#8211;vibronic coupling. The formed peroxides are stable toward external substrates but undergo an unprecedented oxidative pyrrole &#945;&#8208;cleavage by ligand aromatization/dearomatization&#8208;initiated O&#8722;O &#963;&#8208;bond scission. A detailed comparison of the calix[4]pyrrolato aluminates with dioxygen&#8208;related enzymology provides insights into the ISC of metal&#8208; or cofactor&#8208;free enzymes. It substantiates the importance of structural constraint and element&#8211;ligand cooperativity for the functions of aerobic life.

         <title>Halide Replacement with Complete Preservation of Crystal Lattice in Mixed&#8208;Anion Lanthanide Oxyhalides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15582-15589, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topochemical halide ion replacement in lanthanide oxyiodide nanostructures proceeds with complete preservation of the tetragonal matlockite crystal structure along a gradient of increasing anion hardness. Reformation of the anion lattice around the intact cation slabs impedes 5D3&#8208;5D4 phonon&#8208;assisted cross relaxation and is observed as a distinctive blue hue for an embedded quantum reporter.







Abstract
A challenge in anion control in periodic solids is to preserve the crystal lattice while substituting for different anions of widely varying size and hardness. Post&#8208;synthetic modification routes that place cations or anions in non&#8208;equilibrium configurations are promising; however, such methods remain relatively unexplored for anion placement. Here, we report the synthesis of LaOI nanocrystals by a non&#8208;hydrolytic sol&#8208;gel condensation reaction and their transformation into LaOBr, LaOCl, and LaOF nanocrystals along hard&#8211;soft acid&#8211;base principles using post&#8208;synthetic metathesis reactions with ammonium halides. Anion displacement proceeds along halide planes, preserving the tetragonal matlockite structure. Energy&#8208;variant X&#8208;ray excited optical luminesce signatures of alloyed Tb3+&#8208;ions is a sensitive quantum reporter of the preservation of the cation sublattice and hardening of the crystal structure upon anion replacement.

         <title>Engineering Nanoparticulate Organic Photocatalysts via a Scalable Flash Nanoprecipitation Process for Efficient Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15590-15597, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flash nanoprecipitation (FNP) method with rationally designed hydrophilic polymers to prepare nanoparticulate photocatalysts is presented. It is effective in addressing limitations of bulky particles and greatly improving the photocatalytic activity. This nanostructure engineering is promising for scale&#8208;up owing to the continuous operation of FNP, leading to potential practical applications of solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversions.







Abstract
Directly converting sunlight into hydrogen fuels using particulate photocatalysts represents a sustainable route for clean energy supply. Organic semiconductors have emerged as attractive candidates but always suffer from optical and exciton recombination losses with large exciton &#8220;dead zone&#8221; inside the bulk material, severely limiting the catalytic performance. Herein, we demonstrate a facile strategy that combines a scalable flash nanoprecipitation (FNP) method with hydrophilic soluble polymers (PC&#8208;PEG5 and PS&#8208;PEG5) to prepare highly efficient nanosized photocatalysts without using surfactants. Significantly, a 70&#8208;fold enhancement of hydrogen evolution rate (HER) is achieved for nanosized PC&#8208;PEG5, and the FNP&#8208;processed PS&#8208;PEG5 shows a peak HER rate of up to 37.2&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 under full&#8208;spectrum sunlight irradiation, which is among the highest results for polymer photocatalysts. A scaling&#8208;up production of nanocatalyst is demonstrated with the continuously operational FNP.

This has enabled the development of an oxidative photocatalytic approach for the direct conversion of carboxylic acids into disulfides as well as a related approach for the installation of a disulfide moiety by remote C&#8722;H functionalization.







Abstract
The direct conversion of carboxylic acids into disulfides is described. The approach employs oxidative photocatalysis for base&#8208;promoted decarboxylation of the substrate, which yields an alkyl radical that reacts with a trisulfide dioxide through homolytic substitution. The trisulfide dioxides are easily prepared by a newly described approach. 1&#176;, 2&#176;, and 3&#176; carboxylic acids with varied substitution are good substrates, including amino acids and substrates with highly activated C&#8722;H bonds. Trisulfide dioxides are also used to achieve the &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H disulfuration of amides through a radical relay sequence. In both reactions, the sulfonyl radical that results from substitution propagates the reaction. Factors governing the selectivity of substitution at S2 versus S3 of the trisulfide dioxides have been explored.

         <title>Degradation in Order: Simple and Versatile One&#8208;Pot Combination of Two Macromolecular Concepts to Encode Diverse and Spatially Regulated Degradability Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15482-15489, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual polymerization approach creates new possibilities to access polymeric materials with sequence&#8208;controlled primary structure and diverse degradable bonds. The methodology is overall simple and effective and involves an in situ organocatalyst switch, which leads to different polymerization mechanisms, and as a consequence, specific degradability functions are encoded.







Abstract
The clever one&#8208;pot combination of two macromolecular concepts, ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) and step&#8208;growth polymerization (SGP), is demonstrated to be a simple, yet powerful tool to design a library of sequence&#8208;controlled polymers with diverse and spatially regulated degradability functions. ROP and SGP occur sequentially at room temperature when the organocatalytic conditions are switched from basic to acidic, and each allows the encoding of specific degradable bonds. ROP controls the sequence length and position of the degradability functions, while SGP between the complementary vinyl ether and hydroxyl chain&#8208;ends enables the formation of acetal bonds and high&#8208;molar&#8208;mass copolymers. The result is the rational combination of cleavable bonds prone to either bulk or surface erosion within the same macromolecule. The strategy is versatile and offers higher chemical diversity and level of control over the primary structure than current aliphatic polyesters or polycarbonates, while being simple, effective, and atom&#8208;economical and having potential for scalability.

The controlled oxidation from thioether to sulfoxide and sulfone groups is a new post&#8208;synthetic modification to achieve the stimuli&#8208;responsive structural transformation from the molecular Borromean ring to tetranuclear metallacycles.







Abstract
A Cp*&#8208;Rh based D&#8208;shaped binuclear metallacycle and a template&#8208;free molecular Borromean ring (BR) were obtained in high yield using the semi&#8208;rigid thioether dipyridyl ligand 1,4&#8208;bis[(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;ylthio)methyl]benzene (Bptmb). The topological transformation from a binuclear metallacycle and a BR to tetranuclear metallacycles was realized via the controlled oxidation of thioethers. The strategy used in this work can be regarded as a new form of stimuli&#8208;responsive post&#8208;synthesis modification (PSM).

         <title>Rhenium&#8208;Catalyzed Arylation&#8211;Acyl Cyclization between Enol Lactones and Organomagnesium Halides: Facile Synthesis of Indenones</title>

A range of functionalized organomagnesium halides and enol lactones underwent rhenium&#8208;catalyzed sequential arylation&#8211;acyl cyclization under mild reaction conditions, thus providing an expedient route to polyfunctionalized indenones with complete control of regioselectivity. This approach features a broad substrate scope, excellent functional group tolerance, and synthetic utility in the straightforward synthesis of biologically relevant molecules.







Abstract
A set of rhenium&#8208;catalyzed arylation&#8211;acyl cyclizations between (hetero)arylmagnesium halides and enol lactones through a cascade C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2)/C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2) bond formation under mild reaction conditions has been developed. Indeed, a wide range of functional groups on both organomagnesium halides and enol lactones is well tolerated by the simple rhenium catalysis, thus furnishing polyfunctionalized indenones in one&#8208;pot fashion and with complete control of the regioselectivity. Moreover, this approach also provides a straightforward synthetic route to neolignan and (iso)pauciflorol&#8197;F. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the reaction involves a sequence of syn&#8208;carborhenation and intramolecular nucleophilic addition.

         <title>Single Fluorinated Agent for Multiplexed 19F&#8208;MRI with Micromolar Detectability Based on Dynamic Exchange</title>

Relying on principles of supramolecular chemistry, this manuscript describes the design, characterization, and implementation of a method for the generation of artificial (non&#8208;luminescent) colors for MRI applications. The proposed approach, which is termed GEST, exploits the reversible binding of inhalable biocompatible fluorinated agent to macrocycle hosts for micromolar detectability of host&#8211;guest complexes using background&#8208;free 19F&#8208;MRI.







Abstract
The weak thermal polarization of nuclear spins limits the sensitivity of MRI, even for MR&#8208;sensitive nuclei as fluorine&#8208;19. Therefore, despite being the source of inspiration for the development of background&#8208;free MRI for various applications, including for multiplexed imaging, the inability to map very low concentrations of targets using 19F&#8208;MRI raises the need to further enhance this platform's capabilities. Here, we employ the principles of CEST&#8208;MRI in 19F&#8208;MRI to obtain a 900&#8208;fold signal amplification of a biocompatible fluorinated agent, which can be presented in a &#8220;multicolor&#8221; fashion. Capitalizing on the dynamic interactions in host&#8211;guest supramolecular assemblies in an approach termed GEST, we demonstrate that an inhalable fluorinated anesthetic can be used as a single 19F&#8208;probe for the concurrent detection of micromolar levels of two targets, with potential in vivo translatability. Further extending GEST with new designs could expand the applicability of 19F&#8208;MRI to the mapping of targets that have so&#8208;far remained non&#8208;detectable.

Cytochrome P450 CxnD exhibited C&#8722;S bond forming activity in chuangxinmycin biosynthesis, generating the unique tricyclic indole&#8208;S&#8208;hetero scaffold from thiol intermediates. Structural characterization of CxnD with a substrate analogue proposed a radical mechanism initiated by abstraction of the imino hydrogen atom or an electron from indole group of the substrate.







Abstract
Microbial sulfur&#8208;containing secondary metabolites show various biological activities, but the C&#8722;S bond&#8208;forming in their biosynthetic metabolism has not been thoroughly understood. Here, we present genetic, biochemical and structural characterization of a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CxnD exhibiting C&#8722;S bond forming activity in S&#8208;heterocyclization of chuangxinmycin biosynthesis. In vivo and in vitro analyses demonstrated that CxnD generated an indole&#8208;fused dihydrothiopyran skeleton from a L&#8208;Trp&#8208;derived thiol intermediate. Furthermore, X&#8208;ray crystal structure of CxnD in complex with a substrate analogue and structure&#8208;based mutagenesis revealed intimate details of the substrate binding mode. A radical mechanism initiated by abstraction of the imino hydrogen atom or an electron from indole group of the substrate was proposed for CxnD, which provided valuable insights into the molecular basis for the intra&#8208;molecular C(sp2)&#8722;H thiolation by the P450 in chuangxinmycin biosynthesis.

         <title>The Role of Rotational Motion in Diffusion NMR Experiments on Supramolecular Assemblies: Application to Sup35NM Fibrils</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15445-15451, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diffusion of amyloid fibrils that contain disordered domains can be captured by pulsed&#8208;field&#8208;gradient NMR experiments. A new theory is presented that interprets the results of these measurements in terms of fibrils&#8217; translational and rotational motion. Application to Sup35NM fibrils demonstrates the feasibility of diffusion&#8208;based sorting in complex amyloidogenic samples.







Abstract
Pulsed&#8208;field gradient (PFG) NMR is an important tool for characterization of biomolecules and supramolecular assemblies. However, for micrometer&#8208;sized objects, such as amyloid fibrils, these experiments become difficult to interpret because in addition to translational diffusion they are also sensitive to rotational diffusion. We have constructed a mathematical theory describing the outcome of PFG NMR experiments on rod&#8208;like fibrils. To test its validity, we have studied the fibrils formed by Sup35NM segment of the prion protein Sup35. The interpretation of the PFG NMR data in this system is fully consistent with the evidence from electron microscopy. Contrary to some previously expressed views, the signals originating from disordered regions in the fibrils can be readily differentiated from the similar signals representing small soluble species (e.g. proteolytic fragments). This paves the way for diffusion&#8208;sorted NMR experiments on complex amyloidogenic samples.

         <title>Purification of Propylene and Ethylene by a Robust Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Mediated by Host&#8211;Guest Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15541-15547, July 5, 2021. </description>

A comprehensive understanding of the host&#8211;guest chemistry of MFM&#8208;520 at a molecular level rationalises the observed high selectivity towards olefins, and informs future designs of improved materials for challenging olefin/paraffin separations in industry.







Abstract
Industrial purification of propylene and ethylene requires cryogenic distillation and selective hydrogenation over palladium catalysts to remove propane, ethane and/or trace amounts of acetylene. Here, we report the excellent separation of equimolar mixtures of propylene/propane and ethylene/ethane, and of a 1/100 mixture of acetylene/ethylene by a highly robust microporous material, MFM&#8208;520, under dynamic conditions. In situ synchrotron single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, inelastic neutron scattering and analysis of adsorption thermodynamic parameters reveal that a series of synergistic host&#8211;guest interactions involving hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interactions underpin the cooperative binding of alkenes within the pore. Notably, the optimal pore geometry of the material enables selective accommodation of acetylene. The practical potential of this porous material has been demonstrated by fabricating mixed&#8208;matrix membranes comprising MFM&#8208;520, Matrimid and PIM&#8208;1, and these exhibit not only a high permeability for propylene (&#8776;1984 Barrer), but also a separation factor of 7.8 for an equimolar mixture of propylene/propane at 298&#8197;K.

A rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed dealkenylative arylation of alkenes and 1,3&#8208;dienes with arylboronic compounds has been developed to provide an unconventional access to bi(hetero)aryls with excellent chemo&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
The C&#8722;C bond formation reaction represents a fundamental and important transformation in synthetic chemistry, and exploring new types of C&#8722;C bond formation reactions is recognized as appealing, yet challenging. Herein, we disclose the first example of rhodium&#8208;catalyzed dealkenylative arylation of alkenes with arylboronic compounds, thereby providing an unconventional access to bi(hetero)aryls with excellent chemoselectivity. In this method, C(aryl)&#8722;C(alkenyl) and C(alkenyl)&#8722;C(alkenyl) bonds in various alkenes and 1,3&#8208;dienes can be cleaved via a hydrometalation and followed by &#946;&#8208;carbon elimination pathway for Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reactions. Furthermore, a series of novel organic fluorescent molecules with excellent photophysical properties has been efficiently constructed with this protocol.

An azidosugar ZIF&#8208;8 carrier camouflaged with cancer cell membranes was devised to mimic cancer cell behaviors, and it accomplished cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;selective metabolic glycan labeling (MGL) in vivo. With abundant receptors, this biomimetic platform not only selectively targets homotypic cells but also realizes selective MGL for different breast cancer subtypes.







Abstract
Metabolic glycan labeling (MGL) followed by bioorthogonal chemistry provides a powerful tool for tumor imaging and therapy. However, selectively metabolic labeling of cells or tissues of interest remains a challenge. Particularly, owing to tumor heterogeneity including tumor subtypes and interpatient heterogeneity, it is far more difficult to realize tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;selective metabolic labeling for precise diagnosis. Inspired by nature, we designed azidosugar&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic frameworks camouflaged with cancer cell membranes to accomplish cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;selective MGL in vivo. With abundant receptors, this biomimetic platform not only selectively targets homotypic cells but also realizes different breast cancer subtype&#8208;selective MGL. Moreover, the endo/lysosomal&#8208;escaped ZIF&#8208;8 can make azidosugar escape from lysosomes and accelerate its metabolic incorporation. This strategy also takes advantage of cancer&#8208;tissue&#8208;derived cell membranes, which may have huge potential for personalized diagnosis and therapy.

A facile and green polyoxometallate (POM)&#8208;assisted hydrothermal carbonization strategy is developed for synthesis of carbonaceous hybrid nanomaterials with molecularly dispersed POMs and ordered mesopores, which exhibit remarkable catalytic activity toward the dehydration of tert&#8208;butanol.







Abstract
Hybrid nanomaterials with controlled dimensions, intriguing components and ordered structures have attracted significant attention in nanoscience and technology. Herein, we report a facile and green polyoxometallate (POM)&#8208;assisted hydrothermal carbonization strategy for synthesis of carbonaceous hybrid nanomaterials with molecularly dispersed POMs and ordered mesopores. By using various polyoxometallates such as ammonium phosphomolybdate, silicotungstic acid, and phosphotungstic acid, our approach can be generalized to synthesize ordered mesoporous hybrid nanostructures with diverse compositions and morphologies (nanosheet&#8208;assembled hierarchical architectures, nanospheres, and nanorods). Moreover, the ordered mesoporous nanosheet&#8208;assembled hierarchical hybrids with molecularly dispersed POMs exhibit remarkable catalytic activity toward the dehydration of tert&#8208;butanol with the high isobutene selectivity (100&#8201;%) and long&#8208;term catalytic durability (80&#8197;h).

         <title>ZIF&#8208;Based Nanoparticles Combine X&#8208;Ray&#8208;Induced Nitrosative Stress with Autophagy Management for Hypoxic Prostate Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15472-15481, July 5, 2021. </description>

X&#8208;ray&#8208;triggered nitrite (NO2&#8722;) is used for hypoxic prostate cancer therapy by inhibiting protective autophagy and inducing lethal nitrosative stress based on ZIF&#8208;82&#8208;PVP. After entering tumor cells, the released 2&#8208;nitroimidazole ligands capture low&#8208;energy electrons derived from X&#8208;rays to produce NO2&#8722;, and the Zn2+ inhibits the migration and invasion of tumor cells.







Abstract
Although reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated tumor treatments are predominant in clinical applications, ROS&#8208;induced protective autophagy promotes cell survival, especially in hypoxic tumors. Herein, X&#8208;ray triggered nitrite (NO2&#8722;) is used for hypoxic prostate cancer therapy by inhibiting autophagy and inducing nitrosative stress based on an electrophilic zeolitic imidazole framework (ZIF&#8208;82&#8208;PVP). After internalization of pH&#8208;responsive ZIF&#8208;82&#8208;PVP nanoparticles, electrophilic ligands and Zn2+ are delivered into cancer cells. Electrophilic ligands can not only consume GSH under hypoxia but also capture low&#8208;energy electrons derived from X&#8208;rays to generate NO2&#8722;, which inhibits autophagy and further elevates lethal nitrosative stress levels. In addition, dissociated Zn2+ specifically limits the migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells through ion interference. In&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo results indicate that ZIF&#8208;82&#8208;PVP nanoparticles under X&#8208;ray irradiation can effectively promote the apoptosis of hypoxic prostate cancer cells. Overall, this nitrosative stress&#8208;mediated tumor therapy strategy provides a novel approach targeting hypoxic tumors.

         <title>Rational Design of a Highly Selective Near&#8208;Infrared Two&#8208;Photon Fluorogenic Probe for Imaging Orthotopic Hepatocellular Carcinoma Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15418-15425, July 5, 2021. </description>

In this report, we show that a carbamate as recognition unit has an excellent selectivity for a hepatocellular carcinoma chemotherapy (HCC)&#8208;related biomarker (carboxylesterase, CE) without interference from other hydrolases. We developed a near&#8208;infrared two&#8208;photon fluorescent probe with high selectivity and strong fluorescence signals towards CE activity, enabling it to successfully monitor CE activity for evaluating HCC chemotherapy in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Selective fluorescence imaging of biomarkers in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;situ for evaluating orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) chemotherapy remains a great challenge due to current imaging agents suffering from the potential interferences of other hydrolases. Herein, we observed that carbamate unit showed a high selectivity toward the HCC&#8208;related biomarker carboxylesterase (CE) for evaluation of treatment. A near&#8208;infrared two&#8208;photon fluorescent probe was developed to not only specially image CE activity in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;situ but also target orthotopic liver tumor after systemic administration. The in&#8197;vivo signals of the probe correlate well with tumor apoptosis, making it possible to evaluate the status of treatment. The probe enables the imaging of CE activity in&#8197;situ with a high&#8208;resolution three&#8208;dimensional view for the first time. This study may promote advances in optical imaging approaches for precise imaging&#8208;guided diagnosis of HCC in&#8197;situ and its evaluation of treatment.

We present an ion&#8208;mobility mass spectrometry (IM&#8208;MS) study on the encapsulation characteristics of a shape&#8208;adaptable organometallic metallocage, and demonstrate that IM&#8208;MS in combination with DFT calculations constitutes a reliable approach to quantify distortions experienced by the host upon guest encapsulation.







Abstract
The encapsulation of the tetracationic palladium metallosquare with four pyrene&#8208;bis&#8208;imidazolylidene ligands [1]4+ with a series of organic molecules was studied by Electrospray ionization Travelling Wave Ion&#8208;Mobility Mass Spectrometry (ESI TWIM&#8208;MS). The method allowed to determine the Collision Cross Sections (CCSs), which were used to assess the size changes experienced by the host upon encapsulation of the guest molecules. When fullerenes were used as guests, the host is expanded &#916;CCS 13&#8197;&#197;2 and 23&#8197;&#197;2, for C60 or C70, respectively. The metallorectangle [1]4+ was also used for the encapsulation of a series of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and naphthalenetetracarboxylic diimide (NTCDI), to form complexes of formula [(NTCDI)2(PAH)@1]4+. For these host:guest adducts, the ESI IM&#8208;MS studies revealed that [1]4+ is expanded by 47&#8211;49&#8197;&#197;2.. The energy&#8208;minimized structures of [1]4+, [C60@1]4+, [C70@1]4+, [(NTCDI)2(corannulene)@1]4+ in the gas phase were obtained by DFT calculations.Introduction

A quenching&#8208;to&#8208;dequenching switch of fluorescence&#8208;labeled nanoparticles in biological environments is unveiled by Chun&#8208;Xia Zhao and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;15426. With dye molecules in a solid state, the release and/or degradation of the dye&#8208;labeled nanoparticles in biological environments led to a several&#8208;fold increase in fluorescence intensity due to the state switch, which has significant implications in quantitative cell uptake and biodistribution studies.

Leucinostatins are fascinating natural substances, with high potency against many pathogens, but their acute toxicity has prevented therapeutic use. Michael Adams, Rainer Riedl, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate in the Research Article on page&#8197;15613 how these can be converted into synthetically more accessible and more selective antiprotozoal agents with broad efficacy and undetectable resistance.

Temperature&#8208;controlled nanoelectrospray ionization explores the thermodynamics of hybrid quadruplex&#8211;duplex oligonucleotide assemblies comprising multiple domains and brings insight into mutual domain interaction. As described by Renato Zenobi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article on page&#8197;15390, thermal denaturation experiments were conducted to reveal unfolding intermediates and changes in the thermodynamics of DNA complexes depending on the number of domains and their position in a single MS experiment.

After more than seven decades, Criegee intermediates (CIs) are back at the forefront of modern chemistry. They play an important role in the mechanisms of chemical reactions, total synthesis, pharmaceuticals, climate&#8208;controlling aerosol formation, as well as atmospheric chemistry. This Minireview summarizes key aspects of CIs, highlights recent progress in CI chemistry, and illustrates possibilities for further investigations.







Abstract
After more than 70&#8197;years since their discovery, Criegee intermediates (CIs) are back at the forefront of modern chemistry of short&#8208;lived reactive intermediates. They play an important role in the mechanistic context of chemical synthesis, total synthesis, pharmaceuticals, and, most importantly, climate&#8208;controlling aerosol formation as well as atmospheric chemistry. This Minireview summarizes key aspects of CIs (from the mechanism of formation, for example, by ozonolysis of alkenes and photolysis methods employing diiodo and diazo compounds, to their electronic structures and chemical reactivity), highlights the most recent findings and some landmark results of gas&#8208;phase kinetics, and detection/measurements. The recent progress in synthetic and mechanistic studies in the chemistry of CIs provides a guide to illustrate the possibilities for further investigations in this exciting field.

         <title>The Role of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks in Electronic Sensors</title>

Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) that respond to physical and chemical stimuli are promising materials for electronic sensors owing to their outstanding sensing performance. In this Review, the functionality of MOFs as a mass&#8208;loaded layer, filtration layer, electronic function layer, and optically sensitive layer is discussed.







Abstract
MOFs have a highly ordered self&#8208;assembled nanostructure, high surface area, nanoporosity with tunable size and shape, reliable host&#8211;guest interactions, and responsiveness to physical and chemical stimuli which can be exploited to address critical issues in sensor applications. On the one hand, the nanoscale pore size of MOFs ranging from less than 1&#8197;nm to &#8776;&#8197;10&#8197;nm not only allows the diffusion of small molecules into the pores or through the MOF layer, but also excludes other larger molecules depending on the size, shape, and conformation of MOFs. On the other hand, MOFs with flexible structure exhibit a dynamic response to external stimuli, including guest molecules, temperature, pressure, pH, and light. Due to the unsaturated coordination metal sites and active functional groups, the interaction between certain analytes and active sites results in high selectivity. In this review, we summarize the latest studies on MOF&#8208;based electronic sensors in terms of the function of MOFs, discuss challenges, and suggest perspectives.

Metal&#8211;organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks, polymers, and composites are disruptive key technologies for gas separation membranes. This Minireview highlights the state of the art in materials and material development and their utilization in membrane applications in highly relevant processes such as carbon capture, energy&#8208; and resource&#8208;efficient separations of basic chemicals, and quantum sieving.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been thoroughly investigated with regards to applications in gas separation membranes in the past years. More recently, new preparation methods for MOFs and COFs as particles and thin&#8208;film membranes, as well as for mixed&#8208;matrix membranes (MMMs) have been developed. We will highlight novel processes and highly functional materials: Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) can be transformed into glasses and we will give an insight into their use for membranes. In addition, liquids with permanent porosity offer solution processability for the manufacture of extremely potent MMMs. Also, MOF materials influenced by external stimuli give new directions for the enhancement of performance by in situ techniques. Presently, COFs with their large pores are useful in quantum sieving applications, and by exploiting the stacking behavior also molecular sieving COF membranes are possible. Similarly, porous polymers can be constructed using MOF templates, which then find use in gas separation membranes.

This review summarizes the outer&#8208;surface interactions of cucurbit[n]urils (OSIQ) in various simple cucurbit[n]uril&#8208;based supramolecular frameworks (QSFs) and QSFs assembled via self&#8208;induced OSIQ, anion&#8208;induced OSIQs, and aromatic&#8208;induced OSIQs. The design and construction of QSFs with novel structures and specific functional properties establishes a new research direction in cucurbit[n]uril chemistry.







Abstract
Porous materials, especially metal&#8211;organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks, and supramolecular organic frameworks, are widely used in heterogeneous catalysis, adsorption, and ion exchange. Cucurbit[n]urils (Q[n]s) suitable building units for porous materials because they possess cavities with neutral electrostatic potential, portal carbonyls with negative electrostatic potential, and outer surfaces with positive electrostatic potential, which may result in the formation of Q[n]&#8208;based supramolecular frameworks (QSFs) assembled through the interaction of guests within Q[n]s, the coordination of Q[n]s with metal ions, and outer&#8208;surface interaction of Q[n]s (OSIQ). This review summarizes the various QSFs assembled via OSIQs. The QSFs can be classified as being assembled by 1)&#8197;self&#8208;induced OSIQ, 2)&#8197;anion&#8208;induced OSIQ, and 3)&#8197;aromatic&#8208;induced OSIQ. The design and construction of QSFs with novel structures and specific functional properties may establish a new research direction in Q[n] chemistry.

         <title>Reversible Supra&#8208;Folding of User&#8208;Programmed Functional DNA Nanostructures on Fuzzy Cationic Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15214-15219, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
User&#8208;defined DNA nanostructures (origamis, nanogrids) undergo an astonishing higher&#8208;order folding transition, referred to as supra&#8208;folding, when they adsorb on soft cationic polymeric surfaces. Upon addition of a competitive anionic polyelectrolyte, supra&#8208;folded origamis unfold back to their original shape with preserved structural features and site&#8208;specific functionality (tethered function or protein).







Abstract
We report that user&#8208;defined DNA nanostructures, such as two&#8208;dimensional (2D) origamis and nanogrids, undergo a rapid higher&#8208;order folding transition, referred to as supra&#8208;folding, into three&#8208;dimensional (3D) compact structures (origamis) or well&#8208;defined &#956;m&#8208;long ribbons (nanogrids), when they adsorb on a soft cationic substrate prepared by layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer deposition of polyelectrolytes. Once supra&#8208;folded, origamis can be switched back on the surface into their 2D original shape through addition of heparin, a highly charged anionic polyelectrolyte known as an efficient competitor of DNA&#8208;polyelectrolyte complexation. Orthogonal to DNA base&#8208;pairing principles, this reversible structural reconfiguration is also versatile; we show in particular that 1)&#8197;it is compatible with various origami shapes, 2)&#8197;it perfectly preserves fine structural details as well as site&#8208;specific functionality, and 3)&#8197;it can be applied to dynamically address the spatial distribution of origami&#8208;tethered proteins.

         <title>The Origin of Catalytic Benzylic C&#8722;H Oxidation over a Redox&#8208;Active Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15243-15247, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidation of benzylic C&#8722;H groups in a broad range of substrates under mild conditions has been achieved using a robust metal&#8211;organic framework, MFM&#8208;170, incorporating redox&#8208;active [Cu2II(O2CR)4] paddlewheel nodes. EPR spectroscopy and synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction have identified the critical role of the paddlewheel moiety in activating the oxidant tBuOOH (tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide) via partial reduction to [CuIICuI(O2CR)4] species.







Abstract
Selective oxidation of benzylic C&#8722;H compounds to ketones is important for the production of a wide range of fine chemicals, and is often achieved using toxic or precious metal catalysts. Herein, we report the efficient oxidation of benzylic C&#8722;H groups in a broad range of substrates under mild conditions over a robust metal&#8211;organic framework material, MFM&#8208;170, incorporating redox&#8208;active [Cu2II(O2CR)4] paddlewheel nodes. A comprehensive investigation employing electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction has identified the critical role of the paddlewheel moiety in activating the oxidant tBuOOH (tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide) via partial reduction to [CuIICuI(O2CR)4] species.

         <title>High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Magnesium&#8208;Air Battery Based on Dual&#8208;Layer Gel Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15317-15322, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;layer gel electrolyte was designed to simultaneously prevent the corrosion of Mg anode and production of the dense passive layer in a Mg&#8208;air battery. The resulting Mg&#8208;air battery exhibited a specific capacity of 2190&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 based on total anodic weight and an energy density of 2282&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 based on the total weight of anode and air electrode. It was further made into a fiber shape with high flexibility.







Abstract
Mg&#8208;air batteries are explored as the next&#8208;generation power systems for wearable and implantable electronics as they could work stably in neutral electrolytes and are also biocompatible. However, high corrosion rate and low utilization of Mg anode largely impair the performance of Mg&#8208;air battery with low discharge voltage, poor specific capacity and low energy density. Here, to the best of our knowledge, we first report a dual&#8208;layer gel electrolyte to simultaneously solve the above two problems by preventing the corrosion of Mg anode and the production of dense passive layer, respectively. The resulting Mg&#8208;air batteries produced an average specific capacity of 2190&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 based on the total Mg anode (99.3&#8201;% utilization rate of Mg anode) and energy density of 2282&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 based on the total anode and air electrode, both of which are the highest among the reported Mg&#8208;air batteries. Besides, our Mg&#8208;air batteries could be made into a fiber shape, and they were flexible to work stably under various deformations such as bending and twisting.

         <title>Scaffold&#8208;Directed Face Selectivity Machine&#8208;Learned from Vectors of Non&#8208;covalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15230-15235, July 5, 2021. </description>

A machine&#8208;learning, ML, model based on vectors of transition&#8208;state interatomic contacts can predict face&#8208;selectivity of Michael additions or Diels&#8211;Alder cycloadditions more accurately than traditional ML schemes, energetic calculations, or seasoned organic chemists.







Abstract
This work describes a method to vectorize and Machine&#8208;Learn, ML, non&#8208;covalent interactions responsible for scaffold&#8208;directed reactions important in synthetic chemistry. Models trained on this representation predict correct face of approach in ca. 90&#8201;% of Michael additions or Diels&#8211;Alder cycloadditions. These accuracies are significantly higher than those based on traditional ML descriptors, energetic calculations, or intuition of experienced synthetic chemists. Our results also emphasize the importance of ML models being provided with relevant mechanistic knowledge; without such knowledge, these models cannot easily &#8220;transfer&#8208;learn&#8221; and extrapolate to previously unseen reaction mechanisms.

A practical synthesis of SF5Cl from sulfur powder, dry KF, and trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCCA) in MeCN is described. The new synthetic utility of SF5Cl is well demonstrated by the chemoselective hydro(chloro)pentafluorosulfanylation of diazo compounds.







Abstract
Pentafluorosulfanyl chloride (SF5Cl) is the most prevalent reagent for the incorporation of SF5 group into organic compounds. However, the preparation of SF5Cl often relies on hazardous reagents and specialized apparatus. Herein, we described a safe and practical synthesis of a bench&#8208;stable and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle solution of SF5Cl in n&#8208;hexane under gas&#8208;reagent&#8208;free conditions. The synthetic application of SF5Cl was demonstrated through the unprecedented reaction with diazo compounds. The chemoselective hydro&#8208; and chloropentafluorosulfanylations of &#945;&#8208;diazo carbonyl compounds were developed in the presence of K3PO4 or copper catalyst, respectively. These reactions provide a direct and efficient access to various &#945;&#8208;pentafluorosulfanyl carbonyl compounds of high value for potential applications.

         <title>Programming Fluorogenic DNA Probes for Rapid Detection of Steroids</title>

Aptamers based on forced intercalation (FIT) were developed to detect steroids such as dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate in clinical human serum samples. These FIT&#8208;aptamers offer several advantages over gold standard methods, including rapid readout (&lt;30&#8197;min), simple instrumentation (plate&#8208;reader), and low sample volumes (10&#8197;&#956;L).







Abstract
The ability of aptamers to recognize a variety of different molecules has fueled their emergence as recognition agents to probe complex media and cells. Many detection strategies require aptamer binding to its target to result in a dramatic change in structure, typically from an unfolded to a folded state. Here, we report a strategy based on forced intercalation (FIT) that increases the scope of aptamer recognition by transducing subtle changes in aptamer structures into fluorescent readouts. By screening a library of green&#8208;fluorescent FIT&#8208;aptamers whose design is guided by computational modeling, we could identify hits that sense steroids like dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) down to 1.3&#8197;&#956;M with no loss in binding affinity compared to the unmodified aptamer. This enabled us to study DHEAS in clinical serum samples with several advantages over gold standard methods, including rapid readout (&lt;30&#8197;min), simple instrumentation (plate&#8208;reader), and low sample volumes (10&#8197;&#956;L).

&lt;p&gt;The ability of aptamers to recognize a variety of different molecules has fueled their emergence as recognition agents to probe complex media and cells. Many detection strategies require aptamer binding to its target to result in a dramatic change in structure, typically from an unfolded to a folded state. Here, we report a strategy based on forced intercalation (FIT) that increases the scope of aptamer recognition by transducing subtle changes in aptamer structures into fluorescent readouts. By screening a library of green-fluorescent FIT-aptamers whose design is guided by computational modeling, we could identify hits that sense steroids like dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) down to 1.3&#8197;&#956;M with no loss in binding affinity compared to the unmodified aptamer. This enabled us to study DHEAS in clinical serum samples with several advantages over gold standard methods, including rapid readout (&amp;lt;30&#8197;min), simple instrumentation (plate-reader), and low sample volumes (10&#8197;&#956;L).&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Green Fluorescent Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Aromatic Belt Containing a [6]Cycloparaphenylene Skeleton</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15291-15295, July 5, 2021. </description>

The first nitrogen&#8208;doped aromatic belt with a [6]cycloparaphenylene skeleton ([6]CPP) was conveniently synthesized from calix[3]carbazole. The aromatic belt showed an enhanced &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure and a deep cavity, and also exhibited strong green fluorescence and a narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap.







Abstract
The design and synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;doped aromatic belts with conjugated structures still remain a challenge. Here, we report the first nitrogen&#8208;doped aromatic belt with a [6]cycloparaphenylene skeleton, which is conveniently synthesized from the easily available calix[3]carbazole. The aromatic belt has a rigid conjugated structure and deep cavity, and it can encapsulate one dichloromethane both in solution and in the solid state. Interestingly, the aromatic belt shows strong green fluorescence with a quantum yield of 0.39 and exhibits a narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap of 2.02&#8197;eV. The belt&#8208;shaped conjugated structure composed of three carbazole subunits has specific optoelectronic properties that will promote wide applications in supramolecular chemistry and materials science.

         <title>High&#8208;Spin Imido Cobalt Complexes with Imidyl Radical Character**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15376-15380, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Syntheses and structures of rare trigonal, high&#8208;spin imido cobalt complexes are presented, which have very long Co&#8722;N bonds. Comprehensive spectroscopic studies reveal a radical imidyl character of the imide unit. Computational analyses corroborate these findings and show that the high&#8208;spin state is responsible for the imidyl radical character. The imido cobalt complexes are able to mediate intra&#8208; or intermolecular C&#8722;H bond activation.







Abstract
We report on the synthesis of a variety of trigonal imido cobalt complexes [Co(NAryl)L2]&#8722;, (L=N(Dipp)SiMe3), Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) with very long Co&#8722;NAryl bonds of around 1.75&#8197;&#197;. Their electronic structure was interrogated using a variety of physical and spectroscopic methods such as EPR or X&#8208;Ray absorption spectroscopy which leads to their description as highly unusual imidyl cobalt complexes. Computational analyses corroborate these findings and further reveal that the high&#8208;spin state is responsible for the imidyl character. Exchange of the Dipp substituent on the imide by the smaller mesityl function (2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl) effectuates the unexpected Me3Si shift from the ancillary ligand set to the imidyl nitrogen, revealing a highly reactive, nucleophilic character of the imidyl unit.

The low&#8208;temperature performances of zinc&#8211;air batteries are systematically investigated from both theoretical and experimental aspects in terms of feasibility verification, bottleneck analysis, and promotion strategies.







Abstract
Efficient energy storage at low temperatures starves for competent battery techniques. Herein, inherent advantages of zinc&#8211;air batteries on low&#8208;temperature electrochemical energy storage are discovered. The electrode reactions are resistive against low temperatures to render feasible working zinc&#8211;air batteries under sub&#8208;zero temperatures. The relatively reduced ionic conductivity of electrolyte is identified as the main limiting factor, which can be addressed by employing a CsOH&#8208;based electrolyte through regulating the solvation structures. Accordingly, 500&#8197;cycles with a stable voltage gap of 0.8&#8197;V at 5.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is achieved at &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C. This work reveals the promising potential of zinc&#8211;air batteries for low&#8208;temperature electrochemical energy storage and inspires advanced battery systems under extreme working conditions.

Co/organophotoredox dual catalysis allows the stereocontrolled synthesis of 1,3&#8208;diol products featuring quaternary carbon centers using vinyl cyclic carbonates and aldehydes as reaction partners. This streamlined method offers a wide scope of syn&#8208;configured products obtained under mild operating conditions, and control reactions suggest that diastereocontrol is exerted within a Zimmerman&#8211;Traxler type transition state.







Abstract
An efficient and attractive Co/organophotoredox dual catalysis protocol has been developed allowing the stereoselective access to a wide variety of syn&#8208;configured 1,3&#8208;diols featuring quaternary carbon centers. The synthesis of the target molecules is achieved under ambient reaction conditions using modular and accessible reagents, substituted vinyl cyclic carbonates and aldehydes, and in short reaction times. Mechanistic control experiments suggest that the stereoselectivity can be rationalized via a preferred Zimmerman&#8211;Traxler transition state comprising a Co(allyl) species and an activated aldehyde. This newly developed process thus expands the use of base metal catalysis in the construction of challenging quaternary carbon stereocenters.

         <title>Stabilization of an Enantiopure Sub&#8208;monolayer of Helicene Radical Cations on a Au(111) Surface through Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15276-15280, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy based on noncovalent interactions has been developed to deposit a sub&#8208;monolayer of enantiopure thia[4]helicene radical cations on a pre&#8208;functionalized Au(111) substrate. This approach results in both the paramagnetic character and the chirality of the molecules being retained at the nanoscale.







Abstract
In the past few years, the chirality and magnetism of molecules have received notable interest for the development of novel molecular devices. Chiral helicenes combine both these properties, and thus their nanostructuration is the first step toward developing new multifunctional devices. Here, we present a novel strategy to deposit a sub&#8208;monolayer of enantiopure thia[4]helicene radical cations on a pre&#8208;functionalized Au(111) substrate. This approach results in both the paramagnetic character and the chemical structure of these molecules being maintained at the nanoscale, as demonstrated by in&#8208;house characterizations. Furthermore, synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray natural circular dichroism confirmed that the handedness of the thia[4]helicene is preserved on the surface.

Furthermore, synchrotron-based X-ray natural circular dichroism confirmed that the handedness of the thia[4]helicene is preserved on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Two&#8208;Pronged Pulmonary Gene Delivery Strategy: A Surface&#8208;Modified Fullerene Nanoparticle and a Hypotonic Vehicle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15225-15229, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetra(piperazino)fullerene (TPFE)&#8208;based nanoparticles (NPs), surface&#8208;coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG), were engineered. The PEGylation allows the NPs to avoid interactions with mucin glycoproteins and phagocytic uptake by macrophages. After the NPs access the target lung cells, a hypotonic vehicle solution enhances their endocytosis via the osmotically driven regulatory volume effect, thereby providing highly efficient transgene expression.







Abstract
Inhaled gene therapy poses a unique potential of curing chronic lung diseases, which are currently managed primarily by symptomatic treatments. However, it has been challenging to achieve therapeutically relevant gene transfer efficacy in the lung due to the presence of numerous biological delivery barriers. Here, we introduce a simple approach that overcomes both extracellular and cellular barriers to enhance gene transfer efficacy in the lung in&#8197;vivo. We endowed tetra(piperazino)fullerene epoxide (TPFE)&#8208;based nanoparticles with non&#8208;adhesive surface polyethylene glycol (PEG) coatings, thereby enabling the nanoparticles to cross the airway mucus gel layer and avoid phagocytic uptake by alveolar macrophages. In parallel, we utilized a hypotonic vehicle to facilitate endocytic uptake of the PEGylated nanoparticles by lung parenchymal cells via the osmotically driven regulatory volume decrease (RVD) mechanism. We demonstrate that this two&#8208;pronged delivery strategy provides safe, wide&#8208;spread and high&#8208;level transgene expression in the lungs of both healthy mice and mice with chronic lung diseases characterized by reinforced delivery barriers.

         <title>An Ion&#8208;In&#8208;Conjugation&#8208;Boosted Organic Semiconductor Gas Sensor Operating at High Temperature and Immune to Moisture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15328-15334, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust NO2 sensor device based on an ion&#8208;in&#8208;conjugation structure maintained its performance at high temperature, which counteracted the effects of humidity (see picture; NO2 blue/red, H2O green/yellow). Charge transfer between NO2 and the chemiresistor was more efficient at 100&#8201;&#176;C than at room temperature. The fabricated sensor had a parts&#8208;per&#8208;billion (ppb) NO2 detection limit and showed the highest sensitivity of all reported NO2 chemiresistive sensors.







Abstract
Organic electrical gas sensors have been developed for many decades because of their high sensitivity and selectivity. However, their industrialization is severely hindered by their intrinsic humidity susceptibility and poor recovery. Conventional organic sensory materials can only operate at room temperature owing to their weak intermolecular interactions. Herein, we demonstrate using a croconate polymer (poly&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;biphenylcroconate) that the &#8220;ion&#8208;in&#8208;conjugation&#8221; concept enables organic gas sensors to operate at 100&#8201;&#176;C and 70&#8201;% relative humidity with almost complete recovery. The fabricated sensor had a parts&#8208;per&#8208;billion (ppb) detection limit for NO2 and showed the highest sensitivity (2526&#8197;ppm&#8722;1 at 40&#8197;ppb) of all reported NO2 chemiresistive sensors. Furthermore, charge transfer increased with temperature. Theoretical calculations and in situ FTIR spectra confirmed the ion&#8208;in&#8208;conjugation&#8208;inspired hydrogen bond as key for excellent sensitivity. A NO2 alarm system was assembled to demonstrate the feasibility of this sensor.

         <title>Diethynyl Phosphinates for Cysteine&#8208;Selective Protein Labeling and Disulfide Rebridging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15359-15364, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diethynyl phosphonites were found to react specifically with two thiols in aqueous buffer to give constructs that are stable under physiological conditions. This enables the facile generation of protein (double)&#8208;conjugates. Moreover, these molecules can be used to rebridge the interchain disulfides of therapeutic IgG antibodies.







Abstract
Diethynyl phosphinates were developed as bisfunctional electrophiles for the site&#8208;selective modification of peptides, proteins and antibodies. One of their electron&#8208;deficient triple bonds reacts selectively with a thiol and positions an electrophilic moiety for a subsequent intra&#8208; or intermolecular reaction with another thiol. The obtained conjugates were found to be stable in human plasma and in the presence of small thiols. We further demonstrate that this method is suitable for the generation of functional protein conjugates for intracellular delivery. Finally, this reagent class was used to generate functional homogeneously rebridged antibodies that remain specific for their target. Their modular synthesis, thiol selectivity and conjugate stability make diethynyl phosphinates ideal candidates for protein conjugation for biological and pharmaceutical applications.

         <title>Cucurbituril&#8208;Encapsulating Metal&#8211;Organic Framework via Mechanochemistry: Adsorbents with Enhanced Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15365-15370, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemistry has been applied to achieve one&#8208;pot fabrication of monolithic decamethylcucurbit[5]uril (MC5)&#8208;encapsulating metal&#8211;organic frameworks. The designed MC5@MIL&#8208;100(Fe) hybrid material with MC5 as active domains shows enhanced uptake, and selective capture of lead(II) cations at low concentrations. This work opens up the novel possibility of designing task&#8208;specific porous host&#8211;guest hybrid materials on a macroscopic scale.







Abstract
The first examples of monolithic crystalline host&#8211;guest hybrid materials are described. The reaction of 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylic acid (H3BTC) and Fe(NO3)3&#8901;9&#8201;H2O in the presence of decamethylcucurbit[5]uril ammonium chloride (MC5&#8901;2&#8201;NH4Cl&#8901;4&#8201;H2O) directly affords MC5@MIL&#8208;100(Fe) hybrid monoliths featuring hierarchical micro&#8208;, meso&#8208; and macropores. Particularly, this &#8220;bottle&#8208;around&#8208;ship&#8221; synthesis and one&#8208;pot shaping are facilitated by a newly discovered Fe&#8208;MC5 flowing gel formed by mechanochemistry. The designed MC5@MIL&#8208;100(Fe) hybrid material with MC5 as active domains shows enhanced CH4 and lead(II) uptake performance, and selective capture of lead(II) cations at low concentrations. This shows that host&#8211;guest hybrid materials can exhibit synergic properties that out&#8208;perform materials based on individual components.

A class of electroluminescence films based on a purely organic phosphor sensitizing fluorescence emitter were developed. A series of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP)&#8208;sensitized fluorescent materials with the capacity to break the limitation of 25&#8201;% internal quantum efficiency (IQE) for normal electrofluorescence devices was constructed.







Abstract
Pure organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials are considered as potential candidates for replacing precious metal complexes to fabricate highly efficient organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs). However, applications of the reported RTP materials in OLEDs are seriously impeded by their low photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) in a thin film state. To overcome these obstacles, we established a new strategy to construct highly efficient OLEDs based on a pure organic RTP material sensitized fluorescence emitter by selecting benzimidazole&#8208;triazine molecules (PIM&#8208;TRZ), 2,6&#8208;di(phenothiazinyl)naphthalene (&#946;&#8208;DPTZN), and 5,6,11,12&#8208;tetraphenylnaphthacene (rubrene) as host, phosphor sensitizer, and fluorescent emitter, respectively. The perfect combination of host, phosphorescent sensitizer, and fluorescent emitter in the emitting layer ensure the outstanding performance of the devices with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 15.7&#8201;%.

         <title>1,1,2&#8208;Ethenetriol: The Enol of Glycolic Acid, a High&#8208;Energy Prebiotic Molecule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15313-15316, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The simple yet uncharacterized high energy tautomer of glycolic acid, namely 1,1,2&#8208;ethenetriol, an important molecule in the abiotic synthesis of sugar acids, has now been identified by IR and UV/Vis spectroscopy. With these data now in hand, it now awaits its identification in space as another building block for prebiotic chemistry.







Abstract
As low&#8208;temperature conditions (e.g. in space) prohibit reactions requiring large activation energies, an alternative mechanism for follow&#8208;up transformations of highly stable molecules involves the reactions of higher energy isomers that were generated in a different environment. Hence, one working model for the formation of larger organic molecules is their generation from high&#8208;lying isomers of otherwise rather stable molecules. As an example, we present here the synthesis as well as IR and UV/Vis spectroscopic identification of the previously elusive 1,1,2&#8208;ethenetriol, the higher energy enol tautomer of glycolic acid, a rather stable and hence unreactive biological building block. The title compound was generated in the gas phase by flash vacuum pyrolysis of tartronic acid at 400&#8201;&#176;C and was subsequently trapped in argon matrices at 10&#8197;K. The spectral assignments are supported by B3LYP/6&#8211;311++G(2d,2p) computations. Upon photolysis at &#955;=180&#8211;254&#8197;nm, 1,1,2&#8208;ethenetriol rearranges to glycolic acid and ketene.

         <title>Molybdenum&#8208;Catalyzed Deoxygenative Cyclopropanation of 1,2&#8208;Dicarbonyl or Monocarbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15254-15259, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Readily available and bench&#8208;stable 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds are shown to undergo Mo&#8208;catalyzed regiospecific deoxygenative cyclopropanation. This method has led to an array of valuable cyclopropanes in yields of up to 90&#8201;% and with exclusive regioselectivity. This strategy was further applied to the cyclopropanation of a simple monocarbonyl compound.







Abstract
The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation of alkenes by the decomposition of diazo compounds is a powerful and straightforward strategy to produce cyclopropanes, but is tempered by the potentially explosive nature of diazo substrates. Herein we report the Mo&#8208;catalyzed regiospecific deoxygenative cyclopropanation of readily available and bench&#8208;stable 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds, in which one of the two carbonyl groups acts as a carbene equivalent upon deoxygenation and engages in the subsequent cyclopropanation process. The use of a commercially available Mo catalyst afforded an array of valuable cyclopropanes with exclusive regioselectivity in up to 90&#8201;% yield. The synthetic utility of this method was further demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale syntheses, late&#8208;stage functionalization, and the cyclopropanation of a simple monocarbonyl compound. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that phosphine (or silane) acts as both a mild reductant and a good oxygen acceptor that efficiently regenerates the catalytically active Mo catalyst through reduction of the Mo&#8208;oxo complexes.

Appropriate and simultaneous activation of robust and easy to handle [Tol&#8208;BINAP]NiCl2 and aromatic aldehydes with TIPSOTf orchestrates a direct, asymmetric, and catalytic aldol reaction of a wide array of N&#8208;acyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;thiazinane&#8208;2&#8208;thiones. This method enables the corresponding TIPS&#8208;protected anti aldol adducts to be obtained in a highly efficient and atom economical manner.







Abstract
A direct and asymmetric aldol reaction of N&#8208;acyl thiazinanethiones with aromatic aldehydes catalyzed by chiral nickel(II) complexes is reported. The reaction gives the corresponding O&#8208;TIPS&#8208;protected anti&#8208;aldol adducts in high yields and with remarkable stereocontrol and atom economy. Furthermore, the straightforward removal of the achiral scaffold provides enantiomerically pure intermediates of synthetic interest, which involve precursors for anti&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dihydroxy carboxylic derivatives. Theoretical calculations explain the observed high stereocontrol.

         <title>Facilitating the Ferration of Aromatic Substrates through Intramolecular Sodium Mediation</title>

         <dc:description>
Combining iron with sodium in tris(amido) complexes has led to the selective ferration of non&#8208;activated arenes being accomplished. A new cooperative mechanism is disclosed, whereby the sodium performs the metal&#8208;H exchange and this is followed by a fast intramolecular trans&#8208;metal trapping of the aryl anion by the iron centre.







Abstract
Exploiting cooperative effects between Na and FeII centres present in tris(amide) ferrate complexes has led to the chemoselective ferration of pentafluorobenzene, benzene, toluene, anisole, and pyridine being realised at room temperature. The importance of this bimetallic partnership is demonstrated by neither the relevant sodium amide (NaHMDS or NaTMP) nor the FeII amide Fe(HMDS)2 efficiently metallating these substrates under the conditions of this study. By combining NMR studies with the isolation of key intermediates and DFT calculations, we offer a possible mechanism for how these reactions take place, uncovering a surprising reaction pathway in which the metals cooperate in a synchronised manner. Although the isolated products are formally the result of Fe&#8208;H exchange, theoretical calculations indicate that the aromatic substrates undergo Na&#8208;H exchange followed by fast intramolecular transmetallation to Fe, thus stabilizing the newly generated aryl fragment.

Silica scaffold with single&#8208;diamond&#8208;surface networks has been synthesized via self&#8208;assembly of the triblock terpolymer and inorganic source. The structural transition and the fluctuations of the Gaussian curvature are the key for the formation of the single&#8208;diamond structure.







Abstract
Biological scaffolds with hyperbolic surfaces, especially single gyroid and single&#8208;diamond structures, have sparked immense interest for creating novel materials due to their extraordinary physical properties. However, the ability of nature to create these unbalanced surfaces has not been achieved in either lyotropic liquid crystals or block copolymer phases due to their thermodynamical instability in these systems. Here, we report the synthesis of a porous silica scaffold with a single&#8208;diamond&#8208;surface structure fabricated by self&#8208;assembly of the poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;b&#8208;polystyrene&#8208;b&#8208;poly(L&#8208;lactide) and silica precursors in a mixed solvent of tetrahydrofuran and water. The single&#8208;diamond structure with tetrahedral interconnected frameworks was revealed by the electron crystallographic reconstruction. We assume that the formation of single networks is induced by the structural transition and related to the energetic change due to the fluctuations of the Gaussian curvature. This work may provide new insights into these biologically relevant surfaces and related self&#8208;assembly systems.

         <title>Deracemization of Carbohelicenes by a Chiral Perylene Bisimide Cyclophane Template Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15323-15327, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inherently chiral perylene bisimide cyclophane has been synthesized that shows high binding affinities for carbohelicene guests in organic solvents. The perfect shape complementarity of the host&#8211;guest system was utilized for the deracemization of conformationally labile [4]&#8208; and [5]&#8208;helicenes.







Abstract
Deracemization describes the conversion of a racemic mixture of a chiral molecule into an enantioenriched mixture or an enantiopure compound without structural modifications. Herein, we report an inherently chiral perylene bisimide (PBI) cyclophane whose chiral pocket is capable of transforming a racemic mixture of [5]&#8208;helicene into an enantioenriched mixture with an enantiomeric excess of 66&#8201;%. UV/Vis and fluorescence titration studies reveal this cyclophane host composed of two helically twisted PBI dyes has high binding affinities for the respective homochiral carbohelicene guests, with outstanding binding constants of up to 3.9&#215;1010&#8197;m&#8722;1 for [4]&#8208;helicene. 2D NMR studies and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis demonstrate that the observed strong and enantioselective binding of homochiral carbohelicenes and the successful template&#8208;catalyzed deracemization of [5]&#8208;helicene can be explained by the enzyme&#8208;like perfect shape complementarity of the macrocyclic supramolecular host.

         <title>Selectivity and Targeting of G&#8208;Quadruplex Binders Activated by Adaptive Binding and Controlled by Chemical Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15340-15343, July 5, 2021. </description>

A PtII compound was synthesized and adaptively bound G&#8208;quadruplex DNA through kinetic control. The solution structure of the complex was solved. It was further proved that the compound can target G&#8208;quadruplex in living cells, repress VEGF expression in cancer cells and inhibit blood vessels growth in zebrafish.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) are prevalent in oncogenes and are potential antitumor drug targets. However, binding selectivity of compounds to G4s still faces challenges. Herein, we report a platinum(II) complex (Pt1), whose affinity to G4&#8208;DNA is activated by adaptive binding and selectivity controlled by binding kinetics. The resolved structure of Pt1/VEGF&#8208;G4 (a promoter G4) shows that Pt1 matches 3&#8242;&#8208;G&#8208;tetrad of VEGF&#8208;G4 through Cl&#8722;&#8208;dissociation and loop rearrangement of VEGF&#8208;G4. Binding rate constants are determined by coordination bond breakage/formation, correlating fully with affinities. The selective rate&#8208;determining binding step, Cl&#8722;&#8208;dissociation upon G4&#8208;binding, is 2&#8211;3 orders of magnitude higher than dsDNA. Pt1 potently targets G4 in living cells, effectively represses VEGF expression, and inhibits vascular growth in zebrafish. We show adaptive G4&#8208;binding activation and controlled by kinetics, providing a complementary design principle for compounds targeting G4 or similar biomolecules.

Mixed&#8208;valence compounds were investigated as novel polarizing agents for DNP NMR. These compounds constitute a group of molecules in which molecular mobility persists even in solids. Consequently, they can be used to perform Overhauser&#8208;DNP NMR experiments in solid state, and they specifically show favorable properties for applications at ultra&#8208;high magnetic fields (DNP=dynamic nuclear polarization, NMR=nuclear magnetic resonance).

         <title>Controllable Cu0&#8208;Cu+ Sites for Electrocatalytic Reduction of Carbon Dioxide</title>

Controllable Cu0&#8208;Cu+ pairs derived from the well&#8208;dispersed cupric oxide supported on copper phyllosilicate lamella can break thermodynamic and kinetic limitations of CO2 reduction reaction and achieve the superior CO2 electroreduction performance.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts facilitate CO2 electrochemical reduction (CO2ER) to produce multi&#8208;carbon products. However, the roles of Cu0 and Cu+ and the mechanistic understanding remain elusive. This paper describes the controllable construction of Cu0&#8208;Cu+ sites derived from the well&#8208;dispersed cupric oxide particles supported on copper phyllosilicate lamella to enhance CO2ER performance. 20&#8201;% Cu/CuSiO3 shows the superior CO2ER performance with 51.8&#8201;% C2H4 Faraday efficiency at &#8722;1.1&#8197;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode during the 6&#8197;hour test. In situ attenuated total reflection infrared spectra and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to elucidate the reaction mechanism. The enhancement in CO2ER activity is mainly attributed to the synergism of Cu0&#8208;Cu+ pairs: Cu0 activates CO2 and facilitates the following electron transfers; Cu+ strengthens *CO adsorption to further boost C&#8722;C coupling. We provide a strategy to rationally design Cu&#8208;based catalysts with viable valence states to boost CO2ER.

The enhancement in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ER activity is mainly attributed to the synergism of Cu&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;-Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; pairs: Cu&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; activates CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and facilitates the following electron transfers; Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; strengthens *CO adsorption to further boost C&#8722;C coupling. We provide a strategy to rationally design Cu-based catalysts with viable valence states to boost CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ER.&lt;/p&gt;

Unexpected oxygen&#8208;coordinated metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (Fe&#8208;, Co&#8208;, Ni&#8208;, Mn&#8208;SACs) with high loadings (above 10&#8197;wt&#8201;%) through direct transformation of metal oxide nanoparticles (Fe&#8208;, Co&#8208;, Ni&#8208;, Mn&#8208;NPs) in an inert atmosphere are directly observed.







Abstract
Direct conversion of bulk metal or nanoparticles into metal single atoms under thermal pyrolysis conditions is a highly efficient and promising strategy to fabricate single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). Usually, nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon is used as the anchoring substrate to capture the migrating metal ion species at high temperatures, and stable isolated SACs with nitrogen coordination are formed during the process. Herein, we report unexpected oxygen&#8208;coordinated metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (Fe&#8208;, Co&#8208;, Ni&#8208;, Mn&#8208;SACs) with high loadings (above 10&#8197;wt&#8201;%) through direct transformation of metal oxide nanoparticles (Fe&#8208;, Co&#8208;, Ni&#8208;, Mn&#8208;NPs) in an inert atmosphere at 750&#8201;&#176;C for 2&#8197;h. The atomic dispersion of metal single atoms and their coordinated structures were confirmed by aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption fine structures. In addition, the dynamic process of nanoparticles to atoms was directly observed by in&#8197;situ transmission electron microscopy. The as&#8208;prepared Fe SAC exhibited high activity and superior selectivity for catalytic oxidation of benzene to phenol with hydrogen peroxide.

         <title>Electrochemical Measurements Reveal Reactive Oxygen Species in Stress Granules**

Arsenite&#8208;induced stress granules isolated from both non&#8208;cancer and cancer cells contain reactive oxygen species as revealed by amperometric measurements with Pt or platinized carbon microelectrodes. This finding supports a role for SGs as signaling hubs and unveils a correlation between SG biology and pathogenesis in neurodegenerative diseases and some cancers.







Abstract
Stress granules (SGs) are membrane&#8208;less organelles that assemble in the cytoplasm to organize cellular contents and promote rapid adaptation during stress. To understand how SGs contribute to physiological functions, we used electrochemical measurements to detect electroactive species in SGs. With amperometry, we discovered that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are encapsulated inside arsenite&#8208;induced SGs, and H2O2 is the main species. The release kinetics of H2O2 from single SGs and the number of H2O2 molecules were quantified. The discovery that SGs contain ROS implicates them as communicators of the cellular stresses rather than a simple endpoint. This may explain how SGs regulate cellular metabolism and stress responses. This may also help better understand their cytoprotective functions in pathological conditions associated with SGs such as neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), cancers and viral infections.

         <title>Small Exciton Binding Energies Enabling Direct Charge Photogeneration Towards Low&#8208;Driving&#8208;Force Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15348-15353, July 5, 2021. </description>

Direct photogeneration of free charge carriers enabled by remarkably low exciton binding energies is demonstrated in the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art nonfullerene acceptor of Y6 by a joint experimental and theoretical study. This results in efficient charge generation under small interfacial energy offsets in the high&#8208;efficiency nonfullerene organic solar cells.







Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) with nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) exhibit efficient charge generation under small interfacial energy offsets, leading to over 18&#8201;% efficiency for the single&#8208;junction devices based on the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NFA of Y6. Herein, to reveal the underlying charge generation mechanisms, we have investigated the exciton binding energy (Eb) in Y6 by a joint theoretical and experimental study. The results show that owing to strong charge polarization effects, Y6 has remarkable small Eb of &#8722;0.11&#8211;0.15&#8197;eV, which is even lower than perovskites in many cases. Moreover, it is peculiar that the photoluminescence is enhanced with temperature, and the energy barrier for separating excitons into charges is evidently lower than the thermal energy according to the temperature dependence of photoluminescence, manifesting direct photogeneration of charge carriers enabled by weak Eb in Y6. Thus, charge generation in NFA&#8208;based OSCs shows little dependence on interfacial driving forces.

         <title>Hydrogen Atom Transfer from HOO. to ortho&#8208;Quinones Explains the Antioxidant Activity of Polydopamine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15220-15224, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polydopamine, a melanin analogue, is an excellent trap for alkylperoxyl radicals (ROO., typically formed during autoxidation of lipid substrates) only in the presence of hydroperoxyl radicals (HOO.). Activation of the ortho&#8208;quinone moieties by HOO., and formation of exposed semiquinones are proposed as the reason of the peculiar antioxidant activity.







Abstract
Melanins are stable and non&#8208;toxic biomaterials with a great potential as chemopreventive agents for diseases connected with oxidative stress, but the mechanism of their antioxidant action is unclear. Herein, we show that polydopamine (PDA), a well&#8208;known synthetic melanin, becomes an excellent trap for alkylperoxyl radicals (ROO., typically formed during autoxidation of lipid substrates) in the presence of hydroperoxyl radicals (HOO.). The key reaction explaining this peculiar antioxidant activity is the reduction of the ortho&#8208;quinone moieties present in PDA by the reaction with HOO.. This reaction occurs via a H&#8208;atom transfer mechanism, as demonstrated by the large kinetic solvent effect of the reaction of a model quinone (3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;benzoquinone) with HOO. (k=1.5&#215;107 and 1.1&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in PhCl and MeCN). The chemistry disclosed herein is an important step to rationalize the redox&#8208;mediated bioactivity of melanins and of quinones.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Syntheses of Manginoids&#8197;A and&#8197;C and Guignardones&#8197;A and&#8197;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15286-15290, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective total syntheses of fungal meroterpenoids, manginoids&#8197;A and C, as well as guignardones&#8197;A and C, are accomplished. This divergent and bioinspired synthetic strategy involves a Csp3&#8722;Csp2 Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling of vinyl bromide, silica&#8208;gel&#8208;promoted semipinacol rearrangement, and oxidative 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl radical&#8208;initiated cyclization.







Abstract
An enantioselective synthetic approach for preparing manginoids and guignardones, two types of biogenetically related meroterpenoids, is reported. This bioinspired and divergent synthesis employs an oxidative 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl radical&#8208;initiated cyclization and cyclodehydration of the common precursor to forge the central ring of the manginoids and guignardones, respectively, at a late stage. Key synthetic steps include silica&#8208;gel&#8208;promoted semipinacol rearrangement to form the 6&#8208;oxabicyclo[3.2.1]octane skeleton and the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reaction of vinyl bromide to achieve fragment coupling. This synthesis protocol enables the asymmetric syntheses of four fungal meroterpenoids from commercially available materials.

         <title>Hierarchical Two&#8208;Level Supramolecular Chirality of an Achiral Anthracene&#8208;Based Tetracationic Nanotube in Water</title>

Host&#8211;guest complexation with nucleoside triphosphates in water has led to an achiral anthracene&#8208;based tetracationic nanotube showing two levels of supramolecular chirality. This nanotube, which can adopt M&#8208; and P&#8208;twisted conformations, exhibits adaptive chiral recognition with opposite CD spectra for ATP/GTP and CTP/UTP, and a strong excimer showing strong circularly polarized luminescence ((+)&#8208;CPL; glum&#8776;10&#8722;2) with ATP in water.







Abstract
Herein, we report an achiral anthracene&#8208;based tetracationic nanotube (1&#8901;4Cl&#8722;) that shows two levels of supramolecular chirality: namely, conformationally adaptive host&#8211;guest complexation with nucleoside triphosphates (e.g. ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP) and twisted packing of the chiral host&#8211;guest complexes in water. Interestingly, achiral 1&#8901;4Cl&#8722; exhibits chiral recognition for ATP/GTP and CTP/UTP through structural transformation of its intramolecular M&#8208; and P&#8208;twisted conformation as the first level of supramolecular chirality, which leads to adaptive chirality with opposite CD responses. Furthermore, the formation of chiral M&#8208;1&#8901;4Cl&#8722;&#8835;ATP can promote an intermolecular P&#8208;twisted dimeric packing of anthracene rings as the second level of supramolecular chirality to achieve assembled chirality with strong circularly polarized luminescence arising from the excimer ((+)&#8208;CPL, glum&#8776;10&#8722;2) in water.

         <title>Structural basis for isomerization reactions in fungal tetrahydroxanthone biosynthesis and diversification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The novel isomerase NsrQ, from&#160;  Aspergillus novofumigatus,  &#160;is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of fungal tetrahydroxanthones and responsible for the dearomatizing cyclization to provide the tetrahydroxanthone scaffold. NsrQ catalyzes a two step isomerization reaction, involving the isomerization of allylic alcohol and subsequent inversion of configuration at&#160;the methyl group. Here, we report the biochemical and structural characterizations of NsrQ and its homologue Dcr3, from&#160;  Diaporthe longicolla.&#160;  The crystal structures of NsrQ and Dcr3 revealed their similar overall structures, with a cone&#8208;shaped &#945;+&#946; barrel fold, to those of the NTF2&#8208;like superfamily enzymes. Furthermore, the structures of Dcr3 and NsrQ variants complexed with substrate analogues and the site&#8208;directed mutagenesis studies identified the catalytic residues and the important hydrophobic residues in shaping the active site pocket for substrate binding. These enzymes thus utilize Glu and His residues as acid&#8208;base catalysts. Based on these observations, we proposed the detailed reaction mechanism of NsrQ&#8208;catalyzed isomerization reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Thionitrite and Perthionitrite in NO Signaling at Zinc</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NO and H2S serve as signaling molecules in biology with intertwined reactivity. HSNO and HSSNO with their conjugate bases  &#8208;SNO and  &#8208;SSNO form in the reaction of H2S with NO as well as  S&#8208;nitrosothiols (RSNO) and nitrite (NO2&#8208;) that serve as NO reservoirs. While the elusive nature of HSNO and HSSNO renders their study challenging, their conjugate bases form isolable zinc complexes  Ph,MeTpZn(SNO) and  Ph,MeTpZn(SSNO) supported by tris(pyrazolyl)borate ligands. Reaction of Na(15&#8208;C&#8208;5)SSNO with  Ph,MeTpZn(ClO4) provides  Ph,MeTpZn(SSNO) that undergoes S&#8208;atom removal by PEt  3  to give  Ph,MeTpZn(SNO) and S=PEt3. Unexpectedly stable at room temperature, these Zn&#8208;SNO and Zn&#8208;SSNO complexes release NO upon heating.  Ph,MeTpZn(SNO) and  Ph,MeTpZn(SSNO) quickly react with acidic thiols such as C6F5SH to form N2O and NO, respectively. Increasing the thiol basicity in p&#8208;substituted aromatic thiols  4&#8208;XArSH in the reaction with  Ph,MeTpZn(SNO) turns on competing  S&#8208;nitrosation to form  Ph,MeTpZn&#8208;SH and RSNO, the latter a known precursor for NO.</dc:description>

         <title>Are All Single Atoms Created Equal? Surface Density Dependent Catalytic Activity of Single Pd Atoms Supported on Ceria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The analogy between single atom catalysts (SACs) and molecular catalysts predicts that the specific catalytic activity of these systems is constant. We provide evidence that this prediction is not necessarily true. As a case in point, we show that the specific activity over ceria&#8208;supported single Pd atoms linearly increases with metal atom density, originating from the cumulative enhancement of CeO  2  reducibility. The long&#8208;range electrostatic footprints (~1.5 nm) around each Pd site overlap with each other as surface Pd density increases, resulting in the observed deviation from constant specific activity. These cooperative effects exhaust previously active O atoms above a certain Pd density, leading to their permanent removal and consequent drop in reaction rate. The findings of our combined experimental and computational study show that the specific catalytic activity of reducible oxide&#8208;supported single atom catalysts can be tuned by varying the surface density of single metal atoms.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding and Engineering the Stereoselectivity of Humulene Synthase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The non&#8208;canonical terpene cyclase AsR6 is responsible for the formation of 2E,6E,9E&#8208;humulene during the biosynthesis of the tropolone sesquiterpenoid (TS) xenovulene A. The structures of unliganded AsR6 and of AsR6 in complex with an in crystallo cyclized reaction product and thiolodiphosphate reveal a new farnesyl diphosphate binding motif that comprises a unique binuclear Mg2+cluster and an essential K289 residue that is conserved in all humulene synthases involved in TS formation. Structure&#8208;based sitedirected mutagenesis of AsR6 and its homologue EupR3 identify a single residue, L285/M261, that controls the production of either 2E,6E,9E&#8208; or 2Z,6E,9E&#8208;humulene. A possible mechanism for the observed stereoselectivity was investigated using different isoprenoid precursors and results demonstrate that M261 has gatekeeping control over product formation.</dc:description>

Structure-based sitedirected mutagenesis of AsR6 and its homologue EupR3 identify a single residue, L285/M261, that controls the production of either 2E,6E,9E- or 2Z,6E,9E-humulene. A possible mechanism for the observed stereoselectivity was investigated using different isoprenoid precursors and results demonstrate that M261 has gatekeeping control over product formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biomimetic iron complex achieves TET enzyme reactivity**</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The epigenetic marker 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxycytidine (5mdC) is the most prevalent modification to DNA. It is removed inter alia via an active demethylation pathway: oxidation by Ten&#8208;Eleven Translocation 5&#8208;methyl cytosine dioxygenase (TET) and subsequent removal via base excision repair or direct demodification. Recently, we have shown that the synthetic iron(IV)&#8208;oxo complex [FeIV(O)(Py5Me2H)]2+ (1) can serve as a biomimetic model for TET by oxidizing the nucleobase 5&#8208;methyl cytosine (5mC) to its natural metabolites. In this work, we demonstrate that nucleosides and even short oligonucleotide strands can also serve as substrates, using a range of HPLC and MS techniques. We found that the 5&#8208;position of 5mC is oxidized preferably by 1, with side reactions occurring only at the strand ends of the used oligonucleotides. A detailed study of the reactivity of 1 towards nucleosides confirms our results; that oxidation of the anomeric center (1&#8217;) is the most common side reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Materials Engineering of Violin Soundboards by Stradivari and Guarneri</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ICP&#8208;MS is used to identify the unique mineral recipe used by Antonio Stradivari to treat his spruce wood, the material for the violin top plate. Chemical manipulation led to hemicellulose fragmentation and cellulose rearrangement. Incorporating engineered wood may contribute to the unique tonal qualities of these acclaimed instruments.







Abstract
We investigated the material properties of Cremonese soundboards using a wide range of spectroscopic, microscopic, and chemical techniques. We found similar types of spruce in Cremonese soundboards as in modern instruments, but Cremonese spruces exhibit unnatural elemental compositions and oxidation patterns that suggest artificial manipulation. Combining analytical data and historical information, we may deduce the minerals being added and their potential functions&#8212;borax and metal sulfates for fungal suppression, table salt for moisture control, alum for molecular crosslinking, and potash or quicklime for alkaline treatment. The overall purpose may have been wood preservation or acoustic tuning. Hemicellulose fragmentation and altered cellulose nanostructures are observed in heavily treated Stradivari specimens, which show diminished second&#8208;harmonic generation signals. Guarneri's practice of crosslinking wood fibers via aluminum coordination may also affect mechanical and acoustic properties. Our data suggest that old masters undertook materials engineering experiments to produce soundboards with unique properties.

         <title>On the Biology of Werner's Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Werner's Complex (WC) has hitherto unappreciated biological properties derived from its binding affinity to highly anionic biomolecules such as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and nucleic acids. In proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle it displays &#956;m antiviral activity against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) with promising selectivity. Exploitation of non&#8208;covalent interactions has motivated the unprecedented discovery of the properties of this iconic compound.







Abstract
Werner's Complex, as a cationic coordination complex (CCC), has hitherto unappreciated biological properties derived from its binding affinity to highly anionic biomolecules such as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and nucleic acids. Competitive inhibitor and spectroscopic assays confirm the high affinity to GAGs heparin, heparan sulfate (HS), and its pentasaccharide mimetic Fondaparinux (FPX). Functional consequences of this affinity include inhibition of FPX cleavage by bacterial heparinase and mammalian heparanase enzymes with inhibition of cellular invasion and migration. Werner's Complex is a very efficient condensing agent for DNA and tRNA. In proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle for translational implications, it is demonstrated to display antiviral activity against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) at micromolar concentrations with promising selectivity. Exploitation of non&#8208;covalent hydrogen&#8208;bonding and electrostatic interactions has motivated the unprecedented discovery of these properties, opening new avenues of research for this iconic compound.

         <title>Synthetic Zippers as an Enabling Tool for Engineering of Non&#8208;Ribosomal Peptide Synthetases**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Re&#8208;engineering of non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) is challenging due to their protein size up to a few megadalton. The artificial splitting of NRPSs to produce building blocks with moderate size is achieved by the introduction of synthetic zippers, which can be recombined in a rapid and simple plug and play manner to form an in trans regulated synthetic type of NRPSs.







Abstract
Non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are the origin of a wide range of natural products, including many clinically used drugs. Efficient engineering of these often giant biosynthetic machineries to produce novel non&#8208;ribosomal peptides (NRPs) is an ongoing challenge. Here we describe a cloning and co&#8208;expression strategy to functionally combine NRPS fragments of Gram&#8208;negative and &#8208;positive origin, synthesising novel peptides at titres up to 220&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1. Extending from the recently introduced definition of eXchange Units (XUs), we inserted synthetic zippers (SZs) to split single protein NRPSs into independently expressed and translated polypeptide chains. These synthetic type of NRPS (type S) enables easier access to engineering, overcomes cloning limitations, and provides a simple and rapid approach to building peptide libraries via the combination of different NRPS subunits.

         <title>Programmable RNA N1&#8208;Methyladenosine Demethylation by a Cas13d&#8208;Directed Demethylase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tool for targeted m1A demethylation of specific cellular RNA without changing the primary sequence, termed &#8220;REMOVER&#8221;, was developed via combining the RNA&#8208;targeting capability of dCasRx (the catalytically inactive RNA&#8208;targeting RfxCas13d enzyme) and the RNA m1A demethylation property of ALKBH3. REMOVER enabled m1A demethylation of the specific RNA without obvious off&#8208;target effects.







Abstract
N1&#8208;methyladenosine (m1A) is a prevalent and reversible RNA modification, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of RNA fate and gene expression. However, the lack of tools to precisely manipulate m1A sites in specific transcripts has hindered efforts to clarify the association between a specific m1A&#8208;modified transcript and its phenotypic outcomes. Here we develop a CRISPR&#8208;Cas13d&#8208;based tool called reengineered m1A modification valid eraser (termed &#8220;REMOVER&#8221;) for targeted m1A demethylation of a specific transcript. The catalytically inactive RfxCas13d (dCasRx) is fused to the m1A demethylase ALKBH3, and the dCasRx&#8208;ALKBH3 fusion protein can mediate potent demethylation of m1A&#8208;modified RNAs. We further find that REMOVER can specifically demethylate m1A of MALAT1 and PRUNE1 RNAs, thereby significantly increasing their stability. Our study establishes REMOVER as a tool for targeted RNA demethylation of specific m1A&#8208;modified transcripts, which enables further elucidation of the relationship between m1A modification of specific transcripts and their phenotypic outcomes.

         <title>Cobalt Phthalocyanine Derived Molecular Isolation Layer for Highly Stable Lithium Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The uneven consumption of anions during the lithium (Li) deposition process triggers a space charge effect that generates Li dendrites, seriously hindering the practical application of Li metal batteries. Herein, we report on a cobalt phthalocyanine electrolyte additive with a planar molecular structure, which can be tightly adsorbed on the Li anode surface to form a dense molecular layer. Such a planar molecular layer can not only complex with Li ions to reduce the space charge effect, but also suppress side reactions between the anode and the electrolyte, producing a stable solid electrolyte interphase composed of amorphous LiF and LiCO  3  as verified by X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge spectroscopy. As a result, the Li|Li symmetric cell exhibits excellent cycling stability above 700 h under a high plating capacity of 3 mAh cm  &#8722;2  . Moreover, the assembled Li|LiFePO  4  full&#8208;cell can also deliver excellent cycling over 200 cycles under lean electrolyte conditions (3 &#181;L mg  &#8208;1  ).</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic Tailoring in Luzopeptin Biosynthesis Involves Cytochrome P450&#8208;Mediated Carbon&#8208;Nitrogen Bond Desaturation for Hydrazone Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Luzopeptins and related decadepsipeptides are bisintercalator nonribosomal peptides featuring rare acyl&#8208;substituted tetrahydropyridazine&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acid (Thp) subunits that are critical to their biological activities. Herein, we reconstitute the biosynthetic tailoring pathway in luzopeptin A biosynthesis through  in vivo  genetic and  in vitro  biochemical approaches. Significantly, we revealed a multitasking cytochrome P450 enzyme that catalyzes four consecutive oxidations including the highly unusual carbon&#8208;nitrogen bond desaturation, forming the hydrazone&#8208;bearing 4&#8208;OH&#8208;Thp residues. Moreover, we identified a membrane&#8208;bound acyltransferase that likely mediates the subsequent  O  &#8208;acetylations extracellularly, as a potential self&#8208;protective strategy for the producer strain. Further genome mining of novel decadepsipeptides and an associated P450 enzyme have provided mechanistic insights into the P450&#8208;mediated carbon&#8208;nitrogen bond desaturation. Our results not only reveal the molecular basis of pharmacophore formation in bisintercalator decadepsipeptides, but also expand the catalytic versatility of P450 family enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Luminescent Enhancement Triggered by One&#8208;shot Needlestick&#8208;stimulus Using a Liquescent Gold(I) Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Luminescence from a gold(I) complex with an  N  &#8208;heterocycliccarbene&#8208;based ligand,  1  +  &#8226;NTf  2  &#8211;  , increased rapidly upon the application of one&#8208;shot needlestick&#8208;stimulus. The weakly orange&#8208;emitting solid&#8208;state of  1  +  &#8226;NTf  2  &#8211;  was prepared by cooling its melted liquid to 90 &#176;C. Upon applying a weak pinpoint stimulus with a needle, this weakly orange&#8208;emitting solid state was transformed into an intensively violet&#8208;blue&#8208;emitting state on a timescale of seconds. The emission after applying the stimulus could be visualized upon UV excitation even under ambient room light. This sequential phase transition from a stable solid to a liquid and then to a metastable solid could occur repeatedly without any measurable degradation of the complex. Various shapes could be prepared by casting the liquid&#8208;state complex into molds of different designs. This rapid response is thought to be triggered by the flexible intermolecular interactions in the kinetically generated aggregates formed upon cooling the liquid state and by the strong Au&#8211;Au interactions in the thermodynamically stable crystals after applying the needlestick&#8208;stimulus.</dc:description>

         <title>Oligonucleotide Phosphorothioates Enter Cells by Thiol&#8208;Mediated Uptake</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oligonucleotide phosphorothioates (OPS) are DNA or RNA mimics where one phosphate oxygen is replaced by a sulfur atom.&#160; They have been shown to enter mammalian cells much more efficiently than non&#8208;modified DNA.&#160; Thus, solving one of the key challenges with oligonucleotide technology, OPS became very useful in practice, with several FDA&#8208;approved drugs on the market or in late clinical trials.&#160; However, the mechanism accounting for this facile cellular uptake is unknown.&#160; Here, we show that OPS enter cells by thiol&#8208;mediated uptake.&#160; The transient adaptive network produced dynamic&#8208;covalent pseudo&#8208;disulfide exchange is characterized in action.&#160; Inhibitors with nanomolar efficiency are provided, together with activators that reduce endosomal capture for efficient delivery of OPS into the cytosol, the site of action.</dc:description>

         <title>Tissue Fluid Triggered Enzyme Polymerization for Ultrafast Gelation and Cartilage Repair</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The  in&#8208;situ  gelation of injectable precursors is desirable in the field of tissue regeneration, especially in the context of irregular defect filling. The current driving forces for fast gelation include the phase&#8208;transition of thermally sensitive copolymers, click chemical reactions with tissue components, and metal coordination effect. However, the rapid formation of tough hydrogels remains a challenge. Inspired by aerobic metabolism, we herein propose a tissue&#8208;fluid&#8208;triggered cascade enzymatic polymerization process catalyzed by glucose oxidase and ferrous glycinate for the ultrafast gelation of acryloylated chondroitin sulfates and acrylamides. The highly efficient production of carbon radicals and macromolecules contribute to auto&#8208;accelerated polymerization for soft tissue augmentation in bone defects. The copolymer hydrogel demonstrated the regeneration&#8208;promoting capacity of cartilage. As the first example of using artificial enzyme complexes for  in&#8208;situ  polymerization, this work offers a biomimetic approach to the design of strength&#8208;adjustable hydrogels for bio&#8208;implanting and bio&#8208;printing applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Defect&#8208;Rich High&#8208;Entropy Oxides Nanosheets for Efficient 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs), a new concept of entropy stabilization, exhibit unique structures and fascinating properties, and are thus important class of materials with significant technological potential.&#160;However, the conventional high&#8208;temperature synthesis techniques tend to afford micron&#8208;scale HEOs with low surface area, and the catalytic activity of available HEOs is still far from satisfactory because of their limited exposed active sites and poor intrinsic activity. Here, we report a low&#8208;temperature plasma strategy for preparing defect&#8208;rich HEOs nanosheets with high surface area, and for the first time employ them as electrocatalysts for 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) electrooxidation. Owing to the nanosheets structure, abundant oxygen vacancies, and high surface area, the quinary (FeCrCoNiCu)  3  O  4  &#160;HEOs nanosheets deliver improved electrocatalytic activity for HMF oxidation with lower onset potential and faster kinetics, outperforming that of HEOs prepared by high&#8208;temperature method. Our methodology could not only open new opportunities for investigating the properties of HEOs, but also be applicable for the discovery of nanostructured materials with great potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoscale chemical imaging of supported lipid monolayers using Tip&#8208;enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visualizing the molecular organization of lipid membranes is essential to comprehend their biological functions.

In this work, we demonstrate the capability of tip&#8209;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) to probe the molecular organization of supported DPPC monolayers on Au (111), prepared using the Langmuir&#8208;Blodgett (LB) technique. High&#8208;quality TERS spectra were obtained, that permitted a direct correlation of the topography of the lipid monolayer with its TERS image for the first time.

This shows that a homogeneously transferred LB monolayer is heterogeneous at the nanoscale.&#160;&#160;Finally, the high sensitivity and spatial resolution down to 20 nm of TERS enabled reproducible, hyperspectral visualization of molecular disorder in the DPPC monolayers, demonstrating that TERS is a promising nanoanalytical tool to investigate the molecular organization of lipid membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting photocatalytic water oxidation over bifunctional Rh0&#8208;Rh3+ sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic water splitting provides an economically feasible way for converting solar energy into hydrogen. Great efforts have been devoted to developing efficient photocatalysts; however, the surface catalytic reactions, especially for the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER), still remains as a big challenge, which limits the overall photocatalytic energy efficiency. Here, we design a kind of Rhn cluster cocatalyst, with bifunctional Rh0&#8208;Rh3+ sites anchoring on the Mo&#8208;doped BiVO4 model photocatalytic system. The resultant photocatalyst enables a super high visible&#8208;light photocatalytic oxygen production activity of 7.11 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 and an apparent quantum efficiency of 29.37% at 420 nm. Besides, the turnover frequency (TOF) value of the excellent photocatalyst could achieve 416.73 h&#8208;1, which is 378 times higher than that of the photocatalyst only decorated with Rh3+ species. The experimental and theoretical results unambiguously demonstrate the existence of stable isolated Rhn cocatalyst with Rh0&#8208;Rh3+ sites, and the operando X&#8208;ray absorption characterization proves the OER process on the bifunctional Rh0&#8208;Rh3+ sites. The density functional theoretical calculations further illustrate a bifunctional OER mechanism over the Rh0&#8208;Rh3+ sites, in which the oxygen intermediate attacks the Rh3+ sites with assistance of a hydrogen atom transfer to the Rh0 sites, thus breaking the scaling relationship of various oxygen intermediates. This work demonstrates the potential of bifunctional Rh0&#8208;Rh3+ sites to circumvent the OER scaling relationship to construct high&#8208;performance photocatalysts or photoelectrodes.</dc:description>

         <title>The Copper Chaperone NosL forms a Heterometal Site for Cu Delivery to Nitrous Oxide Reductase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The final step of denitrification is the reduction of nitrous oxide (N  2  O) to N  2  , mediated by Cu&#8208;dependent nitrous oxide reductase (N  2  OR). Its metal centers, Cu  A  and Cu  Z  , are assembled through sequential provision of twelve Cu(I) ions by a metallochaperone that forms part of a  nos  gene cluster encoding the enzyme and its accessory factors. The chaperone is the  nosL  gene product, an 18 kDa lipoprotein predicted to reside in the outer membrane of Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. In order to better understand the assembly of N  2  OR, we have produced NosL from  Shewanella denitrificans  and determined the structure of the metal&#8208;loaded chaperone by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The protein assembled a hetero&#173;di&#173;nuclear metal site consisting of Zn(II) and Cu(I), as evidenced by anomalous X&#8208;ray scattering. While only Cu(I) is delivered to the enzyme, the stabilizing presence of Zn(II) is essential for the functionality and structural integrity of the chaperone.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiophene&#8208;based Conjugated Acetylenic Polymers with Dual Active Sites for Efficient Co&#8208;Catalyst&#8208;free Photoelectrochemical Water Reduction in Alkaline Medium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although being attractive materials for photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (PEC HER) under neutral or acidic conditions, conjugated polymers still show poor PEC HER performance in alkaline medium due to the lack of water dissociation sites. Herein, we demonstrate that tailoring the polymer skeleton from poly(diethynylthieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene) (pDET) to poly(2,6&#8208;diethynylbenzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8217;]dithiophene (pBDT) and poly(diethynyldithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2',3'&#8208;d]thiophene) (pDTT) in conjugated acetylenic polymers (CAPs) introduces highly efficient active sites for water dissociation. As a result, pDTT and pBDT, grown on Cu substrate, demonstrate benchmark photocurrent densities of 170 &#181;A cm&#8208;2 and 120 &#181;A cm&#8208;2 (at 0.3 V vs. RHE; pH 13), which are 4.2 and 3 times higher than that of pDET, respectively. Moreover, by combining DFT calculations and electrochemical operando resonance Raman spectroscopy, we propose that the electron&#8208;enriched C&#946; of the outer thiophene rings of pDTT are the water dissociation active sites, while the &#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208; bonds function as the active sites for hydrogen evolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding Catalysis with Telluronium Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chalcogen bonding results from non&#8208;covalent interaction occurring between electrodeficient chalcogen atoms and Lewis bases. Among the chalcogens, tellurium is the strongest Lewis acid but Te&#8208;based compounds are scarcely used as organocatalyst. For the first time, telluronium cations demonstrated impressive catalytic property at low loading in three benchmark reactions: the Friedel&#8208;Crafts bromination of anisole, the bromolactonization of &#969;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids and the aza&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder between Danishefsky&#8217;s diene and imines. The ability of telluronium cations to interact with a Lewis base through chalcogen bonding was demonstrated on the basis of multi&#8208;nuclear (  17  O,  31  P and  125  Te) NMR analysis and DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>A Chemistry and Microstructure Perspective on Ion Conducting Membranes for Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox flow batteries (RFBs) with decoupled control over power and energy are known as one of the most promising grid&#8208;scale energy storage technologies. However, the development of RFBs with high round&#8208;trip efficiency, high rate capability and long cycle life for practical applications is highly restricted by the lack of appropriate ion conducting membranes. Promising RFB membranes should separate positive and negative species completely and conduct balancing ions smoothly, and it is also critical to meet the additional requirements in specific systems, such as high chemical stability in corrosive electrolytes, good resistance to organic solvents in nonaqueous systems, and excellent mechanical strength and flexibility. These rigorous requirements put high demands on the membrane design, essentially the chemistry and microstructure associated with ion transport channels. In this review, we summarize the design rationale of recently reported RFB membranes at the molecular level, with the emphasis on the new chemistry, novel microstructure, and innovative fabrication strategy. Future challenges and potential research opportunities within this field are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Beam search for automated design and scoring of novel ROR ligands with machine intelligence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical language models enable de novo drug design without the requirement for explicit molecular construction rules. While such models have been applied to generate novel compounds with desired bioactivity, the actual prioritization and selection of the most promising computational designs remains challenging. In this work, we leveraged the probabilities learnt by chemical language models with the beam search algorithm as a model&#8208;intrinsic technique for automated molecule design and scoring. Prospective application of this method yielded three novel inverse agonists of retinoic acid receptor&#8208;related orphan receptors (RORs). Each design was synthesizable in three reaction steps and presented low&#8208;micromolar to nanomolar potency towards ROR&#947;. This model&#8208;intrinsic sampling technique eliminates the strict need for external compound scoring functions, thereby further extending the applicability of generative artificial intelligence to data&#8208;driven drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>An Organic&#8208;Inorganic Perovskitoid with Zwitterion Cysteamine Linker and Its Crystal&#8208;Crystal Transformation to Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Phase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate synthesis of a new low&#8208;D hybrid perovskitoid (a perovskite&#8208;like hybrid halide structure, yellow crystals, P21/n space group) using zwitterion cysteamine (2&#8208;aminoethanethiol) linker, and its remarkable molecular diffusion&#8208;controlled crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal transformation to Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper phase (Red crystals, Pnma space group). Our stable intermediate perovskitoid distinctly differs from all previous reports by way of a unique staggered arrangement of holes in the puckered 2D configuration with a face&#8208;sharing connection between the corrugated&#8208;1D double chains. The PL intensity for the yellow phase is 5 orders higher as compared to the red phase and the corresponding average lifetime is also fairly long (143 ns). First principles DFT calculations conform very well with the experimental band gap data. We demonstrate applicability of the new perovskitoid yellow phase as an excellent active layer in a self&#8208;powered photodetector and for selective detection of Ni2+ via On&#8208;Off&#8208;On photoluminescence (PL) based on its composite with few layer black phosphorous.</dc:description>

         <title>"Repaired and Activated" DNAzyme Enables the Monitoring of DNA Alkylation Repair in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct measurement of DNA repair is critical for the annotation of their clinical relevance and the discovery of drugs for cancer therapy.  Here we reported a "repaired and activated" DNAzyme (RADzyme) by incorporating a single methyl lesion (O  6  MeG, 3MeC, or 1MeA) at designated positions through systematic screening  . We found that the catalytic activity of the RADzyme was remarkably suppressed and could be restored via enzyme&#8208;mediated DNA repair. Benefit from these findings, a fluorogenic RADzyme sensor was developed for the monitoring of MGMT&#8208;mediated repair of O  6  MeG lesion. Importantly, the sensor allowed the evaluation of MGMT repair activity in different cells and under drugs treatment. Furthermore, another RADzyme sensor was engineered for the monitoring of ALKBH2&#8208;mediated repair of 3MeC lesion. This strategy provides a simple and versatile tool for the study of the basic biology of DNA repair, clinical diagnosis and therapeutic assessment.</dc:description>

         <title>Post&#8208;translational Formation of Aminomalonate by a Promiscuous Peptide&#8208;modifying Radical SAM Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aminomalonate (Ama) is a widespread structural motif in Nature, whereas its biosynthetic route is only partially understood. In this study, we show that a radical S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (rSAM) enzyme involved in cyclophane biosynthesis exhibits remarkable catalytic promiscuity. This enzyme, named three&#8208;residue cyclophane forming enzyme (3&#8208;CyFE), mainly produces cyclophane in vivo, whereas it produces formylglycine (FGly) as a major product and barely produce cyclophane in vitro. Importantly, the enzyme can further oxidize FGly to produce Ama. Bioinformatics study revealed that 3&#8208;CyFEs have evolved from a common ancestor with anaerobic sulfatase maturases (anSMEs), and possess a similar set of catalytic residues with anSMEs. Remarkably, the enzyme does not need leader peptide for activity and is fully active on a truncated peptide containing only 5 amino acids of the core sequence. Our work discloses the first ribosomal path towards Ama formation, providing a possible hint for the rich occurrence of Ama in Nature.</dc:description>

         <title>Electro&#8208;mediated PhotoRedox Catalysis for Selective C(sp3)&#8208;O Cleavages of Phosphinated Alcohols to Carbanions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a novel example of electro&#8208;mediated photoredox catalysis (e&#8208;PRC) in the reductive cleavage of C(sp  3  )&#8208;O bonds of phosphinated alcohols to alkyl carbanions. As well as deoxygenations, olefinations are reported which are  E  &#8208;selective and can be made  Z  &#8208;selective in a tandem reduction/photosensitization process where both steps are photoelectrochemically promoted. Spectroscopy, computation and catalyst structural variations reveal that our new naphthalene monoimide&#8208;type catalyst allows for a more intimate dispersive precomplexation of its radical anion form with the phosphinate substrate, facilitating a reactivity&#8208;determining C(sp  3  )&#8208;O cleavage. Surprisingly and in contrast to previously reported photoexcited radical anion chemistries, our conditions i) tolerate aryl chlorides/bromides and ii) do not give rise to Birch&#8208;type reductions.</dc:description>

         <title>The hydrates of TEMPO: Water vibrations reveal radical microsolvation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An organic radical monohydrate complex is detected in vacuum isolation at low temperature by FTIR supersonic jet spectroscopy for the first time. It is shown to exhibit a rich conformational and vibrational coupling dynamics, which can be drastically reduced by appropriate isotope substitution. Its detection with a new gas recycling infrared spectrometer demonstrates the thermal metastability of the gaseous TEMPO radical even under humid gas conditions. Compared to its almost isoelectronic and isostructural, closed shell ketone analog, the hydrogen bond of the solvating water is found to be less directional, but stronger and more strongly downshifting the bonded water OH stretch vibration. A second solvent water directs the first one into a metastable hydrogen bond position to solvate the nitrogen center and the first water at the same time.</dc:description>

         <title>From kinase inhibitors to multitarget ligands as powerful drug leads for Alzheimer&#8217;s disease using protein&#8208;templated synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multitarget directed ligands (MTDLs) are arising as promising tools to tackle complex diseases. The main goal of this work is to create powerful modulating agents for neurodegenerative disorders. To achieve this aim, we have combined fragments that inhibit key protein kinases involved in the main pathomolecular pathways of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) such as tau aggregation, neuroinflammation and decreased neurogenesis, whilst looking for a third action in beta&#8208;secretase (BACE1), responsible of &#946;&#8208;amyloid production. We obtained well&#8208;balanced MTDLs with in vitro activity in three different relevant targets and efficacy in two cellular models of AD. Furthermore, computational studies confirmed how these compounds accommodate adequately into the long and rather narrow BACE1 catalytic site. Finally, we employed in situ click chemistry using BACE1 as protein template as a versatile synthetic tool that allowed us to obtain further MTDLs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Versatile Silver(I) Pentafluorooxosulphate Reagent for the Synthesis of OSF5&#8208;Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the straightforward preparation of silver(I) pentafluorooxosulphate from commercially available AgF and OSF4  . The compound is surprisingly stable in a MeCN&#8208;solution. Apart from that, AgOSF5  has been further stabilised by the addition of 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine ligands. Starting from solutions of the unstabilised silver(I) salt, OSF5  &#8208;complexes with Ni(II), Cu(I) and Cu(II)&#8208;centres have been obtained. In addition, AgOSF5  has proven to be generally capable of mediating the transfer of OSF5  &#8208;groups to aryne&#8208;moieties, thus furnishing a new and safe method for the preparation of OSF5  &#8208;substituted arenes. X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis of selected transition metal OSF5  &#8208;compounds have revealed distorted octahedral [OSF5]&#8208;  anions which are extensively stabilised by hydrogen bonding.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling cysteine&#8208;free native chemical ligation at challenging junctions with a ligation auxiliary capable of base catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ligation auxiliaries are used in chemical protein synthesis to extend the scope of native chemical ligation (NCL) beyond cysteine. However, auxiliary&#8208;mediated ligations at sterically demanding junctions have been difficult. Often the thioester intermediate formed in the thiol exchange step of NCL accumulates because the subsequent S&#8594;N acyl transfer is extremely slow. Here we introduce the 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethyl (MPyE) group as the first auxiliary designed to aid the ligation reaction by catalysis. Notably, the MPyE auxiliary provides useful rates even for junctions containing proline or a &#946;&#8208;branched amino acid. Quantum chemical calculations suggest that the pyridine nitrogen acts as an intramolecular base in a rate&#8208;determining proton transfer step. The auxiliary is prepared in two steps and conveniently introduced by reductive alkylation. Auxiliary cleavage is induced upon treatment with TCEP/morpholine in presence of a Mn(II) complex as radical starter. The synthesis of a de novo designed 99mer peptide and an 80 aa long MUC1 peptide demonstrates the usefulness of the MPyE auxiliary.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous 2D and 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks with Dimensionality&#8208;Dependent Photocatalytic Activity in Promoting Radical Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dimensionality is a fundamental parameter to modulate the properties of solid materials by tuning electronic structures. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as a prominent class of porous crystalline materials, but the study of dimensional dependence on their physicochemical properties is still lacking. Here we illustrate photocatalytic performances of  N  ,  N  &#8208;diaryl dihydrophenazine (  PN  )&#8208;based COFs are heavily dependent on the structural dimensionality. Six isostructural imine&#8208;bonded  2D&#8208;PN  COFs with slipped AA stacking and one  3D&#8208;PN  COF with a 2&#8208;fold interpenetrated pts topology were prepared. All seven COFs can be heterogeneous photocatalysts to promote radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization of vinylcyclopropanes (VCPs), which typically produces polymers possessing the combination of linear (  l  ) and cyclic (  c  ) repeat units, whereas the  2D&#8208;PN  COFs, especially  2D&#8208;PN&#8208;2&#8208;OMe  exhibited much higher catalytic activity than the  3D&#8208;PN  COF, allowing the efficient synthesis of poly(VCPs) with controlled molecular weight, low dispersity and high  l  /  c  selectivity (up to 97%). The improved performance can be ascribed to that the 2D structure has a larger internal surface area, which can provide more catalytically active sites and promote the adsorption and concentration of reactants, higher photosensitizing ability and photoinduced electron transfer efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmable Chromism and Photoluminescence of Spiropyran&#8208;based Liquid Crystalline Polymer with Tunable Glass Transition Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spiropyran&#8208;based materials (SPBMs) can give responses to the stimulations induced by the light, heat, force, or pH, which have been used as triggers for many smart materials. Here, a cross&#8208;linkable SPBM containing mesogenic&#8208;units is synthesized, which is pale&#8208;colored, non&#8208;photoluminescent and non&#8208;mesogenic at a spiro form, but dark&#8208;colored, photoluminescent, and mesogenic at a merocyanine form. Moreover, the dynamic interconversion behaviors of the form in the different chemical environments are distinct. Liquid crystalline polymers (LCPs) containing the SPBMs cross&#8208;linked via a Vis&#8208;light, own a photoswitchable glass transition temperature (  T  g  ) and retain the switchable property; however, the SPBMs cross&#8208;linked via a UV&#8208;light will be locked at the MC state, because the molecular movement was frozen at the room temperature lower than the given  T  g  of the LCP. Thus, programmable chromism and photoluminescence based on the tunable  T  g  can be endowed to the functional materials prepared from the SPBMs.</dc:description>
