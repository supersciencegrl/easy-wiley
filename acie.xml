         <title>Electrochemiluminescence Distance and Reactivity of Coreactants Determine the Sensitivity of Bead&#8208;Based Immunoassays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using electrochemiluminescence (ECL) self&#8208;interference spectroscopy and microscopy imaging, the analytical sensitivity of bead&#8208;based ECL immunoassays was proposed to be determined by the light emission distance and reactivity of coreactant. Compared with tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine, 2,2&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;nitrilotriethanol can balance the distance&#8208;reactivity trade&#8208;off and thus apparently promote the sensitivity of immunoassays.







Abstract
Herein we report the study of electrochemiluminescence (ECL) generation by tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)ruthenium (Ru(bpy)32+) and five tertiary amine coreactants. The ECL distance and lifetime of coreactant radical cations were measured by ECL self&#8208;interference spectroscopy. And the reactivity of coreactants was quantitatively evaluated in terms of integrated ECL intensity. By statistical analysis of ECL images of single Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;labeled microbeads, we propose that ECL distance and reactivity of coreactant codetermine the emission intensity and thus the sensitivity of immunoassay. 2,2&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;nitrilotriethanol (BIS&#8208;TRIS) can well balance ECL distance&#8208;reactivity trade&#8208;off and enhance the sensitivity by 236&#8201;% compared with tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine (TPrA) in the bead&#8208;based immunoassay of carcinoembryonic antigen. The study brings an insightful understanding of ECL generation in bead&#8208;based immunoassay and a way of maximizing the analytical sensitivity from the aspect of coreactant.

         <title>Alternative Fast and Slow Primary Charge&#8208;Separation Pathways in Photosystem II</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two primary charge separation pathways are identified in the reaction center of Photosystem II, corresponding to different time scales and kinetic phases.







Abstract
Photosystem&#8208;II (PSII) is a multi&#8208;subunit protein complex that harvests sunlight to perform oxygenic photosynthesis. Initial light&#8208;activated charge separation takes place at a reaction centre consisting of four chlorophylls and two pheophytins. Understanding the processes following light excitation remains elusive due to spectral congestion, the ultrafast nature, and multi&#8208;component behaviour of the charge&#8208;separation process. Here, using advanced computational multiscale approaches which take into account the large&#8208;scale configurational flexibility of the system, we identify two possible primary pathways to radical&#8208;pair formation that differ by three orders of magnitude in their kinetics. The fast (short&#8208;range) pathway is dominant, but the existence of an alternative slow (long&#8208;range) charge&#8208;separation pathway hints at the evolution of redundancy that may serve other purposes, adaptive or protective, related to formation of the unique oxidative species that drives water oxidation in PSII.

         <title>Generation and Use of Glycosyl Radicals under Acidic Conditions: Glycosyl Sulfinates as Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycosyl radicals were generated under acidic conditions for the first time by the use of glycosyl sulfinates as precursors. This development enables the installation of glycosyl units directly onto pharmaceutically relevant pyridine cores by the Minisci reaction.







Abstract
We herein report a method that enables the generation of glycosyl radicals under highly acidic conditions. Key to the success is the design and use of glycosyl sulfinates as radical precursors, which are bench&#8208;stable solids and can be readily prepared from commercial starting materials. This development allows the installation of glycosyl units onto pyridine rings directly by the Minisci reaction. We further demonstrate the utility of this method in the late&#8208;stage modification of complex drug molecules, including the anticancer agent camptothecin. Experimental studies provide insight into the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Effector Regulated Catalytic Cyclization of Alkynoic Acids Using Pt2L4 Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt2L4 cages are found to catalyze the cyclization of alkynoic acids. The reaction rates are depending on effector guests bound in the cage, leading to an enhancement of the catalytic rate by up to 19&#8208;fold or a decrease by 5&#8208;fold. In contrast to this effector&#8208;controlled rate enhancement using the binding pocket of Pt2L4, the molecular analogue PtL4 displays no significant changes in catalytic rate. By effector induced rate changes of cage catalyzed reactions, unexpected new reactivity and complex autoregulation comes in sight.







Abstract
Metabolic pathways are highly regulated by effector molecules that influences the rate of enzymatic reactions. Inspired by the catalytic regulation found in living cells, we report a Pt2L4 cage of which the activity can be controlled by effectors that bind inside the cage. The cage shows catalytic activity in the lactonization of alkynoic acids, with the reaction rates dependent on the effector guest bound in the cage. Some effector guests enhance the rate of the lactonization by up to 19&#8208;fold, whereas one decreases it by 5&#8208;fold. When mixtures of specific substrates are used, both starting materials and products act as guests for the Pt2L4 cage, enhancing its catalytic activity for one substrate while reducing its activity for the other. The reported regulatory behavior obtained by the addition of effector molecules paves the way to the development of more complex, metabolic&#8208;like catalyst systems.

         <title>Endogenous Enzyme&#8208;Operated Spherical Nucleic Acids for Cell&#8208;Selective Protein Capture and Localization Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the introduction of enzyme&#8208;responsive units in aptamer&#8208;based spherical nucleic acids (SNAs), enzyme&#8208;activatable SNAs can be constructed to mediate the connection between an enzyme biomarker and proteins of interest (POI) and enable cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;selective POI capture and translocation regulation. The enzyme&#8208;control strategy is expandable to regulate diverse POI with flexible aptamer design.







Abstract
Precise regulation of protein activity and localization in cancer cells is crucial to dissect the function of the protein&#8208;involved cellular network in tumorigenesis, but there is a lack of suitable methodology. Here we report the design of enzyme&#8208;operated spherical nucleic acids (E&#8208;SNAs) for manipulation of the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of proteins with cancer&#8208;cell selectivity. The E&#8208;SNAs are constructed by programmable engineering of aptamer&#8208;based modules bearing enzyme&#8208;responsive units in predesigned sites and further combination with SNA nanotechnology. We demonstrate that E&#8208;SNAs are able to regulate cytoplasmic&#8208;to&#8208;nuclear shuttling of RelA protein efficiently and specifically in tumor cells, while they remain inactive in normal cells due to insufficient enzyme expression. We further confirmed the generality of this strategy by investigating the enzyme&#8208;modulated inhibition/activation of thrombin activity by varying the aptamer&#8208;based design.

         <title>Enhanced Carbon Monoxide Electroreduction to &gt;1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 C2+ Products Using Copper Catalysts Dispersed on MgAl Layered Double Hydroxide Nanosheet House&#8208;of&#8208;Cards Scaffolds</title>

&#8216;House&#8208;of&#8208;cards&#8217; structures composed by MgAl layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets help to disperse CuO&#8208;derived Cu (OD&#8208;Cu) catalysts. These porous structure enhanced CO gas infiltration through the catalyst layer. OD&#8208;Cu mixed with the LDH nanosheets catalysed CORR to C2+ products with a partial current density that is 14&#8208;fold higher than that exhibited by the unsupported OD&#8208;Cu.







Abstract
Cu catalysts are most apt for reducing CO(2) to multi&#8208;carbon products in aqueous electrolytes. To enhance the product yield, we can increase the overpotential and the catalyst mass loading. However, these approaches can cause inadequate mass transport of CO(2) to the catalytic sites, which will then lead to H2 evolution dominating the product selectivity. Herein, we use a MgAl LDH nanosheet &#8216;house&#8208;of&#8208;cards&#8217; scaffold to disperse CuO&#8208;derived Cu (OD&#8208;Cu). With this support&#8208;catalyst design, at &#8722;0.7&#8197;VRHE, CO could be reduced to C2+ products with a current density (jC2+) of &#8722;1251&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This is 14&#215; that of the jC2+ shown by unsupported OD&#8208;Cu. The current densities of C2+ alcohols and C2H4 were also high at &#8722;369 and &#8722;816&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 respectively. We propose that the porosity of the LDH nanosheet scaffold enhances CO diffusion through the Cu sites. The CO reduction rate can thus be increased, while minimizing H2 evolution, even when high catalyst loadings and large overpotentials are used.

         <title>Efficient Narrowband Circularly Polarized Light Emitters Based on 1,4&#8208;B,N&#8208;embedded Rigid Donor&#8211;Acceptor Helicenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Addressing the issue of broad fluorescence and CPL from helicenes, we present a design strategy capitalizing on intramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor interactions between N and B atoms. A straightforward synthesis of 1,4&#8208;B,N&#8208;embedded, configurationally stable single and double helicenes is described. The synthesized molecules exhibit unprecedentedly narrow&#8208;band emission (FWHM of 17&#8211;28&#8197;nm, 0.07&#8211;0.13&#8197;eV) and high quantum yields (72&#8201;%&#8211;85&#8201;%) for helicene&#8208;type compounds.







Abstract
Narrow&#8208;band emission is essential for applicable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) active materials in ultrahigh&#8208;definition CP&#8208;OLEDs. One of the most promising classes of CPL active molecules, helicenes, however, typically exhibit broad emission with a large Stokes shift. We present, herein, a design strategy capitalizing on intramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor interactions between nitrogen and boron atoms to address this issue. 1,4&#8208;B,N&#8208;embedded configurationally stable single&#8208; and double helicenes were synthesized straightforwardly. Both helicenes show unprecedentedly narrow fluorescence and CPL bands (full width at half maximum between 17&#8211;28&#8197;nm, 0.07&#8211;0.13&#8197;eV) along with high fluorescence quantum yields (72&#8211;85&#8201;%). Quantum chemical calculations revealed that the relative localization of the natural transition orbitals, mainly on the rigid core of the molecule, and small values of root&#8208;mean&#8208;square displacements between S0 and S1 state geometries, contribute to the narrower emission.

         <title>Near&#8208;Quantitative Preparation of Short Single&#8208;Stranded DNA Circles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design of splint strands allows for the near&#8208;quantitative monomeric cyclization of single DNA strands as short as 16 bases long by DNA T4 ligase. Circular DNA molecules have enhanced chemical stability in biological fluids, therefore, this work could facilitate a wide range of biomedical applications for single&#8208;stranded, short nucleic acids.







Abstract
Small, single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA) circles have many applications, such as templating rolling circle amplification (RCA), capturing microRNAs, and scaffolding DNA nanostructures. However, it is challenging to prepare such ssDNA circles, particularly when the DNA size becomes very small (e.g. a 20 nucleotide (nt) long ssDNA circle). Often, such short ssDNA dominantly form concatemers (either linear or circular) due to intermolecular ligation, instead of forming monomeric ssDNA circles by intramolecular ligation. Herein, a simple method to overcome this problem by designing the complementary linker molecules is reported. It is demonstrated that ssDNA, as short as 16&#8197;nts, can be enzymatically ligated (by the commonly used T4 DNA ligase) into monomeric ssDNA circles at high concentration (100&#8197;&#956;M) with high yield (97&#8201;%). This method does not require any special sequence, thus, it is expected to be generally applicable. The experimental protocol is identical to regular DNA ligation, thus, is expected to be user friendly for general chemists and biologists.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Sequential Cascade Reaction in an Engineered Protein Cage
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inside an artificial protein cage, a dual&#8208;metal&#8208;tagged guest protein catalyzed a linear, two&#8208;step sequential cascade reaction involving deprotection followed by hydroamination. This non&#8208;orthogonal tandem catalysis in an encapsulin nanocompartment opens an exciting toolbox for the development of compartmentalized prodrug activation reactions in biological systems.







Abstract
Herein, we describe the creation of an artificial protein cage housing a dual&#8208;metal&#8208;tagged guest protein that catalyzes a linear, two&#8208;step sequential cascade reaction. The guest protein consists of a fusion protein of HaloTag and monomeric rhizavidin. Inside the protein capsid, we established a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed allylcarbamate deprotection reaction followed by a gold&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closing hydroamination reaction that led to indoles and phenanthridines with an overall yield of up to 66&#8201;% in aqueous solutions. Furthermore, we show that the encapsulation stabilizes the metal catalysts against deactivation by air, proteins and cell lysate.

         <title>A Zeolite&#8208;Like Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Based Membrane for Reverse Selective Hydrogen Separation and Butane Isomer Sieving</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zeolite&#8208;like metal&#8208;organic framework (ZMOF) with an underlying ana topology is reported for the first time as a thin&#8208;film membrane. The ana&#8208;ZMOF membrane possesses high CO2 and butane permeabilities with high sorption CO2/H2 and diffusion C4/i&#8208;C4 selectivities. This new membrane is a promising candidate for application in the areas of high purity H2 production and butane isomer separation.







Abstract
Here, the fabrication of a defect&#8208;free membrane that is based on a zeolite&#8208;like metal&#8208;organic framework (ZMOF) with the underlying ana topology is reported. The unique ana&#8208;ZMOF structure provides high degree of pore connectivity, which is reflected by the fast transport of gases. Prominently, it offers an optimum pore&#8208;aperture size, affording notable sieving selectivity for butane/isobutane, and optimal pore energetics for reverse CO2/H2 separation. This emphasize the potential for the application of pure MOF membranes, paving the way to more sustainability of energy resources.

Cothermolysis of Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Ta(CO)4 with white phosphorus (P4) results in the formation of [{Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Ta}2(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;P8)], whose cyclooctatetraene&#8208;like (COT) cyclo&#8208;P8 ligand is the largest monocyclic polyphosphorus species observed to date. The reactivity and electrochemical properties of this exotic species are explored, furnishing unique polyphosphorus species of unprecedented size.







Abstract
The thermolysis of Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Ta(CO)4 with white phosphorus (P4) gives access to [{Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Ta}2(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;P8)] (A), representing the first complex containing a cyclooctatetraene&#8208;like (COT) cyclo&#8208;P8 ligand. While ring sizes of n &gt;6 have remained elusive for cyclo&#8208;Pn structural motifs, the choice of the transition metal, co&#8208;ligand and reaction conditions allowed the isolation of A. Reactivity investigations reveal its versatile coordination behaviour as well as its redox properties. Oxidation leads to dimerization to afford [{Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Ta}4(&#956;4,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;P16)][TEF]2 (4, TEF=[Al(OC{CF3}3)4]&#8722;). Reduction, however, leads to the fission of one P&#8722;P bond in A followed by rapid dimerization to form [K@[2.2.2]cryptand]2[{Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Ta}4(&#956;4,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;P16)] (5), which features an unprecedented chain&#8208;type P16 ligand. Lastly, A serves as a P2 synthon, via ring contraction to the triple&#8208;decker complex [{Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Ta}2(&#956;,&#951;6&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8208;P6)] (B).

         <title>Mesogenic Groups Control the Emitter Orientation in Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emitter Films
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our work shows how the distinct self&#8208;assembly of a liquid crystalline MR&#8208;TADF emitter can be exploited for generating (partially) aligned via solution&#8208;processed thin films &#8211; an advance towards high performance solution&#8208;processable organic semiconductors.







Abstract
The use of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters and emitters that show preferential horizontal orientation of their transition dipole moment (TDM) are two emerging strategies to enhance the efficiency of OLEDs. We present the first example of a liquid crystalline multi&#8208;resonance TADF (MR&#8208;TADF) emitter, DiKTa&#8208;LC. The compound possesses a nematic liquid crystalline phase between 80&#8201;&#176;C and 110&#8201;&#176;C. Importantly, the TDM of the spin&#8208;coated film shows preferential horizontal orientation, with an anisotropy factor, a, of 0.28, which is preserved in doped poly(vinylcarbazole) films. Green&#8208;emitting (&#955;EL=492&#8197;nm) solution&#8208;processed OLEDs based on DiKTa&#8208;LC showed an EQEmax of 13.6&#8201;%. We thus demonstrate for the first time how self&#8208;assembly of a liquid crystalline TADF emitter can lead to the so&#8208;far elusive control of the orientation of the transition dipole in solution&#8208;processed films, which will be of relevance for high&#8208;performance solution&#8208;processed OLEDs.

         <title>Enforced Electronic&#8208;Donor&#8208;Acceptor Complex Formation in Water for Photochemical Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sugar alcohol meglumine can solubilize organic compounds in water to synthetically useful levels, allowing the formation of enforced electron donor acceptor (EDA) complexes in water. These EDA complexes offer a new activation for light driven C&#8722;C and C&#8722;S cross&#8208;coupling chemistry without sensitizers.







Abstract
The amino alcohol meglumine solubilizes organic compounds in water and enforces the formation of electron donor acceptor (EDA) complexes of haloarenes with indoles, anilines, anisoles or thiols, which are not observed in organic solvents. UV&#8208;A photoinduced electron transfer within the EDA complexes induces the mesolytic cleavage of the halide ion and radical recombination of the arenes leading, after rearomatization and proton loss to C&#8722;C or C&#8722;S coupling products. Depending on the substitution pattern selective and unique cross&#8208;couplings are observed. UV and NMR measurements reveal the importance of the assembly for the photoinduced reaction. Enforced EDA aggregate formation in water allows new activation modes for organic photochemical synthesis.

         <title>Dynamic Activation of Ga Sites by Pt Dopant in Low&#8208;Temperature Liquid&#8208;Metal Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Persistent geometric features are identified within low&#8208;temperature liquid&#8208;metal catalysts that may provide active sites for the reaction catalysis. Furthermore, Ga atoms can play a key role in the catalysis mechanism due to an altered electronic structure resulting from the dopant atom and the stochastic nature of the liquid.







Abstract
Liquid GaPt catalysts with Pt concentrations as low as 1&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;atomic&#8201;% have recently been identified as highly active for the oxidation of methanol and pyrogallol under mild reaction conditions. However, almost nothing is known about how liquid state catalysts support these significant improvements in activity. Here, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations are employed to examine GaPt catalysts in isolation and interacting with adsorbates. We find that persistent geometric features can exist in the liquid state, given the correct environment. We postulate that the Pt dopant may not be limited to direct involvement in catalysis of reactions, but rather that its presence can also enable Ga atoms to become catalytically active.

         <title>Enantioselective Radical&#8208;Type 1,2&#8208;Alkoxy&#8208;Phosphinoylation to Styrenes Catalyzed by Chiral Vanadyl Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric 1,2&#8208;alkoxyphosphinoylation of styrenes with a broad substitution scope was realized for the first time by the use of a vanadyl complex bearing 3&#8208;(2,5&#8208;dimethylphenyl)&#8208;5&#8208;Br&#8208;substituted N&#8208;salicylidene&#8208;t&#8208;leucinate. The unprecedented catalytic reactions proceeded smoothly at 0&#8201;&#176;C with HP(O)Ph2 and t&#8208;BuOOH leading to products in up to 96&#8201;% ee. The remarkable asymmetric radical reactions involved highly enantioselective internal delivery of vanadyl&#8208;bound alkoxide to the benzylic center with the coordinated phosphinoyl group in a radical homolytic substitution manner.







Abstract
A series of vanadyl complexes bearing 3&#8208;t&#8208;butyl&#8208;5&#8208;bromo, 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;5&#8208;bromo, 3,5&#8208;dihalo&#8208;, and benzo&#8208;fused N&#8208;salicylidene&#8208;tert&#8208;leucinates was examined as catalysts for 1,2&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;phosphinoylation of 4&#8208;, 3&#8208;, 3,4&#8208;, and 3,5&#8208;substituted styrene derivatives (including Me/t&#8208;Bu, Ph, OR, Cl/Br, OAc, NO2, C(O)Me, CO2Me, CN, and benzo&#8208;fused) with HP(O)Ph2 in the presence of t&#8208;BuOOH (TBHP) in a given alcohol or cosolvent with MeOH. The best scenario involved the use of 5&#8197;mol&#8201;% 3&#8208;(2,5&#8208;dimethylphenyl)&#8208;5&#8208;Br (i.e., 3&#8208;DMP&#8208;5&#8208;Br) catalyst at 0&#8201;&#176;C in MeOH. The desired catalytic cross coupling reactions proceeded smoothly with enantioselectivities of up to 95&#8201;% ee of (R)&#8208;configuration as confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of several recrystallized products. The origin of enantiocontrol and homolytic substitution of the benzylic intermediates by vanadyl&#8208;bound methoxide and radical type catalytic mechanism were proposed.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral Sulfimides through the O&#8208;Alkylation of Enantioenriched Sulfinamides and Addition of Carbon Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral sulfimides were synthesized by an unusual oxygen&#8208;selective alkylation of readily available enantioenriched sulfinamides and the subsequent nucleophilic addition of Grignard reagents. This transformation enables access to the various enantioenriched chiral sulfimides including diaryl or dialkyl sulfimides bearing two similar carbon substituents.







Abstract
Chiral sulfimides, the aza&#8208;analogues of sulfoxides, are valuable compounds in organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we report an efficient method for preparing chiral sulfimides from easily available enantioenriched sulfinamides. The key step of this method is a stereospecific oxygen&#8208;selective alkylation of enantioenriched sulfinamides, which is accomplished by using isopropyl iodide, K2CO3, and DMPU. The resulting chiral sulfinimidate esters are transformed to chiral sulfimides by the nucleophilic addition of the Grignard reagents under simple conditions. This transformation enables access to the enantioenriched diaryl or dialkyl sulfimides bearing two similar carbon substituents, which are difficult to synthesize by previous methods.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenolysis of Aryl Triflates for Construction of Axially Chiral Biaryls</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed the first palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenolysis of aryl triflates through desymmetrization and kinetic resolution that allows the facile construction of axially chiral biaryl scaffolds with excellent results. These chiral compounds could be further converted into chiral monophosphine ligands, which were then used in asymmetric allylic alkylation to produce the desired product with high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Here we report the first palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenolysis of readily available aryl triflates via desymmetrization and kinetic resolution for facile construction of axially chiral biaryl scaffolds with excellent enantioselectivities and s selectivity factors. The axially chiral monophosphine ligands could be prepared from these chiral biaryl compounds and were further applied to palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation with excellent ee values and high branched and linear ratio, which demonstrated the potential utility of this methodology.

         <title>Expanding the Promiscuity of a Copper&#8208;Dependent Oxidase for Enantioselective Cross&#8208;Coupling of Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic promiscuity of a copper oxidase was expanded to accommodate new&#8208;to&#8208;nature enantioselective oxidative cross&#8208;coupling of 3&#8208;hydroxyindole esters with various nucleophiles. The resulting functionalized 2,2&#8208;disubstituted indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones showed excellent optical purity as well as anticancer activity.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose the highly enantioselective oxidative cross&#8208;coupling of 3&#8208;hydroxyindole esters with various nucleophilic partners as catalyzed by copper efflux oxidase. The biocatalytic transformation delivers functionalized 2,2&#8208;disubstituted indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones with excellent optical purity (90&#8211;99&#8201;% ee), which exhibited anticancer activity against MCF&#8208;7&#8197;cell lines, as shown by preliminary biological evaluation. Mechanistic studies and molecular docking results suggest the formation of a phenoxyl radical and enantiocontrol facilitated by a suited enzyme chiral pocket. This study is significant with regard to expanding the catalytic repertoire of natural multicopper oxidases as well as enlarging the synthetic toolbox for sustainable asymmetric oxidative coupling.

         <title>Copper(I) Photocatalyzed Bromonitroalkylation of Olefins: Evidence for Highly Efficient Inner&#8208;Sphere Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic bromonitroalkylations of activated and unactivated olefins with broad scope become possible in the presence of CuI&#8208;photocatalysts. The key to success for this transformation is the highly efficient interaction of CuII with radical intermediates, which can even outperform a highly favorable cyclization of a transient to a persistent radical.







Abstract
We report the visible light&#8208;mediated copper&#8208;catalyzed vicinal difunctionalization of olefins utilizing bromonitroalkanes as ATRA reagents. This protocol is characterized by high yields and fast reaction times under environmentally benign reaction conditions with exceptional scope, allowing the rapid functionalization of both activated and unactivated olefins. Moreover, late&#8208;stage functionnalization of biologically active molecules and upscaling to gram quantities is demonstrated, which offers manifold possibilities for further transformations, e.g. access to nitro&#8208; and aminocyclopropanes. Besides the synthetic utility of the title transformation, this study undergirds the exclusive role of copper in photoredox catalysis showing its ability to stabilize and interact with radical intermediates in its coordination sphere. EPR studies suggest that such interactions can even outperform a highly favorable cyclization of transient to persistent radicals contrasting iridium&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>An Electrochemical Nanosensor for Monitoring the Dynamics of Intracellular H2O2 Upon NADH Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A H2O2&#8208;selective nanoelectrode is reported to monitor the dynamics of H2O2 produced by NADH treatment, indicating the potential tumor suppressor role of NADH. This work not only provides a potential therapeutic strategy for cancer therapy, but also offers a powerful technique to screen the cancer treatment.







Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;based therapeutic strategies play an important role in cancer treatment. However, in situ, real&#8208;time and quantitative analysis of intracellular ROS in cancer treatment for drug screening is still a challenge. Herein we report one selective hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrochemical nanosensor, which is prepared by electrodeposition of Prussian blue (PB) and polyethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT) onto carbon fiber nanoelectrode. With the nanosensor, we find that the level of intracellular H2O2 increases with NADH treatment and that increase is dose&#8208;dependent to the concentration of NADH. High&#8208;dose of NADH (above 10&#8197;mM) can induce cell death and intratumoral injection of NADH is validated for inhibiting tumor growth in mice. This study highlights the potential of electrochemical nanosensor for tracking and understanding the role of H2O2 in screening new anticancer drug.

         <title>Lithium Salt Dissociation Promoted by 18&#8208;Crown&#8208;6 Ether Additive toward Dilute Electrolytes for High Performance Lithium Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 ether additive regulates the solvation structure of electrolyte, avoids nucleophilic attack of reactive oxygen species on the solvent, and reduces harmful gases release. The solution&#8208;mediated mechanism is triggered to enhance the discharge capacity, and the anion&#8208;derived SEI protects Li anode to improve the cycling stability of lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries (LOBs) are well known for their high energy density. However, their reversibility and rate performance are challenged due to the sluggish oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER) kinetics, serious side reactions and uncontrollable Li dendrite growth. The electrolyte plays a key role in transport of Li+ and reactive oxygen species in LOBs. Here, we tailored a dilute electrolyte by screening suitable crown ether additives to promote lithium salt dissociation and Li+ solvation through electrostatic interaction. The electrolyte containing 100&#8197;mM 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 ether (100&#8208;18C6) exhibits enhanced electrochemical stability and triggers a solution&#8208;mediated Li2O2 growth pathway in LOBs, showing high discharge capacity of 10&#8201;828.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;gcarbon&#8722;1. Moreover, optimized electrode/electrolyte interfaces promote ORR/OER kinetics on cathode and achieve dendrite&#8208;free Li anode, which enhances the cycle life. This work casts new lights on the design of low&#8208;cost dilute electrolytes for high performance LOBs.

         <title>Immunogenic Cell Death Inducing Metal Complexes for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metastases and tumor relapse are the leading causes of cancer&#8208;associated deaths. Among other approaches, much research interest has been devoted to immunogenic cell death inducing agents that are able to trigger localized cell death of the cancer cells as well as induce an immune response inside the whole organism. Herein, the application of metal complexes as immunogenic cell death triggering compounds is systematically reviewed.







Abstract
Cancer is one of the deadliest diseases worldwide. Recent statistics have shown that metastases and tumor relapse are the leading causes of cancer&#8208;associated deaths. While traditional treatments are able to efficiently remove the primary tumor, secondary tumors remain poorly accessible. Capitalizing on this there is an urgent need for novel treatment modalities. Among the most promising approaches, increasing research interest has been devoted to immunogenic cell death inducing agents that are able to trigger localized cell death of the cancer cells as well as induce an immune response inside the whole organism. Preliminary studies have shown that immunogenic cell death inducing compounds could be able to overcome metastatic and relapsing tumors. Herein, the application of metal complexes as immunogenic cell death inducing compounds is systematically reviewed.

         <title>Achieving High Single&#8208;Pass Carbon Conversion Efficiencies in Durable CO2 Electroreduction in Strong Acids via Electrode Structure Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrode&#8208;structure&#8208;engineering strategy is developed to achieve efficient, selective, and stable CO2 reduction (CO2R) with high CO2 utilization. This strategy creates a near&#8208;neutral pH and enriches K+ near catalyst surfaces during CO2R in strong acids. A stratified SiC&#8208;NafionTM/SnBi/polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) electrode consistently produces formic acid with a single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency of &gt;75&#8201;% and Faradaic efficiency of &gt;90&#8201;% at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, lasting over 125&#8197;h at pH&#8197;1.@MiaoZhong&#8194;Group







Abstract
Acidic CO2 reduction (CO2R) holds promise for the synthesis of low&#8208;carbon&#8208;footprint chemicals using renewable electricity. However, the corrosion of catalysts in strong acids causes severe hydrogen evolution and rapid deterioration of CO2R performance. Here, by coating catalysts with an electrically nonconductive nanoporous SiC&#8208;NafionTM layer, a near&#8208;neutral pH was stabilized on catalyst surfaces, thereby protecting the catalysts against corrosion for durable CO2R in strong acids. Electrode microstructures played a critical role in regulating ion diffusion and stabilizing electrohydrodynamic flows near catalyst surfaces. This surface&#8208;coating strategy was applied to three catalysts, SnBi, Ag, and Cu, and they exhibited high activity over extended CO2R operation in strong acids. Using a stratified SiC&#8208;NafionTM/SnBi/polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) electrode, constant production of formic acid was achieved with a single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency of &gt;75&#8201;% and Faradaic efficiency of &gt;90&#8201;% at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over 125&#8197;h at pH&#8197;1.

         <dc:description>
Sugar alcohol meglumine enhances the solubility of organic compounds in water and enforces their electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complexes formation allowing photochemical C&#8722;C and C&#8722;S cross&#8208;coupling transformations without sensitizers. The light&#8208;driven redox neutral protocol connects haloarenes with indoles, anilines, anisoles, and thiols, as reported by Burkhard K&#246;nig and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202218775).

         <title>Dual&#8208;Atomic&#8208;Site Catalysts for Molecular Oxygen Activation in Heterogeneous Thermo&#8208;/Electro&#8208;catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient molecular oxygen activation (MOA) is the key to environmentally friendly catalytic oxidation reactions. In the last decade, single&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (SASCs) with nearly 100% atomic utilization and unique electronic structure have been widely investigated for MOA. However, the single active site makes the activation effect unsatisfactory and difficult to deal with complex catalytic reactions. Recently, dual&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (DASCs) have provided a new idea for the effective activation of molecular O2 due to more diverse active sites and synergetic interactions among adjacent atoms. In this review, we systematically summarized the recent research progress of DASCs for MOA in heterogeneous thermo&#8208; and electrocatalysis. Finally, we look forward to the challenges and application prospects in the construction of DASCs for MOA.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Conventional photocages only respond to short wavelength light, which is a significant obstacle to developing efficient phototherapy in vivo. The development of photocages activated by near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light at wavelengths from 700 to 950 nm is important for in vivo studies but remains challenging. Herein, we describe the synthesis of a photocage based on a ruthenium (Ru) complex with NIR light&#8208;triggered photocleavage reaction. The commercial anticancer drug, tetrahydrocurcumin (THC), was coordinated to the Ru(II) center to create the Ru&#8208;based photocage that is readily responsive to NIR light at 760 nm. The photocage inherited the anticancer properties of THC. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we further engineered a self&#8208;assembled photocage&#8208;based nanoparticle system with amphiphilic block copolymers. Upon exposure to NIR light at 760 nm, the Ru complex&#8208;based photocages were released from the polymeric nanoparticles and efficiently inhibited tumor proliferation in vivo.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Conversion of CO2 and Cellulose to Formate Using a Floating TiO2&#8208;Enzyme Photoreforming Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formate production via both CO2 reduction and cellulose oxidation in a solar&#8208;driven process is achieved by a semiartificial biohybrid photocatalyst consisting of immobilized formate dehydrogenase on titanium dioxide (TiO2|FDH) producing up to 1.16&#177;0.04 mmolformate gTiO2&#8211;1 in 24 hours. Isotopic labelling experiments with 13C&#8208;labelled substrates support the mechanism of stoichiometric formate formation through both redox half&#8208;reactions. TiO2|FDH was further immobilized on hollow glass microspheres to perform more practical floating photoreforming allowing vertical solar light illumination with optimal light exposure of the photocatalyst to real sunlight. Enzymatic cellulose depolymerization coupled to the floating photoreforming catalyst generates 0.36&#177;0.04 mmolformate mirr&#8211;2 after 24 h. This work thus presents simultaneous solar&#8208;driven valorization of waste streams, demonstrates the advantages of biohybrid photocatalysts in photoreforming for the first time and will provide inspiration for the development of future semi&#8208;artificial waste&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Water Activation for Boosting Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In conventional luminol electrochemiluminescence (ECL) systems, hydrogen peroxide and dissolved oxygen are employed as typical co&#8208;reactants to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) for efficient ECL emission. However, the self&#8208;decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and limited solubility of oxygen in water inevitably restrict the detection accuracy and luminous efficiency of luminol ECL system. Inspired by ROS&#8208;mediated ECL mechanism, for the first time, we used cobalt&#8208;iron layered double hydroxide as co&#8208;reaction accelerator to efficiently activate water to generate ROS for enhancing luminol emission. Experimental investigations verify the formation of hydroxyl and superoxide radicals in the process of electrochemical water oxidation, which subsequently react with luminol anion radicals to trigger strong ECL signals. Finally, the detection of alkaline phosphatase has been successfully achieved with impressive sensitivity and reproducibility for practical sample analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Closing the Cycle as It Begins: Synthesis of ortho&#8208;Iodobiaryls via Catellani Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the advances in the field of carbon&#8208;halogen bond formation, the straightforward catalytic access to selectively functionalized iodoaryls remains a challenge. Here, we report a one&#8208;pot synthesis of ortho&#8208;iodobiaryls from aryl iodides and bromides by palladium/norbornene catalysis. This new example of Catellani reaction features the initial cleavage of a C(sp2)&#8208;I bond, followed by the key formation of a palladacycle through ortho C&#8208;H activation, the oxidative addition of an aryl bromide and the ultimate restoration of the C(sp2)&#8208;I bond. A large variety of valuable o&#8208;iodobiaryls has been synthesized in satisfactory to good yields and their derivatization have been described too. Beyond the synthetic utility of this transformation, a DFT study provides insights on the mechanism of the key reductive elimination step, which is driven by an original transmetallation between palladium(II)&#8208;halides complexes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Abstract: &#160;Solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries are considered as the next generation of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. However, their solid electrolytes suffer from low ionic conductivity, poor interface performance, and high production costs, restricting&#160;their commercial application. Herein, a low&#8208;cost cellulose acetate&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid composite polymer electrolyte (C&#8208;CLA QPE) was developed with a high Li + &#160;transference number (tLi+) of 0.85 and excellent interface stability. The prepared LiFePO 4 &#160;(LFP)|C&#8208;CLA QPE|Li batteries exhibited excellent cycle performance with a capacity retention of 97.7% after 1200 cycles at 1 C and 25&#8451;. The experimental results and Density Function Theory (DFT) simulation revealed that the partially esterified side groups in the CLA matrix contribute to the migration of Li + &#160;and enhance electrochemical stability. This work provides a promising strategy for fabricating cost&#8208;effective, stable polymer electrolytes for solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Polarization&#8208;dependent sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy for in situ tracking of nanoparticle morphology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The surface structure of oxide supported metal nanoparticles can be determined via characteristic vibrations of adsorbed probe molecules such as CO. Usually, spectroscopic studies focus on peak position and intensity, which are related to binding geometries and number of adsorption sites, respectively. Employing two differently prepared model catalysts it is demonstrated that polarization&#8208;dependent sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy reveals the average surface structure and shape of the nanoparticles. SFG results for different particle sizes and morphologies are compared to direct (real&#8208;space) structure analysis by TEM and STM. The described feature of SFG could be used to monitor particle restructuring in situ and may be a valuable tool for operando catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Activated Circularly Polarized Luminescence Film Based on Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Copper(I) Cluster&#8208;Assembled Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, a pair of chiral copper(I) cluster&#8208;assembled materials (R/S&#8208;2) was prepared, exhibiting unique photo&#8208;response characteristics with a concentration&#8208;wavelength correlation property in DMSO solution. By the combination of R/S&#8208;2 with a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) matrix, the first photo&#8208;activated circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) film was developed, the CPL signal (glum = 9&#215;10&#8208;3) of which could be induced by UV light irradiation. Moreover, the film exhibited a reversible photo&#8208;response and extremely good fatigue resistance. Mechanism study revealed that the photo&#8208;response properties of the R/S&#8208;2 solution and film are attributed to the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics of R/S&#8208;2 and a photo&#8208;induced deoxygenation process. This study enriches the types of luminescent cluster&#8208;assembled molecules and provides a new strategy for the construction of metal cluster&#8208;based stimuli&#8208;responsive composite materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Ammonium Ion Batteries: Material, Electrochemistry and Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonium&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs) have recently attracted increasingattention in the field of aqueous batteries owing to their high safety and fast diffusion kinetics. The NH4+ storage mechanism is quite different from that of spherical metal ions (e.g.Li+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Zn2+) because of the formation of hydrogen bonds between NH4+ and host materials. Although many materials have been proposed as electrode materials for AIBs, their performances hardly meet the requirement of future electrochemical energystorage devices. It is thus urgent to design and exploit advancedmaterials for AIBs. Thisreviewhighlights the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art researches on AIBs. The insights into the basic configuration, operating mechanism andrecent progress of electrode materials and corresponding electrolytes for AIBs have been comprehensively outlined. The electrode materials are classified and compared according to different NH4+ storage behaviour in the structure. Thechallenges, design strategiesand perspectives are also discussed for the futuredevelopment of AIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>The Self&#8208;Association of the KRAS4b Protein is Altered by Lipid&#8208;Bilayer Composition and Electrostatics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>KRAS is a peripheral membrane protein that regulates multiple signaling pathways, and is mutated in ~30% of cancers. Transient self&#8208;association of KRAS is essential for activation of the downstream effector RAF and oncogenicity. The presence of anionic phosphatidylserine (PS) lipids in the membrane was shown to promote KRAS self&#8208;assembly, however, the structural mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we employed nanodisc bilayers of defined lipid compositions, and probed the impact of PS concentration on KRAS self&#8208;association. Paramagnetic NMR experiments demonstrated the existence of two transient dimer conformations involving alternate electrostatic contacts between R135 and either D153 or E168 on the '&#945;4/5&#8208;&#945;4/5' interface, and revealed that lipid composition and salt modulate their dynamic equilibrium. These dimer interfaces were validated by charge&#8208;reversal mutants. This plasticity demonstrates how the dynamic KRAS dimerization interface responds to the environment, and likely extends to the assembly of other signaling complexes on the membrane.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Local Electric Field Induced Interface Water Reorientation for&#160;Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The slow water dissociation process in alkaline electrolyte severely limits the kinetics of HER. The orientation of H2O is well known to affect the dissociation process, but H2O orientation is hard to control because of its random distribution. Herein, an atomically asymmetric local electric field was designed by IrRu dizygotic single&#8208;atom sites (IrRu DSACs) to tune the H2O adsorption configuration and orientation, thus optimizing its dissociation process. The electric field intensity of IrRu DSACs is over 4.00 &#215;1010 N/C. The ab initio molecular dynamics simulations combined with in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy analysis on the adsorption behavior of H2O show that the M&#8208;H bond length (M = active site) is shortened at the interface due to the strong local electric field gradient and the optimized water orientation promotes the dissociation process of interfacial water. This work provides a new way to explore the role of single atomic sites in alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Parahydrogen&#8208;Induced Polarization of a Labeled, Cancer&#8208;Targeting DNA Aptamer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enhancing NMR signals of biomacromolecules by hyperpolarization offers exciting opportunities for diagnostic applications. However, their hyperpolarization via parahydrogen remains challenging as specific catalytic interactions are required, which are difficult to tune due to the large size of the biomolecule and its insolubility in organic solvents. Herein, we show the unprecedented hyperpolarization of the cancer&#8208;targeting DNA aptamer AS1411. By screening different molecular motifs for an unsaturated label in nucleosides and in DNA oligomers, we were able to identify structural prerequisites for the hyperpolarization of AS1411. Finally, adjusting the polarity of AS1411 by complexing the DNA backbone with amino polyethylene glycol chains allowed the hydrogenation of the label with parahydrogen while the DNA structure remains stable to maintain its biological function. Our results are expected to advance hyperpolarized molecular imaging technology for disease detection in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Spontaneous Chirality Induction in the Assembly of a Single Layer 2&#8208;D Network with Switchable Pores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although two dimensional (2&#8208;D) chiral sheet structures are attractive because of unique chemical and physical properties, single layer 2&#8208;D chiral network structures with switchable pore interior remain elusive. Here we report spontaneous chirality induction in a single layer 2&#8208;D network structure formed from the self&#8208;assembly of tetrapod azobenzene molecules. The chirality induction arises from multiple sublayers slipped in a preferred direction in which the sublayer consists of unidentical molecular arrangements in in&#8208;plane a and b directions, breaking both plane of symmetry and inversion symmetry. The protruded azobenzene units in the pore interior can be selectively isomerized upon UV irradiation, resulting in a reversible deformation of the chiral pores while maintaining 2&#8208;D frameworks. The chiral network can thus selectively entrap one enantiomer from a racemic solution with near perfect enantioselectivity, and then release upon UV irradiation.</dc:description>

Herein, we designed a bioinspired proton transport membrane by bringing flexible 14&#8208;crown&#8208;4 (14C4) units into rigid frameworks of polyimine films by an interfacial Schiff base reaction. The Young&#8217;s modulus of the membrane reaches ~8.2 GPa. The 14C4 units could grab water forming hydrogen bond&#8208;water networks and acting as jumping sites to lower the energy barrier of proton transport. The molecular chains present a vertical orientation to the membrane, and the ions travel between the quasi&#8208;planar molecular sheets. Also, the 14C4 moieties could bond alkali ions via host&#8208;guest interaction. Thus, the ion conductance follows H+ &#8811; K+ &gt; Na+&gt; Li+, and an ultrahigh selectivity of H+/Li+ (~215) is resulted. This study provides an effective avenue for developing ion&#8208;selective membranes by embedding macrocycles motif with inherent cavities.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative Proton and Li&#8208;ion Conduction in a 2D&#8208;layered MOF via Mechanical Insertion of Lithium Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ionic conduction in highly designable and porous metal&#8208;organic frameworks has been explored through the introduction of various ionic species (H+, OH&#8211;, Li+, etc.) using post&#8208;synthetic modification such as acid, salt, or ionic liquid incorporation. Here, we report on high ionic conductivity (&#963; &gt; 10&#8211;2 S cm&#8211;1) in a two&#8208;dimensionally (2D)&#8208;layered Ti&#8208;dobdc (Ti2(Hdobdc)2(H2dobdc), H4dobdc: 2,5&#8208;dihydroxyterephthalic acid) via LiX (X= Cl, Br, I) intercalation using mechanical mixing. The anionic species in lithium halide strongly affect the ionic conductivity and durability of conductivity. Solid&#8208;state pulsed&#8208;field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG&#8208;NMR)&#160;verified the high mobility of H+ and Li+ ions in the temperature range of 300&#8211;400 K. In particular, the insertion of Li salts improved the H+ mobility above 373 K owing to strong binding with H2O. Furthermore, the continuous increase in Li+ mobility with temperature contributed to the retention of the overall high ionic conductivity at high temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Engineering on Solvation Structure of Carbonate Electrolyte toward Durable Sodium Metal Battery at &#8208;40 oC</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbonate electrolytes have excellent chemical stability and high salt solubility, which is ideally practical choice for achieving high energy density sodium (Na) metal battery at room temperature. However, their application at ultra&#8208;low temperature (&#8208;40 oC) is adversely affected by the instability of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed by electrolyte decomposition and the difficulty of desolvation. Here, we designed a novel low&#8208;temperature carbonate electrolyte by molecular engineering on solvation structure. The calculations show that ethylene sulfate (ES) inhibits solvent decomposition and reduces the sodium ion desolvation energy. In addition, experimental results demonstrate that ES promotes the forming of more inorganic substances on the Na surface, which inhibits dendrite growth and increases ionic conductivity. At &#8208;40 oC, the Na||Na symmetric battery exhibits a stable cycle of 1500 hours, and the Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) battery achieves 88.2% capacity retention after 200 cycles. Our work provides a new way to develop high energy density sodium metal battery under extreme low temperature environment.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;to&#8208;UV Photon Upconversion: Recent Progress in New Materials and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultraviolet (UV, &#955; &lt; 400 nm) light is essential for various photochemical reactions, but its intensity in the solar spectrum is very low, and light sources that artificially generate high&#8208;energy UV light are inefficient and environmentally unfriendly. A solution to this problem is photon upconversion (UC) from visible (vis, &#955; &gt; 400 nm) light to UV light. Among several mechanisms, UC based on triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA&#8208;UC) in particular has made remarkable progress in recent years. The development of new chromophores has enabled highly efficient conversion of low&#8208;intensity visible light into UV light. In this review, we summarize the recent development of visible&#8208;to&#8208;UV TTA&#8208;UC, from the development of chromophores and their production into films to their application in various photochemical processes such as catalysis, bond activation and polymerization. Finally, challenges and opportunities in future material development and applications will be discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid Interhalogen Compounds with Effective Br0 Fixing for Stable High&#8208;energy Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Though massive efforts have been devoted to exploring Br&#8208;based batteries, the highly soluble Br2/Br3&#8208; species causing rigorous &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221;, leads to severe self&#8208;discharge and low Coulombic efficiency. Conventionally, quaternary ammonium salts such as methyl ethyl morpholinium bromide (MEMBr) and tetrapropylammonium bromide (TPABr) are used to fix Br2 and Br3&#8208;, but they occupy the mass and volume of battery without capacity contribution. Here, we report an all&#8208;active solid interhalogen compound, IBr, as a cathode to address the above challenges, in which the oxidized Br0 is fixed by iodine (I), thoroughly eliminating cross&#8208;diffusing Br2/Br3&#8208; species during the whole charging and discharging process. The Zn||IBr battery delivers remarkably high energy density of 385.8 Wh&#215;kg&#8208;1, which is higher than those of I2, MEMBr3, and TPABr3 cathodes. Our work provides new approaches to achieve active solid interhalogen chemistry for high&#8208;energy electrochemical energy storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Loading of Amino Acids onto RNA in a Putative RNA&#8208;Peptide World</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>RNA is a molecule that can both store genetic information and perform catalytic reactions. This observed dualism places RNA into the limelight of concepts about the origin of life. The RNA world concept argues that life started from self&#8208;replicating RNA molecules, which evolved toward increasingly complex structures. Recently, we demonstrated that RNA, with the help of conserved non&#8208;canonical nucleosides, which are also putative relics of an early RNA world, had the ability to grow peptides covalently connected to RNA nucleobases, creating RNA&#8208;peptide chimeras. It is conceivable that such molecules, which combined the information&#8208;coding properties of RNA with the catalytic potential of amino acid side chains, were once the structures from which life emerged. Herein, we report prebiotic chemistry that enabled the loading of both nucleosides and RNAs with amino acids as the first step toward RNA&#8208;based peptide synthesis in a putative RNA&#8208;peptide world.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective C&#8208;Aryl Glycosylation by Catalytic Cross&#8208;Coupling of Heteroaryl Glycosyl Sulfones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stereoselective C&#8208;glycosylation reactions are increasingly gaining attention in carbohydrate chemistry because they enable glycosyl precursors, easily accessible as anomeric mixtures, to converge to a single diastereomeric product. However, controlling the stereochemical outcome via transition metal catalysis remains challenging, and methods that leverage bench&#8208;stable heteroaryl glycosyl sulfone donors to facilitate glycosylation are rare. Here, we show two complementary nonprecious metal catalytic systems, based on iron or nickel, which are capable of promoting efficient C&#8722;C coupling between heteroaryl glycosyl sulfones and aromatic nucleophiles or electrophiles via distinct mechanisms and modes of activation. Diverse C&#8208;aryl glycosides were secured with excellent selectivity, scope, and functional group compatibility, and reliable access to both &#945; and &#946; isomers could be achieved for key sugar residues.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of a Versatile Protein Labeling Tool for Live&#8208;Cell Imaging Using Fluorescent &#223;&#8208;Lactamase Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To &#160;understand the function of protein in live cells, real&#8208;time monitoring of protein dynamics and sensing their surrounding environment are important methods. Fluorescent labeling tools are thus needed that possess fast labeling kinetics, high efficiency, and long&#8208;term stability. We developed a versatile chemical protein&#8208;labeling tool based on fluorophore&#8208;conjugated diazabicyclooctane &#946;&#8208;lactamase inhibitors (BLIs) and wild&#8208;type TEM&#8208;1 &#946;&#8208;lactamase protein tag. The&#160;fluorescent probes efficiently formed a stable carbamoylated complex with &#946;&#8208;lactamase and the labeled proteins were visualized over a long period of time in live cells. Moreover, use of an &#945;&#8208;fluorinated carboxylate ester&#8208;based BLI prodrug enabled the probe to permeate cell membranes and stably label intracellular proteins after unexpected spontaneous ester hydrolysis. Lastly, combining the labeling tool with a pH&#8208;activatable fluorescent probe allowed visual monitoring of lysosomal protein translocation during autophagy.</dc:description>

         <title>Rationally Modulating the Functions of Ni3Sn2&#8208;NiSnOx Nanocomposite Electrocatalysts towards Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Identifying electrocatalysts with functions of easy dissociation of water, rapid transformation of hydroxyl and facile hydrogen&#8208;hydrogen bond formation are indispensable while challenge for realizing efficient alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we presented the design of Ni3Sn2&#8208;NiSnOx nanocomposites towards addressing this challenge. We showed that Ni3Sn2 possessed ideal hydrogen adsorption and low hydroxyl adsorption abilities and NiSnOx facilitated water dissociation and hydroxyl transfer process, respectively. Consequently, the fine&#8208;tuned interplay of the two functional parts realized the mutual coordination among the multiple functions and led to significantly boosted HER kinetics.&#160;Current densities of 10 and 1000 mA cm&#8208;2 were obtained at overpotentials of&#160;14 and 165 mV on the optimized catalyst. This work highlights the significance of considering intrinsic interactions between active sites and all pertinent intermediates on obtaining promising electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Toward Scalable Nanofluidic Osmotic Power Generation from Hypersaline Water Sources with a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanofluidic membranes have shown great promise in harvesting osmotic energy but its scalablity remains challenging since most studies only tested with a membrane area of ~10&#8208;2 mm2 or smaller. We demonstrate that metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework membranes with subnanometer pores can be used for scalable osmotic power generation from hypersaline water sources. Our membrane can be scaled up to a few mm2, and the power density can be stabilized at 1.7 W/m2. We reveal that the key is to improve the out&#8208;of&#8208;membrane conductance while keeping the membrane&#8217;s charge selectivity, contradicting the previous conception that the ionic conductivity of the membrane plays the dominating role. We highlight that subnanometer pores are essential to ensure the charge selectivity in hypersaline water sources. Our results suggest the importance to engineer the interplay between the in&#8208;membrane and out&#8208;of&#8208;membrane ion transport properties for scalable osmotic power generation.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Photochemical Activation of Peroxymonosulfate in Xanthene&#8208;Rich Systems for Fenton&#8208;Like Synergistic Decontamination: Efficacy of Proton Transfer Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalyst&#8208;free visible light assisted Fenton&#8208;like catalysis offers opportunities to achieve the sustainable water decontamination, but the synergistic decontamination mechanisms are still unclear, especially the effect of proton transfer process (PTP). The conversion of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) in photosensitive dye&#8208;enriched system was detailed. The photo&#8208;electron transfer between excited dye and PMS triggered the efficient activation of PMS and enhanced the production of reactive species. Photochemistry behavior analysis and DFT calculations revealed that PTP was the crucial factor to determine the decontamination performance, leading to the transformation of dye molecules. The excitation process inducing activation of whole system was composed of low energy excitations, and the electrons and holes were almost contributed by LUMO and HOMO. This work provided new ideas for the design of catalyst&#8208;free sustainable system for efficient decontamination.</dc:description>

         <title>Lattice Mismatch Guided Nickel&#8208;Indium Heterogeneous Alloy Electrocatalysts for Promoting the Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The immiscibility of crystallographic facets in multi&#8208;metallic catalysts plays a key role in driving the green H2 production by water electrolysis. The lattice mismatch between tetragonal In and face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) Ni is 14.9% but the mismatch with hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) Ni is 49.8%. Hence, in a series of Ni&#8208;In heterogeneous alloys, In is selectively incorporated in the fcc Ni. The 18&#8208;20 nm Ni particles have 36 wt% fcc phase, which increases to 86% after In incorporation. The charge transfer from In to Ni, stabilizes the Ni0 state and In develops a fractional positive charge that favors *OH adsorption. With only 5 at% In, 153 mL h&#8208;1 H2 is evolved at &#8208;385 mV with mass activity of 57.5 A g&#8208;1 at &#8208; 400 mV, 200 h stability at &#8208;0.18 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and Pt&#8208;like activity at high current densities, due to the spontaneous water dissociation, lower activation energy barrier, optimal adsorption energy of OH&#8208; ions and the prevention of catalyst poisoning.</dc:description>

         <title>Protein Oligomer Engineering: A New Frontier for Studying Protein Structure, Function, and Toxicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prevalently in nature, protein oligomers play critical roles both physiologically and pathologically. The multimeric nature and conformational transiency of protein oligomers greatly complicate a more detailed glimpse into the molecular structure as well as function. In this minireview, the oligomers are classified and elaborated on the basis of biological function, toxicity, and application. We also define the bottlenecks in recent oligomer studies and further review numerous frontier methods for engineering protein oligomers. Being made on many fronts for a wide variety of applications, protein grafting is highlighted as a promising and robust method for engineering. These advances collectively allow the engineering and design of stabilized oligomers that bring us one step closer to understanding their biological functions, toxicity, and a wide range of applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Quenched Size&#8208;Expanded Nucleotide Reports Activity of the Leukemia Biomarker Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase (TdT)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Terminal deoxynucleotidyl Transferase (TdT) is a template&#8208;independent DNA polymerase that plays an essential role in the human adaptive immune system and is upregulated in several types of leukemia. It has therefore gained interest as a leukemia biomarker and potential therapeutic target. Herein, we describe a FRET&#8208;quenched fluorogenic probe based on a size&#8208;expanded deoxyadenosine that reports directly on TdT enzymatic activity. The probe enables real&#8208;time detection of primer extension and de novo synthesis activity of TdT and displays selectivity over other polymerase and phosphatase enzymes. Importantly, TdT activity and its response to treatment with a promiscuous polymerase inhibitor could be monitored in human T&#8208;lymphocyte cell extract and Jurkat cells using a simple fluorescence assay. Finally, employing the probe in a high&#8208;throughput assay resulted in the identification of a non&#8208;nucleoside TdT inhibitor.</dc:description>

         <title>Lithium Aluminium Hydride and Metallic Iron: A Powerful Team in Alkene and Arene Hydrogenation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkenes that normally do not react with LiAlH4 (3&#8208;hexene, cyclohexene, 1&#8208;Me&#8208;cyclohexene), can be reduced to the corresponding alkanes by a mixture of LiAlH4 and Fe0 (the iron was activated by Metal&#8208;Vapour&#8208;Synthesis). This alkene&#8208;to&#8208;alkane conversion with a stoichiometric quantity of LiAlH4/Fe0 does not need quenching with water or acids, implying that both H&#8217;s originate from LiAlH4. The LiAlH4/Fe0 combination is also a remarkably potent cooperative catalyst for hydrogenation of multi&#8208;substituted alkenes and benzene or toluene. An induction period of circa two hours and the minimally required temperature of 120 &#176;C, suggests that the actual catalyst is a combination of Fe0 and the decomposition product of LiAlH4 (LiH and Al0). A thermally pre&#8208;activated LiAlH4/Fe0 catalyst did not need an induction time and is also active at room temperature and 1 bar H2. A combination of AliBu3 and Fe0 is an even more active hydrogenation catalyst. Without pre&#8208;activation, tetra&#8208;substituted alkenes like Me2C=CMe2 and toluene could be fully hydrogenated.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The palladium catalyzed cyclotrimerization of ortho&#8208;silylaryl triflates as aryne precursors is meanwhile an established method to synthesize polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with triphenylene cores. During the palladium&#8208;catalyzed reaction of a pyrene with an o&#8208;silylaryl triflate moiety in the K&#8208;region, besides the expected trimer higher homologues with central eight&#8208; and ten&#8208;membered rings (the pyrenylenes) were found and a protocol developed to isolate all members of this series. This unprecedented new class of PAHs was fully investigated by all means, including X&#8208;ray diffraction of single&#8208;crystals, UV/vis and fluorescence spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. Furthermore, supported by density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations, a mechanism of all higher cyclooligomers is proposed.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We introduce a single&#8208;chain nanoparticle (SCNP) system capable of catalyzing the photooxidation of nonpolar alkenes up to three times more efficiently than an equivalent small&#8208;molecule photosensitizer at an identical concentration. Specifically, we construct a polymer chain constituted of poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate and glycidyl methacrylate which we compact via multifunctional thiol&#8208;epoxide ligation and functionalize with Rose Bengal (RB) in a one pot reaction, affording SCNPs with a hydrophilic shell and hydrophobic photocatalytic regions. Photooxidation of the internal alkene in oleic acid proceeds under green light. RB confined within the SCNP is three times more effective for nonpolar alkenes than free RB in solution, which we hypothesize is due to the spatial proximity of the photosensitizing units to the substrate in the hydrophobic region. Our approach demonstrates that SCNP based catalysts can afford enhanced photocatalysis via confinement effects in a homogeneous reaction environment.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Multiform Hollow&#8208;Structured Covalent Organic Frameworks via a Facile and Universal Strategy for Enhanced Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The special structural morphology of hollow covalent organic frameworks (HCOFs) has an important influence on their applications. However, the rapid and precise control of morphology for HCOFs still remains largely challenging. Herein, we present a facile and universal two&#8208;step strategy based on solvent evaporation and oxidation of imine bond for the controllable synthesis of HCOFs. The strategy enables to prepare HCOFs in a greatly shortened reaction time and seven kinds of HCOFs are fabricated by the oxidation of imine bond via hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) generated from Fenton reaction. Importantly, a fascinating library of HCOFs with diverse nanostructures, including bowl&#8208;like, yolk&#8208;shell, capsule&#8208;like and flower&#8208;like morphologies, has been ingeniously constructed. Owing to the large cavities, the obtained HCOFs are ideal candidates for drug delivery, which are employed to load five small molecule drugs, achieving the enhanced sonodynamic cancer therapy in vivo.</dc:description>

         <title>A Target Recycling Amplification Process for the Digital Detection of Exosomal MicroRNAs through Photonic Resonator Absorption Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A target recycling amplification process (TRAP) detection method was developed using photonic resonator absorption microscopy, which shows exciting potential for monitoring exosomal miRNAs with ultra&#8208;sensitivity and single&#8208;base mismatch selectivity. The approach is a single&#8208;step, wash&#8208;free, enzyme&#8208;free, isothermal, 20&#8208;minute, room temperature process that can be readily adapted toward any miRNA target through different DNA probe designs.







Abstract
Exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) have considerable potential as pivotal biomarkers to monitor cancer development, dis&#8208;ease progression, treatment effects and prognosis. Here, we report an efficient target recycling amplification process (TRAP) for the digital detection of miRNAs using photonic resonator absorption microscopy. We achieve multiplex digital detection with sub&#8208;attomolar sensitivity in 20&#8197;minutes, robust selectivity for single nucleotide variants, and a broad dynamic range from 1&#8197;aM to 1&#8197;pM. Compared with traditional qRT&#8208;PCR, TRAP showed similar accuracy in profiling exosomal miRNAs derived from cancer cells, but also exhibited at least 31&#8208;fold and 61&#8208;fold enhancement in the limits of miRNA&#8208;375 and miRNA&#8208;21 detection, respectively. The TRAP approach is ideal for exosomal or circulating miRNA biomarker quantification, where the miRNAs are present in low concentrations or sample volume, with potentials for frequent, low&#8208;cost, and minimally invasive point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing.

         <title>A Metabolic&#8208;Tag&#8208;Based Method for Assessing the Permeation of Small Molecules Across the Mycomembrane in Live Mycobacteria
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a method to systematically address the structural determinants of permeability in Mtb. This workflow, Peptidoglycan Accessibility Click&#8208;Mediated AssessmeNt (PAC&#8208;MAN), provides a screening platform to measure the permeation of any molecule that is modified with a small azide handle. When molecules reach the peptidoglycan layer, they react with DBCO (site selectively anchored by metabolic labeling), thus imprinting their permeation.







Abstract
The general lack of permeability of small molecules observed for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is most ascribed to its unique cell envelope. More specifically, the outer mycomembrane is hypothesized to be the principal determinant for access of antibiotics to their molecular targets. We describe a novel assay that combines metabolic tagging of the peptidoglycan, which sits directly beneath the mycomembrane, click chemistry of test molecules, and a fluorescent labeling chase step, to measure the permeation of small molecules. We showed that the assay workflow was robust and compatible with high&#8208;throughput analysis in mycobacteria by testing a small panel of azide&#8208;tagged molecules. The general trend is similar across the two types of mycobacteria with some notable exceptions. We anticipate that this assay platform will lay the foundation for medicinal chemistry efforts to understand and improve uptake of both existing drugs and newly&#8208;discovered compounds into mycobacteria.

         <title>Alkaline&#8208;Stable Anion&#8208;Exchange Membranes with Barium [2.2.2]Cryptate Cations: The Importance of High Binding Constants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex of [2.2.2]cryptand and Ba2+ is used as a novel cationic functional group for alkaline anion&#8208;exchange membrane applications, which synergistically has high binding constant, excellent alkaline stability, and a stable main&#8208;group&#8208;metal center.







Abstract
The stability of cationic functional groups is one of the key factors determining lifetime of alkaline anion&#8208;exchange membranes (AAEMs) and the AAEM&#8208;based electrochemical devices. Main&#8208;group metal and crown ether complexes are stable cations due to the absence of degradation pathways including nucleophilic substitution, Hofmann elimination, and cation redox. However, the binding strength, a key feature for AAEM applications, is overlooked in previous work. We herein propose the use of barium [2.2.2]cryptate ([Cryp&#8208;Ba]2+) as a new cationic functional group for AAEMs due to its extremely strong binding (109.5&#8197;M&#8722;1 in water at 25&#8201;&#176;C). The [Cryp&#8208;Ba]2+&#8208;AAEMs with polyolefin backbones remain stable after treatment in 15&#8197;M KOH at 60&#8201;&#176;C for over 1500&#8197;hours. More importantly, these AAEMs are successfully applied in water electrolyzers, and an anolyte&#8208;feeding switch method is designed to further reveal the influence of binding constants.

Cellulose separators have some challenges for their application in sodium&#8208;ion batteries: In their Research Article (e202300258), Xing&#8208;Long Wu and co&#8208;workers prepare a composite separator (CP@PPC) using cellulose paper (CP) cured by impregnation with polypropylene carbonate (PPC). With the assistance of PPC, CP@PPC not only opens up additional Na+ migration paths through a new &#8220;pore&#8208;hopping&#8221; transport mechanism, but also achieves a flexible, safe and environmental friendly high&#8208;performance separator.

         <title>Molecular Engineering To Enhance Reactivity and Selectivity in an Ultrafast Photoclick Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modification of the key parameters of the 9,10&#8208;phenanthrenequinone&#8208;electron&#8208;rich alkene (PQ&#8208;ERA) photocycloaddition has led to a system that combines PQs and enamines. This next&#8208;generation system shows drastically enhanced rates, high photoreaction quantum yields, tunable fluorescence output, and high fluorescence quantum yields of the adducts. Furthermore, an orthogonal reaction system was achieved in both solution and on nanoparticle surfaces.







Abstract
Light&#8208;induced 9,10&#8208;phenanthrenequinone&#8208;electron&#8208;rich alkene (PQ&#8208;ERA) photocycloadditions are an attractive new type of photoclick reaction, featuring fast conversions and high biocompatibility. However, the tunability of the reaction was hardly investigated up to now. To this end, we explored the influence of substituents on both reaction partners and the reaction rate between the PQs and ERAs. We identified new handles for functionalization and discovered that using enamines as ERAs leads to drastically enhanced rates (&gt;5400&#8197;times faster), high photoreaction quantum yields (&#934;P, up to 65&#8201;%), and multicolor emission output as well as a high fluorescence quantum yield of the adducts (&#934;F, up to 97&#8201;%). Further investigation of the photophysical and photochemical properties provided insights to design orthogonal reaction systems both in solution and on nanoparticle surfaces for ultrafast chemoselective functionalization by photoclick reactions.

         <title>Experimental Determination of an Isolated trans&#8208;Dinitrosyl Manganese(II) Heme Analogue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structure of a trans&#8208;dinitrosyl porphyrin complex [Mn(TPP)(NO)2] is reported. The complex was also characterized by FT&#8208;IR, EPR and DRIFT spectroscopy. The six&#8208;coordinate [Mn(TPP)(NO)2] complex shows distinct structural and spectroscopic features, including a much longer axial Mn&#8722;NNO bond and a higher NO stretching bond position than those of five&#8208;coordinate mononitrosyl analogues, as well as an isotropic resonance at g = 2.0.







Abstract
The lack of direct proof in either natural or synthetic systems for trans&#8208;dinitrosyl hemes, a key intermediate in the reactions of heme proteins (e.g. soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), cytochrome c&#8242; and So H&#8208;NOX) with nitric oxide (NO), has hampered understanding of the exact reaction mechanisms, such as the formation of the five&#8208;coordinate heme complex with NO at the proximal side (5c NOP). Herein, we report the first isolation of a dinitrosyl metalloporphyrin complex, the six&#8208;coordinate, low&#8208;spin {Mn(NO)2}7 species [Mn(TPP)(NO)2] (TPP2&#8722;=meso&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin dianion). The complex shows distinct features, such as an elongated axial bond (1.877(9) vs. 1.641(5)&#8197;&#197;), a higher NO stretching bond position (1760 vs. 1735&#8197;cm&#8722;1) and an isotropic resonance at g = 2.0, in sharp contrast to those of five&#8208;coordinate mononitrosyl analogues. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFT) and EPR studies provided deep insight into the reaction processes, demonstrating different responses of porphyrinates to NO.

         <title>Fundamental Understanding of Electronic Structure in FeN4 Site on Electrocatalytic Activity via dz2&#8208;Orbital&#8208;Driven Charge Tuning for Acidic Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a fundamental perspective on the electron structure of the FeN4 site on the acidic oxygen reduction reaction activity of a COPBTC@Cl&#8208;CNTs catalyst integrated into a proton exchange membrane fuel cell. Via 
&#8208;orbital&#8208;driven charge tuning, the performance of the fuel cell is improved by an order of magnitude compared with that of an untuned FeN4 catalyst.







Abstract
The structural diversity of active sites resulting from traditional pyrolysis hinder our understanding of the local coordination environment (LCE) around the active site, and its effects on performance in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). We created a series of FeN4 active&#8208;site configurations via a pyrolysis&#8208;free approach where LCEs are defined by covalent organic polymers (COPs). Our results suggest a more positive charge on iron atoms in the vicinity of an electron&#8208;withdrawing side&#8208;chain; that is, a high&#8208;valence configuration (FeH+N4) that is achieved with a COPBTC@Cl&#8208;CNTs catalyst subject to 
&#8208;orbital tuning. A new descriptor &#958;, defined as the band center of iron atoms projected on the 
&#8208;orbital, was introduced to quantitively explain a volcano&#8208;like regulation mechanism. When &#958; is distributed between &#8722;1.887 and &#8722;1.862&#8197;eV, the catalytic performance of the COPBTC@Cl&#8208;CNTs electrocatalyst is optimized.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Potassium Batteries Enabled by Electric and Thermal Field Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual regulation strategy of electric and thermal field in Potassium metal battery is realized by a highly ordered 1D CNT nanoarray. This unique electrode not only provides uniform K ion flux distribution, but also reduces the thermal fluctuation, therefore, enabling PMBs work at low temperature.







Abstract
Recharging batteries operate at sub&#8208;zero temperature is usually limited by the slow ion diffusion and uneven charge distribution at low temperature. Here, we report a strategy to regulate electric field and thermal field simultaneously, creating a fast and uniform deposition surroundings for potassium ion in potassium metal batteries (PMBs). This regulation is achieved by using a highly ordered 1D nanoarray electrode which provides a dense and flat surface for uniforming the electric field and high thermal conductivity for reducing the temperature fluctuation. Consequently, this electrode could achieve high&#8208;areal capacity of 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Besides, the dependence of potassium nucleation on temperature is unveiled. Furthermore, a full&#8208;cell could steady operate with over 80&#8201;% of its room&#8208;temperature capacity at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. Those respectable performances demonstrate that this strategy is valid, potentially providing guidelines for the rational design of advanced electrodes toward PMBs.

         <title>Tricrilactones A&#8211;H, Potent Antiosteoporosis Macrolides with Distinctive Ring Skeletons from Trichocladium crispatum, an Alpine Moss&#8208;Associated Fungus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of oligomeric 10&#8208;membered macrolides, tricrilactones A&#8211;H, was isolated from the moss&#8208;derived fungus T.&#8197;crispatum. Intermediate&#8208;trapping and isotope labeling experiments provided evidence for their proposed biosynthetic pathway. The compounds were found to be potent antiosteoporosis agents in vivo, whereby tricrilactone G (top right&#8208;hand structure) restored bone formation&#8208;resorption homeostasis and promoted cartilage and skeletal development.







Abstract
Tricrilactones A&#8211;H (1&#8211;8), a new family of oligomeric 10&#8208;membered macrolides featuring collectively five unique ring skeletons, were isolated from a hitherto unexplored fungus, Trichocladium crispatum. Compounds 1 and 7 contain two unconventional bridged (aza)tricyclic core skeletons, 2, 3, 5, and 6 share an undescribed tetracyclic 9/5/6/6 ring system, 4 bears an uncommon 9/5/6/10/3&#8208;fused pentacyclic architecture, and 8 is a dimer bridged by an unexpected C&#8722;C linkage. Their structures, including absolute configurations, were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis, quantum chemical calculations, and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Importantly, the absolute configuration of the highly flexible side chain of 1 was resolved by the asymmetric synthesis of its four stereoisomers. The intermediate&#8208;trapping and isotope labeling experiments facilitated the proposal of the biosynthetic pathway for these macrolides. In addition, their antiosteoporosis effects were evaluated in vivo (zebrafish).

         <title>Diastereoselective Alkylation of Activated Nitrogen Heterocycles with Alkenyl Boronate Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkylation of acylated quinolines and isoquinolines with alkenyl boron&#8208;&#8220;ate&#8221; complexes via 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangement gives substituted, dearomatized nitrogen heterocycles with high diastereocontrol. The modularity of this multi&#8208;component coupling allows for facile access to a range of valuable nitrogen&#8208;containing scaffolds. This one&#8208;pot protocol installs a chiral boronic ester moiety which can be used in further stereospecific transformations.







Abstract
Alkenyl boronate complexes react with acylated quinolines and isoquinolines via 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangement to give alkylated, dearomatized heterocycles in good yields, diastereoselectivities, and regioselectivities. This multi&#8208;component coupling is highly modular and can be used to access a wide scope of heterocyclic scaffolds. Chiral boronic esters made through this methodology possess high synthetic potential and can be transformed into various functional groups in one step without racemization.

         <title>Dithienylethene&#8208;Based Single Molecular Photothermal Linear Actuator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a mechanically controlled break junction (MCBJ) technique, we have demonstrated a single molecule&#8208;based photothermal linear actuator whose conductance remains constant during its operation. The actuation is achieved by the unique design of the molecular system, which allows a perfect balance of molecular length and band gap change upon isomerization that counteracts the effect of one another to give constant conductance with actuation.







Abstract
By employing a mechanically controllable break junction technique, we have realized an ideal single molecular linear actuator based on dithienylethene (DTE) based molecular architecture, which undergoes reversible photothermal isomerization when subjected to UV irradiation under ambient conditions. As a result, open form (compressed, UV OFF) and closed form (elongated, UV ON) of dithienylethene&#8208;based molecular junctions are achieved. Interestingly, the mechanical actuation is achieved without changing the conductance of the molecular junction around the Fermi level over several cycles, which is an essential property required for an ideal single molecular actuator. Our study demonstrates a unique example of achieving a perfect balance between tunneling width and barrier height change upon photothermal isomerization, resulting in no change in conductance but a change in the molecular length, which results in mechanical actuation at the single molecular level.

         <title>Hydrated Eutectic Electrolytes Stabilizing Quasi&#8208;Underpotential Mg Plating/Stripping for High&#8208;Voltage Mg Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable quasi&#8208;underpotential Mg stripping/plating chemistry (UPMC) on Zn substrate is initially achieved in new adiponitrile&#8208;based hydrated eutectic electrolytes (HEEs), realizing ultralow UPMC overpotentials and high energy/voltage plateau of aqueous rechargeable Mg batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable Mg batteries (ARMBs) usually fail from severe anode passivation, alternatively, executing quasi&#8208;underpotential Mg plating/stripping chemistry (UPMC) on a proper heterogeneous metal substrate is a crucial remedy. Herein, a stable UPMC on Zn substrate is initially achieved in new hydrated eutectic electrolytes (HEEs), delivering an ultralow UPMC overpotential and high energy/voltage plateau of ARMBs. The unique eutectic property remarkably expands the lower limit of electrochemical stability window (ESW) of HEEs and undermines the competition between hydrogen evolution/corrosion reactions and UPMC, enabling a reversible UPMC. The UPMC is carefully revealed by multiple characterizations, which shows a low overpotential of 50&#8197;mV at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over 550&#8197;h. With sulfonic acid&#8208;doped polyaniline (SPANI) cathodes, UPMC&#8208;based full cells show high energy/power densities of 168.6&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1/2.1&#8197;kWh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and voltage plateau of 1.3&#8197;V, far overwhelming conventional aqueous systems.

&lt;p&gt;Aqueous rechargeable Mg batteries (ARMBs) usually fail from severe anode passivation, alternatively, executing quasi-underpotential Mg plating/stripping chemistry (UPMC) on a proper heterogeneous metal substrate is a crucial remedy. Herein, a stable UPMC on Zn substrate is initially achieved in new hydrated eutectic electrolytes (HEEs), delivering an ultralow UPMC overpotential and high energy/voltage plateau of ARMBs. The unique eutectic property remarkably expands the lower limit of electrochemical stability window (ESW) of HEEs and undermines the competition between hydrogen evolution/corrosion reactions and UPMC, enabling a reversible UPMC. The UPMC is carefully revealed by multiple characterizations, which shows a low overpotential of 50&#8197;mV at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; over 550&#8197;h. With sulfonic acid-doped polyaniline (SPANI) cathodes, UPMC-based full cells show high energy/power densities of 168.6&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;/2.1&#8197;kWh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and voltage plateau of 1.3&#8197;V, far overwhelming conventional aqueous systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Single&#8208;Molecule Potentiometers Based on Stapled ortho&#8208; Oligo(phenylene)ethynylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stapled chiral helical single&#8208;molecule potentiometer based on ortho&#8208;oligophenylethynylene skeleton is described. Its stretching during STM measurements promotes different conductive pathways, attributed to different conformations of the helical scaffold, while maintaining the helicity. State of the art calculations on polarization pave the way to use these structures as unimolecular spin filters.







Abstract
We report on the chemical design of chiral molecular junctions with stress&#8208;dependent conductance, whose helicity is maintained during the stretching of a single molecule junction due to the stapling of both ends of the inner helix. In the reported compounds, different conductive pathways are observed, with clearly different conductance values and plateau&#8208;length distributions, attributed to different conformations of the helical structures. The large chiro&#8208;optical responses and the potential use of these molecules as unimolecular spin filters have been theoretically proved using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, including a fully ab&#8208;initio estimation of the CISS&#8208;originating spin polarization which is done, for the first time, for a realistic molecular system.

         <title>Molecular Mechanisms behind Acetylene Adsorption and Selectivity in Functional Porous Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview covers some state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art examples of advanced porous materials, namely metal&#8211;organic frameworks and decorated zeolites, that have been applied to the purification and storage of acetylene. It also discusses the challenges in translational research for the development of new solid sorbent&#8208;based separation technologies and highlights areas which require future research efforts.







Abstract
Since its first industrial production in 1890s, acetylene has played a vital role in manufacturing a wide spectrum of materials. Although current methods and infrastructures for various segments of acetylene industries are well&#8208;established, with emerging functional porous materials that enabled desired selectivity toward target molecules, it is of timely interest to develop new efficient technologies to promote safer acetylene processes with a higher energy efficiency and lower carbon footprint. In this Minireview, we, from the perspective of materials chemistry, review state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art examples of advanced porous materials, namely metal&#8211;organic frameworks and decorated zeolites, that have been applied to the purification and storage of acetylene. We also discuss the challenges on the roadmap of translational research in the development of new solid sorbent&#8208;based separation technologies and highlight areas which require future research efforts.

A reversible photo&#8208;induced single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal structural transformation was achieved for a mononuclear dysprosium&#8208;anthracene compound to form a 1D coordination polymer, accompanied by photoswitchable SMM properties with reduced effective spin&#8208;reversal energy barrier, narrowed butterfly&#8208;like hysteresis loop, and decreased blocking temperature.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;responsive lanthanide&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMM) hold great promise for future switching and memory devices. Herein, we report a dysprosium phosphonate [DyIII(SCN)2(NO3)(depma)2(4&#8208;hpy)2] (1Dy), which features a supramolecular framework containing layers of hydrogen&#8208;bonding network and pillars of &#960;&#8211;&#960; interacted anthracene units. The photocycloaddition reaction of anthracene pairs led to a rapid and reversible single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SC&#8211;SC) structural transition to form the 1D coordination polymer [DyIII(SCN)2(NO3)(depma2)(4&#8208;hpy)2]n (2Dy), accompanied by photoswitchable SMM properties with the reduction of effective energy barrier by half and the narrowing of the butterfly&#8208;like hysteresis loop. The diluted sample showed a photo&#8208;induced switch of the blocking temperature (TB) from 3.8&#8197;K for 1Dy@Y to 2.6&#8197;K for 2Dy@Y. This work may inspire the construction of lanthanide&#8208;based molecular materials with targeted photo&#8208;responsive magnetic properties.

         <title>pH&#8208; and Redox&#8208;Responsive Pickering Emulsions Based on Cellulose Nanocrystal Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of the electrostatic interactions between sulfated cellulose nanocrystals (CNC&#8208;OSO3&#8722;) and ferrocenium terminated polystyrene (PS&#8208;Fc+) at the oil&#8208;water interface has resulted in a new type of smart surfactant, termed CNC surfactants. pH&#8208; and redox responsive Pickering emulsions have been achieved by using the CNC surfactants as emulsifiers, with promising applications in encapsulation, biocatalysis, and micro&#8208;reactions.







Abstract
Nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs), formed by using dynamic interactions between nanoparticles and complementary ligands at the liquid&#8208;liquid interface, have emerged as &#8220;smart emulsifiers&#8221; with attributes of high emulsification efficiency, long&#8208;term stability, and on&#8208;demand emulsification/demulsification capabilities. However, only pH&#8208;responsiveness can be adopted for the assembly of reported NPSs formed by electrostatic interactions. Here, we propose an alternative design strategy, by taking advantage of the ferrocenium (Fc+) sulfate ion pair, to develop a new type of cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) surfactant. The Fc+ groups are sensitive to pH, redox reagents and voltage, imparting the CNC surfactants and derived Pickering emulsions with multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsiveness, and showing promising applications in controllable delivery, release, and biphasic biocatalysis.

         <title>A Robust Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Scalable Synthesis and Optimal Adsorption and Desorption for Energy&#8208;Efficient Ethylene Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel durable metal&#8208;organic framework ZU&#8208;901 with an ideal &#8220;S&#8221; shaped adsorption curve exhibits optimal adsorption and desorption behavior. It satisfies the basic criteria for potential industrial application: easy scale&#8208;up, low cost, and high stability. Benefiting from the continuous rapid ethylene/ethane adsorption&#8208;desorption performance, it is shown to be promising in the pressure&#8208;swing adsorption of ethylene and ethane.







Abstract
Adsorptive separation is an energy&#8208;efficient alternative, but its advancement has been hindered by the challenge of industrially potential adsorbents development. Herein, a novel ultra&#8208;microporous metal&#8208;organic framework ZU&#8208;901 is designed that satisfies the basic criteria raised by ethylene/ethane (C2H4/C2H6) pressure swing adsorption (PSA). ZU&#8208;901 exhibits an &#8220;S&#8221; shaped C2H4 curve with high sorbent selection parameter (65) and could be mildly regenerated. Through green aqueous&#8208;phase synthesis, ZU&#8208;901 is easily scalable with 99&#8201;% yield, and it is stable in water, acid, basic solutions and cycling breakthrough experiments. Polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 (99.51&#8201;%) could be obtained via a simulating two&#8208;bed PSA process, and the corresponding energy consumption is only 1/10 of that of simulating cryogenic distillation. Our work has demonstrated the great potential of pore engineering in designing porous materials with desired adsorption and desorption behavior to implement an efficient PSA process.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adsorptive separation is an energy-efficient alternative, but its advancement has been hindered by the challenge of industrially potential adsorbents development. Herein, a novel ultra-microporous metal-organic framework ZU-901 is designed that satisfies the basic criteria raised by ethylene/ethane (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) pressure swing adsorption (PSA). ZU-901 exhibits an &#8220;S&#8221; shaped C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; curve with high sorbent selection parameter (65) and could be mildly regenerated. Through green aqueous-phase synthesis, ZU-901 is easily scalable with 99&#8201;% yield, and it is stable in water, acid, basic solutions and cycling breakthrough experiments. Polymer-grade C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (99.51&#8201;%) could be obtained via a simulating two-bed PSA process, and the corresponding energy consumption is only 1/10 of that of simulating cryogenic distillation. Our work has demonstrated the great potential of pore engineering in designing porous materials with desired adsorption and desorption behavior to implement an efficient PSA process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Simple, Transition Metal Catalyst&#8208;Free Method for the Design of Complex Organic Building Blocks Used to Construct Porous Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new methodology for the synthesis of ligands for large pore metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), based on cyclic diamine building blocks, has been developed. Twenty&#8208;one new carboxylate ligands having 6 different geometries, as well as 16 new MOFs were synthesized.







Abstract
The design of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) having large pore sizes and volumes often requires the use of complex organic ligands, currently synthesized using costly and time&#8208;consuming palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling chemistry. Thus, in the present work, a new strategy for ligand design is reported, where piperazine and dihydrophenazine units are used as substitutes for benzene rings, which are the basic building block of most MOF ligands. This chemistry, which is based on simple, nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) reactions, is used for the transition metal catalyst&#8208;free construction of 21 new, carboxylate&#8208;based ligands with varying sizes, shapes, and denticity and 15 linear di&#8208; and tetra&#8208;nitriles. Moreover, to demonstrate the utility of the ligands as building blocks, 16 new structurally diverse MOFs having surface areas up to 3100&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 were also synthesized.

         <title>Molecular Alignment&#8208;Induced Chemically Patchy Uniaxial Nanoparticles and Their Applications in Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting and Self&#8208;Assembled Superstructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switchable particle patches were created by controlling the alignment of the molecules that form particles, and chemically patchy uniaxial nanoparticles were synthesized by synchronous polymerization and crystallization of liquid crystal monomers during precipitation polymerization. The resulting patchy particles have intriguing optical properties and show attractive applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting and the construction of superstructures.







Abstract
We report an unusual strategy for synthesizing patchy nanoparticles (NPs) by controlling the orientation of the molecules that form the NPs. This is realized by synchronous polymerization and crystallization of liquid crystal (LC) monomers during scalable precipitation polymerization. The resulting NPs are cylinders with highly uniform shapes and have only a single LC domain. The patchy properties originate from the discrepancy of surface chemical compositions on flat and side surfaces and can be switched on and off by solvent. Extra colloidal blocks can be grown onto the patches, resulting in highly uniform triblock patchy dumbbells, which have integrated optical properties, and as demonstrated, show triple&#8208;mode optical authentication in anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels or patterns. We also demonstrate that the triblock patchy cylinders are attractive building blocks for long LC rods or porous colloidal materials through polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly.

The one&#8208;electron oxidation converts the ferrocene&#8208;substituted borane into a Lewis Super&#8208;acid, as reported by Frank Breher, Jan Paradies et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202216959). The Lewis Super&#8208;acid activates almost inert carbon&#8211;fluorine and sulfur&#8211;fluorine bonds for reductions, alkylations and arylations in order to form new chemical bonds.

         <title>Unbiased Screening of Novel Infrared Nonlinear Optical Materials with High Thermal Conductivity: Long&#8208;neglected Nitrides and Popular Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unbiased high&#8208;throughput screening that merges thermal conductivity estimation is realized, infrared nonlinear optical materials with high thermal conductivity from 100&#8201;000&#8208;level compounds are discovered successfully. 106 compounds show well&#8208;balanced optical performances, including 81 with good thermal conductivity. And unreported chalcogenides with larger SHG response and nitrides with higher thermal conductivity are discovered.







Abstract
Traditional infrared (IR) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials such as AgGaS2 are crucial to key devices for solid&#8208;state lasers, however, low laser damage thresholds intrinsically hinder their practical application. Here, a robust strategy is proposed for unbiased high&#8208;throughput screening of more than 140&#8201;000 materials to explore novel IR NLO materials with high thermal conductivity and wide band gap which are crucial to intrinsic laser damage threshold. Via our strategy, 106 compounds with desired band gaps, NLO coefficients and thermal conductivity are screened out, including 8 nitrides, 68 chalcogenides, in which Sr2SnS4 is synthesized to verify the reliability of our process. Remarkably, thermal conductivity of nitrides is much higher than that of chalcogenides, e.g., 5&#215;AgGaS2 (5.13&#8197;W/m&#8201;K) for ZrZnN2, indicating that nitrides could be a long&#8208;neglected system for IR NLO materials. This strategy provides a powerful tool for searching NLO compounds with high thermal conductivity.

A Rh+/H8&#8208;binap complex catalyzes the chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective intermolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition of three unsymmetric 2&#960; components. The two&#8208;component [2+2+2] cycloaddition of two arylacetylenes and cis&#8208;enamides yields protected chiral cyclohexadienylamines. Replacing one arylacetylene with a silylacetylene enables the three&#8208;component [2+2+2] cycloaddition.







Abstract
We have developed the Rh+/H8&#8208;binap&#8208;catalyzed chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective intermolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition of three unsymmetric 2&#960; components. Thus, two arylacetylenes react with a cis&#8208;enamide to yield a protected chiral cyclohexadienylamine. Moreover, replacing one arylacetylene with a silylacetylene enables the [2+2+2] cycloaddition of three distinct unsymmetric 2&#960; components. These transformations proceed with excellent selectivity (complete regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity and up to &gt;99&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee). Mechanistic studies suggest the chemo&#8208; and regioselective formation of a rhodacyclopentadiene intermediate from the two terminal alkynes.

         <title>Synthesis of BaZrS3 and BaHfS3 Chalcogenide Perovskite Films Using Single&#8208;Phase Molecular Precursors at Moderate Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a single&#8208;phase, solution&#8208;processed approach to create thin films of BaZrS3 and BaHfS3 at temperatures of 575&#8201;&#176;C with sulfurization times as short as 20&#8197;min. To create molecular precursor inks, we utilized known carbon disulfide insertion chemistry to synthesize Group 4 metal dithiocarbamates and extended this chemistry to create species such as barium dithiocarboxylates, that have not been reported before.







Abstract
Chalcogenide perovskites have garnered interest for applications in semiconductor devices due to their excellent predicted optoelectronic properties and stability. However, high synthesis temperatures have historically made these materials incompatible with the creation of photovoltaic devices. Here, we demonstrate the solution processed synthesis of luminescent BaZrS3 and BaHfS3 chalcogenide perovskite films using single&#8208;phase molecular precursors at sulfurization temperatures of 575&#8201;&#176;C and sulfurization times as short as one hour. These molecular precursor inks were synthesized using known carbon disulfide insertion chemistry to create Group 4 metal dithiocarbamates, and this chemistry was extended to create species, such as barium dithiocarboxylates, that have never been reported before. These findings, with added future research, have the potential to yield fully solution processed thin films of chalcogenide perovskites for various optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Post&#8208;Assembly Modification of Homochiral Titanium&#8211;Organic Cages for Recognition and Separation of Molecular Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral metal&#8211;organic cage has been extended and introduced into a porous framework by using a post&#8208;assembly modification strategy. The microporous frameworks were successfully utilized for the recognition and separation of isomeric molecules, including aromatic compounds, nitriles, and chiral aromatic alcohols.







Abstract
A chiral metal&#8211;organic cage (MOC) was extended and fixed into a porous framework using a post&#8208;assembly modification strategy, which made it easier to study the host&#8211;guest chemistry of the solid&#8208;state MOC using a single&#8208;crystal diffraction technique. Anionic Ti4L6 (L=embonate) cage can be used as a 4&#8208;connecting crystal engineering tecton, and its optical resolution was achieved, thus homochiral &#916;&#916;&#916;&#916;&#8208; and &#923;&#923;&#923;&#923;&#8208;[Ti4L6] cages were obtained. Accordingly, a pair of homochiral cage&#8208;based microporous frameworks (PTC&#8208;236(&#916;) and PTC&#8208;236(&#923;)) were easily prepared by a post&#8208;assembly reaction. PTC&#8208;236 has rich recognition sites provided by the Ti4L6 moieties, chiral channels and high framework stability, affording a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation for guest structure analyses. Thus it was successfully utilized for the recognition and separation of isomeric molecules. This study provides a new approach for the orderly combination of well&#8208;defined MOCs into functional porous frameworks.

         <title>High&#8208;Porosity Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Glasses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) glasses of carboxylate linkages were synthesized by reacting Ti&#8208;oxo clusters with carboxylic acid linkers. The activated MOF glass showed a N2 Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller (BET) surface area of 923&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, nearly three times as high as the phenolate&#8208;linked MOF glass with the highest BET surface area prior to this report.







Abstract
We report a synthetic strategy to link titanium&#8208;oxo (Ti&#8208;oxo) clusters into metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) glasses with high porosity though the carboxylate linkage. A new series of MOF glasses was synthesized by evaporation of solution containing Ti&#8208;oxo clusters Ti16O16(OEt)32, linkers, and m&#8208;cresol. The formation of carboxylate linkages between the Ti&#8208;oxo clusters and the carboxylate linkers was confirmed by Fourier&#8208;transform infrared (FT&#8208;IR) spectroscopy. The structural integrity of the Ti&#8208;oxo clusters within the glasses was evidenced by both X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and 17O magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) NMR. After ligand exchange and activation, the fumarate&#8208;linked MOF glass, termed Ti&#8208;Fum, showed a N2 Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller (BET) surface areas of 923&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, nearly three times as high as the phenolate&#8208;linked MOF glass with the highest BET surface area prior to this report.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for C6 Alkane Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview summarizes the recent advancement in developing MOFs as energy&#8208;efficient adsorbents for the separation of C6 alkane isomers based on different separation mechanisms. Particular emphasis is made on the design and tailoring of their structures and pore properties to achieve optimal separation performance. Existing challenges and possible solutions, as well as future directions of this important research field is also discussed.







Abstract
The separation of alkane isomers is an important yet challenging process in the petrochemical industry. Being a crucial step to produce premium gasoline components as well as optimum ethylene feed, the current industrial separation by distillation is extremely energy intensive. Adsorptive separation based on zeolite is limited by insufficient adsorption capacity. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) hold enormous promise as alternative adsorbents due to their diverse structural tunability and exceptional porosity. Precise control of their pore geometry/dimensions has led to superior performance. In this minireview, we highlight the recent progresses in developing MOFs for the separation of C6 alkane isomers. Representative MOFs are reviewed based on their separation mechanisms. Emphasis is put on the material design rationale for achieving optimal separation capability. Finally, we briefly discuss the existing challenges, possible solutions, and future directions of this important field.

         <title>Pore Aperture Control Toward Size&#8208;Exclusion&#8208;Based Hydrocarbon Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sub&#8208;&#197;ngstrom tuning and control of pore aperture in metal&#8211;organic frameworks was achieved through expansion of linker dimensionality for selective separation of linear, monobranched, and dibranched hexane isomers.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been proposed as a promising material for non&#8208;thermal chemical separations owing to their high structural diversity and tunability. Here, we report the synthesis of a zinc&#8208;based MOF containing a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) linker, bicyclo[2.2.2]octane&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylic acid, with high thermal stability towards the separation of hexane isomers. The incorporation of the 3D linker enhances the structural stability and provides well&#8208;defined pore apertures/channels with sub&#8208;&#197;ngstrom precision. This precision allowed for the separation of similarly sized hexane isomers based on subtle differences in their kinetic diameters. Multi&#8208;component liquid phase batch experiments confirmed the separation of hexanes mixture into linear, monobranched, and dibranched isomers. This work represents a significant milestone in the construction of stable Zn&#8208;based MOFs and the incorporation of 3D linkers as a potential solution to challenging separations.

         <title>A Diode&#8208;Like Dye&#8208;Cu Anisotropic Junction in a Coordination Polymer as a Logic State Ratchet for Intratumor Redox Photomodulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By merging CuII ions and diphenylphenazine carboxylate ligands with discrete HOMO&#8211;LUMO dye sections, a multistable radical cationic coordination polymer with an anisotropic dye&#8208;Cu junction was constructed to achieve a diode&#8208;inspired unidirectional electron transfer and redox logic ratchet for the first time. Additionally, this material showed great potential for intratumor redox photomodulation for therapy. @ZhangTiexin







Abstract
Redox logic materials offer new avenues to modulate intracellular pathologic redox environment area&#8208;specifically, but the unambiguity of redox logic states and their unidirectional and repetitive switchability are challenging to realize. By merging a bistable diisophthalic phenazine dye ligand with CuII salt, a multistable coordination polymer (CP) was constructed, of which the dye&#8208;Cu anisotropic junction achieved the diode&#8208;like unidirectional electron transfer and logic state ratchet for the first time. Radical cationic CP maintained OFF status with low toxicity in healthy tissues, but was reduced to the neutral SERVO state by the overexpressed glutathione (GSH) in hypoxic tumors. After photoirradiation, the stabilized charge&#8208;separated ON status promoted photo&#8208;Fenton reaction for reactive oxygen species (ROS) signal transduction, and simultaneously recovered the initial state for catalytic signal amplification of ROS, furnishing intratumor redox photomodulation for therapy.

         <title>Direct &#960;&#8208;Activation vs. O&#8208;Activation in Halogen&#8208;Bonding Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halogen Bond (XB) donors are under active development in organocatalysis. In analogy to Hydrogen Bond (HB) donors, they have been considered to activate most organic substrates through the O&#8208;complexation of carbonyl groups. Our results suggest that direct &#960;&#8208;activation (i.e., of the &#960;&#8208;bond involved in the reaction) can be dominant in many cases of XB catalysis, largely altering our view on this type of catalysis.







Abstract
Halogen bond donors had an increasing impact on catalysis in recent years, and their development is highly active. In particular, numerous iodine&#8208;based halogen bond donors have been developed and used to promote various reactions through coordinating carbonyl groups, a ubiquitous mode of activation in catalysis. We now report computational data which strongly suggests that an alternative activation mode, through direct &#960;&#8208;complexation, is operative for unsaturated carbonyl substrates. Calculations also suggest that solvent polarity could have a clear impact on the preference of the mode of activation, raising the possibility of a mechanistic manifold switch through solvent variation. These findings could profoundly impact the development of the next generation of halogen&#8208;bond donor catalysts.

         <title>Sulfonyl&#8211;PYBOX Ligands Enable Kinetic Resolution of &#945;&#8208;Tertiary Azides by CuAAC</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the first highly selective kinetic resolution of racemic &#945;&#8208;chiral azides via Cu&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). Newly developed pyridine&#8211;bisoxazoline (PYBOX) ligands bearing a C4 sulfonyl group enable effective kinetic resolution of racemic azides derived from privileged scaffolds such as indanone, cyclopentenone and oxindole, and their asymmetric CuAAC to afford &#945;&#8208;tertiary 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles in high to excellent ee values. Theoretical studies by DFT calculation and control experiments reveal the role of C4 sulfonyl is to decrease the Lewis basicity of ligand to increase the electrophilicity of the copper center for better recognition of azides, and to function as a shielding group to make the chiral pocket of the catalyst more effective.</dc:description>

         <title>Study of intermolecular reconfiguration of flexible COF&#8208;5 film and its ultra&#8208;high chemiresistive humidity sensitivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, abundant active materials are developed to achieve the wearable detection of human body humidity. However, the limited response signal and sensitivity restrict further application due to their moderate affinity to water. Herein, we propose a flexible COF&#8208;5 film synthesized by a brief vapor&#8208;assisted method at room temperature. Intermediates are calculated by DTF simulation to investigate the interaction between COF&#8208;5 and water. The adsorption and desorption of water molecule result in a reversible deformation of COF layers while creating new conductive path by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. The as&#8208;prepared COF&#8208;5 films are applied to the flexible humidity sensors, exhibiting a resistance change in 4 orders of magnitude with remarkable linear relation between log function of resistance and relative humidity (RH) in 11%&#8208;98% RH range. Applications including respiratory monitoring and non&#8208;contact switch are tested, providing a promising prospect for the detection of human body humidity.</dc:description>

         <title>Multitargeted Platinum(IV) Anticancer Complexes Bearing Pyridinyl Ligands as Axial Leaving Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although multitargeted Pt(IV) anticancer prodrugs have shown significant activities in reducing drug resistance, the types of bioactive ligands and drugs that can be conjugated to the Pt center, remain limited to O&#8208;donors. Herein, we report the synthesis of Pt(IV) complexes bearing axial pyridines via ligand exchange reactions. Unexpectedly, the axial pyridines are quickly released after reduction, indicating their potential to be utilized as axial leaving groups. We further expand our synthetic approach to obtaining two multitargeted Pt(IV) prodrugs containing bioactive pyridinyl ligands: a PARP inhibitor and an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor; these conjugates exhibit great potential for overcoming drug resistance, and the latter conjugate inhibits the growth of Pt&#8208;resistant tumor in vivo. This research adds to the array of synthetic methods for accessing Pt(IV) prodrugs and significantly increases the types of bioactive axial ligands that can be conjugated to a Pt(IV) center.</dc:description>

         <title>Lewis Pairing&#8208;Induced Electrochemiluminescence Enhancement from Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Diads Decorated with Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane as an Electrochemical Protector</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study reports an effective peripheral decoration of organic donor&#8208;acceptor diads with B(C6F5)3 for stabilizing electrogenerated radical ions. By employing a common p&#8208;type organic semiconductor benzothienobenzothiophene (BTBT) as the donor, tetracoordinate boron complexes improved solution electrochemi&#8208;luminescence (ECL) intensity, reaching a 156&#8208;fold increase compared to that of the parent diad. The unprecedented Lewis pairing&#8208;induced ECL enhancement is attributed to the multiple roles of B(C6F5)3: 1) redistributing frontier orbitals, 2) facilitating electrochemical excitation, and 3) restricting molecular motions. Furthermore, B(C6F5)3 converted the molecular arrangement of BTBT from conventional 2D herringbones to 1D p&#8208;stacks. This robust, highly ordered columnar nanostructure allowed red&#8208;shifting of crystalline film ECL with electrochemical doping along the electronic coupling pathways of BTBT. Our approach will facilitate the development of elaborate metal&#8208;free ECL systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolation of&#160;Structurally&#160;Heterogeneous TCR&#8208;CD3 Extracellular Vesicle&#160;Subpopulations Using Caliper Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cells in different states can release diverse types of extracellular vesicles (EVs) that participate in intracellular communication or pathological processes. The identification and isolation of EV subpopulations are significant to explore their physiological functions and clinical value. In this study, structurally heterogeneous T&#8208;cell receptor (TCR)&#8208;CD3 EVs were proposed and verified for the first time using a caliper strategy. Two CD3&#8208;targeting aptamers were designed in the shape of a caliper with an optimized probe distance and were assembled on gold nanoparticles (Au&#8208;Caliper) to distinguish TCR&#8208;CD3 monomeric and dimeric EVs (m/dCD3 EVs) in skin&#8208;transplanted mouse plasma. Phenotyping and sequencing analysis revealed clear heterogeneity in the isolated m/dCD3 EVs, providing the potential for mCD3 EVs as a candidate biomarker of acute cellular rejection (ACR) and holding great prospects for distinguishing EV subpopulations based on protein oligomerization states.</dc:description>

         <title>Red Emissive Double Aza[7]helicenes with Antiaromaticity/Aromaticity Switching via the Redox&#8208;Induced Radical Cation and Dication Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein present the synthetic approach to a new antiaromatic double aza[7]helicene C that features NN&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This heteroatom&#8208;doped helicene showed a rarely obtained long&#8208;wavelength emission and far&#8208; red circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in the solid state. These optical and chiroptical properties could be ascribed to both the NN&#8208;PAH core structure and the further extension via angular ring fusions. Such a unique electronic structure also culminated in facile chemical oxidations of neutral C to the positively charged chiral radical (C&#8226;+) and dication species (C2+). Interestingly, DFT computations revealed that the pyridazine central core showed an antiaromaticity&#8208;to&#8208;aromaticity switching, in contrast to the inversed transition for the helical periphery in cationic states. The reported approaches are anticipated to further develop redox&#8208;active chiral systems for potential applications in chiroptoelectronics, spintronics as well as fluorescent bioimaging.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We developed a catalyst&#8208;free, atom&#8208;economical interfacial amino&#8208;yne click polymerization to in&#8208;situ synthesize new aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen)&#8208;based free&#8208;standing porous organic polymer films at room temperature. The crystalline properties of POP films were confirmed by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy. The good porosity of these POP films was proved by their N2 uptake experiments. The thickness of POP films can be easily regulated from 16 nm to ~1 &#956;m by adjusting monomer concentration. More importantly, these AIEgen&#8208;based POP films show bright luminescence with high absolute photoluminescent quantum yields up to 37.8% and good chemical and thermal stability. The AIEgen&#8208;based POP film can encapsulate an organic dye (e.g., Nile red) to further form an artificial light&#8208;harvesting system with a large red&#8208;shift (&#916;&#955; = 141 nm), highly efficient energy&#8208;transfer ability (&#934;ET = 91%), and high antenna effect (11.3).</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly as a Tool To Preserve the Electronic Purity of Perylene Diimide Chromophores
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Analysis of the photophysics of a supramolecular pseudo&#8208;cube formed from perylene diimide (PDI) chromophores shows that, in contrast to the rapid excited&#8208;state quenching observed upon uncontrolled aggregation of chromophores, the shape&#8208;persistent cage retains the electronic purity of the PDIs. This allows delayed fluorescence arising from an excited multimer to be observed and showcases molecular self&#8208;assembly as a powerful tool in organic electronics.







Abstract
Organic semiconductors are promising for efficient, printable optoelectronics. However, strong excited&#8208;state quenching due to uncontrolled aggregation limits their use in devices. We report on the self&#8208;assembly of a supramolecular pseudo&#8208;cube formed from six perylene diimides (PDIs). The rigid, shape&#8208;persistent cage sets the distance and orientation of the PDIs and suppresses intramolecular rotations and vibrations, leading to non&#8208;aggregated, monomer&#8208;like properties in solution and the solid state, in contrast to the fast fluorescence quenching in the free ligand. The stabilized excited state and electronic purity in the cage enables the observation of delayed fluorescence due to a bright excited multimer, acting as excited&#8208;state reservoir in a rare case of benign inter&#8208;chromophore interactions in the cage. We show that self&#8208;assembly provides a powerful tool for retaining and controlling the electronic properties of chromophores, and to bring molecular electronics devices within reach.

         <title>Open&#8208;Cage Fullerene as a Selective Molecular Trap for LiF/[BeF]+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An open&#8208;cage fullerene derivative (trap) was prepared with a hydroxy group (bait/hook) pointing towards the center of the cavity and a diphenyl pocket above the 21&#8208;membered orifice. The hydroxy group could coordinate lithium and beryllium cations, which led to the encapsulation of LiF and [BeF]+ in the fullerene. The hydroxy group was also shown to form hydrogen bonds with molecules such as water, methanol, and ethanol in the diphenyl pocket.







Abstract
The insertion of ionic compounds into open&#8208;cage fullerenes is a challenging task due to the electropositive nature of the cavity. The present work reports the preparation of an open&#8208;cage C60 derivative with a hydroxy group pointing towards the centre of the cavity, which can coordinate to a metal cation, thus acting as a bait/hook to trap the metal cation such as the lithium cation in neutral LiF and the beryllium cation in the cationic [BeF]+ species. Other metal salts could not be inserted under similar conditions. The structure of MF in the cage was unambiguously determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Owing to its tendency to undergo polycoordination, Li+ monomer salts have not been isolated before, despite extensive research on Li bonds. The present results provide a unique example of a Li bond.

         <title>Controlling the Fluorescence Performance of AIE Polymers by Controlling the Polymer Microstructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling fluorescence efficiency is achieved without changing emission wavelength/color by controlling the (co)polymer chemical structures/physical properties, including molecular weight, crystallinity, monomer composition, glass transition temperature, side length, and flexibility/rigidity of the chain.







Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) polymers with expected emission wavelength/color and fluorescence efficiency are valuable in applications. However, most AIE polymers exhibit irregular emission wavelength/color changes compared to the original AIE monomers. Here, we report the synthesis of AIE polymers with unchanged emission wavelength by ring&#8208;opening (co)polymerizations of 4&#8208;(triphenylethenyl)phenoxymethyloxirane (TPEO) and other epoxides or phthalic anhydride. The chemical structures/physical properties of all (co)polymers were characterized by NMR, SEC, MALDI&#8208;TOF, and DSC. The co&#8208;polyether microstructures were revealed by calculating the reactivity ratios and visualized by Monte Carlo simulation. The photoluminescence quantum yields of all the (co)polymers were determined in the solid state. We systematically correlated the fluorescence performance with molecular weights, crystallinity, monomer compositions, glass transition temperatures, side lengths, and flexibility/rigidity.

         <title>Porous and Water Stable 2D Hybrid Metal Halide with Broad Light Emission and Selective H2O Vapor Sorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous and water&#8208;stable hybrid semiconductors pose as multifunctional materials combining traits that are essential for demanding commercial applications. A strategy for generating porosity in hybrid metal halide semiconductors by using molecular cages as both structure&#8208;directing agents and counter&#8208;cations is reported. This strategy gave rise to a direct band gap semiconductor, with record water stability and selective vapor&#8208;sorption.







Abstract
In this work we report a strategy for generating porosity in hybrid metal halide materials using molecular cages that serve as both structure&#8208;directing agents and counter&#8208;cations. Reaction of the [2.2.2] cryptand (DHS) linker with PbII in acidic media gave rise to the first porous and water&#8208;stable 2D metal halide semiconductor (DHS)2Pb5Br14. The corresponding material is stable in water for a year, while gas and vapor&#8208;sorption studies revealed that it can selectively and reversibly adsorb H2O and D2O at room temperature (RT). Solid&#8208;state NMR measurements and DFT calculations verified the incorporation of H2O and D2O in the organic linker cavities and shed light on their molecular configuration. In addition to porosity, the material exhibits broad light emission centered at 617&#8197;nm with a full width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 284&#8197;nm (0.96&#8197;eV). The recorded water stability is unparalleled for hybrid metal halide and perovskite materials, while the generation of porosity opens new pathways towards unexplored applications (e.g. solid&#8208;state batteries) for this class of hybrid semiconductors.

We report activation of aryl halides at gold(I) enabled by NHC (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) ligands through the design of a new class of L&#8208;shaped heterobidentate ImPy (ImPy=imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene) N,C ligands that feature hemilabile character of the amino group in a locked conformation. Experimental and DFT studies demonstrate pivotal stabilization of AuIII species by the hemilabile nitrogen for successful AuI/AuIII catalysis.







Abstract
In the last decade, major advances have been made in homogeneous gold catalysis. However, AuI/AuIII catalytic cycle remains much less explored due to the reluctance of AuI to undergo oxidative addition and the stability of the AuIII intermediate. Herein, we report activation of aryl halides at gold(I) enabled by NHC (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) ligands through the development of a new class of L&#8208;shaped heterobidentate ImPy (ImPy=imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene) N,C ligands that feature hemilabile character of the amino group in combination with strong &#963;&#8208;donation of the carbene center in a rigid conformation, imposed by the ligand architecture. Detailed characterization and control studies reveal key ligand features for AuI/AuIII redox cycle, wherein the hemilabile nitrogen is placed at the coordinating position of a rigid framework. Given the tremendous significance of homogeneous gold catalysis, we anticipate that this ligand platform will find widespread application.

         <title>Perfluoroalkyl Selenoxides, Selenones and Selenoximines: General Preparation and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Access to perfluoroalkyl selenoxides, selenones and selenoximines was possible through a selective oxidation of perfluoroalkyl selenoethers. Synthesis of perfluoroalkyl selenoxides was also described via a two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot reaction from selenocyanates. The perfluoroalkyl selenoximine family was synthesized. The Hansch&#8208;Leo parameters of the compounds were determined and some aryl perfluoroalkyl selenoxides were separated by chiral HPLC.







Abstract
A selective access to perfluoroalkyl selenoxides, via Oxone&#174; as oxidant or to selenones by using a Polyoxometalate&#8208;based Ionic Liquid (POM&#8208;IL) as a catalyst for the oxidation step is described. The reaction works with various perfluoralkyl chains and substituents with satisfactory to excellent yields. A two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot reaction from selenocyanates was performed to gain access to perfluoroalkyl selenoxides. The previously unknown perfluoroalkyl selenoximines family was also prepared with good yields. Having unlocked two strategies for the synthesis of fluoroalkylated SeIV and SeVI compounds, we then evaluated the Hansch&#8208;Leo lipophilicity parameters of these groups. Finally, asymmetric aryl perfluoroalkyl selenoximines were resolved to determine their absolute configurations.

         <title>A Polymeric Extracellular Matrix Nanoremodeler for Activatable Cancer Photo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semiconducting polymer&#8208;based extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeler (SPNcb) with photodynamic antitumor activity and inhibition of collagen&#8208;crosslinking enzymes is developed for activatable cancer photo&#8208;immunotherapy. SPNcb&#8208;mediated ECM&#8208;remodeling therapy synergizes with checkpoint blockade immunotherapy to reinvigorate cytotoxic T cell&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity, inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis.







Abstract
Cancer immunotherapy has shown tremendous potential to train the intrinsic immune system against malignancy in the clinic. However, the extracellular matrix (ECM) in tumor microenvironment is a formidable barrier that not only restricts the penetration of therapeutic drugs but also prevents the infiltration of antitumor immune cells. We herein report a semiconducting polymer&#8208;based ECM nanoremodeler (SPNcb) to combine photodynamic antitumor activity with cancer&#8208;specific inhibition of collagen&#8208;crosslinking enzymes (lysyl oxidase (LOX) family) for activatable cancer photo&#8208;immunotherapy. SPNcb is self&#8208;assembled from an amphiphilic semiconducting polymer conjugated with a LOX inhibitor (&#946;&#8208;aminopropionitrile, BAPN) via a cancer biomarker (cathepsin B, CatB)&#8208;cleavable segment. BAPN can be exclusively activated to inhibit LOX activity in the presence of the tumor&#8208;overexpressed CatB, thus blocking collagen crosslinking and decreasing ECM stiffness. Such an ECM nanoremodeler synergizes immunogenic phototherapy and checkpoint blockade immunotherapy to improve the tumor infiltration of cytotoxic T cells, inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis.

         <title>Benzotrithiophene&#8208;based Covalent Organic Framework Photocatalysts with Controlled Conjugation of Building Blocks for Charge Stabilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzotrithiophene (BTT) based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were prepared with different electron accepting units, which could be attributable to the photocatalytic reduction reaction. Based on both experimental results and theoretical calculations, the photocatalytic performance of BTT&#8208;COFs closely depended on the electron affinity and charge trapping of the electron accepting units.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks have recently shown high potential for photocatalytic hydrogen production. However, their structure&#8208;property&#8208;activity relationship has not been sufficiently explored to identify a research direction for structural design. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of four benzotrithiophene (BTT)&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with different conjugations of building units, and their photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production. All four BTT&#8208;COFs had slipped parallel stacking patterns with high crystallinity and specific surface areas. The change in the degree of conjugation was found to rationally tune the rate of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

     alt="Benzotrithiophene-based Covalent Organic Framework Photocatalysts with Controlled Conjugation of Building Blocks for Charge Stabilization"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benzotrithiophene (BTT) based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were prepared with different electron accepting units, which could be attributable to the photocatalytic reduction reaction. Based on both experimental results and theoretical calculations, the photocatalytic performance of BTT-COFs closely depended on the electron affinity and charge trapping of the electron accepting units.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic frameworks have recently shown high potential for photocatalytic hydrogen production. However, their structure-property-activity relationship has not been sufficiently explored to identify a research direction for structural design. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of four benzotrithiophene (BTT)-based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with different conjugations of building units, and their photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production. All four BTT-COFs had slipped parallel stacking patterns with high crystallinity and specific surface areas. The change in the degree of conjugation was found to rationally tune the rate of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Based on the experimental and calculation results, the tunable photocatalytic performance could be mainly attributed to the electron affinity and charge trapping of the electron accepting units. This study provides important insights for designing covalent organic frameworks for efficient photocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Double Atomic&#8208;Tuned RuBi SAA/Bi@OG Nanostructure with Optimum Charge Redistribution for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double atomic&#8208;tuned RuBi SAA/Bi@OG nanostructure was prepared by one&#8208;step pyrolysis method. The electron density on surface of Ru nanoparticle can be synergistically modulated by alloyed Bi single atom and adjacent Bi&#8722;O single site leading to optimum charge redistribution. Thus, the resulting RuBi SAA/Bi@OG exhibits superior alkaline HER activity.







Abstract
Charge redistribution on surface of Ru nanoparticle can significantly affect electrocatalytic HER activity. Herein, a double atomic&#8208;tuned RuBi SAA/Bi@OG nanostructure that features RuBi single&#8208;atom alloy nanoparticle supported by Bi&#8722;O single&#8208;site&#8208;doped graphene was successfully developed by one&#8208;step pyrolysis method. The alloyed Bi single atom and adjacent Bi&#8722;O single site in RuBi SAA/Bi@OG can synergistically manipulate electron transfer on Ru surface leading to optimum charge redistribution. Thus, the resulting RuBi SAA/Bi@OG exhibits superior alkaline HER activity. Its mass activity is up to 65000&#8197;mA&#8201;mg&#8722;1 at an overpotential of 150&#8197;mV, which is 72.2&#8197;times as much as that of commercial Pt/C. DFT calculations reveal that the RuBi SAA/Bi@OG possesses the optimum charge redistribution, which is most beneficial to strengthen adsorption of water and weaken hydrogen&#8208;adsorption free energy in HER process. This double atomic&#8208;tuned strategy on surface charge redistribution of Ru nanoparticle opens a new way to develop highly efficient electrocatalysts.

The in situ polymerization of solid&#8208;state dioxolane electrolytes on interconnected CNTs and active materials is the key to realize excellent interfacial contact. Electrons/ions enable full access to active materials in the whole electrode. Therefore, the integrated batteries demonstrated high energy density, amazing charge/discharge rate and long cycle life.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium batteries are promising and safe energy storage devices for mobile electronics and electric vehicles. In this work, we report a facile in situ polymerization of 1,3&#8208;dioxolane electrolytes to fabricate integrated solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. The in situ polymerization and formation of solid&#8208;state dioxolane electrolytes on interconnected carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and active materials is the key to realizing a high&#8208;performance battery with excellent interfacial contact among CNTs, active materials and electrolytes. Therefore, the electrodes could be tightly integrated into batteries through the CNTs and electrolyte. Electrons/ions enable full access to active materials in the whole electrode. Electrodes with a low resistance of 4.5&#8197;&#937;&#8201;&#9633;&#8722;1 and high lithium&#8208;ion diffusion efficiency of 2.5&#215;10&#8722;11&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1 can significantly improve the electrochemical kinetics. Subsequently, the batteries demonstrated high energy density, amazing charge/discharge rate and long cycle life.

         <title>Metalla&#8208;Claisen Rearrangement in Gold&#8208;Catalyzed [4+2] Reaction: A New Elementary Reaction Suggested for Future Reaction Design</title>

We report the first computational evidence for the involvement of metalla&#8208;Claisen Rearrangement (MCR) in the gold&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] reaction of yne&#8208;dienes, together with detailed analysis of different pathways and their competition.

Abstract
We report here computational evidence for a metalla&#8208;Claisen rearrangement (MCR) in the case of gold&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] cycloaddition reaction of yne&#8208;dienes. The [4+2] reaction starts from exo cyclopropanation, followed by MCR and reductive elimination. The cyclopropane moiety formed in the first step is crucial for a low barrier of the MCR step. In addition, the importance of an appropriate combination of the tether group and the terminal substituent on alkyne in the yne&#8208;diene substrates was studied. The mechanism of rhodium&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] reaction of yne&#8208;dienes was also investigated to see whether an MCR mechanism is involved or not. The findings and new understanding hereby reported represent an important advance in the catalysis field.

         <title>Stereospecific Oxycyanation of Alkenes with Sulfonyl Cyanide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermolecular oxycyanation of alkenes using p&#8208;toluenesulfonyl cyanide (TsCN) in the presence of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (B(C6F5)3) as a catalyst was shown to be feasible. The developed method offers a simple, scalable, and straightforward approach to access synthetically useful &#946;&#8208;hydroxy nitrile derivatives.







Abstract
Oxycyanation of alkenes would allow the direct construction of useful &#946;&#8208;hydroxy nitrile scaffolds. However, only limited examples of such reactions have been reported, and some problems including limited substrate scope and the lack of diastereocontrol in the case of the oxycyanation of internal alkenes have arisen. We herein report on the intermolecular oxycyanation of alkenes using p&#8208;toluenesulfonyl cyanide (TsCN) in the presence of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (B(C6F5)3) as a catalyst, affording products that contain a sulfinyloxy group and a cyano group at the vicinal position. The reaction features a stereospecific syn&#8208;addition. The reaction also shows a broad substrate scope with good functional group tolerance. Mechanistic investigations by experimental studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the reaction proceeds via an unprecedented stereospecific mechanism through the electrophilic cyanation of alkenes, in which B(C6F5)3 efficiently activates TsCN through the coordination of the cyano group to the boron center.

         <title>Bandgap&#8208;Engineered Germanene Nanosheets as an Efficient Photodynamic Agent for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
H&#8208;terminated germanene nanosheets with a biomedically favorable direct band gap were synthesized by a simple surface chemical modulation and can be applied to cancer photodynamic therapy (PDT). The surface chemical modulation strategy addresses the major medical application challenges of Xenes in reactive oxygen species (ROS) science.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) monoelemental materials (Xenes) show considerable potential in bioapplications owing to their unique 2D physicochemical features and the favored biosafety resulting from their monoelemental composition. However, the narrow band gaps of Xenes prevent their broad applications in biosensors, bioimaging and phototherapeutics. In this study, it is demonstrated that 2D germanene terminated with &#8722;H via surface chemical engineering, shows a much broadened direct band gap of 1.65&#8197;eV, which enables the material to be used as a novel inorganic photosensitizer for the photodynamic therapy of singlet oxygen. Through theoretical analysis and in vitro studies, H&#8208;germanene nanosheets demonstrate a substantially enlarged band gap and favorable biodegradability, demonstrating a substantial cancer treatment capacity. This study demonstrates the feasibility of constructing novel therapeutic photodynamic agents by surface covalent engineering for catalytic tumor therapy.

         <title>Long&#8208;Lived Multiple Charge Separation by Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple charge separation with a long lifetime has been realized in an organic cocrystal by a proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer reaction under irradiation with light. The enhanced absorption toward longer wavelengths can be applied for near&#8208;infrared imaging and bacterial inhibition.







Abstract
Multiple charge separation has been successfully realized by a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer reaction in an organic cocrystal. Benefiting from the adjustable electronic energy level of the electron donor and acceptor through thermal&#8208;induced proton migration, distinct optical absorption behaviors combined with color changes to blue or green are observed in these charge&#8208;separated states. It is of interest to note that such charge&#8208;separated states exhibit a longer lifetime of over a month as a result of the excellent coplanarity and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction of the electron acceptors. Moreover, the enhanced absorption toward longer wavelengths endows the charge&#8208;separated state with near&#8208;infrared (808&#8197;nm) photothermal conversion for imaging and bacterial inhibition, whereby the conversion performance can be controlled by the degree of proton migration.

         <title>A Symmetry&#8208;Broken Charge&#8208;Separated State in the Marcus Inverted Region</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the Marcus&#8208;inverted&#8208;region&#8208;assisted evolution of a long&#8208;lived symmetry&#8208;broken charge&#8208;separated state in a near&#8208;orthogonal bichromophoric system consisting of perylenediimide dimers.







Abstract
We report a long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated state in a chromophoric pair (DC&#8208;PDI2) that uniquely integrates the advantages of fundamental processes of photosynthetic reaction centers: i) Symmetry&#8208;breaking charge&#8208;separation (SB&#8208;CS) and ii) Marcus&#8208;inverted&#8208;region dependence. The near&#8208;orthogonal bichromophoric DC&#8208;PDI2 manifests an ultrafast evolution of the SB&#8208;CS state with a time constant of 
=0.35&#177;0.02&#8197;ps and a slow charge recombination (CR) kinetics with 
=4.09&#177;0.01&#8197;ns in ACN. The rate constant of CR of DC&#8208;PDI2 is 11&#8201;686 times slower than SB&#8208;CS in ACN, as the CR of the PDI radical ion&#8208;pair occurs in the deep inverted region of the Marcus parabola (
&gt;&#955;). In contrast, an analogous benzyloxy (BnO)&#8208;substituted DC&#8208;BPDI2 showcases a &#8776;10&#8208;fold accelerated CR kinetics with 
 lowering to &#8776;1536 in ACN, by virtue of a decreased CR driving force. The present investigation demonstrates a control of molecular engineering to tune the energetics and kinetics of the SB&#8208;CS material, which is essential for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Radical&#8208;Bridged Heterometallic Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets Incorporating Four Lanthanoceniums</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical&#8208;bridged organometallic heterometallic single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) were isolated for the first time, representing a new class of organometallic lanthanide (Ln) SMMs. The novel strategy effectively overcomes the limited number of metal centers in radical&#8208;bridged Ln&#8208;SMMs, opening up new ways to construct larger strongly coupled Ln&#8208;SMMs.







Abstract
The syntheses and magnetic properties of organometallic heterometallic compounds [K(THF)6]{CoI[(&#956;3&#8208;HAN)RE2Cp*4]2} (1&#8208;RE) and [K(Crypt)]2{CoI[(&#956;3&#8208;HAN)RE2Cp*4]2} (2&#8208;RE) containing hexaazatrinaphthylene radicals (HAN&#8901;3&#8722;) and four rare earth (RE) ions are reported. 1&#8208;RE shows isolable species with ligand&#8208;based mixed valency as revealed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) thus leading to the isolation of 2&#8208;RE via one&#8208;electron chemical reduction. Strong electronic communication in mixed&#8208;valency supports stronger overall ferromagnetic behaviors in 2&#8208;RE than 1&#8208;RE containing Gd and Dy ions. Ac magnetic susceptibility data reveal 1&#8208;Dy and 2&#8208;Dy both exhibit slow magnetic relaxation. Importantly, larger coercive field was observed in the hysteresis of 2&#8208;Dy at 2.0&#8197;K, indicating the enhanced SMM behavior compared with 1&#8208;Dy. Ligand&#8208;based mixed&#8208;valency strategy has been used for the first time to improve the magnetic coupling in lanthanide (Ln) SMMs, thus opening up new ways to construct strongly coupled Ln&#8208;SMMs.

         <title>Electrothermal Water&#8208;Gas Shift Reaction at Room Temperature with a Silicomolybdate&#8208;Based Palladium Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrothermal water&#8208;gas shift reaction was achieved with a system comprised of a Pd single&#8208;atom catalyst and redox mediator, simplifying the separation of products and avoiding the use of alkaline electrolyte. The reduction degree of the redox mediator was a key effect in modifying the reaction kinetics and performance of both thermal&#8208; and electrocatalytic reaction steps.







Abstract
The water&#8208;gas shift (WGS) reaction is often conducted at elevated temperature and requires energy&#8208;intensive separation of hydrogen (H2) from methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and residual carbon monoxide (CO). Designing processes to decouple CO oxidation and H2 production provides an alternative strategy to obtain high&#8208;purity H2 streams. We report an electrothermal WGS process combining thermal oxidation of CO on a silicomolybdic acid (SMA)&#8208;supported Pd single&#8208;atom catalyst (Pd1/CsSMA) and electrocatalytic H2 evolution. The two half&#8208;reactions are coupled through phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) as a redox mediator at a moderate anodic potential of 0.6&#8197;V (versus Ag/AgCl). Under optimized conditions, our catalyst exhibited a TOF of 1.2&#8197;s&#8722;1 with turnover numbers above 40&#8201;000&#8197;mol
&#8201;molPd&#8722;1 achieving stable H2 production with a purity consistently exceeding 99.99&#8201;%.

Designing processes to decouple CO oxidation and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production provides an alternative strategy to obtain high-purity H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; streams. We report an electrothermal WGS process combining thermal oxidation of CO on a silicomolybdic acid (SMA)-supported Pd single-atom catalyst (Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/CsSMA) and electrocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution. The two half-reactions are coupled through phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) as a redox mediator at a moderate anodic potential of 0.6&#8197;V (versus Ag/AgCl). Under optimized conditions, our catalyst exhibited a TOF of 1.2&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with turnover numbers above 40&#8201;000&#8197;mol
&#8201;mol&lt;sub&gt;Pd&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; achieving stable H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production with a purity consistently exceeding 99.99&#8201;%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

DNA&#8208;based particles with various morphologies and functions are fabricated via the supramolecular assembly of tannic acid (TA) and DNA. The engineered particles enable in vivo co&#8208;delivery of adjuvant/antigen to boost cytokine and antibody production.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;based materials have attracted interest due to the tunable structure and encoded biological functionality of nucleic acids. A simple and general approach to synthesize DNA&#8208;based materials with fine control over morphology and bioactivity is important to expand their applications. Here, we report the synthesis of DNA&#8208;based particles via the supramolecular assembly of tannic acid (TA) and DNA. Uniform particles with different morphologies are obtained using a variety of DNA building blocks. The particles enable the co&#8208;delivery of cytosine&#8208;guanine adjuvant sequences and the antigen ovalbumin in model cells. Intramuscular injection of the particles in mice induces antigen&#8208;specific antibody production and T cell responses with no apparent toxicity. Protein expression in cells is shown using capsules assembled from TA and plasmid DNA. This work highlights the potential of TA as a universal material for directing the supramolecular assembly of DNA into gene and vaccine delivery platforms.

         <title>Differentiating between Acidic and Basic Surface Hydroxyls on Metal Oxides by Fluoride Substitution: A Case Study on Blue TiO2 from Laser Defect Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Probing surface OH with F&#8722; ions: Surface OH of TiO2 were substituted by F&#8722; ions, which were then quantified by XPS and ion chromatography. The acidic (bridging) and basic (terminal) surface OH can be distinguished at different pH. Using this fluoride substitution, it was demonstrated that laser defect engineering selectively created more acidic OH but not basic OH on TiO2.







Abstract
Both oxygen vacancies and surface hydroxyls play a crucial role in catalysis. Yet, their relationship is not often explored. Herein, we prepare two series of TiO2 (rutile and P25) with increasing oxygen deficiency and Ti3+ concentration by pulsed laser defect engineering in liquid (PUDEL), and selectively quantify the acidic and basic surface OH by fluoride substitution. As indicated by EPR spectroscopy, the laser&#8208;generated Ti3+ exist near the surface of rutile, but appear to be deeper in the bulk for P25. Fluoride substitution shows that extra acidic bridging OH are selectively created on rutile, while the surface OH density remains constant for P25. These observations suggest near&#8208;surface Ti3+ are highly related to surface bridging OH, presumably the former increasing the electron density of the bridging oxygen to form more of the latter. We anticipate that fluoride substitution will enable better characterization of surface OH and its correlation with defects in metal oxides.

         <title>Nanoconfinement&#8208;Guided Construction of Nanozymes for Determining H2O2 Produced by Sonication</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided by the nanoconfinement effect, cytochrome&#8197;c (Cyt&#8201;c) has been successfully confined within a hierarchical MOF scaffold, PCN&#8208;222, leading to a 3&#8211;4&#8208;fold improvement in its peroxidase&#8208;mimicking activity. The fabricated Cyt&#8201;c@PCN&#8208;222 nanoparticles were further employed to sensitively monitor sonication&#8208;induced H2O2.







Abstract
Nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like activities, termed as nanozymes, have found wide applications in various fields. It has been a long&#8208;term aim to rationally design and synthesize highly active nanozymes and thus to further improve their application performance. Guided by the nanoconfinement effect, we confine cytochrome c (Cyt&#8201;c) within a mesoporous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), PCN&#8208;222 nanoparticle (NP), forming a protein/MOF hybrid nanozyme, termed as Cyt&#8201;c@PCN&#8208;222 NP. The confined Cyt&#8201;c exhibits around 3&#8211;4&#8208;fold higher peroxidase&#8208;like activity than free Cyt&#8201;c. Due to the increase in the activity of Cyt&#8201;c, the Cyt&#8201;c@PCN&#8208;222 NPs exhibit a quite low limit of detection (&#8776;0.13&#8197;&#956;M) towards H2O2. Sonication&#8208;induced H2O2 formation in water by using a lab&#8208;quipped ultrasonic cleaner can be sensitively probed, which suggests that H2O2&#8208;sensitive materials should be carefully handled during the utilization of ultrasonic equipment. We speculate that this nanoconfinement strategy can broaden our synthetic methodology for the rational design of nanozymes.

         <title>A Substituted&#8208;Rhodamine&#8208;Based Reversible Fluorescent Probe for In Vivo Quantification of Glutathione</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantifying glutathione (GSH) in cells and organisms by bioimaging is achieved by using ZpSiP, a substituted&#8208;rhodamine&#8208;based ratiometric probe with reliable reactivity with GSH. The probe succeeded in monitoring the dynamics of GSH in the organisms bearing tumor tissues, chronic renal failure, and liver fibrosis, and thus unveiling the related pathological processes and mechanisms.







Abstract
Quantifying glutathione (GSH) in cells and organisms is of great significance for understanding the mechanism of oxidative stress in various physiological and pathological processes. However, the quantification by fluorescence bioimaging in living tissues has much stricter requirements than the &#8220;Petri dish&#8221;&#8208;cultured cells in flat plates. Based on the evaluation of the electronic structure and steric hindrance&#8208;tuned reactivity of phospha&#8208;substituted rhodamine with GSH, a reversible F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) probe ZpSiP with a distinct performance (Kd=4.9&#8197;mM, t1/2=0.57&#8197;s, k=81&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) is developed for real time quantifying GSH in living cells. Furthermore, the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) probe succeeded in sensitively tracking the dynamics of GSH in the real organisms bearing tumors, chronic renal failure, and liver fibrosis for unveiling the related pathological processes. We believe that the advance in chemistry with quantitative analysis methods will initiate more promising progress and broad applications.

         <title>Water&#8208;Driven Synthesis of Deep&#8208;Blue Perovskite Colloidal Quantum Wells for Electroluminescent Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A creatively water&#8208;driven strategy is devised to obtain size&#8208;homogenized and strongly confined deep&#8208;blue perovskite quantum wells (QWs) with remarkable stability and high photoluminescence quantum yield of 94&#8201;%. The electroluminescent devices based on the QWs show high luminance of 2946&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, demonstrating state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art brightness for perovskite QWs based devices.







Abstract
Perovskite colloidal quantum wells (QWs) are promising to realize narrow deep&#8208;blue emission, but the poor optical performance and stability suppress their practical application. Here, we creatively propose a water&#8208;driven synthesis strategy to obtain size&#8208;homogenized and strongly confined deep&#8208;blue CsPbBr3 QWs, corresponding to three monolayers, which emit at the deep&#8208;blue wavelength of 456&#8197;nm. The water controls the orientation and distribution of the ligands on the surface of the nanocrystals, thus inducing orientated growth through the Ostwald ripening process by phagocytizing unstable nanocrystals to form well&#8208;crystallized QWs. These QWs present remarkable stability and high photoluminescence quantum yield of 94&#8201;%. Furthermore, we have prepared light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the QWs via the all&#8208;solution fabrication strategy, achieving an external quantum efficiency of 1&#8201;% and luminance of 2946&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, demonstrating state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art brightness for perovskite QW&#8208;based LEDs.

         <title>Deciphering Siloxane Bond Exchanges: From a Molecular Study to Vitrimerization and Recycling of Silicone Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic exchanges in polymer networks are only desirable during reprocessing or recycling. We exploit thermal degradation of active exchangeable species to stop dynamic exchanges in siloxane networks and yield permanent networks. A rheological model for stress relaxation accounts for deactivation of exchanges and extracts the key kinetics parameters from simple experiments to predict the evolution of processability of the material.







Abstract
The activity of various additives promoting siloxane equilibration reactions is examined and quantified on model compounds. We found in particular that the &#8220;superbase&#8221; phosphazene derivative P4&#8208;tBu can promote very fast exchanges (a few seconds at 90&#8201;&#176;C) even at low concentration (&lt;0.1&#8197;wt&#8201;%). We demonstrate that permanent silicone networks can be transformed into reprocessable and recyclable dynamic networks by mere introduction of such additives. Annealing at high temperature degrades the additives and deactivates the dynamic features of the silicone networks, reverting them back into permanent networks. A simple rheological experiment and the corresponding model allow to extract the critical kinetic parameters to predict and control such deactivations.

         <title>Alkynyl&#8208;Protected Chiral Bimetallic Ag22Cu7 Superatom with Multiple Chirality Origins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alkynyl&#8208;protected chiral bimetallic AgCu superatomic nanocluster [Ag22Cu7(C&#8801;CR)16(PPh3)5Cl6]&#8722; with a high free valence electron count is reported. This cluster exhibits multiple chirality origins, including the metal core, metal&#8208;ligand interface and ligand layer.







Abstract
Understanding the origin of chirality in the nanostructured materials is essential for chiroptical and catalytic applications. Here we report a chiral AgCu superatomic cluster, [Ag22Cu7(C&#8801;CR)16(PPh3)5Cl6](PPh4), Ag22Cu7, protected by an achiral alkynyl ligand (HC&#8801;CR: 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylacetylene). Its crystal structure comprises a rare interpenetrating biicosahedral Ag17Cu2 core, which is stabilized by four different types of motifs: one Cu(C&#8801;CR)2, four &#8722;C&#8801;CR, two chlorides and one helical Ag5Cu4(C&#8801;CR)10(PPh3)5Cl4. Structural analysis reveals that Ag22Cu7 exhibits multiple chirality origins, including the metal core, the metal&#8208;ligand interface and the ligand layer. Furthermore, the circular dichroism spectra of R/S&#8208;Ag22Cu7 are obtained by employing appropriate chiral molecules as optical enrichment agents. DFT calculations show that Ag22Cu7 is an eight&#8208;electron superatom, confirm that the cluster is chirally active, and help to analyze the origins of the circular dichroism.

         <title>Synthesis, Biochemical Characterization, and Genetic Encoding of a 1,2,4&#8208;Triazole Amino Acid as an Acetyllysine Mimic for Bromodomains of the BET Family</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triazole&#8208;containing amino acid (ApmTri) was established as a mimic of acetyllysine for bromodomains of the BET family. Biochemical and structural investigations showed that ApmTri binds with similar affinity to bromodomains as acetyllysine and reflects the binding mode of the native modification at the atomic level. Genetic encoding enables ApmTri incorporation into proteins allowing investigations of bromodomain binding properties and inhibition.







Abstract
Lysine acetylation is a charge&#8208;neutralizing post&#8208;translational modification of proteins bound by bromodomains (Brds). A 1,2,4&#8208;triazole amino acid (ApmTri) was established as acetyllysine (Kac) mimic recruiting Brds of the BET family in contrast to glutamine commonly used for simulating this modification. Optimization of triazole substituents and side chain spacing allowed BET Brd recruitment to ApmTri&#8208;containing peptides with affinities similar to native substrates. Crystal structures of ApmTri&#8208;containing peptides in complex with two BET Brds revealed the binding mode which mirrored that of Kac ligands. ApmTri was genetically encoded and recombinant ApmTri&#8208;containing proteins co&#8208;enriched BRD3(2) from cellular lysates. This interaction was blocked by BET inhibitor JQ1. With genetically encoded ApmTri, biochemistry is now provided with a stable Kac mimic reflecting charge neutralization and Brd recruitment, allowing new investigations into BET proteins in vitro and in vivo.

         <title>Semiconductor SERS on Colourful Substrates with Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot Cavities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colourful SERS substrates can be achieved by involving Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot cavities with semiconductor materials. These are capable of enhancing the sensitivity by manipulating light into resonant absorption.







Abstract
Non&#8208;metallic materials have emerged as a new family of active substrates for surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), with unique advantages over their metal counterparts. However, owing to their inefficient interaction with the incident wavelength, the Raman enhancement achieved with non&#8208;metallic materials is considerably lower with respect to the metallic ones. Herein, we propose colourful semiconductor&#8208;based SERS substrates for the first time by utilizing a Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot cavity, which realize a large freedom in manipulating light. Owing to the delicate adjustment of the absorption in terms of both frequency and intensity, resonant absorption can be achieved with a variety of non&#8208;metal SERS substrates, with the sensitivity further enhanced by &#8776;100&#8197;times. As a typical example, by introducing a Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot&#8208;type substrate fabricated with SiO2/Si, a rather low detection limit of 10&#8722;16&#8197;M for the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2S protein is achieved on SnS2. This study provides a realistic strategy for increasing SERS sensitivity when semiconductors are employed as SERS substrates.

     alt="Semiconductor SERS on Colourful Substrates with Fabry-P&#233;rot Cavities"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colourful SERS substrates can be achieved by involving Fabry-P&#233;rot cavities with semiconductor materials. These are capable of enhancing the sensitivity by manipulating light into resonant absorption.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-metallic materials have emerged as a new family of active substrates for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), with unique advantages over their metal counterparts. However, owing to their inefficient interaction with the incident wavelength, the Raman enhancement achieved with non-metallic materials is considerably lower with respect to the metallic ones. Herein, we propose colourful semiconductor-based SERS substrates for the first time by utilizing a Fabry-P&#233;rot cavity, which realize a large freedom in manipulating light. Owing to the delicate adjustment of the absorption in terms of both frequency and intensity, resonant absorption can be achieved with a variety of non-metal SERS substrates, with the sensitivity further enhanced by &#8776;100&#8197;times. As a typical example, by introducing a Fabry-P&#233;rot-type substrate fabricated with SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Si, a rather low detection limit of 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;16&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M for the SARS-CoV-2S protein is achieved on SnS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This study provides a realistic strategy for increasing SERS sensitivity when semiconductors are employed as SERS substrates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of Multi&#8208;Metal Electrocatalyst Powders and Electrodes and their Application for Oxygen Evolution and Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer/metal precursor spraying synthesis technique was developed as a straightforward and scalable method to produce multi&#8208;metal catalyst powders and Ni&#8208;foam based electrodes. 11 different multi&#8208;metal catalyst powders were characterized and investigated towards the oxygen evolution reaction. CoNiFeMoCr&#8208;modified Ni&#8208;foam electrodes were investigated for water splitting in MEA&#8208;type model electrolyzers up to current densities of 3&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;metal electrocatalysts provide nearly unlimited catalytic possibilities arising from synergistic element interactions. We propose a polymer/metal precursor spraying technique that can easily be adapted to produce a large variety of compositional different multi&#8208;metal catalyst materials. To demonstrate this, 11 catalysts were synthesized, characterized, and investigated for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Further investigation of the most active OER catalyst, namely CoNiFeMoCr, revealed a polycrystalline structure, and operando Raman measurements indicate that multiple active sites are participating in the reaction. Moreover, Ni foam&#8208;supported CoNiFeMoCr electrodes were developed and applied for water splitting in flow&#8208;through electrolysis cells with electrolyte gaps and in zero&#8208;gap membrane electrode assembly (MEA) configurations. The proposed alkaline MEA&#8208;type electrolyzers reached up to 3&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and 24&#8197;h measurements demonstrated no loss of current density of 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Amplification of Lipid Peroxidation by Regulating Cell Membrane Unsaturation To Enhance Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;reinforcing chemodynamic therapy (CDT) agent was prepared by loading oleanolic acid (OA) into hollow carbon&#8208;supported iron single&#8208;atom catalysts (Fe&#8208;SAC) prior to coating with erythrocyte membrane (EM). Fe&#8208;SAC&#8208;catalyzed &#8901;OH generation from H2O2, in addition to initiating CDT, triggers EM destruction to release OA, which can amplify lipid peroxidation by enriching cell membranes with polyunsaturated fatty acids, enabling enhanced CDT efficacy.







Abstract
Lipid peroxidation (LPO) is one of the most damaging processes in chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Although it is well known that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are much more susceptible than saturated or monounsaturated ones to LPO, there is no study exploring the effect of cell membrane unsaturation degree on CDT. Here, we report a self&#8208;reinforcing CDT agent (denoted as OA@Fe&#8208;SAC@EM NPs), consisting of oleanolic acid (OA)&#8208;loaded iron single&#8208;atom catalyst (Fe&#8208;SAC)&#8208;embedded hollow carbon nanospheres encapsulated by an erythrocyte membrane (EM), which promotes LPO to improve chemodynamic efficacy via modulating the degree of membrane unsaturation. Upon uptake of OA@Fe&#8208;SAC@EM NPs by cancer cells, Fe&#8208;SAC&#8208;catalyzed conversion of endogenous hydrogen peroxide into hydroxyl radicals, in addition to initiating the chemodynamic therapeutic process, causes the dissociation of the EM shell and the ensuing release of OA that can enrich cellular membranes with PUFAs, enabling LPO amplification&#8208;enhanced CDT.

A regio&#8208; and stereoselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component syn&#8208;1,2&#8208;arylmethylation of internal alkynes is reported. A library of methyl containing tetra&#8208;substituted olefins was successfully built using readily available and bench&#8208;stable coupling partners, iodo&#8208;arenes, and methyl boronic acid.







Abstract
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component syn&#8208;1,2&#8208;arylmethylation of internal alkynes (ynamides/yne&#8208;acetates/alkynes) is described. The readily available and bench stable coupling partners iodo&#8208;arenes, and methyl boronic acid are successfully used in this coupling strategy to access the methyl&#8208;containing tetra&#8208;substituted olefins; the scope is broad showing excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance. Notably, the transformation is regio&#8208; as well as stereoselective. The biologically relevant motifs (BRM) bearing iodo&#8208;arenes and ynamides are also used for the late&#8208;stage syn&#8208;1,2&#8208;arylmethylation of alkynes. Aryl&#8208;alkylation, aryl&#8208;trideuteriomethylation, alkynyl&#8208;methylation, and alkenyl&#8208;methylation of ynamides are also presented. The Me&#8208;substituted alkenes are further transformed into synthetically important &#946;&#8208;amino&#8208;indenones and &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#945;&#8242;&#8208;methyl ketones.

         <title>Prebiotic Synthesis and Isomerization in Interstellar Analog Ice: Glycinal, Acetamide, and Their Enol Tautomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Out of the cold: Ammonia (NH3) and acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) are exposed to galactic cosmic ray proxies while frozen at 5&#8197;K to simulate the environment of an interstellar molecular cloud. Reactants undergo dissociation and radical recombination to produce glycinal (NH2CH2CHO) and acetamide (CH3CONH2) prior to tautomerization to 2&#8208;aminoethenol (HOCHCHNH2) and 1&#8208;aminoethenol (H2CC(OH)NH2), respectively.







Abstract
Glycinal (HCOCH2NH2) and acetamide (CH3CONH2) are simple molecular building blocks of biomolecules in prebiotic chemistry, though their origin on early Earth and formation in interstellar media remain a mystery. These molecules are formed with their tautomers in low temperature interstellar model ices upon interaction with simulated galactic cosmic rays. Glycinal and acetamide are accessed via barrierless radical&#8208;radical reactions of vinoxy (&#8901;CH2CHO) and acetyl (&#8901;C(O)CH3), and then undergo keto&#8208;enol tautomerization. Exploiting tunable photoionization reflectron time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectroscopy and photoionization efficiency (PIE) curves, these results demonstrate fundamental reaction pathways for the formation of complex organics through non&#8208;equilibrium ice reactions in cold molecular cloud environments. These molecules demonstrate an unconventional starting point for abiotic synthesis of organics relevant to contemporary biomolecules like polypeptides and cell membranes in deep space.

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Cationic Disordering Induces two Distinct Degradation Pathways in Co&#8208;Free Ni&#8208;Rich Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Ni&#8208;rich Li1&#8722;m(Ni0.94Al0.06)1+mO2 (NA) oxides are synthesized through tailoring the heating temperature. The NA oxides with high cation disorder experience a comparably homogeneous fatigue process upon extended cycling, while a disordered surface with lattice mismatch is gradually formed in the NA with low cation disorder (i.e. heterogeneous degradation) which results in a rapid capacity decay during the fast charge&#8211;discharge cycling.







Abstract
Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are one of the most attractive cathode materials in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries, their degradation mechanisms are still not completely elucidated. Herein, we report a strong dependence of degradation pathways on the long&#8208;range cationic disordering of Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich Li1&#8722;m(Ni0.94Al0.06)1+mO2 (NA). Interestingly, a disordered layered phase with lattice mismatch can be easily formed in the near&#8208;surface region of NA particles with very low cation disorder (NA&#8208;LCD, m&#8804;0.06) over electrochemical cycling, while the layered structure is basically maintained in the core of particles forming a &#8220;core&#8211;shell&#8221; structure. Such surface reconstruction triggers a rapid capacity decay during the first 100&#8197;cycles between 2.7 and 4.3&#8197;V at 1&#8197;C or 3&#8197;C. On the contrary, the local lattice distortions are gradually accumulated throughout the whole NA particles with higher degrees of cation disorder (NA&#8208;HCD, 0.06&#8804;m&#8804;0.15) that lead to a slow capacity decay upon cycling.

         <title>Organic Additive&#8208;derived Films on Cu Electrodes Promote Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to C2+ Products Under Strongly Acidic Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modified copper electrodes with N&#8208;tolyl pyridinium additive&#8208;derived films show boosted selectivity of the CO2 reduction to C2+ products (&gt;70&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency) and great suppression of the hydrogen evolution reaction in strongly acidic electrolytes with low alkali cation concentrations.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) at low pH is desired for high CO2 utilization; the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) remains a challenge. High alkali cation concentration at a high operating current density has recently been used to promote electrochemical CO2R at low pH. Herein we report an alternative approach to selective CO2R (&gt;70&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency for C2+ products, FEC2+) at low pH (pH&#8197;2; H3PO4/KH2PO4) and low potassium concentration ([K+]=0.1&#8197;M) using organic film&#8208;modified polycrystalline copper (Modified&#8208;Cu). Such an electrode effectively mitigates HER due to attenuated proton transport. Modified&#8208;Cu still achieves high FEC2+ (45&#8201;% with Cu foil /55&#8201;% with Cu GDE) under 1.0&#8197;M H3PO4 (pH&#8776;1) at low [K+] (0.1&#8197;M), even at low operating current, conditions where HER can otherwise dominate.

         <title>A New Thiolate&#8208;Bound Dimanganese Cluster as a Structural and Functional Model for Class Ib Ribonucleotide Reductases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the aim to mimic the reactivity of class&#8197;Ib ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs), a new thiolate&#8208;bound MnII2 compound was studied. Upon superoxide activation it forms a reactive intermediate that exhibits a 16&#8208;line St=1/2 EPR signal at g=2 and oxidizes substituted phenols, thereby resembling the enzymatic behavior and, thus, providing new mechanistic insight into class&#8197;Ib RNR reactivity.







Abstract
In class&#8197;Ib ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) a dimanganese(II) cluster activates superoxide (O2&#8901;&#8722;) rather than dioxygen (O2), to access a high valent MnIII&#8722;O2&#8722;MnIV species, responsible for the oxidation of tyrosine to tyrosyl radical. In a biomimetic approach, we report the synthesis of a thiolate&#8208;bound dimanganese complex [MnII2(BPMT)(OAc)2](ClO)4 (BPMT=(2,6&#8208;bis{[bis(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amino]methyl}&#8208;4&#8208;methylthiophenolate) (1) and its reaction with O2&#8901;&#8722; to form a [(BPMT)MnO2Mn]2+ complex 2. Resonance Raman investigation revealed the presence of an O&#8722;O bond in 2, while EPR analysis displayed a 16&#8208;line St=1/2 signal at g=2 typically associated with a MnIIIMnIV core, as detected in class&#8197;Ib RNRs. Unlike all other previously reported Mn&#8722;O2&#8722;Mn complexes, generated by O2&#8901;&#8722; activation at Mn2 centers, 2 proved to be a capable electrophilic oxidant in aldehyde deformylation and phenol oxidation reactions, rendering it one of the best structural and functional models for class&#8197;Ib RNRs.

         <title>A Novel Aluminum&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Uniform Micropores for Trace BTEX Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Al&#8208;based MOF is described with uniform micropore size of 8.37&#177;0.73&#8197;&#197; and excellent chemical&#8208;thermal stability for trace BTEX, e.g., benzene adsorption of 3.80&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at relative pressure (P/P0)=0.01 and 298&#8197;K, which is the largest value reported.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are potential porous adsorbents for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX). A novel MOF, using low toxic aluminum (Al) as the metal, named as ZJU&#8208;620(Al), with uniform micropore size of 8.37&#177;0.73&#8197;&#197; and specific surface area of 1347&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, was synthesized. It is constructed by one&#8208;dimensional rod&#8208;shaped AlO6 clusters, formate ligands and 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triyl) tribenzoic ligands. ZJU&#8208;620(Al) exhibits excellent chemical&#8208;thermal stability and adsorption for trace BTEX, e.g., benzene adsorption of 3.80&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at P/P0=0.01 and 298&#8197;K, which is the largest one reported. Using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations and Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses, it was observed that the excellent adsorption could be attributed to the high affinity of BTEX molecules in ZJU&#8208;620(Al) micropores because the kinetic diameters of BTEX are close up to the pore size of ZJU&#8208;620(Al).

&lt;p&gt;Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are potential porous adsorbents for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX). A novel MOF, using low toxic aluminum (Al) as the metal, named as ZJU-620(Al), with uniform micropore size of 8.37&#177;0.73&#8197;&#197; and specific surface area of 1347&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, was synthesized. It is constructed by one-dimensional rod-shaped AlO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; clusters, formate ligands and 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;-(2,4,6-trimethylbenzene-1,3,5-triyl) tribenzoic ligands. ZJU-620(Al) exhibits excellent chemical-thermal stability and adsorption for trace BTEX, &lt;i&gt;e.g&lt;/i&gt;., benzene adsorption of 3.80&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=0.01 and 298&#8197;K, which is the largest one reported. Using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations and Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses, it was observed that the excellent adsorption could be attributed to the high affinity of BTEX molecules in ZJU-620(Al) micropores because the kinetic diameters of BTEX are close up to the pore size of ZJU-620(Al).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Elucidating Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction Kinetics via Intermediates by Time&#8208;Dependent Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beyond electron transfer number and rate constant for oxygen reduction reaction, the potential&#8208;dependent time and spatial distribution of reactive oxygen species in the diffusion layer was successfully revealed from time&#8208;dependent electrochemiluminescence decay curves. Such uncovered information would guide electrocatalysts for fuel cells and H2O2 production with maximized activity and durability.







Abstract
Facile evaluation of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics for electrocatalysts is critical for sustainable fuel&#8208;cell development and industrial H2O2 production. Despite great success in ORR studies using mainstream strategies, such as the membrane electrode assembly, rotation electrodes, and advanced surface&#8208;sensitive spectroscopy, the time and spatial distribution of reactive oxygen species (ROS) intermediates in the diffusion layer remain unknown. Using time&#8208;dependent electrochemiluminescence (Td&#8208;ECL), we report an intermediate&#8208;oriented method for ORR kinetics analysis. Owing to multiple ultrasensitive stoichiometric reactions between ROS and the ECL emitter, except for electron transfer numbers and rate constants, the potential&#8208;dependent time and spatial distribution of ROS were successfully obtained for the first time. Such exclusively uncovered information would guide the development of electrocatalysts for fuel cells and H2O2 production with maximized activity and durability.

         <title>In situ Observation of Porosity Formation in Porous Single&#8208;crystalline TiO2 Monolith for Enhanced and Stable Catalytic CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we demonstrate the comprehensive growth methodology of porous single crystals at the macroscale by using in situ transmission electron microscopy.







Abstract
Introducing pores in single crystals creates a new type of porous materials that incorporate porosity and structural coherence. Herein, we use in situ transmission electron microscopy to disclose the porosity formation by converting KTiOPO4 (KTP) single crystals into porous single&#8208;crystalline (PSC) TiO2 monoliths in a solid&#8208;solid transformation. The isolated crystalline nuclei of TiO2 clusters with identical lattice orientation on KTP surface moves TiO2/KTP interface toward mother phase for growing PSC TiO2 monoliths. The relative density in PSC TiO2 monoliths dominates porosity while the macroscopic dimensions remain unchanged in the transformation. The single&#8208;crystalline nature of porous architecture stabilizes oxygen vacancy to activate lattice oxygen while the three&#8208;dimensional percolation enhances species diffusion. PSC TiO2 monoliths with deposited Pt clusters show enhanced and stable catalytic CO oxidation in air at &#8764;75&#8201;&#176;C for 200&#8197;hours of operation.

         <title>Discovery of a Unique Flavonoid Biosynthesis Mechanism in Fungi by Genome Mining</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plant flavonoids are synthesized by type&#8197;III PKS followed by chalcone isomerase (CHI) and flavone synthase (FNS). Now a unique flavonoid biosynthesis mechanism has been identified in fungi by genome mining. The chalcone skeleton is assembled by an NRPS&#8208;PKS hybrid enzyme, and subsequent conversion into a flavone is catalyzed by new types of CHI and FNS. This finding provides new insight into the microbial production of valuable plant flavonoids.







Abstract
Flavonoids are important plant natural products with variable structures and bioactivities. All known plant flavonoids are generated under the catalysis of a type&#8197;III polyketide synthase (PKS) followed by a chalcone isomerase (CHI) and a flavone synthase (FNS). In this study, the biosynthetic gene cluster of chlorflavonin, a fungal flavonoid with acetolactate synthase inhibitory activity, was discovered using a self&#8208;resistance&#8208;gene&#8208;directed strategy. A novel flavonoid biosynthetic pathway in fungi was revealed. A core nonribosomal peptide synthetase&#8208;polyketide synthase (NRPS&#8208;PKS) is responsible for the generation of the key precursor chalcone. Then, a new type of CHI catalyzes the conversion of a chalcone into a flavanone by a histidine&#8208;mediated oxa&#8208;Michael addition mechanism. Finally, the desaturation of flavanone to flavone is catalyzed by a new type of FNS, a flavin mononucleotide (FMN)&#8208;dependent oxidoreductase.

         <title>Evolving Robust and Interpretable Enzymes for the Bioethanol Industry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymes are at the core of biotransformation in first&#8208; and second&#8208;generation bioethanol production processes. By integrating the transferable protein evolution strategy InSiReP 2.0 (In Silico guided Recombination Process), the model cellulase PvCel5A was evolved to overcome the remaining challenge of low ethanol tolerance and thermal stability, which hindered the further improvement of biomass transformation and bioethanol yield prior to this study.







Abstract
Obtaining a robust and applicable enzyme for bioethanol production is a dream for biorefinery engineers. Herein, we describe a general method to evolve an all&#8208;round and interpretable enzyme that can be directly employed in the bioethanol industry. By integrating the transferable protein evolution strategy InSiReP 2.0 (In Silico guided Recombination Process), enzymatic characterization for actual production, and computational molecular understanding, the model cellulase PvCel5A (endoglucanase II Cel5A from Penicillium verruculosum) was successfully evolved to overcome the remaining challenges of low ethanol and temperature tolerance, which primarily limited biomass transformation and bioethanol yield. Remarkably, application of the PvCel5A variants in both first&#8208; and second&#8208;generation bioethanol production processes (i. Conventional corn ethanol fermentation combined with the in situ pretreatment process; ii. cellulosic ethanol fermentation process) resulted in a 5.7&#8211;10.1&#8201;% increase in the ethanol yield, which was unlikely to be achieved by other optimization techniques.

         <title>Organic Photovoltaic Catalyst with &#963;&#8208;&#960; Anchor for High&#8208;Performance Solar Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic photovoltaic catalyst (Y6CO) with a central steric&#8208;hindrance&#8208;free carbonyl group, achieves efficient Pt0 in situ deposition through &#963;&#8208;&#960; anchoring, leading to significantly enhanced utilization of the Pt cocatalyst and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of Y6CO/Pt based nanoparticles under simulated solar light illumination.







Abstract
Efficient in situ deposition of metallic cocatalyst, like zero&#8208;valent platinum (Pt), on organic photovoltaic catalysts (OPCs) is the prerequisite for their high catalytic activities.

&lt;p&gt;An organic photovoltaic catalyst (Y6CO) with a central steric-hindrance-free carbonyl group, achieves efficient Pt&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; in situ deposition through &#963;-&#960; anchoring, leading to significantly enhanced utilization of the Pt cocatalyst and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of Y6CO/Pt based nanoparticles under simulated solar light illumination.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficient in situ deposition of metallic cocatalyst, like zero-valent platinum (Pt), on organic photovoltaic catalysts (OPCs) is the prerequisite for their high catalytic activities. Here we develop the OPC (Y6CO), by introducing carbonyl in the core, which is available to &#963;-&#960; coordinate with transition metals, due to the high-energy empty &#960;* orbital of carbonyl. Y6CO exhibits a stronger capability to anchor Pt species and reduce them to metallic state, resulting in more Pt&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; deposition, relative to the control OPC without the central &#963;-&#960; anchor. Single-component and heterojunction nanoparticles (NPs) employing Y6CO show enhanced average hydrogen evolution rates of 230.98 and 323.22&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;[OPC]&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, under AM 1.5G, 100&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for 10&#8197;h, and heterojunction NPs yield the external quantum efficiencies of ca. 10&#8201;% in 500&#8211;800&#8197;nm. This work demonstrates that &#963;-&#960; anchoring is one efficient strategy for integrating metallic cocatalyst and OPC for high-performance photocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solid&#8208;state Fluorescence from Carbon Dots Widely Tunable from Blue to Deep Red through Surface Ligand Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state fluorescent (SSF) carbon dots (CDs) with an emission&#8208;color span of almost 300&#8197;nm (from blue to deep red) were obtained through surface ligand modulation. The emission wavelengths can be switched smoothly by deliberately altering the conjugation ability between substituent ligands and carbon core. The developed SSF CDs showed great potential for widespread use in three&#8208;dimensional printing and various types of optical displays.







Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) find widespread attention due to their remarkable fluorescent and electronic properties. However, aggregation&#8208;caused quenching currently limits the application of CDs in colored displays. The construction of CDs with color&#8208;tunable solid&#8208;state fluorescence (SSF) is rarely reported, since the preparation of SSF CDs is technically challenging. Herein, through surface ligand modulation, SSF CDs with an emission&#8208;color span of almost 300&#8197;nm (from blue to deep red) were obtained. In&#8208;depth structure&#8208;property studies reveal that intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding inside SSF CDs provokes the emission properties in the aggregated state. Photodynamic characterizations demonstrate emission wavelengths can be switched smoothly by deliberately altering conjugation ability between substituent ligands and CDs core. Three&#8208;dimensional printing patterning is used to create a range of emissive objects, demonstrating the commercial potential for use in optical lamps.

         <title>A Two&#8208;Dimensional Porphyrin Coordination Supramolecular Network Cathode for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Dual&#8208;Ion Battery</title>

         <dc:description>
Via charge&#8208;transfer interaction between porphyrin nitrogen and I3&#8722;, Zn&#8208;TCPP achieves an effective anchoring of I3&#8722;. Besides, the open channels constructed by 2D layered network are beneficial to the penetration of I3&#8722; and the accessibility of the porphyrin nitrogen active sites, which brings an excellent electrochemical performance to the Zn&#8208;TCPP cathode.







Abstract
Iodine has great potential in the energy storage, but high solubility of I3&#8722; has seriously delayed its promotion. Benefited from abundant active sites and the open channel, two&#8208;dimensional coordination supramolecular networks (2D CSNs) is considered to be a candidate for the energy storage. Herein, a 2D porphyrin&#8208;CSN cathode named Zn&#8208;TCPP for aqueous iodine dual&#8208;ion battery (DIB) shows an excellent specific capacity of 278&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, and a high energy density of 340&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, as well as a durable cycle performance of 5000 cycles and a high Coulombic efficiency of 98&#8201;%. Molecular orbital theory, UV/VIS, Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal charge&#8208;transfer interaction between the donor of porphyrin nitrogen and the acceptor of I3&#8722;, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations demonstrate the contribution of 2D layered network structure of Zn&#8208;TCPP to the penetration of I3&#8722;.

         <title>Evaluation and Improvement of the Stability of Poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;based Solid&#8208;state Batteries with High&#8208;Voltage Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The failure of cells in poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)&#8208;based solid&#8208;state lithium batteries at high voltages, indicated by &#8220;voltage noise&#8221; and attributed to the formation of lithium dendrites, was effectively overcome by using higher molecular weight PEO. In addition, the PEO/NCM interface was investigated by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirming oxidative degradation of PEO.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) with high&#8208;voltage cathode active materials (CAMs) such as LiNi1&#8722;x&#8722;yCoxMnyO2 (NCM) and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) suffer from &#8220;noisy voltage&#8221; related cell failure. Moreover, reports on their long&#8208;term cycling performance with high&#8208;voltage CAMs are not consistent. In this work, we verified that the penetration of lithium dendrites through the solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) indeed causes such &#8220;noisy voltage cell failure&#8221;. This problem can be overcome by a simple modification of the SPE using higher molecular weight PEO, resulting in an improved cycling stability compared to lower molecular weight PEO. Furthermore, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis confirms the formation of oxidative degradation products after cycling with NCM, for what Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy is not suitable as an analytical technique due to its limited surface sensitivity. Overall, our results help to critically evaluate and improve the stability of PEO&#8208;based SSBs.

         <title>Functional Roles of Polymers in Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescent Materials: Modulation of Intersystem Crossing, Air Sensitivity and Biological Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional roles of polymers, other than &#8220;inert&#8221; protecting media, were introduced and highlighted in room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials. Three exemplary roles include modulations of intersystem crossing, air sensitivity and biological activity, respectively, which greatly expand the application horizons for sophisticated polymeric RTP materials in the future.







Abstract
Organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials routinely incorporate polymeric components, which usually act as non&#8208;functional or &#8220;inert&#8221; media to protect excited&#8208;state phosphors from thermal and collisional quenching, but are lesser explored for other influences. Here, we report some exemplary &#8220;active roles&#8221; of polymer matrices played in organic RTP materials, including: 1)&#8197;color modulation of total delayed emissions via balancing the population ratio between thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and RTP due to dielectric&#8208;dependent intersystem crossing; 2)&#8197;altered air sensitivity of RTP materials by generating various surface morphologies such as nano&#8208;sized granules; 3)&#8197;enhanced bacterial elimination for enhanced electrostatic interactions with negatively charged bio&#8208;membranes. These active roles demonstrated that the vast library of polymeric structures and functionalities can be married to organic phosphors to broaden new application horizons for RTP materials.

Here, we report some exemplary &#8220;active roles&#8221; of polymer matrices played in organic RTP materials, including: 1)&#8197;color modulation of total delayed emissions via balancing the population ratio between thermally-activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and RTP due to dielectric-dependent intersystem crossing; 2)&#8197;altered air sensitivity of RTP materials by generating various surface morphologies such as nano-sized granules; 3)&#8197;enhanced bacterial elimination for enhanced electrostatic interactions with negatively charged bio-membranes. These active roles demonstrated that the vast library of polymeric structures and functionalities can be married to organic phosphors to broaden new application horizons for RTP materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Isoindolium&#8208;Based Allenes: Reactivity Studies and Applications in Fluorescence Temperature Sensing and Cysteine Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of a series of electron&#8208;deficient isoindolium&#8208;based allenes 1 with sulfhydryl compounds has been studied. The vinyl sulfides 2 generated were converted into indanones 3 and amines 4 in good yields upon heating at 30&#8211;70&#8201;&#176;C. Applications of the vinyl sulfides 2 include the design and synthesis of a novel FRET&#8208;based fluorescent temperature sensor and chemoselective cysteine bioconjugation to provide multifunctional peptide bioconjugates.







Abstract
The reaction of a series of electron&#8208;deficient isoindolium&#8208;based allenes with sulfhydryl compounds has been studied, leading to the formation of isoindolium&#8208;based vinyl sulfides. The vinyl sulfides generated could be readily converted into the corresponding indanones and amines upon heating at 30&#8211;70&#8201;&#176;C with good yields up to 61&#8201;%. The thermal cleavage reaction of vinyl sulfides was further studied for developing temperature&#8208;sensitive systems. Notably, a novel FRET&#8208;based fluorescent temperature sensor was designed and synthesized for temperature sensing at 50&#8201;&#176;C, giving a 6.5&#8208;fold blue fluorescence enhancement. Moreover, chemoselective bioconjugation of cysteine&#8208;containing peptides with the isoindolium&#8208;based allenes for the construction of multifunctional peptide bioconjugates was investigated. Thermal cleavage of isoindoliums on the modified peptides at 35&#8211;70&#8201;&#176;C gave indanone bioconjugates with up to &gt;99&#8201;% conversion. These results indicated the biocompatibility of this novel temperature&#8208;sensitive reaction.

         <title>Origin and Regulation of Interface Fusion during Synthesis of Single&#8208;Crystal Ni&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interface atom migration plays a key role in the formation of Ni&#8208;based layered oxide single&#8208;crystals, which is mainly controlled by the intermediate lithiation state. Strengthening the lithiation kinetics is helpful to promote the formation of intermediate states and further accelerate the formation of the single&#8208;crystal morphology.







Abstract
Interface fusion plays a key role in constructing Ni&#8208;based single&#8208;crystal cathodes, and is governed by the atomic migration related to kinetics. However, the interfacial atom migration path and its control factors are lack of clearly understanding. Herein, we systematically probe the solid&#8208;state synthesis mechanism of single&#8208;crystal LiNi0.92Co0.04Mn0.04O2, including the effects of precursor size, Li/transition metal (TM) ratio and sintering temperature on the structure. Multi&#8208;dimensional analysis unravels that thermodynamics drives interface atoms migration through intermediate state (i.e., cation mixing phase) to induce grain boundary fusion. Moreover, we demonstrate that smaller precursor size (&lt;6&#8197;&#956;m), lager Li/TM ratio (&gt;1.0) and higher temperature (&#8805;810&#8201;&#176;C) are conducive to promote the growth of the intermediate state due to reaction kinetics enhancement, and ultimately strengthen the atomic migration&#8208;induced interface fusion.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Tuned Multicolor Emission of 2D Lead Halide Perovskites with Ultrahigh Color Purity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wide&#8208;range and ultrapure emissions are achieved in 2D lead halide perovskites (LHPs) by combined chemical pressure from halogen doping/substitution and physical pressure from hydrostatic compression. This work demonstrates precise emission tuning and effective color regulation of 2D LHPs by pressure engineering, which would open a new pathway for developing ultrapure emitters and highly sensitive pressure sensors.







Abstract
The chemical diversity and structural flexibility of lead halide perovskites (LHPs) offer tremendous opportunities to tune their optical properties through internal molecular engineering and external stimuli. Herein, we report the wide&#8208;range and ultrapure photoluminescence emissions in a family of homologous 2D LHPs, [MeOPEA]2PbBr4&#8722;4xI4x (MeOPEA=4&#8208;methoxyphenethylammonium; x=0, 0.2, 0.425, 0.575, 1) enabled through internal chemical pressure and external hydrostatic pressure. The chemical pressure, induced by the C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions and halogen doping/substitution strengthens the structural rigidity to give sustained narrow emissions, and regulates the emission energy, respectively. Further manipulation of physical pressure leads to wide&#8208;range emission tuning from 412 to 647&#8197;nm in a continuous and reversible manner. This work could open up new pathways for developing 2D LHP emitters with ultra&#8208;wide color gamut and high color purity which are highly useful for pressure sensing.

         <title>Revealing the Origin of Transition&#8208;Metal Migration in Layered Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathodes: Random Na Extraction and Na&#8208;Free Layer Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The origin of cation migration in layered sodium&#8208;ion battery cathode is first elucidated, which is attributed to the Na&#8208;free layer forming under high charge potential due to the random desodiation reaction. A 3d/4d metal co&#8208;doping strategy is developed to address the unfavourable cation migration by creating a selective desodiation reaction.







Abstract
Cation migration often occurs in layered oxide cathodes of lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to the similar ion radius of Li and transition metals (TMs). Although Na and TM show a big difference of ion radius, TMs in layered cathodes of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) can still migrate to Na layer, leading to serious electrochemical degeneration. To elucidate the origin of TM migration in layered SIB cathodes, we choose NaCrO2, a typical layered cathode suffering from serious TM migration, as a model material and find that the TM migration is derived from the random desodiation and subsequent formation of Na&#8208;free layer at high charge potential. A Ru/Ti co&#8208;doping strategy is developed to address the issue, where the doped active Ru is first oxidized to create a selective desodiation and the doped inactive Ti can function as a pillar to avoid complete desodiation in Ru&#8208;contained TM layers, leading to the suppression of the Na&#8208;free layer formation and subsequent enhanced electrochemical performance.

         <title>Scalable Green Synthesis of Robust Ultra&#8208;Microporous Hofmann Clathrate Material with Record C3H6 Storage Density for Efficient C3H6/C3H8 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy that incorporates high&#8208;density strong binding sites into ultra&#8208;microporous Hofmann clathrate material for dense packing of C3H6 molecules is reported. The use of this new porous material not only overcomes the trade&#8208;off between uptake capacity and selectivity but also combines excellent separation performance with high stability, economic feasibility and easy scalability of synthesis.







Abstract
Developing porous materials for C3H6/C3H8 separation faces the challenge of merging excellent separation performance with high stability and easy scalability of synthesis. Herein, we report a robust Hofmann clathrate material (ZJU&#8208;75a), featuring high&#8208;density strong binding sites to achieve all the above requirements. ZJU&#8208;75a adsorbs large amount of C3H6 with a record high storage density of 0.818&#8197;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1, and concurrently shows high C3H6/C3H8 selectivity (54.2) at 296&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar. Single&#8208;crystal structure analysis unveil that the high&#8208;density binding sites in ZJU&#8208;75a not only provide much stronger interactions with C3H6 but also enable the dense packing of C3H6. Breakthrough experiments on gas mixtures afford both high separation factor of 14.7 and large C3H6 uptake (2.79&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1). This material is highly stable and can be easily produced at kilogram&#8208;scale using a green synthesis method, making it as a benchmark material to address major challenges for industrial C3H6/C3H8 separation.

         <title>Photothermally Triggered Copper Payload Release for Cuproptosis&#8208;Promoted Cancer Synergistic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold&#8208;nanorod&#8208;based, copper&#8208;doped, and disulfiram (DSF)&#8208;loaded multifunctional therapeutic nanoplatform (Au@MSN&#8208;Cu/PEG/DSF) was fabricated to deliver DSF and Cu2+ into cancer cells efficiently. A photothermal effect triggered on&#8208;command payload release remotely to form cytotoxic bis(diethyldithiocarbamate)copper (CuET) and Cu+ in situ. This cuproptosis&#8208;based strategy offers synergistic therapeutic modalities.







Abstract
Cuproptosis is a new form of programmed cell death and exhibits enormous potential in cancer treatment. However, reducing the undesirable Cu ion release in normal tissue and maximizing the copper&#8208;induced therapeutic effect in cancer sites are two main challenges. In this study, we constructed a photothermally triggered nanoplatform (Au@MSN&#8208;Cu/PEG/DSF) to realize on&#8208;demand delivery for synergistic therapy. The released disulfiram (DSF) chelated with Cu2+ in situ to generate highly cytotoxic bis(diethyldithiocarbamate)copper (CuET), causing cell apoptosis, and the formed Cu+ species promoted toxic mitochondrial protein aggregation, leading to cell cuproptosis. Synergistic with photothermal therapy, Au@MSN&#8208;Cu/PEG/DSF could effectively kill tumor cells and inhibit tumor growth (inhibition rate up to 80.1&#8201;%). These results provide a promising perspective for potential cancer treatment based on cuproptosis, and may also inspire the design of advanced nano&#8208;therapeutic platforms.

         <title>Cover Picture: Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly as a Tool To Preserve the Electronic Purity of Perylene Diimide Chromophores (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 12/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular chromophore cube based on perylene diimides (PDIs) is reported by Sascha Feldmann and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202216729). The rigid and shape&#8208;persistent cage preserves the electronic purity of its PDI constituents and enables the observation of delayed fluorescence because of its bright excited multimer state, acting as an excitation reservoir. Self&#8208;assembly can thus serve as a powerful tool for controlling electronic properties in molecular electronics devices.

Porous and water&#8208;stable hybrid semiconductors as multifunctional materials display traits that are essential for demanding commercial applications. In their Research Article (e202218429), Ioannis Spanopoulos and co&#8208;workers report a strategy for generating porosity in hybrid metal halide semiconductors by using molecular cages as both structure&#8208;directing agents and counter&#8208;cations. This strategy gave rise to a direct bandgap semiconductor with record water stability and selective vapor sorption.

         <title>A New PETase from the Human Saliva Metagenome and Its Functional Modification via Genetic Code Expansion in Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uttamapinant et&#8197;al. reported the discovery of new polyethylene terephthalate (PET) degrading enzymes from aquatic and human saliva metagenomes. Their catalytic performance is up to 83 times higher than known PETases. Site&#8208;specific incorporation of an unnatural amino acid results in a stable acyl&#8208;enzyme intermediate and a PET&#8208;enzyme conjugate which can be imaged via confocal microscopy.







Abstract
The discovery and engineering of new plastic degrading enzymes is an important challenge in chemical biotechnology to enable transition to a more sustainable and circular plastics economy. This field has so far yielded a range of enzymes and microbial pathways for the recycling and valorization of plastic waste. New research from Uttamapinant et&#8197;al. reports the discovery of a novel polyethylene terephthalate (PET) hydrolase from the human saliva metagenome that displays improved properties and catalytic performance over previously characterized PET hydrolases (PETases). The authors also demonstrate the site&#8208;specific incorporation of a photocaged unnatural amino acid, 2,3&#8208;diaminopropionic acid (DAP), which upon photodecaging enables covalent binding of DAP to the PET surface. Thus, this work highlights metagenomic datasets as an untapped source of new PET degrading enzymes and the chemical modification of PETases via genetic code expansion, enabling new biotechnologies for the circular plastics economy.

         <title>Gold Extracted from Wastewater as an Efficient MOF&#8208;Supported Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent work by Zhao and co&#8208;workers takes advantage of the versatility of metal organic frameworks (MOFs), to selectively recover gold from wastewater. More interestingly, the studied MOF serves as a stable platform to transform adsorbed gold into an efficient catalyst for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 into CO, reaching currents of more than 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The recovery of gold from wastewater is necessary from both environmental and economic standpoints. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can serve as high&#8208;capacity and selective adsorbents, as shown in a recent work by Zhao and co&#8208;workers. Their novel three&#8208;dimension cationic framework goes further than selectively adsorbing AuCl4&#8722;. It also serves as a stable platform to transform adsorbed gold into an efficient catalyst for the electrochemical reduction of CO2. This work highlights the versatility of MOFs, which can serve as selective adsorbents and as a support for nanoparticle catalysts.

         <title>Sustainable Design of Structural and Functional Polymers for a Circular Economy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural and functional polymers provide functions, sustainability benefits, and CO2 savings during their use phase, but present challenges at end of life. Polymer science and adjacent disciplines can enable a circular economy of polymers via biodegradation or recycling through the application of strategies for molecular and system design that leverage the latest advances in the field.







Abstract
To achieve a sustainable circular economy, polymer production must start transitioning to recycled and biobased feedstock and accomplish CO2 emission neutrality. This is not only true for structural polymers, such as in packaging or engineering applications, but also for functional polymers in liquid formulations, such as adhesives, lubricants, thickeners or dispersants. At their end of life, polymers must be either collected and recycled via a technical pathway, or be biodegradable if they are not collectable. Advances in polymer chemistry and applications, aided by computational material science, open the way to addressing these issues comprehensively by designing for recyclability and biodegradability. This Review explores how scientific progress, together with emerging regulatory frameworks, societal expectations and economic boundary conditions, paint pathways for the transformation towards a circular economy of polymers.

         <title>Deciphering the Biological Activities of Antifungal Agents with Chemical Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rising percentage of fungal pathogens resistant to antifungal drugs and fungicides emphasizes the threat that they pose to animal and human health and global food security. This Minireview outlines the pivotal role of chemical biology in uncovering biological activities, detecting resistance, and in characterizing the interactions between antifungal agents and their targets.







Abstract
The growing number of fungal infections caused by pathogens resistant to one or more classes of antifungal drugs emphasizes the threat that these microorganisms pose to animal and human health and global food security. Open questions remain regarding the mechanisms of action of the limited repertoire of antifungal agents, making it challenging to rationally develop more efficacious therapeutics. In recent years, the use of chemical biology approaches has resolved some of these questions and has provided new promising concepts to guide the design of antifungal agents.

&lt;p&gt;The rising percentage of fungal pathogens resistant to antifungal drugs and fungicides emphasizes the threat that they pose to animal and human health and global food security. This Minireview outlines the pivotal role of chemical biology in uncovering biological activities, detecting resistance, and in characterizing the interactions between antifungal agents and their targets.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growing number of fungal infections caused by pathogens resistant to one or more classes of antifungal drugs emphasizes the threat that these microorganisms pose to animal and human health and global food security. Open questions remain regarding the mechanisms of action of the limited repertoire of antifungal agents, making it challenging to rationally develop more efficacious therapeutics. In recent years, the use of chemical biology approaches has resolved some of these questions and has provided new promising concepts to guide the design of antifungal agents. By focusing on examples from studies carried out in recent years, this minireview describes the key roles that probes based on antifungal agents and their derivatives have played in uncovering details about their activities, in detecting resistance, and in characterizing the interactions between these agents and their targets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interfaces with Fluorinated Amphiphiles: Superstructures and Microfluidics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated amphiphiles show interfacial properties distinctively different from ordinary nonfluorinated amphiphiles, such as unique and highly branched superstructures and better stabilization of microdroplets. Further fluorine&#8208;specific phenomena of fluorinated amphiphiles can be observed at solid/liquid interfaces, such as during their adsorption on fluorous adsorber materials or formation of amphiphobic surface coatings upon cross&#8208;linking.







Abstract
This Minireview discusses recent developments in research on the interfacial phenomena of fluorinated amphiphiles, with a focus on applications that exploit the unique and manifold interfacial properties associated with these amphiphiles. Most notably, fluorinated amphiphiles form stable aggregates with often distinctly different morphologies compared to their nonfluorinated counterparts. Consequently, fluorinated surfactants have found wide use in high&#8208;performance applications such as microfluidic&#8208;assisted screening. Additionally, their fluorine&#8208;specific behaviour at solid/liquid interfaces, such as the formation of superhydrophobic coatings after deposition on surfaces, will be discussed. As fluorinated surfactants and perfluorinated materials in general pose potential environmental threats, recent developments in their remediation based on their adsorption onto fluorinated surfaces will be evaluated.

         <title>Elastic Moduli: a Tool for Understanding Chemical Bonding and Thermal Transport in Thermoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elastic moduli are fundamentally connected to chemical bonding, making them a powerful tool for in&#8208;depth studies of trends in sound velocity and anharmonicity in thermoelectric materials.







Abstract
The elastic behavior of a material can be a powerful tool to decipher thermal transport. In thermoelectrics, measuring the elastic moduli&#8212;directly tied to sound velocity&#8212;is critical to understand trends in lattice thermal conductivity, as well as study bond anharmonicity and phase transitions, given the sensitivity of elastic moduli to the chemical bonding. In this review, we introduce the basics of elasticity and explain the origin of high&#8208;temperature lattice softening from a bonding perspective. We then review elasticity data throughout classes of thermoelectrics, and explore trends in sound velocity, anharmonicity, and thermal conductivity. We reveal how experimental sound velocities can improve the accuracy of common thermal conductivity models and present a critical discussion of Gr&#252;neisen parameter estimates from elastic moduli. Readers will be equipped with tools to leverage elasticity measurements or calculations to accurately interpret thermal transport trends.

         <title>Electronically Ambivalent Hydrodefluorination of Aryl&#8208;CF3 groups enabled by Electrochemical Deep&#8208;Reduction on a Ni Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a general procedure for the direct mono&#8208; and di&#8208;hydrodefluorination of ArCF3 compounds. Exploiting the tunability of electrochemistry and the selectivity enabled by a Ni cathode, the deep reduction garners high selectivity with good to excellent yields up to gram scale. The late&#8208;stage peripheral editing of CF3 feedstocks to construct fluoromethyl moieties will aid the rapid diversification of lead&#8208;compounds and compound libraries.







Abstract
The Ar&#8208;CF2H moiety is featured in an increasing number of bioactive compounds due to its unique combination of properties. The hydrodefluorination of Ar&#8208;CF3 compounds is a direct and efficient route toward this motif. As reported methods for this transformation have focused on specific substrate families, herein we describe a general&#8212;electronically ambivalent&#8212;procedure for the single&#8208;step direct mono&#8208;hydrodefluorination of a variety of feedstock and functionalized Ar&#8208;CF3 compounds. Exploiting the inherent tunability of electrochemistry and the selectivity enabled by a Ni cathode, the deep reduction garners high selectivity for ArCF2H products, with good to excellent yields up to gram scale. The protocol has been extended to a single&#8208;step di&#8208;hydrodefluorination yielding benzyl fluorides. The late&#8208;stage peripheral editing of a single CF3 feedstock to construct fluoromethyl (CF2H, CFH2) moieties will aid the rapid diversification of lead&#8208;compounds and compound libraries.

         <title>Stereoselective Assembly of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Anionic Cages Dictated by Organophosphate&#8208;Based Chiral Nodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organophosphates are critically involved in biological signal transduction, and they can play a similar role in supramolecular systems. Organophosphates have now been utilized as chiral nodes to transfer asymmetry information to hydrogen&#8208;bonded anionic cages, with the supramolecular chirality readily modulated by encapsulated achiral guests, temperature, and protonation/deprotonation of the anions.







Abstract
Inspired by the signal transduction function of organophosphates in biological systems, bioactive organophosphates were utilized for the first time as chiral nodes to dictate the stereoselective assembly of hydrogen&#8208;bonded anionic cages. Phosphonomycin (antibiotics), tenofovir (antivirals), adenosine monophosphate (natural product, AMP) and clindamycin phosphate (antibiotics) were assembled with an achiral bis&#8208;monourea ligand, thereby leading to the stereoselective formation of quadruple or triple helicates. The extent of the stereoselectivity could be enhanced by either lowering the temperature or adding stronger&#8208;binding cations as templates. With the chiral anionic cages as the host, some enantioselectivity was achieved when binding chiral quaternary ammonium cations.

         <title>Easily Switchable 18&#960;&#8208;, 19&#960;&#8208;, and 20&#960;&#8208;Conjugation of Diazaporphyrin Double&#8208;Pincer Bispalladium Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of NiII 3,7,13,17&#8208;tetrapyridyl&#8208;5,15&#8208;diazaporphyrin with PdII ions has led to a highly twisted bispalladium complex, which shows an excellent ability to accept electrons and be readily reduced to a monocationic and a neutral species using weak reductants. A combination of spectroscopic studies and DFT calculations revealed that the palladium complexes exhibit aromaticity (dicationic state) and antiaromaticity (neutral state).







Abstract
NiII 3,7,13,17&#8208;tetrapyridyl&#8208;5,15&#8208;diazaporphyrin serves as a double tridentate ligand to PdII ions to provide a pincer&#8208;type bispalladium complex. Electrochemical analysis revealed that the bispalladium complex shows excellent ability to accept electrons and reversible redox properties due to the coordination of the two cationic PdII centers to the meso&#8208;nitrogen atoms. We isolated and characterized one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron reduction species of the bispalladium complex. The 20&#960; antiaromatic nature of the two&#8208;electron reduction species was confirmed by 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy, UV/Vis&#8208;near&#8208;IR (NIR) absorption spectra, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed highly twisted structures for the bispalladium complexes regardless of the oxidation state.

&lt;p&gt;The reaction of Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; 3,7,13,17-tetrapyridyl-5,15-diazaporphyrin with Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; ions has led to a highly twisted bispalladium complex, which shows an excellent ability to accept electrons and be readily reduced to a monocationic and a neutral species using weak reductants. A combination of spectroscopic studies and DFT calculations revealed that the palladium complexes exhibit aromaticity (dicationic state) and antiaromaticity (neutral state).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; 3,7,13,17-tetrapyridyl-5,15-diazaporphyrin serves as a double tridentate ligand to Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; ions to provide a pincer-type bispalladium complex. Electrochemical analysis revealed that the bispalladium complex shows excellent ability to accept electrons and reversible redox properties due to the coordination of the two cationic Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; centers to the &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-nitrogen atoms. We isolated and characterized one- and two-electron reduction species of the bispalladium complex. The 20&#960; antiaromatic nature of the two-electron reduction species was confirmed by &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy, UV/Vis-near-IR (NIR) absorption spectra, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. X-ray diffraction revealed highly twisted structures for the bispalladium complexes regardless of the oxidation state.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Single Electron Reduction of Mono&#8208;Fluoroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)/tBuOK system was reported for the photoreduction of mono&#8208;fluoroarenes. Mechanistic studies suggest the generation of NHC radical anion as a potent reductant, and the Ar&#8722;F bond cleavage proceeds via a concerted mechanism, where single electron transfer, Ar&#8722;F bond cleavage and KF bond formation take place simultaneously.







Abstract
Fluoroarenes are abundant and readily available feedstocks. However, due to the high reduction potentials of mono&#8208;fluoroarenes, their photoreduction remains a continuing challenge, motivating the development of efficient activation modes to address this issue. This report presents the blue light&#8208;induced N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed single electron reduction of mono&#8208;fluoroarenes for biaryl cross&#8208;couplings. We discovered that under blue light irradiation, NHC/tBuOK combination could construct powerful photoactive architectures to promote single electron transfer for Caryl&#8722;F bond reduction via forming highly reducing NHC radical anion. Notably, the strategy was also successful to reduce Caryl&#8722;O, Caryl&#8722;N, and Caryl&#8722;S bonds for biaryl cross&#8208;couplings.

         <title>Propargyl Alcohols as Bifunctional Reagents for Divergent Annulations of Biphenylamines via Dual C&#8722;H Functionalization/Dual Oxidative Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed divergent and regioselective annulation of biphenylamines with propargyl alcohols (PAs) is demonstrated. These annulations run through an unsymmetrical dual C&#8722;H functionalization via a C&#8801;C bond cleavage, or through a dual oxidative cyclization. The method accommodates a wide range of PAs and showcases late&#8208;stage diversification of some natural products.







Abstract
The C&#8722;H functionalization strategy provides access to valuable molecules that previously required convoluted synthetic attempts. Dual C&#8722;H unsymmetrical functionalization, with a single bifunctional reagent, is an effective tactic. Propargyl alcohols (PAs), despite containing a reactive C&#8801;C bond, have not been explored as building blocks via oxidative cleavage. Annulations via C&#8722;H activation are a versatile and synthetically attractive strategy. We disclose PA as a new bifunctional reagent for unsymmetrical dual C&#8722;H functionalization of biphenylamine for regioselectively annulated outcomes. On tuning the conditions, the annulation bifurcated towards an unusual dual oxidative cyclization. This method accommodates a wide range of PAs and showcases late&#8208;stage diversification of some natural products.

         <title>Simultaneous Detection of L&#8208;Lactate and D&#8208;Glucose Using DNA Aptamers in Human Blood Serum
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly specific DNA aptamer for L&#8208;lactate with a Kd of around 0.4&#8197;mM was selected, showing binding even in 90&#8201;% human serum. Multiplexed detection of two highly related biomarkers, L&#8208;lactate and D&#8208;glucose, was achieved in the same sample by using aptamer sensors labeled with different fluorophores.







Abstract
L&#8208;lactate is a key metabolite indicative of physiological states, glycolysis pathways, and various diseases such as sepsis, heart attack, lactate acidosis, and cancer. Detection of lactate has been relying on a few enzymes that need additional oxidants. In this work, DNA aptamers for L&#8208;lactate were obtained using a library&#8208;immobilization selection method and the highest affinity aptamer reached a Kd of 0.43&#8197;mM as determined using isothermal titration calorimetry. The aptamers showed up to 50&#8208;fold selectivity for L&#8208;lactate over D&#8208;lactate and had little responses to other closely related analogs such as pyruvate or 3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate. A fluorescent biosensor based on the strand displacement method showed a limit of detection of 0.55&#8197;mM L&#8208;lactate, and the sensor worked in 90&#8201;% serum. Simultaneous detection of L&#8208;lactate and D&#8208;glucose in the same solution was achieved. This work has broadened the scope of aptamers to simple metabolites and provided a useful probe for continuous and multiplexed monitoring.

         <title>Homochiral versus Heterochiral Dimeric Helical Foldamer Bundles: Chlorinated&#8208;Solvent&#8208;Dependent Self&#8208;Sorting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic foldamer helices form stable head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dimers in solution and in the solid state mediated by linear arrays of hydrogen bonds. The preference for dimerization between helices with opposite or identical handedness can be quantitatively reversed by the choice of chlorinated solvent.







Abstract
Aromatic oligoamide sequences programmed to fold into stable helical conformations were designed to display a linear array of hydrogen&#8208;bond donors and acceptors at their surface. Sequences were prepared by solid&#8208;phase synthesis. Solution 1H NMR spectroscopic studies and solid&#8208;state crystallographic structures demonstrated the formation of stable hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated dimeric helix bundles that could be either heterochiral (with a P and an M helix) or homochiral (with two P or two M helices). Formation of the hetero&#8208; or homochiral dimers could be driven quantitatively using different chlorinated solvents&#8212;exemplifying a remarkable case of either social or narcissistic chiral self&#8208;sorting or upon imposing absolute handedness to the helices to forbid PM species.

Floating electrolytic electrospray ionization provided a general solution for the in situ monitoring and characterization of electrochemical reaction intermediates by mass spectrometry. Its successful application in discovery and identification of active nitrene intermediates during electrochemical processes proved this platform a powerful tool for reaction&#8208;mechanism studies in the future.







Abstract
The in&#8208;depth study of electrochemical (EC) synthesis can require a powerful mass spectrometry (MS) analytical platform which can discover and identify fleeting intermediates in EC reactions. Here we report a floating electrolytic electrospray ionization (FE&#8208;ESI) strategy that can perform EC processes in a floating electrolytic cell and monitor intermediates by high&#8208;resolution MS. Compared with previous EC&#8208;MS methods, a significant advantage of FE&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS is that it allows one to modulate the electrolytic and electrospray process individually, ensuring its high sensitivity in discovering intermediates and universality to investigate redox reactions in different scenarios. This powerful platform has been successfully used to investigate the EC reductive coupling of p&#8208;tolylboronic acid and p&#8208;nitrotoluene. A series of nitrene intermediates were discovered and identified by FE&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS, indicating that a hidden mechanism involving nitrene formation might play a key role in EC reductive coupling process.

         <dc:description>
[Bis(monofluoroacetoxy)iodo]benzene, an efficient and alternative reagent for radical monofluoromethylation under visible&#8208;light copper(I) photoredox catalysis, provides access to CH2F&#8208;containing organic compounds. The broad utility of this radical monofluoromethylating reagent in alkene oxy&#8208;monofluoromethylation reactions, including for the synthesis of fluoromethylated amino acid derivatives and heterocycles, is demonstrated.







Abstract
A simple process for the oxy&#8208;monofluoromethylation of alkenes is described. In combination with visible&#8208;light copper(I) photoredox catalysis, an easily accessible iodine(III) reagent containing monofluoroacetoxy ligands serves as a powerful source of a monofluoromethyl (CH2F) radical, enabling the step economical synthesis of &#947;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;acetates from a broad range of olefinic substrates under mild conditions. Applications to late&#8208;stage diversification of alkenes derived from complex molecules, amino acids and the synthesis of fluoromethylated heterocycles are also demonstrated.

         <title>Medium&#8208;Ring Strategy Enables Multiple Resonance Emitters with Twisted Geometry and Fast Spin&#8208;Flip to Suppress Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>

The medium&#8208;ring molecular design strategy enables the first example of blue multi&#8208;resonance emitter with radiative decay rate (kR) as fast as 108&#8197;s&#8722;1 and reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC) as fast as 106&#8197;s&#8722;1 simultaneously. It exhibits superior electroluminescence performance with high efficiency and low efficiency roll&#8208;off.







Abstract
Suppressing aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) effect and reducing device efficiency roll&#8208;off are both crucial yet challenging for multi&#8208;resonance (MR) emitters. Herein, we put forward a medium&#8208;ring strategy to design efficient MR emitters that feature heptagonal tribenzo[b,d,f]azepine (TBA) donors. The highly twisted conformation enlarges the intermolecular distances between the MR&#8208;emitting cores, and thus suppresses ACQ effect. Meanwhile, the introduction of heptagonal donors enhances spin&#8208;orbital coupling, so as to accelerate reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process. This medium&#8208;ring strategy gives rise to the first example of blue MR emitter that simultaneously possesses radiative decay rate as fast as 108&#8197;s&#8722;1 and RISC rate as fast as 106&#8197;s&#8722;1. Accordingly, DTBA&#8208;B2N3 enables to assemble high&#8208;performance blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 30.9&#8201;% and alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;off (EQE1000: 20.5&#8201;%).

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Surfactant&#8208;Polyoxovanadate Soft Materials as Tuneable Vanadium Oxide Cathode Precursors for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decavanadate anions self&#8208;assemble with a dicationic surfactant to form ordered arrays which, when calcined, yield highly crystalline V2O5. In contrast, calcination of alkylammonium decavanadate leads to smaller V2O5 crystallites. The systems show contrasting, topology&#8208;dependent performance as cathode materials in Li&#8208;ion batteries, offering a route to the controlled preparation of V2O5 electrode materials that balance energy and rate performance.







Abstract
The mixing of [V10O28]6&#8722; decavanadate anions with a dicationic gemini surfactant (gem) leads to the spontaneous self&#8208;assembly of surfactant&#8208;templated nanostructured arrays of decavanadate clusters. Calcination of the material under air yields highly crystalline, sponge&#8208;like V2O5 (gem&#8208;V2O5). In contrast, calcination of the amorphous tetrabutylammonium decavanadate allows isolation of a more agglomerated V2O5 consisting of very small crystallites (TBA&#8208;V2O5). Electrochemical analysis of the materials&#8217; performance as lithium&#8208;ion intercalation electrodes highlights the role of morphology in cathode performance. The large crystallites and long&#8208;range microstructure of the gem&#8208;V2O5 cathode deliver higher initial capacity and superior capacity retention than TBA&#8208;V2O5. The smaller crystallite size and higher surface area of TBA&#8208;V2O5 allow faster lithium insertion and superior rate performance to gem&#8208;V2O5.

         <title>Selective Removal of Sulfate from Water by Precipitation with a Rigid Bis&#8208;amidinium Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A readily prepared bis&#8208;amidinium compound can achieve near quantitative precipitation of SO42&#8722; from water with complete selectivity over a range of other anions. The precipitant functions by fully dehydrating the sulfate anion and surrounding it with eight charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
A simple, readily prepared biphenyl bis&#8208;amidinium compound (1&#8901;Cl2) is able to selectively precipitate sulfate from water. The precipitant is effective at concentrations as low as 1&#8197;mM and shows complete selectivity against monovalent anions, and high selectivity even against CO32&#8722; and HPO42&#8722;. It is highly effective (&gt;90&#8201;% sulfate removed) in both seawater and highly acidic conditions relevant to mining waste&#8208;streams. X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals that 1&#8901;SO4 forms a tightly packed, anhydrous, structure where each sulfate anion receives eight hydrogen bonds from amidinium N&#8722;H hydrogen bond donors.

&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; from water with complete selectivity over a range of other anions. The precipitant functions by fully dehydrating the sulfate anion and surrounding it with eight charge-assisted hydrogen bonds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple, readily prepared biphenyl bis-amidinium compound (&lt;b&gt;1&#8901;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;) is able to selectively precipitate sulfate from water. The precipitant is effective at concentrations as low as 1&#8197;mM and shows complete selectivity against monovalent anions, and high selectivity even against CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. It is highly effective (&amp;gt;90&#8201;% sulfate removed) in both seawater and highly acidic conditions relevant to mining waste-streams. X-ray crystallography reveals that &lt;b&gt;1&#8901;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; forms a tightly packed, anhydrous, structure where each sulfate anion receives eight hydrogen bonds from amidinium N&#8722;H hydrogen bond donors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Promoted Intramolecular para&#8208;Cycloadditions on Simple Aromatics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the first synthesis of bridged bicycles through the dearomatization of sterically and electronically unbiased aryl fragments. The visible&#8208;light promoted method occurs at room temperature and has ample functional&#8208;group tolerance. The key to the difunctionalization of the aryl partner is the use of naphthalene as an additive, which stabilizes transient (bi)radicals through its extended &#960; cloud. This effect might lead to its broad use in radical sequences.







Abstract
Dearomative cycloadditions are a powerful tool to access a large chemical space exploiting simple and ubiquitous building blocks. The energetic burden due to the loss of aromaticity has however greatly limited their synthetic potential. We devised a general intramolecular method that overcomes these limitations thanks to the photosensitization of allenamides. The visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted process gives complex [2.2.2]&#8208;(hetero)&#8208;bicyclooctadienes at room temperature, likely through the stabilization of transient (bi)radicals by naphthalene. The reaction tolerates several valuable functionalities, offering a convenient handle for a myriad of applications, including original isoindoles and metal complexes.

         <title>Molecular Level Modulation of Anthraquinone&#8208;containing Resorcinol&#8208;formaldehyde Resin Photocatalysts for H2O2 Production with Exceeding 1.2&#8201;% Efficiency</title>

         <dc:description>
Electron&#8208;deficient 1,4&#8208;dihydroxyanthraquinone (DHAQ) molecules were adopted to modulate the donor/acceptor ratio in resorcinol&#8208;formaldehyde (RF) resin at the molecular level. The RF&#8208;DHAQ with matching donor and acceptor displays enhanced charge separation ability, lower energy barrier and overall photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by dual&#8208;pathway with solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency exceeding 1.2&#8201;%.







Abstract
Designing polymeric photocatalysts at the molecular level to modulate the photogenerated charge behavior is a promising and challenging strategy for efficient hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) photosynthesis. Here, we introduce electron&#8208;deficient 1,4&#8208;dihydroxyanthraquinone (DHAQ) into the framework of resorcinol&#8208;formaldehyde (RF) resin, which modulates the donor/acceptor ratio from the perspective of molecular design for promoting the charge separation. Interestingly, H2O2 can be produced via oxygen reduction and water oxidation pathways, verified by isotopic labeling and in situ characterization techniques. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidate that DHAQ can reduce the energy barrier for H2O2 production. RF&#8208;DHAQ exhibits excellent overall photosynthesis of H2O2 with a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) efficiency exceeding 1.2&#8201;%. This work opens a new avenue to design polymeric photocatalysts at the molecular level for high&#8208;efficiency artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Electroreduction of CO2 on Au(310)@Cu High&#8208;index Facets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Au(310)@Cu truncated ditetragonal prisms (DTPs) enhance the activity and selectivity for CO2 electromethanation. Elemental mapping analysis shows Cu surface layers are uniformly distributed on the Au {310} facets of the DTPs. Operando Fourier transform infrared spectra show reactive adsorbed *CO as the main intermediate. CO stripping experiments reveal the high&#8208;index facets enhance the *CO formation followed by rapid desorption or hydrogenation.







Abstract
The chemical selectivity and faradaic efficiency of high&#8208;index Cu facets for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is investigated. More specifically, shape&#8208;controlled nanoparticles enclosed by Cu {hk0} facets are fabricated using Cu multilayer deposition at three distinct layer thicknesses on the surface facets of Au truncated ditetragonal nanoprisms (Au DTPs). Au DTPs are shapes enclosed by 12 high&#8208;index {310} facets. Facet angle analysis confirms DTP geometry. Elemental mapping analysis shows Cu surface layers are uniformly distributed on the Au {310} facets of the DTPs. The 7&#8197;nm Au@Cu DTPs high&#8208;index {hk0} facets exhibit a CH4&#8201;:&#8201;CO product ratio of almost 10&#8201;:&#8201;1 compared to a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio for the reference 7&#8197;nm Au@Cu nanoparticles (NPs). Operando Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectra disclose reactive adsorbed *CO as the main intermediate, whereas CO stripping experiments reveal the high&#8208;index facets enhance the *CO formation followed by rapid desorption or hydrogenation.

         <title>Selective Preparation of Phosphorus Mononitride (P&#8801;N) from Phosphinoazide and Reversible Oxidation to Phosphinonitrene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interstellar candidate phosphorus mononitride PN, a metastable species, was generated through high&#8208;vacuum flash pyrolysis of (o&#8208;phenyldioxyl)phosphinoazide in cryogenic matrices. Although the PN stretching band was not directly detected because of its low infrared intensity and possible overlaps with other strong bands, o&#8208;benzoquinone, carbon monoxide, and cyclopentadienone as additional fragmentation products were clearly identified. Moreover, an elusive o&#8208;benzoquinone&#8208;PN complex formed when (o&#8208;phenyldioxyl)phosphinoazide was exposed to UV irradiation at &#955; = 254 nm. Its recombination to (o&#8208;phenyldioxyl)&#8208;&#955;5&#8208;phosphinonitrile was observed upon irradiation with the light &#955; = 523 nm, which demonstrates for the first time the reactivity of PN towards an organic molecule. Free energy profile computations at the B3LYP/def2&#8208;TZVP density functional theory level reveal a concerted mechanism. To provide further evidence, UV/Vis spectra of the precursor and the irradiation products were recorded and agree well with time&#8208;dependent DFT computations.</dc:description>

         <title>A universal synthesis strategy for tuneable metal&#8208;organic framework nanohybrid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with encapsulated pre&#8208;formed nanoparticles (NPs) enjoy a vastly expanded application potential in catalysis, filtration, and sensing. In the process of integrating pre&#8208;formed NPs, the selection of suitable core&#8208;NPs, such as capping agent or self&#8208;sacrificing template modified NPs, have yielded partial successes in overcoming the lattice mismatch. However, restrictions on the choice of NPs not only limit the diversity, but also affect the properties of nanohybrids. To this date, no universally applicable synthesis for MOF&#8208;nanohybrids emerged that covers the full diversity of all possible core&#8208;shell combinations. Here, we show a versatile synthesis strategy using a representative set of seven MOF&#8208;shells (ZIF&#8208;zni, ZIF&#8208;8, ZIF&#8208;67, FJU&#8208;30, MIL&#8208;88(Fe), HKUST&#8208;1, and MOF&#8208;74(Co)) and six NP&#8208;cores (Ag, Au, NaYF4, &#946;&#8208;FeOOH, Fe2O3 and Ni3[Fe(CN)6]2) that are fine&#8208;tuned to incorporate from single to hundreds of cores in mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, tri&#8208; and quaternary composites. This method does not require the presence of any specific surface structures or functionalities on the pre&#8208;formed cores. This key strategy is to regulate the rate of diffusion of alkaline vapours that deprotonate the organic building blocks and trigger the controlled MOF&#8208;growth and encapsulation of NP&#8208;cores. This strategy is expected to pave the way for the exploration of sophisticated MOF&#8208;nanohybrids that draws from the full range of hitherto known MOF&#8208;architectures and core&#8208;compositions.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An emerging strategy in the design of efficient gas storage technologies is the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive physisorbents which undergo transformations in response to a particular stimulus, such as pressure, heat or light. Herein, we report two isostructural light modulated adsorbents (LMAs) containing bis&#8208;3&#8208;thienylcyclopentene&#160;(BTCP), LMA&#8208;1 [Cd(BTCP)(DPT)2] (DPT = 2,5&#8208;diphenylbenzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylate)&#160;and LMA&#8208;2 [Cd(BTCP)(FDPT)2] (FDPT = 5&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2&#8208;diphenylbenzene&#8208;1,4,dicarboxylate). Both LMAs underwent&#160;pressure induced switching transformations from non&#8208;porous to porous via adsorption of N2, CO2 and C2H2. LMA&#8208;1 exhibited multi&#8208;step adsorption while LMA&#8208;2 showed a single&#8208;step adsorption isotherm. The light responsive nature of the BTPC ligand in both frameworks was exploited with irradiation of LMA&#8208;1 resulting in a 55% maximum reduction of CO2 uptake at 298 K. This study reports the first example of a switching sorbent (closed to open) that can be further modulated by light.</dc:description>

         <title>Circumcoronenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circumcoronene, a hexagonal graphene fragment with six zigzag edges, has been the focus of theoretical studies for many years, but its synthesis in solution has remained a challenge. In this study, we present a facile method for synthesizing three derivatives of circumcoronene using Br&#248;nsted/Lewis acid&#8208;mediated cyclization of vinyl ether or alkyne. Their structures were confirmed through X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Bond length analysis, NMR measurement, and theoretical calculations showed that circumcoronene mostly follows Clar's bonding model and exhibits dominant local aromaticity. Its absorption and emission spectra are similar to those of the smaller hexagonal coronene due to its six&#8208;fold symmetry.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Circumcoronene, a hexagonal graphene fragment with six zigzag edges, has been the focus of theoretical studies for many years, but its synthesis in solution has remained a challenge.

         <title>Inverse CO2/C2H2 Separation with MFU&#8208;4 and Selectivity Reversal via Postsynthetic Ligand Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although many porous materials, including metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), have been reported to selectively adsorb C2H2 in C2H2/CO2 separation processes, CO2&#8208;selective sorbents are much less common. Here, we report the remarkable performance of MFU&#8208;4 (Zn5Cl4(bbta)3, bbta = benzo&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;bistriazolate) toward inverse CO2/C2H2 separation. The MOF facilitates kinetic separation of CO2 from C2H2, enabling the generation of high purity C2H2 (&gt;98%) with good productivity in dynamic breakthrough experiments. Adsorption kinetics measurements and computational studies show C2H2 is excluded from MFU&#8208;4 by narrow pore windows formed by Zn&#8211;Cl groups. Postsynthetic F&#8211;/Cl&#8211; ligand exchange was used to synthesize an analogue (MFU&#8208;4&#8208;F) with expanded pore apertures, resulting in equilibrium C2H2/CO2 separation with reversed selectivity compared to MFU&#8208;4. MFU&#8208;4&#8208;F also exhibits a remarkably high C2H2 adsorption capacity (6.7 mmol/g), allowing fuel grade C2H2 (98% purity) to be captured from C2H2/CO2 mixtures and harvested by room temperature desorption.</dc:description>

         <title>Optical and Electrochemical Probes for Monitoring Cytochrome c in Subcellular Compartments During Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cytochrome c (Cyt. c) is a key initiator of caspases activating cell apoptosis. The spatiotemporal evaluation of the contents of Cyt. c in cellular subdomains and the detection of Cyt. c delivery between cellular domains upon apoptosis is important to probe cell viabilities. We introduce an optical probe and an electrochemical probe for the quantitative assessment of Cyt. c in cellular subdomains at the single cell levels. The optical or electrochemical probes are functionalized with photoresponsive o&#8208;nitrobenzylphosphate ester caged Cyt. c aptamer constituents. These are uncaged by light stimuli at single cell subdomains, allowing the spatiotemporal detection of Cyt. c through the formation of Cyt. c/aptamer complexes at non&#8208;apoptotic or apoptotic constraints. The probes are applied to distinguish the contents of Cyt. c in cellular subdomains of epithelial MCF&#8208;10A breast cells and malignant MCF&#8208;7 and MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 breast cells under apoptotic/non&#8208;apoptotic conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Template&#8208;Directed Synthesis of a Spoked 18&#8208;Porphyrin Nanoring</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rings of porphyrins mimic natural light&#8208;harvesting chlorophyll arrays and provide insights into electronic delocalization, providing a motivation for creating larger nanorings with closely spaced porphyrin units. Here, we demonstrate the first synthesis of a macrocycle consisting entirely of 5,15&#8208;linked porphyrins. This porphyrin octadecamer was constructed using a covalent six&#8208;armed template, made by cobalt&#8208;catalyzed cyclotrimerization of an H&#8208;shaped tolan with porphyrin trimer ends. The porphyrins around the circumference of the nanoring were linked together by intramolecular oxidative&#160;meso&#8208;meso&#160;coupling and partial &#946;&#8208;&#946; fusion, to give a nanoring consisting of six edge&#8208;fused zinc(II) porphyrin dimer units and six un&#8208;fused nickel(II) porphyrins. STM imaging on a gold surface confirms the size and shape of the spoked 18&#8208;porphyrin nanoring (calculated diameter: 4.7 nm).</dc:description>

         <title>Multimodal Analysis of Light&#8208;Driven Water Oxidation in Nanoporous Block Copolymer Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterogeneous light&#8208;driven catalysis is a cornerstone of sustainable energy conversion. Most catalytic studies focus on bulk analyses of the hydrogen and oxygen evolved, which impede the correlation of matrix heterogeneities, molecular features, and bulk reactivity. Here, we report studies of a heterogenized catalyst / photosensitizer system using a polyoxometalate water oxidation catalyst and a model, molecular photosensitizer that were co&#8208;immobilized within a nanoporous block copolymer membrane. Via operando scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM), light&#8208;induced oxygen evolution was determined using sodium peroxodisulfate (Na2S2O8) as sacrificial electron acceptor. Ex situ element analyses provided spatially resolved information on the local concentration and distribution of the molecular components. Infrared attenuated total reflection (IR&#8208;ATR) studies of the modified membranes showed no degradation of the water oxidation catalyst under the reported light&#8208;driven conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic C&#8211;C Cleavage of Methylenecyclobutanes for &#947;,&#948;&#8208;Unsaturated Aldehydes by Strain Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radical additions onto olefines have surfaced as an increasingly powerful strategy for the synthesis of difunctionalized scaffolds. However, despite of major advances, known approaches continue to be largely limited to two manifolds, namely 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of alkenes and remote difunctionalization via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). Herein, we describe a mechanistically distinct approach by photo&#8208;induced carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8211;C) activation/ring&#8208;opening to access  &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes from methylenecyclobutanols and sulfonyl chlorides by strain release. Remarkably, the sulfonyl motif on the products was easily removed by another photocatalytic process, which enabled the concise assembly of the natural product alatanone A. The synthetic utility of our approach was reflected by versatile functional group tolerance, ample substrate scope, and scalability. The photocatalysis represents a conceptually distinct alternative to existing approaches for remote 1,4&#8208;diversifications, with a double bond remaining in the thus obtained products.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Structurally Diverse Azulene&#8208;embedded Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by Knoevenagel&#8208;type Condensation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The research interest in azulene&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) has significantly increased recently, but the lack of efficient synthetic strategy impedes the investigation of their structure&#8208;property relation and further opto&#8208;electronic applications. Here we report a novel modular synthetic strategy towards diverse azulene&#8208;embedded PAHs via a tandem Suzuki coupling and base&#8208;promoted Knoevenagel&#8208;type condensation with good yields and great structural versatility, including non&#8208;alternant thiophene&#8208;rich PAHs, butterfly&#8208; or Z&#8208;shaped PAHs bearing two azulene units, and the first example of two&#8208;azulene&#8208;embedded double [5]helicene. The structural topology, aromaticity and photophysical properties were investigated by NMR, X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis and UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy assisted by DFT calculations. This strategy provides a new platform for rapidly synthesizing unexplored non&#8208;alternant PAHs or even graphene nanoribbons with multiple azulene units.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Level Regulation of Cobalt Single&#8208;Atom Nanozymes: Engineering High&#8208;Efficiency Catalase Mimics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanozymes aim to mimic the highly evolved active centers of natural enzymes. Despite progress in nanozyme engineering, their catalytic performance is much less favorable compared with natural enzymes. This study shows that precise control over the atomic configuration of the active centers of Co single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) enables the rational regulation of their catalase&#8208;like performance guided by theorical calculations. The constructed Co&#8208;N3PS SAzyme exhibits an excellent catalase&#8208;like activity and kinetics, exceeding the representative controls of Co&#8208;based SAzymes with different atomic configurations. Moreover, we developed an ordered structure&#8208;oriented coordination design strategy for rationally engineering SAzymes and established a correlation between the structure and enzyme&#8208;like performance. This work demonstrates that precise control over the active centers of SAzymes is an efficient strategy to mimic the highly evolved active sites of natural enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Coordination of Iridium Single&#8208;atom IrN3O Boosting Formic Acid Oxidation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational design of the proximal coordination of an active site to achieve its optimum catalytic activity is the ultimate goal in single&#8208;atom catalysis, but still challenging. Here, we report theoretical prediction and experimental realization of an asymmetrically coordinated iridium single&#8208;atom catalyst (IrN3O) for the formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR). Theoretical calculations reveal that the substitution of one or two nitrogen with more electronegative oxygen in the symmetric IrN4 motif splits and downshifts the Ir 5d orbitals with respect to the Fermi level, moderating the binding strength of key intermediates on IrN4&#8208;xOx (x= 1, 2) sites, especially that the IrN3O motif shows ideal activity for FAOR with a near&#8208;zero overpotential. The as&#8208;designed asymmetric Ir motifs were realized by pyrolyzing Ir precursor with oxygen&#8208;rich glucose and nitrogen&#8208;rich melamine, exhibiting a mass activity of 25 and 87 times greater than those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pd/C and Pt/C, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Flexible Metal&#8210;Phenolic Networks with Guest Responsiveness via Intermolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flexible metal&#8211;organic materials are of growing interest owing to their ability to undergo reversible structural transformations under external stimuli. Here, we report flexible metal&#8210;phenolic networks (MPNs) featuring stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior to diverse solute guests. The competitive coordination of metal ions to phenolic ligands of multiple coordination sites and solute guests (e.g., glucose) primarily determines the responsive behavior of the MPNs, as revealed experimentally and computationally. Glucose molecules can be embedded into the dynamic MPNs upon mixing, leading to the reconfiguration of the metal&#8210;organic networks and thus changes in their physicochemical properties for targeting applications. This study expands the library of stimuli&#8208;responsive flexible metal&#8210;organic materials and the understanding of intermolecular interactions between metal&#8210;organic materials and solute guests, which is essential for the rational design of responsive materials for broader applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Graphdiyne for Solar Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphdiyne (GDY) with a direct bandgap, excellent carrier mobility and uniform pores, is regarded as a promising photocatalytic material for solar energy conversion, although the development of GDY in photocatalysis is far behind. Herein, the distinctive structure, adjustable bandgap, and electronic properties of GDY for photocatalysis is firstly summarized. The construction and progress of GDY&#8208;based photocatalysts for solar energy conversion, including H2 evolution reaction (HER), CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and N2 reduction reaction (NRR) are then elaborated. At last, the challenges and perspectives in developing GDY&#8208;based photocatalysts for solar fuel production are discussed. It is anticipated that a timely review will be helpful for rapid progress of GDY in solar energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Janus Effect of Lewis Acid Enables One&#8208;Step Block Copolymerization of Ethylene Oxide and N&#8209;Sulfonyl Aziridine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One&#8208;step sequence&#8208;selective block copolymerization requires stringent catalytic control of monomers relative activity and enchainment order. It has been especially rare for AnBm&#8208;type block copolymers from simple binary monomer mixtures. Here, ethylene oxide (EO) and N&#8209;sulfonyl aziridine (Az) compose a valid pair provided with a bicomponent metal&#8208;free catalyst. Optimal Lewis acid/base ratio allows the two monomers to strictly block&#8208;copolymerize in a reverse order (EO&#8208;first) as compared with the conventional anionic route (Az&#8208;first). Livingness of the copolymerization facilitates one&#8208;pot synthesis of multiblock copolymers by addition of mixed monomers in batches. Calculation results reveal that a Janus effect of Lewis acid on the two monomers is key to enlarge the activity difference and reverse the enchainment order.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterobimetallic NiFe Cooperative Molecular Water Oxidation Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We reported herein the development of heterobimetallic NiFe molecular platform to understand NiFe synergistic effect in water oxidation catalysis. Compared to homonuclear bimetallic compounds (NiNi and FeFe), NiFe complex possesses more remarkable catalytic water oxidation performance. Mechanistic studies suggest that this remarkable difference is attributed to the fact that NiFe synergy can effectively promote O&#8208;O bond formation. The generated NiIII(&#956;&#8208;O)FeIV=O is the key intermediate and O&#8208;O bond was formed via intramolecular oxyl&#8208;oxo coupling between bridged O radical and terminal FeIV=O moiety.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Construction of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Disubstituted Piperazinones Enabled by Benzilic Amide Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unprecedent asymmetric catalytic benzilic amide rearrangement for the synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstitutedpiperazinones is reported. The reaction proceeds via a domino [4+1] imidazolidination/formal 1,2&#8208;nitrogen shift/1,2&#8208;aryl or alkyl migration sequence, employing readily available vicinal tricarbonyl compounds and 1,2&#8208;diamines as starting materials. This approach provides an efficient access to chiral C3&#8208;disubsituted piperazin&#8208;2&#8208;ones with high enantiocontrol, which are exceedingly difficult to access from the existing synthetic methodologies. The observed enantioselectivity was proposed to be controlled by dynamic kinetic resolution in the 1,2&#8208;aryl/alkyl migration step. The resulting densely functionalized products are versatile building blocks to bioactive natural products, drug molecules and their analogues.</dc:description>
