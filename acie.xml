      <title>One&#8208;step versatile room temperature synthesis of metal(IV) carboxylate MOFs</title>
      <dc:description>The development of room temperature green syntheses of robust MOFs is of great interest to meet the demand of the sustainable chemistry and is a pre&#8208;requisite for the incorporation of functional but fragile compounds in water stable MOFs. However, only few ambient conditions routes to produce metal(IV) based MOFs have been reported and most of them suffer from a very low yield and/or multiple steps that preclude their use for most applications. We report here a new versatile one&#8208;step synthesis of a series of highly porous M  6  oxoclusters based MOFs (M= Zr, Hf, Ce) at room temperature, including 8 or 12&#8208;connected micro/mesoporous solids with different functionalized organic ligands. The resulting compounds show varying degrees of defectivity, particularly for 12&#8208;connected phases, while maintaining the chemical stability of the parent MOFs. We propose first insights for the efficient MOF preparation based on  In&#8208;situ  kinetics observations. Remarkably, the synthetic versatility not only allows an efficient room temperature synthesis with a high space&#8208;time yield, but also gives possibility to tune the particle size, which therefore paves the way for their practical use.</dc:description>

      <title>Mn&#8722;O Covalency Governs the Intrinsic Activity of Co&#8208;Mn Spinel Oxides for Boosted Peroxymonosulfate Activation</title>
      <dc:description>
Bimetallic spinel oxides are efficient catalysts for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation but the catalytic mechanism is unclear. The critical role of Mn&#8722;O covalency in determining the intrinsic activity of Co3&#8722;xMnxO4 and a new mechanism of Co&#8211;Mn synergy are revealed by Wen&#8208;Wei Li et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202010828). Co strengthens Mn&#8722;O covalency in the octahedral configuration of Co3&#8722;xMnxO4, which lowers the charge transfer energy of the MnOh&#8211;PMS interaction and drastically accelerates MnVI/MnIII redox cycling.

      <title>The Conformational Equilibrium of the Neuropeptide Y2 Receptor in Bilayer Membranes</title>
      <dc:description>
NMR spectroscopy sheds light on receptor activation: Molecular switches are conserved motifs of G protein&#8208;coupled receptors that undergo structural changes during activation. Tryptophan residues are often part of these molecular switches and thus provide insights in the activation mechanism of the molecule. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202006075) Daniel Huster et&#8197;al. use NMR spectroscopy to monitor structural alterations of the neuropeptide Y1 receptor with atomic resolution observable by changes in the chemical shifts of six native tryptophan residues.

      <title>Cation Additive Enabled Rechargeable LiOH&#8208;Based Lithium&#8211;Oxygen Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Achieving rechargeable lithium oxygen batteries with reversible LiOH formation/decomposition is challenging. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202010745), Jun Lu, Khalil Amine, and co&#8208;workers report that a cation additive can tune the solvation environment of Li ions, resulting in the change of cell chemistry to form LiOH. LiOH is proved to be reversibly charged at a low voltage, without the presence of redox mediators or catalysts.

Strong intramolecular charge transfer in push&#8211;pull systems revealing panchromatic spectral coverage is demonstrated in the Research Article by Rajneesh Misra, Francis D'Souza and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202013036). Here, triphenylamine&#8208;tetracyanobutadiene, a high&#8208;energy charge transfer species is covalently linked to a near&#8208;IR sensitizer, azaBODIPY. Efficient charge separation is observed either by the high&#8208;energy charge transfer or the low&#8208;energy near&#8208;IR excitations. The inset flower pictures show different colors similar to that observed in the present set of compounds due to charge transfer phenomenon.

      <dc:description>
A DNA assembly denoted as micrometer&#8208;sized DNA track was engineered by Meng Liu, Yingfu Li, et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202010693). The resultant DNA track is made of a long&#8208;chain DNA with a primer&#8208;binding domain at its 3&#8242; end and circa 1000 repeating sequence units at its 5&#8242; end each carrying a DNA anchor, and can serve as an efficient template for in vitro DNA synthesis by DNA polymerases.

      <title>Porphyrinic Zirconium MOFs as Heterogeneous Photocatalysts for PET&#8208;RAFT Polymerization and Stereolithography</title>
      <dc:description>In this study, porphyrinic zirconium (Zr) MOFs were investigated as heterogeneous photocatalysts for photoinduced electron transfer&#8211;reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) polymerization of various monomers under a broad range of wavelengths, producing polymers with high monomer conversions, narrow molecular weight distributions, low dispersity and good chain&#8208;end fidelity. Screening of various porphyrinic Zr&#8208;MOFs (Zn) demonstrated that MOF&#8208;525 (Zn) with the smallest size had the best photocatalytic activity in PET&#8208;RAFT polymerization, due to the enhanced dispersion and light penetration. Oxygen tolerance and temporal control were also demonstrated during MOF catalyzed PET&#8208;RAFT. Results suggested that the polymerization rates were significantly affected by changing the size and surface area of MOFs, and the heterogeneous MOF photocatalysts could be easily separated and recycled for up to five independent PET&#8208;RAFT polymerizations without an obvious decrease in efficiency. Finally, the MOF photocatalysts were utilized to create three&#8208;dimensional polymeric objects with high resolution via visible light mediated stereolithography in an open&#8208;air environment.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>An intriguing strategy for copper&#8208;catalyzed hydroxymethylation of alkynes with CO2  and hydrosilane was developed. Switched on/off a proton source, e.g. tBuOH, direct hydroxymethylation and reductive hydroxymethylation could be triggered selectively, delivering a series of allylic alcohols and homobenzylic alcohols respectively, with high levels of Z/E, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Such a selective synthesis is attributed to the differences in response of vinylcopper intermediate to proton and CO2  . The protonation of vinylcopper species is demonstrated to be prior to hydroxymethylation, thus allowing a diversion from direct alkyne hydroxymethylation to reductive hydroxymethylation in the presence of suitable proton.</dc:description>

      <title>Ultra&#8208;Low Loading Pt/CeO2 Catalysts: Ceria Facet Effect Affords Improved Pairwise Selectivity for Parahydrogen Enhanced NMR</title>
      <dc:description>Oxide supports with well&#8208;defined shapes are beneficial in catalysis studies as they enable investigations on the effects of surface structure on metal&#8208;support interactions as well as correlations to catalytic activity and selectivity. Here, a modified atomic layer deposition technique was developed to achieve ultra&#8208;low loadings (8&#8208;16 ppm) of Pt on shaped ceria nanocrystals. By using octahedra and cubes, which expose exclusively (111) and (100) surfaces respectively, the effect of CeO2  surface facet on the Pt&#8208;CeO2  interactions under reducing conditions was revealed. Strong electronic interactions were found to result in electron&#8208;deficient Pt species on the CeO2  (111) after reduction, which increased the stability of the atomically dispersed Pt and afforded significantly higher NMR signal enhancement compared with the electron&#8208;rich platinum on the CeO  2  (100), and a factor of two higher pairwise selectivity (6.1 %) than previously reported for a monometallic heterogeneous Pt catalyst.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Oxide supports with well&#8208;defined shapes are beneficial in catalysis studies as they enable investigations on the effects of surface structure on metal&#8208;support interactions as well as correlations to catalytic activity and selectivity. Here, a modified atomic layer deposition technique was developed to achieve ultra&#8208;low loadings (8&#8208;16 ppm) of Pt on shaped ceria nanocrystals. By using octahedra and cubes, which expose exclusively (111) and (100) surfaces respectively, the effect of CeO2  surface facet on the Pt&#8208;CeO2  interactions under reducing conditions was revealed. Strong electronic interactions were found to result in electron&#8208;deficient Pt species on the CeO2  (111) after reduction, which increased the stability of the atomically dispersed Pt and afforded significantly higher NMR signal enhancement compared with the electron&#8208;rich platinum on the CeO  2  (100), and a factor of two higher pairwise selectivity (6.1 %) than previously reported for a monometallic heterogeneous Pt catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The employment of the identical crystal structures of Ti&#8208;LLZTO with LLZTO enables a seamless contact and a barrier less Li  +  transport between them. In the same preparation condition, the densities of Ti&#8208;LLZTO pellets are obviously higher than that of the undoped LLZTO. In addition, with an  in&#8208;situ  reduction of Ti&#8208;LLZTO by Li&#8208;metal, the interfacial wettability was improved and a mixed ion&#8208;electron conducting layer was established. Both features would not only reduce defects/pores on interface, but also homogenizes the interfacial ionic/electronic flux, facilitating the reduction of interfacial resistance and suppression of dendrites.

      <title>Direct Imaging of Atomic Permeation Through a Vacancy Defect in the Carbon Lattice</title>
      <dc:description>
Atomic vacancies in graphenic lattice can be applied as sieve pores for sieving atoms, ions and molecules. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202010630), A. Khlobystov, U. Kaiser and co&#8208;workers report the direct observation of the permeation of single palladium atoms passing one&#8208;by&#8208;one through a vacancy defect in a single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube by transmission electron microscopy. The curvature of the carbon lattice drives the permeation in the direction from the concave to the convex side of the membrane due to the difference between metal&#8211;carbon bonding with opposite sides.

      <title>Codoping of Lead&#8208;Free Double Perovskites Promotes Near&#8208;Infrared Photoluminescence</title>
      <dc:description>
Efficient near&#8208;infrared photoluminescence in lead&#8208;free double perovskite bulk materials has been achieved by Nag and co&#8208;workers through a codoping strategy. The introduction of Bi3+ ions leads to the formation of a new energy state that absorb lower&#8208;energy light. The excited state thus formed, excites f&#8208;electrons of Er3+ or Yb3+ ions, and the subsequent relaxation of the f&#8208;electrons results in near&#8208;infrared photoluminescence.







Abstract
In the rapidly developing smart era, near&#8208;infrared luminescent materials have important applications in various fields that are closely related to people. Nag and co&#8208;workers provided a first codoping strategy to achieve efficient near&#8208;infrared photoluminescence in lead&#8208;free double perovskite materials. Through the introduction of Bi3+ ions, a new energy state is formed that leads to the absorption of lower&#8208;energy light. The excited state formed by this light absorption subsequently excites f&#8208;electrons of Er3+ or Yb3+ ions, and the relaxation of these f&#8208;electrons results in near&#8208;infrared photoluminescence. This may open a new chapter in the application of perovskites for infrared detection and human sensing.

      <dc:description>Protein lipoylation is a post&#8208;translational modification of emerging importance in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. However, labeling and large&#8208;scale profiling of protein lipoylation remain challenging. Here, we report the development of iLCL (iodoacetamide&#8208;assisted lipoate&#8208;cyclooctyne ligation), a chemoselective reaction that enables chemical tagging of protein lipoylation. We demonstrate that the cyclic disulfide of lipoamide but not linear disulfides can selectively react with iodoacetamide to produce sulfenic acid, which can be conjugated with cyclooctyne probes. iLCL enables tagging of lipoylated proteins for gel&#8208;based detection and cellular imaging. Furthermore, we apply iLCL for proteomic profiling of lipoylated proteins in both bacteria and mammalian cells. In addition to all of the eight known lipoylated proteins, we identified seven candidates for novel lipoylated proteins.

      <title>A Face&#8208;to&#8208;Face Orchestration of Quasiplanar Donor and Acceptor Enables Highly Efficient Intramolecular Exciplex Fluorescence</title>
      <dc:description>Intramolecular t hrough&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer (TSCT) excited state has been exploited for developing thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters, whereas the tuning of excited state dynamics via conformational engineering remains sparse. Herein we designed a series of TSCT emitters with precisely controlled alignment of the donor and acceptor segments. With increasing intramolecular &#960; &#8208; &#960; interactions, the radiative decay rate of the lowest singlet excited state (S  1  ) progressively increased together with a suppression of nonradiative decay, leading to significantly enhanced photoluminescence quantum yields up to 0.99 in doped thin films. High&#8208;efficiency electroluminescence device with maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23.96% has been achieved which maintains at &gt;20% at the brightness of 1000 cd m  &#8208;2  . This work sheds light on the importance of conformation control for achieving high&#8208;efficiency intramolecular exciplex emitters.</dc:description>

Herein we designed a series of TSCT emitters with precisely controlled alignment of the donor and acceptor segments. With increasing intramolecular &#960; &#8208; &#960; interactions, the radiative decay rate of the lowest singlet excited state (S  1  ) progressively increased together with a suppression of nonradiative decay, leading to significantly enhanced photoluminescence quantum yields up to 0.99 in doped thin films. High&#8208;efficiency electroluminescence device with maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23.96% has been achieved which maintains at &amp;gt;20% at the brightness of 1000 cd m  &#8208;2  . This work sheds light on the importance of conformation control for achieving high&#8208;efficiency intramolecular exciplex emitters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Role of pyridinic nitrogen in the mechanism of the oxygen reduction reaction on carbon electrocatalysts</title>
      <dc:description>The introduction of pyridinic nitrogen (pyri&#8208;N) into carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction is considered to create new active sites. Herein, the role of pyri&#8208;N in such catalysts was investigated from a mechanistic viewpoint using carbon black (CB)&#8208;supported pyri&#8208;N&#8208;containing molecules as model catalysts, and the highest activity was observed for 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline/CB. X&#8208;ray photoemission spectroscopy showed that in acidic electrolytes, both pyri&#8208;N atoms of 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline could be protonated to form pyridinium ions (pyri&#8208;NH  +  ). In O  2  &#8208;saturated electrolytes, one of the pyri&#8208;NH  +  species was reduced to pyri&#8208;NH upon the application of a potential, whereas no such reduction was observed in N  2  &#8208;saturated electrolytes. This behavior was ascribed to the electrochemical reduction of pyri&#8208;NH  +  occurring simultaneously with the thermal adsorption of O  2  , as supported by density functional theory calculations. Moreover, according to these calculations, the coupled reduction was promoted by hydrophobic environments.</dc:description>

      <title>Crystallization Kinetics Modulation of FASnI3 Films with Pre&#8208;nucleation Clusters for Efficient Lead&#8208;free Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>Tin halide perovskites are rising as promising materials for lead&#8208;free perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the crystallization rate of tin halide perovskites is much faster than the lead&#8208;based analogs, leading to more rampant trap states and much lower power conversion efficiencies. Here, we disclose a key finding to modulate the crystallization kinetics of FASnI  3  (FA: formamidinium) through a non&#8208;classical nucleation mechanism based on pre&#8208;nucleation clusters (PNCs). By introducing piperazine dihydriodide to tune the colloidal chemistry of the FASnI  3  perovskite precursor solution, stable clusters could be readily formed in the solution before nucleation. These pre&#8208;nucleation clusters act as intermediate phase and thus can reduce the energy barrier for the perovskite nucleation. The precursor solution enriched with such intermediate PNCs could be readily converted to a high&#8208;quality perovskite film with a much lower defect density. This PNCs&#8208;based method has led to a conspicuous photovoltaic performance improvement for FASnI  3  &#8208;based PSCs, delivering an impressive efficiency of 11.39% plus improved stability.</dc:description>

      <title>Conformational Modulation of Iduronic Acid&#8208;Containing Sulfated Glycosaminoglycans by a Polynuclear Platinum Compound. Implications for Development of Antimetastatic Platinum Drugs.</title>
      <dc:description>1  H NMR spectroscopic studies on the 1:1 adduct of the pentasaccharide Fondaparinux (FPX) and the substitution&#8208;inert polynuclear platinum complex TriplatinNC show significant modulation of geometry around the glycosidic linkages of the FPX constituent monosaccharides. FPX is a valid model for the highly sulfated cell signalling molecule heparan sulfate (HS). The conformational ratio of the  1  C  4  :  2  S  0  forms of the FPX residue IdoA(2S) is altered from &#8776; 35:65 (free FPX) to &#8776; 75:25 in the adduct; the first demonstration of a small molecule affecting conformational changes on a HS oligosaccharide. Functional consequences of such binding are suggested to be inhibition of HS cleavage in MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. We further describe inhibition of metastasis by TriplatinNC in the TNBC 4T1 syngeneic tumour model. Our work provides insight into a novel approach for design of platinum drugs (and coordination compounds in general) with intrinsic anti&#8208;metastatic potential.</dc:description>

      <title>Heterostructure of Ru2P/WO3/NPC Synergistically Promotes H2O Dissociation for Improved Hydrogen Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>Facilitating the dissociation of water and desorption of hydrogen are both crucial challenges for improving the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media. Herein, we report the synthesis of heterostructure of Ru2P/WO3@NPC (N, P co&#8208;doped carbon) by a simple hydrothermal reaction using ruthenium and tungsten salts as precursors, followed by pyrolyzing under an Ar atmosphere. The Ru2P/WO3@NPC electrocatalyst exhibits an outstanding HER activity with an overpotential of 15 mV at a current density of 10 mA&#183;cm&#8208;2 and excellent durability in a 1.0 M KOH solution, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C and most reported electrocatalysts. Experimental results combined with density functional theory calculations reveal that the electron density redistribution in Ru2P/WO3@NPC is achieved by electron transfer from NPC to Ru2P/WO3 and from Ru2P to WO3, which directly promotes the dissociation of water on W sites in WO3 and desorption of hydrogen on Ru sites in Ru2P.</dc:description>

      <title>A glass&#8208;ceramic with accelerated surface reconstruction toward the efficient oxygen evolution reaction</title>
      <dc:description>The effective non&#8208;precious metal catalysts toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are highly desirable for electrochemical water splitting. The amorphous electrocatalysts are highly potential due to the increased exposure of active sites, while the crystalline counterparts exhibit the superiority of electron transport to active sites. To organically integrate these two components, here we prepare a novel glass&#8208;ceramic (Ni  1.5  Sn@triMPO  4  ) by embedding crystalline Ni  1.5  Sn nanoparticles into amorphous trimetallic phosphate (triMPO  4  ) matrix. This unique crystalline&#8208;amorphous nanostructure synergistically accelerates the surface reconstruction to active Ni(Fe)OOH, due to the low vacancy formation energy of Sn in glass&#8208;ceramic and high adsorption energy of PO  4  3&#8208;  at the V  O  sites. Compared to control samples, this dual&#8208;phase glass&#8208;ceramic after surface reconstruction exhibits a remarkably lowered overpotential and boosted OER kinetics, rivaling most of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. Theoretical calculations reveal that the residual PO  4  3&#8208;  and the V  O  sites induce electron depletion of adjacent Ni atoms and shift the d band center much closer to the Fermi level. Such redistribution of electron states optimizes the adsorption of OH* and OOH* intermediates on metal oxyhydroxides and promotes the OER activity. This study proves the structural superiority of glass&#8208;ceramics in boosting surface reconstruction and provides new insights into design of advanced electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

      <title>Insights into Redox Chemistry of Organosulfides Towards Stable Molecule Design in Nonaqueous Energy Storage Systems</title>
      <dc:description>Nonaqueous redox flow batteries (RFBs) have great potential to achieve high&#8208;energy storage systems. However, their advancement has long been limited by low solubility and poor stability of active materials. Here we demonstrate organosulfides as a new&#8208;type model material system to explore the rational design of redox&#8208;active molecules in nonaqueous systems. The designed tetraethylthiuram disulfide (TETD) molecule shows high solubility in various common organic solvents and achieves a high reversible capacity of ~50 Ah L  &#8208;1  at a high concentration of 1 M. More importantly, the resonance structures in the reduced product endow the molecule with high electrochemical stability in different organic electrolytes. The underlying mechanism in redox chemistry of organodisulfides involving the cleavage and reformation of disulfide bonds is revealed by systematic material/structural characterizations. This study provides a new perspective of promising molecule designs to tackle the fundamental challenges in the development of redox&#8208;active materials for high&#8208;performance nonaqueous RFBs.</dc:description>

      <title>Analogous mixed matrix membranes with self&#8208;assembled interface pathways</title>
      <dc:description>The implementation of mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) for sub&#8208;angstrom scale gas separations remains a grand challenge. Meanwhile, the elucidation of structure and formation mechanism of elusive interface pathways is urgently needed yet largely unmet. Herein, a series of analogous mixed matrix membrane (AMMMs) were constructed via molecular&#8208;level hybridization by utilizing reactive ionic liquid (RIL) as continuous phase and graphene quantum dot (GQD) as nanofiller for sub&#8208;angstrom scale ethylene/ethane (0.416 nm / 0.443 nm) separation. With a small number of GQDs (3.5 wt.%) embedded in GQD/RIL AMMMs, ethylene permeability soared by 3.1 times, and ethylene/ethane selectivity simultaneously boosted by nearly 60% and reached up to 99.5, which outperformed most previously reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes. Importantly, the interfacial pathway structure was visualized and their self&#8208;assembly mechanism was revealed, where the non&#8208;covalent interactions between RIL and GQDs induced the local arrangement of IL chains to self&#8208;assemble into plenty of compact and superfast interfacial pathways, contributing to the combination of superhigh permeability and selectivity. This study shed light on the rational design of interface pathways and sustainable prosperity of MMMs for energy&#8208;intensive gas molecule separations.</dc:description>

      <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Solvent&#8208;Free Chiral Organic &#960;&#8208;liquids</title>
      <dc:description>The solvent&#8208;free organic &#960;&#8208;liquids have been attracting increasing attentions due to the inherent optoelectronic properties accompanied by the advantages of non&#8208;volatility and high processability. Here we reported a series of naphthalene derivatives substituted with chiral branched alkyl chains, which present as liquids ( Nap1&#8208;3 ) or solid ( Nap4 ) at room temperature depending on the substitution positions. Circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) were only observed for enantiomeric Nap2 (2,3&#8208;substituted) liquid. It is suggested that the chiral aggregation in the &#960;&#8208;liquid leads to the CD signal and the chiral excimer resulting in the CPL performance. When achiral anthracene or pyrene was dissolved in Nap2, the &#960;&#8208;liquid could serve as chirality and energy transfer media that both CD and CPL emerged from the achiral anthracene. A CPL dissymmetry factor (|glum|) of anthracene reached to 5.2&#215;10&#8208;2 when dissolved in chiral Nap2 liquid, which is nearly two orders of magnitude higher than that of the pure Nap2 &#960;&#8208;liquid. Combined the experimental and theoretical studies, a fundamental understanding of the origin of the chiroptical properties in organic &#960;&#8208;liquid was provided and an efficient media for developing soft chiral materials was demonstrated.</dc:description>

      <title>Stereoselective Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Vinylcyclopropanation via Generation of a Sulfur&#8208;Substituted Vinyl Carbene Equivalent</title>
      <dc:description>A stereoselective gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed vinylcyclopropanation of alkenes has been developed. A gold&#8208;coordinated cationic vinyl carbene species, readily generated via a rearrangement of the ethylenedithioacetal of propargyl aldehyde, reacts with a wide range of alkenes to afford thio&#8208;substituted vinylcyclopropanes. The gold&#8208;catalyzed vinyl cyclopropanation proceeds under mild conditions at room temperature and is generally selective for the formation of  cis  &#8208;substituted cyclopropanes. The reaction allows the formal introduction of a &#8216;naked&#8217; vinyl carbene, by subsequent chemoselective hydrodesulfurisation of the ethylenedithio&#8208;bridge.

      <title>&#945;&#8208;SnF2: A UV Birefringent Material with Large Birefringence and Easy Crystal Growth</title>
      <dc:description>Simple binary fluoride &#945;&#8208;SnF  2  is shown to be an excellent birefringent material with outstanding birefringence (0.177 at 546 nm), 14 times larger than that of MgF  2  . Furthermore, it exhibits a shorter UV cutoff edge and easy crystal growth at ambient temperature compared to YVO  4  and TiO  2  . A novel theoretical calculation mode was established to analyze the stereochemical activity lone pair (SCALP) contribution to birefringence (SCB) based on the SCALP&#8217;s strength and arrangement, and it can be found that the large birefringence of &#945;&#8208;SnF  2  mainly benefits from well&#8208;aligned [SnF  5  ] polyhedra with the strong SCALP. The exploration of &#945;&#8208;SnF  2  birefringent crystal points out the direction of the future search for excellent birefringent materials.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Simple binary fluoride &#945;&#8208;SnF  2  is shown to be an excellent birefringent material with outstanding birefringence (0.177 at 546 nm), 14 times larger than that of MgF  2  . Furthermore, it exhibits a shorter UV cutoff edge and easy crystal growth at ambient temperature compared to YVO  4  and TiO  2  . A novel theoretical calculation mode was established to analyze the stereochemical activity lone pair (SCALP) contribution to birefringence (SCB) based on the SCALP&#8217;s strength and arrangement, and it can be found that the large birefringence of &#945;&#8208;SnF  2  mainly benefits from well&#8208;aligned [SnF  5  ] polyhedra with the strong SCALP. The exploration of &#945;&#8208;SnF  2  birefringent crystal points out the direction of the future search for excellent birefringent materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Strategies of mitigating dissolution of solid electrolyte interphases in sodium&#8208;ion batteries</title>
      <dc:description>With emerging interest in sodium&#8208;ion battery (SIB) technology due to its cost effectiveness and high earth abundance of sodium, the search for an optimised SIB&#160;system becomes more and more crucial.&#160;It is well known that the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) at the anode in Na&#8208;based systems is a challenge due to the higher solubility of the SEI components compared to in the lithium&#8208;ion battery case. Our knowledge about the formation and dissolution of the SEI in SIBs is so far based on limited experimental data. The aim of the present research is therefore to enhance the understanding of the behaviour of the SEI in SIBs and shed more light on the influence of the electrolyte chemistry on the dissolution of the SEI. By conducting electrochemical tests including extended open circuit pauses, we study the SEI dissolution in different time domains. With this, it is possible to determine the extent of self&#8208;discharge due to SEI dissolution during a specific time. Instead of using a conventional separator, &#946;&#8208;alumina is employed as a Na&#8208;conductive membrane to avoid crosstalk between the working electrode and Na&#8208;metal counter electrode. The SEI composition is monitored using synchrotron&#8208;based soft X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (SOXPES). The electrochemical and XPS results show that the SEIs formed in the studied electrolyte systems have different stabilities. The relative capacity loss after a 50&#8208;hour pause in the tested electrolyte systems can be up to 30%. Among three carbonate&#8208;based solvent systems, NaPF  6  in ethylene carbonate: diethyl carbonate&#160;exhibits the most stable SEI.&#160;The addition of electrolyte additives improves the SEI stability in PC. The electrolyte is saturated with typical SEI species, NaF and Na  2  CO  3  , in order to oppose the dissolution of the SEI. Furthermore, the solubilities of the latter additives in the different solvent systems are determined by inductively coupled plasma &#8211; optical emission spectrometry.</dc:description>

      <title>Fe&#8208;O Clusters Anchored on Nodes of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Direct Methane Oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>Direct methane oxidation into value&#8208;added organic oxygenates with high productivity under mild condition remains a great challenge. In this work, we show Fe&#8208;O clusters on nodes of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with tunable electronic state for direct methane oxidation into C1 organic oxygenates at 50&#176;C. The Fe&#8208;O clusters are grafted onto inorganic Zr6  nodes of UiO&#8208;66 (UiO stands for University of Oslo), while the organic terephthalic acid (H2BDC) ligands of UiO&#8208;66 are partially substituted with monocarboxylic modulators of acetic acid (AA) or trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Experiments and theoretical calculation disclose that the TFA group coordinated with Zr6  node of UiO&#8208;66 enhances the oxidation state of adjacent Fe&#8208;O cluster due to its electron&#8208;withdrawing ability, promotes the activation of C&#8208;H bond of methane and increases its selective conversion, thus leading to the extraordinarily high C1 oxygenate yield of 4799 &#956;mol gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 with 97.9% selectivity, ~8 times higher than those modulated with AA.</dc:description>

      <title>Inorganic&#8208;rich Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Advanced Lithium Metal Batteries in Carbonate Electrolytes</title>
      <dc:description>In carbonate electrolytes, the organic&#8208;inorganic solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed on the lithium (Li) metal anode surface is strongly bonded to Li and experiences the same volume change as Li, thus it undergoes continuous cracking/reformation during plating/stripping cycles. Here, an inorganic&#8208;rich SEI is designed on a Li metal surface to reduce its bonding energy with Li metal by dissolving 4 M concentrated LiNO  3  in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as an additive for a fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) based electrolyte. Due to the aggregate structure of NO  3  &#8208;  ions and its participation in the primary Li  +  solvation sheath, abundant Li  2  O, Li  3  N, and LiN  x  O  y  grains are formed in the resulting SEI, in addition to the uniform LiF distribution from the reduction of PF  6  &#8208;  ions. The inorganic&#8208;rich SEI&#8217;s weak bonding (high interface energy) to Li can effectively promote Li diffusion along the SEI/Li interface and prevent Li dendrite penetration into the SEI. As a result, our designed carbonate electrolyte enables a Li anode to achieve a high Li plating/stripping CE of 99.55% (1 mA cm  &#8208;2  , 1.0 mAh cm  &#8208;2  ) and the electrolyte also enables a Li||LiNi  0.8  Co  0.1  Mn  0.1  O  2  (NMC811) full cell (2.5 mAh cm&#8208;2) to retain 75% of its initial capacity after 200 cycles with an outstanding CE of 99.83%. The concentrated additive strategy presented here provides a drop&#8208;in practical solution to further optimize carbonate electrolytes for beyond Li&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

      <title>Boosted Hydrogen Evolution Kinetics over Particulate Lanthanum and Rhodium&#8208;Doped Strontium Titanate Photocatalysts Modified with Phosphonate Groups</title>
      <dc:description>Phosphonate groups loaded on the surface of the visible light responsive photocatalyst Ru&#8208;loaded La,Rh&#8208;doped SrTiO  3  (Ru/La,Rh:STO)  via  a silane coupling treatment enhance the photocatalytic activity of this material during the hydrogen evolution reaction. Surface modification with an alkylsilane phosphonate accelerates the supply of reactants to active sites and is much more effective at improving photocatalytic activity than the utilization of phosphate buffered electrolyte as a reaction solution. In contrast, the incorporation of amine, sulfonate, and propyl groups does not improve the activity of Ru/La,Rh:STO. The effects of these functional groups introduced  via  the silane coupling on the reaction kinetics of hydrogen evolution are evaluated separately from the oxidative reaction using electrochemical methods. It was also demonstrated that the present alkylsilane phosphonate modification increases photocatalytic activity even under a low photon flux. This study introduces a new approach to improving the reaction kinetics of particulate photocatalysts by actively accelerating the reactant mass transfer through the pre&#8208;anchored phosphonate groups as an alternative to the development of the photocatalyst material itself.</dc:description>

      <title>A Stable [4,3]Peri&#8208;acene Diradicaloid: Synthesis, Structure and Electronic Properties</title>
      <dc:description>Synthesis of peri&#8208;fused two or more rows of acenes (peri&#8208;acenes) is challenging due to their intrinsic open&#8208;shell diradical character. Herein, we report the isolation of a derivative (  4  ) of hitherto the largest peri&#8208;acene molecule, namely [4,3]peri&#8208;acene, in a crystal form. The parent [4,3]peri&#8208;acene containing three rows of tetracene has a large diradical character (y  0  = 94.8%) originated from aromatic stabilization. Due to kinetic blocking,  4  showed reasonable stability with a half&#8208;life time of ~157 hours under ambient conditions. Its structure was determined by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, and bond length analysis revealed eight localized Clar&#8217;s sextets.  4  exhibited open&#8208;shell singlet ground state with a narrow electrochemical energy gap (1.13 eV) and a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#8208;0.57 kcal/mol from SQUID measurement). Its electronic properties are compared with previously reported peri&#8208;tetracene and teranthene derivatives.</dc:description>

      <title>Reaction Acceleration at Solid/Solution Interfaces: Katritzky Reaction Catalyzed by Glass Particles</title>
      <dc:description>The Katritzky reaction in bulk solution at room temperature is accelerated significantly by the surface of a glass container compared to a plastic container. Remarkably, the reaction rate is increased by more than two orders of magnitude upon the addition of glass particles with the rate increasing linearly with increasing amounts of glass. A similar phenomenon is observed when glass particles are added to levitated droplets, where large acceleration factors are seen. Evidence shows that glass acts as a catalyst: it participates as a base in the deprotonation step and is recovered unchanged from the reaction mixture. Reaction acceleration at two separate interfaces is recognized in this study: (i) air/solution phase acceleration, as is well known in microdroplets; (ii) solid/solution phase, where such acceleration appears to be a new phenomenon.</dc:description>

      <title>Formic Acid Electro&#8208;synthesis by Concurrent Cathodic CO2 Reduction and Anodic CH3OH Oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>Electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide into energy carrying compounds or value&#8208;added chemicals is of great significance for diminishing the greenhouse effect and the efficient utilization of carbon dioxide emissions, which, however, suffers from the kinetic&#8208;sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and its less value&#8208;added production of O  2  . Herein, we report a general strategy for efficient formic acid synthesis by concurrent cathodic    CO  2  reduction and anodic partial methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), using mesoporous SnO  2  grown on carbon cloth (mSnO  2  /CC) and CuO nanosheets grown on copper foam (CuONS/CF) as cathodic and anodic catalysts, respectively. Anodic CuONS/CF enables an extremely lowered potential of 1.47 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) to obtain 100 mA cm  &#8208;2  , featuring a significantly enhanced electro&#8208;activity in comparison to OER. Meanwhile, the cathodic mSnO  2  /CC shows a rather high Faraday efficiency of 81% at 0.7 V vs RHE for formic acid production from CO  2  . Moreover, the established electrolyzer equipped with CuONS/CF at the anode and mSnO  2  /CC at the cathode requires a considerably low cell voltage of 0.93 V at 10 mA cm  &#8722;2  for formic acid production at both sides.</dc:description>

      <title>High&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells with imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid for surface passivation and charge transport</title>
      <dc:description>Surface defects have been a key constraint for perovskite photovoltaics. Herein, 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;3&#8208;imidazolium hexafluorophosphate (DMIMPF  6  ) ionic liquid (IL) is adopted to passivate the perovskite surface and also reduce the energy barrier between the perovskite and hole transport layer. Theoretical simulation and experimental results demonstrate that Pb&#8208;cluster and Pb&#8208;I antisite defects can be effectively passivated by [DMIM]  +  bonding with the Pb  2+  on the perovskite surface, leading to significantly suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination. As a result, the solar cell efficiency is increased to 23.25% from 21.09% for the control device, mostly due to improvement of open&#8208;circuit voltage. Furthermore, the DMIMPF  6  &#8208;treated perovskite device shows better long term environmental stability because the DMIMPF  6  layer can efficiently block moisture permeation due to its hydrophobic nature. This work provides firm support to the understanding of the passivation effect and further promotes the development of surface engineering for enhancing the performance of perovskite photovoltaics.</dc:description>

Theoretical simulation and experimental results demonstrate that Pb&#8208;cluster and Pb&#8208;I antisite defects can be effectively passivated by [DMIM]  +  bonding with the Pb  2+  on the perovskite surface, leading to significantly suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination. As a result, the solar cell efficiency is increased to 23.25% from 21.09% for the control device, mostly due to improvement of open&#8208;circuit voltage. Furthermore, the DMIMPF  6  &#8208;treated perovskite device shows better long term environmental stability because the DMIMPF  6  layer can efficiently block moisture permeation due to its hydrophobic nature. This work provides firm support to the understanding of the passivation effect and further promotes the development of surface engineering for enhancing the performance of perovskite photovoltaics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>An enantioselective e&#8208;nose: An array of nanoporous homochiral MOF films for stereospecific sensing of chiral odors</title>
      <dc:description>Chirality is essential in nature and often pivotal for biological information transfer, e.g. via odor messenger molecules. While the human nose can distinguish the enantiomers of many chiral odors, the technical realization by an artificial sensor or an electronic nose, e&#8208;nose, remains a challenge. Here, we present an array of six sensors coated with nanoporous metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) films of different homochiral and achiral structures, working as an enantioselective e&#8208;nose. While the achiral&#8208;MOF&#8208;film sensors show identical responses for both isomers of one chiral odor molecule, the responses of the homochiral MOF films differ for different enantiomers. By machine learning algorithms, the combined array data allow the stereoselective identification of all compounds, here tested for 5 pairs of chiral odor molecules. We foresee the chiral&#8208;MOF&#8208;e&#8208;nose, able to enantioselectively detect and discriminated chiral odors, to be a powerful approach towards advanced odor sensing.</dc:description>

(EA&#8208;BPS) Construct Enhances the Lethality of Reactive Oxygen Species in Hypoxic Tumor&#8208;Targeted Photodynamic Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>Despite being a clinically approved intervention for cancer, photodynamic therapy (PDT) still suffers from limitations. Prime among these is a therapeutic response that is mostly oxygen dependent. This limits the utility of PDT in treating hypoxic tumors since lower levels of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated in regions of low oxygen tension.

We report here a new construct, EA&#8208;BPS, that contains both a brominated BODIPY photosensitizer (BPS) and an ethacrynic acid (EA) GST&#8208;pi inhibitor. Photoirradiation of EA&#8208;BPS induces a synergistic antitumor effect that results from the combination of ROS production and GST&#8208;pi inhibition. Relative to BPS alone, an enhanced cell&#8208;killing effect is seen under hypoxic conditions both&#160;in vitro&#160;and&#160;in vivo.

      <dc:description>Electrochemical aptamer&#8208;based (E&#8208;AB) sensors offer a powerful and general means for analyte detection in complex samples for various applications. Paper&#8208;based E&#8208;AB sensors could enable portable, low&#8208;cost, and rapid detection of a broad range of targets, but it has proven challenging to fabricate suitable three&#8208;electrode systems on paper.

We developed aptamer&#8208;modified PEDs that enable sensitive and specific detection of small molecules in minimally processed biosamples. The sensitivity and stability of the PEDs is comparable to E&#8208;AB sensors based on commercial gold electrodes.

      <dc:description>Controllably activating the bio&#8208;reactivity of metal complexes in living systems is challenging but highly desirable because it can minimize off&#8208;target bindings and improve spatiotemporal specificity. Herein we report a new bioorthogonal activation approach by employing Pd(II)&#8208;triggered transmetallation reactions to conditionally activate the bio&#8208;reactivity of NHC&#8208;Au(I)&#8208;phenylacetylide complexes (e.g.,  1a  ) in vitro and in vivo. A combination of  1  H NMR, LC&#8208;MS, DFT calculation and fluorescence screening assays reveals that  1a  displays a reasonable stability against biological thiols, but its phenylacetylide ligand can be efficiently transferred to Pd(II), leading to in situ formation of labile NHC&#8208;Au(I) species that is catalytically active inside living cells and zebrafish, and can meanwhile effectively suppress the activity of thioredoxin reductase, potently inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells and efficiently suppress angiogenesis in zebrafish models. Of note, by introducing RGD&#8208;functionalized Pd(II) inducers,  1a  is endowed with highly selective cytotoxicity towards cancer cells with minimal influence on the normal counterparts.</dc:description>

      <title>Multi&#8208;Modal Chiral Superstructures in Self&#8208;Assembled Anthracene&#8208;terminal Amino Acids with Predictable and Adjustable Chiroptical Activities and Color Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>Deep understanding of structure&#8208;property relationship between packing of chiral building units and their chiroptical behaviors would significantly facilitate the rational design and fabrication of the emerging chiroptical materials such as circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) emissive materials, which however still remains mysterious.

A series of coded amino acid methyl esters were conjugated to anthracene segments at N&#8208;terminus, which afforded 2  1  and 3  1  symmetry supramolecular tilt chirality in solid&#8208;states induced by H&#8208;bonds and aromatic interactions. Helical assemblies enabled diversified Cotton effects and CPL performances, which were in accordance with the tilted chirality between anthracene segments. Such correlation shows fine universality to all the eight applied building units that beyond exciton&#8208;chirality rule, whereby the chiroptical prediction of &#960;&#8208;conjugated chrial luminophors could be realized based on solid&#8208;state structures or computational dynamic simulation. This work shall greatly facilitate the rational design and prediction for the on&#8208;demand chiroptical self&#8208;assembled materials. Furthermore, electron&#8208;deficient molecules were accommodated into charge&#8208;transfer coassemblies, which enabled wide luminescent color transition as well as pure white&#8208;light emission. On top of charge&#8208;transfer complexation, facile manipulation of CPL emission colors and handedness were realized with retained dissymmetry g&#8208;factors.</dc:description>

On top of charge&#8208;transfer complexation, facile manipulation of CPL emission colors and handedness were realized with retained dissymmetry g&#8208;factors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Insights in the topology and the formation of a genuine pps bond: Experimental and computed electron densities in mono anionic trichlorine [Cl3]&#8722;</title>
      <dc:description>So far, several publications have discussed the bonding concepts in polyhalides on a theoretical basis. In particular, the trichlorine monoanion is of great interest because its structure should be symmetrical and show two equidistant Cl&#8722;Cl bonds. However, apart from matrix&#8208;isolation studies, only asymmetric trichlorine anions have been reported so far. Herein, the trichlorine monoanions in 2&#8208;chloroethyltrimethylammonium trichloride [NMe  3  EtCl][Cl  3  ],  1  , tetra&#173;methylammonium trichloride [NMe  4  ][Cl  3  ],  2  , and tetrapropylammo&#173;nium trichloride [N  n  Pr  4  ][Cl  3  ],  3  , are analysed. High&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray structures and experimental charge density analyses supported by periodic quantum&#8208;chemical calculations provide insight into the influence of the crystalline environment on the structure of these [Cl  3  ]  &#8722;  anions as well as in the progress of the bond formation between a dichlorine molecule and a Cl  &#8722;  anion.</dc:description>

      <title>Rational Synthesis of 1D Hyperbranched Heterostructures with Enhanced Optoelectronic Performance</title>
      <dc:description>One&#8208;dimensional (1D) hyperbranched heterostructures (HBHSs) with abundant interfaces are rendered with various interfacial phenomena and functionalities. However, the rational synthesis of 1D HBHSs with desired spatial architecture and specific interface remains a great challenge. Here, we report a seeded growth method for controlled synthesis of two extraordinary types of HBHSs, in which high&#8208;intensity of CdS branches selectively grow on 1D nanowire (NW) trunks with different growth behaviors. The composition of the HBHSs can be further tuned by combining with cation exchange method, which enriches the variety of the HBHSs. The optoelectronic devices based on a single HBHS were fabricated and exhibit a better photoresponse performance compared with that of a single NW trunk. This advance provides a strategy for the controlled synthesis HBHSs with complex morphology and offers a platform for exploring their applications for photo harvesting and conversion.</dc:description>

      <title>Theoretical, Solid&#8208;State and Solution Quantification of the Hydrogen Bond Enhanced Halogen Bond</title>
      <dc:description>Proximal noncovalent forces are commonplace in natural systems and understanding the consequences of their juxtaposition is critical. This paper experimentally quantifies for the first time a Hydrogen Bond enhanced Halogen Bond (HBeXB) without the complexities of protein structure or preorganization. An HBeXB is a halogen bond that has been strengthened when the halogen donor simultaneously accepts a hydrogen bond. Our theoretical studies suggest that electron&#8208;rich halogen bond donors are strengthened most by an adjacent hydrogen bond. Furthermore, stronger hydrogen bond donors enhance the halogen bond the most. X&#8208;ray crystal structures of halide complexes (X&#8212; = Br&#8212;, I&#8212;) reveal that HBeXBs produce shorter halogen bonds than non&#8208;hydrogen bond analogues. 19F NMR titrations with chloride highlight that the HBeXB analogue exhibits stronger binding. Together, these results form the foundation for future studies concerning hydrogen bonds and halogen bonds in close proximity.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis and two&#8208;dimensional chiral surface self&#8208;assembly of a novel &#960;&#8208;conjugated system with three&#8208;fold symmetry: Benzotri(7&#8208;azaindole)</title>
      <dc:description>The synthesis of a novel expanded &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, namely benzotri(7&#8208;azaindole), BTAI, is reported. Its C  3h  symmetry along with the integration of six complementary donor and acceptor N&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;N hydrogen bonds in the conjugated structure promote the 2D self&#8208;assembly on Au(111) over extended areas. Besides, a perfect commensurability with the gold lattice endows the physisorbed molecular film with a remarkable stability. The structural features of BTAI result in two levels of surface chirality: Firstly, the molecules become chiral upon adsorption on the surface. Then, due to the favorable N&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;N hydrogen bond&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly, along with the relative molecular rotation with respect to the substrate, supramolecular chirality manifests in two mirror enantiomorphous domains. Thus, the system undergoes spontaneous chiral resolution. LEED and STM assisted by theoretical simulations have been employed to characterize in detail these novel 2D conglomerates with relevant chiral properties for systems with C  3h  symmetry.</dc:description>

Its C  3h  symmetry along with the integration of six complementary donor and acceptor N&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;N hydrogen bonds in the conjugated structure promote the 2D self&#8208;assembly on Au(111) over extended areas. Besides, a perfect commensurability with the gold lattice endows the physisorbed molecular film with a remarkable stability. The structural features of BTAI result in two levels of surface chirality: Firstly, the molecules become chiral upon adsorption on the surface. Then, due to the favorable N&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;N hydrogen bond&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly, along with the relative molecular rotation with respect to the substrate, supramolecular chirality manifests in two mirror enantiomorphous domains. Thus, the system undergoes spontaneous chiral resolution. LEED and STM assisted by theoretical simulations have been employed to characterize in detail these novel 2D conglomerates with relevant chiral properties for systems with C  3h  symmetry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Giant Optical Anisotropy in the UV&#8208;Transparent 2D Nonlinear Optical Material Sc(IO3)2(NO3)</title>
      <dc:description>Birefringence is a fundamental optical property for linear and nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. Thus far, it has proved to be very difficult to engineer large birefringence in optical crystals functioning in the UV region. Herein, we report the first 2D rare&#8208;earth iodate&#8208;nitrate crystal Sc(IO3)2(NO3) (SINO), which is shown to exhibit giant optical anisotropy. Air&#8208;stable SINO possesses a short UV absorption edge (298 nm), a strong NLO response (4.0 times that of benchmark KH2PO4) for the nitrate family, and the largest birefringence (&#916;n&#160;= 0.348 at 546 nm) of inorganic oxide optical crystals. The unusually large birefringence and NLO response can be attributed to an optimized 2D layered structure, combined with highly polarizable and anisotropic building units [IO3]&#8722;&#160;and [NO3]&#8722;. These findings will facilitate development of UV linear and NLO materials with giant optical anisotropy, and promote their potential applications in optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

      <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Unbiased Methylene C(sp3)&#8208;H Borylation of Acyclic Amides</title>
      <dc:description>We herein report amide directed enantioselective &#946;&#8208;C(sp  3  )&#8208;H borylation of unbiased methylene C&#8208;H bonds of acyclic amides enabled by iridium catalysis for the first time. The key to the success of this transformation relies on the careful selection of the combination of iridium precursor and chiral bidentate boryl ligands. A variety of functional groups are well&#8208;tolerated, affording chiral &#946;&#8208;functionalized amides in good to excellent enantioselectivities. We also demonstrate the application of the current method by stereospecific conversion of C&#8208;B bond into other functionalities.</dc:description>
