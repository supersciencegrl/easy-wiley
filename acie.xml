         <title>Ligand&#8208;Enabled Nondirected and Regioselective Arylation of Internal Alkenes with Simple Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regioselective functionalization of internal alkenes has become a highly efficient approach for preparing stereochemically defined multi&#8208;substituted olefins. Unlike traditional methods that require directing groups, activating groups, or active chemical bonds (e.g., halide, pseudo halide, organometallic reagent, etc.), there remains a strong demand for nondirected and selective functionalization of unactivated alkenes with simple coupling partners, both in academic research or industrial applications. Herein, we report the development of a pyridone&#8208;oxazoline (Pyoox) type ligand that combines the features of both pyridone and pyridine&#8208;oxazoline in assisting Pd&#8208;catalyzed olefination. This ligand enables the activation of simple (hetero)arenes and internal alkenes within a single reaction system. A nondirected and regioselective arylation from simple raw materials has been achieved, providing a straightforward route to various trisubstituted olefins in moderate to excellent yields, with excellent regio&#8208;/stereocontrol. Experimental and computational studies on mechanisms offer insight into the distinctive properties and performance of this ligand&#8208;promoted catalysis. The synthetic utility of this method is further demonstrated by the simplified synthesis and late&#8208;stage diversification of bioactive molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving Electrocatalytic CO2&#160;Reduction&#160;over Iron Tetraphenylporphyrin&#160;with Triethanolamine as&#160;a&#160;CO2&#160;Shuttle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Delivering&#160;CO2&#160;molecules to catalyst sites is a vital step in&#160;the&#160;CO2&#160;reduction reaction (CO2RR). Achievements have been made to develop efficient catalysts, but few efforts have been dedicated to improving CO2&#160;delivering&#160;in solutions. Herein, we report on&#160;electrocatalytic&#160;CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion&#160;using&#160;Fe tetraphenylporphyrin&#160;(FeTPP)&#160;as a catalyst and&#160;triethanolamine&#160;as a CO2&#160;shuttle.&#160;Compared to ethanol,&#160;the electrocatalytic CO2RR current with triethanolamine increases by more than three times.&#160;We show that triethanolamine can effectively capture a CO2&#160;molecule to form a&#160;zwitterionic alkylcarbonate&#160;through the collaboration between its tripodal alcohol and amine units.&#160;This alkylcarbonate can release the bound CO2&#160;molecule for activation at the Fe site upon its interaction with FeTPP. In addition to shuttling CO2, alkylcarbonates&#160;can also provide protons to assist the C&#8211;O bond cleavage. Therefore, this work is significant to demonstrate a new strategy to improve electrocatalytic CO2RR by shuttling CO2.</dc:description>

         <title>Post&#8208;deposition Treatment of Sb2Se3 Enables Defect Passivation and Increased Carrier Transport Dimension for Efficient Solar Cell Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Post&#8208;deposition treatment in thin film preparation can compensate for the inability of directly deposited films by fundamentally altering the chemical, electrical, morphological and defect properties. However, as an emerging photovoltaic material, the synthesis of Sb2Se3 film has so far been unable to effectively adjust the carrier transport and defect properties, thereby hindering performance improvement. In this study, we report that P2O5 can serve as a post&#8208;deposition treatment material to modify the chemical and electrical properties of Sb2Se3 thin films. Through experimental analysis, we discover that P atoms from P2O5 can occupy the Se vacancy and convert the deep&#8208;level anti&#8208;site defect (SbSe) to a shallower defect (PSe), rendering efficient defect passivation. Simultaneously, P&#8208;doping induced lattice distortion closes the ribbon spacing of (Sb4Se6)n, promoting efficient carrier transport from one dimension to three dimensions. This structure reduces the restriction of carrier transport in low&#8208;dimensional materials, which suppresses the carrier non&#8208;radiative recombination and improves the carrier transport efficiency. As a result, we achieved a champion power conversion efficiency of 9.50% in thermal evaporation derived Sb2Se3 superstrate solar cells. This study provides a novel strategy and guidance for passivating deep&#8208;level defects and modifying the crystal structure of low&#8208;dimensional solar cell materials.</dc:description>

         <title>meta&#8208;Hydroxylation of Pyridines, Quinolines, and Isoquinolines Using Dearomatized Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The functionalization of C&#8208;H bonds in heterocycles holds considerable importance in chemical synthesis and drug discovery. Recently, the regioselective introduction of various functionalities at the meta&#8208;position of azines, utilizing readily accessible dearomatized intermediates, has emerged as a highly attractive approach. Along these lines, the meta&#8208;hydroxylation of azines is an appealing but challenging transformation due to the inherent electronic nature of these heterocycles. Herein, we report a meta&#8208;selective hydroxylation of pyridines, quinolines and isoquinolines through easily accessible oxazinoaza&#8208;arene intermediates. The nucleophilic C3&#8208;position of these dienamine&#8208;type intermediates engages in highly regioselective hydroxylation upon treatment with electrophilic peroxides.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Zn and MoS2 Tailored Co&#8208;N/C Environments Enabling Bifunctional ORR/OER Electrocatalysis for Advanced Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To better adapt lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries (LOBs) and overcome their sluggish oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER) kinetics, designing efficient bifunctional ORR/OER catalytic materials is essential. In this study, we successfully constructed a bifunctional ZnCo&#8208;N/C@MoS2 catalyst by tailoring the Co&#8208;N/C center with Zn incorporation and MoS2 encapsulation. Surprisingly, Zn atoms, which are typically considered to promote the Co atoms isolation, exhibit a promoting effect on the ORR performance of Co&#8208;N/C centers and enhance their stability under harsh conditions. Introducing MoS2 establishes Mo&#8208;N coupling centers, enhancing electron transfer and adjusting the charge density of Co active centers, thereby compensating OER activity limitation of ZnCo&#8208;N/C. In Li&#8208;O2 batteries, Zn and MoS2 synergistically optimize intermediate interactions and regulate LiO2 formation/decomposition, while Zn's environmental adaptability and MoS2's encapsulating protection jointly enhance operational stability. Results show that ZnCo&#8208;N/C@MoS2, serving as the oxygen electrode in Li&#8208;O2 batteries, achieves a low overpotential of 1.01 V, an ultra&#8208;high specific capacity of 25,026 mAh g&#8208;1, and a long cycle life of 298 cycles. This work achieves bifunctionality in single&#8208;atom catalysts through precise dual modulation of the catalytic environment, providing a novel strategy for the development of lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Polar Three&#8208;dimensional Organic&#8208;inorganic Hybrid Perovskite Realize Highly Sensitive Self&#8208;driven Ultraviolet Photodetection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) triggered by spontaneous polarization in polar organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) has brought unprecedented development opportunities for self&#8208;powered ultraviolet photodetection. However, the currently reported ultraviolet optoelectronic devices are dominated by low&#8208;dimensional hybrid perovskites, in which low carrier mobility limits the photoelectric conversion efficiency. Herein, we report for the first time a polar three&#8208;dimensional OIHPs, namely MHyPbBr3 (1, MHy = methylhydrazine), that achieves high&#8208;performance self&#8208;driven ultraviolet photodetection.  Benefitting from the large spontaneous polarization and excellent semiconductor attributes, 1 exhibits 0.33 V BPVE and  high carrier mobility lifetime product (&#181;&#964;) of 1.972 &#205; 10&#8208;3 cm&#8208;2 V&#8208;1 under ultraviolet illumination. Notably, such merits contribute to efficient self&#8208;driven photodetection, where responsivity (R) and detectivity (D*) reach up to 198 mA W&#8208;1 and 1.42 &#205; 1013 Jones, surpassing most reported ultraviolet photodetectors. Furthermore, based on the reversible phase transition of 1, we have achieved controllable ultraviolet photoelectric detection. This work will shed light on the fabrication of high&#8208;response self&#8208;driven ultraviolet optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

Benefitting from the large spontaneous polarization and excellent semiconductor attributes, 1 exhibits 0.33 V BPVE and  high carrier mobility lifetime product (&#181;&#964;) of 1.972 &#205; 10-3 cm-2 V-1 under ultraviolet illumination. Notably, such merits contribute to efficient self-driven photodetection, where responsivity (R) and detectivity (D*) reach up to 198 mA W-1 and 1.42 &#205; 1013 Jones, surpassing most reported ultraviolet photodetectors. Furthermore, based on the reversible phase transition of 1, we have achieved controllable ultraviolet photoelectric detection. This work will shed light on the fabrication of high-response self-driven ultraviolet optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosting Li&#8211;CO2  Battery Performance via High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Catalysts: Insights into Configurational Entropy Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8211;CO2 batteries have attracted considerable attention for their ability to combine CO2 fixation and conversion with high&#8208;density energy storage. However, sluggish kinetics of CO2 reduction and evolution reactions at cathodes lead to large overpotential and poor cyclic stability. To address this issue, it is critical to develop advanced cathode catalysts. High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs), a new class of catalysts, have exhibited exceptional catalytic activities in various electrochemical reactions. Nevertheless, the intrinsic relationship between mix configurational entropy (&#8710;Smix) and catalytic properties of HEAs remains unclear. Herein, we prepared a series of quinary FeCoNiCuRu alloys with different &#8710;Smix values supported on carbon nanofibers as cathode catalysts in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries. Experimental and computational results reveal a positive correlation between &#8710;Smix and catalytic activity, attributed to charge redistribution among elements with different electronegativities. The Li&#8211;CO2 battery using the alloy catalyst with the maximum &#8710;Smix value delivers the largest capacity of 6160 mAh g&#8208;1, the lowest charge potential plateau below 4.0 V, and remarkable cycling stability (550 cycles/5500 h), surpassing most reported Ru&#8208;based catalysts. Furthermore, fabrication of pouch cells with low noble metal loading demonstrates the practical potential of HEAs for Li&#8211;CO2 batteries. This work provides insights into high&#8208;entropy engineering for advanced electrocatalysts in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Universal Reagent for Mild and Stereospecific Nucleophilic Substitution of Alcohols with Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A user&#8208;friendly reagent for mild and general activation of alcohols towards bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) leveraging diverse nucleophiles, including primary and secondary amines is reported herein. The new ion&#8208;paired reagent discovery was based upon the putative zwitterionic betaine intermediate of the Mitsunobu reaction and enabled the one&#8208;step conversion of enantioenriched alcohols to valuable chiral C&#8211;X bonds (where X = N, C, S, O or halide). The described activating reagent has also been applied to a one&#8208;step methylation reaction using methanol and to an intermolecular amination/intramolecular cyclization sequence that generates heterocycles, such as tetrahydroisoquinolines. This work provides the first evidence by X&#8208;ray crystallography of a protonated betaine as intermediate in the Mitsunobu reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Perovskites for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photocatalytic conversion of Carbon dioxide (CO2) into valuable chemicals is one of the most promising approaches for addressing the CO2 emission problem. However, several issues still need to be resolved to increase the efficiency of photocatalytic reaction. Perovskites possess superior light absorption capacity, tunable band gap, high defect tolerance, and diverse dimensionality. Among them, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites are more stable under photocatalytic conditions and have an exciting excitonic characteristics compared to three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskites. 2D perovskites have unique physical and chemical properties, such as, high stability, polaron formation, quantum well structures, and high exciton binding energies, which remain underexplored for photocatalytic CO2 reduction (pCO2RR). Tuning of these properties is easier in 2D perovskites than 3D perovskites by varying the layer thickness and spacer cations. Therefore, 2D perovskites photocatalysts are emerging as promising materials for reducing CO2 into valuable products. This review discusses the classification and synthesis methods for 2D perovskites, the unique properties that make it favorable for photocatalysis, and recent advances in applying 2D perovskites for pCO2RR by monitoring the operational methodology. It also emphasizes potential for future developments in photocatalysis using 2D perovskites.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling the Essential Role of Consecutive Protonation Steps in Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction when Using Au Nanorods in a MOF</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process (PCET) plays a crucial role in both natural and artificial photosynthesis, including CO2 fixation chemistry. However, difficulties in capturing the transient intermediates generated during the protonation process impedes the clarification of the fundamental mechanism behind photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Herein, we report a general killing two birds with one stone strategy by spatially confining Au nanorods within a typical porphyrin MOF (Au@PCN&#8208;222). Interestingly, 2.4&#8208;fold increase in CH4/CO selectivity and 12&#8208;fold increase in CH4 production were observed after loading of Au nanorods, indicative of a strengthened protonation process in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction. More importantly, the plasmonic effect from Au nanorods simultaneously boosted the in&#8208;situ Raman signals of *CO and *CHO intermediates on the Au&#8208;O&#8208;Zr active site. The evident protonation process was further clarified in a control H/D kinetic isotope experiment. This work highlights the significance of successive protonation steps for boosting CH4 production in photocatalytic CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Ether&#8208;Embedded Covalent Organic Frameworks Enable Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into valuable solar fuels is a promising strategy for addressing energy crises and mitigating the greenhouse effect. However, the challenge of efficiently regulating photogenerated electrons to CO2 active sites remains a key hurdle for high&#8208;performance CO2 reduction. Herein, a embedded functional group, ether group is introdcuced into porphyrin&#8208;triazine COFs to regulate the transfer behavior of photogenerated electrons. The ether&#8208;embedded COFs (TOT&#8208;TAPP, BOD&#8208;TAPP and QOB&#8208;TAPP) demonstrates significantly faster charge transport and higher photoactivity compared with the corresponding non&#8208;ether&#8208;embedded counterpart COFs. The theoretical calculations and in situ characterizations reveal that the ether group could not only accelerate the separation of photogenerated charge carriers, but also lead to a more substantial accumulation of electrons at the CO2 adsorption region (C=N imine bond), thus greatly promoting the efficiency of CO2 photoreduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring One&#8208;dimensional Assemblies of Chiral Bowl&#8208;Shaped Molecules with Diverse Enantiomers and Polar Column Alignments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Symmetry is an important factor in material design. Generally, it is difficult to quantitively discuss symmetry&#8208;property relations. Two materials only with symmetry differences are requisite to verify whether polar or nonpolar chiral systems are advantageous for a specific property/phenomenon, such as chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity. However, it is difficult to selectively prepare materials having different symmetries without changing other physical properties. The current study successfully prepared seven exceptionally similar crystals with different symmetries in terms of polarity, chirality, and enantiomer alignments, which affords ideal materials for the abovementioned studies. Furthermore, we revealed a universal guiding principle on the self&#8208;assembly pattern of bowl&#8208;shaped molecules to predict the resultant assembled structures with the help of molecular dynamics simulations.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformal Reconstruction and Dual&#8208;Vacancy Engineering Breaks Kinetics Limitations for Energetic Aqueous Dual&#8208;Cation Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient aqueous energy storage with non&#8208;metallic ions is highly desired but challenged by achieving kinetically favorable surface/interface storage chemistry. Herein, by refining the surface proton environment, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with hydrogen&#8208;aluminum dual vacancies and 3D diffusion channels are demonstrated upon conformal surface reconstruction. An energetic NH4+/H+ dual&#8208;ion co&#8208;intercalation chemistry is enabled, leading to a remarkable gravimetric specific capacity of up to 604 mAh g&#8208;1 and long&#8208;cycle stability. Combining in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy and in&#8208;situ electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) techniques, we reveal and visualize the conformal reconstruction process and the reversible dual&#8208;cation storage mechanism. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation shows that the dual&#8208;vacancy coupling helps the dissolution of inert Al from LDH for enriching active sites. At the same time, the residual Al shows the pining effect on the [MnO6] octahedron to restrain the Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion. The manganese sites adjacent to Al vacancies promote the adsorption of NH4+/H+ and the H vacancies facilitate the adsorption of NH4+, responsible for an optimal dual&#8208;cation storage chemistry. This work demonstrates how the dual vacancies emerge to modulate the carrier migration and thereby the capacity, providing a viable solution of surface/interface optimization for efficient aqueous energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Localized Alkaline Microenvironments Enhanced upon Tip Effects for Efficient Antibacterial Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>he electrochemical disinfection mechanism primarily relies on a high&#8208;voltage pulsed electric field and electrocatalytic generation of highly oxidative radicals but suffers from shortcomings of either high voltages (dozens of kV) or significant gas supply. This study proposes an in&#8208;situ electrocatalytic sterilization strategy that forms localized alkaline microenvironments in neutral electrolytes under a constant current of &#8208;12 mA at a relatively lower voltage (&#8208;0.5 V vs. RHE). The nanowire cathode surface can effectively adsorb hydronium ions (H3O+) from the solution during H2 evolution, leading to a rapid increase in hydroxide ions (OH&#8208;) concentration in the surrounding solution. This leads to a high diffusion zone of OH&#8208;, creating a localized alkaline microenvironment. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) and finite element analysis (FEA) reveal that the nanowire&#8208;derived tip&#8208;enhanced effect significantly enhances OH&#8208; accumulation around the cathode, effectively inactivating Escherichia coli (E. coli) at 10&#8311; CFU/mL within 3 minutes at &#8208;0.5 V. The resulting increase in OH&#8208;&#160;concentration drives rapid sterilization by inhibiting bacterial ATP synthesis and inducing oxidative stress. This method can efficiently inactivate microorganisms in a short time, while having minimal impact on the overall pH of the environment, making it a safe and environmentally friendly approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Dry&#8208;Solid&#8208;Electrochemical Synthesis: A General Method for Large Scale Synthesis of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts with High Metal loadings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal Dry&#8208;solid&#8208;electrochemical synthesis (DSES) method was proposed to fabricate single atom catalysts with high metal loadings. A unique redox mechanism for DSES process is proposed: metal precursors on conductive supports are reduced to individual metal atoms via a homolytic cleavage of metal precursors by the attacking of electrons flowing through the dry solid phase.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with high metal loadings are highly desirable but still challenging for large scale synthesis. Here we report a new technique named as dry&#8208;solid&#8208;electrochemical synthesis (DSES) for a general large&#8208;scale synthesis of SACs with high metal loadings in an energy&#8208;conservation and environment&#8208;friendly way. With it, a series of pure carbon&#8208;supported metal SACs (Platinum up to 35.0&#8197;wt&#8201;%, Iridium 21.2&#8197;wt&#8201;%, Ruthenium 20.4&#8197;wt&#8201;% and Iron 17.6&#8197;wt&#8201;%) with high metal loadings were obtained. Particularly, a Pt SAC with Pt 23.9&#8197;wt&#8201;% and remarkable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance in fuel cells is synthesized on kilogram scale. Based on multiple control experiments, a unique redox mechanism for DSES process is proposed: metal precursors on conductive supports are reduced to metals via a homolytic cleavage of metal&#8208;halogen bonds by the attacking of electrons flowing through the dry solid phase. Such versatile technique paves a new economical and environment&#8208;friendly pathway for fabricating high&#8208;metal&#8208;loading SACs or atomic dispersion catalysts.

         <title>Aminopeptidase N&#8208;Activated Self&#8208;immolative Hydrogen Sulfide Donor for Inflammatory Response&#8208;Specific Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donor AlaCOS could undergo a self&#8208;immolative process once activated by aminopeptidase N, an inflammatory biomarker, to generate H2S via carbonyl sulfide (COS), showing potent capacity to reduce cellular oxidative stress and inflammatory response. By reprogramming macrophages from M1 to M2 phenotype, this compound could accelerate wound healing significantly.







Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) plays crucial inflammatory modulating roles, representing a promising candidate for anti&#8208;inflammatory therapies. However, current H2S delivery approaches lack sufficient specificity against inflammatory response. Herein, regarding the overexpressed aminopeptidase N (APN) at the inflammation sites, an APN&#8208;activated self&#8208;immolative carbonyl sulfide (COS)/H2S donor (AlaCOS) was developed for inflammatory response&#8208;specific H2S delivery. The compound showed sustained H2S generation upon APN activation in the presence of carbonic anhydrase (CA), and the responsiveness could be well regulated by modulating the amino acid sequence. Due to the inflammatory response&#8208;specific sustained H2S delivery, AlaCOS provided potent anti&#8208;inflammatory capability, which was further validated by RNA sequencing. In vivo experiments on a full&#8208;thickness cutaneous wound murine model also showed the strong promoting effect on wound healing, mainly due to the regulation of the inflammatory response by AlaCOS. By introducing a caged coumarin fluorophore to the molecular architecture, self&#8208;reporting fluorescence could be generated accompanied with APN&#8208;mediated COS/H2S release, which achieved the visualization of H2S delivery in vitro and in vivo. This work not only offers a useful tool for studying the bioactivity of H2S on inflammation, but also provides new insights for developing novel therapies to cope with inflammation&#8208;associated diseases.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Coordinated Single&#8208;Atom Nickel Catalysts Derived from Water&#8208;Induced Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Aerogel for Efficient Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Research on metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) aerogels is relatively scarce, primarily constrained by the limited availability of synthetic methods. Herein, a water&#8208;induced rapid conversion process of MOF powder to MOF aerogel is demonstrated, where the macroscopic transition is essentially due to the reassembly of microscopic constituent units and the rapid alteration of morphological structure. The derived catalyst possesses abundant holes left by the acid leaching process, leading to the high enrichment of O&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;atom Ni sites on the concomitant carbon edges. Consequently, such a catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, only requiring a low overpotential of 279 mV to drive the benchmark current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2. Density functional theory calculations further reveal the reduced OER energy barrier over the edge&#8208;enriched O&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;atom Ni sites, as compared with internal O&#8208;coordinated sites and traditional N&#8208;coordinated sites. This is primarily attributed to the optimization effect of distinctive O&#8208;coordinated structure and synergistic edge effect on the electronic structure of active Ni centers.</dc:description>

         <title>Soluble Covalent Organic Frameworks as Efficient Lithiophilic Modulator for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing polyethylene glycol as the side chains, two new COFs (CityU&#8208;28 and CityU&#8208;29) not only become soluble for the facile solution processing technique, but also can facilitate the lithium&#8208;ion migration in batteries, which can be utilized as artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase to protect lithium metal anode. Highly improved cycling performance of 5000&#8197;h cycling for symmetric cell and up to 78.9&#8201;% capacity retention after 1500 cycles for LiFePO4 full&#8208;cell are achieved.







Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are regarded as the potential alternative of lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to their ultrahigh theoretical specific capacity (3860&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1). However, severe instability and safety problems caused by the dendrite growth and inevitable side reactions have hindered the commercialization of LMBs. To solve them, in this contribution, a design strategy of soluble lithiophilic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is proposed. By introducing polyethylene glycol as the side chains, two COFs (CityU&#8208;28 and CityU&#8208;29) not only become soluble for the facile coating technique, but also can facilitate the lithium&#8208;ion migration in batteries. Furthermore, when coated on the lithium anode of LMB, both COFs can act as artificial solid electrolyte interphase to prevent dendrite growth thus enabling the long&#8208;term stability of the cells. Notably, the symmetric CityU&#8208;29@Li cell can work for more than 5000&#8197;h at a current density of 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an areal capacity of 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. A remarkable capacity retention of 78.9&#8201;% after 1500&#8197;cycles and a Coulombic efficiency of about 99.9&#8201;% at 1.0&#8197;C can also be realized in CityU&#8208;29@Li||LiFePO4 full cell. This work could provide a universal design strategy for soluble COFs and enlighten their application in diverse scenarios, especially energy&#8208;related fields.

&lt;p&gt;By introducing polyethylene glycol as the side chains, two new COFs (&lt;b&gt;CityU-28&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;CityU-29)&lt;/b&gt; not only become soluble for the facile solution processing technique, but also can facilitate the lithium-ion migration in batteries, which can be utilized as artificial solid-electrolyte interphase to protect lithium metal anode. Highly improved cycling performance of 5000&#8197;h cycling for symmetric cell and up to 78.9&#8201;% capacity retention after 1500 cycles for LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; full-cell are achieved.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are regarded as the potential alternative of lithium-ion batteries due to their ultrahigh theoretical specific capacity (3860&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). However, severe instability and safety problems caused by the dendrite growth and inevitable side reactions have hindered the commercialization of LMBs. To solve them, in this contribution, a design strategy of soluble lithiophilic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is proposed. By introducing polyethylene glycol as the side chains, two COFs (&lt;b&gt;CityU-28&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;CityU-29&lt;/b&gt;) not only become soluble for the facile coating technique, but also can facilitate the lithium-ion migration in batteries. Furthermore, when coated on the lithium anode of LMB, both COFs can act as artificial solid electrolyte interphase to prevent dendrite growth thus enabling the long-term stability of the cells. Notably, the symmetric CityU-29@Li cell can work for more than 5000&#8197;h at a current density of 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and an areal capacity of 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. A remarkable capacity retention of 78.9&#8201;% after 1500&#8197;cycles and a Coulombic efficiency of about 99.9&#8201;% at 1.0&#8197;C can also be realized in CityU-29@Li||LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; full cell.

         <title>Organic&#8208;Free Synthesis of High&#8208;Silica Zeolite Y with Aluminophosphate as the Aluminum Carrier</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aluminum Carrier for High&#8208;Silica Zeolite Synthesis. Inspired by the kinetical&#8208;controlled drug delivery, a unique approach based on the controlled aluminum&#8208;incorporation mechanism is proposed to synthesize the most siliceous zeolite Y under organic&#8208;free condition. The introduction of aluminophosphate as Al carrier regulates crystallization kinetics of zeolite Y, which exhibits an improved hydrothermal stability and catalytic performance in benchmark reaction.







Abstract
The wide application of zeolite Y in petrochemical industry is well&#8208;known as one of the milestones in zeolite chemistry and heterogeneous catalysis. However, the traditional organic&#8208;free synthesis typically produces (hydro)thermally unstable zeolite Y with Si/Al atomic ratio (SAR) less than 2.5. Inspired by drug delivery process in which active components are kinetically controlled released, we develop a unique approach based on the pre&#8208;synthesized aluminum carrier to prepare one of the most siliceous zeolite Y with SAR up to 3.44 without using organics. The crystalline or amorphous aluminophosphates serve as the ideal carrier for the controlled incorporation of Al into zeolite framework during zeolite Y crystallization. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the partial introduction of aluminophosphate as Al source would rationally regulate the crystallization kinetics, facilitating the formation of high&#8208;silica zeolite Y with random Al distribution. This approach enhances the hydrothermal stability and catalytic performance of zeolite Y in benchmark reaction.

         <title>Unconventional Interconnected High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Nanodendrites for Remarkably Efficient C&#8722;C Bond Cleavage toward Complete Ethanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unconventional PtIrRhCoFeNiCu high&#8208;entropy alloy nanodendrites are successfully designed and show excellent ethanol oxidation activity, long&#8208;term stability, resistance to CO poisoning and efficient C1 pathway. The combined effect of intrinsically active Pt, Fe/Co/Ni/Cu in synergy for OHads formation, and Ir/Rh for C&#8722;C bond scission serves to favor C1 pathway over sluggish C2 pathway.







Abstract
Developing ethanol oxidation electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity, durability, and resistance to CO poisoning remains a major challenge. In recent years, high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) with unique physical and chemical properties have garnered substantial attention. Herein, a class of HEA nanodendrites are designed by a simple wet&#8208;chemical method. The mass activity and specific activity of the septenary PtIrRhCoFeNiCu high&#8208;entropy alloy catalyst are 2.13&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1/1.05&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt+Ir+Rh&#8722;1 and 2.95&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which reach 5.76&#8208;/2.84&#8208;fold and 5.57&#8208;fold improvements relative to commercial Pt/C (0.37&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 and 0.53&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), respectively. Remarkably, after the i&#8208;t test of up to 100,000&#8201;s and the accelerated durability test of 1500&#8197;cycles, 81.22&#8201;% and 68.54&#8201;% of the initial mass activity are well retained, respectively. The lattice distortion&#8208;associated local tensile strain as demonstrated by increased Pt&#8722;Pt bond length enhances ethanol adsorption and reduces reaction barriers. Moreover, hysteresis diffusion effect induced by lattice distortion in the HEA nanodendrites contributes to their superb ethanol oxidation stability. In situ infrared absorption spectroscopy reveals that the three HEA nanodendrites mainly follow C1 pathway with C&#8722;C bond breaking to form CO followed by CO oxidation especially at a wide range of high potentials. Theoretical calculations reveal that among these HEAs, PtIrRhCoFeNiCu possesses the lowest energy barrier for C&#8722;C bond scission due to synergy among Pt/Ir/Rh and water dissociation due to synergy among Co/Fe/Ni/Cu. This work provides insights to design unique HEA nanostructures with extraordinary catalytic performances and selectivity compared to conventional nanoparticles.

         <title>Inhibiting Interfacial Electron Leakage via An Artificial Rectified Layer for Longevous Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes an artificial rectified layer with hydrophobic, zincophilic and insulating features to inhibit electron leakage and homogenize ion/electron fields at the electrolyte/Zn anode interface, preventing the Zn anode from side reactions but promoting its (002) oriented deposition at high utilization and efficiency.







Abstract
Dendrites and water&#8208;induced side reactions impose greatly challenge on the implementation of aqueous zinc ion batteries. To tackle these problems, an artificial rectified layer (ARL) with hydrophobic, zincophilic and insulating features was in situ synthesized on Zn surface rapidly to prevent the electron leakage from Zn anode to aqueous electrolyte, which is the underlying logic for uneven Zn deposition and parasitic side reactions. The ARL also displays a high Zn2+ transference number of 0.71 and can build fast Zn2+ transport channels to homogenize the interfacial ion flux and electric field according to the calculated work function and multi&#8208;physics phase simulation results. Therefore, the Zn anode with ARL shows preferred plating along with (002) crystal facet and an admirable Coulombic efficiency of 99.86&#8201;% over 3200 cycles. Zn symmetric cells can withstand large current density up to 40&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and operate stably at 44.2&#8201;% depth of discharge for 250&#8197;hours, surpassing most of published reports. The ARL also enables the Zn||MnO2 full batteries to circulate over 2600 cycles with a high&#8208;capacity retention of 80.1&#8201;% and low self&#8208;discharge at 1&#8197;A g&#8722;1. This work provides a different perspective to comprehend and design satisfactory solid electrolyte interphase for Zn metal anodes.

         <title>In situ Polymerization Induced Seed&#8208;Root Anchoring Structure for Enhancing Stability and Efficiency in Perovskite Solar Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enhance the stability of perovskite solar cells, we used thiol&#8208;functionalized particles as a &#8220;seed&#8221; for in situ polymerization of 2,2,3,4,4,4&#8208;hexafluorobutyl methacrylate as a &#8220;root&#8221; at the bottom of the perovskite layer. This design prevents void formation under high temperatures and vacuum, enhancing the operational stability of perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
The escape of organic cations over time from defective perovskite interface leads to non&#8208;stoichiometric terminals, significantly affecting the stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). How to stabilize the interface composition under environmental stress remains a grand challenge. To address this issue, we utilize thiol&#8208;functionalized particles as a &#8220;seed&#8221; and conduct in situ polymerization of 2,2,3,4,4,4&#8208;hexafluorobutyl methacrylate (HFMA) as a &#8220;root&#8221; at the bottom of the perovskite layer. In this process, the thiol group acts as the initiation site for the polymerization of HFMA, while the fluorine groups in HFMA firmly anchor the organic cations of the perovskite through multiple hydrogen bonds. This strategy resembles how seeds take root in soil to prevent soil erosion. This bionic seed&#8208;rooting structure effectively stabilizes the stoichiometry of the perovskite, thus suppressing the escape of organic cations. As a result, the perovskite films with seed&#8208;rooting structures exhibit enhanced stability under harsh vacuum thermal conditions (150&#8201;&#176;C, &lt;10&#8197;Pa). The resulting PCS achieves an efficiency of 25.64&#8201;% and a 22.4&#8197;cm2 module efficiency of 22.61&#8201;%.

     alt="In situ Polymerization Induced Seed-Root Anchoring Structure for Enhancing Stability and Efficiency in Perovskite Solar Modules"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enhance the stability of perovskite solar cells, we used thiol-functionalized particles as a &#8220;seed&#8221; for in situ polymerization of 2,2,3,4,4,4-hexafluorobutyl methacrylate as a &#8220;root&#8221; at the bottom of the perovskite layer. This design prevents void formation under high temperatures and vacuum, enhancing the operational stability of perovskite solar cells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The escape of organic cations over time from defective perovskite interface leads to non-stoichiometric terminals, significantly affecting the stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). How to stabilize the interface composition under environmental stress remains a grand challenge. To address this issue, we utilize thiol-functionalized particles as a &#8220;seed&#8221; and conduct in situ polymerization of 2,2,3,4,4,4-hexafluorobutyl methacrylate (HFMA) as a &#8220;root&#8221; at the bottom of the perovskite layer. In this process, the thiol group acts as the initiation site for the polymerization of HFMA, while the fluorine groups in HFMA firmly anchor the organic cations of the perovskite through multiple hydrogen bonds. This strategy resembles how seeds take root in soil to prevent soil erosion. This bionic seed-rooting structure effectively stabilizes the stoichiometry of the perovskite, thus suppressing the escape of organic cations. As a result, the perovskite films with seed-rooting structures exhibit enhanced stability under harsh vacuum thermal conditions (150&#8201;&#176;C, &amp;lt;10&#8197;Pa). The resulting PCS achieves an efficiency of 25.64&#8201;% and a 22.4&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; module efficiency of 22.61&#8201;%. After 1300&#8197;hours of 1-sun illumination at 85&#8201;% relative humidity and 65&#8201;&#176;C (ISOS&#8722;L-3 protocol), the perovskite solar module maintains 90&#8201;% of its initial efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Porous 3&#8201;d&#8208;4&#8201;f Coordination Clusters for Selective Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new families of high&#8208;nuclearity coordination clusters [M120RE96] (M = Co and Ni, PCC&#8208;216MR) and [Co144Gd156] (PCC&#8208;300CG) with porous structure, high stability in solution were successfully isolated, demonstrating a superior reactivity and selectivity in converting CO2 into CO under visible light.







Abstract
We report herein two families of porous coordination clusters (PCCs) with 216 nuclearity (M120RE96 or PCC&#8208;216MR) and 300 nuclearity (Co144Gd156 or PCC&#8208;300CG). For the first family M could be either nickel or cobalt, and RE = Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, and Gd; while the latter features the highest nuclearity of transition&#8208;rare earth metal clusters. Characterized by their cube&#8208;like, hollow structures, these clusters exhibit the ability to absorb N2 and CO2. Besides, these clusters can be dissolved in both aqueous and acetonitrile/methanol solutions, and capable of acting as homogeneous catalysts for converting CO2 to CO under visible light. The gadolinium analogues of these clusters all show turnover numbers over 10000 and turnover frequencies over 1&#8197;s&#8722;1. In particular, the nickel based bimetallic cluster (PCC&#8208;216NG) demonstrates nearly 100&#8201;% selectivity for the reduction product, which may open a new direction for the design and development of PCCs based catalysts.

         <title>Topological Supramolecular Complexation of Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra for Tunable Interconnected Hierarchical Microporosity in Amorphous Form</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of topological supramolecular complexation is proposed to generate frustrated packing for the feasible fabrication of hierarchical microporosity with broad tunability in amorphous form. Secondary building units with cuboctahedron and tetrahedron geometry are complexed through hydrogen bonding and coordination interaction while the mis&#8208;match of the two topologies disfavor the dense packing of the structural units, and extrinsic porosity can be obtained.







Abstract
The precise engineering of microporosity is challenging due to the interference at the sub&#8208;nm scale from unexpected structural flexibility and molecular packing. Herein, the concept of topological supramolecular complexation is proposed for the feasible fabrication of hierarchical microporosity with broad tunability in amorphous form. The 2.5&#8197;nm metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOP) are complexed with quadridentate ligands through hydrogen and coordination bonding while the mismatch between the MOPs&#8217; cuboctahedron and ligands&#8217; tetrahedron topology leads to frustrated packing with extrinsic microporosity. Amorphous supramolecular frameworks can be obtained that integrate the intrinsic microporosity of the MOPs with the extrinsic porosity from the frustrated packing. The topologies, sizes and flexibility of ligands as well as ligand/MOP ratios are systemically varied, and the pore size distribution can be precisely adjusted. The hierarchical structures ranging from molecular packing to the morphologies of meso&#8208;scale assemblies are probed using ultra&#8208;small, small&#8208; and wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, enabling the quantitative evaluation of the micropores interconnectivity for the understanding of gas permeation performance. Gas separation membranes with permselectivity surpassing the Robeson upper bound can be designed. The findings not only give insight into the microscopic mechanism of supramolecular frustrated packing from topological design, but also pave new avenues for the cost&#8208;effective fabrications of microporous frameworks.

         <title>A Highly Selective and Versatile Probe Platform for Visualization of Monoacylglycerol Lipase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) is a key enzyme in the endocannabinoid system. We developed a highly flexible and specific probe platform to visualize MAGL in several cell types such as neurons or primary human immune cells. These results demonstrate the potential of the probe platform to unravel the manifold (patho)physiological roles and functions of MAGL in the endocannabinoid system.







Abstract
Monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) is a key enzyme for signal termination in the endocannabinoid system (ECS). MAGL inhibition results in indirect activation of the cannabinoid receptors, which offers unique advantages for the treatment of, e.g., multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, and other neurological disorders. Molecular imaging techniques are valuable tools to overcome the current poor understanding of MAGL's distribution and role in patho&#8208; and physiological processes within ECS signaling. Herein, we report the design, synthesis, and validation of highly selective versatile fluorescent and click&#8208;chemistry probes for MAGL. Structure&#8208;based design combined with a reverse&#8208;design approach allowed the development of a structural unit that selectively and effectively recognizes MAGL while offering a versatile platform to attach different fluorophores and further reporter units. In this way, labeled probes with sub&#8208;nanomolar potency carrying diverse fluorescent dyes were obtained. Probe affinity and selectivity remained invariant to changes in the fluorophore subunit, showing the remarkable robustness of this platform in delivering tailor&#8208;made probes. Highly consistent inhibition across species supports pharmacological model translatability. Extensive profiling and validation in various cellular systems shows the ability of these highly potent and selective probes to elucidate the complex role of MAGL in ECS cellular signaling, inflammatory processes, and disease progression.

         <title>Reconfiguring Terminal Species of Bituminous Coal to Steer Hard Carbon toward High&#8208;Capacity and Fast Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The functional species on the edge/plane terminals of bituminous coal are finely reconfigured by nitri&#8208;oxidation treatment to construct hard carbon with expanded carbon interlayer spacing and plentiful ultramicropores/closed pores. A large specific capacity of 356&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 is achieved along with a high Coulombic efficiency of 88.1&#8201;% and excellent rate/cycling performance.







Abstract
Hard carbons derived from coal precursors have shown bright industrial prospect as the low cost anode materials of sodium&#8208;ion batteries. However, it is of extreme necessity yet challenge to regulate carbon microstructure toward superior sodium energy storage. In this study, we propose a powerful chemical reconfiguration tactic to steer hard carbons toward high&#8208;capacity and fast sodium storage. The functional species on the edge/plane terminals of bituminous coal are finely reconfigured by nitri&#8208;oxidation treatment for effectively inhibiting the reordering of carbon layers under high temperature, thereby creating rich ultramicropores/closed pores and expanded interlayer spacing. These structural merits enable the hard carbon to garner an enhanced capacity of 356&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 along with a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 88.1&#8201;% and long lifespan. More impressively, the sodium storage kinetics is substantially sped up with a large capacity of 215&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 retained at a high&#8208;rate of 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This work will afford a fresh methodology for precursor modulation to accelerate the real&#8208;world practice of hard carbons toward advanced sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Logic&#8208;Gated DNA Intelligent Nanorobots for Cellular Lysosome Interference and Enhanced Therapeutics</title>

Logic&#8208;gated intelligent DNA nanorobots are engineered for cascade responses to extra&#8208;/intra&#8208;cellular microenvironmental factors (K+ and H+), enabling targeted cargo delivery, lysosomal interference, and enhanced cancer therapy.







Abstract
Environment&#8208;recognizing DNA nanodevices have proven promising for cellular manipulation and disease treatment, whereas how to sequentially respond to different cellular microenvironments remains a challenge. To this end, here we elaborate a logic&#8208;gated intelligent DNA nanorobot (Gi&#8208;DR) for the cascade response to inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;cellular microenvironments, thereby achieving lysosome&#8208;targeted cargo delivery for subcellular interference and tumor treatment with enhanced efficacy. Utilizing G&#8208;quadruplexes to respond to high&#8208;level K+ in cancer cell surrounding, this Gi&#8208;DR nanorobot can activate an aptamer&#8208;based transmembrane DNA machine that delivers molecular payloads to cellular lysosome. Accordingly, the nanoassembly of Gi&#8208;DR is promoted by the folding of heterodimeric i&#8208;motifs in the acidic microenvironment. Such a design allows the extra&#8208;/intra&#8208;cellular behaviors of the Gi&#8208;DR nanorobot to be programmed by an YES&#8208;AND logic circuit, with environmental K+ and H+ as two inputs. As a consequence, DNA nanostrips are controllably formed in living cells, interfering with lysosomal function and thereby preventing cellular proliferation. Further, a therapeutic agent (i.e. ligand&#8208;drug conjugate) is delivered into target cancer cells for synergistic tumor treatment in vivo, exhibiting the super&#8208;enhanced cancer cell lethality and anti&#8208;tumor efficacy. It well illustrates that our designed logic&#8208;gated DNA nanorobot has broad application prospects in modulating cellular function and precision disease treatment.

         <title>Assisted Solubilization Strategy in Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD for Thermally and Mechanically Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An assisted solubilization strategy by employing supramolecular polymerization network of deep eutectic solvent has been innovatively developed in spiro&#8208;OMeTAD to dissolve LiTFSI without conventional acetonitrile and 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyridine. The molecular network inhibits Li+ ions migration and strengthens adhesion at perovskite/spiro&#8208;OMeTAD/electrode interface, thus simultaneously improving thermal and mechanical stabilities under severe conditions.







Abstract
The ions migration and de&#8208;doping reactions caused by conventional doping seriously jeopardizes the thermal stability of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) based on spiro&#8208;OMeTAD as hole transport layer (HTL), which poses a significant challenge for subsequent commercialization. To address these issues, a novel assisted solubilization strategy has been firstly developed using deep eutectic solvent (DES) synthesized from N&#8208;(cyanomethyl)acetamide (NCMA) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI). NCMA can form multiple strong interaction modes with LiTFSI through N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bonding and Li&#8722;O/Li&#8722;N coordination, which effectively inhibits Li+ ions migration at high temperature and increases solubility of LiTFSI in chlorobenzene without acetonitrile and 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyridine (tBP), fundamentally solving de&#8208;doping reaction. In addition, the molecular network with abundant functional groups in DES improves fracture energy of perovskite/spiro&#8208;OMeTAD interface and enhances interfacial adhesion via strong chelation with perovskite and Ag electrode. Consequently, benefiting from tBP removement and inhibited ions migration, the optimized PVSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.02&#8201;%, and the unencapsulated device retains over 90&#8201;% of initial PCE at 85&#8201;&#176;C, 40&#8201;% RH for 1200&#8197;h (ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;2 standard). This innovative assisted solubilization strategy represents a critical step toward improving device stability and accelerating the commercialization of PVSCs.

         <title>Putting Charge Transfer Degree as a Bridge Connecting Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy and Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy revealed that ZnO with various amounts of copper doping exhibit very high consistency in the photocatalytic activity and the &#961;CT for surface&#8208;absorbed reactant molecules. This study firstly demonstrated the effectiveness of SERS spectroscopy based on the CT enhancement mechanism in predicting the interfacial CT process in semiconductor photocatalytic C&#8722;C coupling model reactions.







Abstract
To date, few systematic approach has been established for predicting catalytic performance by analyzing the spectral information of molecules adsorbed on photocatalyst surfaces. Effective charge transfer (CT) between the semiconductor photocatalysts and surface&#8208;absorbed molecules is essential for enhancing catalytic activity and optimizing light energy utilization. This study aimed to validate the surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) based on the CT enhancement mechanism in investigating the CT process during semiconductor photocatalytic C&#8722;C coupling model reactions. A copper ion doping strategy was employed to simultaneously enhance the SERS effect and catalytic activity of zinc oxide (ZnO) derived from metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF). By analyzing molecular fingerprint SERS spectra, we calculated the degree of CT (&#961;CT), revealing that SERS enhancement is attributed to the CT mechanism. In situ SERS spectra confirmed a high correlation between the catalytic activity and &#961;CT of ZnO with varying copper ion doping levels. A range of photoelectric and spectroscopic tests validated the effectiveness of SERS in linking CT to photocatalytic performance, consistent with first&#8208;principles density functional theory (DFT) simulations. This finding is also validated in other semiconductor materials and catalytic reactions, demonstrating the broad applicability of &#961;CT for predicting and evaluating SERS and catalytic activity.

         <title>Oligomerized Electron Acceptors with Alkynyl Linkages to Suppress Electron&#8208;Photon Coupling for Low&#8208;Energy&#8208;Loss Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel series of alkynyl&#8208;linked oligomerized electron acceptors have been synthesized via Sonogashira coupling, achieving precise morphology control, reduced non&#8208;radiative losses, and high efficiencies up to 19.52% in ternary solar cells.







Abstract
A novel series of alkynyl&#8208;linked oligomerized electron acceptors have been synthesized via Sonogashira coupling. The alkynyl linkages can enhance molecular planarity and aggregation, suppress electron&#8208;phonon coupling, and reduce non&#8208;radiative losses. Binary organic solar cells (OSCs) achieved an efficiency of 17.90%, with a non&#8208;radiative loss of 0.185 eV, while ternary OSCs reached a remarkable efficiency of 19.52%. Oligomerized electron acceptors, featuring molecular weights akin to polymers and well&#8208;defined chemical structures, have emerged as promising candidates for organic solar cells (OSCs) due to their consistent batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch reproducibility and improved thermal stability. In this study, we developed a series of oligomerized electron acceptors incorporating alkynyl linkages via an efficient Sonogashira coupling reaction between alkyne&#8208;substituted Y&#8208;type precursors and multi&#8208;substituted iodobenzenes. This method produced monomeric (S&#8208;Alkyne&#8208;YF), dimeric (D&#8208;Alkyne&#8208;YF), and trimeric (T&#8208;Alkyne&#8208;YF) configurations, enabling systematic control over molecular size and substituent arms. The alkynyl linkages, characterized by high bond strength and planar geometry, enhanced molecular planarity and aggregation in films, thus facilitating precise control over morphology and phase separation in the photoactive layers. Notably, the inclusion of these linkages effectively suppressed electron&#8208;phonon coupling, resulting in reduced non&#8208;radiative energy losses and elevated photocarrier lifetime. OSCs based on PM6:T&#8208;Alkyne&#8208;YF achieved a power conversion efficiency of 17.90%, a low non&#8208;radiative energy loss of 0.185&#8197;eV, and an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.943&#8197;V.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel series of alkynyl-linked oligomerized electron acceptors have been synthesized via &lt;i&gt;Sonogashira&lt;/i&gt; coupling. The alkynyl linkages can enhance molecular planarity and aggregation, suppress electron-phonon coupling, and reduce non-radiative losses. Binary organic solar cells (OSCs) achieved an efficiency of 17.90%, with a non-radiative loss of 0.185 eV, while ternary OSCs reached a remarkable efficiency of 19.52%. Oligomerized electron acceptors, featuring molecular weights akin to polymers and well-defined chemical structures, have emerged as promising candidates for organic solar cells (OSCs) due to their consistent batch-to-batch reproducibility and improved thermal stability. In this study, we developed a series of oligomerized electron acceptors incorporating alkynyl linkages via an efficient &lt;i&gt;Sonogashira&lt;/i&gt; coupling reaction between alkyne-substituted Y-type precursors and multi-substituted iodobenzenes. This method produced monomeric (S-Alkyne-YF), dimeric (D-Alkyne-YF), and trimeric (T-Alkyne-YF) configurations, enabling systematic control over molecular size and substituent arms. The alkynyl linkages, characterized by high bond strength and planar geometry, enhanced molecular planarity and aggregation in films, thus facilitating precise control over morphology and phase separation in the photoactive layers. Notably, the inclusion of these linkages effectively suppressed electron-phonon coupling, resulting in reduced non-radiative energy losses and elevated photocarrier lifetime. OSCs based on PM6:T-Alkyne-YF achieved a power conversion efficiency of 17.90%, a low non-radiative energy loss of 0.185&#8197;eV, and an open-circuit voltage of 0.943&#8197;V. Furthermore, integrating T-Alkyne-YF into the D18:N3 blend yielded an exceptional PCE of 19.52%. These results underscore the potential of alkynyl-linked oligomerized acceptors in advancing highly efficient and stable OSCs, offering a viable pathway for reducing electron-phonon coupling and enhancing device performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The hollow&#8208;structured [In2S3&#8208;x/In2O3&#8208;x](OH)y S&#8208;Scheme heterojunction, featuring abundant surface hydroxyl groups and S/O dual vacancies, demonstrates exceptional long&#8208;term stability and outstanding H2 evolution performance at low temperature in photothermal&#8208;driven methanol/water reforming







Abstract
To enable highly efficient in situ hydrogen release from methanol/water reforming at lower temperature, the integration of solar&#8208;energy offers a promising approach to activate methanol/water and substantially lower the activation energy of this reaction. Herein, we present a novel dual&#8208;vacancy defective hollow heterostructure derived from Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks, featuring abundant surface hydroxyl groups and S/O vacancies, for photothermal&#8208;promoted methanol solution reforming into hydrogen. The [In2S3&#8208;x/In2O3&#8208;x](OH)y exhibits exceptional photothermal H2 evolution activity, achieving a production rate of 215.2 mmolgcat&#8722;1h&#8722;1, 16&#8208;fold higher than its thermocatalytic activity, with an apparent quantum efficiency of 66.8&#8201;% at 365&#8197;nm and solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency (STH) of 1.1&#8201;% under AM 1.5G simulated solar illumination, and excellent durability over 82&#8197;h, cumulating 2.61&#215;103 mmolgcat&#8722;1. The synergistic effects of dual&#8208;vacancies and the hollow heterostructure significantly enhance the photothermal effect, lowering the activation energy barrier for methanol/water, enabling H2 production at temperatures even as 80&#8201;&#176;C under non&#8208;alkaline conditions. Furthermore, the incorporated surface hydroxyl groups facilitate the generation of active surface hydroxyls from water, further driving activation and cleavage of C&#8722;H bonds in methanol, thereby markedly reducing the apparent reaction activation energy by 12.5&#8201;%. This work provides a new strategy for effective H2 production from aqueous methanol reforming under mild conditions, holding great promise for energy&#8208;demanding industrial applications.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermolecular H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking between 2,6&#8208;diaminoanthraquinone and 2,4,6&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol nanofibrous polymer expose consecutive electron delocalization route to fully access build&#8208;in ultralow&#8208;energy&#8208;barrier protophilic carbonyls for superior proton storage. A 5 e&#8722; high&#8208;kinetics H+&#8208;coupled mechanism gives the Zn&#8208;organic battery high capacity (359&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), large&#8208;current survivability (100&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and ultralong life (60,000&#8197;cycles).







Abstract
Protons (H+) with the smallest size and fastest redox kinetics are regarded as competitive charge carriers in the booming Zn&#8208;organic batteries (ZOBs). Developing new H+&#8208;storage organic cathode materials with multiple ultralow&#8208;energy&#8208;barrier protophilic sites and super electron delocalization routes to propel superior ZOBs is crucial but still challenging. Here we design multiple protophilic redox&#8208;active reticular organic skeletons (ROSs) for activating better proton storage, triggered by intermolecular H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions between 2,6&#8208;diaminoanthraquinone and 2,4,6&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol nanofibrous polymer. ROSs expose reticular electron delocalization geometries to fully access build&#8208;in protophilic carbonyl sites and promote ultrarapid H+ migration with an ultralow activation energy (0.13 vs. 0.29&#8197;eV of Zn2+ ions), thus delivering high capacity (359&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and large&#8208;current survivability (100&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). Moreover, the extended interconnected reticular structures strengthen the anti&#8208;dissolution of ROSs in aqueous electrolytes, affording long&#8208;lasting proton&#8208;storage activity in ZOBs to a superior level (60,000&#8197;cycles at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). Systematic studies identify the source of excellent charge storage as high&#8208;kinetics H+&#8208;coupled five&#8208;electron redox process of carbonyl motifs in superstable ROSs. These findings can be of importance for evoking superior proton activity in multiple redox organics to build advanced Zn&#8208;organic batteries.

         <title>Bias&#8208;Induced Ga&#8722;O&#8208;Ir Interface Breaks the Limits of Adsorption&#8208;Energy Scaling Relationships for High&#8208;Performing Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolyzers</title>

A highly active Ir catalyst supported on Ga2O3 was developed through bias&#8208;induced Ga leaching, promoting dynamic migration of oxygen species. Ga&#8722;O&#8722;Ir interfaces enhance water dissociation and OH* migration, improving catalytic activity. The catalyst showed a low overpotential (197&#8197;mV), and impressive performance in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) with a cell voltage of 1.63&#8197;V at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over 1000&#8197;hours.







Abstract
Rationally manipulating the in situ formed catalytically active surface of catalysts remains a significant challenge for achieving highly efficient water electrolysis. Herein, we present a bias&#8208;induced activation strategy to modulate in situ Ga leaching and trigger the dynamic surface restructuring of lamellar Ir@Ga2O3 for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction. The in situ reconstructed Ga&#8722;O&#8722;Ir interface sustains high water oxidation rates at oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotentials. We found that OER at the Ga&#8722;O&#8722;Ir interface follows a bi&#8208;nuclear adsorbate evolution mechanism with unsaturated IrOx as the active sites, while GaOx atoms play an indirect role in promoting water dissociation to form OH* and transferring OH* to Ir sites. This breaks the scaling relationship of the adsorption energies between OH* and OOH*, significantly lowering the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;limiting step and greatly increasing reactivity. The Ir@Ga2O3 catalyst achieves lower overpotentials, a current density of 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.76&#8197;V, and stable operation up to 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in scalable proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) at 1.63&#8197;V, maintaining stable operation at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over 1000&#8197;hours with a degradation rate of 11.5&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;h&#8722;1. This work prompted us to jointly address substrate&#8211;catalyst interactions and catalyst reconstruction, an underexplored path, to improve activity and stability in Ir PEMWE anodes.

         <title>Structural Isomerism of {Ag14}10+ Nanocluster Encapsulated by Bowl&#8208;like Polyoxometalates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented structural isomerism of {Ag14}10+ nanoclusters is for the first time observed in bowl&#8208;like polyoxometalate&#8208;encapsulated silver nanoclusters, {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;1 and {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;2. Such structural isomerism effect endows two clusters with distinct electronic structures and physicochemical properties.







Abstract
The structural isomerism of atomically precise nanoclusters provides a preeminent theoretical model to investigate the structure&#8722;property relationships. Herein, we synthesized three bowl&#8208;like polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;encapsulated Ag nanoclusters (denoted as {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;1, {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;1&#8201;a, and {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;2) via a facile one&#8208;pot solvothermal approach. Among them, for the first time, an unprecedented isomeric {Ag14}10+ nanoclusters are obtained in polyoxoanions {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;1 and {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;2, which should be probably induced by the different distribution of coordinating O atoms in two isomeric bowl&#8208;like {Sb3W30} ligands. Clusters {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;1 and {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;2 exhibit distinct electronic structures and physicochemical properties due to the different geometric structures of the {Ag14}10+ nanoclusters, but both clusters can effectively catalyze the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution with over 22,000 turnovers (TONs) after 6&#8208;hour photocatalysis.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Enhanced Spleen&#8208;Targeted mRNA Delivery via Fluorinated PEGylated Lipid Nanoparticles for Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a novel approach combining fluorinated PEG lipids and ultrasound to enhance spleen&#8208;targeted mRNA delivery. Ultrasound&#8208;induced rapid PEG lipid shedding promotes membrane fusion and efficient mRNA translation in antigen&#8208;presenting cells, significantly improving organ&#8208;specific delivery and transfection. This strategy holds great promise for advancing mRNA&#8208;based immunotherapy.







Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) based messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics hold immense promise for treating a wide array of diseases, while their nonhepatic organs targeting and insufficient endosomal escape efficiency remain challenges. For LNPs, polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipids have a crucial role in stabilizing them in aqueous medium, but they severely hinder cellular uptake and reduce transfection efficiency. In this study, we designed ultrasound (US)&#8208;assisted fluorinated PEGylated LNPs (F&#8208;LNPs) to enhance spleen&#8208;targeted mRNA delivery and transfection. Through liquid&#8208;to&#8208;gas phase transition, we enabled the controlled shedding of fluorinated PEG lipids from F&#8208;LNPs, facilitating cellular uptake, membrane fusion, and mRNA release. In vivo results demonstrated that US&#8208;assisted F&#8208;LNPs increased mRNA transfection approximately 4.0&#8208;fold in the spleen following intravenous administration. Notably, the F&#8208;LNPs achieved effective mRNA delivery to antigen&#8208;presenting cell subsets, such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. The targeted delivery of full&#8208;length ovalbumin&#8208;encoding mRNA vaccine induced significant CD8+ T cell response and exhibited excellent therapeutic effect against the ovalbumin&#8208;transduced B16F10 tumor model. These findings establish a novel strategy for spleen&#8208;specific mRNA delivery through the combination of fluorinated PEG lipids and US treatment, which holds substantial promise for enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy, potentially broadening the scope of clinical applications for mRNA&#8208;based therapy.

         <title>Nanopore&#8208;Based High&#8208;Resolution Detection of Multiple Post&#8208;Translational Modifications in Protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a simple and efficient nanopore sensing strategy based on host&#8208;guest interactions for detecting PTMs. It can identify 13 types of PTMs at specific peptide positions and is further enhanced by incorporating a short peptide into the probe, enabling differentiation of various PTMs, positional isomers, and multiple PTMs on the target peptide.







Abstract
Protein post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) play crucial roles in various cellular processes. Despite their significance, only a few PTMs have been extensively studied at the proteome level, primarily due to the scarcity of reliable, convenient, and low&#8208;cost sensing methods. Here, we present a straightforward and effective strategy for detecting PTMs on short peptides through host&#8208;guest interaction&#8208;assisted nanopore sensing. Our results demonstrate that the identity of 13 types of PTMs in a specific position of a phenylalanine&#8208;containing peptide could be determined via current blockage during translocation of the peptide through &#945;&#8208;hemolysin nanopores in the presence of cucurbit[7]uril. Furthermore, we extend this strategy by incorporating a short peptide into the probe, enabling the discrimination of various PTMs, positional isomers, and even multiple PTMs on the target peptide. With ongoing improvements, our method holds promise for practical applications in sensing PTMs in biologically relevant samples, offering an efficient alternative to traditional mass spectrometry approaches.

         <title>Photoelectrocatalyzed Alkylation of Phosphonites by Direct Decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8208;P Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inherent oxidation sensitivity of P(III) reagents has long hindered their application in oxidative coupling. However, the synergy of light and electricity enables a general, modular approach to the synthesis of functionalized alkylphosphonites from carboxylic acids under mild reaction conditions using P(III) compounds as limiting reagents. This strategy is applicable to the alkyl modification of medicinally important nucleoside&#8208;derived phosphonites.







Abstract
A photoelectrocatalytic method is presented that achieves direct decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8208;P coupling, providing a modular route to alkylphosphinates and alkylphosphonates from readily available carboxylic acids. The success of this reaction hinges on the synergistic combination of electrochemical anodic oxidation and photocatalytic ligand to metal charge transfer (LMCT) decarboxylation. By employing P(III) reagents as limiting reagents, our approach enables efficient alkyl modification of medicinally important nucleosides and complex molecules derived phosphonites, which were challenging to access by existing methods. Detailed mechanistic studies elucidate the critical roles of Fe catalysts and additives, offering valuable insights into the reaction pathway and laying the foundation for future advancements in photoelectrocatalytic C(sp3)&#8208;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions.

         <title>Lewis and Br&#248;nsted Acids Synergy in Photocatalytic Aerobic Alcohol Oxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acid sites were integrated into TiO2, which can supply coordinatively unsaturated sites to adsorb molecular oxygen and establish hydrogen bond with the OH groups of alcohols. The synergy of Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acid sites achieves efficient photocatalytic organic transformations.







Abstract
Photocatalytic chemical transformations for green organic synthesis has attracted much interest. However, their development is greatly hampered by the lack of sufficient reactive sites on the photocatalyst surface for the adsorption and activation of substrate molecules. Herein, we demonstrate that the introduction of well&#8208;defined Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acid sites coexisting on the surface of TiO2 (SO42&#8722;/N&#8208;TiO2) creates abundant active adsorption sites for photoredox reactions. The electron&#8208;deficient Lewis acid sites supply coordinatively unsaturated surface sites to adsorb molecular oxygen, and the Br&#248;nsted acid sites are liable to donate protons to form hydrogen bonds with the OH groups of alcohols like benzyl alcohol (BA). These coexistent acid sites result in a strong synergistic effect in photocatalytic aerobic oxidation of BA.

&lt;p&gt;The Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acid sites were integrated into TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which can supply coordinatively unsaturated sites to adsorb molecular oxygen and establish hydrogen bond with the OH groups of alcohols. The synergy of Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acid sites achieves efficient photocatalytic organic transformations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photocatalytic chemical transformations for green organic synthesis has attracted much interest. However, their development is greatly hampered by the lack of sufficient reactive sites on the photocatalyst surface for the adsorption and activation of substrate molecules. Herein, we demonstrate that the introduction of well-defined Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acid sites coexisting on the surface of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/N-TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) creates abundant active adsorption sites for photoredox reactions. The electron-deficient Lewis acid sites supply coordinatively unsaturated surface sites to adsorb molecular oxygen, and the Br&#248;nsted acid sites are liable to donate protons to form hydrogen bonds with the OH groups of alcohols like benzyl alcohol (BA). These coexistent acid sites result in a strong synergistic effect in photocatalytic aerobic oxidation of BA. For example, the conversion of BA to benzaldehyde was found to be 88.6&#8201;%, being much higher than those of pristine TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (14.7&#8201;%), N-doped TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (N-TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 24.6&#8201;%), sulfated TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/ TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 35.4&#8201;%), and even their sum. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was determined to be 58.1&#8201;% at 365&#8197;nm and 12.9&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm over SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Axially Chiral TADF Imidazolium Salts for Circularly Polarized Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of chiral thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) imidazolium compounds are synthesized by attaching imidazolium hexafluorophosphate to an axially chiral TADF framework. The chiral imidazolium salts showed small &#916;EST, high PLQY, strong CPL and excellent redox properties. Moreover, circularly polarized light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (CP&#8208;LECs) prepared with this compound, without additional ionic liquids, exhibit CPEL signals with |gEL| of 3.3&#215;10&#8722;3 and EQEmax of 5.2&#8201;%.







Abstract
A pair of axially chiral thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) enantiomers, R&#8208;TCBN&#8208;ImEtPF6 and S&#8208;TCBN&#8208;ImEtPF6, with intrinsic ionic characteristics were efficiently synthesized by introducing imidazolium hexafluorophosphate to chiral TADF unit. The TADF imidazolium salts exhibited a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of up to 92&#8201;%, a small singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap (&#9653;EST) of 0.04&#8197;eV, as well as reversible redox properties. Furthermore, the enantiomers showed distinct mirror&#8208;image CD and CPL activities with glum values of &#8722;3.7&#215;10&#8722;3 and +3.4&#215;10&#8722;3. Notably, by doping the axial TADF imidazolium salts into achiral TADF sensitizer, sandwich&#8208;structured light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) without the addition of ionic liquids (ILs) or ionic transition&#8208;metal compounds (iTMCs) were fabricated. When driven at 50&#8197;A m&#8722;2, the LECs displayed an EQE of up to 5.2&#8201;% and strong circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) with gEL values of +3.3&#215;10&#8722;3 and &#8722;3.0&#215;10&#8722;3. This represents the first CP&#8208;LEC based on TADF materials and offers a promising strategy for the development of high&#8208;performance CPEL devices.

         <title>Catalysis&#8208;driven active transport across a liquid membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biology has mastered energy transduction, converting energy between various forms, and employing it to drive its vital processes. Central to this is the ability to use chemical energy for the active transport of substances, pumping ions and molecules across hydrophobic lipid membranes between aqueous (sub)cellular compartments. Biology employs information ratchet mechanisms, where kinetic asymmetry in the fuel&#8208;to&#8208;waste (i.e., substrate&#8208;to&#8208;product) conversion results in catalysis&#8208;driven active transport. Here, we report an artificial system for catalysis&#8208;driven active transport across a liquid hydrophobic membrane, pumping a maleic acid cargo between aqueous compartments. We employ two strategies to differentiate the conditions in either compartment, showing that transmembrane active transport can be driven either by adding fuel to a single compartment, or by differentiating the rates of activation and/or hydrolysis when fuel is present in both compartments. We characterize the nonequilibrium system through complete kinetic analysis. Finally, we quantify the energy transduction achieved by the catalysis&#8208;driven active transport and establish the emergence of positive and negative feedback mechanisms within the system.</dc:description>

         <title>&#8216;Tearing Effect&#8217; of Alloy&#8211;Support Interaction for Alloy Redispersion in NiRu/TiO2 Hydrogenation Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supported alloy catalysts have been extensively applied to many significant industrial chemical processes due to the abundant active sites with distinguishable geometry and electron states. However, a detailed in&#8208;situ investigation of the interaction between support and alloy nanoparticles is still lacking. Here, a subversive &#8216;tearing effect&#8217; on the interface of TiO2&#8208;supported NiRu alloy nanoparticles is in&#8208;situ discovered by environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM) with a dramatic redispersion process of alloy nanoparticles from ~25 nm to 2&#8208;3 nm under the repeated hydrogen reduction. Dual&#8208;driven by the distinct alloy&#8208;support interaction involving the restructuring of alloy nanoparticles and growth of TiOx overlayer, larger NiRu alloy nanoparticles spontaneously disintegrate into atoms migrating on support. Atoms are finally captured by the defects generated on TiO2 during the repeat reduction, which also confines the further growth of the newly alloy nanoparticles. Owing to this specific alloy&#8208;support interaction, smaller alloy nanoparticles on TiO2 support are much more stable than the bigger ones, which holds promise for industrial applications as durable catalysts. This novel metal&#8208;support interaction with the &#8216;tearing effect&#8217; revealed on supported alloy catalysts provides new knowledge on the structure&#8208;performance relationships in all the alloy catalysts for hydrogenation reactions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The combustion of nitrogen&#8208;containing fuels and increasing use of nitrogen&#8208;rich fertilizers is accumulating NOx pollutants in the environment. Copper is an attractive catalyst material for reductive NOx remediation, yet ambiguity persists regarding the elementary bond&#8208;making and bond&#8208;breaking steps occurring at the catalyst interface.

         <title>Multiple Deuterium Atom Transfer Perdeuteration of Unactivated Alkenes under Base&#8208;Assisted Cobalt/Photoredox Dual Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A radical approach for hydrogenative perdeuteration of unactivated alkenes under cobalt/photoredox dual catalysis is described. The addition of a suitable base plays a key role in controlling two competing pathways by switching the catalytic performance of cobalt/photoredox catalysis. Base&#8208;assisted cobalt/photoredox dual catalysis promoted a hydrogen isotope exchange reaction of alkenes to afford deuterated alkenes via multiple repeating deuterium atom transfer/hydrogen atom abstraction processes, while consecutive reductive deuteration of alkenes proceeded in the absence of a base to afford polydeuterated alkanes. One&#8208;pot hydrogenative perdeuteration and perdeutero&#8208;arylation were also developed, providing access to various polydeuterated aliphatic compounds.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solution&#8208;processed &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite films frequently exhibit structural defects and impurities that impede the durable operation of solar cells. In this study, we introduced a conformationally stable, sterically bulky molecular passivator, bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diammonium iodide (BCPDAI), by spin&#8208;coating from an isopropanol solution onto the perovskite film surface, followed by thermal annealing. This treatment effectively converted PbI2 and &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 into a two&#8208;dimensional perovskite structure and significantly enhanced the crystal quality of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. The BCPDAI&#8208;treated perovskite films exhibited smoother surface morphology and reduced trap densities for charge carriers, leading to improved power conversion efficiency in the solar cells. Notably, the BCPDAI&#8208;modified perovskite films provided the solar cells with enhanced operational stability. Theoretical calculations demonstrated that the high positive charge density of BCPDA2+ confers greater binding energy at the perovskite surface and elevates the diffusion activation energy of the iodide anion.</dc:description>

         <title>Creation of dopant&#8208;plasmon synergism in double perovskites for bias&#8208;free photoelectrochemical synthesis of bromohydrins and hydrogen peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The integration of photoexcited charge carriers into the synthesis of valuable chemicals offers substantial sustainability benefits, particularly by replacing toxic and costly oxidants and reductants typically used in conventional processes. The efficiency of such transformations is fundamentally governed by the ability to optimize light absorption and charge carrier dynamics within photoelectrodes/photocatalysts. Herein, we present a Cu+/Cu2+&#8208;substituted double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 photoanode, embedded with plasmonic Ag nanoparticles, for bias&#8208;free photoelectrochemical production of bromohydrins and H2O2. Spectroscopic analyses, coupled with three&#8208;dimensional finite&#8208;difference time&#8208;domain simulations, demonstrate that the inclusion of Ag nanoparticles significantly enhances electromagnetic energy utilization and improves carrier separation efficiency. The synergistic effect of the Cu2+ and Ag nanoparticles results in a 7&#8208;fold increase in the yield of 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethanol, compared to pristine Cs2AgBiBr6, alongside an impressive H2O2 productivity of 25.8 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2. Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the Cu2+ substitution strengthens Br&#8722; adsorption and oxidation, promoting the bromohydroxylation of alkenes via electrophilic addition in the bulk solution. These findings offer critical insights into the design of advanced metal halide perovskites for sustainable and solar&#8208;driven chemical transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating Circular Polarized Luminescence and Long Persistent Luminescence in Cu8 Cage&#8208;Like Clusters via Ligand Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper clusters with diverse luminescent properties are of particular interest. In this study, a series of Cu8 clusters with cage&#8208;like structures was synthesized and characterized. By employing a stepwise ligand engineering strategy that progressively introduced circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and long persistent luminescence (LPL) properties, we successfully synthesized R/S&#8208;Cu8&#8208;Cl, the first copper cluster to demonstrate both CPL and LPL. The CPL originates from the chiral metal core induced by the chiral alkynyl ligand, whereas the LPL is attributed to the inherent properties of chlorine&#8208;modified triphenylphosphine, which is retained and modified after ligation. The polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) film containing Cu8 clusters displays lifetimes of up to 75.18 ms at room temperature and an afterglow exceeding 1.5 s, marking the longest luminescent lifetime recorded for molecular copper&#8208;cluster&#8208;based materials known to date. Additionally, R/S&#8208;Cu8&#8208;Cl shows excitation&#8208;dependent luminescence and variations in luminescence when UV light is switched on and off, highlighting its potential for advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications. This work not only presents innovative cage&#8208;like copper cluster structures but also offers new approaches for designing multifunctional clusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Leveraging Carbon Quantum Dot Spacers as Dual Proton/Electron Boosters to Upgrade TiO2@Polydopamine Photocatalysts for pH&#8208;resilient Conversion of O2 into H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic synthesis of H2O2 is a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) process, which is generally jeopardized by the kinetic mismatch between photogenerated electron transfer and proton supply. To address the challenge, here we proposed a new core&#8208;shell design of nanocomposite catalysts comprising of carbon quantum dot (CD)&#8208;topped TiO2 nanoparticles encapsulated by polydopamine (PDA) shells, which delivered stable catalytic activity across a pH range of 1 &#8211; 9, exhibiting a photocatalytic generation rate of H2O2 that reached 18.14 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 in methanol and 8.66 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 in water. This extraordinary, pH&#8208;tolerant photocatalytic generation of H2O2 was benefited from the innovative use of CDs, interspaced between the TiO2 cores and PDA shells, not only as a reservoir of protons to buffer the local acidic microenvironment but also as a proton/electron dual booster to sustain an excellent kinetic match between the proton and photogenerated electron transfer, thus enabling the O2 reduction to selectively proceed via two&#8208;electron reaction pathway over a wide pH span.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogenation of Organic Molecules via Direct Mechanocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanochemical hydrogenation of unsaturated C&#8208;C and C&#8208;O, as well as N&#8208;O and C&#8208;X bonds is successfully achieved without the use of solvents, ligands, or catalyst powders via ball milling. A variety of catalysts are electroplated onto the walls of the milling vessel, allowing for simple recycling and reuse of the catalytic material. Hydrogen gas is directly introduced into the milling vessel, eliminating the need for hydrogen donor compounds which contribute to waste production and suboptimal atom economy. This approach enables the quantitative hydrogenation of unsaturated carbon&#8208;carbon bonds, achieving near&#8208;complete conversion within just 20 minutes at ambient temperature and pressures as low as 1.5 bar. Carbonyls, nitro groups, and organohalides were converted within reaction times of up to 12&#160;hours. Mechanistic investigations suggest the reaction to be following established mechanisms for hydrogenation. Finally, chemoselective hydrogenation of various reducible functional groups was explored, demonstrating the versatility and efficiency of this solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical approach with simple catalyst recycling for hydrogenation reactions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Silver nanowire (AgNW) electrodes, known for their intrinsic flexibility and tunable optoelectronic properties, have garnered considerable attention for use in flexible organic solar cells (OSCs). However, in conventional OSCs, their low work function (WF) causes energy&#8208;level mismatches with classic aqueous hole transport layers (HTLs), while their poor hydrophilicity hinders the formation of optimized HTL morphology and crystallinity, posing challenges to their integration into high&#8208;performance OSCs. To address these issues, functionally targeted molecules with a thiol group at one end and strong electron&#8208;withdrawing, hydrophilic functional groups at the other are precisely engineered to wrap around the AgNW electrodes. The thiol group facilitates the formation of robust self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs) on the AgNW electrodes through stable S&#8208;Ag chemical bonds at room temperature. The strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups generate notable molecular and interfacial dipoles that effectively raise the WF of AgNW electrodes. Notably, the hydrophilic groups not only improve electrode wettability but also promote strong hydrogen bonding interactions with HTL, leading to substantial improvements in the morphology and crystallinity of the HTL. This precision wrapping strategy enables the fabrication of high&#8208;efficient conventional flexible OSCs, achieving a record power conversion efficiency of 18.84% (certified at 18.56%) for flexible OSCs based on ITO&#8208;free transparent electrodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Insights into Co&#8208;Catalytic Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Support Interactions for Boosting Sulfur Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with abundant electrocatalytic centers has been identified as the most desirable strategy to inhibit the shuttle effect in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. However, the co&#8208;contribution from SAC and its support via their interactions for accelerating the sulfur reduction reactions (SRR) has so far received little attention, since the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Herein, guided by density functional theory calculations, Cobalt&#8208;SACs supported on a graphitic carbon nitride substrate (Co&#8208;GCN), are selected to elucidate the co&#8208;catalytic role in enhancing the SRR. The inherent high charge polarity of GCN, combined with its unique tri&#8208;s&#8208;triazine structure, offers multiple binding sites for lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) through Li&#8208;N bonds, as well as N/C&#8208;coordinated frameworks for anchoring Co&#8208;SACs. This structural configuration further amplifies the interaction with LiPSs via Co&#8208;S bonds. Consequently, both Co&#8208;SACs and GCN actively participate in sulfur reduction electrocatalysis by binding LiPS intermediates, lowering the conversion energy barrier of SRR. Benefitting from such unique synergy, the battery demonstrates outstanding rate performance (718.9 mAh g&#8208;1 at 5.0 C) and yields a high areal capacity of up to 13.8 mAh cm&#8208;2 (1584.3 mAh g&#8208;1) under a high areal sulfur loading of 8.7 mg cm&#8208;2 but a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 5.0 &#956;L mg&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Accessing a Carboxyl&#8208;Anhydride Molecular Switch&#8208;Mediated Recyclable PECT Through Upcycling End&#8208;of&#8208;Use PET</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly(ethylene terephthalate)&#160;(PET), with an annual production of exceeding 70 million tons, is mainly utilized in disposable fields and subsequently contribute to severe environmental pollution. Conventional chemical recycling, which typically involves depolymerizing polymer into monomers, is limited due to the intricate recycling process, excess using unrecyclable solvents and low polymer conversion. Inspired by protein&#8217;s molecular switches, we propose a novel polymer&#8208;to&#8208;polymer recycling strategy based on polycondensation principles upcycling waste PET to high&#8208;value recyclable poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedimethanol terephthalate) derivatives containing molecular switches. Upon deactivating the molecular switch, an acidification reaction occurs within the system, leading to a rapid and controllable reduction in molecular weight due to the imbalance of reactive group. Conversely, activating the molecular switch triggers a ring&#8208;closing reaction that detaches acid anhydrides, bringing about equal molar ratio of groups and thereby facilitating an increase in molecular weight. By simply incorporating a molecular switch into condensation products based on melt polycondensation, closed&#8208;loop recycling capability is achieved without necessitating excessive organic solvents or complex depolymerization processes. The present study not only presents a novel pathway for end&#8208;of&#8208;use PET upcycling but also introduces an innovative concept of molecular switching for the closed&#8208;loop recyclability of condensation polymers, thereby demonstrating significant potential for large&#8208;scale implementation.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing the Potential of a Chimaera: a Peptide&#8208;Peptide Nucleic Acid Molecule Designed To Interact with the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Nucleocapsid Protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Numerous RNA&#8208;binding proteins have modular structures with folded domains and intrinsically disordered regions, making their atomic characterization difficult. This severely limits the investigation of their modalities of interaction as well as the evaluation of possible ways to interfere with this process. We report herein a rational strategy for the design and synthesis of a ligand able to interfere with the protein function, monitoring the interaction through solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Our approach employs a chimaera composed of two different fragments, a peptide and a peptide&#8208;nucleic acid, allowing to incorporate in the resulting molecule key features to address RNA&#8208;protein interactions. Focusing on two constructs of the N protein from SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, the globular N&#8208;terminal domain and a more extended one comprising also two flanking intrinsically disordered regions, we demonstrate the enhanced affinity of the designed peptide&#8208;peptide nucleic acid chimaera for the protein compared to a related peptide lacking &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking contributions within the chain. Furthermore, we emphasize the increasingly recognized relevant and synergistic role of the intrinsically disordered regions in protein&#8208;ligand interaction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Catalytic epoxidation of readily available aldehydes with diazo compounds is an atom economical strategy to synthesize epoxides. However, the asymmetric epoxidation reaction of aldehydes and fluorinated diazo compounds is challenging, because of the severe racemic background reaction. Herein, we report the first Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective epoxidation reaction between aldehydes and &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl diazosilanes for the synthesis of chiral trifluoromethyl epoxides. This reaction features mild conditions, broad substrate scope, excellentdiastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity. The observed positive nonlinear effect supports the ligand acceleration and the achievement of high enantioselectivity with a chiral ligand possessing lower enantiopurity. The gram scale reaction and down&#8208;stream transformation based on the removable silyl group demonstrated the synthetic potential of the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Straightforward Formation of Borirenes from Boroles and Dialkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of unsymmetrical perarylated aromatic borirenes through a straightforward reaction between 1,3&#8208;diynes and boroles is reported. The study encompasses substrate scope exploration, X&#8208;ray studies and computational analysis. This work represents an illustration of the use of simplified reactions for the construction of three&#8208;membered systems containing boron.







Abstract
We report a selective one&#8208;step synthesis of perarylated borirenes by reaction of antiaromatic boroles with 1,4&#8208;diarylbuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diynes. Mechanistic studies, both experimental and computational, reveal key intermediates, including boranorbornadiene and 7&#8208;borabicyclo[4.1.0]heptadiene species, which are all in equilibrium with each other, ultimately leading to borirene formation by migration of the boranediyl bridge from the cyclohexadiene ring to the remaining exocyclic alkyne residue.

&lt;p&gt;We report a selective one-step synthesis of perarylated borirenes by reaction of antiaromatic boroles with 1,4-diarylbuta-1,3-diynes. Mechanistic studies, both experimental and computational, reveal key intermediates, including boranorbornadiene and 7-borabicyclo[4.1.0]heptadiene species, which are all in equilibrium with each other, ultimately leading to borirene formation by migration of the boranediyl bridge from the cyclohexadiene ring to the remaining exocyclic alkyne residue.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Anionic Mesoionic Carbene (anMIC) and its Transformation to Metallo MIC&#8208;Boranes: Synthesis and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first general synthesis of triazole&#8208;based anionic mesoionic carbene and their follow&#8208;up chemistry are presented.







Abstract
Neutral mesoionic carbenes (MICs) based on a 1,2,3&#8208;triazole core have had a strong impact on various branches of chemistry such as homogeneous catalysis, electrocatalysis, and photochemistry/photophysics. We present here the first general synthesis of anionic mesoionic carbenes (anMICs, 2) based on a 1,2,3&#8208;triazole core and a borate backbone. The free anMIC is stable in solution under an inert atmosphere at low temperatures, and can be stored for several weeks. Analysis of donor properties shows that these anMICs are extremely strong &#963;&#8208;donors, bypassing the donor properties of strong donors such as MICs, NHCs, anionic NHCs and N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins. The room temperature conversion of the free anMICs leads to three equally interesting compound classes: an amide&#8208;coordinated borane based on a MIC&#8208;borane backbone (2BR3), a polymeric triazolide (1Li) and an amide&#8208;coordinated metallo&#8208;MIC&#8208;borane. The metallo&#8208;MIC&#8208;borane (3Li) is an interesting precursor for the synthesis of further amide&#8208;coordinated MIC&#8208;borane compounds. Quantum chemical calculations have been used to elucidate the mechanism of transformation of the anMICs. We thus introduce three new categories of mesoionic compounds here with potential for different branches of chemistry and beyond.

         <title>Converting Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C Single&#8208;atom Catalyst to a New FeNxSey Cluster Catalyst for Proton&#8208;exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work successfully converts Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst to an entirely new Fennessey cluster catalyst, which is highly active, selective, and strong H2O2&#8208;tolerance for proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells.







Abstract
Iron&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C) single&#8208;atom catalyst is the most promising alternative to platinum catalyst for proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), however its high performance cannot be maintained for a long enough time in device operation. The construction of a new Fe coordination environment that is completely different from the square&#8208;planar Fe&#8722;N4 configuration in classic Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst is expected to break the current stability limits of Pt&#8208;free catalysts, which however remains unexplored. Here, we report, for the first time, the conversion of Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst to a new FeNxSey cluster catalyst, where the active Fe sites are three&#8208;dimensionally (3D) co&#8208;coordinated by N and Se atoms. Due to this unique Fe coordination configuration, the FeNxSey catalyst exhibits much better 4e&#8722; ORR activity and selectivity than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst. Specifically, the yields of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and &#8901;OH radicals on the FeNxSey catalyst are only one&#8208;quarter and one&#8208;third of that on the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C counterpart, respectively. Therefore, the FeNxSey catalyst exhibits outstanding cyclic stability, losing only 10&#8197;mV in half&#8208;wave potential E1/2 after 10,000 potential cycles, much smaller than that of the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst (56&#8197;mV), representing the most stable Pt&#8208;free catalysts ever reported for PEMFCs. More significantly, the 3D co&#8208;coordination structure effectively inhibits the Fe demetallization of the FeNxSey catalyst in the presence of H2O2. As a result, the FeNxSey based PEMFC shows excellent durability, with the current density attenuation significantly lower than that of the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C based device after accelerated durability testing. Our work provides guidance for the development of next&#8208;generation Pt&#8208;free catalysts for PEMFCs.

         <title>Glucuronidase&#8208;Instructed Glycopeptide Self&#8208;Assembly for Selective Killing of Cancer Cells through Lysosomal Membrane Permeabilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Current cancer treatments face significant challenges, including limited tumor specificity and drug resistance. Enzyme&#8208;instructed supramolecular peptide assembly targeting lysosomes offers a promising strategy to address these issues; however, self&#8208;assembling units that withstand lysosomal conditions are still scarce. In this study, we present a versatile glycopeptide incorporating glucuronic acid and glucose that undergoes glucuronidase&#8208;triggered self&#8208;assembly to form nanofibers, leading to lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) in cancer cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that in glucuronidase&#8208;overexpressing HepG2 cells, glycopeptide assembly induces cytoskeletal disruption and apoptosis. The involvement of carbohydrate&#8208;binding receptor in enhancing the cellular entry of glycopeptides and improving proteolytic stability highlights the importance of glycan modification. Notably, combining this glycopeptide with cisplatin or adriamycin results in synergistic cytotoxicity, including in drug&#8208;resistant cancer lines. These findings establish a novel, LMP&#8208;inducing glycopeptide scaffold for developing targeted approaches for cancer treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Azo Dye Removal through Sequential Ultrasound&#8208;Assisted&#8208;Treatment&#160;and Photocatalysis Using CdZnS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The treatment of high&#8208;concentration azo dyes remains challenging due to the inherent limitations of conventional single&#8208;mode approaches. Here, we propose an integrated strategy that sequentially combines ultrasound&#8208;assisted&#8208;adsorption with photocatalysis using CdZnS solid solutions to efficiently and rapidly remove high&#8208;concentration azo dyes. CdZnS exhibits high adsorption capacity and exceptional photocatalytic activity, enabling initial dye capture and enrichment, followed by significantly enhanced photocatalytic degradation. The adsorption of Congo Red (CR) on CdZnS solid solutions follows the Freundlich and pseudo&#8208;second&#8208;order models, demonstrating a multilayer adsorption behavior involving physical and chemical interactions. Ultrasound assistance during the first stage not only significantly reduces equilibrium time, but also results in enhanced negative charges in CdZnS that extend to the subsequent photocatalysis stage. This charge enhancement substantially improves CR photodegradation performance, establishing synergistic interactions between ultrasonic treatment and photodegradation. The system demonstrates excellent performance in treating both concentrated single dyes and complex dye mixtures, maintaining high efficiency over multiple treatment cycles. This integrated approach provides new insights for developing more effective technologies for dye degradation and practical wastewater treatment applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Engineering Spatially Separated Redox Centers Enable Efficient Piezo&#8208;Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Piezo&#8208;photocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from water and air is promising but still challenging as insufficient reaction active sites and low reaction efficiency. We have ingeniously applied molecular engineering methods to design an anthraquinone molecularly grafted metal&#8208;organic framework piezo&#8208;photocatalyst (denoted as UiO&#8208;66&#8208;AQ) for H2O2 generation from water and air. The catalyst achieves a peak H2O2 yield of 7872.4 &#956;M g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, primarily owing to the presence of spatially separated redox sites that enable simultaneously two&#8208;step single&#8208;electron water oxidation and two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reactions. Notably, experimental and computational simulations confirm rapid carrier separation under the ligand&#8208;to&#8208;chain charge transfer mode. Electrons transfer to the AQ part and rapidly form internal peroxides for spontaneous oxygen reduction reaction while holes direct to the UiO&#8208;66 ligand for the water oxidation reaction. Additionally, a continuous flow tubular reactor with catalytic membranes made of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;AQ affords 96% removal of organic dyes through the self&#8208;Fenton process under visible light and vibrating water flow, confirming the significant potential of the catalyst for practical applications. This work deepens the understanding of directional carrier migration at piezo&#8208;photocatalytic spatial separation sites, opening new pathways for environmentally friendly and efficient H2O2 synthesis.</dc:description>

This work deepens the understanding of directional carrier migration at piezo-photocatalytic spatial separation sites, opening new pathways for environmentally friendly and efficient H2O2 synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrolyte Design Using "Porous Water&#8221; for High&#8208;purity Carbon Monoxide Electrosynthesis from Dilute Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrosynthesis of high&#8208;purity carbon monoxide (CO) from captured carbon dioxide (CO&#8322;) remains energy&#8208;intensive due to the unavoidable CO&#8322; regeneration and post&#8208;purification stages. Here, we propose a direct high&#8208;purity CO electrosynthesis strategy employing an innovative electrolyte, termed porous electrolyte (PE), based on "porous water". Zeolite nanocrystals within PE provide permanent pores in the liquid phase, enabling physical CO&#8322; adsorption through an intraparticle diffusion model, as demonstrated by molecular dynamics simulations and in&#8208;situ spectral analysis. Captured CO&#8322; spontaneously desorbs under applied reductive potential, driven by the interfacial CO&#8322; concentration gradient, and is subsequently reduced electrochemically. The high CO&#8322; concentration in PE enhances mass transfer, and surface ion exchange between Si&#8211;OH groups and K&#8314; ions on the zeolite surface generates a stronger interfacial electric field, promoting electron transfer steps. This optimized kinetics for mass and electron transfer confers heightened intrinsic activity toward CO&#8322; electroreduction. The PE&#8208;based electrolysis system demonstrated superior CO Faradaic efficiency &#160;and partial current density compared to the conventional CO&#8322;&#8208;fed system. A circular system using PE and a Ni&#8208;N/C cathode realized continuous production of high&#8208;purity CO (97.0 wt%) from dilute CO2 (15%) and maintained &gt; 90.0 wt% under 150 mA cm&#8208;2, with significantly reduced energy consumption and costs.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Chiral Ferrocenyl Aminoalcohols: Simultaneous Induction of Multiple Types of Chirality by a Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Ring&#8208;Opening Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral ferrocenyl aminoalcohols&#160;were enantioselectively synthesized via the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric aminative ring&#8208; opening of 1,4&#8208;epoxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalenylferrocenes. A planar chiral phosphine&#8208;olefin ligand consisting of&#160;a&#160;cyclopentadienyl (Cp) manganese scaffold&#160;provided excellent catalytic performance, furnishing the ring&#8208;opening products&#160;in high yield and enantioselctivity (up to 99:1 enantiomeric ratio (e.r.)). The enantioselectivity could be further improved by changing the steric congestion in the cyclopentadienyl unit of the ferrocenyl fragment of&#160;the starting&#160;1,4&#8208;epoxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalenylferrocene. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed the high enantioselective induction in the ring&#8208;opening reaction, estimating an e.r. of 99:1, which is in excellent agreement with the experimental results. The application of the thus obtained chiral ferrocenyl aminoalcohols&#160;as ligands in asymmetric reactions was also investigated.</dc:description>

         <title>Reinventing the High&#8208;rate Energy Storage of Hard Carbon: the Order&#8208;degree Governs the Trade&#8208;off of Desolvation &#8212;Solid Electrolyte Interphase at Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In alkali metal&#8208;ion battery systems, the electrolyte enables being decomposed on the electrode surface to form a solid electrolyte interphase film (SEI). In principle, a thin, uniform SEI film facilitates to enhancement of the performance of the cell. Herein, we successfully distinguish the effects of desolvation behavior and SEI process on the kinetic behavior of hard carbon (HC) electrodes by adopting the strategy of switching the electrolyte interface model to modulate the properties of SEI film. Our findings reveal that although the SEI film is generally responsible for significantly affecting the HC&#8217;s capacity, the equally crucial desolvation process must not be overlooked. The trade&#8208;off between the two factors is found to be determined by the structural features of HCs. Specifically, in the context of a more ordered HC, the desolvation of ions emerges as the rate&#8208;limiting step for Na+ transport across the electrode/electrolyte interface, exerting a more pronounced effect rather than the SEI. Thus, a close correlation was established between the SEI, solvation structure effects, hard carbon structure, and electrode performance. This linkage is thereof fundamental for the strategic design of electrolytes and the targeted enhancement of cell performance.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report herein an unprecedented desymmetrization of 1,4&#8208;diynes via a Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric redox cycloisomerization. This method adopts allylic alcohol&#8208;containing diynes and provides efficient access to multi&#8208;functional pyrrolidines and tetrahydrofurans in high to excellent stereoselectivities. Mechanistic studies highlighted an innovative catalytic pathway that differs from the classical enyne cycloisomerization and involves initiation at the allylic alcohol moiety. Diverse derivatizations of the heterocycle products including intriguing skeletal rearrangements have also been demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Practical High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries Enabled by the In&#8208;Situ Fabrication of Main&#8208;Chain Fluorinated Polymer Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer electrolytes are crucial for advancing safe, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium batteries. Therefore, such electrolytes must possess stability with high&#8208;voltage cathodes and lithium metal, ensuring efficient interfacial contact and high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity. In this study, we present a novel main&#8208;chain fluorinated polymer electrolyte, FEOP, synthesized through cationic ring&#8208;opening polymerization. FEOP integrates high oxidative resistance of polytetrafluoroethylene with lithium metal compatibility of polyether, achieving an oxidation potential of up to 5.6 V and an anion&#8208;involved solvation structure. The exceptional stability enables NCM811 cells to deliver an impressive cycling life of 2000 cycles at 1 C up to 4.5 V. Furthermore, at ultra&#8208;high cut&#8208;off voltages of 4.7 and 4.9 V, both NCM811 and LNMO cells demonstrate stable cycling over 700 cycles, marking the longest lifespan for polymer&#8208;based batteries under these challenging conditions. Moreover, 4.7 V solid&#8208;state lithium metal pouch cells incorporating FEOP exhibit an energy density of 405.3 Wh kg&#8722;1 and maintain stable cycling over 70 cycles, while successfully passing industry&#8208;standard nail penetration tests. Moreover, FEOP demonstrate excellent compatibility with ultra&#8208;high&#8208;loading electrode (70 mg cm&#8722;2), achieving an exceptional areal capacity of 16.2 mAh cm&#8722;2. These results provide a solid foundation for designing practical electrolytes that enable next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and high&#8208;safety solid&#8208;state batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Redirecting On&#8208;surface Cycloaddition Reactions in a Self&#8208;assembled Ordered Molecular Array on Graphite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of atomically precise carbon nanostructures in ultra&#8208;high vacuum has seen extensive progress on metal surfaces. However, this remains challenging on chemically inert surfaces. It is because the thermally activated C&#8208;C coupling encounters a severe &#8220;desorption problem&#8221; on weakly interacting substrates. In this study, we report an extraordinary [2+2]+[2+2] cycloaddition triggered by mild annealing (~210&#176;C) in a highly ordered &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecular array on graphite using scanning tunneling microscopy. In contrast to irregular dendritic fragments typically obtained on metal substrates, large supramolecular islands are observed here with cycloaddition products and other polymers over 30%, which are embedded as defective individuals or chains (grain boundaries). First&#8208;principles calculations reveal that the energy barriers of the multiple dehalogenation, dehydrogenation, and cycloaddition reactions are reduced by catalytic Fe atoms but remain energetically unfavorable. A distinct driving mechanism is proposed for redirecting the reactions on inert surfaces, where additional intermolecular coupling, steric hindrance, and/or interfacial interactions play significant roles. This study introduces a new paradigm for understanding on&#8208;surface synthesis on non&#8208;metal substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Activating Organic Electrode for Zinc Batteries via Adjusting Solvation Structure of Zn Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc&#8208;organic batteries, combining the low cost and high capacity of Zn anodes with the tunable and sustainable properties of organic cathodes, have garnered significant attention. Herein, we present a zinc&#8208;organic battery featuring a poly(benzoquinonyl sulfide) (PBQS) cathode, a Zn anode, and an&#160;N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF)&#8208;based electrolyte, which delivers a high capacity (200 mAh g&#8208;1), excellent rate capability, and an ultra&#8208;long cycle life (10,000 cycles) when tested with a low PBQS loading (2 mg cm&#8208;2). The charge storage mechanism in the PBQS cathode involves solvated Zn2+ adsorption and consequent Zn2+ coordination with PBQS companied by de&#8208;solvation process, as confirmed by in&#8208;situ FT&#8208;IR analysis. However, sluggish Zn2+ de&#8208;solvation leads to a loss of Zn2+ coordination capacity when tested with higher PBQS loading (8 mg cm&#8208;2) even at a low current density of 0.2 A g&#8208;1. Remarkably, the addition of 2% H2O to the DMF electrolyte incorporates 0.24 H2O into the primary solvation sheath of Zn2+, significantly facilitating the de&#8208;solvation process. As a result, the PBQS cathode (8 mg cm&#8208;2) retains its Zn2+ storage capacity when using the modified electrolyte. This approach offers a new strategy for improving the rate performance of organic electrodes, complementing existing conductivity enhancements.</dc:description>

         <title>Intrinsic Distortion Against Jahn&#8208;Teller Distortion: A New Paradigm for High&#8208;Stability Na&#8208;Ion Layered Mn&#8208;Rich Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered manganese&#8208;rich oxides (LMROs) are widely recognized as the leading cathode candidates for grid&#8208;scale sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their high specific capacities and cost benefits, but the notorious Jahn&#8208;Teller (J&#8208;T) distortion of Mn3+ always induces severe structural degradation and consequent rapid cathode failure, impeding the practical implementation of such materials. Herein, we unveil the&#160;"intrinsic distortion against J&#8208;T distortion"&#160;mechanism to effectively stabilize the layered frameworks of LMRO cathodes. The intrinsic distortion simply constructed by introducing bulk oxygen vacancies is systematically confirmed by advanced synchrotron X&#8208;ray techniques, atomic&#8208;scale imaging characterizations, and theoretical computations, which can counteract the J&#8208;T distortion during cycling due to their opposite deformation orientations. This greatly decreases and uniformizes the lattice strain within the ab plane and along the c axis of the material, thereby alleviating the P2&#8208;P'2 phase transition as well as suppressing the edge dislocation and intragranular crack formation upon repeated cycles. As a result, the tailored P2&#8208;Na0.72Mg0.1Mn0.9O2 cathode featuring intrinsic distortion delivers a considerably enhanced cycling durability (91.9% capacity retention after 500 cycles) without sacrificing the Mn3+/Mn4+ redox capacity (186.5 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.3 C). This intrinsic distortion engineering paves a brand&#8208;new and prospective avenue toward achieving high&#8208;performance LMRO cathodes for SIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking the Power of Photothermal Agents: A Universal Platform for Smart Immune NIR&#8208;Agonists for Precise Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective ablation of tumor cells allows safe eradication, thereby minimizing off&#8208;target damage, while specifically inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD) rather than commonly non&#8208;immunogenic apoptosis of tumor cells enables activation of anti&#8208;tumor immune response against residual cancer cells, including metastatic lesions. Herein, we present a general strategy leveraging a novel photothermal agent (PTA) that concomitantly enables precise tumor killing and activation of anti&#8208;tumor immunity. The unique PTA scaffold exhibits unexpected inherent endoplasmic reticulum (ER)&#8208;targeting capability and potent near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal activity, inducing NIR&#8208;controlled immunogenic pyroptosis in various tumor cell lines via targeting ER stress in an oxygen&#8208;independent manner. Moreover, both ER&#8208;targeting and NIR&#8208;activity of our scaffold can be modulated on demand by chemical caging/uncaging, allowing quick activation with diverse biological and bioorthogonal molecular triggers. The potency of this universal platform is demonstrated via its application to develop a membrane protein&#8208;activatable NIR&#8208;agonist that selectively activates ICD in tumor sites while priming anti&#8208;tumor immunity, minimizing off&#8208;target effects and enhancing efficacy against mouse breast tumors. This versatile approach could lead to customization of various personalized and effective immune NIR&#8208;agonists for specific photoimmunotherapy applicable to diverse solid tumors.</dc:description>

         <title>Diplatinum Single&#8208;Molecular Photocatalyst Capable of Driving Hydrogen Production from Water via Singlet&#8208;to&#8208;Triplet Transitions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;driven hydrogen production is regarded as one of the most ideal methods to achieve a sustainable society. In order to artificially establish efficient photosynthetic systems, efforts have been made to develop single&#8208;molecular photocatalysts capable of serving both as a photosensitizer (PS) and a catalyst (Cat) in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Although examples of such hybrid molecular photocatalysts have been demonstrated in the literature, their solar energy conversion efficiencies still remain quite limited. Here we demonstrate that a new dinuclear platinum(II) complex Pt2(bpia)Cl3&#160;(bpia = bis(2&#8208;pyridylimidoyl)amido) serves as a single&#8208;molecular photocatalyst for HER with its performance significantly higher than that of the PtCl(tpy)&#8208; and PtCl2(bpy)&#8208;type photocatalysts developed in our group (tpy = 2,2&#8242;:&#8198;6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine, bpy = 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine). The outstanding feature is that Pt2(bpia)Cl3 can produce H2 even by irradiating the lower&#8208;energy light above 500 nm, which is rationalized due to the direct population of triplet states via singlet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet transitions (i.e., S&#8208;T transitions) accelerated by the diplatinum core.&#160;To the best of our knowledge, Pt2(bpia)Cl3 is the first example of a single&#8208;molecular photocatalyst enabling hydrogen production from water via the S&#8208;T transitions using lower&#8208;energy light (&gt; 580 nm).</dc:description>

         <title>Preparation of Degradable and Sequence&#8208;Controlled Aliphatic Polysulfones by Group Transfer Radical Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of sulfur atoms into polymer backbones for the synthesis of sulfur&#8208;containing polymers, such as aliphatic polysulfones, not only enhances degradability but also imparts many distinctive properties to these materials. Traditional synthetic methods encounter substantial challenges in achieving sequence&#8208;controlled aliphatic polysulfones with high molecular weights (MW), which significantly limits their applications. We report a novel approach for synthesizing aliphatic polysulfones using the strategy of sulfonyl radical&#8208;mediated group transfer radical polymerization (GTRP). This protocol employs a practical SO2&#8208;free pathway and produces a series of ABC sequence&#8208;defined high&#8208;MW polymers (up to 199 kg/mol). The resultant aliphatic polysulfone exhibits remarkable full&#8208;degradability at ambient temperature under strong basic conditions, and offers optical properties&#8212;including refractive index and Abbe number&#8212;comparable to those of commercially utilized polycarbonate. Additionally, density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been performed to corroborate the non&#8208;desulfonylative Smiles rearrangement mechanism implicated in the GTRP process.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence in Solution Phase from Carbon Dots Confined in Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dots (CDs) have attracted growing interest in the construction of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials. However, in the solution phase of CDs, it is still challenging to obtain efficient and stable phosphorescent emission due to the intense quenching effect by dissolved oxygen and solvent molecules. Herein, we report robust phosphorescence in the solution phase, achieved by encapsulating citrate&#8208;derived CDs into NaYF4 nanocrystals via a one&#8208;step method of high&#8208;temperature coprecipitation. Combined characterizations show that the triplet emission from CDs is related to the abundance of C=O in the CDs, the formation of ionic&#8208;bond networks around the CDs, and the spatial confinement and quenching inhibition effects of NaYF4 nanocrystals. Notably, the transition of CDs@NaYF4 from hydrophobicity to hydrophilicity can be easily achieved by simple surface modulation of NaYF4 nanocrystals, which allows the RTP of CDs to be maintained in either polar or nonpolar solvents. In addition, CDs@NaYF4 exhibits stable afterglow in different pH environments, suggesting its excellent stability. Finally, we demonstrated the application of CDs@NaYF4 in 3D printing, oily anti&#8208;counterfeiting patterns, and cell imaging. Our work can serve the controllable preparation of solution&#8208;phase RTP materials and their various applications.</dc:description>

Notably, the transition of CDs@NaYF4 from hydrophobicity to hydrophilicity can be easily achieved by simple surface modulation of NaYF4 nanocrystals, which allows the RTP of CDs to be maintained in either polar or nonpolar solvents. In addition, CDs@NaYF4 exhibits stable afterglow in different pH environments, suggesting its excellent stability. Finally, we demonstrated the application of CDs@NaYF4 in 3D printing, oily anti-counterfeiting patterns, and cell imaging. Our work can serve the controllable preparation of solution-phase RTP materials and their various applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;optimizing Cobalt Tungsten Oxide Electrocatalysts toward Enhanced Oxygen Evolution in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;optimizing mixed metal oxides represent a novel class of electrocatalysts for the advanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, we report self&#8208;assembled cobalt tungsten oxide nanostructures on a lab&#8208;synthesized copper oxide substrate through a single&#8208;step deposition approach. The resulting composite exhibits remarkable self&#8208;optimization behavior, shown by significantly reduced overpotentials and enhanced current densities, accompanied with substantial increase in OER kinetics, electrocatalytically active surface area, surface wettability, and electrical conductivity. Under operating conditions, interfacial restructuring of the electrocatalyst reveals the in situ formation of oxidized cobalt species as the true active site. Complementary density functional theory (DFT) calculations further demonstrate the formation of *OOH intermediate as the rate&#8208;determining step of OER, and highlight the adaptive binding of oxygen intermediates, which transitions from tungsten to cobalt sites during OER process. Our study provides a fundamental understanding of the self&#8208;optimization mechanism and advances the knowledge&#8208;driven design of efficient water&#8208;splitting electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating Two Photochromics into One Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework for Synergistically Enhancing Multiple Photocatalytic Oxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While photocatalytic oxidations are a category of important reactions in wide chemical synthesis, the fabrication of effective photocatalysts for broad oxidation reactions is still of a great challenge. Herein, by rationally integrating two photochromics, porphyrin and triphenylamine, a three&#8208;dimensional photoactive covalent organic framework (COF) is successfully constructed for photocatalytic oxidations. Characterization studies not only show the formation of a crystalline and three&#8208;dimensional porous framework, but also reveal its effective photochemical semiconductor properties derived from the porphyrin and triphenylamine moieties. Electron paramagnetic resonance measurements indicate that the COF is an effective photocatalyst for the generation of both singlet oxygen (1O2) and superoxide radical anions (&#183;O2&#8722;). Synergistically enhanced efficiency in all photocatalytic reactions of photocatalytic aerobic oxidation of alkylbenzenes and silanes as well as thioanisoles, and cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reaction of N&#8208;phenyltetrahydroisoquinoline and indole is confirmed by both experimental and theoretical studies, demonstrating its promising potential for broad photocatalytic oxidation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Trifluoromethylazidation of Styrenyl Olefins Catalyzed by an Engineered Nonheme Iron Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new&#8208;to&#8208;nature enzymatic platform for the enantioselective trifluoromethylazidation of alkenes has been successfully established. Through 11 rounds of directed evolution, an engineered variant of nonheme iron enzyme, BsQueD&#8208;CF3, was developed, enabling the production of a wide range of enantioenriched CF3&#8208;containing molecules. This platform based on metalloenzymes would open a new avenue for biocatalytic trifluoromethylation chemistry.







Abstract
Organofluorines, particularly those containing trifluoromethyl (CF3) groups, play a critical role in medicinal chemistry. While trifluoromethylation of alkenes provides a powerful synthetic route to construct CF3&#8208;containing compounds with broad structural and functional diversity, achieving enantioselective control in these reactions remains a formidable challenge. In this study, we engineered a nonheme iron enzyme, quercetin 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase from Bacillus subtilis (BsQueD), for the enantioselective trifluoromethylazidation of alkenes. Through directed evolution, the final variant BsQueD&#8208;CF3 exhibited excellent enantioselectivity, with an enantiomeric ratio (e.r.) of up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest the involvement of radical intermediates. This work expands biocatalytic organofluorine chemistry by reprogramming metalloenzymes for innovative trifluoromethylation reactions.

         <title>Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry to Probe Sequences in Supramolecular Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion mobility &#8208; mass spectrometry (IM&#8211;MS) allows discrimination of isomers of a supramolecular copolymer based on their collision cross&#8208;section (CCS). Our study carried out with benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide co&#8208;assemblies opens the door to the identification and quantification of sequences in the field of supramolecular copolymers.







Abstract
The analysis of the microstructure of supramolecular copolymers is difficult because of their dynamic character. Here, benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) co&#8208;assemblies are analysed by ion mobility &#8211; mass spectrometry (IM&#8211;MS) to reveal the presence of various sequences. For example, the IM&#8211;MS mobilogram for hexamers composed of 4&#8197;units from a first monomer and 2&#8197;units from a second monomer is a broad distribution due to the presence of 9 possible isomeric sequences, which can be sorted out based on calculated collision cross&#8208;sections. This approach gives unprecedented information on supramolecular copolymer sequences.

         <title>Promiscuity Guided Evolution of Decarboxylative Aldolases for Synthesis of Tertiary &#947;&#8208;Hydroxy Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Promiscuity guided evolution of the decarboxylative aldolase, UstD, resulted in an efficient biocatalyst for synthesis of tertiary &#947;&#8208;hydroxy non&#8208;canonical amino acids. Simultaneous collection of variant activity and promiscuity was enabled by competition screening during directed evolution. Changes in promiscuity effectively identified distal residues that influence catalysis, a longstanding challenge in protein engineering.







Abstract
Many applications of enzymes benefit from activity on structurally diverse substrates. Here, we sought to engineer the decarboxylative aldolase UstD to perform a challenging C&#8722;C bond forming reaction with ketone electrophiles. The parent enzyme had only low levels of activity, portending multiple rounds of directed evolution and a possibility that mutations may inadvertently increase the specificity of the enzyme for a single model screening substrate. We show how to intentionally guide UstD towards generality through multi&#8208;generational directed evolution using substrate&#8208;multiplexed screening (SUMS). Mutations outside of the active site that impact catalytic function were immediately revealed by shifts in promiscuity, even when the overall activity was lower. By re&#8208;targeting these distal residues that couple to the active site with saturation mutagenesis, broadly activating mutations were readily identified. When analyzing active site mutants, SUMS identified both specialist enzymes that would have more limited utility as well as generalist enzymes with complementary activity on diverse substrates. These new UstD enzymes catalyze convergent synthesis of non&#8208;canonical amino acids bearing tertiary alcohol side chains. This methodology is easy to implement and enables the rapid and effective evolution of enzymes to catalyze desirable new functions.

         <dc:description>
Engineering artificial allosteric protein switches controlled by rare earth elements allows the development of assays, construction of bioelectronic devices, and REE&#8208;controlled microorganisms.







Abstract
Lanthanides, which are part of the rare earth elements group have numerous applications in electronics, medicine and energy storage. However, our ability to extract them is not meeting the rapidly increasing demand. The discovery of the bacterial periplasmic lanthanide&#8208;binding protein lanmodulin spurred significant interest in developing biotechnological routes for lanthanide detection and extraction. Here we report the construction of &#946;&#8208;lactamase&#8208;lanmodulin chimeras that function as lanthanide&#8208;controlled enzymatic switches. Optimized switches demonstrated dynamic ranges approaching 3000&#8208;fold and could accurately quantify lanthanide ions in simple colorimetric or electrochemical assays. E.coli cells expressing such chimeras grow on &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotics only in the presence of lanthanide ions. The developed lanthanide&#8208;controlled protein switches represent a novel platform for engineering metal&#8208;binding proteins for biosensing and microbial engineering.

         <title>Rational Design Two&#8208; or Four&#8208;Electron Reaction Pathway Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient and Selective Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;electron reaction pathway covalent organic framework has been synthesized to boost H2O2 yield by replacing bipyridine N with biphenyl C atoms, which lowers the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step in the reduction of O2 to OOH* intermediates in oxygen reduction reaction process and achieves high faraday efficiency and highly selective hydrogen peroxide production.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are often employed in oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) for hydrogen peroxide production due to their tunable structures and compositions. However, COF electrocatalysts require precise structural engineering, such as heteroatoms or metal site doping, to modulate the reaction pathway during the ORR process. In this work, we designed a tetraphenyl&#8208;p&#8208;phenylenediamine based COF electrocatalyst, namely TPDA&#8208;BDA, which exhibited excellent two&#8208;electron (2e) ORR performance with high H2O2 selectivity of 89.7&#8201;% and faraday efficiency (FE) of 86.7&#8201;%, higher than the reported COFs to date for H2O2 electrosynthesis. The theoretical and experimental results showed that the rate&#8208;determining step energy barrier for reduction of O2 to OOH* intermediates was significantly reduced by replacing of bipyridine with biphenyl blocks, changing from 4e to 2e ORR reaction pathway. Also, the donor&#8208;acceptor characteristic and narrower optical band gap of TPDA&#8208;BDA COF enhanced the electronic conductivity and reduction ability, thus elevating the catalytic activity. As a result, the H2O2 selectivity was maintained above 85&#8201;% even after 50&#8197;h stability test. This work reveals the structure&#8208;property relationship of COF electrocatalysts and provides a new strategy for rational design of high performance 2e ORR COF electrocatalysts for efficient and selective hydrogen peroxide production.

         <title>Efficient Infrared&#8208;Detecting Organic Semiconductors Featuring a Tetraheterocyclic Core with Reduced Ionization Potential</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Infrared organic semiconductors are crucial in organic optoelectronics, yet high&#8208;performance materials with photoresponse beyond 1.1 &#956;m (the limit of crystalline silicon) remain scarce due to the limit of building blocks including strong electron&#8208;donating units. Here, we report an asymmetric tetraheterocycle (TPCT) with a reduced ionization potential of 6.18 eV relative to those reported dithiophene&#8208;based electron&#8208;donating blocks, and TPCT&#8208;2F and TPCTO&#8208;2F constructed with TPCT as the core exhibit absorption onset up to 1 &#956;m and 1.4 &#956;m, respectively. Especially, TPCTO&#8208;2F possesses a narrow bandgap of 1.00 eV and displays a small Urbach energy of 22.0 meV comparable to or even lower than those of some typical inorganic short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) semiconductors (13&#8211;44 meV). The organic photodetectors (OPDs) based on TPCT&#8208;2F achieve a peak detectivity (D*) of 2.2&#215;1013 Jones at 810 nm under zero bias, among the highest values for reported OPDs and on par with commercial silicon photodetectors. Impressively, TPCTO&#8208;2F&#8208;based OPDs demonstrate a wide response from 0.3 to 1.4 &#956;m and high D* comparable to germanium photodetector at wavelengths &lt;1.3 &#956;m with a maximum D* of 2.3&#215;1011 Jones at 1.06 &#956;m in SWIR region.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating the Spatially Folded Arrangement of Donor and Acceptor Units to Achieve Efficient Orange&#8208;Red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving efficient long&#8208;wavelength Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) remains a challenge due to the energy gap law, which leads to increased non&#8208;radiative decay rates. Herein, a strategy of constructing folded three&#8208;dimensional architectures is proposed to explore new orange&#8208;red thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters with through space charge transfer characteristics. Innovatively, naphthalene is selected as a bridge to connect O&#8208;bridged triphenylamine donor and planar dibenzo[a,c]phenazine acceptor respectively via simple Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Coupling. In this way, a series of rigid orange&#8208;red emitters with &#8220;U&#8221;&#8208;shaped, folded &#8220;Z&#8221;&#8208;shaped and &#8220;W&#8221;&#8208;shaped configurations are elaborately constructed by modifying end groups, adjusting the numbers of naphthalene and donor, and regulating the linkage sites. The excited state natures and photophysical properties of the emitters can be effectively regulated and optimized by changing three&#8208;dimensional architectures. Finally, the prepared emitter QX36 achieves a lower non&#8208;radiative transition rate, a higher radiative rate and a higher photoluminescence quantum efficiency. Solution&#8208;processed OLEDs based QX36 present the excellent electroluminescent performance with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of up to 32.3% and EQE of 20.6% at 1000 cd m&#8208;2, which are the leading values of solution&#8208;processed orange&#8208;red OLEDs. This work demonstrates the promising potential of folded TADF&#160;emitters for future efficient solution&#8208;processed long&#8208;wavelength OLEDs.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Discobahamin A and Putative Structure of Discobahamin B via an Isocyanide&#8208;based Macrocyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report in this paper the first total synthesis of discobahamin A, a 24&#8208;membered macrocyclopeptide containing an&#160;&#945;&#8208;keto amide functional group. We assign the absolute configuration of 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;methylpentanoic acid (Hmp), the side chain capping the N&#8208;terminus of the macrocycle, as the (2S, 3S) stereoisomer. A novel macrocyclization strategy was developed, utilizing&#160;an intramolecular Passerini reaction between&#160;&#969;&#8208;isocyano aldehyde and acetic acid. Notably, this macrocyclization proceeds&#160;via&#160;C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp2) bond formation and&#160;de novo&#160;generation of an&#160;a&#8208;keto amide functional group. Furthermore, we synthesized both the proposed structure of&#160;discobahamin B (5) and its diastereomer. However, the spectroscopic data for these two compounds do not fully align with those reported for discobahamin B (5).</dc:description>

         <title>Optimization of Structure&#8208;Guided Development of Chemical Probes for the Pseudoknot RNA of the Frameshift Element in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 frameshift element pseudoknot plays a crucial role in viral replication. Using various techniques, especially NMR spectroscopy and in&#8197;vitro frameshift assays, we have developed and optimized chemical probes that serve as fundamental structures for potential inhibitors targeting viral RNAs.







Abstract
Targeting the RNA genome of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 is a viable option for antiviral drug development. We explored three ligand binding sites of the core pseudoknot RNA of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 frameshift element. We iteratively optimized ligands, based on improved affinities, targeting these binding sites and report on structural and dynamic properties of the three identified binding sites. Available experimental 3D structures of the pseudoknot element were compared to SAXS and NMR data to validate its dominant folding state in solution. In order to experimentally map in&#8197;silico predicted binding sites, NMR assignments of the majority of nucleobases were achieved by segmental labeling of the pseudoknot RNA and isotope&#8208;filtered NMR experiments at 1.2&#8197;GHz, demonstrating the value of NMR spectroscopy to supplement modelling and docking data. Optimized ligands with enhanced affinity were shown to specifically inhibit frameshifting without affecting 0&#8208;frame translation in cell&#8208;free translation assays, establishing the frameshift element as target for drug&#8208;like ligands of low molecular weight.

         <title>All&#8208;in&#8208;One Photoacid Generators with Green/Red&#8208;light Responsiveness and Cooperative Functionality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PBI&#8208;PAG undergoes a quantitative (&gt;99&#8201;%) photoreaction to generate acid and photosensitizer (CBI) upon green/red light (560&#8197;nm&#8208;605&#8197;nm) excitation. Beyond respective roles as catalyst and PDT agent, the released acid and CBI sensitizer could cooperate in tumor anti&#8208;metastasis and ablation, granting PBI&#8208;PAG as a powerful molecular tool in inter&#8208;disciplinary applications.







Abstract
Photoacid generators (PAGs) are invaluable molecular tools that exhibited tremendous potential in emerging interdisciplinary researches of life&#8208;science, nanotechnology and smart materials. However, current PAGs are primarily mono&#8208;functional in terms of acid generation and rely on UV/deep&#8208;blue light excitation, posing a fundamental hurdle to their broader adoption. Developing cooperatively functioned PAGs with long&#8208;wavelength light responsiveness presents a formidable challenge due to the absence of suitable molecular scaffolds. Here, we introduce a newly&#8208;developed perylene bisimides PAG motif (PBI&#8208;PAG) that integrates desired multi&#8208;functionality and visible&#8208;light photo&#8208;reactivity. Taking advantages of characteristic opto&#8208;electronic properties of PBI scaffold, PBI&#8208;PAGs are capable of quantitative releasing (&gt;99&#8201;%) a palette of acids upon green/red light (560&#8211;605&#8197;nm) excitation. Concurrently, a photo&#8208;generated counterpart is functioned as a photo&#8208;sensitizer that could perform cooperatively with acid as an anti&#8208;metastasis cancer therapy agent. These two processes constitute the first example of a cooperatively functioned PAG operated at substrate&#8208;adaptive wavelengths.

         <title>Polymer Ligands with Multi&#8208;Nitrogen Heterocyclic Carbenes for Enhanced Stability and Reactivity in Nanoparticle Surface Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a method for effective surface functionalization of nanoparticles (NPs) utilizing block copolymers containing nitrogen heterocyclic carbenes blocks and poly(reactive ester) block. This approach enhances NPs&#8242; reactivity and stability, and is applicable to metal, metal oxide, and even rare&#8208;earth&#8208;doped upconversion NPs, thereby paving new pathways for the design and creation of nanoparticle&#8208;based functional materials.







Abstract
Nitrogen heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are emerging as effective substitutes for conventional thiol ligands in surface functionalization of nanoparticles (NPs), offering exceptional stability to NPs under harsh conditions. However, the highly reactive feature of NHCs limits their use in introducing chemically active groups onto the NP surface. Herein, we develop a general yet robust strategy for the efficient surface functionalization of NPs with copolymer ligands bearing various functional groups. The polymer ligands consist of a multiple NHCs block, utilized for surface binding on NPs, alongside a poly(reactive ester) block intended for incorporating functional groups. The multiple NHCs block enables NPs with excellent colloidal stability across a broader range of pH values (0&#8211;14), temperature variations (&#8211;78&#8201;&#176;C&#8208;100&#8201;&#176;C), and electrolyte concentrations (0&#8211;1000&#8197;mM). Through the in situ ammonolysis of the poly(reactive ester) block, various active functional groups can be individually or together introduced on the NP surface. We further demonstrate the chemical reactivity of these functionalized NPs, including addition polymerization, Diels&#8211;Alder and Schiff base reactions. This method is applicable to various types of NPs, including metal NPs, metal oxide NPs, and even upconversion NPs, thereby paving new pathways for the design and creation of nanoparticle&#8208;based functional materials.

Preparation of a thiophene&#8208;modified aromatic porous organic cage (T&#8208;PAC) with high stability for efficient high&#8208;capacity gold recovery. It's also used to selectively recover gold from a variety of complex aqueous solutions in a stable and efficient manner. The theoretical calculations and dedicated experiments suggest that anion&#8208;&#960; interactions between the [AuCl4]&#8722; and TFP fractions on T&#8208;PAC cooperated with S/N boning and redox effects play the decisive role for the highly efficient gold&#8208;recovery performance.







Abstract
High capacity, selective recovery and separation of precious metals from complex aqueous solutions is essential but remains a challenge in practical applications. Here, we prepared a thiophene&#8208;modified aromatic porous organic cage (T&#8208;PAC) with high stability for precise recognition and recovery of gold. T&#8208;PAC exhibits an outstanding gold uptake capacity of up to 2260&#8197;mg/g with fast adsorption kinetics and high adsorption selectivity. It's also used to selectively recover gold from a variety of complex aqueous solutions in a stable and efficient manner.

         <title>Harnessing Multi&#8208;Center&#8208;2&#8208;Electron Bonds for Carbene Metal&#8208;Hydride Nanocluster Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bottom&#8208;up approach leveraging preexisting m&#8208;center&#8208;n&#8208;electron (mc&#8208;ne) bonds enables the synthesis of a highly stable cyclic(alkyl)amino carbene (CAAC) copper&#8208;hydride nanocluster, [(CAAC)6Cu14H12][OTf]2. With superior stability to Stryker's reagent, DFT calculations attribute this stability to hydride&#8208;to&#8208;ligand backbonding with &#960;&#8208;accepting carbenes. This bench&#8208;stable cluster serves as an efficient and selective copper&#8208;hydride pre&#8208;catalyst in several catalytic applications.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands possess the ability to stabilize metal&#8208;based nanomaterials for a broad range of applications. With respect to metal&#8208;hydride nanomaterials, however, carbenes are rare, which is surprising if one considers the importance of metal&#8208;hydride bonds across the chemical sciences. In this study, we introduce a bottom&#8208;up approach that leverages preexisting metal&#8208;metal m&#8208;center&#8208;n&#8208;electron (mc&#8208;ne) bonds to access a highly stable cyclic(alkyl)amino carbene (CAAC) copper&#8208;hydride nanocluster, [(CAAC)6Cu14H12][OTf]2 with superior stability compared to Stryker's reagent, a popular commercial phosphine&#8208;based copper hydride catalyst. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the enhanced stability stems from hydride&#8208;to&#8208;ligand backbonding with the &#960;&#8208;accepting carbene. This new cluster emerges as an efficient and selective copper&#8208;hydride pre&#8208;catalyst, thereby providing a bench&#8208;stable alternative for catalytic applications.

This bench-stable cluster serves as an efficient and selective copper-hydride pre-catalyst in several catalytic applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands possess the ability to stabilize metal-based nanomaterials for a broad range of applications. With respect to metal-hydride nanomaterials, however, carbenes are rare, which is surprising if one considers the importance of metal-hydride bonds across the chemical sciences. In this study, we introduce a bottom-up approach that leverages preexisting metal-metal m-center-n-electron (&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;c-&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;e) bonds to access a highly stable cyclic(alkyl)amino carbene (CAAC) copper-hydride nanocluster, [(CAAC)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;][OTf]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with superior stability compared to Stryker's reagent, a popular commercial phosphine-based copper hydride catalyst. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the enhanced stability stems from hydride-to-ligand backbonding with the &#960;-accepting carbene. This new cluster emerges as an efficient and selective copper-hydride pre-catalyst, thereby providing a bench-stable alternative for catalytic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Guided Modulation of Li+ Solvation Structures towards Optimal Electrolyte Systems for High&#8208;Performance Li&#8722;O2 Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;solvent electrolyte has been successfully developed by aid of machine learning, which can show anion&#8208;induced ion&#8208;solvent&#8208;coordinated structures. As a result, a stable inorganic&#8208;rich SEI could be formed on anode, while large sized Li2O2 particles on cathode by regulating the growth pathway, enabling exceptional Li&#8722;O2 battery performance. These findings highlight the critical role of solvation structures and provide valuable theoretical guidance for rational design of next&#8208;generation electrolyte systems.







Abstract
As the &#8220;blood&#8221; of Li&#8722;O2 batteries (LOBs), electrolytes with various solvation structures of Li+ can greatly influence the composition of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on anode and the growth kinetics of Li2O2 on cathode, and further the battery performance. However, achieving delicate modulation of the multi&#8208;composition electrolytes remains significantly challenging to simultaneously give consideration to both the anode and cathode reactions. In this work, we employed Bayesian optimization to develop advanced electrolytes for LOBs, enabling the formation of a stable inorganic&#8208;rich SEI, and modulation of Li2O2 morphologies. Thus obtained LOBs using the optimized dual&#8208;solvent electrolyte could deliver a discharge capacity of 14,063&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 500&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is far higher than those using the single&#8208;solvent electrolytes. This study not only highlights the critical role of the solvation structure for improving the battery performance, but also provides new insights and important theoretical guidance for delicate modulation of electrolyte compositions.

         <title>Tiny&#8208;Ligand Solvation Electrolyte Enabled Fast&#8208;Charging Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report a guideline to fill this performance gap for designing tiny&#8208;ligand solvation electrolytes (TLSE) by using cosolvents with sterically hindered functional groups. The large&#8208;sized functional groups in the secondary solvation sheath weaken its solvation ability of oxygen atoms with Li+, thereby promoting H2O molecules to participate in the first Li+ solvation shell to form a fast ion&#8208;conduction tiny&#8208;ligand solvation.







Abstract
The H&#8208;bond network among H2O molecules enables ultrafast diffusion of H+ and OH&#8722; via a hopping mechanism, making aqueous batteries attractive competitors for next&#8208;generation fast&#8208;charging energy storages. Ideal aqueous electrolyte for the widely used lithium&#8208;ion batteries is expected to have the wide electrochemical stability window (&gt;5&#8197;volts), fast charging (&#8804;15&#8197;minutes) without gas evolution, and low cost. However, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) associated with narrow voltage window of water (1.23&#8197;V) limits their practical applications. Herein, we built a new guideline for designing tiny&#8208;ligand electrolytes by utilizing sterically hindered groups with low binding energy. Cosolvent tetraethyl orthocarbonate (TEOC), with large&#8208;sized ethoxy groups and hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;captured ability, forces free H2O and anion TFSI&#8722; into the Li+ first solvation shell. Hence, inhibition of HER takes place by means of immobilized H2O activity and formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks &#8212;C&#8722;O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H between TEOC and H2O. This unique structure with ultra&#8208;small sheath volume thereby facilitates the formation of LiF&#8208;rich SEI and fast ion&#8208;conduction. The lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) in TEOC/H2O electrolyte exhibits wide electrochemical window of 5.7&#8197;V, enabling LiMn2O4/Li4Ti5O12 pouch cells to achieve 1200 cycles under rapid 10&#8197;C rate. This engineering of tiny&#8208;ligand solvation opens new pathways for developing advanced electrolyte that balance performance with sustainability.

         <title>Switching CO2 Electroreduction toward C2+ Products and CH4 by Regulating the Dimerization and Protonation in Platinum/Copper Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed Pt modified Cu catalysts to effectively modulate the competitive coverage of those intermediates. The Pt single atoms and Pt nanoparticles modified Cu catalysts precisely regulated the protonation and dimerization, with C2+ FE reaching 70.4&#8201;% and CH4 FE reaching 57.7&#8201;%, respectively. We believe that our work could inspire new opportunities for designing and developing catalysts for highly selective and efficient reactions.







Abstract
Copper (Cu)&#8208;based catalysts exhibit distinctive performance in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) with complex mechanism and sophisticated types of products. The management of key intermediates *CO and *H is a necessary factor for achieving high product selectivity, but lack of efficient and versatile strategies. Herein, we designed Pt modified Cu catalysts to effectively modulate the competitive coverage of those intermediates. The Pt single&#8208;atoms and Pt nanoparticles modified Cu catalysts (denoted as Cu&#8208;Pt1 and Cu&#8208;PtNPs) precisely regulated the protonation and dimerization, with the faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ products up to 70.4&#8201;% and the FE of CH4 reaching 57.7&#8201;%, respectively. CO stripping experiments reveal that Pt1 sites could enhance the adsorption of *CO, while PtNPs exhibit *CO tolerance for H2O dissociation. In situ spectroscopic results further confirms that high coverage of *CO is achieved on Cu&#8208;Pt1, while *CHO on Cu&#8208;PtNPs might generate by additional water dissociation. As elucidated by theoretical studies, the interfacial sites of Cu&#8208;Pt1 would favor the *CO coverage promoting the evolution of *OCCO for C2+ products while PtNPs supplementarily accelerate H2O dissociation achieving *CHO for CH4. This work provides insights for efficient and targeted CO2 conversion by atomically design of active sites with engineered key intermediates coverage.

         <title>Accelerated Destruction of Passive Film and Microbial Corrosion of 316&#8197;L Stainless Steel via Extracellular Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accelerated microbial corrosion and destruction of passive film on stainless steel were caused by electroactive Shewanella oneidensis biofilm. The changes in surface properties were verified due to the accelerated electrochemical reactions mediated by extracellular electron transfer (EET). Cytochrome proteins and electron mediators accelerated EET process and redox reactions at the interface between electroactive bacterial biofilm and 316&#8197;L stainless steel.







Abstract
The dense passive film on 316&#8197;L stainless steel is the key in its corrosion resistance. Its interactions with an electroactive biofilm are critical in deciphering microbial corrosion. Herein, an in&#8208;depth investigation using genetic manipulations and addition of an exogenous electron mediator found that extracellular electron transfer (EET) mediated by the electroactive S. oneidensis biofilm grown aerobically accelerated the destruction of the microstructure and weakened the passive film. The changes in surface properties accelerated the electrochemical reactions and increased pitting corrosion. The redox state on the surface also changed due to the activity of the electroactive biofilm. A synergistic EET corrosion mechanism, including both direct and mediated electron transfer with passive film destruction was proposed to illustrate the corrosion caused by electroactive S. oneidensis. The techniques used in this work provide a systematic approach to probe EET impact on microbial corrosion by electroactive biofilms with electron transfer across the biotic&#8208;abiotic interfaces.

Herein, an in-depth investigation using genetic manipulations and addition of an exogenous electron mediator found that extracellular electron transfer (EET) mediated by the electroactive &lt;i&gt;S. oneidensis&lt;/i&gt; biofilm grown aerobically accelerated the destruction of the microstructure and weakened the passive film. The changes in surface properties accelerated the electrochemical reactions and increased pitting corrosion. The redox state on the surface also changed due to the activity of the electroactive biofilm. A synergistic EET corrosion mechanism, including both direct and mediated electron transfer with passive film destruction was proposed to illustrate the corrosion caused by electroactive &lt;i&gt;S. oneidensis&lt;/i&gt;. The techniques used in this work provide a systematic approach to probe EET impact on microbial corrosion by electroactive biofilms with electron transfer across the biotic-abiotic interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Precise Identification of Native Peptides with Posttranslational Proline Hydroxylation by Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rationally engineered nanopore was constructed to directly discriminate posttranslational proline hydroxylation in native peptides. By modeling the specific binding structure, hydrophobic region was introduced into aerolysin to transduce the hydrophobicity difference induced by hydroxylation. Precise identification of proline hydroxylation in hypoxia&#8208;induced factor protein was achieved without interference from adjacent oxidation.







Abstract
Hydroxylation, an extensive post&#8208;translational modification on proline, is critical for the modulation of native protein structures, further dominating their functions in life systems. However, current mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based identification, could hardly distinguish hydroxylation with the neighboring oxidation due to the same mass shifts, as well as challenges posed by low abundance and exogenous oxidation during sample preparation. To address this, an engineered nanopore was designed, capable of discriminating single hydroxyl group on proline, to achieve the identification of proline hydroxylation on individual native peptides directly in mixture. By modeling the interaction between hydroxylated proline and its specific recognition protein, we introduced a hydrophobic region in aerolysin lumen with A224Y/T274W mutations to enhance the sensitivity for proline residue. The results showed that the proline hydroxylation on native HIF&#8208;1&#945; fragments could be unambiguously identified without purification, which could be maintained even in the presence of neighboring oxidation. The voltage&#8208;dependent experiments further demonstrated the more relaxed peptide structure induced by hydroxylation that supported the great impact of hydroxylation on chemical properties of proline and the molecular mechanism of the specific recognition for hydroxylated proline in nature. These findings highlight the potential of nanopore for precise hydroxylation detection, offering a reliable platform for further uncovering the related functions in biological systems.

         <title>Photochromic Color Tuning of Copper&#8208;Doped Zinc Sulfide Nanocrystals by Control of Local Dopant Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study achieved tunable photochromic colors (gray to brown) in Cu&#8208;doped ZnS nanocrystals by controlling surface Zn and S stoichiometry using thiol and non&#8208;thiol ligands. Experiments and quantum chemical calculations revealed that Cu distribution on Zn&#8208;rich or S&#8208;rich surfaces determines color, with minimal influence from particle size or Cu concentration.







Abstract
Inorganic photochromic materials offer several advantages over organic compounds, including relatively inexpensive and higher thermal stability. However, tuning their color with the same component has remained a significant challenge. In this study, we demonstrate that the photochromic color of Cu&#8208;doped ZnS nanocrystals (NCs), which is initially pale yellow before light irradiation, can be tuned from gray to brown by adjusting the surface stoichiometry of Zn and S, which is controlled through the use of thiol and non&#8208;thiol ligands. Several experiments and quantum chemical calculations using model clusters revealed that the color change is determined by the distribution of Cu, which significantly contributes to the coloration, specifically whether it resides on the Zn&#8208;rich or S&#8208;rich surface. In contrast, particle size and Cu concentration were found to have little effect on the photochromic color. This study expands the diversity of photochromic responses in inorganic NCs and marks an important step toward the development of further advanced photochromic nanomaterials.

         <title>A Robust Dual&#8208;Layered Solid Electrolyte Interphase Enabled by Cation Specific Adsorption&#8208;Induced Built&#8208;In Electrostatic Field for Long&#8208;Cycling Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust dual&#8208;layered solid electrolyte interphase is constructed through a cation specific adsorption&#8208;induced built&#8208;in electrostatic field. This dual&#8208;layered SEI consists of a mechanically flexible organic&#8208;rich surface layer and a rigid, conductive inorganic&#8208;rich bottom layer, which together effectively accommodate stress and strain while inhibiting Li dendrite formation during repeated Li plating and stripping.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium (Li) metal batteries (SSLMBs) are considered as one of the most promising next&#8208;generation battery technologies due to their high energy density and intrinsic safety. However, interfacial issues such as side reactions and Li dendrite growth severely hinder the practical application of SSLMBs. In this contribution, we proposed a cationic built&#8208;in electrostatic field to drive the generation of an anion&#8208;derived dual&#8208;layered solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The specific adsorption of tributylmethyl&#8208;phosphonium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TMPB) cations onto negatively charged Li anode surface significantly prevents interfacial side reactions between vulnerable polyethylene oxide (PEO) and Li metal. More importantly, the formed cationic built&#8208;in electrostatic field induces the targeted trapping of Li&#8208;salt anions onto the Li metal surface, leading to the generation of an anion&#8208;derived dual&#8208;layered SEI, composed of a mechanically flexible organic&#8208;rich surface layer and a Li&#8208;ion conductive inorganic&#8208;rich bottom layer. As a result, the Li||Li cell demonstrated an extended lifespan of over 1900&#8197;hours with the reduced polarization voltage. The Li||LiFePO4 full cell also exhibited excellent cycling stability, maintaining an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.7&#8201;% over 200 cycles at 0.5&#8197;C. This work provides valuable insights into mitigating interfacial degradation and promoting uniform Li deposition through surface electrostatic field regulation.

         <title>Antimicrobial Phenolic Materials: From Assembly to Function</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural polyphenols, primarily found in plants, can possess antimicrobial properties and have therefore been exploited widely. This review examines the antimicrobial mechanisms of polyphenols and their development into antimicrobial materials, including as particles, hydrogels, coatings and macroscopic structures. These materials hold potential for antimicrobial applications, ranging from wound healing to oral health, and offer a promising therapeutic strategy for combating and reducing the transmission of bacterial infections.







Abstract
Infectious diseases pose considerable challenges to public health, particularly with the rise of multidrug&#8208;resistant pathogens that globally cause high mortality rates. These pathogens can persist on surfaces and spread in public and healthcare settings. Advances have been made in developing antimicrobial materials to reduce the transmission of pathogens, including materials composed of naturally sourced polyphenols and their derivatives, which exhibit antimicrobial potency, broad&#8208;spectrum activity, and a lower likelihood of promoting resistance. This review provides an overview of recent advances in the fabrication of antimicrobial phenolic biomaterials, where natural phenolic compounds act as active antimicrobial agents or encapsulate other antimicrobial agents (e.g., metal ions, antimicrobial peptides, natural biopolymers). Various forms of phenolic biomaterials synthesized through these two strategies, including antimicrobial particles, capsules, hydrogels, and coatings, are summarized, with a focus on their application in wound healing, bone repair and regeneration, oral health, and antimicrobial coatings for medical devices. The potential of these advanced phenolic biomaterials provides a promising therapeutic approach for combating antimicrobial&#8208;resistant infections and reducing microbial transmission.

         <title>Distinct Valence States of the [4Fe4S] Cluster Revealed in the Hydrogenase CrHydA1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the apo&#8208;form of FeFe&#8208;hydrogenase from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii two different paramagnetic states arise from a single iron&#8208;sulfur cluster. EPR experiments found them to interconvert based on redox&#8208;potentials and pH&#8208;levels. Computational methods attribute this to secondary&#8208;sphere residues adopting distinct conformations around the cluster.







Abstract
Iron&#8208;sulfur clusters play a crucial role in electron transfer for many essential enzymes, including [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases. This study focuses on the [4Fe4S] cluster ([4Fe]H) of the minimal [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CrHydA1) and employs advanced spectroscopy, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, molecular dynamics simulations, and QM/MM calculations. We provide insights into the complex electronic structure of [4Fe]H and its role in the catalytic reaction of CrHydA1, serving as paradigm for understanding [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases. We identified at least two distinct species within the apo&#8208;form of CrHydA1, designated 4Fe&#8722;R and 4Fe&#8722;A, with unique redox potentials and pH sensitivities. Our findings revealed that these species arise from a complex interplay of structural heterogeneity and valence isomer rearrangements, influenced by second&#8208;sphere residues. We propose that the interconversion between 4Fe&#8722;R and 4Fe&#8722;A could provide control over electron transfer in the absence of accessory FeS clusters typically found in other [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases. The insights gained from this study not only enhance our understanding of [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases but also provide a crucial foundation for future investigations into analysis of other FeS clusters across diverse biological systems.

&lt;p&gt;Iron-sulfur clusters play a crucial role in electron transfer for many essential enzymes, including [FeFe]-hydrogenases. This study focuses on the [4Fe4S] cluster ([4Fe]&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;) of the minimal [FeFe]-hydrogenase from &lt;i&gt;Chlamydomonas reinhardtii&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Cr&lt;/i&gt;HydA1) and employs advanced spectroscopy, site-directed mutagenesis, molecular dynamics simulations, and QM/MM calculations. We provide insights into the complex electronic structure of [4Fe]&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; and its role in the catalytic reaction of &lt;i&gt;Cr&lt;/i&gt;HydA1, serving as paradigm for understanding [FeFe]-hydrogenases. We identified at least two distinct species within the apo-form of &lt;i&gt;Cr&lt;/i&gt;HydA1, designated 4Fe&#8722;R and 4Fe&#8722;A, with unique redox potentials and pH sensitivities. Our findings revealed that these species arise from a complex interplay of structural heterogeneity and valence isomer rearrangements, influenced by second-sphere residues. We propose that the interconversion between 4Fe&#8722;R and 4Fe&#8722;A could provide control over electron transfer in the absence of accessory FeS clusters typically found in other [FeFe]-hydrogenases. The insights gained from this study not only enhance our understanding of [FeFe]-hydrogenases but also provide a crucial foundation for future investigations into analysis of other FeS clusters across diverse biological systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Force&#8208;Trainable Liquid Crystal Elastomer Enabled by Mechanophore&#8208;Induced Radical Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have showed an example for active smart materials that can exchange substances with the surroundings to gain the training &amp; learning capability enabled by covalently integrating a mechanophore tetraarylsuccinonitrile in the main chain of a single&#8208;network liquid crystal elastomer (LCE). After being trained in different &#8220;learning intermediates&#8221;, additional polymer chains grafted to the original liquid crystal networks form through the mechano&#8208;radical induced polymerization. As a result, the LCE can improve the actuation performance and learn new functions that it does not intrinsically have, which is determined by the characteristics of the &#8220;learning intermediates&#8221;.







Abstract
In nature, organisms adapt to environmental changes through training to learn new abilities, offering valuable insights for developing intelligent materials. However, replicating this &#8220;adaptive learning&#8221; in synthetic materials presents a significant challenge. This study introduces a feasible approach to train liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) by integrating a mechanophore tetraarylsuccinonitrile into their main chain, addressing the challenge of enabling synthetic materials to exchange substances with their environment. Inspired by biological training, the LCEs can self&#8208;strengthen and acquire new functionalities through mechanical stress&#8208;induced radical polymerization. The research not only enhances the mechanical performance of LCEs, but also endows them with the ability to learn properties such as flexibility, light responsiveness, and fluorescence. These advancements are crucial for overcoming the limitations of current materials, paving the way for the creation of advanced intelligent soft materials with autonomous self&#8208;improvement, akin to the adaptive skills of living organisms.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Multicatalytic Decarbonylation of Aldehydes Driven by Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;for&#8208;one decarbonylation: two metal&#8208;free multicatalytic decarbonylation processes of either secondary or tertiary aliphatic aldehydes are reported for the first time. The mild reaction conditions are compatible with various functionalities and applied to complex molecules. Importantly, these processes are orthogonal and allow the selective decarbonylation of mixtures of aldehydes.







Abstract
A metal&#8208;free dual photo&#8208; and organocatalytic decarbonylation of aliphatic aldehydes is described for the first time. On the one hand, a wide range of tertiary aldehydes are smoothly decarbonylated thanks to the combination of thioxanthone as photocatalyst and diphenyl disulfide as organocatalyst. On the other hand, by simply using 4&#8208;CzIPN as photocatalyst instead of thioxanthone, various secondary aldehydes readily undergo decarbonylation in an orthogonal manner, via the in situ formation of 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines. Both methodologies are compatible with various functional groups and are readily applied to the decarbonylation of complex molecules.

         <title>COF&#8208;Assisted Construction of Steric Mass&#8208;Charge Channels to Boost Activity for High&#8208;Performance Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To reduce the mass transport resistance ascribed to the stacking issues when assembling catalysts into membrane electrode assembly of fuel cells, the steric mass&#8208;charge channels are constructed by implanting porous and rigid sulfonated covalent organic frameworks into the catalytic layer, stimulating the catalytic activity and boosting the device performance for electrocatalysis.







Abstract
The two&#8208;dimensional lamellar materials disperse platinum sites and minimize noble&#8208;metal usage for fuel cells, while mass transport resistance at the stacked layers spurs device failure with a significant performance decline in membrane electrode assembly (MEA). Herein, we implant porous and rigid sulfonated covalent organic frameworks (COF) into the graphene&#8208;based catalytic layer for the construction of steric mass&#8208;charge channels, which highly facilitates the activity of oxygen reduction reactions in both the rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements and MEA device tests. Specifically, the normalized mass activity is remarkably boosted by 3.7&#8197;times to 1.56&#8197;A&#8201;mgpt&#8722;1 after additions of suitable COF modifications in the RDE tests. Especially, an excellent maximum power density of 1.015&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is realized on the MEA in H2/Air condition, representing a 22&#8201;% improvement through such constructions of steric mass&#8208;charge channels. Meanwhile, the open&#8208;circuit voltage of fuel cells demonstrates only 0.8&#8201;% reductions after 10,000 cycles of stability tests. We further extended such methodology of constructing mass&#8208;charge channels to granular PtCo and commercial Pt/C catalysts, which demonstrates a significant impetus for stimulating the catalytic activity in fuel cells.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Aqueous Electrolyte Induced Formation of Water&#8208;Poor Zn2+ Solvation Structures and Gradient Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase for Long&#8208;Life Zn&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new high&#8208;entropy aqueous electrolyte is developed by introducing multiple solutes and solvents. The well&#8208;designed high&#8208;entropy electrolyte reduces the content of solvated water molecules and free water while forming a robust gradient solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase protective layer and a cationic electrostatic shielding layer on the Zn anode, which can effectively mitigate the corrosion of the Zn anode and promote uniform deposition of Zn.







Abstract
Electrolyte engineering has emerged as an effective strategy for stabilizing Zn&#8208;metal anodes. However, a single solute or solvent additive is far from sufficient to meet the requirements for electrolyte cycling stability. Here, we report a new&#8208;type high&#8208;entropy electrolyte composed of equal molar amounts of Zn(OTf)2 and LiOTf, along with equal volumes of H2O, triethyl phosphate, and dimethyl sulfoxide, which enhances electrolyte stability by increasing solvation entropy. Specifically, this well&#8208;designed high&#8208;entropy electrolyte reduces the content of solvated and free water molecules while forming a robust gradient solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase on the Zn anode surface, protecting the Zn anode from water&#8208;induced corrosion. Moreover, the cationic electrostatic shielding layer on the Zn anode effectively suppresses the &#8220;tip effect&#8221;, enabling the uniform deposition of Zn. The synergistic effects of this mixed electrolyte effectively leverage the properties of individual additives, significantly extending the cycle life of Zn&#8208;metal anodes. Consequently, the resulting Zn//Zn symmetric cell using this high&#8208;entropy electrolyte can operate over 8000&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 0.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. To highlight, in a Zn//V2O5&#8901;H2O pouch cell, it retains 83.1&#8201;% of initial capacity after 420 cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Such multifunctional high&#8208;entropy electrolyte design provides a meaningful reference for stable Zn&#8208;metal anodes.

         <title>Manipulating Interphase Chemistry for Aqueous Zn Stabilization: The Role of Supersaturation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We highlight the role of local supersaturation in governing the fundamental crystallization chemistry of Zn4SO4(OH)6&#8901;xH2O (ZSH) and propose a subtle supersaturation&#8208;controlled morphology strategy to tailor the interphase chemistry of Zn anode. Attributed to the supersaturated environment created by caprolactam, ZSH selectively exposes high&#8208;energy (001) plane and initiates a pseudo&#8208;coincidence interface that significantly boosts the Zn lifespan.







Abstract
The limited cycling durability of Zn anode, attributed to the absence of a robust electrolyte&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), remains the bottleneck for the practical deployment of aqueous zinc batteries. Herein, we highlight the role of local supersaturation in governing the fundamental crystallization chemistry of Zn4SO4(OH)6&#8901;xH2O (ZSH) and propose a subtle supersaturation&#8208;controlled morphology strategy to tailor the interphase chemistry of Zn anode. By judiciously creating local high&#8208;supersaturation environment with organic caprolactam to manipulate the precipitation manner of zinc sulfate hydroxide (ZSH), lattice&#8208;lattice matched heterogeneous nucleation of ZSH (001) and Zn (002) is realized in aqueous ZnSO4, producing a dense, pseudo&#8208;coincidence interface capable of functioning as decent SEI. The plating/stripping efficacy of Zn is significantly boosted, as reflected by the great improvement of the initial (from 59.9&#8201;% to 84.1&#8201;%) and average (from 94.0&#8201;% to 99.2&#8201;%) coulombic efficiency. Accordingly, the cyclic endurance of Zn anode is prolonged from 50&#8197;h to over 7000&#8197;h at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, witnessing 140&#8208;fold lifespan extension. Profiting from supersaturation&#8208;mediated Zn stabilization, the performance deterioration of zinc&#8208;vanadium batteries is also alleviated, even with a low N/P ratio of 4.4. This work is anticipated to deepen current understanding on the control of the anodic chemistry.

         <title>Paired Photoproduction of H2O2 and 3,4&#8208;Dihydroisoquinoline Over Covalent Pyrene&#8208;(Thio)urea Frameworks with Electron Push&#8208;Pull Effect</title>

         <dc:description>
Two novel crystalline pyrene&#8208;thiourea/urea covalent organic frameworks (COF&#8722;Py&#8722;S and &#8722;O) with electron push&#8208;pull effect were successfully synthesized and served as efficient paired photosynthesis catalysts of H2O2 and 3,4&#8208;dihydroisoquinoline (DHIQ) products. COF&#8722;Py&#8722;S exhibited higher 2e&#8722; ORR to H2O2 yield rate of ~19&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible light, with higher THIQ&#8208;SDR conversion (~100&#8201;%) and DHIQ selectivity.







Abstract
Pairing photocatalytic 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroisoquinoline semi&#8208;dehydrogenation reaction (THIQ&#8208;SDR) with two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) is a green solar to chemical strategy by simultaneously utilizing the photo&#8208;excited electrons and holes. However, it is still short of high&#8208;efficiency photocatalyst to drive two reactions above. In the present work, crystalline pyrene&#8208;thiourea/urea covalent organic frameworks (COF&#8722;Py&#8722;S and &#8722;O) were synthesized and demonstrated as high&#8208;performance metal&#8208;free photocatalysts. In particular, COF&#8722;Py&#8722;S exhibited higher 2e&#8722; ORR to H2O2 yield rate of ~19&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible light and finally solid H2O2 products (Na2CO3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1.5H2O2) was collected after long&#8208;time irradiation. Under natural sunlight conditions, the H2O2 production rate over COF&#8722;Py&#8722;S further increased to ~51&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, among the best COF photocatalysts. COF&#8722;Py&#8722;S also showed high THIQ&#8208;SDR conversion (~100&#8201;%) with 3,4&#8208;dihydroisoquinoline (DHIQ) selectivity of ~92&#8201;%. Theoretical calculations reveal stronger electron push&#8208;pull effect of COF&#8722;Py&#8722;S than COF&#8722;Py&#8722;O, enhancing its photoinduced charge carries, and a four&#8208;step 2e&#8722; ORR mechanism with thiourea as the active sites has been confirmed as well as the mechanism of THIQ&#8208;SDR to DHIQ, featuring lower energy barriers for O2 adsorption and *HOOH desorption over thiourea units. This work provides a paired photosynthesis strategy of H2O2 and DHIQ over high&#8208;efficiency pyrene&#8208;(thio)urea COF photocatalysts with electron push&#8208;pull effect.

         <title>Super Strong Bonding at the Interface between ETL and Perovskite for Robust Flexible Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskites have great potential in flexible optoelectronic devices. A multifunctional organic salt, 4&#8208;(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazine hydrochloride (TPH), is applied to enhance the interface between the SnO2 electron transport layer (ETL) and perovskite layer through two&#8208;site bonding, and accelerates the nucleation rate of perovskite. The flexible perovskite solar cells retained 92.3&#8201;% of the original efficiency after bending 25,000 cycles.







Abstract
Organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites have demonstrated great potential for flexible optoelectronic devices due to their superior optoelectronic properties and structural flexibility. However, mechanical deformation&#8208;induced cracks at the buried interface and delamination from the substrate severely constrain the optoelectronic performance and device lifespan. Here, we design a two&#8208;site bonding strategy aiming to reinforce the mechanical stability of the SnO2/perovskite interface and perovskite layer using a multifunctional organic salt, 4&#8208;(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazine hydrochloride (TPH). This approach significantly enhances the bonding at the buried interface between the electron transport layer and perovskite layer, which is demonstrated by TPH&#8208;modified SnO2/perovskite interface remaining intact after 10,000 bending cycles. Meanwhile, TPH mitigates void formation, enhances perovskite crystallinity at the buried interface, and inhibits ion migration inside the devices. Furthermore, incorporating TPH in perovskite bulk decreases the nucleation activation energy and accelerates nucleation, leading to high&#8208;quality perovskite film. Consequently, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 21.64&#8201;% and 23.61&#8201;% are achieved for target flexible and rigid perovskite solar cells, respectively. The target flexible device retained 92.3&#8201;% of its initial PCE after 25,000 bending cycles. This approach provides a robust solution for enhancing the mechanical durability of flexible perovskite optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Electrochemical Cyclopropanation of Unactivated Alkenes with Methylene Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and efficient method for the organo&#8208;mediated electrooxidative cyclopropanation of unactivated alkenes with methylene compounds has been developed. The method shows excellent functional group tolerance and a broad substrate scope that can be extended to late&#8208;stage modification of biorelevant compounds.







Abstract
Cyclopropanes are prevalent in natural products, pharmaceuticals, and bioactive compounds, functioning as a significant structural motif. Although a series of methods have been developed for the construction of the cyclopropane skeleton, the development of a direct and efficient strategy for the rapid synthesis of cyclopropanes from bench&#8208;stable starting materials with a broad substrate scope and functional group tolerance remains challenging and highly desirable. Herein, we present an electrochemical method for the direct cyclopropanation of unactivated alkenes using active methylene compounds. The strategy shows a broad substrate scope with a high level of functional group compatibility, as well as potential application as demonstrated by late&#8208;stage cyclopropanation of complex molecules and drug derivatives. Further mechanistic investigations suggest that Cp2Fe (Fc) plays an essential role as an oxidative mediator in generating radicals from active methylene compounds.

The figure&#8208;eight frameworks are brilliant light emitters, convert &#960; columns into water oxidation and oxygen reduction centers, and produce H2O2 efficiently with water/salt water, oxygen/air, and light as sole inputs, opening a novel way to framework and well&#8208;defined figure&#8208;eight materials.







Abstract
Figure&#8208;eight macrocycles represent a fascinating class of &#960;&#8208;conjugated units characterized by unique aesthetics and non&#8208;contact molecular crossing at the center. Despite progress in synthesis over the past century, research into inorganic, organic, and polymeric figure&#8208;eight materials remains in its infancy. Here we report the first examples of figure&#8208;eight covalent organic frameworks by condensing figure&#8208;eight knots to create extended porous figure&#8208;eight &#960; architectures. A distinct feature is that polymerization interweaves figure&#8208;eight knots into double&#8208;decker layers, which upon supramolecular polymerization organize well&#8208;defined layer frameworks. The figure&#8208;eight frameworks exhibit a band gap of 2.3&#8197;eV and emit bright orange florescence with benchmark quantum yields. Remarkably, the donor&#8208;acceptor figure&#8208;eight skeletons convert the figure&#8208;eight knots into reduction centers and the linkers into oxidation sites upon light irradiation, enable charge transport and accumulation through &#960; columns, while the built&#8208;in hydrophilic micropores allow rapid water and oxygen delivery via capillary effect. With these distinct features, the figure&#8208;eight frameworks function as a photocatalyst to produce hydrogen peroxide at high rate and efficiency with water/saltwater, oxygen/air, and light as sole inputs. This work paves a way to a new class of molecular frameworks, underpinning the study of well&#8208;defined figure&#8208;eight materials to explore unprecedented structures and functions so far we untouched.

A refined site&#8208;specific anisotropic assembly and etching co&#8208;mediation approach was fabricated to create a series of hierarchical MOF nanohybrids and single&#8208;crystal MOFs. This approach yields ZIF&#8208;8&amp;mSiO2 nanohybrids with diverse topologies, alongside derived single&#8208;crystal MOF nanoparticles exhibiting intricate morphologies such as hexapods, nested nanocages, and octopods.







Abstract
The synthesis of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with diverse geometries has captivated considerable interest due to their manifestation of novel and extraordinary properties. While much progress has been made in shaping regular polyhedral single&#8208;crystal MOFs, the creation of more complex, topologically intricate nanostructures remains a largely unexplored frontier. Here, we present a refined site&#8208;specific anisotropic assembly and etching co&#8208;mediation approach to fabricate a series of hierarchical MOF nanohybrids and single&#8208;crystal MOFs. This approach yields ZIF&#8208;8&amp;mSiO2 nanohybrids with diverse topologies, alongside derived single&#8208;crystal MOF nanoparticles exhibiting intricate morphologies such as hexapods, nested nanocages, and octopods. Our method involves the selective growth of six mSiO2 nanoplates on the {100} facets of ZIF&#8208;8 nanocubes, forming the cubic&#8208;shaped ZIF&#8208;8&amp;mSiO2 nanohybrids, with the concurrent etching of the {110} facets of initial ZIF&#8208;8 nanocubes. By fine&#8208;tuning this balance between the growth and etching, we achieved precise morphological control, transforming cubic nanohybrids into intricate hexapods nanohybrids. Additionally, secondary epitaxial growth of homo&#8208; or hetero&#8208;MOFs on these hybrids led to ZIF&#8208;8&amp;mSiO2&amp;MOF composites with six mSiO2 inlays. Finally, selective alkaline etching of the mSiO2 compartments result in single&#8208;crystal MOF nanoparticles with unprecedented and sophisticated morphologies, such as hexapods, nested nanocages, octopods. This work advances the field of MOF nanostructure design, opening new avenues for the development of sophisticated, multifunctional materials.

         <title>CO2&#8208;Assisted Controllable Synthesis of PdNi Nanoalloys for Highly Selective Hydrogenation of Biomass&#8208;Derived 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly selective and stable Pd2Ni1/SBA&#8208;15 nanoalloy catalyst has been prepared using a solvent&#8208;free CO2&#8208;assisted method for the hydrogenation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural. A striking volcano&#8208;like trend was observed between activity and the Pd/Ni ratio, with 2,5&#8208;bishydroxymethyltetrahydrofuran yield surpassing most previously reported catalysts. Alloying Pd with Ni and the formation of Pd&#948;&#8722;&#8722;Ni&#948;+ pairs significantly enhance catalytic performance.







Abstract
The selective hydrogenation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;bishydroxymethyltetrahydrofuran (BHMTHF), a vital fuel precursor and solvent, is crucial for biomass refining. Herein, we report highly selective and stable PdNi nanoalloy catalysts for this deep hydrogenation process. A CO2&#8208;assisted green method was developed for the controllable synthesis of various bimetallic and monometallic catalysts. The PdNi/SBA&#8208;15 catalysts with various Pd/Ni ratios exhibited a volcano&#8208;like trend between BHMTHF yield and Pd/Ni ratio. Among all catalysts tested, Pd2Ni1/SBA&#8208;15 achieved the best performance, converting 99.0&#8201;% of HMF to BHMTHF with 96.0&#8201;% selectivity, surpassing previously reported catalysts. Additionally, the Pd2Ni1/SBA&#8208;15 catalyst maintained excellent stability even after five recycling runs. Catalyst characterizations (e.&#8201;g., HAADF&#8208;STEM) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed the successful formation of the alloy structure with electron transfer between Ni and Pd, which accounts for the remarkable performance and stability of the catalyst. This work paves the way for developing highly selective and stable alloy catalysts for biomass valorization.

         <title>Synthesis of Low&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Fucoidan Analogue and Its Inhibitory Activities against Heparanase and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Infection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The purpose&#8208;designed low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight fucoidan analogue exhibited anti&#8208;heparanase activity even in the cell&#8208;based assay. In addition, the analogue inhibited the binding between SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;S) and heparin and between SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;S and angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Furthermore, the analogue effectively inhibited infection by the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Wuhan strain and two Omicron subvariants.







Abstract
Heparan sulfate (HS) is ubiquitous on cell surfaces and is used as a receptor by many viruses including SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. However, increased activity of the inflammatory enzyme heparanase (HPSE), which hydrolyses HS, in patients with COVID&#8208;19 not only increases the severity of symptoms but also may facilitate the spread of the virus by degrading HS on the cell surface. Therefore, synthetic HPSE blockades, which can bind to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;S) and inhibit viral entry, have attracted much attention. This study investigated the development of a new dual&#8208;targeting antiviral agent against HPSE and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;S using fucoidan as a structural motif. It was found that all&#8208;sulfated fucoidan derivative 10, which exhibited the highest binding affinity to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;S among 13 derivatives, also showed the highest inhibitory activity against HPSE. Based on this, a newly designed and synthesized fucoidan analogue 16, in which the octyl group of 10 was changed to a cholestanyl group, was found to show approximately 3 times higher activity than 10 but did not inhibit factor Xa associated with undesired anticoagulant effects. The binding affinity of 16 to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;S was significantly increased approximately 400&#8208;fold over that of 10. The binding of 16 to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;S inhibited the binding between SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;S and heparin and between SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;S and ACE2. Furthermore, 16 effectively inhibited infection by the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Wuhan strain and two Omicron subvariants.

Localised oxidative catalytic reactions triggered by cavitation bubbles confinement on copper oxide microstructured particles.We exploit here a concept of CuO particle design with multiple gas&#8208;stabilizing sites, engineered to function as cavitation nuclei and catalysts. This concept facilitates selective and localised acoustic energy transfer directly to the catalyst surface, minimising the undesired dissipation of acoustic energy into the bulk solution while demonstrating superior cavitation properties at lower acoustic pressure amplitudes towards catalytic oxidative reactions.







Abstract
Efficient energy transfer management in catalytic processes is crucial for overcoming activation energy barriers while minimizing costs and CO2 emissions. We exploit here a concept of CuO particle design with multiple gas&#8208;stabilizing sites, engineered to function as cavitation nuclei and catalysts. This concept facilitates the selective and efficient acoustic energy transfer directly to the catalyst surface, avoiding the undesired dissipation of acoustic energy into the bulk solution while demonstrating superior cavitation properties at lower acoustic pressure amplitudes. Utilizing a chemical thermometric approach, we demonstrate that the local temperature on the surface of our CuO particles during cavitation bubble implosions can create an effective equivalent temperature of about 360&#8201;&#176;C. This temperature effect facilitates the efficient catalysis of oxidative reactions using an organic pollutant probe molecule. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to assess the decomposition of H2O2 and of pollutant probe molecule on CuO (111). Our work represents a significant advance in sonocatalytic systems, promising efficient energy use in catalytic reactions.

         <title>Revealing Intrinsic Free Charge Generation: Promoting the Construction of Over 19% Efficient Planar p&#8208;n Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Revealing the organic semiconductors with specific three&#8208;dimensional tightly stacking and Donor/Acceptor conjugation characteristics can generate intrinsic free charge directly. Hence, we obtain the new efficiency record for planar p&#8208;n heterojunction organic solar cells with excellent stability under various stresses. This will completely change the development of organic photovoltaics and pave a new path for their industrial development.







Abstract
Due to high binding energy and extremely short diffusion distance of Frenkel excitons in common organic semiconductors at early stage, mechanism of interface charge transfer&#8208;mediated free carrier generation has dominated the development of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs). However, considering the advancements in materials and device performance, it is necessary to reexamine the photoelectric conversion in current&#8208;stage efficient OSCs. Here, we propose that the conjugated materials with specific three&#8208;dimensional donor&#8208;acceptor conjugated packing potentially exhibit distinctive charge photogeneration mechanism, which spontaneously split Wannier&#8208;Mott excitons to free carriers in pure phases. Subsequently, the pure planar p&#8208;n heterojunction (PHJ) OSCs based on green orthogonal solvents were prepared and exhibited comparable even greater performance to that of BHJ OSCs. More interestingly, by introducing PVDF&#8208;TrFE as intrinsic region to regulate built&#8208;in electric field of the device, the planar p&#8208;i&#8208;n PHJ OSCs achieved much higher efficiency (&gt;18%) and stability. Moreover, a prominent efficiency of over 19% has been obtained via ternary optimization, which is the new efficiency record for PHJ OSCs up to date. This study points towards the distinguishing intrinsic free charge generation mechanism, opens up a new avenue for OSCs to collectively realize high&#8208;efficiency, long&#8208;term duration, and simplified device engineering for future commercialization.

         <title>Programming the Dynamic Range of Nanochannel Biosensors for MicroRNA Detection Through Allosteric DNA Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Allosteric DNA probes were utilized to systematically adjust the dynamic range of nanochannel biosensors, resulting in a collection of sensors with notably diverse target affinities. The dynamic range was significantly extended to 10,900&#8208;fold by combining probes with varying affinities. Additionally, the effective dynamic range of the nanochannel biosensor was narrowed to just a 3&#8208;fold range by employing a sequestration mechanism.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state nanochannel biosensors are extensively utilized for microRNA (miRNA) detection owing to their high sensitivity and rapid response. However, conventional nanochannel biosensors face limitations in their fixed dynamic range, restricting their versatility and efficacy. Herein, we introduce tunable triblock DNA probes with varying affinities for target miRNA to engineer solid&#8208;state nanochannel biosensors capable of customizable dynamic range adjustment. The triblock DNA architecture comprises a poly&#8208;adenine (polyA) block for adjustable surface density anchoring, alongside stem and loop blocks for modulating structural stability. Through systematic manipulation of these blocks, we demonstrate the ability to achieve diverse target binding affinities and detection limits, achieving an initial 81&#8208;fold dynamic range. By combining probes with various affinities, we extend this dynamic range significantly to 10,900&#8208;fold. Furthermore, by implementing a sequestration mechanism, the effective dynamic range of the nanochannel biosensor is narrowed to only a 3&#8208;fold span of target concentrations. The customizable dynamic range of these advanced nanochannel biosensors makes them highly promising for a broad spectrum of biomedical and clinical applications.

         <title>An Angstrom&#8208;Scale Protective Skin Grown In Situ on Perovskite Oxide to Enhance Stability in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite has poor stability in aqueous reactions due to ion leaching. By one&#8208;step reduction, an angstrom&#8208;scale protective skin decorated with FeNi nanoparticles is in&#8197;situ grown on the Sr0.9Fe0.81Ta0.09Ni0.1O3&#8208;&#948;(SFTN) surface. The SFTN with protective skin (PS&#8208;SFTN) shows improved activity in water splitting and ultralong stability of more than 800&#8197;hours.







Abstract
The utilization of perovskite oxide as a catalyst for aqueous reactions is promising but challenging in stability. Here, we propose an in&#8197;situ growth strategy that constructs an ultrathin protective skin on the Sr0.9Fe0.81Ta0.09Ni0.1O3&#8208;&#948; perovskite surface and thus effectively solves the stability issue. Using a spherical aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscope, we observe the coexistence of an angstrom&#8208;scale (~7&#8197;&#197;) Fe2O3 protective skin and FeNi alloy nanoparticles. A number of alloy nanoparticles grow along with the skin and uniformly take root on the skin surface. Such a hierarchical structure can reconstruct the surface electronic structure and suppress the ion leaching of perovskite oxide in water. Benefiting from this unique structure, the catalyst has experienced a substantial increase (800&#8197;h, more than three orders of magnitude) in its stable operation time in water (for example, in a hydrogen evolution reaction). These results provide valuable insight into solid&#8208;solid phase transitions and have substantial implications for using structural defects at surfaces to modulate mass transport and transformation kinetics. Our strategy is sufficiently simple and can be used to subtly manipulate the catalyst structures to improve the performance of perovskite&#8208;based catalysts and potentially other oxide catalysts for a wide range of reactions.

         <title>Multifunctional Nanocomposite Polymer&#8208;integrated Ca&#8208;doped CeO2 Electrolyte for Robust and High&#8208;rate All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, multifunctional solid nanocomposite electrolytes (SNEs) are constructed by integrating Ca&#8208;doped CeO2 frameworks with fluorine&#8208;containing polymer to simultaneously address the sluggish Na+ transport and the uncontrollable Na dendrite propagation for robust and high&#8208;rate all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries (ASSSIBs).







Abstract
Due to the seamless interfaces between solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) and electrode materials, SPEs&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries (ASSSIBs) are considered promising energy storage systems. However, the sluggish Na+ transport and uncontrollable Na dendrite propagation still hinder the practical application of SPEs&#8208;based ASSSIBs. Herein, Ca&#8208;doped CeO2 (Ca&#8722;CeO2) nanotube framework is synthesized and integrated with poly (ethylene oxide) methyl ether acrylate&#8208;perfluoropolyether copolymer (PEOA&#8208;PFPE), resulting in multifunctional solid nanocomposite electrolytes (namely SNEs, i.e., PEOA&#8208;PFPE/Ca&#8722;CeO2).

&lt;p&gt;In this work, multifunctional solid nanocomposite electrolytes (SNEs) are constructed by integrating Ca-doped CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; frameworks with fluorine-containing polymer to simultaneously address the sluggish Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport and the uncontrollable Na dendrite propagation for robust and high-rate all-solid-state sodium-ion batteries (ASSSIBs).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the seamless interfaces between solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) and electrode materials, SPEs-based all-solid-state sodium-ion batteries (ASSSIBs) are considered promising energy storage systems. However, the sluggish Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport and uncontrollable Na dendrite propagation still hinder the practical application of SPEs-based ASSSIBs. Herein, Ca-doped CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Ca&#8722;CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) nanotube framework is synthesized and integrated with poly (ethylene oxide) methyl ether acrylate-perfluoropolyether copolymer (PEOA-PFPE), resulting in multifunctional solid nanocomposite electrolytes (namely SNEs, i.e., PEOA-PFPE/Ca&#8722;CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Our investigations demonstrate that the fluorous effect incurred by the fluorine-containing PEOA-PFPE and the oxygen vacancy effect induced by the Ca&#8722;CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; framework could synergistically promote the dissociation of sodium salt, ultimately enhancing the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; mobility in SNEs. Besides, the resultant SNEs construct rapid Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport channels and homogenize the Na deposition in SNEs/Na interface, which effectively prevents the Na dendrite growth. Furthermore, the assembled carbon-coated sodium vanadium phosphate (NVP@C)||PEOA-PFPE/Ca&#8722;CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;||Na coin cell delivers impressive rate capability of 97.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 2&#8197;C and outstanding cycling stability with capacity retention of 84.3&#8201;% after 300&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C.

         <title>Hederagenin is a Highly Selective Antagonist of the Neuropeptide FF Receptor 1 that Reveals Mechanisms for Subtype Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Identifying subtype&#8208;selective ligands for G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs) with highly conserved binding pockets is challenging. In this study, we characterize hederagenin&#8197;(1), a neuropeptide FF receptor&#8197;1 (NPFFR1) antagonist, which exhibits high selectivity over the neuropeptide FF receptor 2 (NPFFR2) despite its overlapping binding site with the endogenous agonist neuropeptide FF (NPFF). Analysis of the binding mode of hederagenin&#8197;(1) elucidates structural determinants for subtype selectivity in the NPFFR family.







Abstract
RF&#8208;amide peptide receptors including the neuropeptide FF receptor&#8197;1 (NPFFR1) are G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs) that modulate diverse physiological functions. High conservation of endogenous ligands and receptors makes the identification of selective ligands challenging. Previously identified antagonists mimic the C&#8208;terminus of peptide ligands and lack selectivity towards the closely related neuropeptide FF receptor&#8197;2 (NPFFR2) or the neuropeptide Y1 receptor (Y1R). In a high&#8208;throughput screening, we identified the pentacyclic triterpenoid hederagenin (1) as a novel selective antagonist for the NPFFR1. Hederagenin (1) is a natural product isolated from Hedera helix (ivy). We characterized its mode of activity using in vitro and in silico methods, revealing an overlapping binding site of the small molecule with the orthosteric peptide agonists. Despite the high similarity of the orthosteric binding pockets of NPFFR1 and NPFFR2, hederagenin (1) shows strong subtype selectivity, particularly caused by slight differences in the shape of the binding pockets and the rigidity of the small molecule. Several residues inhibiting the activity of hederagenin (1) at the NPFFR2 were identified. As NPFFR1 antagonists are discussed as potential candidates for the treatment of chronic pain, these insights into the structural determinants governing subtype specificity will facilitate the development of next&#8208;generation analgesics with improved safety and efficacy.

         <title>Regioselective and Homochiral Supramolecular Polymerization of Nanotadpole Aggremers of Poly(phenylacetylene) Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular polymerization is effective to achieve high hierarchical homochirality in nature. Here, enantiomeric nanotadpole aggregates from helical poly(phenylacetylene)s formed 1D chains with favored head&#8208;to&#8208;tail and homochiral connections, stemmed from size difference in heads and tails and chiral hexagonal columnar mesophase, respectively, which deepens the understanding of hierarchical homochirality.







Abstract
Biological homochirality is a signature of life. Supramolecular polymerization is effective to achieve high hierarchical homochirality in nature, but has not been well&#8208;explored. Herein, we report regioselective and homochiral supramolecular polymerization of chiral nanotadpole aggregates made of either synthetic helical poly(phenylacetylene)s or chirality&#8208;amplified co&#8208;assembly of chiral and achiral poly(phenylacetylene)s. The twisted nanotadpole aggregates with high screw&#8208;sense preference polymerized as monomers (aggremers) into supramolecular chains in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail regioselective and stepwise manner. Supramolecular copolymerization of enantiomeric aggremers favored formation of homochiral hierarchical supramolecular structures as visualized by TEM. Chiral hexagonal columnar mesophase of aggremers was responsive for the stereoselectivity. The work opens a gate to controllably and effectively construct functional chiral supramolecular materials and deepens the understanding of hierarchical biological homochirality.

         <title>A Molecular Engineering Approach to Conformationally Regulated Conductance Dualism in a Molecular Junction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new and simple methodology to mechanically addressable molecular conductance switches with large conductance variations (~103) between high&#8208; and low&#8208;G states is presented. By chemical design, rotational flexibility in these molecules and variable anchor group distances are translated into distinct conductance pathways for the different conformers of the same single molecule.







Abstract
One key aspect for the development of functional molecular electronic devices is the ability to precisely tune and reversibly switch the conductance of individual molecules in electrode&#8208;molecule&#8208;electrode junctions in response to external stimuli. In this work, we present a new approach to access molecular switches by deliberately controlling the flexibility in the molecular backbone. We here describe two new conductance switches based on bis(triarylamines) that rely on the reversible toggling between two conformers, each associated with vastly different conductances. By molecular design, we were able to realize an on/off ratio Ghigh/Glow of ~103, which is one of the largest values reported to date. Flicker noise analysis and molecular transport calculations indicate that on/off switching relies on a change of the conduction pathway and vast differences in molecule&#8208;electrode coupling. We thereby provide a new scaffold for further development of molecular conductance switches that are both efficient and easily refined.

         <title>Mutual Dependence between Membrane Phase Separation and Bacterial Division Protein Dynamics in Synthetic Cell Models</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate the mutual dependence of membrane phase separation and bacterial division protein dynamics. By reconstituting Min and Fts proteins inside phase separated GUVs, we observe interesting mode selection for protein dynamics and change in the reaction kinetics. We detect membrane deformations in the form of GUV blebs in synthetic cell models.







Abstract
Cell membranes in bacteria are laterally polarized to produce specific environments for membrane proteins, e.g., proteins involved in cell division which accumulate at mid&#8208;cell or the cell poles. An interesting result of such membrane&#8208;lipid interplay is the reorganization of lipid domains together with membrane&#8208;bound proteins at the onset of cell division, suggesting functional significance of membrane compartments in the cell cycle. Here, by adopting the key bacterial division proteins MinC, MinD, MinE, FtsA and FtsZ as an archetypal spatial patterning system, we present a simple vesicle&#8208;based in vitro model to explore the mutual dependence of protein pattern formation and membrane heterogeneity. Like many other peripheral membrane proteins, Min proteins exhibit preferential binding and macro&#8208;scale pattern formation at Ld domains, which leads to altered oscillation mode selection in phase&#8208;separated membrane compartments (GUVs). Moreover, incorporating bacterial division proteins within phase&#8208;separated GUVs leads to blebbing&#8208;like membrane deformations followed by the reorganization of Lo domains aligning at the neck region of the bleb, which agrees well with the domain rearrangement in bacterial membranes immediately preceding the radial constriction process. Overall, the presented in vitro model system showcases a basic framework to better comprehend the cellular division mechanism in consideration of complex cellular lipid environments.

Here, by adopting the key bacterial division proteins MinC, MinD, MinE, FtsA and FtsZ as an archetypal spatial patterning system, we present a simple vesicle-based in vitro model to explore the mutual dependence of protein pattern formation and membrane heterogeneity. Like many other peripheral membrane proteins, Min proteins exhibit preferential binding and macro-scale pattern formation at L&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; domains, which leads to altered oscillation mode selection in phase-separated membrane compartments (GUVs). Moreover, incorporating bacterial division proteins within phase-separated GUVs leads to blebbing-like membrane deformations followed by the reorganization of L&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; domains aligning at the neck region of the bleb, which agrees well with the domain rearrangement in bacterial membranes immediately preceding the radial constriction process. Overall, the presented in vitro model system showcases a basic framework to better comprehend the cellular division mechanism in consideration of complex cellular lipid environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Integrative Molecular Dynamics Simulations Untangle Cross&#8208;Linking Data to Unveil Mitochondrial Protein Distributions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The approach combines cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry, electron microscopy, and coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics simulations to map protein&#8208;protein interactions in mitochondria. This integration makes complex data clusters accessible, revealing protein distributions and localizations. Notably, it allows the localization of FAM162A and TMEM126A through super&#8208;resolution microscopy, showcasing the synergy of experimental and computational methods.







Abstract
Cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry (XL&#8208;MS) enables the mapping of protein&#8208;protein interactions on the cellular level. When applied to all compartments of mitochondria, the sheer number of cross&#8208;links and connections can be overwhelming, rendering simple cluster analyses convoluted and uninformative. To address this limitation, we integrate the XL&#8208;MS data, 3D electron microscopy data, and localization annotations with a supra coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics simulation to sort all data, making clusters more accessible and interpretable. In the context of mitochondria, this method, through a total of 6.9 milliseconds of simulations, successfully identifies known, suggests unknown protein clusters, and reveals the distribution of inner mitochondrial membrane proteins allowing a more precise localization within compartments. Our integrative approach suggests, that two so&#8208;far ambigiously placed proteins FAM162A and TMEM126A are localized in the cristae, which is validated through super resolution microscopy. Together, this demonstrates the strong potential of the presented approach.

         <title>Diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;Activated Dynamic Condensation Approach to Narrow&#8208;Band Gap Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dimethyldiketopyrrolopyrrole was developed as a monomer to conduct Knoevenagel condensation at its methyl groups in the presence of L&#8208;proline and 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine in aqueous solution, for the construction of a new type of vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with narrow band gaps and outstanding light&#8208;harvesting over the visible to near&#8208;infrared I regions. Such COFs are capable of high&#8208;performance photothermal conversion.







Abstract
Vinyl units intrinsically featuring less steric, nonpolarity, and unsaturated character, are well&#8208;known &#960;&#8208;bridge used in the synthesis of high&#8208;performance semiconducting materials. Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) represent a promising class of &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures, however, the range of available monomers for the reversible formation of carbon&#8208;carbon double bonds remains limited. In this study, a new class of 2D vinylene&#8208;linked COFs were synthesized using dimethyldiketopyrrolopyrrole (DM&#8208;DPP) as the key monomer. The strong electron deficiency of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) makes its methyl substituents readily activated upon the cocatalysis of L&#8208;proline and 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine in aqueous solution to conduct dynamic condensation with tritopic aromatic aldehydes. The resulting COFs crystallized in an eclipsed AA stacking arrangement and featured abundant, regular nanochannels. Their robust vinyl DPP&#8208;linking mode enhanced donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor conjugation and promoted &#960;&#8208;stacked alignment along the vertical direction. Consequently, the synthesized COFs exhibited band gaps as narrow as 1.02&#8197;eV and demonstrated excellent light&#8208;harvesting capability across the visible to near&#8208;infrared I (NIR&#8208;I) regions. Furthermore, the COFs could be converted into free&#8208;standing thin pellets through simple pressure casting, and show excellent photothermal response and cycling stability under different light sources.

         <title>CO Oxidation Catalyzed by Perovskites: The Role of Crystallographic Distortions Highlighted by Systematic Experiments and Artificial Intelligence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The identification of physical parameters correlated with the performance constitutes a fundamental step for the discovery of catalytic materials. Through a cooperative approach between rigorous experiments and AI, we identify a descriptor for the activity of perovskites in CO oxidation that depends on a parameter reflecting crystallographic distortions as well as on the elemental properties of A and B.







Abstract
The identification of key materials&#8217; parameters correlated with the performance can accelerate the development of heterogeneous catalysts and unveil the relevant underlying physical processes. However, the analysis of correlations is often hindered by inconsistent data. Besides, nontrivial, yet unknown relationships may be important, and the intricacy of the various processes may be significant. Here, we tackle these challenges for the CO oxidation catalyzed by perovskites using a combination of rigorous experiments and artificial intelligence. A series of 13 ABO3 (A=La, Pr, Nd, Sm; B=Cr, Mn, Fe, Co) perovskites was synthesized, characterized, and tested in catalysis. To the resulting dataset, we applied the symbolic&#8208;regression SISSO approach. We identified an analytical expression correlated with the activity that contains the normalized unit&#8208;cell volume, the Pauling electronegativity of the elements A and B, and the ionization energy of the element B. Therefore, the activity is described by crystallographic distortions and by the chemical nature of A and B elements. The generalizability of the identified descriptor is confirmed by the good quality of the predictions for 3 additional ABO3 and 16 chemically more complex AMn(1&#8208;x)B&#8217;xO3 (A=La, Pr, Nd; B&#8217;=Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) perovskites.

         <title>Ion Hydration Enables Generality in Asymmetric Catalysis: Desymmetrization to P&#8208;Stereogenic Triarylphosphine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substrate generality has been achieved through exploiting the fundamental physicochemical phenomenon of ion hydration. This strategy enables catalytic desymmetrization to access scaffold&#8208;diversified P&#8208;stereogenic phosphine oxides and sulfides (up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;er). The in situ tuning of hydration shells by water and the correlation between water/ion ratio and the geometry of the substrates (i.e., dO&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cl) render this approach practical and predictable.







Abstract
Asymmetric synthesis relies on seamless transmission of stereochemical information from a chiral reagent/catalyst to a prochiral substrate. The disruption by substrates&#8217; structural changes presents a hurdle in innovating generality&#8208;oriented asymmetric catalysis. Here, we report a strategy for substrate adaptability by exploiting a fundamental physicochemical phenomenon&#8212;ion hydration, in developing remote desymmetrization to access P&#8208;stereogenic triarylphosphine oxides and sulfides. Compared to existing methods, this approach does not require pre&#8208;installed ortho substituents and avoids the use of Grignard/organolithium reagents. Simply tuning the water/ion ratio in the reaction media tailors the water&#8208;mediated ionic substrate&#8211;catalyst preorganization to counterbalance the structural changes in the substrates, thus further increasing the diversity of enantioenriched P&#8208;stereogenic compounds. This study shows that it is viable and practical to precisely manipulate ionic interactions through tuning the dynamic ion hydration in situ, thereby adding a distinctive dimension to catalyst engineering in the pursuit of substrate generality in asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Integrated Ziegler&#8211;Natta/Brookhart&#8208;Ni Catalysts for the Synthesis of Sutured Polar High&#8208;Impact Polypropylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polar high&#8208;impact polypropylenes are prepared by mixed, core&#8208;shell, and integrated Ziegler&#8208;Natta/Brookhart&#8208;Ni dual&#8208;site catalysts. Among these catalysts, the integrated type affords polymers with great mechanical properties, and reduces microplastic release for polypropylene or polypropylene/polyethylene mixed&#8208;waste plastics. The polyolefin ionomer acts as a suture molecule that stitches different components into a whole network.







Abstract
The direct synthesis of polar high&#8208;impact polypropylenes using industrially&#8208;preferred heterogeneous catalysts is challenging due to the poisoning of polar functional groups towards metal center and the high stereo&#8208;selectivity requirement. In this work, dual&#8208;site catalysts combining Ziegler&#8211;Natta and Brookhart&#8208;Ni catalysts were used to produce polar polyolefin ionomers, followed by polar high&#8208;impact polypropylenes containing isotactic polypropylene and branched polyethylene as toughening agents. Three combination modes between these catalysts were investigated, including mixed, core&#8211;shell, and integrated types. The integrated dual&#8208;site catalyst achieved the optimal material properties because the polyolefin ionomer acted as a suture molecule that stitched different components into a whole network. This produced sutured polar high&#8208;impact polypropylenes with excellent mechanical properties and compatibility with polar substances. The restraining effect of the suture molecules greatly reduced the release of microplastic particles after aging. Moreover, the obtained polar high&#8208;impact polypropylene can serve as an efficient compatibilizer to recycle polyethylene/polypropylene mixed&#8208;waste plastics. This work provides an appealing and potentially practical strategy to upgrade the widely used polypropylenes and to alleviate the ever&#8208;growing plastic pollution issue.

         <title>Cocrystallization&#8208;Induced Red Ultralong Organic Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cocrystallization strategy has been developed to achieve red ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP). Precise intermolecular interactions within the cocrystal, along with theoretical calculations, provide a qualitative explanation of the red UOP behavior. This organic cocrystal system combines a high quantum yield (58&#8201;%) and strong red afterglow with a long&#8208;lived lifetime of 362&#8197;ms that is visible to the naked eye.







Abstract
Organic cocrystals formed through multicomponent self&#8208;assembly have attracted significant interest owing to their clear structure and tunable optical properties. However, most cocrystal systems suffer from inefficient long&#8208;wavelength emission and low phosphorescence efficiency due to strong non&#8208;radiative processes governed by the energy gap law. Herein, an efficient long&#8208;lived red afterglow is achieved using a pyrene (Py) cocrystal system incorporating a second component (NPYC4) with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) properties. The cocrystal (NPYC4&#8208;Py) not only inherits the excellent luminescence of its monomeric counterparts, but also exhibits unique dual&#8208;mode characteristics, including persistent TADF and UOP emission with a high quantum yield of 58&#8201;% and a lifetime of 362&#8197;ms. The precise cocrystal stacking distinctly reveals that intermolecular interactions lock the cocrystal formation and weaken the intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions between NPYC4 and Py, thereby stabilizing the excited triplet excitons. Furthermore, the favorable energy level of NPYC4 acts as a bridge, reducing the energy gap between the S1 and T1 states for Py, therefore activating its red phosphorescence from Py. This research provides direct insights into achieving efficient red UOP through co&#8208;crystallization.

         <title>Topology of Gemini&#8208;shaped Hexagonal Heterojunction for Efficient Stereoconvergent Transformation via Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional heterostructure containing kinetic resolution and racemization catalyst was developed by alternate stacking of Gemini&#8208;shaped hexagons with para&#8208;substitution, which has exhibited outstanding enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities for the efficient cooperation of adjacent dissimilar catalysts.







Abstract
Despite recent advances in the combination of kinetic resolution and racemization for efficient stereoconvergent transformation, the poor stability and limited reaction activities of the products restrict their wide application in industrial production. To overcome these problems, Gemini&#8208;shaped hexagons with para&#8208;heterojunctions for one&#8208;dimensional and two&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymers were designed via hydrogen&#8208;bonding adhesion by racemization catalyst 1 and kinetic resolution 2 in this work. The polymers from the assembly of Gemini&#8208;shaped hexagons exhibit rapid catalytic behaviour with efficient selectivity for the desired configuration in the synthesis of tertiary alcohols with contiguous stereocenters through dynamic kinetic resolution for the nanoscale heterojunctions of dissimilar catalysts. Among them, the developed 2D polymers gave outstanding enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities (&gt;99&#8201;% ee, 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr) through the cooperation of adjacent dissimilar catalysts. The heterojunctions varying dimensions and distances of dissimilar catalysts provide new insight for increasing the enantioselectivity of chiral organocatalysts.

         <title>Configuration&#8208;Mediated Efficient Non&#8208;Radiative Transition for R848&#8208;Assisted Photothermal Immunotherapy to Inhibit Tumor Growth and Metastasis by An In Situ Tumor Vaccine Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phenomenon of configuration&#8208;mediated non&#8208;radiative transition was observed in two isomers, namely CZTBT and LVTBT. Upon combination with R848, LVTBT@R848 NPs&#8208;induced photothermal immunotherapy could serve as an in&#8197;situ tumor vaccine, effectively inhibiting the growth of both primary and distant tumors, as well as restricted lung metastasis by activating the overwhelming immune response.







Abstract
Cancer metastasis remains a critical factor contributing to the current limitations in cancer treatment. Photothermal immunotherapy has emerged as a safe and potent therapeutic approach, demonstrating the capability to suppress tumor growth and metastasis. While researchers have extensively investigated various structural modifications to enhance photothermal conversion performance, the influence of molecular configuration has received comparatively limited attention. In this study, we synthesized two isomers, CZTBT and LVTBT, which possessed distinct configurations. LVTBT, characterized by a flatter molecular configuration, exhibited an extended absorption wavelength and a higher molar extinction coefficient. Its excited state facilitated stronger rotation for non&#8208;radiative transitions, leading to a high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of 36.3&#8201;%. When combined with R848, LVTBT@R848 nanoparticles (NPs)&#8208;mediated photothermal immunotherapy functioned as an in&#8197;situ tumor vaccine, promoting the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs), T cell infiltration, and the differentiation of natural killer (NK) cells and memory T cells, thereby activating the strong immune response. Consequently, it significantly inhibited the growth of both primary and distant tumors, while also limiting lung metastasis. In summary, this study proposed a configuration&#8208;mediated non&#8208;radiative transition strategy for efficient photothermal immunotherapy, advancing the frontiers of organic photothermal agents (OPTAs) design and synthesis.

         <title>Hexafluorophosphate&#8208;Triggered Hydrogen Isotope Exchange (HIE) in Fluorinated Environments: A Platform for the Deuteration of Aromatic Compounds via Strong Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new synthetic route for hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) in arenes has been developed using catalytic PF6&#8722; in deuterated hexafluoroisopropanol and D2O under mild conditions. This method achieves high yields and excellent deuterium incorporation in phenols, anisoles, anilines, and heteroaromatic substrates. An extended H&#8208;bonding network is responsible for activating the inert P&#8722;F bond in PF6&#8722;, allowing for HIE and the creation of deuterated compounds.







Abstract
There is a perpetual need for efficient and mild methods to integrate deuterium atoms into carbon frameworks through late&#8208;stage modifications. We have developed a simple and highly effective synthetic route for hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) in aromatic compounds under ambient conditions. This method utilizes catalytic amounts of hexafluorophosphate (PF6&#8722;) in deuterated 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP&#8208;d1) and D2O. Phenols, anilines, anisoles, and heterocyclic compounds were converted with high yields and excellent deuterium incorporations, which allows for the synthesis of a wide range of deuterated aromatic compounds. Spectroscopic and theoretical studies show that an interactive H&#8208;bonding network triggered by HFIP&#8208;d1 activates the typically inert P&#8722;F bond in PF6&#8722; for D2O addition.

     alt="Hexafluorophosphate-Triggered Hydrogen Isotope Exchange (HIE) in Fluorinated Environments: A Platform for the Deuteration of Aromatic Compounds via Strong Bond Activation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new synthetic route for hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) in arenes has been developed using catalytic PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in deuterated hexafluoroisopropanol and D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O under mild conditions. This method achieves high yields and excellent deuterium incorporation in phenols, anisoles, anilines, and heteroaromatic substrates. An extended H-bonding network is responsible for activating the inert P&#8722;F bond in PF6&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, allowing for HIE and the creation of deuterated compounds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a perpetual need for efficient and mild methods to integrate deuterium atoms into carbon frameworks through late-stage modifications. We have developed a simple and highly effective synthetic route for hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) in aromatic compounds under ambient conditions. This method utilizes catalytic amounts of hexafluorophosphate (PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) in deuterated 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP-&lt;i&gt;d&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) and D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Phenols, anilines, anisoles, and heterocyclic compounds were converted with high yields and excellent deuterium incorporations, which allows for the synthesis of a wide range of deuterated aromatic compounds. Spectroscopic and theoretical studies show that an interactive H-bonding network triggered by HFIP-&lt;i&gt;d&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; activates the typically inert P&#8722;F bond in PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; for D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O addition. The thus in situ formed DPO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; then triggers HIE, offering a new way to deuterated building blocks, drugs, and natural-product derivatives with high deuterium incorporation via the activation of strong bonds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Influence of Alkyl Spacers and Molecular Weight on the Charge Transport and Storage Properties of Oxy&#8208;Bithiophene&#8208;Based Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mismatch in polarity between polymer side chains and their solvation environment can lead to segmental aggregation, causing the flexible backbone to twist and, subsequently, deteriorate the polymer&#8216;s electronic properties.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers (CPs) with polar side chains can conduct electronic and ionic charges simultaneously, making them promising for bioelectronics, electrocatalysis and energy storage. Recent work showed that adding alkyl spacers between CP backbones and polar side chains improved electronic charge carrier mobility, reduced swelling and enhanced stability, without compromising ion transport. However, how alkyl spacers impact polymer backbone conformation and, subsequently, electronic properties remain unclear. In this work, we design two oxy&#8208;bithiophene&#8208;based CP series, each featuring progressively extended alkyl spacer lengths and two distinct molecular weight (MW) distributions. Using operando characterisations, we evaluate the (spectro)electrochemical and swelling properties of the polymer thin films, and their performance in organic field&#8208;effect transistors and organic electrochemical transistors. Surprisingly, alkyl spacers negatively impact the hole mobility of our polymers, with higher MW amplifying this effect. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we show that it is thermodynamically favourable for adjacent non&#8208;polar alkyl spacers to aggregate in polar electrolytes, leading to backbone twisting. Further spectroscopic measurements corroborate this prediction. Our findings demonstrate the active interactions between side chain structure, MW and electrolyte/solvent polarity in influencing polymer performance, underscoring the importance of considering solvation environment effects on polymer conformation when designing new mixed conducting CPs for electrochemical applications.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Efficient Heat Transport Across a &#8220;2.5D&#8221; All&#8208;Carbon sp2/sp3 Hybrid Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of 2.5D interface has been realized by the ultra&#8208;rapid annealing that can well maintain those metastable structures generated during the rapid heating. The result is obviously a breakthrough of high&#8208;efficient all&#8208;carbon TIM, and can be of great importance for the development of all&#8208;carbon devices and circuits.







Abstract
Single&#8208; and few&#8208;layer graphene&#8208;based thermal interface materials (TIMs) with extraordinary high&#8208;temperature resistance and ultra&#8208;high thermal conductivity are very essential to develop the next&#8208;generation integrated circuits. However, the function of the as&#8208;prepared graphene&#8208;based TIMs would undergo severe degradation when being transferred to chips, as the interface between the TIMs and chips possesses a very small interfacial thermal conductance. Here, a &#8220;2.5D&#8221; all&#8208;carbon interface containing rich covalent bonding, namely a sp2/sp3 hybrid interfaces is designed and realized by a plasma&#8208;assisted chemical vapor deposition with a function of ultra&#8208;rapid quenching. The interfacial thermal conductance of the 2.5D interface is excitingly very high, up to 110&#8211;117&#8197;MWm&#8722;2&#8201;K&#8722;1 at graphene thickness of 12&#8211;25&#8197;nm, which is even more than 30&#8201;% higher than various metal/diamond contacts, and orders of magnitude higher than the existing all&#8208;carbon contacts. Atomic&#8208;level simulation confirm the key role of the efficient heat conduction via covalent C&#8722;C bonds, and reveal that the covalent&#8208;based heat transport could contribute 85&#8201;% to the total interfacial conduction at a hybridization degree of 22&#8197;at&#8201;%. This study provides an efficient strategy to design and construct 2.5D all&#8208;carbon interfaces, which can be used to develop high performance all&#8208;carbon devices and circuits.

         <title>Unclicking the Click: A Depolymerizable Clicked Polymer via Two Consecutive Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Reactions</title>

         <dc:description>
A major drawback with polymers synthesized via Cu&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition is its inability to undergo depolymerization. We addressed this limitation by replacing the triazolyl&#8208;linkage with the isosteric triazolinyl&#8208;linkage via topochemical ene&#8208;azide cycloaddition (TEAC) chemistry. The latter underwent denitrogenation to form hydrolyzable imine&#8208;linked polymer. As a proof of concept, we have hydrolyzed the imine&#8208;linked polymer, quantitatively obtaining monomer equivalents. This result enlists triazoline&#8208;linked polymers as depolymerizable polymers.







Abstract
We report here a clicked polymer that can be depolymerized by a declicking reaction. A designed dipeptide monomer, upon heating its crystals, underwent a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal topochemical ene&#8208;azide cycloaddition polymerization to form a triazoline&#8208;linked polymer, which upon further heating, underwent a remarkable SCSC denitrogenation, resulting in an imine&#8208;linked polymer quantitatively. As both the TEAC polymerization and the denitrogenation occurred in SCSC fashion, the structures of the triazoline&#8208;linked polymer and the imine&#8208;linked polymer could be determined at atomic resolution by SCXRD. Acid hydrolysis of the imine&#8208;linked polymer leads to quantitative depolymerization, yielding a dipeptide, showcasing the degradability and depolymerizability of such polymers. This solid&#8208;state click polymerization and denitrogenation yielding depolymerizable polymer is attractive over the usual click polymers that cannot be unclicked.

         <title>Spontaneous Generation of Alkoxide Radical from Alcohols on Microdroplets Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the spontaneous generation of alkoxide radicals from alcohols (RCH2OH) in aqueous microdroplets. An electric field (~10&#8722;1&#8197;V/&#197;) combined with partial solvation at the air&#8208;water interface promotes the dissociation of RCH2OH into RCH2O&#8722; and H3O+ ions. The RCH2O&#8722; ions can subsequently undergo ionization to form RCH2O&#8901; radicals, which then isomerize to the more stable R&#8901;CHOH species.







Abstract
Water microdroplets have been demonstrated to exhibit extraordinary chemical behaviors, including the abilities to accelerate chemical reactions by several orders of magnitude and to trigger reactions that cannot occur in bulk water. One of the most striking examples is the spontaneous generation of hydroxyl radical from hydroxide ions. Alcohols and alkoxide ions, being structurally similar to water and hydroxide ions, might exhibit similar behavior on microdroplets. Here, we report the spontaneous generation of alkoxide radicals from alcohols (RCH2OH) in aqueous microdroplets through quantum chemical calculations, quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, ab&#8197;initio MD simulations, and mass spectrometry. Our results show that an electric field (EF) on the order of 10&#8722;1&#8197;V/&#197; and partial solvation at the air&#8208;water interface jointly promote the dissociation of RCH2OH into RCH2O&#8722; and H3O+ ions. QM/MM MD simulations indicate that RCH2O&#8722; can be ionized to produce RCH2O&#8901; radicals on the microdroplet surface. Furthermore, partial solvation and the EF collaboratively catalyze the isomerization of the RCH2O&#8901; radical into a more stable tautomer, R&#8901;CHOH. This study highlights the molecular mechanisms underlying the widespread generation of radicals at the microdroplet surface and provides insights into the importance of fundamental alcohol chemistry in the atmosphere.

The RCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions can subsequently undergo ionization to form RCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&#8901; radicals, which then isomerize to the more stable R&#8901;CHOH species.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water microdroplets have been demonstrated to exhibit extraordinary chemical behaviors, including the abilities to accelerate chemical reactions by several orders of magnitude and to trigger reactions that cannot occur in bulk water. One of the most striking examples is the spontaneous generation of hydroxyl radical from hydroxide ions. Alcohols and alkoxide ions, being structurally similar to water and hydroxide ions, might exhibit similar behavior on microdroplets. Here, we report the spontaneous generation of alkoxide radicals from alcohols (RCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH) in aqueous microdroplets through quantum chemical calculations, quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, ab&#8197;initio MD simulations, and mass spectrometry. Our results show that an electric field (EF) on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;V/&#197; and partial solvation at the air-water interface jointly promote the dissociation of RCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH into RCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. QM/MM MD simulations indicate that RCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; can be ionized to produce RCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&#8901; radicals on the microdroplet surface. Furthermore, partial solvation and the EF collaboratively catalyze the isomerization of the RCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&#8901; radical into a more stable tautomer, R&#8901;CHOH. This study highlights the molecular mechanisms underlying the widespread generation of radicals at the microdroplet surface and provides insights into the importance of fundamental alcohol chemistry in the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Production of Branched Alkanes by Upcycling of Waste Polyethylene over Controlled Acid Sites of SO4/ZrO2&#8208;Al2O3 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyethylene was selectively converted into a valuable gasoline component, achieving yields of up to 73.3&#8201;% with a 90.1&#8201;% proportion of branched alkanes over SO4/ZrO2&#8208;Al2O3 at 280&#8201;&#176;C. The synergistic coupling between sulfate groups and Lewis acid sites (Zr sites) enhances polyethylene activation, while weak and moderate Br&#248;nsted acid sites regulate the reaction pathway to favor branched alkane production.heterogeneous catalysisbranched alkanesplastic upcyclingpolyethyleneacid sites







Abstract
Branched alkanes, which enhance the octane number of gasoline, can be produced from waste polyethylene. However, achieving highly selective production of branched alkanes presents a significant challenge in the upcycling of waste polyethylene. Here, we report a one&#8208;pot process to convert polyethylene into gasoline&#8208;range hydrocarbons (C4&#8211;C13) with yield of 73.3&#8201;% over SO4/ZrO2&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst at 280&#8201;&#176;C. The proportion of branched alkanes reaches 90.1&#8201;% within the C4&#8211;C13 fraction. Incorporation of sulfate group endows the catalyst with strong Lewis acid sites and weak and moderate Br&#248;nsted acid sites. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption, in situ infrared spectroscopy, in situ small angle neutron scattering, and DFT calculations reveal that polyethylene activation occurs through the synergy between sulfate groups and strong Lewis acid sites (Zr sites). The weak and moderate Br&#248;nsted acid sites preferentially catalyze the isomerization and type A &#946;&#8208;scission processes, which favors the formation of branched alkanes, while suppressing competing reactions that produce straight&#8208;chain alkanes.

         <title>Unprecedented Photoinduced&#8208;Electron&#8208;Transfer Probe with a Turn&#8208;ON Chemiluminescence Mode&#8208;of&#8208;Action</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first PeT&#8208;based turn&#8208;on probe utilizing a chemiluminescent mechanism is presented. The probe is activated through a reaction between a quenched dioxetane&#8208;azide and a strained cycloalkyne, resulting in high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise protein detection and outperforming a fluorescent analog.







Abstract
PeT&#8208;based fluorescent probes were demonstrated to be powerful tools for detection and imaging, owing to their significant fluorescence enhancement in response to specific targets. While numerous examples of fluorescence&#8208;based PeT have been frequently reported, there is not even a single example of a PeT probe that operates via a chemiluminescence mode. Here we report the first PeT&#8208;based turn&#8208;on probe that acts via a chemiluminescent operation mode. We designed, synthesized, and evaluated a novel chemiluminescent probe, featuring a PeT&#8208;based turn&#8208;on mechanism. The probe consists of a phenoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxetane, linked to an azide unit that acts as a PeT quencher. Upon cycloaddition of a strained cycloalkyne with the azide, a triazole&#8208;dioxetane is formed, which undergoes relatively slow chemiexcitation, resulting in a measurement window with an exceptionally high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (over 5000&#8208;fold). The PeT&#8208;dioxetane probe could effectively detect and image two model proteins labeled with strained cycloalkyne units (Myc&#8208;DBCO and Max&#8208;DBCO) through either NHS or maleimide conjugations. Comparative analysis shows that our PeT&#8208;based chemiluminescent probe significantly outperforms a commercially available fluorescent analog. We anticipate that the insights gained from this study will facilitate the development of additional chemiluminescent probes utilizing various PeT&#8208;quenching pathways.

         <title>Unlocking the Ultrafast Deposition Kinetics within Bi&#8208;Tailored Core&#8208;Shell Structured Carbon Nanofibers for Highly Efficient and Ultrastable Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous amorphous carbon nanofiber embedded with Bi nanoparticles in the void spaces (Bi@NC) serves as a core&#8211;shell structured Na metal host. The in&#8208;situ formed Na3Bi facilitates rapid nucleation and ion diffusion, enabling uniform Na plating within the cavities and a stable SEI outside the carbon nanofiber. This design ensures high&#8208;rate performance and cycle stability, thereby providing a testament to its suitability in Na metal anode chemistry.







Abstract
Sodium metal anodes (SMA), featuring high energy content, low electrochemical potential and easy availability, are a compelling option for sustainable energy storage. However, notorious sodium dendrite and unstable solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) have largely retarded their widespread implantation. Herein, porous amorphous carbon nanofiber embedded with Bi nanoparticles in nanopores (Bi@NC) was rationally designed as a 3D host for SMA. In situ and ex situ characterizations, along with theoretical simulations unlock that the in&#8208;situ formed Na&#8722;Bi alloy significantly accelerates sodium metal nucleation and sodium ion diffusion kinetics, enabling uniform sodium plating within the void spaces and a stable SEI outside the carbon nanofiber. Particularly, the Bi@NC electrode achieved a high coulombic efficiency of 99.99&#8201;% at 3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in half&#8208;cell tests, a cycle life of 1000&#8197;hours at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and sustained performance over 600 cycles under harsh conditions under 30&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 within symmetrical cells. The full battery assembled with a Na3V2(PO4)3@C cathode and Bi@NC anode delivered long&#8208;term cyclability over 800 cycles, demonstrating its potential for flexible application of sodium&#8208;based energy storage systems. This work highlights the Bi@NC electrode as a promising candidate for high&#8208;performance and flexible sodium metal batteries.

A novel isotropic fullerene&#8208;hybridized fused&#8208;ring electron acceptor, C60&#8208;Y, featuring a high dielectric constant and isotropic molecular packing, has been synthesized. The fullerene hybrid enhances exciton dissociation, reduces energy losses, and improves charge mobility. When incorporated into a ternary blend system, it achieved an impressive PCE of 19.22&#8201;%, outperforming other reported ternary OSCs utilizing fullerene derivatives as the third component.

A novel isotropic fullerene&#8208;hybridized fused&#8208;ring electron acceptor, designated C60&#8208;Y, has been synthesized via a mild [4+2] Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition reaction with fullerene C60 to enhance the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Comparative analysis shows that C60&#8208;Y significantly outperforms the control acceptor Me&#8722;Y, with a notable increase in the relative dielectric constant from 2.79 to 3.95. This improvement enhances exciton dissociation and reduces non&#8208;radiative energy losses. Additionally, the isotropic molecular packing of C60&#8208;Y, similar to fullerene, facilitates efficient interface formation with donor polymers and improves charge mobility. As a result, incorporating C60&#8208;Y as an electron acceptor increases the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of binary OSCs to 15.02&#8201;%, surpassing the 13.31&#8201;% achieved with Me&#8722;Y. Moreover, when integrated into a ternary blend system, an impressive PCE of 19.22&#8201;% is achieved, top&#8208;performing among reported ternary OSCs utilizing fullerene derivatives as the third component. These results suggest that fullerene&#8208;hybridized acceptors like C60&#8208;Y hold great potential for advancing high&#8208;efficiency OSCs by enhancing exciton dissociation, reducing energy losses, and improving charge mobility.

         <title>Membrane&#8208;Free Water Electrolysis for Hydrogen Generation with Low Cost</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative membrane&#8208;free water electrolysis H2 production system over a class of Cu&#8208;based urea oxidation catalysts was developed. CuXO catalyst exhibits unique selectivity for clean N2 rather than toxic NO2&#8722;/NO3&#8722; and eliminates the risk of H2&#8208;O2 mixing. The industrial&#8208;scale membrane&#8208;free electrolyser based on this system successfully reduces H2 production cost to US$1.81&#8197;kg&#8722;1, lower than those of grey H2 while meeting 2030 technical target (US$2.00&#8211;2.50&#8197;kg&#8722;1) set by United States Department of Energy.







Abstract
Conventional water electrolysis relies on expensive membrane&#8208;electrode assemblies and sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode, which makes the cost of green hydrogen (H2) generation much higher than that of grey H2. Here, we develop an innovative and efficient membrane&#8208;free water electrolysis system to overcome these two obstacles simultaneously. This system utilizes the thermodynamically more favorable urea oxidation reaction (UOR) to generate clean N2 over a new class of Cu&#8208;based catalyst (CuXO) for replacing OER, fundamentally eliminating the explosion risk of H2 and O2 mixing while removing the need for membranes. Notably, this membrane&#8208;free electrolysis system exhibits the highest H2 Faradaic efficiency among reported membrane&#8208;free electrolysis work. In situ spectroscopic studies reveal that the new N2Hy intermediate&#8208;mediated UOR mechanism on the CuXO catalyst ensures its unique N2 selectivity and OER inertness. More importantly, an industrial&#8208;type membrane&#8208;free water electrolyser (MFE) based on this system successfully reduces electricity consumption to only 3.78&#8197;kWh&#8201;Nm&#8722;3, significantly lower than the 5.17&#8197;kWh&#8201;Nm&#8722;3 of commercial alkaline water electrolyzers (AWE). Comprehensive techno&#8208;economic analysis (TEA) suggests that the membrane&#8208;free design and reduced electricity input of the MFE plants reduce the green H2 production cost to US$1.81&#8197;kg&#8722;1, which is lower than those of grey H2 while meeting the technical target (US$2.00&#8211;2.50&#8197;kg&#8722;1) set by European Commission and United States Department of Energy.

         <title>Bimagnetic Core/Shell Nanoprobes with Tunable Exchange Coupling for High Resolution and Sensitive Magnetic Particle Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimagnetic core/shell nanotracers with the exchange coupling facilitate high resolution and sensitive magnetic particle imaging. At equivalent mass concentrations, bimagnetic core/shell nanotracers show a 5.08&#8208;fold increase in signal intensity and achieves a resolution of 1&#8197;mm compared to conventional tracers like VivoTrax. The excellent MPI performance contributes to the sensitive detection of orthotopic colorectal cancer in mice.







Abstract
Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) has demonstrated versatile applications in biomedicine, including tumor imaging, cell tracking, and image&#8208;guided hyperthermia. Despite these advancements, the prevalent use of clinically approved tracers has posed limitations on MPI&#8242;s resolution and sensitivity. In this study, we engineered a bimagnetic core/shell nanocrystals (BMCS) tailored for MPI by optimizing the heterostructure and modulating the exchange coupling effect between the two magnetic components. The resulting BMCS exhibited remarkably heightened susceptibility and magnetization while maintaining low coercivity, thereby substantially improved both MPI resolution and sensitivity compared to conventional tracers such as VivoTrax. At an equivalent mass concentration, BMCS demonstrated a notable 5.08&#8208;fold increase in signal intensity and achieved an unprecedentedly high resolution down to 1&#8197;mm. The excellent MPI performance contributes to high resolution MPI and the sensitive detection of orthotopic colorectal cancer in mice. The design strategy employed in BMCS, centered on the exchange coupling effect, introduces an efficacious approach for the development of high performance MPI tracers.

         <title>Evolution of Interfacial Hydration Structure Induced by Ion Condensation and Correlation Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using 3D&#8208;AFM, the concentration&#8208;dependent evolution of interfacial hydration structure in multivalent ionic solutions is observed, including interlayer thickenning and hydration force increasement. Theory and simulations identify strong ion condensation and correlation effects, driven by multivalence, as the underlying mechanisms. These phenomena exhibit universality across different substrates and multivalent ions, and are crucial for fields including electrochemistry and colloid chemistry.







Abstract
Interfacial hydration structures are crucial in wide&#8208;ranging applications, including battery, colloid, lubrication. Multivalent ions like Mg2+ and La3+ show irreplaceable roles in these applications, which are hypothesized due to their unique interfacial hydration structures. However, this hypothesis lacks experimental supports. Here, we provide the first observation for their interfacial hydration structures with molecular resolution using atomic force microscopy. We observed the evolution of layered hydration structures at La(NO3)3 solution&#8208;mica interfaces. As concentration increases from 25&#8197;mM to 2&#8197;M, the layer number varies from 2 to 1 and back to 2, and the interlayer thickness rises from 0.25&#177;0.05 to 0.34&#177;0.03&#8197;nm, with hydration force increasing from 0.27&#177;0.07 to 1.04&#177;0.24&#8197;nN. Theory and molecular simulation reveal that the cations form inner&#8208;sphere complexes. Multivalence induces concentration&#8208;dependent ion condensation and correlation effects, resulting in compositional and structural evolution within interfacial hydration structures. Additional experiments at seven different solid&#8211;liquid interfaces together with literature comparison confirm the universality of this mechanism for both multivalent and monovalent ions. New factors affecting interfacial hydration structures are revealed, including concentration and solvent dielectric constant. This insight provides guidance for designing interfacial hydration structures to optimize solid&#8211;liquid&#8208;interphase for battery life extension, modulate colloid stability and develop efficient lubricants.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;bridging defect sites are achieved in a metal&#8211;organic framework by integrating a modulator molecule (T&#8217;) into a homologous ligand (T), allowing to unveil the role of them on improving lithium storage performance in this study. The presence of defect sites enables markedly improved Li+ adsorption energy (&#916;Ea) and reduced Li+ migration barriers (Em), leading to boosted lithium storage capabilities.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are lagging in the use of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), ascribing to full coordination between metal nodes and organic ligands, to a large extent. By integrating a modulator into a ligand with missing bridging functionality, this study elucidates the role of non&#8208;bridging defect sites in MOFs in tailoring lithium storage performance. A fully bridged pristine MOF (p&#8208;MOF) utilizing the meso&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;carboxylphenyl) porphyrin ligand is compared with a modified MOF containing non&#8208;bridging defects (d&#8208;MOF) introduced by a homologous ligand, tris(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) porphyrin. Spectroscopic and cryogenic low&#8208;dose electron microscopy techniques verify the presence of non&#8208;bridging defect sites in the d&#8208;MOF and reveal their explicit local structure. Density functional theory calculations show significantly enhanced Li+ adsorption energies and reduced Li+ migration barriers at the non&#8208;bridging sites in the d&#8208;MOF compared to the fully bridging sites in the p&#8208;MOF. As a result, the d&#8208;MOF exhibits exceptional lithium storage performance, achieving a high capacity of 761&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and superior rate performance of 203&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, which substantially outperform the p&#8208;MOF. This study highlights the potential of modulating MOFs with non&#8208;bridging defects to develop high&#8208;performance LIBs.

         <title>Achieving a Thermodynamic Self&#8208;Regulation Dynamic Adsorption Mechanism for Ammonia Synthesis through Selective Orbital Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermetallic NbNi3 has circumvented the scaling relations of nitrogen reduction reaction via a thermodynamic self&#8208;regulation dynamic adsorption mechanism, as well as suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction through separating the active sites out, thus achieving a record&#8208;low theoretical limiting potential of &#8722;0.11&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode.







Abstract
With the continuous pursuing on the improvement of catalytic activity, a catalyst performed exceeding catalytic volcano plots is desired, while it is impeded by the adsorption&#8208;energy scaling relations of reaction intermediates. Numerous efforts have been focused on optimizing the initial and final intermediates to circumvent the scaling relations for an improved performance. For a step forward, simultaneously optimizing all intermediates is essential to explore the theoretical maximum of catalytic activity. Herein, we proposed a dynamic adsorption mechanism (DAM) to independently regulate the adsorption configurations of all intermediates of electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). To demonstrate the DAM, a multi&#8208;site NbNi3 intermetallic is developed, which enables suitable adsorption energies of different intermediates via modulating orbital coupling mechanisms. As a result, NbNi3 achieves an ultra&#8208;low limiting potential of NRR of &#8722;0.11&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Strikingly, the theoretical result is confirmed by a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment, wherein the nanoporous NbNi3 electrode exhibits a remarkable NH3 yield rate of 25.89&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with the Faradaic efficiency of 33.15&#8201;% at &#8722;0.25&#8197;V vs. RHE. Overall, this work brings out a new strategy to avoid the scaling relations, and opens up a promising avenue toward high&#8208;efficiency NRR catalysts.

         <title>Alternating Donor&#8208;Acceptor Ladder&#8208;Type Heteroarene for Efficient Photothermal Conversion via Boosting Non&#8208;Radiative Decay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternating donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) ladder&#8208;type heteroarene, FCDTDPP, is designed and synthesized for efficient photothermal conversion. With features including mixed D&#8208;A interactions, local aromaticity, self&#8208;absorption, and narrow bandgap, it optimizes non&#8208;radiative decay, achieving high photothermal efficiency and therapeutic capabilities against tumors. Unlike traditional twisted structures, this ladder&#8208;type fused heteroarene design offers a promising molecular engineering approach for advancing organic phototheranostic agents.







Abstract
The development of novel ladder&#8208;type conjugated molecules is crucial for advancing supramolecular chemistry and material science. In this study, we report a straightforward synthesis of new alternating donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) ladder&#8208;type heteroarene, FCDTDPP, and demonstrate its application as photothermal agent for imaging and cancer therapy. FCDTDPP is constructed by vinylene bridge between cyclopentadithiophene (D) and diketopyrrolopyrrole (A) through intramolecular Friedel&#8211;Crafts type reaction. FCDTDPP exhibits unique combination of good molecular planarity, efficient intra&#8208;/intermolecular mixed D&#8208;A interactions, and local aromaticity. These features collectively contribute to its broad and intense absorptions with narrow band gap in red band of the spectra, coupled with multiple vibrational absorption feature, thereby enhancing non&#8208;radiative decay process and resulting in efficient photothermal conversion property. FCDTDPP and its nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit superior photothermal conversion performance and stability under 660&#8197;nm laser irradiation. Moreover, in vitro studies reveal that FCDTDPP NPs possess excellent biocompatibility, low cytotoxicity, and robust photothermal therapeutic efficacy, a finding further corroborated by preliminary in vivo experiments in tumor&#8208;bearing mice. This work charts a novel course for the molecular engineering of organic photothermal conversion systems, propelling relevant research forward.

Noncanonical protein splicing illuminated: Radical S&#8208;adenosyl methionine spliceases post&#8208;translationally install &#945;&#8208;keto&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amide residues in a widespread family of peptide natural products. Here, we established the in vitro activity of a model splicease to interrogate its mechanism. The key data establish tyrosine C&#945; as the initial site of peptide radical formation and 4&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehyde as the tyrosine&#8208;derived coproduct to instruct our mechanistic proposal to this protease&#8208;inhibiting pharmacophore.







Abstract
Radical S&#8208;adenosyl methionine enzymes catalyze a diverse repertoire of post&#8208;translational modifications in protein and peptide substrates. Among these, an exceptional and mechanistically obscure example is the installation of &#945;&#8208;keto&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino acid residues by formal excision of a tyrosine&#8208;derived tyramine unit. The responsible spliceases are key maturases in a widespread family of natural products termed spliceotides that comprise potent protease inhibitors, with the installed &#946;&#8208;residues being crucial for bioactivity. Here, we established the in vitro activity of the model splicease PcpXY to interrogate the mechanism of non&#8208;canonical protein splicing. Identification of shunt and coproducts, deuterium labeling studies, and density functional theory energy calculations of hypothesized intermediates support a mechanism involving hydrogen abstraction at tyrosine C&#945; as the initial site of peptide radical formation and release of 4&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehyde as the tyrosine&#8208;derived coproduct. The data illuminate key features of this unprecedented radical&#8208;mediated biotransformation yielding ketoamide pharmacophores that are also present in peptidomimetic therapeutics.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Mechanoresistivity by Intermetallic Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method to impart mechanoresistive behaviour to molecular junctions is described in this contribution, relying on metal&#8208;ion interactions between Au electrodes and the Pt(II) centre of cyclometalated molecular wires. Junctions can be cycled between the low&#8208;conductance and high&#8208;conductance state by mechanical compression and relaxation, with changes in transport efficiency exceeding a factor of 103.X/Twitter Handles:







Abstract
The metal&#8208;electrode interface is key to unlocking emergent behaviour in all organic electrified systems, from battery technology to molecular electronics. In the latter, interfacial engineering has enabled efficient transport, higher device stability, and novel functionality. Mechanoresistivity &#8211; the change in electrical behaviour in response to a mechanical stimulus and a pathway to extremely sensitive force sensors &#8211; is amongst the most studied phenomena in molecular electronics, and the molecule&#8208;electrode interface plays a pivotal role in its emergence, reproducibility, and magnitude. In this contribution, we show that organometallic molecular wires incorporating a Pt(II) cation show mechanoresistive behaviour of exceptional magnitude, with conductance modulations of more than three orders of magnitude upon compression by as little as 1&#8197;nm. We synthesised series of cyclometalated Pt(II) molecular wires, and used scanning tunnelling microscopy &#8211; break junction techniques to characterise their electromechanical behaviour. Mechanoresistivity arises from an interaction between the Pt(II) cation and the Au electrode triggered by mechanical compression of the single&#8208;molecule device, and theoretical modelling confirms this hypothesis. Our study provides a new tool for the design of functional molecular wires by exploiting previously unreported ion&#8208;metal interactions in single&#8208;molecule devices, and develops a new framework for the development of mechanoresistive molecular junctions.

         <title>Polymeric Iodine Transport Layer Enabled High Areal Capacity Dual Plating Zinc&#8208;Iodine Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The capacity of zinc&#8208;iodine battery is limited by the low conductivity of iodine. In this work, a polymeric conductive PVA hydrogel cathode was proposed. The unique &#8220;confined transport&#8221; of iodide/polyiodides ions in the hydrogel can effectively enhance the areal capacity with suppressed polyiodide shuttle effect.







Abstract
Iodine cathode in aqueous battery has drawn great attention due to its high energy density and high safety. However, iodine has extremely low conductivity of 1&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, which usually results in low specific capacity. In this work, a PVA&#8208;hydrogel layer was designed to enhance the areal capacity of zinc&#8208;iodine cell. The areal capacity of PVA&#8208;hydrogel layer modified CNT cathode showed twice as higher capacity than that of pure CNT film in a dual&#8208;plating cell, The significant enhancement of the capacity was attributed to the fast iodine transport in the PVA&#8208;hydrogel layer. Besides, the strong interaction between PVA chain and polyiodide anions prevented the shuttle effect. The PVA modified CNT cathode could stably operate for over 3000&#8197;hours with remarkably higher capacity and cycle life. We analyzed the uniquely fast transport behavior of polyiodides in PVA hydrogel by in situ Raman spectroscopy, in situ optical micrography, as well as DFT calculations. It was found that the strong binding force together with lower dissociation energy of iodine on PVA chain is the dominate reason for reduced shuttle effect and fast polyiodide transport. As a result, the assembled PVA&#8208;I2 pouch cells showed excellent performance in both dual&#8208;plating cells and conventional&#8208;type cells.

         <title>Integrating Machine Learning and Large Language Models to Advance Exploration of Electrochemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we integrate machine learning (ML) and large language models (LLMs) to accelerate the exploration of electrochemical C&#8722;H oxidation reactions. A rapid screening platform is developed for experimental screening, while LLMs assist in literature mining and generate Python code to train ML models for reactivity prediction and synthesis optimization. This human&#8208;AI collaboration enables synthetic chemists to streamline discovery processes and optimize reaction conditions efficiently.







Abstract
Electrochemical C&#8722;H oxidation reactions offer a sustainable route to functionalize hydrocarbons, yet identifying suitable substrates and optimizing synthesis remain challenging. Here, we report an integrated approach combining machine learning and large language models to streamline the exploration of electrochemical C&#8722;H oxidation reactions. Utilizing a batch rapid screening electrochemical platform, we evaluated a wide range of reactions, initially classifying substrates by their reactivity, while LLMs text&#8208;mined literature data to augment the training set. The resulting ML models for reactivity prediction achieved high accuracy (&gt;90&#8201;%) and enabled virtual screening of a large set of commercially available molecules. To optimize reaction conditions for selected substrates, LLMs were prompted to generate code that iteratively improved yields. This human&#8208;AI collaboration proved effective, efficiently identifying high&#8208;yield conditions for 8 drug&#8208;like substances or intermediates. Notably, we benchmarked the accuracy and reliability of 12 different LLMs&#8211;including LLaMA series, Claude series, OpenAI o1, and GPT&#8208;4&#8208;on code generation and function calling related to ML based on natural language prompts given by chemists to showcase potentials for accelerating research across four diverse tasks. In addition, we collected an experimental benchmark dataset comprising 1071 reaction conditions and yields for electrochemical C&#8722;H oxidation reactions.

         <title>Biomimetic Elastic Single&#8208;Atom Protrusions Enhance Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic elastic Mo single&#8208;atom protrusion, featuring symmetry&#8208;breaking Mo sites for strong coupling and activation of nitrogen (N2), and an elastic Mo&#8722;O4 pyramidal structure that dynamically adapts to rapidly changing intermediates, lowering formation energy barriers. Together, these features enable exceptional N2 fixation activity. This bioinspired approach paves the way for designing efficient catalysts for complex multistep reactions.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrogen (N2) reduction reaction (eNRR) is a promising route for sustainable ammonia (NH3) generation, but the eNRR efficiency is dramatically impeded by sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, inspired by the dynamic extension&#8208;contraction of sea anemone tentacles in response to environmental changes, we propose a biomimetic elastic Mo single&#8208;atom protrusion on vanadium oxide support (pSA Mo/VOH) electrocatalyst featuring a symmetry&#8208;breaking Mo site and an elastic Mo&#8722;O4 pyramid for efficient eNRR. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the protruding Mo&#8208;induced symmetry&#8208;breaking structure optimizes the d&#8208;electron filling of Mo, enhancing the back&#8208;donation to the &#960;* antibonding orbital, effectively polarizing the N&#8801;N bond and reducing the barrier from *N2 to *N2H. Notably, the elastic Mo&#8722;O4 pyramidal structure of pSA Mo provides a dynamic Mo&#8722;O microenvironment during continuous eNRR processes. This optimizes the electronic structure of the Mo sites based on different reaction intermediates, enhancing the adsorption of various N intermediates and maintaining low barriers throughout the six&#8208;step hydrogenation process. Consequently, the elastic pSA Mo/VOH exhibits an excellent NH3 yield rate of 50.71&#177;1.12&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 35.38&#177;1.03&#8201;%, outperforming most electrocatalysts.

         <title>Packing Engineering of Zirconium Metal&#8208;Organic Cages in Mixed Matrix Membranes for CO2/CH4 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixed matrix membranes containing two polymorphous cage networks (ZrT&#8208;2&#945; and ZrT&#8208;2&#946;) were fabricated using a packing engineering approach. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption and positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy were employed to differentiate distinct polymorphic structures within the membrane matrix. Gas permeation tests revealed that the corresponding MMMs showed superior CO2/CH4 separation performance, exceeding the Robeson upper bound.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) have been considered as emerging zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) porous fillers to generate molecularly homogeneous MOC&#8208;based membrane materials.

&lt;p&gt;Mixed matrix membranes containing two polymorphous cage networks (ZrT-2&#945; and ZrT-2&#946;) were fabricated using a packing engineering approach. Synchrotron X-ray absorption and positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy were employed to differentiate distinct polymorphic structures within the membrane matrix. Gas permeation tests revealed that the corresponding MMMs showed superior CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; separation performance, exceeding the Robeson upper bound.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal-organic cages (MOCs) have been considered as emerging zero-dimensional (0D) porous fillers to generate molecularly homogeneous MOC-based membrane materials. However, the discontinuous pore connectivity and low filler concentrations limit the improvement of membrane separation performance. Herein, we propose the dimension augmentation of MOCs in membranes using three-dimensional (3D) supramolecular MOC networks as filler materials in mixed matrix membranes (MMMs). We further explore the packing engineering of MOC networks to produce distinct polymorphs (&#945; and &#946; phases) for tailoring membrane performance.

         <title>Activating Oxygen via the 3&#8208;Electron Pathway to Hydroxyl Radical by La&#8722;O4 Single&#8208;atom on WO3 for Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selective oxygen activation to hydroxyl radicals via 3&#8197;e&#8722; pathway using single atomically dispersed La based on WO3 fabricated with oxygen vacancies to weaken La&#8722;O coordination strength (denoted as LaO4&#8722;WOv) is achieved. Rapid and complete removal of tetracycline realizes over LaO4&#8722;WOv with 0.077&#8197;min&#8722;1 of rate constant. This work builds a catalyst for manipulating oxygen activation towards water purification as a representative application.







Abstract
Shifting photocatalytic oxygen activation towards 3&#8208;electron (e&#8722;) pathway to hydroxyl radicals, instead of the normal 1&#8197;e&#8722; to superoxide radicals, becomes increasingly important for pollution degradation since hydroxyl radicals possess a high oxidation potential (2.80&#8197;V). Here, we demonstrate a selective oxygen activation to hydroxyl radicals via 3&#8197;e&#8722; pathway using single atomically dispersed La based on WO3 fabricated with oxygen vacancies to weaken La&#8722;O coordination strength (denoted as LaO4&#8722;WOv). Unsaturated&#8208;state La overcomes the rate&#8208;limited step of 2&#8197;e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction towards to hydrogen peroxide via tuning binding free energy of key reaction intermediate *OOH, stepped by easy generation of hydroxyl radicals via 1&#8197;e&#8722;. This strategy alters the activation of oxygen process from 1&#8197;e&#8722; to 3&#8197;e&#8722;. Hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals over LaO4&#8722;WOv produces 3.8 and 3.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, 35 and 8&#8197;times that of detected over WO3, respectively. Rapid and complete removal of tetracycline realizes over LaO4&#8722;WOv with 0.077&#8197;min&#8722;1 of rate constant, 38&#8197;times that of WO3. Degradation efficiencies keep greater than 98&#8201;% following five repeats, revealing a practical&#8208;utilization&#8208;level robust stability. This work builds an unsaturated&#8208;state transition metal site for manipulating oxygen activation towards an effective water purification as a representative application.

We have precisely prepared hierarchical structures using poly(di&#8208;n&#8208;hexylfluorene)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(3&#8208;tetraethylene glycol thiophene) diblock copolymer and polyfluorene&#8208;block&#8208;polythiophene&#8208;block&#8208;poly(phenyl isocyanide) triblock copolymer. In seed growth process, by adjusting the structure of the copolymers and solvent polarity, A&#8722;B&#8208;A triblock, multiarm branched micelles, and raft micelles were successfully formed.







Abstract
The precise preparation of hierarchical micelles is a fundamental challenge in modern materials science and chemistry. Herein, poly(di&#8208;n&#8208;hexylfluorene)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(3&#8208;tetraethylene glycol thiophene) (poly(1m&#8208;b&#8208;2n)) diblock copolymers and polyfluorene&#8208;block&#8208;polythiophene&#8208;block&#8208;poly(phenyl isocyanide) triblock copolymers were synthesized using a one&#8208;pot process via the sequential addition of corresponding monomers using a Ni(II) complex as a single catalyst for living/controlled polymerization. The crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic conjugated poly(1m&#8208;b&#8208;2n) led to the formation of nanofibers with controlled lengths and narrow dispersity. The block copolymers exhibited white, yellow, and red emissions in different self&#8208;assembly states. By using uniform poly(1m&#8208;b&#8208;2n) nanofibers as seeds, introducing the polyfluorene&#8208;block&#8208;polythiophene&#8208;block&#8208;poly(phenyl isocyanide) triblock polymer as a unimer in the seed growth process, and adjusting the structure of the poly(phenyl isocyanide) block and the polarity of self&#8208;assembly solvent, A&#8722;B&#8722;A triblock micelles, multiarm branched micelles, and raft micelles were prepared.

Abstract
The nickel catalyzed multi&#8208;component cross&#8208;electrophile carbonylation which emerges as a powerful and efficient method for constructing diverse ketones has attracted increasing attention of organic chemists. However, the selectivity of this reaction poses a significant challenge. In this work, we have developed a current&#8208;regulated selective nickel&#8208;catalyzed electroreductive cross&#8208;electrophile carbonylation, which offers a direct convergent synthesis of &#946;/&#947;&#8208;hydroxy ketones, which represent pivotal structural motifs found in numerous natural products, bioactive molecules, pharmaceutical compounds, and essential building blocks. A diverse range of multi&#8208;substituted &#946;/&#947;&#8208;hydroxyketones can be accessed with high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity from epoxides, aryl iodides, and a simple CO source (ClCO2Pr). This electroreductive carbonylation strategy exhibits high functional group tolerance and can be applied in late&#8208;stage derivatization of drugs and natural products. Notably, chiral epoxides can be employed as reactants with chirality retention, enabling the synthesis of asymmetric &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketones. Our approach demonstrates a novel electrochemical selectivity&#8208;controlled strategy in multi&#8208;component cross&#8208;electrophile coupling.

         <title>Comediating Adsorption and Electron Transfer via Dual&#8208;Active Site Catalyst Construction for Improving the Treatment of Extraction Wastewater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine and nitrogen co&#8208;doped carbon (FNC) catalyst with dual&#8208;active sites was developed to comediate adsorption and electron transfer. Specially, F site with electron acquisition can transfer electrons provided by di(2&#8208;ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (D2EHPA) enriched at N sites to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), facilitating the continuous generation of hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH).







Abstract
Solvent extraction is widely applied, while extraction wastewater treatment remains a huge challenge because of the stability of extractants. Heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;like catalysis is a promising method, but the short half&#8208;life of hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) generated by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) activation results in unsatisfactory &#8901;OH utilization and organics removal. Herein, an efficient strategy for treating extraction wastewater based on comediating adsorption and electron transfer by fluorine and nitrogen co&#8208;doped carbon (FNC) catalyst with dual&#8208;active site was developed. Specially, N sites adsorb organics and F sites activate H2O2, shortening the migration distance of &#8901;OH. Theoretical calculation and di(2&#8208;ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (D2EHPA) extraction wastewater degradation experiment showed that F site with electron acquisition can transfer electrons provided by electron&#8208;rich D2EHPA enriched at N sites to H2O2, facilitating the continuous generation of &#8901;OH through lowering the energy barrier for H2O2 activation. As a result, 96.49&#8201;% D2EHPA in simulated wastewater and 90.26&#8201;% total organic carbon in real extraction wastewater were removed. Moreover, FNC catalyst exhibited excellent reusability and ionic adaptability, and can be extended to the removal of various extractants. The proposed dual&#8208;active site catalyst provides an effective strategy for Fenton&#8208;like reaction to treat refractory extraction wastewater, promoting sustainable development of solvent extraction industry.

         <title>Single Molecular Dispersion of Crown Ether&#8208;Decorated Cobalt Phthalocyanine on Carbon Nanotubes for Robust CO2 Reduction through Host&#8208;Guest Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Host&#8208;guest interaction between tetra&#8208;crown ether substituted cobalt phthalocyanine and K+ is able to simultaneously eliminate catalyst aggregation and stabilize catalyst/support interfaces, leading to a full utilization of the intrinsic activity of supported molecular catalysts. The catalytic interfaces show unchanged intrinsic activity at all loading conditions, breaking the trade&#8208;off between intrinsic activity and extrinsic activity.







Abstract
Immobilizing molecular catalysts on electro&#8208;conductive supports (for example, multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes, CNTs) represent a promising way to well&#8208;defined catalyst/support interfaces, which has shown appreciable performance for catalytic transformation. However, their full potential is far from achieved due to insufficient utilization of the intrinsic activity for each immobilized molecular catalyst, especially at loadings that should allow decent current densities. In the present work, we discover host&#8211;guest interaction between tetra&#8208;crown ether substituted cobalt phthalocyanine and metal ions, for example K+ ions, not only eliminate catalyst aggregation at immobilization procedures but also reinforce catalyst/support interactions by additional electrostatic attractions under operational conditions. Through simple dip&#8208;coating procedures, a successful single molecular dispersion is achieved. Such a catalyst/electrode interface is stable and can selectively catalyze CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion with Faradaic efficiency over 96%. Importantly, this interface maintains an almost unchanged turnover frequency (TOF) across all loading conditions, implying a full utilization of the intrinsic activity of supported molecular catalysts. Therefore, a simultaneous achievement of high TOF and high current density (TOF of 111&#8197;s&#8722;1 at 38&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) is achieved, in an aqueous H&#8208;type electrolyzer at an overpotential of 570&#8197;mV.

         <title>Hydrogenating Polyethylene Terephthalate into Degradable Polyesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we introduce a simple process capable of converting waste PET into degradable polyester, polyethylene terephthalate&#8208;polyethylene&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedicarboxylate (PET&#8208;PECHD), by partly hydrogenating the aromatic rings (x) into aliphatic ones (y). The polyesters with variable x/y compositions ranging from 100/0 to 0/100 can be achieved, and the molecular weight (Mw) can be maintained when x/y &gt;87/13 due to the nonobvious depolymerization. The PET&#8208;PECHD demonstrates comparable thermal stability and mechanical strength compared to PET, along with superior extensibility, barrier properties, and degradability in mildly acidic, alkaline solutions, and moist soil.







Abstract
The recycling and upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), the most widely used polyester plastic globally, has attracted growing attention concerning its disposal as non&#8208;degradable waste in the natural environment. Transforming end&#8208;of&#8208;life PET into (bio)degradable polyester offers a novel approach to managing its waste. In this study, we introduce a simple process capable of converting waste PET into degradable polyester, polyethylene terephthalate&#8208;polyethylene&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedicarboxylate (PET&#8208;PECHD), by partly hydrogenating the aromatic rings (x) into aliphatic ones (y). The polyesters with variable x/y compositions ranging from 100/0 to 0/100 can be achieved, and the molecular weight (Mw) can be maintained when x/y &gt;87/13 due to the nonobvious depolymerization. Pronounced depolymerization would occur with deeper hydrogenation, which generates a blend of PET&#8208;PECHD and polyethylene&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedicarboxylate (PECHD) with lower Mw, and finally a single&#8208;type polymer PECHD. The PET&#8208;PECHD demonstrates comparable thermal stability and mechanical strength compared to PET, along with superior extensibility, barrier properties, and (bio)degradability in acidic, alkaline solutions, and moist soil. This research highlights the potential for cost&#8208;effective, large&#8208;scale production of degradable polyester from real&#8208;life plastic waste.

         <title>A Piezocatalysis Strategy to Enable Efficient Redox in Solid&#8208;State Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a novel piezocatalysis mechanism in solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;Se and Li&#8722;S batteries using lead zirconate titanate (PZT) as the piezoelectric catalyst. The piezopotential generated by interfacial stress accumulation efficiently drives redox reactions, enhancing battery kinetics and capacity. This piezocatalytic strategy achieved a remarkable discharge capacity of 670.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 in Li&#8722;Se batteries and 1463&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 in Li&#8722;S batteries, providing a promising approach for high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state batteries.







Abstract
Piezocatalysis is considered to be a favorable catalytic technology by utilizing external mechanical stimulation to promote the specific redox reactions. The application of piezocatalysis in batteries is promising but faces formidable challenges. Herein, the operation principles of piezocatalysis were successfully demonstrated by constructing solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;Se and Li&#8722;S battery models with interfacial stress accumulation. Lead zirconate titanate with an ultra&#8208;high piezoelectric coefficient was applied as the piezoelectric catalyst. The uniformity of the dipole orientation in materials was essential for achieving piezocatalysis in batteries. The accumulated high&#8208;stress converts to piezopotential for catalyzing most reaction processes in batteries, while the rapid stress change prevents the internal charge reorganization, ensuring continuous efficient catalysis. The internal stress change alters the internal polarisation strength, driving excess screening charge to participate in the electrochemical reaction. Under piezocatalysis, solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;Se batteries exhibited a initial discharge capacity of 670.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (99.4&#8201;% of the theoretical value) at 0.1&#8197;C, and Li&#8722;S batteries showed a capacity of 1463&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C, which was still maintained up to 1084&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at an elevated rate of 0.5&#8197;C. This piezocatalysis strategy provides a strong theoretical basis and design specification for enhancing Li&#8722;Se and Li&#8722;S battery reaction kinetics.

2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (HBPDC) is incorporated as an interface layer between SnO2 and perovskite layers in PSCs, passivates the surface defects from both the surfaces, and enhances the interfacial adhesion and mechanical reliability. The resulting PSCs exhibited an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.41&#8201;% with improved stability.







Abstract
The regulation of interfaces remains a critical and challenging aspect in the pursuit of highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (HBPDC) is incorporated as an interfacial layer between SnO2 and perovskite layers in PSCs. The two carboxylic acid moieties on HBPDC bind to SnO2 through esterification, while its nitrogen atoms, possessing lone electron pairs, interact with uncoordinated lead (Pb2+) atoms through Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions. This dual functionality enables simultaneous passivation of surface defects on both the SnO2 and buried perovskite layers. In addition, the electron&#8208;deficient nature of HBPDC enhances interfacial energy band alignment and facilitates electron transfer from the perovskite to SnO2. Furthermore, the incorporation of HBPDC strengthens the interfacial adhesion, improving mechanical reliability. As a result, the PSCs exhibited an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.41&#8201;% under standard AM 1.5G conditions, along with remarkable environmental stability.

         <title>Dual Signature of Chirality Induced Spin Selectivity through Spontaneous Resolution of 2D Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>

Herein, we demonstrate the first instance of achieving dual signature of chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity in 2D metal&#8211;organic framework materials, produced from a single and exclusively achiral system through spontaneous resolution method.







Abstract
The Chiral&#8208;Induced Spin Selectivity (CISS) effect has emerged as a fascinating phenomenon within the realm of electron's spin manipulation, showcasing a unique interplay between electron's spin and molecular chirality. Subsequent to its discovery, researchers have been actively involved in exploring the new chiral molecules as effective spin filters. In the realm of observing the CISS effect, the conventional approach has mandated the utilization of two distinct enantiomers of chiral molecules. However, this present study represents a significant advancement by demonstrating the ability to control both spin states of electrons in a single system. In this work, we have demonstrated the preparation of chiral metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) via a &#8220;spontaneous resolution&#8221; process, obviating the requirement for chiral sources. This resulted in the production of chiral crystals exhibiting opposite handedness (1P and 1M) and these crystals were subsequently employed as a new class of spin filters based on CISS effect. Remarkably, this work signifies the first instance of achieving dual signature of spin selectivity from a single and exclusively achiral system through a spontaneous resolution process. This holds immense potential as it facilitates the production of two distinct spin&#8208;filtering materials from a unified system. Furthermore, we investigated the contact potential differences (CPD) of these chiral crystals and, for the first time, associated it with the preferential spin transport properties. Our findings revealed a correlation between the CPD and the chirality of the crystals, as well as the magnetization orientations of the ferromagnetic substrate, which can be elucidated by the CISS effect. In overall, the significant findings achieved using these robust and easily synthesized MOF crystals without the requirement for chiral medium represent a crucial advancement in enhancing the effectiveness of spin filtering materials to produce spintronic devices.

         <title>Advanced Eutectogel Electrolyte for High&#8208;Performance and Wide&#8208;Temperature Flexible Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ChCl/EG&#8208;PVA eutectogel features more and stronger hydrogen bonds and denser polymer networks, resulting in excellent mechanical properties, liquid uptake and retention capabilities. DFT results confirm that Ch+ can be preferentially adsorbs on the Zn surface and effectively inhibit dendrite growth. The flexible zinc&#8208;air battery assembled with eutectogel electrolyte exhibits excellent power density and wide temperature range adaptability.







Abstract
Despite ongoing challenges, achieving further breakthroughs in the development of gel polymer electrolytes with a wide temperature range, excellent liquid retention capability and enhanced anode compatibility in flexible zinc&#8208;air batteries (FZABs) remains a significant objective. This study presents a significant advancement in the development of choline chloride/ethylene glycol&#8208;polyvinyl alcohol (ChCl/EG&#8208;PVA) eutectogel electrolyte, tailored for high&#8208;performance operation across a wide temperature range. Systematic in&#8208;situ and ex&#8208;situ characterizations and theoretical simulations confirm the formation of robust hydrogen bonding and denser polymer cross&#8208;linked networks within the prepared eutectogel, leading to enhanced liquid retention ability (93.7&#8201;% after 96&#8197;h exposure to air) and ion transport capacity (ionic conductivity of 171.3&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1). Additionally, the zincophilicity nature of the choline cation in eutectogel effectively suppresses dendrites growth. The assembled FZAB utilizing this eutectogel electrolyte achieves a peak power density of 109.3&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a cycle life of 90&#8197;h. Notably, the power density of FZAB is maintained as high as 38.2&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C and 63.2&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 50&#8201;&#176;C, demonstrating its prominent suitability for applications in extreme temperature conditions. The design of eutectogel provides a novel way to achieve the high&#8208;performance FZAB.

         <title>Examining the Impact of 3D Multi&#8208;Arm Small Molecules on PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6 Blend Reveals the Key Requirements for Their Electronic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations, we inspected the molecular&#8208;scale impact that a benzotriazole&#8208;based 3D four&#8208;arm small molecule has on the local morphology and electronic properties of PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6 blends. Detailed examination of these aspects allowed us to highlight key requirements that the electronic properties of 3D multi&#8208;arm small molecules need to fulfill in order to improve device efficiency.







Abstract
While the emergence of PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6 active layer re&#8208;energized the organic photovoltaic community, excessive aggregation of Y6 molecules induced by their strong intermolecular interactions has limited the performance of PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6&#8208;based organic solar cells (OSCs). Adding 3D multi&#8208;arm small&#8208;molecule acceptors is an effective strategy to inhibit such aggregation. However, to maximize OSC efficiency, these molecules should also contribute to the electronic processes. Here, by taking a benzotriazole&#8208;based 3D four&#8208;arm small molecule (i.e., SF&#8208;BTA1) as representative example, we combine molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations to examine the molecular&#8208;scale impact of 3D multi&#8208;arm small molecules on morphological characteristics (especially at the nanoscale) and electronic properties of PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6 blends. By considering the intermolecular packing distances, density, and patterns among PM6, Y6, and SF&#8208;BTA1 components, exciton transfer rates from SF&#8208;BTA1 to Y6 or PM6, charge transfer rates from Y6 or PM6 to SF&#8208;BTA1, electron/hole transfer rates among adjacent Y6/PM6 pairs, and radiative and non&#8208;radiative recombination processes, we draw a comprehensive picture that describes how 3D multi&#8208;arm small molecules improve morphological and electronic properties of PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6 blends and thus the OSC efficiency. Furthermore, successful rationalization of these aspects allows us to point out key requirements regarding the electronic properties of 3D multi&#8208;arm small molecules.

         <title>Multi&#8208;N&#8208;Heterocycle Donor&#8208;Acceptor Conjugated Amphoteric Organic Superstructures for Superior Zinc Batteries</title>

Multi&#8208;N&#8208;heterocycle donor&#8208;acceptor conjugated amphoteric organic superstructures provide high&#8208;density accessible n&#8208;type triazines and p&#8208;type piperazines, achieving high&#8208;capacity and high&#8208;kinetics organic cathode via a two&#8208;step 18&#8197;e&#8722; anion&#8211;cation coordination reaction. Integrated high discharge voltage and structure stability give the Zn&#8208;organic battery record energy density and cycle life (412&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and 70,000 cycles).







Abstract
Multiple redox&#8208;active amphoteric organics with more n&#8208;p fused electron transfer is an ongoing pursuit for superior zinc&#8211;organic batteries (ZOBs). Here we report multi&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;site donor&#8208;acceptor conjugated amphoteric organic superstructures (AOSs) by integrating three&#8208;electron&#8208;accepting n&#8208;type triazine motifs and dual&#8208;electron&#8208;donating p&#8208;type piperazine units via H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. AOSs expose flower&#8208;shaped N&#8208;heteromacrocyclic electron delocalization topologies to promise full accessibility of built&#8208;in n&#8208;p redox&#8208;active motifs with an ultralow activation energy, thus liberating superior capacity (465&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) for Zn||AOSs battery. More importantly, the extended multiple donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;fused conjugated AOSs feature satisfied discharge voltage and anti&#8208;dissolution in electrolytes, pushing both the energy density and cycle life of the ZOBs to a new level (412&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and 70,000 cycles@10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). An anion&#8211;cation hybrid 18&#8197;e&#8722; charge storage mechanism is rationalized for heteromacrocyclic modules of AOSs cathode, entailing six tert&#8208;N motifs coupling with CF3SO3&#8722; ions at high potential and twelve imine sites coordinating with Zn2+ ions at low potential. These findings constitute a major advance of amphoteric multielectron organic materials and stand for a good starting point for advanced ZOBs.

         <title>Strong Replaces Weak: Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Anchored Electrolyte Enabling Ultra&#8208;Stable and Wide&#8208;Temperature Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Capacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>

We report a hydrogen bond&#8208;anchored electrolyte by introducing sulfolane to reconstruct hydrogen&#8208;bond network, solvation structure and contribute to excellent temperature adaptability. The hydrogen bond network in free water is significantly weakened, while that between sulfolane and water is highly strengthened. The zinc&#8208;ion capacitor shows remarkable cycling stability over 55000 cycles and excellent temperature adaptability from &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C to 60&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Despite aqueous electrolytes offer a great opportunity for large&#8208;scale energy storage owing to their safety and cost&#8208;effectiveness, their practical application suffers from the parasitic side reactions and poor temperature adaptability stemming from weak hydrogen&#8208;bond (HB) network in free water. Here, we propose the guiding thought &#8220;strong replaces weak&#8221; to design hydrogen bond&#8208;anchored electrolyte by introducing sulfolane (SL) for disrupting the regular weak HB network and contributing to superior temperature tolerance. Judiciously combined experimental characterization and theoretical calculation confirm that SL can remodel the primary solvation shell of metal ions, customize stable electrode interface chemistry and restrain the side reactions. Consequently, symmetric supercapacitor constructed by activated carbon (AC) electrodes is able to fully work within a voltage range of 2.4&#8197;V and reach high capacitance retention of 89.8&#8201;% after 60000 cycles. Additionally, Zn anodes exhibit ultra&#8208;stable Zn plating/stripping behaviors and a wide temperature range (&#8722;20&#8211;60&#8201;&#176;C), and zinc&#8208;ion capacitor (Zn//AC) also delivers an excellent cycling stability with capacity retention of 99.7&#8201;% after 55000 cycles, implying that the designed electrolyte has practical application potential in extreme environments. This work proposes a novel critical solvation strategy that paves the route for the construction of ultra&#8208;stable and wide&#8208;temperature aqueous energy storage devices.

         <title>Solvation Effect&#8208;Determined Mechanisms of Cation Exchange Reactions for Efficient Multicomponent Nanocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>

We first reveal the significance of structural evolution of target ion for CE on experimentally and theoretically, breaking the traditional etch&#8208;adsorption mechanism. Moreover, this mechanism is validated for other metal ion. The Pt&#8208;free CoRuSn(OH)x produced via CE displays a mass activity and a power density for anion exchange membrane fuel cell.







Abstract
Cation exchange (CE) reaction is a classical synthesis method for creating complex structures. A lock of study on intrinsic mechanism limits its understanding and practical application. Using X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, we observed that the evolution from Ru&#8722;Cl to Ru&#8722;O/OH occurs during the CE between K2RuCl6 and CoSn(OH)6 in aqueous solution, while CE between K2PtCl6 and CoSn(OH)6 is inhibited due to the failure of structural evolution from Pt&#8722;Cl to Pt&#8722;O/OH. Theoretical simulations imply that the interaction between Ru&#8722;O and CoSn(OH)6 with Co vacancy (CoVCoSn(OH)6) endows the electron transfer, as a result of strengthened adsorption on CoVCoSn(OH)6. Moreover, this mechanism is validated for CE between K2RuCl6 and ASn(OH)6 (A=Mg, Ca, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn), and CE between K2PdCl6/Na3RhCl6/K2IrCl6 and CoSn(OH)6. Impressively, the Pt&#8208;free CoRuSn(OH)x produced via CE displays a mass activity and a power density of 15.0&#8197;A&#8201;mgRu&#8722;1 and 11.6&#8197;W&#8201;mgRu&#8722;1, respectively, for anion exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC) exceeding the values of commercial PtRu/C (11.8&#8197;A&#8201;mgRu+Pt&#8722;1 and 9.0&#8197;W&#8201;mgRu+Pt&#8722;1). This work, for the first time, reveals the intrinsic mechanism of CE as structural evolution of target ion breaking through the traditional classic etch&#8208;adsorption mechanism and will promote fundamental research and practical application in various fields.

         <title>Crystallization&#8208;Induced Dimerization and Solution&#8208;Phase Bond Dissociation of Stable Dibenzoolympicenyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of stable nonplanar dibenzoolympicenyl radicals that exhibited a regioselective radical&#8211;radical coupling reaction when crystallized were synthesized. A homocoupling reaction was preferred when two different monoradicals were cocrystallized. Bond dissociation occurred in the solution upon either heating or irradiation with light, thus rendering the dimerization a controllable and reversible process.







Abstract
Crystallization of organic materials can lead to different assembly structure with different reactivity, but this phenomenon is rarely observed for delocalized hydrocarbon radicals. This report introduces a crystallization&#8208;induced radical&#8211;radical coupling reaction, which employs a series of stable nonplanar organic &#960;&#8208;radicals as reactants. Six stable radical congeners are synthesized, resulting in radical&#8211;radical coupling at the allenyl radical site during crystallization to produce close&#8208;shell dimers. This coupling reaction is absent in the solution phase, which highlights the importance of preorganization in the lattice. Remarkably, the attempts of cocrystallization of different congeners yielded homocoupling products instead of cross&#8208;coupling products. In specific cases, two distinct polymorphs are observed and their reactivity is different according to the distance of the reaction sites. Theoretical calculations indicate that the transition from a metastable preorganized monomer to a dimer is barrierless and spontaneous. The dimer could regenerate free radicals by heating or photoirradiation in the solution phase. This discovery may lead to controllable molecular switches.

A homocoupling reaction was preferred when two different monoradicals were cocrystallized. Bond dissociation occurred in the solution upon either heating or irradiation with light, thus rendering the dimerization a controllable and reversible process.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crystallization of organic materials can lead to different assembly structure with different reactivity, but this phenomenon is rarely observed for delocalized hydrocarbon radicals. This report introduces a crystallization-induced radical&#8211;radical coupling reaction, which employs a series of stable nonplanar organic &#960;-radicals as reactants. Six stable radical congeners are synthesized, resulting in radical&#8211;radical coupling at the allenyl radical site during crystallization to produce close-shell dimers. This coupling reaction is absent in the solution phase, which highlights the importance of preorganization in the lattice. Remarkably, the attempts of cocrystallization of different congeners yielded homocoupling products instead of cross-coupling products. In specific cases, two distinct polymorphs are observed and their reactivity is different according to the distance of the reaction sites. Theoretical calculations indicate that the transition from a metastable preorganized monomer to a dimer is barrierless and spontaneous. The dimer could regenerate free radicals by heating or photoirradiation in the solution phase. This discovery may lead to controllable molecular switches.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ferrocene&#8208;Functionalized Atomically Precise Metal Clusters Exhibit Synergistically Enhanced Performance for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomically precise cluster catalyst (Ag9Cu6) integrated with alkynylferrocene (Ag9Cu6&#8208;Fc) was synthesized. This hybrid catalyst design facilitates continuous electron transfer, creating a unique chemical environment that enhances CO2 electroreduction. Ag9Cu6&#8208;Fc achieves a CO Faradaic efficiency of 100&#8201;% and a CO partial current density of &#8722;680&#8197;mA/cm2, significantly outperforming Ag9Cu6 without ferrocene functionalization.







Abstract
The integration of organometallic compounds with metal nanoparticles can, in principle, generate hybrid nanocatalysts endowed with augmented functionality, presenting substantial promise for catalytic applications. Herein, we synthesize an atomically precise metal cluster (Ag9Cu6) catalyst integrated with alkynylferrocene molecules (Ag9Cu6&#8208;Fc). This hybrid catalyst design facilitates a continuous electron transfer channel via an ethynyl bridge and establishes a distinctive local chemical environment, resulting in remarkably enhanced catalytic activity in CO2 electroreduction. The Ag9Cu6&#8208;Fc catalyst achieves a record&#8208;high product selectivity of CO Faradaic efficiency of 100&#8201;% and an industrial&#8208;level CO partial current density of &#8722;680&#8197;mA/cm2, surpassing the performance of the Ag9Cu6 cluster (62&#8201;% and &#8722;230&#8197;mA/cm2, respectively) without ferrocene functionalization in a membrane electrode assembly cell. Operando experimental and computational findings offer valuable insights into the role of ferrocene functionalization in synergistically improving the catalytic performance of metal clusters, propelling the advancement of metallic&#8208;organometallic hybrid nanoparticles for energy conversion technologies.

         <title>A Highly Conjugated Nickel(II)&#8208;Acetylide Framework for Efficient Photocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly conjugated nickel(II)&#8208;acetylide frameworks were prepared for the first time and demonstrated excellent performance in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. The synergistic effects of the pyrenyl and Ni&#8208;bis(acetylide) moieties facilitated effective electron transfer, contributing to the activation of CO2 and the stabilization of the active intermediates.







Abstract
The incorporation of transition&#8208;metal single atoms as molecular functional entities into the skeleton of graphdiyne (GDY) to construct novel two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8208;acetylide frameworks, known as metalated graphynes (MGYs), is a promising strategy for developing efficient catalysts, which can combine the tunable charge transfer of GDY frameworks, the catalytic activity of metal and the precise distribution of single metallic centers. Herein, four highly conjugated MGY photocatalysts based on NiII, PdII, PtII, and HgII were synthesized for the first time using the &#8216;bottom&#8208;up&#8217; strategy through the use of M&#8722;C bonds (&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;M&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;). Remarkably, the NiII&#8208;based graphyne (TEPY&#8208;Ni&#8208;GY) exhibited the highest CO generation rate of 18.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a selectivity of 98.8&#8201;%. This superior performance is attributed to the synergistic effects of pyrenyl and &#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;Ni(PBu3)2&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8211; moieties. The pyrenyl block functions as an intramolecular &#960;&#8208;conjugation channel, facilitating kinetically favorable electron transfer, while the &#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;Ni(PBu3)2&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722; moiety serves as the catalytic site that enhances CO2 adsorption and activation, thereby suppressing competitive hydrogen evolution. This study provides a new perspective on MGY&#8208;based photocatalysts for developing highly active and low&#8208;cost catalysts for CO2 reduction.

         <title>Dual Zn5&#8722;NiS4 Sites in a Redox&#8208;Active Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Enables Efficient Cascade Catalysis for Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Conversion</title>

         <dc:description>
A new catalytic mechanism for efficiently cascading electrocatalytic nitrate reduction was studied in the redox&#8208;active metal&#8211;organic frameworks featuring a pentanuclear Zinc cluster and Ni&#8208;bis(dithiolene). The Zn5 cluster centre selectively reduces nitrate to nitrite, and the [NiS4] unit mimics nitrite reductase, facilitating the highly efficient conversion of nitrite to ammonia. This system effectively suppresses hydrogen evolution reactions and decouples the intermediate steps in the nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion, while optimizing the kinetics of consecutive hydrogenation of reaction intermediates through a highly conductive pathway, leading to highly efficient green electrochemical ammonia synthesis.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia (NO3RR) offers a promising solution to both environmental pollution and the sustainable energy conversion. Here we propose an efficient cascade catalytic mechanism based on a dual Zn5&#8722;NiS4 sites, orderly assembled in a redox&#8208;active metal&#8211;organic framework structure, which separately promotes the reaction kinetics of nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;nitrite and nitrite&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversions. Specifically, the Zn5 clusters adsorb and selectively reduce the NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722;, whereas [NiS4] acts as an analogue to the ferredoxins, subsequently boosts the reduction of NO2&#8722; to produce NH3. To this end, the bimetallic Zn5&#8722;NiS4TP MOF was synthesized based on the redox&#8208;active ligand [Ni(C2S2(TPCOOH)2)2]. A maximum ammonia production rate of 23477.59&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mg&#8722;1cat. and faradaic efficiency 92.87&#8201;% was achived by Zn5&#8722;NiS4TP MOF under neutral conditions. To validate the critical role of dual Zn5&#8722;NiS4 sites, Mn5&#8722;NiS4TP and Cd2&#8722;NiS4TP were synthesized as control samples, together with Zn&#8208;TTFTB, Zn&#8722;NiS4Ph and other Zn5&#8208;cluster&#8208;based MOFs applied for the investigation of electrocatalytic nitrate reduction. Our results indicated that substitution by &#8208;thienyl instead of &#8208;phenyl group increases the S&#8208;heteroatom content, improves the conductivity and facilitates electron transfer. Furthermore, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations of the energy changes for the reduction of each species could rationalize experimental results.

         <title>Paired Electro&#8208;Synthesis of Remote Amino Alcohols with/in H2O</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a groundbreaking electrochemical ring&#8208;opening protocol for the direct synthesis of remote amino alcohols via copper&#8208;catalyzed sequential paired electrolysis under mild, biocompatible conditions. This method enables rapid access to a wide variety of remote amino alcohols with diverse functional groups, utilizing an electro&#8208;redox ring&#8208;opening approach for efficient peptide alcohol modification and assembly. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations confirm that water serves as both the solvent and hydrogen source, generating CuH to reduce aldehydes to alcohols.







Abstract
Amino alcohols, particularly remote amino alcohols and peptide alcohols, are valuable due to their functional diversity in biologically active compounds. However, traditional synthesis methods face significant challenges, making electrochemistry an attractive alternative. We have developed a mild and biocompatible sequential paired electrolysis strategy, leveraging copper&#8208;electrocatalysis to synthesize diverse remote amino alcohols, including unnatural peptide alcohols. Both experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that water serves as both the hydroxyl source and the solvent, facilitating the generation of CuH with Cu(I) at the cathode, which in turn reduces the aldehyde intermediates formed during the reaction.

Small molecule modulators are essential for probing protein function, but their development is often limited by complex synthesis. We introduce a simple, one&#8208;step method to create multifunctional modulators. We developed a library for human 15&#8208;lipoxygenase&#8208;1, including probes, sensors, photocrosslinkers, and inhibitors. Our technology shows promise for complex biological applications, demonstrated by successful protein inhibition and labeling in vitro, in cellulo, and in vivo.







Abstract
Small molecule modulators are powerful tools for selectively probing and manipulating proteins in native biological systems. However, the development of versatile modulators that exhibit desired properties is hindered by the lack of a rapid and robust synthetic strategy. Here, we develop a facile and reliable one&#8208;step methodology for the generation of multifunctional toolboxes encompassing a wide variety of chemical modulators with different desired features. These modulators bind irreversibly to the protein target via a selective warhead. Key elements are introduced onto the warhead in a single step using multi&#8208;component reactions. To illustrate the power of this new technology, we synthesized a library of diverse modulators designed to explore a highly challenging and poorly understood protein, human 15&#8208;lipoxygenase&#8208;1. Modulators made include; activity&#8208;based/photoaffinity probes, chemosensors, photocrosslinkers, as well as light&#8208;controlled and high&#8208;affinity inhibitors. The efficacy of our compounds was successfully established through the provision of on demand inhibition and labeling of our target protein in vitro, in cellulo and in vivo; thus, proving that this technology has promising potential for applications in many complex biological systems.

         <title>On the Stability of Metastable Monomers to Bias the Supramolecular Polymerization of Naphthalendiimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>

The synthesis of the NDIs 1&#8211;3 endowed with peripheral benzamide units and a variable number of 1,2,3&#8208;triazole rings is reported. Both the benzamide units and the triazole rings can form six&#8208; or seven&#8208;membered intramolecularly H&#8208;bonded pseudocycles that retard their supramolecular polymerization. A detailed experimental and theoretical study display the different non&#8208;covalent supramolecular forces operating in the stabilization of such M* species.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of the naphthalendiimides (NDIs) 1&#8211;3 endowed with peripheral 3,4,5&#8208;trialkoxybenzamide units and a variable number of 1,2,3&#8208;triazole rings. Both the benzamide units and the triazole rings are able to form six&#8208; or seven&#8208;membered intramolecularly H&#8208;bonded pseudocycles that behave as metastable monomeric units. Whilst freshly prepared solutions of 1&#8211;3 afford H&#8208;type aggregates, the presence or lack of the 1,2,3&#8208;triazole rings strongly conditions the kinetics and stability of the resulting aggregated species. These structural features result in highly stable metastable monomeric species M* for the symmetric 2 that can be trapped for long periods of time when the sample is subject to a heating/cooling cycle. Contrary to NDI 2, the M* species formed by 1 and 3 evolve to the final supramolecular polymers in shorter times. A detailed experimental and theoretical study display the different non&#8208;covalent supramolecular forces operating in the stabilization of such M* species. In all cases, but especially in those NDIs endowed with the triazoles rings (NDIs 2 and 3), a number of conformers for the metastable monomeric units can be modelled. The high stability of such monomeric species justifies the delay in the formation of the H&#8208;type aggregates.

         <title>Induced Charge&#8208;Compensation Effect for Boosting Photocatalytic Water Splitting in Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structurally similar building blocks with different electron affinity were employed as linkers for constructing zinc&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The charge compensation effect of strong electron&#8208;donating thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene unit enables electron delocalization of imine linkage, which facilitates the charge separation and transfer, endowing resultant COF with superior photocatalytic water splitting performance.







Abstract
Imine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising for photocatalytic water splitting, but their performance is often constrained by inefficient charge separation due to the high electron localization nature of polar imine bonds. In this study, we have optimized the electron delocalization across the imine linkage within a COF by implementing a charge compensation effect. This effect is achieved when a strong electron&#8208;donating thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene linker is directly attached to the iminic carbon of a zinc&#8208;porphyrinic COF. This modification significantly reduces the electron binding effect within the imine bonds of the COF, facilitating both in&#8208;plane charge separation and out&#8208;plane charge transfer to the catalytic site. Conversely, the use of strong electron&#8208;withdrawing pyrizine linker aggravates the electron localization at the imine linkage in the ZnP&#8722;Pz variant. Consequently, ZnP&#8722;Tt shows a substantially improved photocatalytic water&#8208;splitting activity under visible light irradiation, with a hydrogen evolution of 44288&#177;2280&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 in 4&#8197;h, which exceeds the ZnP&#8722;Pz counterpart by a factor of 10. These results offer fresh perspectives for the design of imine&#8208;based COFs to overcome their limitations in charge separation efficiency.

         <dc:description>
Towards straightforward and efficient preparations of ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides/proteins, here we reported a chemical O&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylation reaction. Promoted by the cocktail of ionic liquids, the reaction proceeds highly efficiently, achieving yields of up to 94&#8201;% with &#945;&#8201;:&#8201;&#946; ratios ranging from 88&#8201;:&#8201;12 to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1, and tunable stereoselectivity. This method significantly simplifies the production of ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides/proteins from NAD+, enabling multi&#8208;purpose applications.

ADP&#8208;ribosylation is a complex post&#8208;translational modification involved in key physiological processes and associated with various health and disease states. The growing interest in ADP&#8208;ribosylation necessitates straightforward and efficient synthetic methods for the preparation of ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides/proteins. In this study, we report a facile reaction between nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and alcohols promoted by a combination of ionic liquids, yielding up to 94&#8201;% with &#945;&#8201;:&#8201;&#946; ratios ranging from 88&#8201;:&#8201;12 to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 and a switchable configuration selectivity. This method significantly simplifies the production of ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides and proteins, enabling diverse applications. It allows detailed investigation of side&#8208;chain structure&#8211;activity relationships, facilitates two&#8208;step clickable conjugation of ADP&#8208;ribosyl groups to proteins, and, for the first time, enables non&#8208;enzymatic synthesis of well&#8208;defined ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides/proteins from natural counterparts and NAD+.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterizations of Dibenzo&#8208;Fused Perioctacene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dibenzoperioctacene (DBPO) with extended zigzag edges was synthesized and characterized. While the bond length analysis indicated a possible open&#8208;shell nature of DBPO, variable&#8208;temperature NMR analysis indicated its closed&#8208;shell character. The theoretical investigations revealed the DBPO has nearly degenerate closed&#8208;shell and open&#8208;shell singlet states with a large singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap.







Abstract
Dibenzoperioctacene (DBPO) with extended zigzag edges was synthesized and unambiguously characterized by a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), mass spectrometry, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Variable&#8208;temperature (VT) NMR analysis indicated the closed&#8208;shell character of DBPO, yet the bond lengths in the single&#8208;crystal structure of DBPO aligned more closely with those of open&#8208;shell teranthene than closed&#8208;shell bisanthene. Spin&#8208;unrestricted density functional theory (DFT) calculations using various methods supported that ground state of DBPO might be on the borderline between closed&#8208; and open&#8208;shell singlet states, with a large singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST), consistent with the VT&#8197;NMR and bond&#8208;length analyses. UV/Vis&#8208;near infrared (NIR) absorption spectrum showed the longest&#8208;wavelength peak at 905&#8197;nm, marking the NIR optical properties of DBPO. DBPO exhibited a tendency to react with atmospheric oxygen, which additionally hinted at its possible open&#8208;shell character. Furthermore, the oxidized species of non&#8208;fluorescent DBPO exhibited strong emission at 820 and 915&#8197;nm.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing a synergistic &#960;&#8208;extension and peripheral&#8208;locking strategy, we constructed a high&#8208;order B/N&#8208;based pure&#8208;green MR&#8208;TADF emitter via a lithium&#8208;free synthetic approach. The associated device achieved narrowband emission with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 20&#8197;nm, CIE coordinates of (0.18, 0.74), a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 36.6&#8201;% with minimal efficiency roll&#8208;off, and a lifetime (LT80) of 485&#8197;hours at an initial luminance of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters offer natural advantages for creating power&#8208;efficient, wide&#8208;color&#8208;gamut OLEDs. However, current green MR&#8208;TADF emitters face challenges in simultaneously achieving high color purity and efficient reverse inter&#8208;system crossing (RISC), leading to suboptimal device performance. In this study, we propose a synergistic molecular design approach that combines &#960;&#8208;extension and peripheral locking to address these challenges. This approach allows for the construction of quadruple borylated MR&#8208;TADF emitters that not only deliver precisely tuned pure&#8208;green emission with a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 15&#8197;nm, but also exhibit close&#8208;to&#8208;unity quantum yield, rapid RISC, and optimal horizontal dipole orientation. The resulting sensitizer&#8208;free OLED approaches the BT.2020 standard with CIE coordinates of (0.18, 0.74) and demonstrates impressive external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 36.6&#8201;% at maximum and 31.8&#8201;% at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. Additionally, the device shows good operational stability, with a lifetime (LT80) of 485&#8197;hours at an initial luminance of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. This study hence offers a promising molecular design strategy that effectively enhances the comprehensive OLED performance.

         <title>CdWO4 Sub&#8208;1 nm Nanowires for Visible&#8208;Light CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first CdWO4 sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm nanowires with rich surface absorbed oleylamine, PO43&#8722;&#8208;doping and oxygen defects are successfully prepared. The effects of surface adsorption of oleylamine, PO43&#8722;&#8208;doping and oxygen defects on their electronic structure, light absorption and photocatalytic performance are systematically investigated. This work expands our understanding on the physicochemical and catalytic properties of sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm materials.







Abstract
Quantum size effect usually causes energy level splitting and band broadening as material size decreases. However, this may change again by the surface adsorbents, doping and defects, which rarely attracts much attention. Herein, CdWO4 sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm nanowires (SNWs) with oleylamine adsorption, PO43&#8722;&#8208;doping and oxygen defects are synthesized by combining Cd(CH3COO)2, H3PW12O40 (PW12) and oleylamine (abbreviated as PO43&#8722;&#8208;CdWO4&#8208;X SNWs). Compared with bulk CdWO4, they exhibit unexpected absorption spectra (extended from 292&#8197;nm to 453&#8197;nm) and band gap (reduced from 4.25&#8197;eV to 2.74&#8197;eV), thus bringing remarkable visible&#8208;light CO2 photoreduction activity. Under 410&#8197;nm LED light irradiation, PO43&#8722;&#8208;CdWO4&#8208;40 SNWs exhibit the highest photocatalytic performance with a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO generation rate of 1685&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate the adsorbed oleylamine raises the valence band and enhances the adsorption of reaction substrate and intermediates, thus decreasing their reduction energy barriers. Furthermore, PO43&#8722;&#8208;doping and oxygen defects will generate defect energy band below the conduction band of PO43&#8722;&#8208;CdWO4&#8208;40 SNWs, resulting in remarkable visible light absorption and superior photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance. This work highlights the significant impacts of surface adsorbents, doping and defects on the physicochemical and catalytic properties of sub&#8208;nano materials.

         <title>Switchable Radical Polymerization of &#945;&#8208;Olefins via Remote Hydrogen Atom or Group Transfer for Enhanced Battery Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A switchable radical polymerization of &#945;&#8208;olefins via remote hydrogen atom or group transfer is disclosed. This novel strategy enables the precise construction of a diverse array of polyethylene&#8208;based polymers with AAB or ABC sequences. The obtained polymer can be used as an interphase layer material in anode&#8208;free Li metal battery, which effectively improves the cycling stability of the battery and demonstrates its potential in energy storage applications.







Abstract
Introducing polar groups into non&#8208;polar polyolefins can significantly enhance the important properties of materials. However, producing polyolefin backbones consisting of polar blocks remains elusive, due to the substantial difference of reactivity ratios between polar and non&#8208;polar olefin monomers in radical polymerization or the poisoning of transition&#8208;metal catalysts by polar groups in coordination polymerization. Herein we present a practical way for the preparation of polyethylene&#8208;based polymers with distinct polar groups by radical polymerization of &#945;&#8208;olefins. A strategy of switchable remote hydrogen atom or group transfer is devised, leading to a diverse range of AAB or ABC sequence&#8208;defined carbon&#8208;chain polyolefins. The utility of these polymers is demonstrated by using poly(ethyl 2&#8208;cyanohept&#8208;6&#8208;enoate) (P2) as an interphase layer material in anode&#8208;free Li metal battery, which effectively improves the cycling stability of the battery and indicates its potential in energy storage applications.

         <title>Shielding Fluoride Ion Basicity through Diurea Coordination for Nonaqueous Fluoride Shuttle Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strong basicity of fluoride ions leads to detrimental side reactions on organic cations and solvents, converting &#8220;naked&#8221; F&#8722; into bifluoride (HF2&#8722;) ions. In this work, dual 1,3&#8208;diphenylurea (DPU) ligands shield the Lewis basicity of F&#8722; through hydrogen bonding, providing long&#8208;term chemical stability across a wide range of aprotic solvents and sustaining improved electrochemical performance in nonaqueous fluoride ion batteries.







Abstract
The strong basicity of fluoride ions leads to detrimental nucleophilic attack on organic components in the electrolytes, such as &#946;&#8208;hydrogen elimination reactions with organic cations and solvents, converting &#8220;naked&#8221; F&#8722; into corrosive and unstable bifluoride (HF2&#8722;) ions. These reactions significantly constrain the choice of suitable solvents and salts to develop electro(chemical) stable fluoride ion electrolytes. In this work, we replaced the triple water ligands typically present in industrial organic fluoride salts with dual 1,3&#8208;diphenylurea (DPU) coordination via hydrogen bonding interaction. This modification successfully suppressed the Lewis basicity of fluoride ions, providing long&#8208;term chemical stability (over 1000&#8197;hours) across a wide range of aprotic solvents, a broadened electrochemical stability window (&#8722;2.5&#8211;0.9&#8197;V vs. Ag+/Ag) and high ionic conductivity (1.7&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1) at room temperature. Additionally, the weaker hydrogen bonding in F&#8722;&#8208;DPU coordination, compared to the conventional boron&#8208;based anion acceptor (AA) strategy that relies on intensive Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions, facilitates faster (de)fluorination kinetics at the electrode. The proposed room temperature fluoride ion batteries sustain improved electrochemical performance by pairing with the Pb&#8208;PbF2 anode and BiF3 or Ag cathode.

         <title>Skeletal Nitrogen Functionalization of Isostructural 2D Conjugated MOFs for Enhancement of the Dual&#8208;Ion Storage Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A skeletal nitrogen introduction strategy has been developed to fine&#8208;tune the dual&#8208;ion storage properties of isostructural 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs). The faradaic charge storage in isostructural MOFs can be improved by introducing additional aromatic nitrogen sites which synergistically act as cation adsorption sites and favor anion&#8208;adsorption to the metal sites energetically.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) are emerging as promising electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage devices. However, a viable path to realize superior dual&#8208;ion storage in 2D c&#8208;MOFs has remained elusive. Here, we report the synthesis of Cu2(Nx&#8722;OHPTP) 2D c&#8208;MOFs (x=0,1,2; OHPTP=octahydroxyphenanthrotriphenylene) with precise aromatic carbon&#8208;nitrogen arrangements, based on the &#960;&#8208;conjugated OHPTP ligand incorporated with one or two nitrogen atoms. The skeletal nitrogen modification in Cu2(Nx&#8722;OHPTP) allows the synergistic introduction of additional redox sites, and thus substantially favors the unique dual&#8208;ion adsorption capacity. Consequently, the Cu2(N2&#8722;OHPTP) cathode exhibits a largely enhanced electrochemical performance for dual&#8208;ion storage (i.e., Li+ and Cl&#8208;) with a high specific capacity of 53.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is twice that of Cu2(N0&#8722;OHPTP) and 1.3&#8197;times that of Cu2(N1&#8722;OHPTP). Furthermore, the Cu2(N2&#8722;OHPTP) electrode displays a favorable rate performance of 52&#8201;% and good cycling stability of 96&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;cycles. We identify N&#8208;centered redox sites as additional Li+ adsorption sites by combining ex situ and in situ spectroscopy measurements and theoretical calculations. In addition, calculations underline the synergistic enhancement of the Cl&#8722; adsorption energy by about 1.0&#8197;eV at the more electron&#8208;poor CuO4 linkages after N&#8208;incorporation. This work paves the way for the precise design of 2D c&#8208;MOFs with superior electrochemical properties, advancing their application in dual&#8208;ion storage applications.

         <title>Flux Synthesis of Robust Polyimide Covalent Organic Frameworks with High&#8208;Density Redox Sites for Efficient Proton Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new rich nitrogen triazole&#8208;based monomer was used to fabricate two highly crystalline, porous and robust polyimide COFs with high&#8208;density redox&#8208;active groups through a flux synthesis method for proton batteries. The COF electrodes delivered a high reversible capacity, superior rate performance, and outstanding long&#8208;term stability, and the full cell with the COF anode and the MnO2 cathode achieved both a high energy and power density.







Abstract
Aqueous proton batteries are attracting increasing attention in the large&#8208;scale next&#8208;generation energy storage field. However, the electrode materials for proton batteries often suffer from low specific capacity and unsatisfactory cycle durability. Herein, we synthesize two highly crystalline and robust polyimide covalent organic frameworks (COFs) through a solvent&#8208;free flux synthesis approach with benzoic acid as a flux and catalyst. The as&#8208;synthesized COFs possess enriched redox&#8208;active sites for proton storage and intrinsic Grotthuss proton conduction, rendering them ideal candidates for proton electrode materials. The optimal COF electrodes achieve a high specific capacity of 180&#8197;mAh/g at 0.1&#8197;A/g, among the highest COF&#8208;based proton batteries, and exhibit an outstanding rate capability of up to 100&#8197;A/g and long&#8208;term cycling stability with capacity retention of 99&#8201;% after 5000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;A/g. The assembled full cells deliver a specific capacity of 150&#8197;mAh/g at 0.2&#8197;A/g with a maximum energy density of 72&#8197;Wh/kg and a maximum supercapacitor&#8208;level power density of 64&#8197;kW/kg, surpassing all reported COF&#8208;based systems. This work paves a new avenue for the design of electrode materials for aqueous proton batteries with high energy density, power density, rate capability and long&#8208;term cycling stability.

The assembled full cells deliver a specific capacity of 150&#8197;mAh/g at 0.2&#8197;A/g with a maximum energy density of 72&#8197;Wh/kg and a maximum supercapacitor-level power density of 64&#8197;kW/kg, surpassing all reported COF-based systems. This work paves a new avenue for the design of electrode materials for aqueous proton batteries with high energy density, power density, rate capability and long-term cycling stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrostatic Confinement&#8208;Induced Excited Charge Transfer in Ionic Covalent Organic Framework Promoting CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrostatic confinement&#8208;induced excited charge transfer pathway is demonstrated in supramolecular photosystem composing of an ionic covalent organic framework and cationic metal complexes. The electrostatic confinement enables an attraction of metal cations to COF to effectively accept photogenerated electrons, while maintaining their homogeneous catalytic properties, achieving an enhancement of photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance.







Abstract
We demonstrate an electrostatic confinement&#8208;induced charge transfer pathway in a supramolecular photocatalyst comprising of an ionic covalent organic framework (COF) and cationic metal complexes. The dynamic electrostatic interactions not only attract cations around the COF to accept photogenerated electrons, but also allow for a retention of homogeneous catalytic characters of complexes, making a subtle balance. Accordingly, the electrostatic confinement effect facilitates the forward electron transfer from a photoexcited COF to cationic Co complex, realizing a remarkable photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance. Its catalytic efficiency is far superior to the supramolecular counterparts with Van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals or hydrogen bonding interactions. This work presents an insight for enhancing charge transfer in supramolecular systems, and provides an effective approach for construction of highly efficient photocatalysts.

         <title>Facilitating Rapid OH&#8722;/H2O Transport in Anion Exchange Membranes via Ultra&#8208;Stable Heteroatom&#8208;Free Micropores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transport channels constructed by rigid, twisted heteroatom&#8208;free micropores (HFMs) in anion exchange membranes (AEMs) significantly reduce ionic transport resistance, achieving high self&#8208;diffusion coefficient and OH&#8722;conductivity. The carbon&#8208;carbon bonds within HFMs also provide exceptional stability in 1&#8197;M KOH at 80&#8201;&#176;C. Consequently, HFM&#8208;AEMs based water electrolysis demonstrate exceptional performance, maintaining durability over 3000&#8197;hours.







Abstract
Efficient OH&#8722; conduction in anion exchange membranes (AEMs) is pivotal for the advancement and industrialization of sustainable electrochemical technologies in alkaline environments, including water electrolysis, fuel cells, and CO2 electroreduction. We here designed AEMs with a novel class of rigid heteroatom&#8208;free micropores (HFMs), engineered at the molecular level to facilitate rapid ionic transport in an ultra&#8208;stable manner. By manipulating monomers, our design strategically controls the torsional angles and energy barriers within the polymeric backbones, creating sub&#8208;nanometer ionic channels that precisely regulate porosity. These hydrophilic micropores significantly enhance the mobility of OH&#8722;/H2O, achieving over a 150&#8201;% increase in self&#8208;diffusion coefficient compared to commercial AEMs and elevating OH&#8722; conductivity to a leading 215&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, the robust carbon&#8208;carbon bond construction in HFMs offers the stability that is four orders of magnitude higher under severe alkaline conditions compared to existing wisdoms, with a demonstrated operational lifespan of over 4000&#8197;hours. The integration of HFM&#8208;AEMs into water electrolyzers not only supports the use of platinum group metal&#8208;free catalysts but also exhibits exceptional energy efficiency and extended durability, highlighting their substantial potential for wide&#8208;ranging applications in emerging electrochemical technologies.

         <title>Regulating Interfacial Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Networks by Implanting Cu Sites with Perfluorooctane to Accelerate CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) to ethanol holds promise to generate value&#8208;added chemicals and harness renewable energy simultaneously, though challenging. The authors presented an interesting CO2RR selectivity switch from ethylene to ethanol by implanting Cu2O catalyst with C8F18 to regulate the hydrogen bonding networks, achieving FEethanol of &#8764;55.2&#8201;% and the ethanol&#8208;to&#8208;ethylene ratio of ~5.4.







Abstract
Efficient CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) to ethanol holds promise to generate value&#8208;added chemicals and harness renewable energy simultaneously. Yet, it remains an ongoing challenge due to the competition with thermodynamically more preferred ethylene production. Herein, we presented a CO2 reduction predilection switch from ethylene to ethanol (ethanol&#8208;to&#8208;ethylene ratio of ~5.4) by inherently implanting Cu sites with perfluorooctane to create interfacial noncovalent interactions. The 1.83&#8201;%F&#8208;Cu2O organic&#8211;inorganic hybrids (OIHs) exhibited an extraordinary ethanol faradaic efficiency (FEethanol) of &#8764;55.2&#8201;%, with an impressive ethanol partial current density of 166&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and excellent robustness over 60&#8197;hours of continuous operation. This exceptional performance ranks our 1.83&#8201;%F&#8208;Cu2O OIHs among the best&#8208;performing ethanol&#8208;oriented CO2RR electrocatalysts. Our findings identified that C8F18 could strengthen the interfacial hydrogen bonding connectivity, which consequently promotes the generation of active hydrogen species and preferentially favors the hydrogenation of *CHCOH to *CHCHOH, thus switching the reaction from ethylene&#8208;preferred to ethanol&#8208;oriented. The presented investigations highlight opportunities for using noncovalent interactions to tune the selectivity of CO2 electroreduction to ethanol, bringing it closer to practical implementation requirements.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Tin Halide Perovskite Films with High Structural Integrity for Near&#8208;Infrared Imaging Array Enabling Hidden Object Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We provided a simple spin&#8208;coating technique for the preparation of quasi&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (QSC) CH(NH2)2SnI3 (FASnI3) perovskite films with high structural integrity and effective near&#8208;infrared (NIR) response. Through a series of in&#8197;situ characterizations, we reveal that the orderly growth mode of QSC&#8208;FASnI3 perovskite films enables high structural integrity with more oriented crystal, reduced trap and grain boundaries. Consequently, self&#8208;powered NIR photodetector based on QSC&#8208;FASnI3 films exhibited remarkable optoelectrical properties, including low dark current density of 1.9&#215;10&#8722;10&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, fast response time of 1.06&#8197;&#956;s, high responsivity value of 0.43&#8197;A&#8201;W&#8722;1, large detectivity over 1013 Jones in the NIR range (780&#8211;890&#8197;nm), and an ultralow noise current of 1.68&#215;10&#8722;14&#8197;A&#8201;Hz&#8722;1/2, which were among the best NIR perovskite photodetectors. Ultimately, the high&#8208;resolution 64&#215;64 (4096) pixels NIR imaging array was fabricated on the thin film transistor backplanes, enabling ultraweak NIR light (63&#8197;nW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) real&#8208;time imaging, fingerprint imaging, and hidden object recognition.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) image sensors based on solution&#8208;processed thin film are gaining prominence in various applications, including security detection, remote sensing, medical imaging, and environmental monitoring, owing to superior penetration capabilities of NIR light. However, the reported perovskite image sensors suffer from limited resolution and performance due to poor structural integrity, bioincompatibility, and constrained response wavelength range from lead&#8208;based perovskite materials employed. In this study, we present non&#8208;toxic quasi&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (QSC) CH(NH2)2SnI3 (FASnI3) perovskite films, prepared via a simple spin&#8208;coating technique, that demonstrate high structural integrity and effective NIR response. Through a series of in&#8197;situ characterizations, we reveal that the orderly growth mode of QSC&#8208;FASnI3 perovskite films enables a more oriented crystal growth with reduced trap and grain boundaries. Consequently, self&#8208;powered NIR photodetector based on QSC&#8208;FASnI3 films exhibited large detectivity over 1013 Jones in the NIR range (780&#8211;890&#8197;nm). Ultimately, due to the high structural integrity, the high&#8208;resolution 64&#215;64 (4096) pixels NIR imaging array, exhibiting reduced photo and dark response non&#8208;uniformity value, was fabricated on the thin&#8208;film transistors (TFT) backplanes, enabling ultraweak NIR light (63&#8197;nW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) real&#8208;time imaging, fingerprint imaging, and hidden object recognition. This work pioneers the application of lead&#8208;free perovskite for high&#8208;resolution NIR imaging arrays.

Through a series of in&#8197;situ characterizations, we reveal that the orderly growth mode of QSC-FASnI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite films enables high structural integrity with more oriented crystal, reduced trap and grain boundaries. Consequently, self-powered NIR photodetector based on QSC-FASnI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; films exhibited remarkable optoelectrical properties, including low dark current density of 1.9&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;10&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, fast response time of 1.06&#8197;&#956;s, high responsivity value of 0.43&#8197;A&#8201;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, large detectivity over 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Jones in the NIR range (780&#8211;890&#8197;nm), and an ultralow noise current of 1.68&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;14&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;A&#8201;Hz&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;, which were among the best NIR perovskite photodetectors. Ultimately, the high-resolution 64&#215;64 (4096) pixels NIR imaging array was fabricated on the thin film transistor backplanes, enabling ultraweak NIR light (63&#8197;nW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) real-time imaging, fingerprint imaging, and hidden object recognition.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near-infrared (NIR) image sensors based on solution-processed thin film are gaining prominence in various applications, including security detection, remote sensing, medical imaging, and environmental monitoring, owing to superior penetration capabilities of NIR light. However, the reported perovskite image sensors suffer from limited resolution and performance due to poor structural integrity, bioincompatibility, and constrained response wavelength range from lead-based perovskite materials employed. In this study, we present non-toxic quasi-single-crystal (QSC) CH(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SnI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (FASnI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) perovskite films, prepared via a simple spin-coating technique, that demonstrate high structural integrity and effective NIR response. Through a series of in&#8197;situ characterizations, we reveal that the orderly growth mode of QSC-FASnI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite films enables a more oriented crystal growth with reduced trap and grain boundaries. Consequently, self-powered NIR photodetector based on QSC-FASnI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; films exhibited large detectivity over 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Jones in the NIR range (780&#8211;890&#8197;nm). Ultimately, due to the high structural integrity, the high-resolution 64&#215;64 (4096) pixels NIR imaging array, exhibiting reduced photo and dark response non-uniformity value, was fabricated on the thin-film transistors (TFT) backplanes, enabling ultraweak NIR light (63&#8197;nW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) real-time imaging, fingerprint imaging, and hidden object recognition. This work pioneers the application of lead-free perovskite for high-resolution NIR imaging arrays.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Global Profiling Lysine Reactivity and Ligandability with Oxidant&#8208;Triggered Bioconjugation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxidant&#8208;induced bioconjugation method has been developed for studying small molecule&#8208;lysine interactions. Various advantages have been demonstrated including real&#8208;time controllable labeling, excellent amino acid selectivity and labeling efficiency, in&#8208;depth lysine profiling capability and high stability. A suite of new ligandable lysines have been characterized, thus offering insights for exploring new functional and targetable residues.







Abstract
Due to the high abundance and diverse functions of lysine residues, both in the interior and on the surface of proteins, the development of new methods to characterize their reactivity and ligandability could significantly expand the pool of druggable targets. To date, only a limited number of aminophilic electrophiles have been assessed for interactions with the lysine proteome, resulting in a substantial fraction remaining inaccessible to current probes. Here, to the best of our knowledge, we report the first oxidant&#8208;triggered bioconjugation platform for in&#8208;depth profiling of lysines. We quantified over 7000&#8197;covalently modifiable lysine residues, which significantly expands the coverage of ligandable lysines in the whole proteome. Chemical proteomics enabled the mapping of more than 100&#8197;endogenous kinases, thus providing a comprehensive landscape of ligandable catalytic lysines within the kinome. Moreover, we identified a suite of new ligandable lysines such as K60 of ENO1 and K31 of PPIA, offering insights for exploring new functional and targetable residues. These findings could provide valuable clues for the development of targeted covalent inhibitors (TCIs).

This work presents the controlled ROP of MVL using a simple organoaluminum complex [MeAl(BHT)2] (BHT=2,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenoxy) to produce functionalizable P(MVL)ROP at room temperature. P(MVL)ROP with a high molar mass behaves as a tough thermoplastic with good mechanical properties comparable to isotactic PP. Moreover, MeAl(BHT)2 can also efficiently catalyzed the bulk depolymerization of P(MVL)ROP to recover MVL.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Methylene&#8208;&#948;&#8208;valerolactone (MVL) as a bio&#8208;renewable bifunctional monomer has shown great promise to prepare closed&#8208;loop recyclable polyester with pendent functionalizable double bond. However, the chemoselective ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of MVL still faces challenges including low polymerization temperature, expensive catalyst as well as high catalyst loading. In this contribution, we present the chemoselective and controlled ROP of MVL using a simple organoaluminum complex [MeAl(BHT)2] (BHT=2,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenoxy), which can be easily prepared from commercially available trimethylaluminum and 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenol without purification. MeAl(BHT)2 exhibits much higher catalytic activity (TOF=668&#8201;h&#8722;1) than that of MeAl[Salen] (TOF=89&#8197;h&#8722;1), a commonly used organoaluminum catalyst. The high chemoselectivity and activity of MeAl(BHT)2 is proposed to originate from the cooperative activation of propagating chain&#8208;ends and monomers via the &#8220;coordination&#8208;insertion&#8221; mechanism. Remarkably, high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight P(MVL)ROP can be prepared in bulk using MeAl(BHT)2, which is not accessible by the previous catalysts. This study may advance the development of closed&#8208;loop recyclable polymers considering the easy preparation, low cost and good catalytic performance of MeAl(BHT)2.

         <title>Borane&#8208;Mediated Highly Secondary Selective Deoxyfluorination of Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Borane&#8208;mediated deoxyfluorination of in situ generated N&#8208;H&#8208;O&#8208;alkyl&#8208;isoureas using Et3N&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3HF represents a novel approach to achieve a highly 2&#176;&#8208;alcohol&#8208;selective substitution in preference to benzylic, 1&#176; and 3&#176; alcohol deoxyfluorination. The key to the 2&#176; selectivity is the relative stability of the N&#8208;BBN&#8208;O&#8208;alkyl&#8208;isoureas towards elimination of the carbodiimide.







Abstract
Organofluorine compounds are vital across multiple sectors, hence highly selective methods to install fluorine are of considerable importance. The deoxyfluorination of alcohols is a key approach to prepare organofluorine compounds, however, a highly secondary (2&#176;)&#8208;selective deoxyfluorination of alcohols has not been realized to date. Herein, we report that borane&#8208;mediated deoxyfluorination results in high 2&#176;&#8208;selectivity in inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;molecular competition reactions versus primary (1&#176;), tertiary (3&#176;) and even benzylic (Bn) alcohols. This is an operationally simple method using only commercial reagents (e.g., Et3N&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3HF) that starts from the alcohol which is converted to the O&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N&#8208;H&#8208;isourea in situ. The origin of the high 2&#176;&#8208;selectivity was elucidated to be due to the relative barriers to carbodiimide elimination from the O&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N&#8208;(BR2)&#8208;isoureas. As the selectivity controlling step does not involve fluoride, this borane&#8208;mediated approach can be applied to other nucleophiles, as demonstrated by 2&#176;&#8208;selective deoxychlorination using HCl occurring in preference to substitution of 1&#176; and Bn analogues. This borane&#8208;mediated nucleophilic substitution therefore provides a new approach to circumvent the selectivity limitations inherent in classical SN2 and SN1 type reactions.

The strong coupling effect of p&#8208;n CS&#8208;BWO heterojunction induced the formation of a robust interface electric field, leading to the efficient charge separation for preferential CO2 photoreduction into CO.







Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction serves as an important technology for value&#8208;added solar fuel production, however, it is generally limited by interfacial charge transport. To address this limitation, a two&#8208;dimensional/two&#8208;dimensional (2D/2D) p&#8208;n heterojunction CuS&#8208;Bi2WO6 (CS&#8208;BWO) with highly connected and matched interfacial lattices was designed in this work via a two&#8208;step hydrothermal tandem synthesis strategy. The integration of CuS with BWO created a robust interface electric field and provided fast charge transfer channels due to the work function difference, as well as highly connected and matched interfacial lattices. The p&#8208;n heterojunction combination promoted the electron transfer from the Cu to Bi sites, leading to the coordination of Bi sites with high electronic density and low oxidation state. The Bi sites in the BWO nanosheets facilitated the adsorption and activation of CO2, and the generation of high&#8208;coverage key intermediate b&#8208;CO32&#8722;, while CuS (CS) acted as a broad light&#8208;harvesting material to provide abundant photoinduced electrons that were injected into the conduction band of BWO for CO2 photoreduction reaction. Remarkably, the p&#8208;n heterojunction CS&#8208;BWO exhibited average CO and CH4 yields of 33.9 and 16.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, respectively, which were significantly higher than those of CS, BWO, and physical mixture CS&#8208;BWO samples. This work provided an innovative design strategy for developing high&#8208;activity heterojunction photocatalyst for converting CO2 into value&#8208;added solar fuels.

         <title>Facile Access to Phosphorus Ylide&#8208;fused Heteroarenes Possessing Tunable Optoelectronic Properties and High Nonlinear Optical Performances</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>

A one&#8208;pot facile [2+3]/[3+3] phospha&#8208;annulation synthetic method has led to a class of novel phosphorus ylide&#8208;fused dipolar polycyclic P&#8208;heteroarenes. These P&#8208;heteroarenes not only show tunable optical and redox properties, they also show high stability for further modification.







Abstract
We report here a novel family of ylidic P&#8208;heteroarenes (P1&#8211;P6), structurally featuring unique phosphonium cyclopentadienylide (P&#8722;Cp)&#8208;fused &#960;&#8208;skeletons and synthetically prepared via an unexpected one&#8208;pot [2+3]/[3+3] phospha&#8208;annulation reaction. While the facile and modular synthesis allows the fine&#8208;tuning of their optical absorptions and redox properties, single&#8208;crystallographic and theoretical analysis of these P&#8208;heteroarenes further reveal that the fusion of P&#8722;Cp moiety leads to substantial intramolecular charge&#8208;separated features with high ylidic character values of up to 84&#8201;%. Benefitted from such dipolar structures, these P&#8208;heteroarenes not only allows stepwise electrophilic substitution reaction for further structural &#960;&#8208;expansions, but also exhibit excellent nonlinear optical (NLO) responses and optical limiting (OL) performances comparable to or exceed those of C60. As a model compound, the persistent radical&#8208;anion salt of P5a was also prepared through chemical reduction, thus offering valuable insights into the electronic structures of reduced P&#8208;ylidic species. Our work not only established a highly efficient synthetic method toward new P&#8208;heteroarenes, but also provide fundamental understanding of those fused&#8208;ring ylidic P&#8208;heterocycles with promising NLO/OL applications.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;rapid Synthesis of High&#8208;entropy MAX Phases and Their Derivative MXenes for Battery Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized high&#8208;entropy MAX phases within 15 minutes, including a new phase (Ti0.2V0.2Cr0.2Nb0.2Mo0.2)4AlC3 and three 413&#8208;type phases. The varied stacking modes among MX slabs in high&#8208;entropy MAX phases and the distinct topological transformations to their derivative MXenes were observed. TiVNbMoC3 electrode demonstrates superior lithium&#8208;ion storage capabilities with 725&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, triggering the edification to the application of high&#8208;entropy MXenes for energy domain.







Abstract
High&#8208;entropy materials hold immense promise for energy storage, owing to their varied compositions and unforeseen physicochemical properties, yet, which poses challenges in synthesis due to tendentious phase separation and extended sintering durations. Herein, an ultra&#8208;rapid strategy based on spark plasma sintering (SPS) techniques is proposed to synthesize high&#8208;entropy MAX phases within 15&#8197;minutes, including a new phase of (Ti0.2V0.2Cr0.2Nb0.2Mo0.2)4AlC3 and several phases of 413&#8208;type TiVNbMoAlC3, TiVCrMoAlC3 and (Ti0.2V0.2Cr0.2Nb0.2Ta0.2)4AlC3, achieving utmost purity level up to 99.54&#8201;%. Under high temperature, the overfeed of Al with low melt point (~660&#8201;&#176;C) can foster a liquid environment, which remits the immiscibility among starting materials and benefits to diffusion dynamics to some extents. Theoretical calculations are employed to elucidate the thermodynamic preponderance of high&#8208;entropy MAX phases in the intricate multi&#8208;element systems. Meanwhile, the varied stacking modes among MX slabs in high&#8208;entropy MAX phases and the distinct topological transformations to their derivative MXenes can be observed directly at the atomic level. Moreover, four high&#8208;entropy MXenes as electrode materials were investigated for rechargeable batteries. Among them, TiVNbMoC3 electrode demonstrates superior lithium&#8208;ion storage capabilities with 725&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;A g&#8722;1, triggering the edification to the application of high&#8208;entropy MXenes for energy domain.

         <title>The Hidden Mechanism: Excited&#8208;State Proton&#8208;Electron Pair Transfer in Metal Nanocluster Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we explored the role of concerted electron&#8208;proton transfer (CEPT) in the luminescence of metal nanoclusters (NCs). CEPT can harness all available reaction energy and serves as a key limiting factor for the emission of metal NCs at physiological pH. Our findings also provide new insights into the pH&#8208;dependent luminescence of metal NCs, as the CEPT dynamics are closely correlated with the increase in transition state energy as pH decreases.







Abstract
Comprehending the underlying factors that govern photoluminescence (PL) in metal nanoclusters (NCs) under physiological conditions remains a highly intriguing and unresolved challenge, particularly for their biomedical applications. In this study, we evaluate the critical role of excited&#8208;state proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer in the emission of metal NCs. Our findings demonstrate that hydronium ion (H3O+) binding can trigger a nonlinear, pH&#8208;dependent excited&#8208;state concerted electron proton transfer (CEPT) reaction. This involves simultaneous electron transfer from the Au(0) core to the Au(I)&#8722;ATT (ATT denotes 6&#8208;aza&#8208;2&#8208;thiothymidine) surface and proton transfer from H3O+ to the ATT ligand in a single step, greatly promoting vibrations and rotations of the Au(I)&#8722;ATT surface, resulting in substantial PL quenching of Au10(ATT)6 NCs. Further analyses show that the unique CEPT dynamics are strongly influenced by the opposing effects of increased reorganization energy and a larger pre&#8208;exponential factor on the electron transfer rate. Moreover, the proposed excited&#8208;state CEPT process is found to be prevalent in core&#8211;shell relaxation metal NCs, such as Au25(SR)18 (SR denotes thiolate) NCs, and serves as an important factor in limiting their PL emission. By simply controlling the pKa of the ligands, the emission performance of Au25(SR)18 can be easily regulated in physiological environments.

         <title>Enhanced UV Light Responsivity in &lt;110&gt;&#8208;Oriented 2D Perovskites Realized by Pressure&#8208;Induced Ultrafast Exciton Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our study shows a remarkable transition in PL from STEs to FEs and significant enhancement in exciton mobility of 93.6&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, reaching levels comparable to those in 3D perovskites. Additionally, the evaluation of FE diffusion coefficients under different pressures revealed anisotropic exciton diffusion within the inorganic plane, with an anisotropy ratio of 4.97. This value is the highest reported so far in these &#8208;oriented 2D perovskites, due to a decrease in electron&#8208;phonon coupling and exciton reduced mass. Characterized by its notably high FE diffusion coefficient, it exhibits an excellent UV light sensitivity at ~2.8&#8197;GPa, highlighting their potential applications in creating high&#8208;efficiency optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) &lt;100&gt;&#8208;oriented perovskites exhibit superior optoelectronic properties, offering significant potential in photovoltaic, light&#8208;emitting, and photodetection applications. Nevertheless, their enlarged interlayer spacing restricts longitudinal carrier transport, thereby limiting its potential applications. While &lt;110&gt;&#8208;oriented 2D perovskites provide a prospective solution with their compact interlayer spacing, their inherent structure, characterized by octahedra tilting, indirectly hinders carrier transport due to the generation of self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) caused by strong electron&#8208;phonon coupling. Here, we adeptly regulate the photoluminescence (PL) from STEs to free excitons (FEs) emission within the 2D &lt;110&gt;&#8208;oriented (API)PbBr4 single crystal through structure optimization under pressure treatment. Besides, we observed anisotropic FE transport with an anisotropy ratio of 4.97. The exciton mobility reaches a peak of 93.6&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 at 2.7&#8197;GPa, a value comparable to those of their three&#8208;dimensional (3D) counterparts, which is attributed to a reduction in electron&#8208;phonon coupling and exciton reduced mass. Additionally, this ultrafast exciton transport significantly enhances UV light responsivity, exhibiting an increase of approximately 5000 times at 2.7&#8197;GPa in comparison to ambient conditions. These findings highlight the prospective application of 2D &lt;110&gt;&#8208;oriented perovskites in high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices through intrinsic structural modulation.

         <title>The Effect of Electric Fields on Oxidization Processes at the Air&#8208;Water Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Some difficult chemical reactions occur spontaneously in water microdroplets, and electric fields at the air&#8211;water interface are thought to be the main cause. Using theoretical computations for two prototypical processes involving OH&#8722; we show that the magnitude of the electric fields required to make the processes favorable are much higher than those existing at the pristine air&#8211;water interface. We discuss the implications of the results.







Abstract
At the air&#8211;water interface, many reactions are accelerated, sometimes by several orders of magnitude. This phenomenon has proved to be particularly important in water microdroplets, where the spontaneous oxidation of many species stable in bulk has been experimentally demonstrated. Different theories have been proposed to explain this finding, but it is currently believed that the role of interfacial electric fields is key. In this work, we have carried out a quantum chemistry study aimed at shedding some light on this question. We have studied two prototypical processes in which a hydroxide anion transfers its excess electron to either the water environment or a dioxygen molecule. To model the interface, we use a cluster of 21 water molecules immersed in an electric field, and we examine the energetics of the studied reactions as a function of field magnitude. Our results reveal that electric fields close to those estimated for the neat air&#8211;water interface (&#8764;0.15&#8197;V&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#197;&#8722;1) have a moderate effect on the reaction energetics and that much stronger fields (&gt;1&#8197;V&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#197;&#8722;1) are required to get spontaneous electron transfer. Therefore, the study suggests that additional factors such as an excess charge in microdroplets need to be considered for explaining the experimental observations.

         <title>Halting Oxygen Evolution to Achieve Long Cycle Life in Sodium Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;voltage oxygen redox chemistries show promise for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathodes but are hindered by oxygen instability and structural degradation. We propose an entropy&#8208;enforced strategy to induce electronic structure disorder (ESD) at high desodiation, impeding oxygen mobility and suppressing structural changes. The high&#8208;entropy state induced by cationic disordering also perturbs cationic redox boundaries, constraining the phase distortion.







Abstract
Oxygen redox chemistries at high voltage have materialized as a revolutionary paradigm for cathodes with high&#8208;energy density; however, they are plagued by the challenges of labile oxygen loss and rapid degradations upon cycling, even after concerted endeavors from the research community. Here we propose a multi&#8208;concentration stratagem propelled by entropy reinforcement to enhance the electronic structure disorder (ESD) at high desodiation states for impeding undesired oxygen mobility and ensuring controlled oxygen activity, elucidated by density functional theory calculations. The increased disorder strengthens the reversible electrochemistry of lattice oxygen redox, leading to effectively suppressed P&#8722;O structural evolution and highly stable localized TMO6 octahedral environments, as demonstrated by soft/hard X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. Furthermore, through a comparative analysis of sodium&#8208;layered cathodes with different configuration entropy, we reveal that a high&#8208;entropy state induced by cationic disordering has the capacity to perturb cationic redox boundaries, significantly restraining the formation of detrimental O&#8242;3 phases. As a consequence, the high&#8208;voltage cycling stability has been greatly upgraded, up to 4.4&#8197;V versus Na+/Na, with an impressive 90.1&#8201;% capacity retention at 1&#8197;C over 100 cycles and 76.1&#8201;% capacity retention at 2&#8197;C over 300 cycles. The resilient oxygen redox, enabled through the control of ESD, broadens the horizons for entropy engineering and lays the foundation for advancements in high&#8208;energy, long&#8208;cycling, and safe batteries.

         <title>Controllable Heavy n&#8211;type Behaviours in Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with Non&#8208;Conjugated Passivants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed heavy n&#8208;type doped perovskite by precisely controlling the electron&#8208;deficient ability of piperazinium iodide derivatives. The CCPI&#8208;treated PSCs exhibited a champion efficiency of 25.74&#8201;% and maintained 88&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 1,200&#8197;hours at 85&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Interfacial issues between the perovskite film and electron transport layer greatly limit the efficiency and stability of inverted (p&#8208;i&#8208;n) perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Despite organic ammonium passivants have been widely established as interfacial layers, they failed to improve electron extraction. Here, we reported that the heavy n&#8208;type characteristics in a low band gap perovskite film could be modulated by incorporating non&#8208;conjugated ammonium passivants with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing abilities. This resulted in a significant enhancement of electron extraction in the heavily n&#8208;type doped perovskite. The passivant&#8208;treated PSCs exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 25.74&#8201;% with an excellent fill factor of 85.4&#8201;% and a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.166&#8197;V, which are significantly higher than that of the control device. The unencapsulated devices maintained 88&#8201;% of their initial PCEs after 1,200&#8197;hours at 85&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Complementary Reducing Agents are Responsible for Temporally Distinct Nucleation and Growth Phases During the Polyol Synthesis of Ag Nanocubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) end&#8208;groups are shown to initiate nucleation in the polyol synthesis of silver nanocubes. The rate of nucleation (k1) is smaller than digestion by O2/Cl&#8722; (k&#8208;1) until air is removed, but larger than growth of the cubes (k2), which is critical for maintaining shape control. Nuclei number density is controlled only by PVP end&#8208;group concentration, independent of Ag+ concentration. Selectivity to cubes requires a narrow window of particle number density due to the autocatalytic growth mechanism.







Abstract
Ethylene glycol or one of its oxidation products are believed to serve as reducing agents in the shape&#8208;controlled synthesis of Ag nanocubes (NCs) by the polyol process. The identity of end&#8208;groups of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) impacts shape control with alcohol and aldehyde moieties serving as a primary Ag reducing agent. We explored the role of PVP end&#8208;groups in the polyol process by measuring the dependence of particle number density of Ag NCs produced on the initial concentration(s) of Ag and PVP using small angle x&#8208;ray scattering and statistically large particle size distributions analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. The number density of Ag NCs is strongly dependent on the starting concentration of PVP chains demonstrating PVP end&#8208;groups play an important role in the nucleation of NCs. The concentration of Ag+ is 2 orders of magnitude higher than the end&#8208;groups suggesting ethylene glycol must participate in the reduction of Ag+ during growth. Perturbation experiments and analysis of resultant particle size distribution reveal nucleation is fast relative to growth of NCs, reinforcing the synergy between PVP end&#8208;groups and ethylene glycol. The evidence demonstrates PVP end&#8208;groups and ethylene glycol are tandem reducing agents operative in temporally distinct phases of the polyol synthesis of Ag NCs.

         <title>Rapid Surface Reconstruction of Amorphous&#8208;Crystalline NiO for Industrial&#8208;Scale Electrocatalytic PET Upcycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiO with an amorphous&#8208;crystalline structure synthesized through ultra&#8208;low&#8208;temperature oxidation exhibits rapid reconstruction and enhanced active sites, which can reach an industrial current density of &gt;1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and generate a profit of $582 per ton of waste PET.







Abstract
The conversion of plastic waste into valuable chemicals through innovative and selective nano&#8208;catalysts offers significant economic benefits and positive environmental impacts. However, our current understanding of catalyst design capable of achieving industrial&#8208;grade current densities is limited. Herein, we develop a self&#8208;supported amorphous&#8208;crystalline NiO electrocatalyst for the electrocatalytic upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into formate and hydrogen fuel. The catalyst achieves an industrial current density of over 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.5&#8197;V vs. RHE, with an 80&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency and a formate production rate of 7.16&#8197;mmol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1. In situ Raman spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations reveal that the rapid transformation of amorphous&#8208;crystalline NiO into &#947;&#8208;NiOOH at the amorphous&#8208;crystalline interface provides a thermodynamic advantage for formate desorption, leading to the high activity required for industrial applications, which is challenging to achieve for fully crystalline NiO. A techno&#8208;economic analysis indicates that recycling waste PET using this catalytic process could generate a profit of $582 per ton. This work presents a cost&#8208;effective and highly efficient approach to promoting the sustainable utilization of waste PET.

         <title>A Highly Active Molybdenum Carbide Catalyst with Dynamic Carbon Flux for Reverse Water&#8208;Gas Shift Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional understanding suggests that the catalytic mechanism is predominantly governed by surface phenomena. This study reveals that bulk carbon in &#945;&#8208;MoC also participates via exchange with surface carbon. Isotopic analysis shows carbon exchange increases with temperature, maintaining &#945;&#8208;MoC stability and high reactivity.







Abstract
Molybdenum carbide has been reported as an efficient and stable catalyst for reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction. The conventional understanding of the mechanism suggests domination of the surface phenomena, with only surface or subsurface layers partaking in the catalytic cycle. In this study, we presented a highly active MoC catalyst from carburization process, which showed a mass&#8208;specific reaction rate over 260&#8197;&#956;m

 with dynamic carbon flux in the bulk phase of the catalyst. Through Isotopic Temperature&#8208;Programmed Reaction (ITPR) analysis and Environmental Transmission Electron Microscopy (ETEM), we discerned dynamic carbon flow circulating between the &#945;&#8208;MoC bulk phase and the gas phase reactants under the RWGS reaction atmosphere. This circulation, essential to maintaining the structural stability of the metastable &#945;&#8208;MoC and its ultra&#8208;high reactivity, is accompanied by thorough carbon component exchange among the bulk, the surface and the gas&#8208;phase reactants during the reaction process.

         <title>Energy Transfer (EnT) Catalysis of Non&#8208;Symmetrical Borylated Dienes: Origin of Reaction Selectivity in Competing EnT Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energy transfer (EnT) has emerged as the gold standard for the excitation of unsaturated bonds. However, control over competing reaction pathways remains an intractable challenge. Here boron is used to probe the reactivity of non&#8208;symmetrical dienes under EnT, enabling a site&#8208; and regioselective [2+2] cycloaddition. Counterintuitive regiodivergence was observed when probing geometric isomerisation, leading to a mechanistic investigation to determine the origin of selectivity in competing EnT processes.







Abstract
Energy transfer catalysis (EnT) has had a profound impact on contemporary organic synthesis enabling the construction of higher in energy, complex molecules, via efficient access to the triplet excited state. Despite this, intermolecular reactivity, and the unique possibility to access several reaction pathways via a central triplet diradical has rendered control over reaction outcomes, an intractable challenge. Extended chromophores such as non&#8208;symmetrical dienes have the potential to undergo [2+2] cycloaddition, [4+2] cycloaddition or geometric isomerisation, which, in combination with other mechanistic considerations (site&#8208; and regioselectivity), results in chemical reactions that are challenging to regulate. Herein, we utilise boron as a tool to probe reactivity of non&#8208;symmetrical dienes under EnT catalysis, paying particular attention to the impact of boron hybridisation effects on the target reactivity. Through this, a highly site&#8208; and regioselective [2+2] cycloaddition was realised with the employed boron motif effecting reaction efficiency. Subtle modifications to the core scaffold enabled a [4+2] cycloaddition, while a counterintuitive regiodivergence was observed in geometric isomerisation versus [2+2] cycloaddition. The observed reactivity was validated via a mechanistic investigation, determining the origin of regiodivergence and reaction selectivity in competing EnT processes.

         <title>Transition Metal as Template: Reversing the Synthesis Logic in the Preparation of Pincer Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a new approach to the synthesis of PEP (E=B, Al, Si, P) pincer complexes of transition metals wherein the introduction of the phosphine&#8208;containing fragments into the metal coordination sphere precedes the introduction of the main group element linchpin. This &#8220;reverse&#8221; synthesis logic broadens and simplifies access to pincer complexes because it obviates the need to prepare and isolate a propincer precursor molecule containing both the central main group element and the phosphine donors.







Abstract
The conventional synthetic approach to transition metal pincer complexes calls for the preparation of the tridentate pincer (pro)ligand first, with subsequent introduction of the transition metal center as the last step. This work demonstrates that the alternative synthetic logic, where the central main group element is introduced last, can be applicable to a number of PEP pincer complexes (E=B, Al, Si, P) derived from phosphinophenols and phosphinopyrroles. This approach obviates the need to isolate well&#8208;behaved propincer precursors, and instead relies on the formation of phosphine&#8208;metal adducts first, whose nature determines the stoichiometry of the needed main group reagent to complete the synthesis.

         <title>Selenium Dioxide Catalyzed Polymerization of N&#8208;doped Poly(benzodifurandione) (n&#8208;PBDF) and Its Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a discovery in the scalable and cost&#8208;effective synthesis of n&#8208;doped poly(benzodifurandione) (n&#8208;PBDF) using selenium dioxide (SeO2) as a catalyst. The method achieves high monomer conversion and eliminates the need for expensive and time&#8208;consuming purification processes like dialysis, making it more suitable for large&#8208;scale production. The discovery not only addresses the limitations of previous methods but also introduces a new polymerization pathway involving SeO2 catalysis. This paves the way for the broader application of n&#8208;PBDF and its derivatives in electronics and related fields.







Abstract
The recent discovery of highly conductive, solution&#8208;processable, n&#8208;doped poly(benzodifurandione) (n&#8208;PBDF) marks a milestone in the development of conducting polymers. Currently, n&#8208;PBDF is prepared by either duroquinone&#8208;mediated or copper&#8208;catalyzed polymerizations, where scalability and cost&#8208;effectiveness may present challenges. Here, we report a general, scalable, and cost&#8208;effective method for n&#8208;PBDF and its derivatives, namely selenium dioxide (SeO2) catalyzed polymerization. We discovered that a catalytic amount of selenium dioxide leads to high monomer conversions (&gt;99&#8201;% by NMR). The obtained n&#8208;PBDF exhibits a consistently narrow hydrodynamic diameter distribution and its thin films show high conductivities. Furthermore, we revealed that this polymerization involves a mechanism distinct from the previously reported radical pathway. It involves successive Riley oxidation and aldol polycondensation processes. It was also found that the reduced selenium precipitates from dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) when the catalytic cycle is terminated, allowing for a straightforward purification process through centrifugation and filtration. This method thus eliminates the need for the costly and slow dialysis process. Finally, we demonstrated that SeO2 catalyzed polymerization is applicable to n&#8208;PBDF derivatives, proving the generality of this method.

         <title>Multidentate Chelating Ligands Enable High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Bromine Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ethylenediamine tetramethylene phosphonic acid (EDTMPA) strongly adsorbs onto the zinc surface, facilitating the formation of dynamically regulated impoverished water interfaces at the inner Helmholtz plane and optimizing the nucleation of Zn2+. Additionally, EDTMPA also shows the ability to alter the solvation structure of Zn2+ by displacing the coordinated H2O molecules within the primary Zn2+ solvation shell. These properties enable EDTMPA to suppress side reactions, such as hydrogen evolution reaction and &#8220;dead zinc&#8221; (Zn5(OH)8Cl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O) generation, and improve zinc deposition to prevent dendrite formation.







Abstract
Zinc bromine flow battery (ZBFB) is a promising battery technology for stationary energy storage. However, challenges specific to zinc anodes must be resolved, including zinc dendritic growth, hydrogen evolution reaction, and the occurrence of &#8220;dead zinc&#8221;. Traditional additives suppress side reactions and zinc dendrite formation by altering the solvation structure of Zn2+ and adsorbing onto the zinc surface through only a limited number of zincophilic sites, resulting in weak adsorption on zinc metal and potential inability to simultaneously optimize the solvation structure of zinc ions. Obviously, increasing the number of potential zincophilic sites in the additive can significantly enhance the interaction with zinc. Herein, we propose a strong chelate, ethylenediamine tetramethylene phosphonic acid (EDTMPA) as the additive, which boasts six potent zincophilic sites, not only promotes the formation of the water&#8208;deficient inner Helmholtz plane but also plays a crucial role in restructuring the solvation environment of Zn2+. As a result, the zinc symmetric flow battery with EDTMPA exhibited exceptional coulombic efficiency of 99.4&#8201;% over 800 cycles, surpassing the previous studies by a significant margin. Furthermore, the assembled ZBFB has showcased a dendrite&#8208;free and enduring cycling over 400 cycles at 80&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Mild&#8208;Condition Photocatalytic Reforming of Methanol&#8208;Water by a Hierarchical, Asymmetry Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical asymmetry porous carbon nitride was synthesized by supramolecular subassembly strategy. Abundant defects and structure distortions of MetCNx expedite the separation of photogenerated charges. The suitable band structure and surface carboxyl promote the efficiency of photocatalytic reforming of methanol and water at mild conditions, to contribute to the green co&#8208;cycle of carbon and hydrogen.







Abstract
As a reproducible intermediate for hydrogen (H2) and carbon cycling, methanol mixed with water (H2O) in a ratio of 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 can multiply the outcome of green H2 generation via Photocatalytic reforming of methanol&#8208;H2O (PRMW). Hitherto, low&#8208;energy and mild&#8208;condition PRMW remains a serious challenge. Here, the amino acid&#8208;derived carbon nitrides (ACN) were synthesized supramolecular precursor strategy for PRMW and achieved excellent performance (H2, 35.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1; CO2, 11.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1) under sunlight at 35&#8201;&#176;C. It was revealed that the surface&#8208;terminating carboxyl groups (&#8722;COOH) promote the dark dehydrogenation of methanol on MetCNx to form methoxy (*OCH3) and methylol (*CH2OH) simultaneously, with the hydroxyl (*OH) generated by photostimulated H2O oxidation promotes the C&#8722;H activation of formaldehyde, then leads the whole reaction into the formation of CO2 and three H2. The extended light absorption, enhanced charge separation and transport, and efficient surface reaction improve photocatalytic efficiency.

It&#8242;s all about oxygen! Photochemical upcycling of polystyrene occurs efficiently using an acridinium photocatalyst even under solar irradiation. However, contrary to expectations, the mechanism proceeds through the generation of reactive oxygen species.







Abstract
Polystyrene (PS) is a commodity plastic recalcitrant to chemical recycling or upcycling processes. Approaches aimed at deconstructing PS by photocatalytic means struggle to generate high&#8208;energy species capable of cleaving the robust C&#8722;H and C&#8722;C bonds of PS. We show that 9&#8208;mesityl&#8208;10&#8208;methylacridinium perchlorate (MA) is capable of upcycling various grades of PS substrates into up to 40&#8201;% benzoic acid (BAc), formic acid (FA) and small proportions of acetophenone (ACP), under visible light (456&#8197;nm) or through solar radiation. Time&#8208;resolved emission and absorption spectroscopy evidence that a reaction with oxygen is the primary photochemical step in oxygen&#8208;saturated solutions, accounting for 77&#8201;% of the photons absorbed vs. 1&#8201;% for the direct reaction with PS (0.303&#8197;M in repeating units). These results are in agreement with a mechanism in which MA&#8208;mediated photo upcycling of PS to BAc occurs through the abstraction of benzylic H atoms by reactive oxygen species generated by energy or electron transfer from the excited state of MA. Addition of triplet O2 to these radicals, followed by intra&#8208; or inter&#8208;molecular hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) generates C&#8208; or O&#8208;centered radicals then undergoing &#946;&#8208;scission or hydroperoxide fragmentation. The formation of intermediate oligomers functionalized by terminal carbonyl groups is demonstrated by both infrared analysis and MALDI TOF mass spectrometry. These oligomers undergo further photoinduced conversion even in the absence of MA, as evidenced by size exclusion chromatography analysis of the irradiated samples.

         <title>Solvent Polarity&#8208;Induced Regulation of Cation Solvation Sheaths for High&#8208;Voltage Zinc&#8208;Based Batteries with a 1.94 V Discharge Platform</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an efficient and universal strategy that utilizes solvent polarity&#8208;induced cation solvation sheath regulation to enhance the discharge voltage platform (up to 1.94&#8197;V) of Zn&#8208;based batteries.







Abstract
To address the challenge of low discharge platforms (&lt;1.5&#8197;V) in aqueous zinc&#8208;based batteries, highly concentrated salts have been explored due to their wide electrochemical window (~3&#8197;V). However, these electrolytes mainly prevent hydrogen evolution and dendrite growth at the anode without significantly enhancing voltage performance. Herein we introduce an approach by adjusting solvent polarity to regulate cation solvation sheaths in hybrid electrolytes, reducing Zn/Zn2+ oxidation potential and water activity. Through strong cation&#8208;water coordination and hydrogen bonding between dimethylsulfoxide and water, the designed electrolyte, at a low concentration, achieves a broader electrochemical window (4&#8197;V) than conventional concentrated electrolytes. Using this electrolyte, a Zn/Zn battery showed an impressive cycle life of 4340&#8197;cycles, while a Zn/lithium manganate battery delivered a high discharge platform of over 1.9&#8197;V with exceptional cycling stability. A Zn&#8208;based micro&#8208;battery with a polyvinyl alcohol&#8208;based hybrid electrolyte also achieved a record&#8208;high discharge platform of 1.94&#8197;V. This work presents a promising strategy for developing low&#8208;concentration electrolytes for high&#8208;performance sustainable energy storage.

         <title>Cooperative Active Sites on Ag2Pt3TiS6 for Enhanced Low&#8208;Temperature Ammonia Fuel Cell Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We discovered a new multi&#8208;element catalyst (Ag2Pt3TiS6) with enhanced ammonia oxidation reaction and oxygen reduction reaction mass activities compared to Pt/C. Through density functional theory calculations, we identify that this arises from active site motifs consisting of Pt and Ti atoms that work cooperatively. The bifunctional capability of Ag2Pt3TiS6 is demonstrated as both the cathode and anode in a direct ammonia fuel cell.







Abstract
Ammonia has attracted considerable interest as a hydrogen carrier that can help decarbonize global energy networks. Key to realizing this is the development of low temperature ammonia fuel cells for the on&#8208;demand generation of electricity. However, the efficiency of such systems is significantly impaired by the sluggish ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Here, we report the design of a bifunctional Ag2Pt3TiS6 electrocatalyst that facilitates both reactions at mass activities exceeding that of commercial Pt/C. Through comprehensive density functional theory calculations, we identify that active site motifs composed of Pt and Ti atoms work cooperatively to catalyze ORR and AOR. Notably, in situ shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS) experiments indicate a decreased propensity for *NOx formation and hence an increased resistance toward catalyst poisoning for AOR. Employing Ag2Pt3TiS6 as both the cathode and anode, we constructed a low temperature ammonia fuel cell with a high peak power density of 8.71&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and low Pt loading of 0.45&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Our findings demonstrate a pathway towards the rational design of effective electrocatalysts with multi&#8208;element active sites that work cooperatively.

         <title>Radiation&#8208;Sensitive Layered Hybrid Double Perovskites Driven by a Dual&#8208;Ion&#8208;Woven Supramolecular Framework for X&#8208;Ray Tomography</title>

         <dc:description>
The RP&#8208;like DJ&#8208;phase layered hybrid double perovskites (LHDPs) constructed by an unprecedented dual&#8208;ion&#8208;woven supramolecular framework are developed to boost interlayer charge transport, achieving a record&#8208;high sensitivity of 5250&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 among all the reported LHDP materials. A large&#8208;area [00l]&#8208;oriented composite membrane is prepared to obtain a high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray tomography, showcasing superior next&#8208;generation radiographic potential.







Abstract
A promising candidate for X&#8208;ray detection is layered hybrid double perovskites (LHDPs) with excellent structural stability, but their sensitivity is generally limited by unsatisfactory interlayer charge transport. Herein, employing one ethylenediamine (EDA) chain as a structural inducer, we successfully obtain unusual Dion&#8208;Jacobson (DJ) phase LHDPs, (EDABr)4AgBiBr8 and (EDABr)4CuBiBr8, featuring a Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper&#8208;like (RP&#8208;like) interlayer. Thanks to the bridging of bromine anions, organic cations are linked via charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonds, where two ionic spacers are orderly woven into a supramolecular framework. Consequently, the RP&#8208;like interlayer space is regulated by the dual&#8208;ion&#8208;woven supramolecular framework with embedded charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bond networks, remarkably enriching interlayer interactions and boosting charge transport. Through theoretical calculations, structural roles of the supramolecular framework are elucidated by extra orbital contribution and large diffusion barrier of Br anions. As proof of concept, the sensitivity of RP&#8208;like devices up to 5250&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is a record&#8208;high of LHDP&#8208;based X&#8208;ray detectors for now, while a low detection limit (91&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1) and outstanding radiation&#8208;resistant capability (50&#8197;Gyair) are achieved. Moreover, an oriented membrane device is prepared to demonstrate high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray tomography. These findings offer a brand&#8208;new interlayer&#8208;modulation strategy for the construction of sensitive and stable scintillation semiconductors.

         <title>sp Carbon Disrupting Axial Symmetry of Local Electric Field for Biomimetic Construction of Three&#8208;Dimensional Geometric and Electronic Structure in Nanozyme for Sensing and Microplastic Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the synergistic interaction between active centers and cofactors in natural enzymes, a three&#8208;dimensional graphene/copper nanoparticles/graphdiyne (G/Cu/GDY) nanozyme is developed. The incorporation of graphdiyne disrupts the axial symmetry of electron distribution on the surface of copper nanoparticles, resulting in an asymmetric electron configuration, which in turn generates a unique local electric field within the nanozyme. This electric field promotes rapid electron transfer, facilitating efficient interaction between substrate molecules and active sites, effectively replicating the characteristic electron transfer process of natural enzymes.







Abstract
The catalytic efficiency of natural enzymes depends on the precise electronic interactions between active centers and cofactors within a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) structure. Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) attempt to mimic this structure by modifying metal active sites with molecular ligands. However, SAzymes struggle to match the catalytic efficiency of natural enzymes due to constraints in active site proximity, quantity, and the inability to simulate electron transfer processes driven by internal electronic structures of natural enzymes. This study introduces a universal spatial engineering strategy in which molecular ligands are replaced with graphdiyne (GDY) to induce d&#8208;&#960; orbital hybridization with copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs), leading to an asymmetric electron&#8208;rich distribution along the longitudinal axis that mimics the local electric field of natural laccase. Moreover, multiple sp bonds within GDY scaffold effectively anchor Cu NPs, facilitating the construction of 3D geometric structure similar to that of natural laccase. An enzymatic activity of 82.53&#8197;U&#8201;mg&#8722;1 is achieved, 4.72&#8197;times higher than that of natural laccase. By reconstructing both 3D structures and local electric fields of natural enzymes through d&#8208;&#960; orbital hybridization, this approach enhances electron interactions between cofactors, active centers, and substrates, and offers a versatile framework for biomimetic design of nanozymes.

         <title>Tuning Proton Affinity on Co&#8722;N&#8722;C Atomic Interface to Disentangle Activity&#8208;Selectivity Trade&#8208;off in Acidic Oxygen Reduction to H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Increasing proton affinity over Co&#8722;N&#8722;C atomic interface via B doping is shown to direct proton attack to the former oxygen in *OOH, facilitating H2O2 formation without sacrificing activity. The obtained Co1&#8208;NBC catalyst exhibits remarkable 2e&#8722; ORR activity and selectivity at the same time, achieving ultrahigh H2O2 production ability.







Abstract
In oxygen reduction reaction to H2O2 via two&#8208;electron pathway (2e&#8722; ORR), adsorption strength of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates determines both catalytic activity and selectivity. However, it also causes activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off. Herein, we propose a novel strategy through modulating the interaction between protons and *OOH intermediates to break the activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off for highly active and selective 2e&#8722; ORR. Taking the typical cobalt&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon single&#8208;atom catalyst as an example, boron heteroatoms doped into second coordination sphere of CoN4 (Co1&#8208;NBC) increase proton affinity on catalyst surface, facilitating proton attack on the former oxygen of *OOH and thereby promoting H2O2 formation. As a result, Co1&#8208;NBC simultaneously achieves prominent 2e&#8722; ORR activity and selectivity in acid with onset potential of 0.724&#8197;V vs. RHE and H2O2 selectivity of 94&#8201;%, surpassing most reported catalysts. Furthermore, Co1&#8208;NBC exhibits a remarkable H2O2 productivity of 202.7&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a remarkable stability of 60&#8197;h at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in flow cell. This work provides new insights into resolving activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off in electrocatalysis.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Lewis Base Activation of Carbonyls and Hexafluorobenzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hitherto elusive side&#8208;on Pd(0) arene and organic carbonyl complexes are reported, as well as the catalytic hydrodefluorination of hexafluorobenzene by cyclohexene. Detailed spectroscopic studies and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations reveal that bonding between Pd(0) and &#960;&#8208;ligands may occur, opposed to common belief, by two different mechanisms. Hence, we present evidence for selective &#960;&#8208;Lewis base activation of &#960;&#8208;systems.







Abstract
We report hitherto elusive side&#8208;on &#951;2&#8208;bonded palladium(0) carbonyl (anthraquinone, benzaldehyde) and arene (benzene, hexafluorobenzene) palladium(0) complexes and present the catalytic hydrodefluorination of hexafluorobenzene by cyclohexene. The comparison with respective cyclohexene, pyridine and tetrahydrofuran complexes reveals that the experimental ligand binding strengths follow the order THF&lt;C6H6&lt;C6F6&lt;cyclohexene&lt;pyridine&lt;benzaldehyde&lt;anthraquinone. To understand this surprising order, the complexes&#8217; electronic structures were elucidated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), single crystal X&#8208;Ray diffraction (sc&#8208;XRD), ultraviolet/visible (UV/Vis) electronic absorption, infrared (IR) vibrational, Pd L3&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption (XAS), and X&#8208;ray photoelectron (XP) spectroscopic techniques, complemented by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations including energy decomposition (EDA&#8208;NOCV) and effective oxidation state (EOS) analyses. For benzene, pyridine and cyclohexene, bonding follows the donor/acceptor picture of the Dewar&#8211;Chatt&#8211;Duncanson model. In stark contrast, hexafluorobenzene, benzaldehyde and anthraquinone bind via essentially the &#960;&#8208;channel only and thus as &#960;&#8208;analogues of Z&#8208;acceptor ligands. This contribution elucidates the control of functional&#8208;group selectivity in palladium(0) catalysis and delineates a novel strategy to activate electron&#8208;deficient &#960;&#8208;systems.

         <title>Metallaphotoredox Enabled Single Carbon Atom Insertion into Alkenes for Allene Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of mild and efficient methods for molecular editing has become a crucial approach in pharmaceutical discovery. In this work, a photoredox and cobalt&#8208;catalyzed gem&#8208;dibromocyclopropane rearrangement reaction has been devised and applied to the late&#8208;stage allenylation of complex alkenes. In contrast to the harsh conditions of traditional Doering&#8208;LaFlamme reactions, this method features mild conditions, broad substrate scope, and compatibility with various functional groups. A series of mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations suggest that this reaction may proceed through tertiary radical and cyclopropane carbene intermediates.







Abstract
Efficient methods for synthesizing allenes from readily available starting materials pose a persistent challenge in organic chemistry. In this work, we present a novel two&#8208;stage protocol for allene synthesis involving the single&#8208;atom insertion into alkenes, facilitated by synergistic photoredox and cobalt catalysis. Diverging from conventional methods such as the Doering&#8208;LaFlamme reaction, this photochemical rearrangement approach operates efficiently under mild conditions in a radical&#8208;based manner. The protocol exhibits a broad substrate scope and demonstrates applicability in the late&#8208;stage diversification of alkene&#8208;containing natural products and bioactive molecules. Preliminary mechanistic studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations offer insights into the reaction pathway, indicating a radical mechanism involving fleeting cyclopropyl carbene intermediates followed by rapid ring opening to form allenes.

A single&#8208;atom catalyst Ni&#8722;NSC with undercoordinated Ni&#8722;N3 moieties implanting in N,S&#8208;codoped porous carbon enhanced polysulfide conversion kinetics, significantly improving the adsorption, diffusion and reduce reaction energy barrier during sulfur redox reaction. The Li&#8722;S battery employing Ni&#8722;NSC demonstrated high reversible capacity, superior rate capability and outstanding cycling stability.







Abstract
Developing efficient and durable single&#8208;atom catalysts is vitally important for the sulfur redox reaction (SROR) in Li&#8722;S battery, while it remains enormous challenging. Herein, undercoordinated Ni&#8722;N3 moieties anchored on N,S&#8208;codoped porous carbon (Ni&#8722;NSC) is obtained to enhance the SROR. The experiments and theoretical calculations indicate that the symmetry&#8208;breaking charge transfer in Ni single&#8208;atom catalyst originates from tuning effect of sulfur atoms mediated Ni&#8722;N3 moieties, which can both facilitate the chemical adsorption by formation of N&#8722;Ni&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Sn2&#8722;, and achieve a rapid redox conversion of polysulfides because of the enhanced electron transfer. As results, the Ni&#8722;NSC based Li&#8722;S battery delivers a very high initial reversible capacity (1025&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;C), as well as outstanding cycling&#8208;stability for 2400&#8197;cycles at 2&#8197;C and 3&#8197;C, respectively. Noteworthy, the areal capacity can reach 7.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.05&#8197;C and a retention capacity of 4.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 after 100&#8197;cycles at 0.2&#8197;C for Ni&#8722;NSC based Li&#8722;S battery with sulfur loading of 5.88&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work provides profound insight for rational optimizing microscopic electronic density of active site to promoting SROR in metal&#8208;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Bridging Cyclic Bilatriene Analogue Affords Stable &#960;&#8208;Radicaloid Dyes with Near&#8208;Infrared II Absorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unique redox non&#8208;innocent metal&#8208;radicaloid species with an acyclic porphyrinoid structure have been synthesized upon bridging rhodium/iridium&#8208;COD cations at outer nitrogen sites. The resulting complexes exhibit high stability under ambient conditions, redox versatility, and distinct near&#8208;infrared absorption up to 1500&#8197;nm, and are promising candidates for NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;responsive photothermal and photoacoustic imaging contrast agents.







Abstract
Stable neutral metal radicaloid complexes have been synthesized from a modified tetrapyrrolic pigment, bilatriene, with iridium(I) and rhodium(I) cyclooctadiene (COD) synthons. The bilatriene skeleton contains &#945;&#8208;linked conjugated pyrrole units, whereas an N&#8208;confused analogue used in this work possesses &#946;&#8208;linked pyrrole moieties at the terminal, demonstrating a unique metal binding capability. Unprecedentedly, the metal&#8208;COD cations are accommodated at the outer nitrogen sites, which induced the formation of open&#8208;shell metal&#8208;radicaloid species. The resulting compounds are highly stable under ambient conditions and demonstrated facile redox conversion to afford the corresponding cation and anion species. Furthermore, the radicaloid complexes showed a distinct second near&#8208;infrared absorption (NIR&#8208;II) capability extending up to 1500&#8197;nm along with high photostability. These features emphasized that the complexes can be potential NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;responsible photothermal and photoacoustic imaging contrast agents based on the metal&#8208;radicaloid dye platform.

         <title>Stable Xanthene Radicals and Their Heavy Chalcogen Analogues Showing Tunable Doublet Emission from Green to Near&#8208;infrared</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable 9&#8208;aryl&#8208;xanthene radicals and their heavy chalcogen analogues have been synthesized, which exhibit doublet emission ranging from green to near&#8208;infrared (527&#8211;714 nm) in solution and solid&#8208;state matrix. Notably, the selenium&#8208;substituted radical demonstrates a significantly enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield of 41% when doped into its precursor solid.







Abstract
Organic luminescent radicals, unlike traditional closed&#8208;shell fluorescent emitters, exhibit distinct luminescence mechanisms, offering promising potential for optoelectronic devices. To date, stable luminescent radicals have predominantly been confined to polychlorinated triphenylmethyl radicals, underscoring the need for new platforms to expand their emission spectra. In this study, we report the synthesis of stable 9&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted xanthene radicals and their heavy chalcogen analogues (1&#8201;a&#8211;c and 2&#8201;a&#8211;c), which exhibited excellent chemical stability and emission ranging from green to near&#8208;infrared (527&#8211;714&#8197;nm). Notably, the selenium&#8208;substituted radical (1&#8201;c) demonstrates a significantly enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield of 41&#8201;% when doped into its precursor solid. Additionally, the introduction of methoxyphenyl groups has largely enhanced the stability of the radical, showcasing an excellent photostability with the longest half&#8208;life of around 1792&#8197;h. The high internal quantum efficiency of up to 81&#8201;% was further validated in organic light&#8208;emitting diode. This study introduces a novel class of stable carbon&#8208;centered radicals with high tunability and functionality for photoelectric applications.

         <title>Inverse Vulcanization of Aziridines: Enhancing Polysulfides for Superior Mechanical Strength and Adhesive Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triaziridine crosslinker, SaC&#8208;100, is used in inverse vulcanization to create polysulfides with superior mechanical strength. These polymers exhibit exceptional adhesion to various substrates and maintain their performance at extremely low temperatures.







Abstract
This study introduces a novel approach to inverse vulcanization by utilizing a commercially available triaziridine crosslinker as an alternative to conventional olefin&#8208;based crosslinkers. The model reactions reveal a self&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening of &#8220;unactivated&#8221; aziridine with elemental sulfur, forming oligosulfide&#8208;functionalized diamines. The triaziridine&#8208;derived polysulfides exhibit impressive mechanical properties, achieving a maximum stress of ~8.3&#8197;MPa and an elongation at break of ~107&#8201;%. The incorporation of silicon dioxide (20&#8197;wt&#8201;%) enhances the composite's rigidity, yielding a Young's modulus of ~0.94&#8197;GPa. Furthermore, these polysulfides display excellent adhesion strength on various substrates, such as aluminum (~7.0&#8197;MPa), walnut (~9.6&#8197;MPa), and steel (~11.0&#8197;MPa), with substantial retention of adhesion strength (~3.3&#8197;MPa on steel) at &#8722;196&#8201;&#176;C. The straightforward synthetic process, combined with the accessibility of the triaziridine crosslinker, emphasizes the potential for further innovations in sulfur polymer chemistry.

         <title>Palladium Single Atom&#8208;supported Covalent Organic Frameworks for Aqueous&#8208;phase Hydrogenative Hydrogenolysis of Aromatic Aldehydes via Hydrogen Heterolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ&#8208;generated H+&#8722;H&#8722; pairs by hydrogen heterolysis on palladium single atom&#8208;supported covalent organic framework act as hydrogenation sites for C=O group and hydrogenolysis sites for C&#8722;OH group. The close intimate hydrogenation and acid sites show unprecedented hydrogenative hydrogenolysis route of aromatic aldehydes in a water solvent at room temperature.







Abstract
Developing a method for the tandem hydrogenative hydrogenolysis of bio&#8208;based furfuryl aldehydes to methylfurans is crucial for synthesizing sustainable biofuels and chemicals; however, it poses a challenge due to the easy hydrogenation of the C=C bond and difficult cleavage of the C&#8722;O bond. Herein, a palladium (Pd) single&#8208;atom&#8208;supported covalent organic framework was fabricated and showed a unique 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran yield of up to 98.2&#8201;% when reacted with 5&#8208;methyl furfuryl aldehyde in an unprecedented water solvent at 30&#8201;&#176;C. Furthermore, it exhibited excellent catalytic universality while converting various furfuryl&#8208;, benzyl&#8208;, and heterocyclic aldehydes at room temperature. The analysis of the catalytic mechanism confirmed that H2 was heterolytically activated on the Pd&#8722;N pair and triggered the keto&#8208;enol tautomerism of the covalent organic frameworks (COFs) host, resulting in H&#8722;&#8722;Pd&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O&#8722;H+ sites. These sites served as novel asymmetric hydrogenation sites for the C=O group and hydrogenolysis sites for the C&#8722;OH group through a scarce SN2 mechanism. This study demonstrated remarkable bifunctional catalysis through the H2&#8208;induced keto&#8208;enol tautomerism of COF catalysts for the atypical preparation of methyl aromatics in a water solvent at room temperature.

         <title>An Advanced 3D Crosslinked Conductive Binder for Silicon Anodes: Leveraging Glycerol Chemistry for Superior Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel n&#8208;type conductive crosslinked binder (POD&#8208;c&#8208;GL) has been successfully developed, combining enhanced electronic and ionic conductivities with dynamic crosslinking chemistry. This innovative binder significantly improves silicon anodes&#8217; rate capability and cycling stability by efficiently dissipating stress and maintaining a robust electrode structure. The study comprehensively analyzes the binder's conductivity changes pre&#8208; and post&#8208;doping, addressing critical gaps in n&#8208;type conductive polymer research and paving the way for advanced lithium&#8208;ion battery applications







Abstract
Silicon (Si) anodes hold great promise for high&#8208;capacity lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), yet their practical application is hindered by severe volume expansion and mechanical degradation. To tackle these challenges, we present an innovative 3D crosslinked conductive polyoxadiazole (POD) binder engineered with glycerol (GL) to form a robust network of covalent and hydrogen bonds. This unique chemical architecture not only enhances adhesion and mechanical resilience to effectively dissipate the stresses induced by Si's volumetric changes but also constructs a robust conductive framework to facilitate electron transfer. The dynamic interplay between strong covalent and flexible hydrogen bonds in the POD&#8208;c&#8208;GL binder enables superior structural integrity and stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) during cycling. The Si@POD&#8208;c&#8208;GL anode exhibits remarkable electrochemical performance, including a high initial Coulombic efficiency, impressive rate capability, and outstanding cycling stability. This work highlights the potential of harnessing in situ crosslinking chemistry to develop advanced binders, paving the way for the next generation of high&#8208;performance Si anodes in LIBs.

         <title>Heavy Pentaisopropylcyclopentadienyltriylenes and their Heterobimetallic Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and characterization of pentaisopropylcyclopentadienyltriylenes of gallium, indium and thallium (5CpGa; 5CpIn; 5CpTl) is reported. Their application as ligands in a series of heterobimetallic complexes is demonstrated, including a heterobimetallic polydecker of gallium and lithium.







Abstract
A series of triylenes of the heavy group&#8197;13 elements gallium, indium and thallium, carrying the pentaisopropylcyclopentadienyl ligand is reported. The compounds were characterized in solution and in the solid&#8208;state and their donor ligand properties in heterobimetallic complexes were investigated, whereby a series of tungsten carbonyl complexes was isolated. Furthermore, a new synthetic route towards a previously described lithium&#8208;aluminum heterobimetallic dimetallocene is reported, which also enabled the isolation of a heterobimetallic polydecker of lithium and gallium.

         <title>Exploration of Chemical Space Through Automated Reasoning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work we develop an automated reasoning method, COMGEN to determine valid compositions for a given set of domain expert defined constraints. We demonstrate the method in an automated workflow with crystal structure prediction and properties models to locate and predict new potential Li&#8208;ion solid state electrolytes.







Abstract
The vast size of composition space poses a significant challenge for materials chemistry: exhaustive enumeration of potentially interesting compositions is typically infeasible, hindering assessment of important criteria ranging from novelty and stability to cost and performance. We report a tool, Comgen, for the efficient exploration of composition space, which makes use of logical methods from computer science used for proving theorems. We demonstrate how these techniques, which have not previously been applied to materials discovery, can enable reasoning about scientific domain knowledge provided by human experts. Comgen accepts a variety of user&#8208;specified criteria, converts these into an abstract form, and utilises a powerful automated reasoning algorithm to identify compositions that satisfy these user requirements, or prove that the requirements cannot be simultaneously satisfied. In contrast to machine learning techniques, explicitly reasoning about domain knowledge, rather than making inferences from data, ensures that Comgen's outputs are fully interpretable and provably correct. Users interact with Comgen through a high&#8208;level Python interface. We illustrate use of the tool with several case studies focused on the search for new ionic conductors. Further, we demonstrate the integration of Comgen into an end&#8208;to&#8208;end automated workflow to propose and evaluate candidate compositions quantitatively, prior to experimental investigation. This highlights the potential of automated formal reasoning in materials chemistry.

Azatriangulenetrione unit is first incorporated into COF backbone to form a high&#8208;performance COF electrode with intrinsic multiple reachable redox&#8208;active sites of C=O, C=N and C=C, which delivers a superb discharge capacity of 410.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 in SIBs.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) suffer from sluggish kinetics, large volume change, and limited specific capacity due to the large radius of Na+. These issues can be solved through using covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as electrodes. Herein, an azatriangulenetrione&#8208;containing COF (denoted as CityU&#8208;33) was designed and synthesized as an electrode material for SIBs. Due to its inherent abundance of multiple redox&#8208;active sites and fast intercalation kinetics, CityU&#8208;33 delivered a high discharge capacity of 410.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and showed remarkable long&#8208;term cycling stability, where a discharge capacity of 288&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with 97&#8201;% retention over 2000&#8197;cycles was achieved, making it the top COF electrode material for SIBs.

Due to its inherent abundance of multiple redox-active sites and fast intercalation kinetics, CityU-33 delivered a high discharge capacity of 410.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and showed remarkable long-term cycling stability, where a discharge capacity of 288&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with 97&#8201;% retention over 2000&#8197;cycles was achieved, making it the top COF electrode material for SIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strength in Numbers: A Giant NIR&#8208;II AIEgen with One&#8208;for&#8208;All Phototheranostic Features for Exceptional Orthotopic Bladder Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;heteroacenes (NHAs) based second near&#8208;infrared AIE&#8208;active molecules are developed elaborately and found that there is strength in numbers as enhanced photophysical properties are obtained by increasing the fusing rings of NHAs and numbers of donors. The giant molecule 4TT&#8208;PBPT shows excellent one&#8208;for&#8208;all phototheranostic features and can be explored for unprecedented fluorescence&#8208;photoacoustic&#8208;photothermal trimodal imaging guided photodynamic&#8208;photothermal synergistic therapy for orthotopic bladder cancer.







Abstract
One&#8208;for&#8208;all phototheranostics that allows the simultaneous implementations of multiple optical imaging and therapeutic modalities by utilizing a single component, is growing into a sparkling frontier in cancer treatment. Of particular interest is phototheranostic agent with emission in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window. Nevertheless, the practical uses of those conventional NIR&#8208;II agents are severely impeded by their unsatisfactory features including insufficient stability, low synthetic yield, to be extended absorption/ emission wavelengths, and inefficient phototheranostic outcomes. Developing exceptional phototheranostic agents is thus highly desirable yet remains formidably challenging. Herein, we synthesized two novel N&#8208;heteroacenes&#8208;based NIR&#8208;II luminogens, namely 2TT&#8208;PPT and 4TT&#8208;PBPT, by respectively employing pyrene&#8208;fused phenaziothiadiazoles and pyrene&#8208;fused bisphenaziothiadiazoles as acceptor skeletons. There is strength in numbers by increasing the fusing rings in N&#8208;heteroacenes moieties and numbers of appended donors. Compared to less ring&#8208;fused 2TT&#8208;PPT, the giant molecule 4TT&#8208;PBPT shows improved photophysical characteristics, such as enhanced light absorbance, red&#8208;shifted wavelengths, higher brightness, favorable reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and elevated photothermal conversion efficiency, which render 4TT&#8208;PBPT nanoparticles excellent fluorescence&#8208;photoacoustic&#8208;photothermal trimodal imaging guided photodynamic&#8208;photothermal synergistic therapy for orthotopic bladder cancer.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework with Dense Lithiophilic Sites as Protective Layer to Enable High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (3D COF) with dense lithiophilic sites as an anodic protective layer based quasi&#8208;three dimensional 6&#8208;connected phosphazene and 4&#8208;connected porphyrin. Both phosphazene and porphyrin rings in the COF served as electron&#8208;rich and lithiophilic sites, enhanced a homogeneous Li+ flux via 3D direction towards highly smooth and compact Li deposition on the current collector.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal batteries with remarkable energy densities are restrained by short lifetime and low Coulombic efficiency (CE), resulting from the accumulative Li dendrites and dead Li during cycling. Here, we prepared a new three&#8208;dimensional (3D) covalent organic framework (COF) with dense lithiophilic sites (heteoatom weight contents of 32.32&#8197;wt&#8201;%) as an anodic protective layer of Li metal batteries. The 3D COF was synthesized using a [6+4] synthesis strategy by inducing flexible 6&#8208;connected cyclotriphosphazene derivative aldehyde and 4&#8208;connected porphyrin&#8208;based tetraphenylamines. Both phosphazene and porphyrin rings in the COF served as electron&#8208;rich and lithiophilic sites, enhancing a homogeneous Li+ flux via 3D direction towards highly smooth and compact Li deposition. The Li/Por&#8208;PN&#8208;COF&#8208;Cu cells achieved a record average CE of 99.1&#8201;% for 320&#8197;cycles with smooth Li deposition. Meanwhile, the abundant lithiophilic sites can promote fast Li+ transport with Li+ transference number of 0.87, enabling LiFePO4 full cell with stable stripping/plating processes even at a harsh rate of 5&#8197;C. Theoretical calculations revealed that the strong interaction force between Li+ and the COF facilitated the dissolution of Li+ from the electrolyte, and the low migration barrier of 1.08&#8197;eV indicated a favorable interaction between the Li+ ions and the &#960;&#8208;electron system.

         <title>Regulating Intermolecular Hydrogen Bonds in Organic Cathode Materials to Realize Ultra&#8208;stable, Flexible and Low&#8208;temperature Aqueous Zinc&#8208;organic Batteries</title>

An intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding regulation strategy in organic cathode materials can realize ultra&#8208;stable, fast&#8208;charging/discharging, flexible, and low&#8208;temperature aqueous zinc&#8208;organic battery.







Abstract
Rational design of molecular structures is one of the effective strategies to obtain high&#8208;performance organic cathode materials. However, besides the optimization of single&#8208;molecule structures, the influence of the &#8220;weak&#8221; interaction forces (e.g. hydrogen bonds) in organic cathode materials on the performance of batteries should be fully considered. Herein, three organic small molecules with different numbers of hydroxyl groups (namely nitrogen heterocyclic tetraketone (DAB), monohydroxyl nitrogen heterocyclic dione (HDA), dihydroxyl nitrogen heterocyclic dione (DHT)) were selected as the cathodes of aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs), and the effect of the intermolecular hydrogen bonds on their electrochemical performance was studied for the first time. Clearly, the stable hydrogen&#8208;bond networks built through the hydroxyl groups significantly enhance the cycle stability of organic small&#8208;molecule cathodes and facilitate rapid proton conduction between the hydrogen&#8208;bond networks through the Grotthuss mechanism, thereby endowing them with excellent rate performance. In addition, a larger and more dense two&#8208;dimensional hydrogen&#8208;bond network can be constructed through multiple hydroxyl groups, further enhancing the structural stability of organic small&#8208;molecule cathodes, giving them better cycle tolerance, excellent rate performance, and extreme environmental tolerance.

         <title>Self&#8208;promoted Controlled Ring&#8208;opening Polymerization via Side Chain&#8208;mediated Proton Transfer for the Synthesis of Tertiary Amine&#8208;pendant Polypeptoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study utilizes side chain&#8208;assisted strategy to accelerate chain propagation by using NCAs with tertiary amine pendants. This is the first report of the direct synthesis of tertiary amine&#8208;pendant polypeptoids by self&#8208;promoted ring&#8208;opening polymerization of tertiary amine&#8208;pendant NCAs.







Abstract
Proton transfer is essential in virtually all biochemical processes, with enzymes facilitating this transfer by optimizing the proximity and orientation of reactants through site&#8208;specific hydrogen bonds. Proton transfer is also crucial in the rate&#8208;determining step for the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides (NCAs), widely used to prepare various peptidomimetic materials. This study utilizes side chain&#8208;assisted strategy to accelerate the rate of chain propagation by using NCAs with tertiary amine pendants. This moiety enables hydrogen bond formation between the incoming NCA and the polymer amino growing end. The tertiary amine side chain of the NCA forms a proton shuttle, via a less constrained transition state, to facilitate the proton transfer process. Moreover, the tertiary amine side chains enable the precipitation of NCA monomers through in situ protonation during the monomer synthesis. This greatly facilitates the synthesis of these unreported monomers, allowing the direct controlled synthesis of tertiary amine&#8208;pendant polypeptoids. This side chain&#8208;promoted polymerization has rarely been reported. Additionally, the tertiary amine side chains, as widely used functional groups, endow the polymers with unique properties including pH&#8208; and thermo&#8208;responsiveness, tunable pKas, and siRNA transfection capability. The self&#8208;promoted synthesis, facile monomer preparation, and attractive properties make tertiary amine&#8208;pendant polypeptoids promising materials for various applications.

         <title>Unraveling the Configuration Modulation in Spiro&#8208;Based Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) materials show potential for optoelectronic applications. This study unravels how spatial configuration impacts TSCT properties. Different photophysical properties were observed in a series of spiro&#8208;based TSCT materials. Their external quantum efficiencies range from 28.0&#8201;% to 3.6&#8201;%, highlighting the importance of spatial arrangement.







Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials hold promise for optoelectronic applications. Among various design strategies, through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) systems offer the potential for enhanced performance. However, the relationship between molecular configuration and TSCT properties remains unclear compared to traditional through&#8208;band charge transfer materials. In this study, we investigated the influence of spatial configuration on TSCT features and electronic properties of triplet excited states in these TSCT materials. By manipulating the spatial arrangement between donor and acceptor segments using different spiro skeletons, a series of TSCT materials (DMB2&#8208;DMB5) was synthesized. Together with the parent molecule, DM&#8208;B, these materials exhibited completely different TADF characteristics, demonstrating the impact of spatial arrangements on their optoelectronic properties. Thus, the external quantum efficiency of these materials ranged from as high as 28.0&#8201;% (DMB2) to as low as 3.6&#8201;% (DMB5) due to variations in their TADF characteristics. Our findings highlight the significance of spatial configuration, beyond distance alone, in influencing TSCT properties when donor and acceptor segments are sufficiently close. This insight provides valuable guidance for developing advanced TSCT materials and advancing TADF systems with improved performance and functionality.

         <title>Precisely Tuning Band Gaps of Hexabenzocoronene&#8208;Based MOFs Toward Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research is the first example to introduce systematic substituents and large conjugated aromatic structure (13 benzene rings) into a long&#8208;range ordered framework simultaneously and achieved directionally modification of nanographene&#8208;containing MOFs. These twelve MOFs exhibited broad and tunable band gaps over 1.41&#8197;eV (ranging from 3.25&#8197;eV to 1.84&#8197;eV), and the photocatalytic CO2 conversion rate raised by 33.2&#8208;fold.







Abstract
Precise adjusting the band gaps in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is crucial for improving their visible&#8208;light absorption capacity during photocatalysis, presenting both a formidable challenge and a charming opportunity. This present study employed a symmetry&#8208;reduction strategy to pre&#8208;design six novel 4&#8208;connected ligands with systematic substituents (&#8722;NO2, &#8208;H, &#8208;tBu, &#8208;OCH3, &#8208;OH and &#8208;NH2) and synthesized the corresponding pillared&#8208;layer Zr&#8208;MOFs (NKM&#8208;668) retaining the hexaphenylbenzene fragment. Subsequently, the NKM&#8208;668 MOFs were transformed into large&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated hexabenzocoronene&#8208;based MOFs (pNKM&#8208;668) via the Scholl reaction. These twelve MOFs exhibited broad and tunable band gaps over 1.41&#8197;eV (ranging from 3.25&#8197;eV to 1.84&#8197;eV), and the photocatalytic CO2 conversion rate raised by 33.2&#8208;fold. This study not only enriches the type of hexaphenylbenzene&#8208;based MOFs, but also paves the way for nanographene&#8208;containing MOFs in the further application of photocatalysis.

         <title>Diastereoselective Anomeric C(sp3)&#8722;H Cyclization Towards the Design of New Cyclophane&#8208;Braced Glycopeptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient Pd&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H anomeric activation approach has been developed for the synthesis of cyclophane&#8208;braced glycopeptides. This technique is versatile and can be applied to glycopeptides of various cyclic sizes. In addition, biological evaluations of some glycophanes revealed that this series exhibits promising antiproliferative activity against various cancer cell lines.







Abstract
Here we report a macrocyclization route towards the synthesis of glycophane peptides by a selective C&#8722;H arylation of the anomeric bond. This approach demonstrates the power of Pd&#8208;catalysis C&#8722;H activation to access unusual cyclic peptides.

         <title>Using a New Pt(II) Source to Make Pt(II) Lantern&#8208;Shaped Cages, Including Low&#8208;Symmetry, Heteroleptic, and Multicavity Examples</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new Pt(II) starting material is cheap and easy to make, with exceptional air stability. It was used to synthesise [Pt2L4]4+ lantern&#8208;shaped cages including their first heteroleptic, low&#8208;symmetry and multicavity examples.







Abstract
Current synthetic methods towards Pt(II) lantern&#8208;shaped cages involve the use of dry solvent, inert atmosphere, lengthy reaction times, and highly variable yields if isolated. Starting materials such as [Pt(CH3CN)4](BF4)2 suffer from a poor shelf&#8208;life, reducing the synthetic accessibility of various Pt(II) architectures. A new Pt(II) source (with varied counterions), [Pt(3&#8208;ClPy)4](X)2 (3&#8208;ClPy=3&#8208;chloropyridine, X=BF4&#8722;, OTf&#8722;, NO3&#8722;), is developed and characterised, showing greatly enhanced shelf&#8208;life characteristics under ambient atmospheric conditions. Using this starting material, the assembly of Pt(II) lantern&#8208;shaped cages was completed in as little as 1.5&#8197;hours with wet solvent and ambient atmosphere. The first examples of low&#8208;symmetry, heteroleptic and multicavity Pt(II) lantern&#8208;shaped cages are reported using this approach. Attempts towards an M6L8 octahedron using a tritopic ligand instead generate an interesting M2L4 cage with unbound pyridyl arms. Ligands and cages are characterised by NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and X&#8208;ray crystallography in some cases.

A molecular engineering approach was employed to yield a series of membrane&#8208;anchoring cationic NIR&#8208;II small molecules, which could amplify plasma membrane rupture by mild NIR&#8208;II photothermal effects, leading to rapid cell necrotic death and enhancing antitumor immunotherapy.







Abstract
Immunotherapy is a promising cancer treatment method for eradicating tumor cells by enhancing the immune response. However, there are several major obstacles to conventional phototherapy&#8208;mediated immune responses, including inadequate immunogenicity and immunosuppressive environment. Here, we present a novel photoimmunotherapy modality&#8212;the development of membrane&#8208;anchoring small molecule inducing plasma membrane rupture (PMR) by NIR&#8208;II photo&#8208;stimulation, thus evoking cell necrotic death and enhancing antitumor immunotherapy. Our top&#8208;performing membrane&#8208;anchoring small molecule (CBT&#8208;3) exhibits temperature&#8208;tunable PMR efficiency, allowing rapid necrotic death in cancer cells at 50&#8197;&#956;M dose by using exogenous NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;mediated mild photothermal effect (1064&#8197;nm, 0.6&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Further evidence indicated that this gentle therapeutic approach activated inflammatory signaling pathways in cells, enhanced immunogenic cell death, and reshaped the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, ultimately promoting systemic antitumor immune responses in vivo. This study represents the first instance of utilizing NIR&#8208;II photo&#8208;amplified PMR effect based on membrane&#8208;anchoring small molecule, providing a novel avenue for advancing cancer photoimmunotherapy.

         <title>Declined S1 but Constant T1 Energy: Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence with Triplet Blocking Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have demonstrated a new approach of &#916;EST modulation via the triplet blocking effect, achieving decreased S1 but constant T1 energy level. The conflict between small &#916;EST and large oscillator strengths is relieved. The results are crucial for fundamental photophysics as well as development of optoelectronic materials.







Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules have been widely investigated in organic light emitting diodes (OLED), organic lasing, etc. Small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST) and high radiative rate constants (kF) are highly desired to utilize triplet excitons efficiently and are beneficial to reduce efficiency roll&#8208;off of devices of OLED devices. The prevalent TADF molecules are via donor&#8208;acceptor molecular design, for which the decreasing of the &#916;EST is often at the expense of reducing the kF. Herein, we demonstrated a new &#916;EST modulation approach to construct TADF with high kF, based on triplet blocking effect, i.e., the extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation of a triplet constrainer (IB) leads to a gradually red&#8208;shifted S1 but a constant T1 energy and therefore reduced &#916;EST controlled from monomer (IB), monomer&#8208;linker (IB&#8208;BF2), to dimer of IB&#8208;BF2&#8208;IB. The natural transition orbital analysis indicates that S1 state is delocalized while T1 state is localized as confirmed by time resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Therefore, the &#916;EST is reduced from 0.60&#8197;eV, 0.46&#8197;eV to 0.25&#8197;eV, while keeping faster radiation rate (around 108&#8197;s&#8722;1) than that of conventional donor&#8208;acceptor molecules (106&#8764;107&#8197;s&#8722;1). As a result, the emission mechanisms are regulated from fluorescence for IB, phosphorescence/TADF dual emissions for IB&#8208;BF2 to TADF for IB&#8208;BF2&#8208;IB. This paper proposed a new approach of &#916;EST modulation and a new type of TADF molecule with high radiation rate, which is crucial for fundamental photophysics as well as material science.

         <title>Direct Regeneration of Industrial LiFePO4 Black Mass Through A Glycerol&#8208;Enabled Granule Reconstruction Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a glycerol&#8208;enabled multi&#8208;faceted repair strategy, LiFePO4 industrial mass is regenerated at a low cost directly. The as&#8208;repaired LiFePO4 exhibits a high discharge capacity of 123.2&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 500&#8197;cycles at 5.0&#8197;C with a capacity retention rate of 93.1&#8201;%.







Abstract
With the increasing sales of electric vehicles, lots of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) assembled with LiFePO4 (LFP) cathodes will retire in the next few years, posing a significant challenge for their effective and environmentally&#8208;friendly recycling. The main reason why spent LFP cathodes fail to re&#8208;utilize lies in the lattice defects caused by lithium loss and structural defects resulting from stress accumulation. In this work, we propose an in situ granule reconstruction strategy to directly regenerate spent LFP black mass (S&#8722;BM) using glycerol in industry settings. The hydroxyl groups abundant in glycerol serves as electron donor that help reduce Fe&#8197;(III) and repair Fe&#8722;Li antisite defects (FeLi). Additionally, the chelating properties of glycerol intervene with structurally disintegrated particles, inhibiting Oswald ripening effect and promoting bonding of grain boundaries to generate lamellar microcrystals with homogeneous grain size, recover their morphology and crystal structure after a facile annealing procedure. Furthermore, the regenerated LFP restores Fe&#8722;O bonds which further inhibits structural distortion and improve Li+ migration kinetics. As a result, the regenerated industrial LFP black mass (R&#8722;BM) exhibits superior lithium storage performance with a discharge capacity of 123.2&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 500&#8197;cycles at 5.0&#8197;C (a capacity retention rate of 93.1&#8201;%).

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Dependent Divergent Cyclization of Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the solvent&#8208;dependent divergent 1,2&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;cyclization of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes were achieved. This protocol straightforwardly led to a diverse range of oxa&#8208;bicyclic heptanes, which may serve as lead bioisosteres in drug discovery, as well as highly functionalized cyclobutanes with exceptional diastereoselectivity. Mechanistic investigation revealed that solvent effects dominate the reaction pathway, as the rate of acid&#8208;catalyzed isomerization of BCBs varies with different solvents. Furthermore, the gram&#8208;scale reactions and various post&#8208;synthetic modifications of the products demonstrated their potential applications in synthetic chemistry.







Abstract
Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) have recently garnered significant research interest as versatile precursors for synthesizing potential [n.1.1] bioisosteres and multi&#8208;functionalized cyclobutanes in a straightforward and atom&#8208;economical manner. Here, we report a solvent&#8208;dependent divergent cyclization of BCBs that provides highly diastereospecific decorated cyclobutanes and oxygen&#8208;containing bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes (BCHeps), which serve as bioisosteres of meta&#8208;substituted arenes. Additionally, an unprecedented 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization reaction mode for BCBs was explored, thus expanding the chemical space of arene bioisosteres and highly functionalized cyclobutanes.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Tetrasubstituted Alkenes by Copper&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8211;H Functionalization of Arenes with Vinyl Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C(sp2)&#8208;H functionalization of arenes with vinyl cations has been realized, enabling the atom&#8208;economical preparation of axially chiral acyclic tetrasubstituted alkenes. This transformation is the first example of the assembly of atropisomeric alkenes via vinyl cations. Notably, the constructed axially chiral skeletons were shown to be applicable to asymmetric catalysis.







Abstract
Axially chiral tetrasubstituted alkenes are of increasing value and interest in chemistry&#8208;related areas. However, their catalytic asymmetric synthesis remains elusive, owing to the high steric repulsion and relatively low conformational stability. Herein, we disclose the straightforward construction of atropisomeric tetrasubstituted alkenes by effective enantiocontrol in a reaction with vinyl cation intermediates. This copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C(sp2)&#8208;H functionalization of sterically hindered (hetero)arenes with vinyl cations enables the efficient and atom&#8208;economical preparation of axially chiral acyclic tetrasubstituted styrenes and pyrrolyl ethylenes with high atroposelectivities. Importantly, this reaction represents the first example of the assembly of axially chiral alkenes via vinyl cations. Computational mechanistic studies reveal the reaction mechanism, origin of regioselectivity, Z/E selectivity and enantioselectivity. The synthetic utility has been demonstrated by diverse product derivatizations, chiral organocatalyst synthesis, as well as further applications in asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Expedited SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Protease Inhibitor Discovery through Modular &#8216;Direct&#8208;to&#8208;Biology&#8217; Screening</title>

Direct&#8208;to&#8208;biology workflows promise to accelerate hit optimisation for drug discovery. Here, we describe a direct&#8208;to&#8208;biology method for the efficient synthesis and screening of cysteine&#8208;reactive fragments and its application in the optimisation of a micromolar inhibitor of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease towards nanomolar covalent analogues. Additionally, we describe an under&#8208;reported switch from the covalent series to a potent, non&#8208;covalent series.







Abstract
Reactive fragment (RF) screening has emerged as an efficient method for ligand discovery across the proteome, irrespective of a target's perceived tractability. To date, however, the efficiency of subsequent optimisation campaigns has largely been low&#8208;throughput, constrained by the need for synthesis and purification of target compounds. We report an efficient platform for &#8216;direct&#8208;to&#8208;biology&#8217; (D2B) screening of cysteine&#8208;targeting chloroacetamide RFs, wherein synthesis is performed in 384&#8208;well plates allowing direct assessment in downstream biological assays without purification. Here, the developed platform was used to optimise inhibitors of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease (MPro), an established drug target for the treatment of COVID&#8208;19. An initial RF hit was developed into a series of potent inhibitors, and further exploration using D2B screening enabled a &#8216;switch&#8217; to a reversible inhibitor series. This example of ligand discovery for MPro illustrates the acceleration that D2B chemistry can offer for optimising RFs towards covalent inhibitor candidates, as well as providing future impetus to explore the evolution of RFs into non&#8208;covalent ligands.

         <title>Atomic Infusion Induced Reconstruction Enhances Multifunctional Thermally Conductive Films for Robust Low&#8208;Frequency Electromagnetic Absorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gradient carbon infusion strategy for atoms reconstruction is proposed to optimize phase composition of electromagnetic (EM) materials. Enhanced abilities from abundant heterointerfaces and magnetic coupling, the FWC&#8208;O@C/ANFs composite film exhibited impressive performance in low&#8208;frequency EM absorption and thermal conductivity, where coefficient bandwidth surpasses the entire C&#8208;band and thermal conductivity beyond 2500% of the pure ANFs.







Abstract
Deterministic fabrication of highly thermally conductive composite film with satisfying low&#8208;frequency electromagnetic (EM) absorption performance exhibits great potential in advancing the application of 5G smart electric devices but persists challenge. Herein, a multifunctional flexible film combined with hetero&#8208;structured Fe6W6C&#8208;FeWO4@C (FWC&#8722;O@C) as the absorber and aramid nanofibers (ANFs) as the matrix was prepared. Driven by an atomic gradient infusion reduction strategy, the carbon atoms of absorbers can be precisely relocated from carbon shell to core oxometallate lattice, triggering in situ carbothermic reduction for customization of unique oxometallate&#8208;carbide heterojunctions and surface geometrical structure. Such an atoms reconstruction process effectively regulates interface electronic structure and magnetic configuration, resulting in enhanced polarization loss from abundant heterointerfaces and crystal defects and magnetic loss from hierarchical structure endowed magnetic coupling interaction, which jointly contributes to the efficient low&#8208;frequency EM absorption performance. Eventually, optimized FWC&#8722;O@C microplate exhibits a broad absorption bandwidth surpassed the entire C band, and the assembled FWC&#8722;O@C/ANFs composite film also performs a high thermal conductivity over 2500&#8201;% higher than that of the pure ANFs. These findings provide a new insight into the atomic reconstruction affected EM properties and a generalized methodological guidance for preparing multifunctional thermally conductive composite films.

         <title>Scalable, High&#8208;Yield Monolayer MXene Preparation from Multilayer MXene for Many Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;temperature ultrasonic exfoliation can effectively weaken the hydrogen&#8208;bond cage confinement between the oxygen&#8208;containing terminal groups of multilayer MXene and surrounding water molecules, significantly increasing the yield of monolayer MXene and challenging traditional methods of its preparation. This method achieves a high&#8208;quality monolayer MXene yield of up to 95&#8201;%, effectively overcoming key scientific and technical bottlenecks in transitioning MXene from laboratory research to industrial applications.







Abstract
MXene (Ti3C2Tx) is renowned for its exceptional conductivity and hydrophilicity; however, the low yield of monolayers hinders its industrial scalability. Herein, we present a strategy to substantially enhance the monolayer yield by disrupting the hydrogen&#8208;bonding cage confinement of multilayer MXene using high&#8208;temperature ultrasound, challenging the conventional belief that monolayer MXene can only be prepared at lower temperatures. At approximately 70&#8201;&#176;C, the weakened hydrogen bonding between the oxygen&#8208;containing terminal groups of multilayer MXene and surrounding water molecules weakens the hydrogen&#8208;bond cage confinement. This enables ultrasonic cavitation to generate more microbubbles that penetrate the interlayers of multilayer MXene, resulting in gentle and thorough delamination into larger monolayer nanosheets. Achieving up to a 95&#8201;% yield in just tens of minutes, these nanosheets exhibit properties comparable to those produced by traditional ice&#8208;bath methods. Furthermore, the high&#8208;concentration MXene ink produced on a large scale using this high&#8208;yield approach exhibits excellent printing and processing capabilities, and the corresponding products showcase superior infrared stealth and Joule heating characteristics. This work addresses a key technical bottleneck in MXene production, paving the way for its extensive technological and industrial applications.

         <title>Local Structure&#8208;Induced Selective Interactions Enables High&#8208;Performance and Burn&#8208;in&#8208;Free Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new dimeric acceptors were developed via tailoring the lateral local structures. We found the dimer having stronger self&#8208;interactions would mitigate its interactions with host acceptor, therefore alleviating the kinetic diffusion and excessive aggregation of total acceptors. An impressive efficiency of 20.1&#8201;% is thus achieved with a negligible burn&#8208;in loss.







Abstract
Oligomeric acceptors (OAs) have attracted considerable attention in the organic photovoltaics (OPV) field owing to their capacity in balancing the merits from both monomeric and polymeric acceptors. A delicate control over the distortion between blocks of OAs usually determines the performance and stability of relevant OPV devices. However, it imposes great complexity to realize a controllable degree of distortion by tuning the skeleton of blocks and the position of linker between blocks. Herein, we developed a facile strategy to rationally control the geometry distortion of OAs via a straightforward substitution of alkoxy side&#8208;chains on their blocks. This helps elucidate the integrated influences of molecular distortion and non&#8208;bonded contacts on the selective interactions between OA molecules and between OA and host acceptor in ternary blend. We demonstrate the alkoxy&#8208;OA molecules having stronger self&#8208;interactions would mitigate their interactions with host acceptor, therefore alleviating the kinetic diffusion and excessive aggregation of total acceptors. Combining with a composite&#8208;interlayer strategy by introducing a phenyl&#8208;substituted self&#8208;assembled monolayer to enhance the doping with polyoxometalate, an impressive efficiency of 20.1&#8201;% is achieved accompanied by a negligible burn&#8208;in loss against physical aging.

&lt;p&gt;Two new dimeric acceptors were developed via tailoring the lateral local structures. We found the dimer having stronger self-interactions would mitigate its interactions with host acceptor, therefore alleviating the kinetic diffusion and excessive aggregation of total acceptors. An impressive efficiency of 20.1&#8201;% is thus achieved with a negligible burn-in loss.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oligomeric acceptors (OAs) have attracted considerable attention in the organic photovoltaics (OPV) field owing to their capacity in balancing the merits from both monomeric and polymeric acceptors. A delicate control over the distortion between blocks of OAs usually determines the performance and stability of relevant OPV devices. However, it imposes great complexity to realize a controllable degree of distortion by tuning the skeleton of blocks and the position of linker between blocks. Herein, we developed a facile strategy to rationally control the geometry distortion of OAs via a straightforward substitution of alkoxy side-chains on their blocks. This helps elucidate the integrated influences of molecular distortion and non-bonded contacts on the selective interactions between OA molecules and between OA and host acceptor in ternary blend. We demonstrate the alkoxy-OA molecules having stronger self-interactions would mitigate their interactions with host acceptor, therefore alleviating the kinetic diffusion and excessive aggregation of total acceptors. Combining with a composite-interlayer strategy by introducing a phenyl-substituted self-assembled monolayer to enhance the doping with polyoxometalate, an impressive efficiency of 20.1&#8201;% is achieved accompanied by a negligible burn-in loss against physical aging. This study demonstrates the validation of tuning of selective interactions towards high-performance and burn-in-free OPV.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Deep Neural Network Enhanced Mesoscopic Thermodynamic Model for Unlocking the Electrode/Electrolyte Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mesoscopic thermodynamic model was performed to bridge the microscopic characteristics of ions and macroscopic effects of external field based on the chemical potential. A deep neural network enhanced mesoscopic thermodynamic model was developed to calculate ion density distributions at the electrode/electrolyte interface over complex conditions, which improves the efficiency and accuracy of the prediction for interface properties.







Abstract
Structure and properties of the electrode/electrolyte interface significantly influence the electrochemical processes of energy storage and conversion, yet the challenge lies in accurate description of both molecular characteristics and external field effects. Here, we develop a mesoscopic thermodynamic model that calculates the thermodynamic properties of electrolytes based on chemical potential, and its efficiency is enhanced by a deep neural network. The deep neural network enhanced mesoscopic thermodynamic (DeepMT) model effectively bridges the gap between micro&#8208;level characteristics of ions and macro&#8208;level effects of external field, enabling precise presentation of ion density distributions over complex conditions. Our result indicates that the DeepMT model not only demonstrates a computational efficiency improvement of approximately four orders of magnitude over direct theoretical calculations, but also accurately predicts interface properties including ion adsorption, surface charge, and differential capacitance through the statistical analysis of density distributions.

Abstract
The discovery of efficient and stable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic conditions is crucial for the commercialization of proton&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolyzers. In this work, we propose a Sr(OH)2&#8208;assisted method to fabricate a (200) facet highly exposed strontium&#8208;doped IrOx catalyst to provide available adjacent iridium sites with lower Ir&#8722;O covalency. This design facilitates direct O&#8722;O coupling during the acidic water oxidation process, thereby circumventing the high energy barrier associated with the generation of *OOH intermediates. Benefiting from this advantage, the resulting Sr&#8722;IrOx catalyst exhibits an impressive overpotential of 207&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4. Furthermore, a PEMWE device utilizing Sr&#8722;IrOx as the anodic catalyst demonstrates a cell voltage of 1.72&#8197;V at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and maintains excellent stability for over 500&#8197;hours. Our work not only provides guidance for the design of improved acidic OER catalysts but also encourages the development of iridium&#8208;based electrocatalysts with novel mechanisms for other electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Polyoxometalate Confined Synthesis of BiVO4 Nanocluster for Urea Production with Remarkable O2/N2 Tolerance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyoxometalate constrained strategy was proposed to prepare ultrafine BiVO4 nanoclusters by premixing [V10O28]6&#8722; into NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;101&#8208;Al (MIL) framework. The obtained BiVO4@MIL&#8208;n can effectively drive the co&#8208;reduction of NO3&#8722; and CO2 in the presence of O2/Ar/N2 to achieve a record urea yield in the mixed atmosphere.







Abstract
Urea electrosynthesis from flue gas and NO3&#8722; under operating conditions represents a promising alternative technology to traditional energy&#8208;intensive industrial process. Herein, we explore a polyoxometalate confined synthesis strategy to prepare ultrafine BiVO4 nanocluster by pre&#8208;incorporating [V10O28]6&#8722; into NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;101&#8208;Al (MIL) framework. The resulting BiVO4@MIL&#8208;n can efficiently drive co&#8208;reduction of NO3&#8722; and CO2 to urea. A record urea yield of 63.4&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1 gcat&#8722;1 was achieved under CO2/O2 mixed gases (33&#8201;% O2) atmosphere, and comparable performance can be obtained by feeding flue gas, demonstrating remarkable O2/N2 tolerance and potential feasibility for urea production under operating conditions. Systematic investigations revealed that MIL carrier with &#8208;NH2 group can enrich CO2, and BiVO4 nanocluster can reduce both NO3&#8722; and CO2 to ensure efficient urea synthesis even in the presence of O2. This work demonstrates the key role of in situ growth of BiVO4 nanocluster within a NH2&#8208;framework in facilitating urea electrosynthesis with exceptional tolerance to O2/N2.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Selective Zeolites for Tandem CO2 Hydrogenation&#8208;Carbonylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zeolite&#8208;based compartmentalized approach for one&#8208;step carbonylation reactions with CO2 is developed. We show that zeolite shape&#8208;selectivity is key to impede unwanted hydrogenation of olefinic substrates and that our catalytic tandem concept enables an equilibrium shift of the low temperature reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction, ultimately resulting in the efficient formation of aldehydes, esters and amides.







Abstract
The valorization of carbon dioxide as a C1 building block in C&#8722;C bond forming reactions is a critical link on the road to carbon&#8208;circular chemistry. Activation of this inert molecule through reduction with H2 to carbon monoxide in the reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction can be followed by a wide spectrum of consecutive carbonylation reactions, but the RWGS is severely equilibrium limited at the moderate temperatures of carbonylations. Here we successfully reconcile both reactions in one pot, while avoiding incompatibilities through a zeolite&#8208;based compartmentalized approach. More specifically, Pt encapsulated in a small&#8208;pore LTA zeolite selectively generates carbon monoxide in mild reaction conditions; an ensuing one&#8208;pot carbonylation reaction allows to shift the equilibrium through continuous consumption of CO. Moreover, the zeolite encapsulation avoids undesired reactions like hydrogenation of the olefin reactant through a molecular sieving effect. This strategy was first studied in&#8208;depth for Rh&#8208;catalyzed olefin hydroformylation with CO2/H2, affording aldehydes in good yields with high regioselectivities. The methodology was then extended to a variety of carbonylations using CO2 for the synthesis of bulk and fine chemicals.

The methodology was then extended to a variety of carbonylations using CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for the synthesis of bulk and fine chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Improving the Blue Color Purity of Tetradentate Pt(II) Complexes with the Assistance of F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H Interaction towards High&#8208;Performance Blue Phosphorescent OLEDs with EQE over 33&#8201;%</title>

Incorporating trifluoromethyl (&#8722;CF3) groups enhances color purity and luminous efficiency in tetradentate Pt(II) complexes through F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H interaction, resulting in blue OLEDs with EQEmax over 33&#8201;% and CIE coordinates of (0.14, 0.14).







Abstract
Among the various challenges in the field of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), simultaneously achieving high efficiency, a long lifespan, and a narrow full&#8208;width at half maximum (FWHM) in blue OLEDs remains a significant hurdle. Herein, we demonstrate a strategy to improve the color purity of tetradentate Pt(II) complexes with the assistance of &#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H interaction by incorporating trifluoromethyl (&#8722;CF3) groups into the well&#8208;known blue tetradentate Pt(II) phosphorescent complex. The results show that the different substitution positions of &#8722;CF3 have significantly varying effects on the FWHM values of the complexes; specifically, introducing &#8722;CF3 on the benzene ring of carbazole effectively reduces the FWHM, while introducing it on the benzene ring linked to the carbene unit has a minimal impact. When utilized in a mixed host system of SiCzCz/SiTrzCz2, the OLEDs with these new complexes as emitters demonstrated maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 27.1&#8201;%, 33.8&#8201;%, and 27.6&#8201;% for PtON&#8208;CF3&#8208;1, PtON&#8208;CF3&#8208;2, and PtON&#8208;2CF3, respectively, with excellent color purity (CIEy&#8776;0.14 for the PtON&#8208;CF3&#8208;2 based device). Notably, the device based on PtON&#8208;CF3&#8208;2 matched the stability of the benchmark PtON&#8208;TBBI complex.This work offers an important guideline for the design of high efficient Pt(II) phosphorescent complexes with good blue color purity.

         <title>A Hypothesis on the Function of High&#8208;Valent Fe in NiFe (Hydr)oxide in the Oxygen&#8208;Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the dynamic changes in NiFe (hydr)oxide and the role of high&#8208;valent Fe in the oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction within alkaline media using in situ techniques. The findings provide insights into the oxidation processes, and show the involvement of bulk and surface Fe4+ species in charge accumulation and catalysis, respectively, offering a novel perspective on optimizing oxygen&#8208; evolution reaction performance.







Abstract
This study investigated the dynamic changes in NiFe (hydr)oxide and identified the role of high&#8208;valent Fe in the oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER) within alkaline media via in situ techniques. Several high&#8208;valent Fe ions were found to remain considerably stable in the absence of potential in NiFe (hydr)oxide, even 96&#8197;hours after the OER. For Ni2+ hydroxide treated with 57Fe ions, where Fe sites are introduced onto the surface of Ni2+ hydroxide, no Fe4+ species were detected at the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS). The findings of this study suggested that the oxidation of bulk Fe ions, similar to Ni ions, to high valent forms, is charge accumulation without a direct role in OER; these results offered a novel perspective on manipulating Fe states to optimize OER efficacy. The prevailing hypothesis suggested that trace amounts of high&#8208;valent Fe ions, notably those on the surface, directly participate in OER.

         <title>Back Cover: Unveiling the influence of oxygen on drug release dynamics in semipermeable polymersomes (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 6/2025)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semipermeable polymersomes, polymeric vesicles that allow selective molecular passage across their membranes, offer a novel platform for controlled drug delivery by leveraging oxygen&#8208;producing enzymatic reactions. In their study (e202419087), Matteo Tollemeto, Jan van Hest et&#8197;al. show how enzymatically generated oxygen modulates the membrane&#8242;s hydrophobicity, altering drug release kinetics. These polymersomes selectively release hydrophobic drugs while retaining hydrophilic ones, showcasing their potential to fine&#8208;tune drug release for improved therapeutic efficacy and patient outcomes.

Perovskite oxide has poor stability in aqueous reactions due to ion leaching. By one&#8208;step reduction, an angstrom&#8208;scale Fe2O3 protective skin decorated with FeNi nanoparticles was in situ grown on the Sr0.9Fe0.81Ta0.09Ni0.1O3&#8208;&#948; surface. The perovskite&#8208;based catalyst with protective skin exhibits excellent activity and outstanding stability in water splitting, as reported by Guangru Zhang, Wanqin Jin et al. in their Research Article (e202417360).

By one-step reduction, an angstrom-scale Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; protective skin decorated with FeNi nanoparticles was in situ grown on the Sr&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.81&lt;/sub&gt;Ta&lt;sub&gt;0.09&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3-&#948;&lt;/sub&gt; surface. The perovskite-based catalyst with protective skin exhibits excellent activity and outstanding stability in water splitting, as reported by Guangru Zhang, Wanqin Jin et al. in their Research Article (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202417360"&gt;e202417360&lt;/a&gt;).

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Combinatorial Metal Complex Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview explores advancements in high&#8208;throughput combinatorial synthesis of metal complexes, emphasising their applications in catalysis, drug discovery, and materials science. We highlight various strategies for metal complex combinatorial chemistry and challenges in scalability and purity assessment. Emerging techniques such as automation and machine learning are outlined for optimising synthesis, evaluation and accelerating the discovery of metal complexes.







Abstract
High&#8208;throughput combinatorial metal complex synthesis has emerged as a powerful tool for rapidly generating and screening diverse libraries of metal complexes, enabling accelerated discovery in fields such as catalysis, medicinal chemistry, and materials science. By systematically combining building blocks under mild and efficient conditions, researchers can explore broad chemical spaces, increasing the likelihood of identifying complexes with desired properties. This method streamlines hit identification and optimisation, especially when integrated with high&#8208;throughput screening and data&#8208;driven approaches like machine learning. Despite challenges such as scalability and purity control, recent advancements in automation and predictive modelling are enhancing the efficiency of combinatorial synthesis, opening new avenues for the development of metal&#8208;based catalysts, therapeutic agents, and functional materials.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Photochemical Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) show merits in light harvesting, charge transfer, mass transport and abundant active sites, which enable them to act as favorable platforms to achieve efficient photochemical transformations, especially H2 evolution, CO2 reduction, and O2 reduction. The challenges and opportunities for extending 2D c&#8208;MOFs towards other photochemical applications are also presented.







Abstract
Photochemical transformation represents an attractive pathway for the conversion of earth&#8208;abundant resources, such as H2O, CO2, O2, and N2, into valuable chemicals by utilizing sunlight as an energy source. Recently, two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) have emerged as the focal points in the field of photo&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion due to their advantages in light harvesting, electrical conductivity, mass transport, tunable electronic and porous structures, as well as abundant active sites. In this review, we highlight various physical and chemical features of 2D c&#8208;MOFs that can contribute to enhanced photo&#8208;induced exciton generation, charge transport, proton migration and redox catalysis. Then, the existing strategies to integrate suitable light absorbers and/or co&#8208;catalysts onto 2D c&#8208;MOFs for photochemical transformations (with a particular focus on H2 evolution, CO2 reduction and O2 reduction) have been discussed. Finally, the challenges and opportunities of using 2D c&#8208;MOFs in other photochemical applications (e.g., N2 fixation, organic synthesis, and environmental remediation) are assessed.

         <dc:description>
With the rapid growth of computer processing power, the computer played an increasingly important role in structure and property predictions, synthesis route optimization, knowledge discovery, generative inverse design, and computer&#8208;aided &#8220;top&#8208;down&#8221; routes brought unprecedented opportunities for the efficient exploration of new DUV, UV, and IR NLO materials with targeted properties.







Abstract
Exploring new nonlinear optical (NLO) materials is an urgent need for advanced photoelectric technologies. However, the discovery of new materials with targeted properties is time&#8208;consuming, and involves various challenges by the traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error experiments. Recently, the theoretical prediction&#8208;guided structural design has been demonstrated as a feasible way for efficiently developing new NLO materials, and a large number of NLO candidates with excellent optical properties have been explored. To promote the development of high&#8208;performance NLO materials, this review provides a summary on the exploration of new NLO materials aided by computer, with a particular emphasis on the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art research advances that including crystal structure predictions, optical &amp; thermal property calculations, high&#8208;throughput screening of NLO materials with or without machine learning; and the progress achieved in the computer&#8208;assisted design and development of new deep ultraviolet (DUV), ultraviolet (UV), infrared (IR) NLO materials in various material systems: oxide, chalcogenide, nitride, and halide. Finally, the opportunities and forthcoming challenges in the fascinating field are discussed.

         <title>Low&#8208;Dimensional Lead&#8208;Free Metal Halides for Efficient Electrically Driven Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;dimensional lead&#8208;free metal halides exhibit lower toxicity and higher thermal stability compared to lead&#8208;based perovskites. An increasing number of metal halides (e.g., Sn, Cu, Mn, Sb, Ln) are being applied in electroluminescent devices, with device performance steadily improving through molecular structure tuning and optimization of device fabrication processes.







Abstract
Electrically driven light&#8208;emitting diodes (ED LEDs) based on 3D metal halide perovskites have seen remarkable advancements during the past decade. However, the highest&#8208;performing devices are largely based on lead&#8208;containing 3D perovskites, presenting two key challenges &#8211; toxicity and stability &#8211; that must be addressed for commercialization. Reducing structural dimensionality and incorporating non&#8208;lead metals present promising pathways to address these issues. Although research on ED LEDs based on low&#8208;dimensional, lead&#8208;free metal halides (LD LFMHs) is growing, their performance still significantly lags behind that of 3D lead halide perovskites. This review seeks to deliver a comprehensive overview of ED LEDs based on LD LFMHs, covering a brief history of their development, methods for material synthesis, luminescence mechanisms, and applications in electroluminescent devices. It also examines current challenges and proposes practical strategies to enhance device performance, with the goal of inspiring further progress in the field.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts on C3N4: Minimizing Single Atom Pt Loading for Maximized Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt single atoms are successfully anchored onto C3N4 through a reactive deposition approach, achieving optimal positioning of Pt atoms in the most stable and active configurations. This strategy results in maximized photocatalytic H2 production efficiency at a low Pt loading of approximately 0.03&#8197;wt&#8201;%.







Abstract
The use of metal single atoms (SAs) as co&#8208;catalysts on semiconductors has emerged as a promising technology to enhance their photocatalytic hydrogen production performance. In this study, we describe the deposition of very low amounts of Pt SAs (&lt;0.1&#8201;at&#8201;%) on exfoliated graphitic carbon nitride (C3N4) by a direct Pt&#8722;deposition approach from highly dilute chloroplatinic acid precursors. We find that &#8722; using this technique&#8722;a remarkably low loading of highly dispersed Pt SAs (0.03&#8197;wt&#8201;%) on C3N4 is sufficient to achieve a drastic decrease in the overall charge transfer resistance and a maximized photocatalytic efficiency. The resulting low&#8208;loaded Pt SAs/C3N4 provides a H2 production rate of 1.66&#8197;m&#8201;mol/h/mg&#8197;Pt, with a remarkable stability against agglomeration; even during prolonged photocatalytic reactions no sign of light&#8208;induced Pt agglomerations can be observed. We ascribe the high performance and stability to the site&#8208;selective, stable coordination of Pt within the C3N4 structure. Notably the H2 production rate of the low&#8208;loaded Pt SAs surpasses the activity of Pt SAs deposited by other techniques or nanoparticles at comparable or even higher loading &#8211; the optimized Pt SAs decorated C3N4 show &#8776;5.9 times higher rate than Pt NP decorated C3N4.

         <title>Photoredox/Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Chemo&#8208;, Regio&#8208;, Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Reductive Coupling of 1,1&#8208;Disubstituted Allenes and Cyclobutenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new protocol for highly chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective reductive coupling of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenes and cyclobutenes promoted by a readily available cobalt&#8208;based catalyst was developed. This process represents the first example of enantioselective reductive coupling of allenes with nonpolar alkenes through oxidative cyclization pathway, enabling enantioselective incorporation of a broad scope of alkenyls into cyclobutanes.







Abstract
A dual photoredox/cobalt&#8208;catalyzed protocol for chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective reductive coupling of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenes and cyclobutenes through chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective oxidative cyclization followed by stereoselective protonation promoted by a chiral phosphine&#8211;cobalt complex is presented. Such process represents an unprecedented reaction pathway for cobalt catalysis that enables selective transformation of the less sterically congested alkenes of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenes with cyclobutenes, incorporating a broad scope of tetrasubstituted alkenes into the cyclobutane scaffolds in up to 86&#8201;% yield, &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2 chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2 dr and &gt;99.5:0.5 er. Functionalization delivered a variety of enantioenriched cyclobutanes that are otherwise difficult to access. Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed that the reactions proceeded through oxidative cyclization followed by protonation and protonation might be the rate&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Azadihomocorannulene as a Heptagon&#8208;Embedded Diradicaloid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azadihomocorannulene dication and diradicaloid molecules were synthesized by mechanochemical C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H coupling as a key reaction. Their structures and physiochemical properties were investigated experimentally and theoretically.







Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic diradical(oid) molecules are attracting significant attention because of their unique electronic and magnetic properties as well as their applications as functional materials. While diradical(oid) molecules bearing five&#8208;membered rings have been extensively investigated, those bearing seven&#8208;membered rings are relatively fewer. Herein, we report the synthesis of azapentabenzodihomocorannulene dication and diradical molecules. The synthesis was achieved through a mechanochemical C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H coupling in the presence of sodium as a key reaction. Electron spin resonance studies revealed that the neutral azapentabenzodihomocorannulene adopts a singlet diradical (diradicaloid) ground state with a small singlet&#8722;triplet energy gap of 2.1&#8197;kcal/mol. The electronic and optical properties were investigated both experimentally and theoretically to elucidate their aromatic character.

While diradical(oid) molecules bearing five-membered rings have been extensively investigated, those bearing seven-membered rings are relatively fewer. Herein, we report the synthesis of azapentabenzodihomocorannulene dication and diradical molecules. The synthesis was achieved through a mechanochemical C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H/C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H coupling in the presence of sodium as a key reaction. Electron spin resonance studies revealed that the neutral azapentabenzodihomocorannulene adopts a singlet diradical (diradicaloid) ground state with a small singlet&#8722;triplet energy gap of 2.1&#8197;kcal/mol. The electronic and optical properties were investigated both experimentally and theoretically to elucidate their aromatic character.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Dehydroprolines by an Energy&#8208;Transfer Enabled Cloke&#8208;Wilson Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic Cloke&#8208;Wilson rearrangement of crude aminocyclopropane carboxylate (ACPC) imines is reported. This leverages an energy&#8208;transfer mechanism transforming the core of ACPC to value added dehydroprolines&#8212;a useful synthetic intermediate en route to the synthesis of substituted unnatural proline derivatives. Both the 1,5&#8208;dehydroproline, as well as the uncommon 1,2&#8208;isomer are obtained from the same starting material under slightly modified conditions.







Abstract
A one&#8208;pot photocatalytic method is reported for the generation of dehydroprolines, valuable precursors to 5&#8208;aryl prolines. Imines, obtained via simple condensation of aminocyclopropane carboxylates (ACPC) with a broad range of aldehydes, were employed in this transformation without purification. We demonstrate this energy&#8208;transfer (EnT) enabled Cloke&#8208;Wilson&#8208;type rearrangement affords both the rare 1,2&#8208;dehydroprolines or the more thermodynamically favored 1,5&#8208;isomers with up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 selectivity in both directions, using an identical catalytic system from the same starting material. Syntheses of intermediates of bioactive molecules in high yields and selectivity highlight this enabling transformation. Mechanistic studies support the proposed triplet&#8208;triplet EnT mode of activation, distinct from the previously developed singlet excited states accessed via UV excitation.

         <title>Germylene Mediated Reductive C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N Coupling of an Isocyanide and its Device Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reductive coupling of perimidine based N&#8208;heterocyclic germylene and 4&#8208;iodophenyl isocyanide afforded a highly colored and luminescent bis&#8208;spirogerma species with unprecedented simultaneous C&#8722;N and C&#8722;C coupling. The compound is also successfully integrated as a hole transport material in a solar cell.







Abstract
We have demonstrated a unique reductive coupling of 4&#8208;iodophenyl isocyanide, facilitated by a perimidine&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic germylene (NHGe), which yields a bis&#8208;spirogerma compound featuring simultaneous C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond formation. This reaction, which leads to the oxidation of germanium from +2 to +4, represents a significant departure from previously documented isocyanide&#8208;germylene interactions. The product exhibits extensive conjugation across its bicyclic C4Ge2N2 framework, conferring distinct photophysical properties, including prominent orange luminescence in both solution and solid states. The photophysical properties are supported by the TD&#8208;DFT calculations confirming an n&#8594;&#960;* transition. The potential application of this compound in optoelectronic devices, particularly as a hole transport layer in PbS quantum dot solar cells, is also explored, with promising preliminary results.

         <title>Boosting Adsorption and Selectivity of Acetylene by Nitro Functionalisation in Copper(II)&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isostructural MOF materials, MFM&#8208;190(R) (R=&#8722;F, &#8722;CH3, &#8722;NO2) exhibit exceptional acetylene (C2H2) adsorption and selectivity. MFM&#8208;190(NO2) shows a high C2H2 uptake of 216&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1 bar, 298&#8197;K and excellent C2H2/CO2 selectivity (up to ~150 for v/v = 2/1). Dynamic breakthrough experiments confirm efficient separation under ambient conditions, supported by in situ neutron powder diffraction studies revealing cooperative binding of C2H2 at unsaturated Cu(II) and &#8722;NO2 sites.







Abstract
Purification and storage of acetylene (C2H2) are important to many industrial processes. The exploitation of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) materials to address the balance between selectivity for C2H2 vs carbon dioxide (CO2) against maximising uptake of C2H2 has attracted much interest. Herein, we report that the synergy between unsaturated Cu(II) sites and functional groups, fluoro (&#8722;F), methyl (&#8722;CH3), nitro (&#8722;NO2) in a series of isostructural MOF materials MFM&#8208;190(R) that show exceptional adsorption and selectivity of C2H2. At 298&#8197;K, MFM&#8208;190(NO2) exhibits an C2H2 uptake of 216&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 (320&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 273&#8197;K) at 1.0&#8197;bar and a high selectivity for C2H2/CO2 (up to ~150 for v/v = 2/1) relevant to that in the industrial cracking stream. Dynamic breakthrough studies validate and confirm the excellent separation of C2H2/CO2 by MFM&#8208;190(NO2) under ambient conditions. In situ neutron powder diffraction reveals the cooperative binding, packing and selectivity of C2H2 by unsaturated Cu(II) sites and free &#8722;NO2 groups.

         <title>Oxenoid Reactivity Enabled by Targeted Photoactivation of Periodate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The targeted photoactivation of periodate provides a novel and operationally straightforward method for accessing oxenoid&#8208;type reactivity. Computational studies have revealed a geometric transition in periodate geometry which, when irradiated, allows for the facile extrusion of molecular oxygen. This new reaction pathway allows for the epoxidation of a broad range of olefin substrates using an organic&#8208;soluble source of periodate and violet light irradiation.







Abstract
The chemistry of low&#8208;valent intermediates continues to inspire new modes of reactivity across synthetic chemistry. But while the generation and reactivity of both carbenes and nitrenes are well&#8208;established, difficulties in accessing oxene, their oxygen&#8208;based congener, has severely hampered its application in synthesis. Here, we report a conceptually novel approach towards oxenoid reactivity through the violet&#8208;light photolysis of tetrabutylammonium periodate. Computational studies reveal an unexpected geometric change upon periodate photoexcitation that facilitates intersystem crossing and near&#8208;barrierless dissociation of triplet periodate into oxene. Under these operationally simple conditions, we have demonstrated the epoxidation of a wide range of substituted olefins, revealing unprecedented functional group compatibility. By overcoming the historic challenges associated with employing oxene as an intermediate in organic chemistry, we believe that this platform will inspire the development of new reactive oxygen&#8208;based methodologies across industry and academia.

         <title>Integrated Catalyst ZnNC&#8834;PtZn for High&#8208;Performance Ethanol Electrooxidation and DEFC</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integrated catalyst ZnNC&#8834;PtZn/C, containing reactive centers of Zn&#8208;NxC nest&#8208; enclosed intermetallic compound of PtZn NPs, achieves a remarkable performance for ethanol electrooxidation with a mass activity of 3.7&#8197;A&#8197;mgPt&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 78.2&#8201;%, following the C1 pathway and the retention of initial activity remains 97&#8201;% after 5,000&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
We report here an electrocatalyst that exhibits superior performance in the electrooxidation of ethanol. The reactive centers of the catalyst have a nest&#8208;type configuration with outer Zn&#8208;NxC nest covering inner PtZn intermetallic compound nanoparticles loaded on carbon support (ZnNC&#8834;PtZn/C). The high&#8208;energy stepped facets of the inner PtZn nanoparticles confined and shaped by the outer Zn&#8208;NxC nest is highly active for the critical C&#8722;C bond cleavage of ethanol in oxidation, confirmed by experimental characterizations and density functional theory calculations. The catalyst shows a rare high&#8208;performance and demonstrates a mass activity of 3.7&#8197;A&#8197;mgPt&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 78.2&#8201;%, following the C1 pathway of reaction and the retention of initial activity remains 97&#8201;% after 5,000&#8197;cycles. The unique configuration, also mitigating the concentration polarization, endows the catalyst with innate ethanol electrooxidation property by inner&#8208;outer synergic interactions, leading to unexpected power output of an acidic direct ethanol fuel cell.

         <title>High Charge Carrier Mobility in Porphyrin Nanoribbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;resolved terahertz (THz) spectroscopy experiments show that charge carriers, generated by an optical pulse (h&#957;), on a &#960;&#8208;conjugated porphyrin nanoribbon are exceptionally mobile. The porphyrin nanoribbons are polydisperse polymers synthesized by nickel(0)&#8208;mediated Yamamoto coupling followed by oxidative planarization, and have an average degree of polymerization of up to 37 repeat units (length 31&#8197;nm).







Abstract
Polydisperse edge&#8208;fused nickel(II) porphyrin nanoribbons have been synthesized by Yamamoto coupling followed by gold(III)&#8208;mediated fusion, with average degrees of polymerization of up to 37 repeat units (length 31&#8197;nm). Time&#8208;resolved optical&#8208;pump terahertz spectroscopy measurements indicate that photo&#8208;generated charge carriers have dc mobilities of up to 205&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in these nanoribbons, exceeding the values previously reported for most other types of nanoribbon or &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer.

         <title>Spontaneously Blinkogenic Probe for Wash&#8208;Free Single&#8208;Molecule Localization&#8208;Based Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a novel blinkogenic probe HM&#8208;DS655&#8208;Halo that remains non&#8208;blinking until it binds to HaloTag, thereby initiating its spontaneous blinking activity and facilitating its use in live cell SMLM imaging without wash&#8208;out steps. HM&#8208;DS655&#8208;Halo is successfully employed in imaging various intracellular structures at the nanoscale, including mitochondrial fission and contact, cell migration, and pseudopod growth.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule localization super&#8208;resolution fluorescence imaging relies on the fluorescence ON/OFF switching of fluorescent probes to break the diffraction limit. However, the unreacted or nonspecifically bound probes cause non&#8208;targeted ON/OFF switching, resulting in substantial fluorescence background that significantly reduces localization precision and accuracy. Here, we report a blinkogenic probe HM&#8208;DS655&#8208;Halo that remains blinking OFF until it binds to HaloTag, thereby triggering its self&#8208;blinking activity and enabling its application in direct SMLM imaging in living cells without wash&#8208;out steps. We employed the ratio of the duty cycle before and after self&#8208;blinking activation, termed as the parameter &#8220;RDC&#8221; to characterize blinkogenicity. The covalent binding to HaloTag induces HM&#8208;DS655&#8208;Halo to transition from a fluorescent OFF state to a fluorescence blinking state. This transition also leads to a change in the RDC value, which is calculated to be 12, ensuring super blinkogenicity to effectively suppress background signals in living cells. HM&#8208;DS655&#8208;Halo was successfully applied in dynamic SMLM imaging of diverse intracellular sub&#8208;structures with minimal background noise, including mitochondrial fission and contact, cell migration, and pseudopod growth.

         <title>Dynamically Switchable Global Chirality in Racemic Polymer Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two diametrically opposed chiral conflict effects (&#8220;first come, first served&#8221; effect and &#8220;late&#8208;comer lives above&#8221; effect) were found in the construction of global chirality, racemic copolymers that originally thought to be optically inactive can exhibit tunable and multiple chiroptical activity in this system without any external asymmetrical intervention.







Abstract
Any polymers composed of racemic segments are obviously optically inactive and lack any chiroptical applications. Here, we present an intriguing method for precisely generating global chirality in racemic copolymer assemblies without any external asymmetrical intervention via step&#8208;wise polymerization&#8208;induced chiral self&#8208;assembly (PICSA). Global supramolecular chirality of the nanoaggregates could be dynamically switched by the two diametrically opposed chiral conflict effects: &#8220;first come, first serve&#8221; effect and &#8220;late&#8208;comer lives above&#8221; effect, which can be controlled by the precisely specified the number and sequence of enantiomeric segments. Significantly, the supramolecular stacking manners of the racemic mesogenic building units as well as the liquid crystallinity of the solvophobic core play a crucial role for the chiral communication pathway of enantiomeric mesogens. Furthermore, such switchable global chirality in racemic polymers is broadly applicable and well regulable. We propose that this research may challenge the notion that racemic systems lack optical activity while highlighting their potential applications in functional racemic polymer materials and providing insights into the evolution of racemates towards homochirality on early Earth.

         <title>Glycopolymer&#8208;Mediated Selective Separation of Middle Rare Earth Elements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;inspired, stimuli&#8208;responsive glucuronate&#8208;functionalized polymers selectively separate middle rare earth elements (MREEs), such as Samarium, over Holmium and Cerium, through tailored charge density and polymer length. Acidification triggers glucuronate protonation, releasing the MREEs and resolubilizing the polymer. The material's efficiency in separating MREEs from complex mixtures is showcased, offering a reusable, size&#8208;selective strategy for addressing challenges in MREE recovery.







Abstract
The selective separation of rare earth elements (REEs) remains a formidable challenge due to limitations of current methodologies, which struggle to achieve the separation efficiency required for their critical industrial applications. Middle REEs (MREEs), characterized by their intermediate ionic radii, are particularly challenging to separate without size&#8208;specific trapping mechanisms. In this study, we report a novel approach that synergistically combines heavy metal sequestration with size&#8208;selective separation, utilizing negatively charged glycopolymers to achieve the targeted separation of MREEs. We systematically investigated the binding affinities of these glycopolymers for various REEs, focusing on the selective isolation of MREEs through a controlled variation of glycopolymer properties, including degree of polymerization (DP) and charge density.

     alt="Glycopolymer-Mediated Selective Separation of Middle Rare Earth Elements"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bio-inspired, stimuli-responsive glucuronate-functionalized polymers selectively separate middle rare earth elements (MREEs), such as Samarium, over Holmium and Cerium, through tailored charge density and polymer length. Acidification triggers glucuronate protonation, releasing the MREEs and resolubilizing the polymer. The material's efficiency in separating MREEs from complex mixtures is showcased, offering a reusable, size-selective strategy for addressing challenges in MREE recovery.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The selective separation of rare earth elements (REEs) remains a formidable challenge due to limitations of current methodologies, which struggle to achieve the separation efficiency required for their critical industrial applications. Middle REEs (MREEs), characterized by their intermediate ionic radii, are particularly challenging to separate without size-specific trapping mechanisms. In this study, we report a novel approach that synergistically combines heavy metal sequestration with size-selective separation, utilizing negatively charged glycopolymers to achieve the targeted separation of MREEs. We systematically investigated the binding affinities of these glycopolymers for various REEs, focusing on the selective isolation of MREEs through a controlled variation of glycopolymer properties, including degree of polymerization (DP) and charge density. Our findings reveal a distinctive U-shaped selectivity profile, with a marked preference for Samarium (Sm) and Europium (Eu) over other REEs such as Cerium (Ce), Gadolinium (Gd), and Holmium (Ho). This selectivity underscores the potential for designing tailored separation processes optimized for specific MREEs. Moreover, enrichment experiments demonstrated the practical viability of our methodology, achieving over 10&#8201;% selectivity for Sm in a Ce/Sm mixture with a 10&#8201;:&#8201;1 Ce/Sm ratio, a trend that held for Sm in a Ho/Sm Mixture with a 10&#8201;:&#8201;1 Ho/Sm ratio, indicating significant selectivity over both light and heavy REEs. A subsequent separation experiment using a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 Ce/Sm mixture yielded a 15&#8201;% enrichment after only five passes through a filter containing minimal amounts of glycopolymer, highlighting the promise of further refinement for enhanced separation efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Abnormal Freezing Effect on Electron Conduction of Ball&#8208;milled Lanthanum Trihydride for Superionic Conductor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
At low temperatures, lattice deformation has a noticeable influence on the interaction of octahedral hydrogen and tetrahedral hydrogen in the ball&#8208;milled LaHx, which plays a crucial role in hindering electron conduction, thus improving the ionic transfer number significantly.







Abstract
A recent finding shows that lattice deformation could transform the mixed electronic/hydride (H&#8722;) conducting lanthanum trihydride (LaH3) to a superionic H&#8722; conductor. Such a feature would enable the development of a brand&#8208;new all&#8208;solid&#8208;state hydride ion battery. It is essential to elucidate the mechanism of such a phenomenon. Here, we disclose an abnormal freezing effect on the electronic conductivity (&#963;e) of the ball&#8208;milled LaH3; that is, &#963;e can be lowered by over 2 orders of magnitude upon a low&#8208;temperature treatment. Low&#8208;temperature Raman reveals that at low temperatures, lattice deformation has a noticeable influence on the interaction of hydrogen at octahedral (Ho) and tetrahedral (Ht) sites, which may play a crucial role in hindering electron conduction. This freezing effect can significantly improve the ionic transfer number of rare earth&#8208;based H&#8722; conductors and provide a new direction to the development of solid electrolytes for low&#8208;temperature all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Benzyl Ammonium Carbamates Undergo Two&#8208;Step Linker Cleavage and Improve the Properties of Antibody Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards the goal of identifying an intrinsically polar linker domain, we report that benzyl &#945;&#8208;ammonium carbamates (BAC) undergo a tandem 1,6&#8211;1,2 elimination sequence to release secondary amines. A zwitterionic BAC linker variant is found to improve the labeling and reduce antibody aggregation when compared to a conventional and a cationic BAC linker. Finally, fluorescence imaging studies demonstrate that the model payload is released in antigen&#8208;expressing cells and tumors with high specificity.







Abstract
Targeted payload delivery strategies, such as antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs), have emerged as important therapeutics. Although considerable efforts have been made in the areas of antibody engineering and labeling methodology, improving the overall physicochemical properties of the linker/payload combination remains an important challenge. Here we report an approach to create an intrinsically hydrophilic linker domain. We find that benzyl &#945;&#8208;ammonium carbamates (BACs) undergo tandem 1,6&#8211;1,2&#8208;elimination to release secondary amines. Using a fluorogenic hemicyanine as a model payload component, we show that a zwitterionic BAC linker improves labeling efficiency and reduces antibody aggregation when compared to a commonly used para&#8208;amino benzyl (PAB) linker as well as a cationic BAC. Cellular and in vivo fluorescence imaging studies demonstrate that the model payload is specifically released in antigen&#8208;expressing cells and tumors. The therapeutic potential of the BAC linker strategy was assessed using an MMAE payload, a potent microtubule&#8208;disrupting agent frequently used for ADC applications. The BAC&#8208;MMAE combination enhances labeling efficiency and cellular toxicity when compared to the routinely used PAB&#8208;Val&#8208;Cit ADC analogue. Broadly, this strategy provides a general approach to mask payload hydrophobicity and improve the properties of targeted agents.

         <title>Unveiling the influence of oxygen on drug release dynamics in semipermeable polymersomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semipermeable polymersomes, designed for controlled drug delivery, utilize enzymatic oxygen generation to modulate release kinetics. This study highlights enhanced hydrophobic drug release and retention of hydrophilic drugs, emphasizing membrane properties&#8242; pivotal role in optimizing therapeutic efficacy and disease&#8208;specific applications.







Abstract
Semipermeable polymersomes, a class of polymeric vesicles that allow molecular passage across their membranes, offer significant potential for controlled drug delivery. These vesicles can be designed for inherent or selective permeability through the choice of suitable copolymers or the incorporation of protein nanopores, respectively. In this study, we explore a novel approach using oxygen&#8208;producing enzymatic reactions within biodegradable poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;poly(caprolactone&#8208;gradient&#8208;trimethylene carbonate) (PEG&#8208;p(CL&#8208;g&#8208;TMC)) polymersomes to modulate drug release. These polymersomes were found to enhance the release of hydrophobic drugs while retaining hydrophilic drugs. The enzymatic generation of oxygen within the polymersomes increased membrane hydrophobicity, influencing drug release kinetics. The findings highlight the importance of understanding drug release kinetics in designing effective drug delivery systems, as the release rate and mechanism critically impact therapeutic efficacy and patient outcomes.

         <title>Electrosynthesis of Mussel&#8208;inspired Adhesive Polymers as a Novel Class of Transient Enzyme Stabilizers</title>

The electrochemical oxidation of multifunctional catechols represents a &#8220;green&#8221; and clean alternative pathway to ortho&#8208;quinones, which are used to form oligomer networks with branched multi&#8208;thiols. In these networks, the catechols are restored and represent adhesive points, which can establish transient interactions with enzymes. These oligomer/enzyme&#8208;conjugates are shielding the enzymes from heat stress, thus preventing denaturation.







Abstract
Multifunctional ortho&#8208;quinones are required for the formation of thiol&#8208;catechol&#8208;connectivities (TCC) but can be delicate to handle. We present the electrochemical oxidation of the dipeptide DiDOPA, achieving up to 92&#8201;% conversion efficiency of the catechols to ortho&#8208;quinones. Graphite and stainless steel could be employed as cost&#8208;efficient electrodes. The electrochemical activation yields quinone&#8208;solutions, which are free of undesired reactive compounds and eliminates the challenging step of isolating the reactive quinones. The DiDOPA quinones were employed in polyaddition reactions with multi&#8208;thiols, forming oligomers that functioned as transient enzyme stabilizers (TES). These TCC&#8208;TES&#8208;additives improved the thermal stability and the activity of tyrosinase in heat stress assays.

         <title>Scrolled Poly(L&#8208;Lactic Acid) Single Crystals via Chain End&#8208;Induced Symmetry&#8208;Breaking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scrolled single crystals of biodegradable poly(L&#8208;lactic acid) with broken translational symmetry were obtained using solution crystallization. The scrolling mechanism was attributed to the imbalance of the fold surfaces arising from the asymmetrical distribution of the polymer chain ends, experimentally confirmed by nanoparticle decoration. This work demonstrates a new strategy for breaking crystal translational symmetry in polymer single crystals.







Abstract
Single crystals that do not obey translational symmetry have been reported in various material systems. In polymers, twisted crystals are typically formed in banded spherulites, while a class of non&#8208;flat polymer single crystals (PSCs) has been observed. Herein, we report the formation of scrolled single crystals of biodegradable polymer poly(L&#8208;lactic acid) (PLLA). While classical 2&#8208;dimensional single crystals formed in solution&#8208;crystallized PLLA are flat, we show that PLLA crystals bend into scrolls when the polymer molecular weight is low. The formation of these unique scrolled PLLA single crystals depends on polymer chain ends and the polymer molecular weight. This work, therefore, demonstrates a new mechanism to break translational symmetry in PSC growth.

         <title>Remote On&#8208;Paper Electrochemiluminescence&#8208;Based High&#8208;Safety and Multilevel Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The far&#8208;surface on&#8208;paper electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is programmed for high&#8208;safety information encryption. Three strategies are proposed and ultimately combined to design a multilevel information encryption system that is protected not only by encoding but also by the unique ECL decoding. Protein modified nanospheres (DPSN/PEI/BSA) and secondary antibody are used as the chemical and biological inks to encode the message on the nitrocellulose (NC) membranes, which can be only decrypted by ECL imaging with the immune reaction key (DPSN/PEI/mAb) and ECL key [tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)ruthenium and voltage].







Abstract
The escalating needs in information protection underscore the urgency of developing advanced encryption strategies. Herein we report a novel chemical approach that enables information encryption by on&#8208;paper electrochemiluminescence (ECL). Dendritic porous silica nanospheres modified with polyetherimide and bovine serum albumin were prepared as the chemical ink to write the secret message on a paper. Attaching the paper to an electrode, immersing it in a solution containing tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)ruthenium (Ru(bpy)32+) and then applying a suitable voltage, a remote &#8220;catalytic route&#8221; electrochemical reaction produces ECL that functions as the key to decrypt and visualize the message by imaging. In addition, proteins can be also used as the biological ink to write the secret message, which is then decrypted by a combined use of immunochemistry and ECL imaging as two keys. We believe the ECL&#8208;based strategy holds great promise in high&#8208;safety and multilevel information encryption, as it is protected not only by encoding, like conventional invisible inks, but also by the unique ECL decoding approach.

         <title>Manipulating p&#8208;&#960; Resonance through Methoxy Group Engineering in Covalent Organic Frameworks for an Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By strategically modulating the position and quantity of &#8722;OMe units, we can precisely manipulate the p&#8208;&#960; conjugation, resulting in enhanced charge carrier kinetics and mitigated mass transfer resistance in COF&#8208;OMe&#8208;3 with para&#8208;dimethoxy substitution. Consequently, these modifications lead to a significant improvement in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction efficiency.







Abstract
Kinetic factors frequently emerge as the primary constraints in photocatalysis, exerting a critical influence on the efficacy of polymeric photocatalysts. The diverse conjugation systems within covalent organic frameworks (COFs) can significantly impact photon absorption, energy level structures, charge separation and migration kinetics. Consequently, these limitations often manifest as unsatisfactory kinetic behavior, which adversely affects the photocatalytic activity of COFs. To address these challenges, we propose a methoxy (&#8722;OMe) molecular engineering strategy designed to enhance charge carrier kinetics and mitigate mass transfer resistance. Through strategic modulation of the position and quantity of &#8722;OMe units, we can effectively manipulate the p&#8208;&#960; conjugation, thereby enhancing charge separation and migration. Moreover, COFs enriched with &#8722;OMe moieties exhibit enhanced mass transfer dynamics due to the hydrophilic nature of methoxy groups, which facilitate the diffusion of reactants and products within the porous structure. This approach is hypothesized to drive an efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction.

         <title>Control of Bilayer Transport through a Photoswitchable Membrane&#8208;Stiffening Agent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lipid bilayer membrane fluidity is altered with a photoswitchable membrane&#8208;stiffening agent based on stiff&#8208;stilbene. The fluidity increase upon E&#8208;to&#8208;Z isomerization is shown to enhance the activity of known synthetic anion transporters due to an increase in mobility. Our work provides a stepping stone towards directed motion and active transport across membranes.







Abstract
The mobility of proteins in the bilayer membrane is affected by (local) changes in lipid environment, which is important to their biological functioning. Artificial molecular systems that&#8212;to some extent&#8212;imitate tasks of membrane&#8208;embedded proteins are increasingly developed, however, they are usually controlled through responsive units in their core structure. Here we present an alternative approach based on an amphiphilic stiff&#8208;stilbene derivative that enables control of membrane fluidity by light. The fluidity increase upon E&#8208;to&#8208;Z isomerization is shown to enhance the activity of known synthetic anion transporters as a result of a higher mobility. The photoisomerization process is studied by UV/Vis and 1H NMR spectroscopy in solution and in POPC vesicles, where the light&#8208;induced changes in fluidity and hence, activity of anion transporters, are monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy. Dynamic light&#8208;scattering (DLS) and cryo&#8208;EM studies show that vesicle integrity is not impaired by photoswitching. Our work introduces a versatile approach to control solute transport by carrier molecules. Moreover, the photocontrol over membrane fluidity and, with that, mobility could eventually be used for directed motion, which we expect to be key in achieving active transport in the future.

         <title>Chiral Metal&#8208;Free Anti&#8208;Perovskite with Strong Chiroptical Nonlinearity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first chiral metal&#8208;free anti&#8208;perovskite is constructed, which exhibits strong nonlinear chiroptical property. The second&#8208;harmonic generation circular dichroism of the chiral metal&#8208;free anti&#8208;perovskite reaches 0.60. Moreover, owing to the outstanding optical transparency of R&#8208;MCN and S&#8208;MCN, they exhibit a high LDT of 71&#8197;mJ/cm2, which is larger than that of most chiral perovskites.







Abstract
The nonlinear chiroptical properties of chiral metal halide perovskite has attracted substantial attention in recent years. In order to overcome the inherent limitations of metal halide, such as high costs, potential toxicity, challenges with recycling, especially the limited laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (LDT), we have successfully constructed the first chiral metal&#8208;free anti&#8208;perovskite, with the aim of utilizing it in second harmonic generation&#8208;circular dichroism (SHG&#8208;CD). Moreover, the anti&#8208;perovskite composed entirely of small organic ions typically display a more extensive transparent window, which could contribute a high LDT. Herein two chiral metal&#8208;free anti&#8208;perovskites, R/S&#8208;MCN [(R/S&#8208;MBA)6Cl(NH4Cl6)] were constructed, and exhibit strong second&#8208;harmonic generation response from 800 to 980&#8197;nm. The second&#8208;order nonlinear optical coefficient of the chiral metal&#8208;free anti&#8208;perovskite reaches 0.89&#8197;pm/V, which is higher than that of commercial Y&#8208;cut quartz. Most importantly, both R&#8208; and S&#8208;MCN exhibit a large nonlinear optical activity with a high SHG dissymmetry factor (gSHG&#8208;CD) of 0.60 and a high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold of 71&#8197;mJ/cm2, which is higher than that of most reported chiral perovskites. Our findings indicate that chiral metal&#8208;free anti&#8208;perovskite have the potential to be a valuable addition to the development of next&#8208;generation nonlinear chiroptical devices.

In order to overcome the inherent limitations of metal halide, such as high costs, potential toxicity, challenges with recycling, especially the limited laser-induced damage threshold (LDT), we have successfully constructed the first chiral metal-free anti-perovskite, with the aim of utilizing it in second harmonic generation-circular dichroism (SHG-CD). Moreover, the anti-perovskite composed entirely of small organic ions typically display a more extensive transparent window, which could contribute a high LDT. Herein two chiral metal-free anti-perovskites, &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-MCN [(&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-MBA)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Cl(NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)] were constructed, and exhibit strong second-harmonic generation response from 800 to 980&#8197;nm. The second-order nonlinear optical coefficient of the chiral metal-free anti-perovskite reaches 0.89&#8197;pm/V, which is higher than that of commercial Y-cut quartz. Most importantly, both &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-MCN exhibit a large nonlinear optical activity with a high SHG dissymmetry factor (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;SHG-CD&lt;/sub&gt;) of 0.60 and a high laser-induced damage threshold of 71&#8197;mJ/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is higher than that of most reported chiral perovskites. Our findings indicate that chiral metal-free anti-perovskite have the potential to be a valuable addition to the development of next-generation nonlinear chiroptical devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereoselective P(III)&#8208;Glycosylation for the Preparation of Phosphinated Sugars</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly stereoselective P(III)&#8208;glycosylation reaction is established, proceeding by a nucleophilic addition and release strategy. With simple a &#946;&#8208;phosphino ester as the P(III)&#8208;transfer reagent, a series of anomeric phosphinated sugars are prepared efficiently and stereoselectively, and can be used in bioactive molecule conjugation, as chiral phosphine ligands or organocatalysts.







Abstract
Most of the reported work focus on the development of O&#8208;, N&#8208;, C&#8208; and S&#8208;glycosylation methods. However, no study explores P(III)&#8208;glycosylation reaction. Herein we describe a convenient protocol to realize P(III)&#8208;glycosylation process. A simple &#946;&#8208;phosphino ester is adopted as P(III)&#8208;transfer reagent for this new type of glycosylation via a nucleophilic substitution and release strategy. Diverse phosphine units are introduced to the anomeric center of various sugars efficiently and with excellent stereoselectivity. The value of this method is showcased by the prepared P(III)&#8208;sugars as novel linkers in bioactive molecule conjugation, new chiral ligands in metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitutions and organocatalysts. Preliminary mechanistic studies corroborated the designed P(III)&#8208;transfer process.

         <title>A C156 Molecular Nanocarbon: Planar/Rippled Nanosheets Hybridization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new hybrid nanocarbon composed of dissimilar naonosheets, has been synthesized. This hybrid possesses electronic properties similar to its components and exhibits a highly curved structure with configurational stability. This curved structure was found to accommodate C60 with a binding constant as high as 105&#8197;M&#8722;1. Moreover, this hybrid displays unusual anti&#8208;Kasha fluorescence emission and undergoes singlet fission in the thin film.







Abstract
A novel hybrid nanocarbon consisting of one rippled and two planar nanosheets has been synthesized and characterized. Two meso pairs of [5]helicenes are formed along the long molecular axis of the hybrid to connect rippled and planar subunits, leading to a stable conformation. It is shown that the hybrid possesses the individual electronic properties of the rippled and planar subunits. Compared to the rippled subunit, such hybrid has a better geometric match to C60 and complexes with C60 in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometry, with the association constant on the order of 105&#8197;M&#8722;1. The hybrid displays unusual anti&#8208;Kasha fluorescence emission. The transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that the singlet fission (SF) from higher level singlet excited states (Sn) is operative in the film of the hybrid.

         <title>Convergent Total Synthesis of Kalmanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective total synthesis of kalmanol was achieved by convergent and modular synthetic strategies. Two enantioenriched fragments were assembled by a Grignard reaction/ring&#8208;closing metathesis sequence. The remaining hydroxy groups were installed by precise late&#8208;stage oxidations.







Abstract
Kalmanol (1) is the first isolated kalmane&#8208;type grayanoid featuring a highly oxidized 5/8/5/5 tetracyclic carbon skeleton and 9 contiguous stereocenters. We have accomplished the efficient and asymmetric total synthesis of 1 in 16&#8197;steps from known compounds (20&#8197;steps from commercially available starting materials) by a modular synthetic strategy. A tetracyclic intermediate was prepared in a convergent manner through a Grignard reaction and a subsequent ring&#8208;closing metathesis reaction of two enantiomerically enriched fragments. The polyhydroxy groups were introduced by late&#8208;stage stereo&#8208; and regioselective oxidations.

         <title>Multifunctional, Fluorene&#8208;Based Modulator of Cholinergic and GABAergic Neurotransmission as a Novel Drug Candidate for Palliative Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Patients with Alzheimer's disease need immediate help. In this work, we present a new approach to treating cognitive deficits alongside the psychological symptoms of dementia. Through a combination of biological screening, crystallography, and computational methods, we have developed an innovative drug candidate &#8211; a dual modulator of cholinergic and GABAergic neurotransmission. Comprehensive in vivo evaluation demonstrates its strong potential for a breakthrough.







Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory loss and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Given that cholinergic neurons are predominantly affected in AD, current treatments primarily aim to enhance cholinergic neurotransmission. However, imbalances in other neurotransmitters, such as &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA), also contribute to AD symptomatology. In the presented research, using a combination of crystallography and computational methods we developed compound 6 as a dual modulator of GABAergic and cholinergic neurotransmission systems. Compound 6 demonstrated inhibition of BuChE (IC50=0.21&#8197;&#956;M) and GABA transporter 1 (IC50=10.96&#8197;&#956;M) and 3 (IC50=7.76&#8197;&#956;M), along with a favorable drug&#8208;likeness profile. Subsequent in vivo studies revealed the effectiveness of 6 in enhancing memory retention and alleviating anxiety and depression symptoms in animal models, while also proving safe and bioavailable for oral administration. The innovative multi&#8208;target&#8208;directed ligand 6 offers a new approach to treating cognitive deficits and BPSD in AD.

         <title>Combination of Ambient and High&#8208;Temperature Beryllium Nitride Motifs in W2Be4N5 and W4Be8N9</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two first transition metal nitridoberyllates W2Be4N5 and W4Be8N9 were synthesized in a high&#8208;temperature high&#8208;pressure approach starting from Be3N2, W and NH4N3 or NaN3, respectively. The layered crystal structures, which unite ambient and high&#8208;temperature motifs of beryllium nitride, was elucidated in a combined approach of several analytic techniques. The structure elucidation from X&#8208;ray diffraction data alone was not unambiguous.







Abstract
Compounds of transition metals and beryllium have a wide range of applications, from everyday tools to high tech applications. Remarkably, no single ternary beryllium nitride with a transition metal is known. Here, we report on the synthesis and properties of the first transition metal nitridoberyllates, namely W2Be4N5 and W4Be8N9. Both compounds were synthesized in a high&#8208;temperature high&#8208;pressure approach from Be3N2 and W, using azide generated N2 as an oxidizing agent. The crystal structures, consisting of alternating layers of WN6 trigonal prisms and BeN4 tetrahedra, were elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (sc&#8208;XRD). The separating nitridoberyllate layers show either ambient temperature (&#945;&#8208;Be3N2 type) or high temperature (&#946;&#8208;Be3N2 type) motifs. W2Be4N5 was further corroborated by infrared (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and UV/Vis spectroscopy and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) measurements. The latter revealed a mixed valence with an intermediate oxidation state of 3.5 for the W atoms. Both, the synthesis of the first transition metal nitridoberyllates and the synthesis approach using elemental W pave the way to a new field of nitride chemistry.

         <title>Neuromorphic Nanofluidic Sense Digitalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neuromorphic nanofluidic sense digitalization is devised by a nanofluidic dopaminergic nerve to manage the robot. The dopamine recognition by aptamer and the corresponding ionic signaling are more analogous to the processes in biology. Dopaminergic modulation of synaptic transmission is uncovered by many neurologic functions, and control of the robotic arm is realized by digital representation of the dopamine&#8208;dependent plasticity.







Abstract
Nanofluidic memristors have recently been reshaped into artificial synapses capable of mimicking many fundamental neurosynaptic patterns, while sense digitalization has been increasingly explored to link the neuromorphic devices with external equipment. By inspiration of dopaminergic nerve, here a nanofluidic nerve with sense digitalization is devised by engineering a dopamine (DA)&#8208;specific nanofluidic synapse as mediated by PC&#8208;12 cells to manage the robotic arm. Different from previous neuromorphic perception of DA via redox reaction, the aptamer&#8208;based perception here is based on biological DA recognition by its receptor as indicated by the ionic signals. Various neurosynaptic patterns are emulated with DA&#8208;dependent plasticity, based on which the digital representation of DA perception is used to control the robotic arm.

         <title>Benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Phosphonylation via Dual Photo and Copper Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for direct benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H phosphonylation of non&#8208;specialized alkylarenes is reported. This dehydrogenative C&#8722;P bond formation method features high step economy and takes place under mild reaction conditions, which enables good functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction proceeds via intermolecular hydrogen atom abstraction and operates by a radical pathway.







Abstract
Alkyl phosphonates are important motifs in medicinal chemistry, yet their efficient synthesis by direct C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization remains a challenge. Here, we report straightforward access to benzylic phosphonates by direct C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization in a cross&#8208;dehydrogenative&#8208;coupling reaction between non&#8208;specialized alkylarenes and unfunctionalized phosphites. Notably, the C&#8722;H substrates are used as the limiting reagents. The scope of benzylic C&#8722;H substrates is broad, and the mild reaction conditions allow for good functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction proceeds via a radical pathway rather than the cationic pathway followed for specialized benzylic C&#8722;H substrates in previous methods.

         <title>Support&#8208;Layer Integrated Zeolite Membranes through In Situ Interfacial Transformation of Clay&#8208;Based Protomembranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clay&#8208;based protomembranes transformed into support&#8208;layer integrated zeolite membranes by interfacial transformation without solvents. Inexpensive clay in protomembrane not only served as a raw material for the support but also provided active ingredients for the growth of zeolite crystals, which not only reduced the membrane preparation cost and environmental cost, but also improved the separation performance and stability of zeolite membranes.







Abstract
Zeolite membranes are considered ideal inorganic membrane materials for separating mixtures with molecular&#8208;level differences. However, their complex preparation process with excessive synthesis solutions for traditional hydrothermal heating methods leads to various drawbacks. Here, we describe a membrane preparation strategy involving an in situ interfacial transformation of the protomembrane without solvents. Inexpensive clay powder forms the protomembrane, and the active ingredients subsequently migrate from the interior of this protomembrane to its surface and transform into a zeolite layer. Ultimately, the protomembrane is calcined to obtain the support&#8208;layer integrated zeolite membrane. Systematic research shows that clay not only serves as a raw material for the support but also provides active ingredients for the growth of zeolite crystals; thus, zeolite membranes with zeolite particles inserted into the support are formed. The zeolite membrane calcined at 800&#8201;&#176;C possesses a p&#8208;xylene/o&#8208;xylene separation factor approaching 6263 with a permeation flux of 1.21&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201; m&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201; s&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201; Pa&#8722;1. This interfacial transformation method can be applied to other membranes and promote the development of membrane separation technology.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Formation of Three&#8208;Dimensional Network Intrinsic Microporous Ladder Polymer Membranes with Ultra&#8208;High Gas Separation Performance and Anti&#8208;Trade&#8208;Off Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of in situ crosslinked three&#8208;dimensional network intrinsic microporous ladder polymer membranes were synthesized by a facile copolymerization method. Their highly crosslinked structure led to enhanced microporosity with a large fraction of submicropores (&lt;4&#8197;&#197;). They showed an anti&#8208;trade&#8208;off effect and superior H2/CH4, H2/N2, and O2/N2 separation performance with great potential in H2 purification and O2 enrichment applications.







Abstract
The global quest for clean energy and sustainable processes makes advanced membrane extremely attractive for energy&#8208;intensive industrial gas separations. Here, we disclose a series of ultra&#8208;high&#8208;performance gas separation membranes (PIM&#8208;3D&#8208;TB) from novel network polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIM) that combine the advantages of solution processible PIM and small pore size distribution (PSD) of porous organic polymers (POP), which was synthesized by in situ copolymerization of triptycene&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamine as linear part and triptycene&#8208;2,6,13(14)&#8208;triamine (TTA) as crosslinker. The resulting PIM&#8208;3D&#8208;TB membranes demonstrated outstanding separation properties that outperformed the latest trade&#8208;off lines for H2/CH4 and O2/N2. They also showed an anti&#8208;trade&#8208;off effect by simultaneously enhancing gas permeability and gas&#8208;pair selectivity with increasing TTA content. The TTA crosslinking node increased the microporosity, and, shifted the PSD from the ultramicropore (&lt;7&#8197;&#197;) toward the more size sieving submicropore (&lt;4&#8197;&#197;) region. The post&#8208;treated TTA&#8208;75 displayed an exceptional H2 permeability of 8000 Barrer and H2/CH4 selectivity of 208.

&lt;p&gt;A series of in situ crosslinked three-dimensional network intrinsic microporous ladder polymer membranes were synthesized by a facile copolymerization method. Their highly crosslinked structure led to enhanced microporosity with a large fraction of submicropores (&amp;lt;4&#8197;&#197;). They showed an anti-trade-off effect and superior H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation performance with great potential in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; purification and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; enrichment applications.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global quest for clean energy and sustainable processes makes advanced membrane extremely attractive for energy-intensive industrial gas separations. Here, we disclose a series of ultra-high-performance gas separation membranes (PIM-3D-TB) from novel network polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIM) that combine the advantages of solution processible PIM and small pore size distribution (PSD) of porous organic polymers (POP), which was synthesized by &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; copolymerization of triptycene-2,6-diamine as linear part and triptycene-2,6,13(14)-triamine (TTA) as crosslinker. The resulting PIM-3D-TB membranes demonstrated outstanding separation properties that outperformed the latest trade-off lines for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. They also showed an anti-trade-off effect by &lt;i&gt;simultaneously&lt;/i&gt; enhancing gas permeability &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; gas-pair selectivity with increasing TTA content. The TTA crosslinking node increased the microporosity, and, shifted the PSD from the ultramicropore (&amp;lt;7&#8197;&#197;) toward the more size sieving submicropore (&amp;lt;4&#8197;&#197;) region. The post-treated TTA-75 displayed an exceptional H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; permeability of 8000 Barrer and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of 208. These PIM-3D-TB membranes and their design protocol have unparalleled potential in the next generation of membranes for hydrogen purification and air separations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiroptical Amplification of [7]&#8208;Helicene Nanographene by Additional Helical Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of &#960;&#8208;extended helical nanographenes have been explored for their optical and chiroptical properties. The introduction of an additional helical subunit with preferred handedness controls and boosts the optical and chiroptical properties including dissymmetry factor (glum), fluorescence quantum yield (&#966;), and circularly polarized luminescence brightness (BCPL) of the helical nanographene.







Abstract
Nanographenes have captivated scientific interest since the pioneering discovery of graphene. Recently, attention has shifted towards exploring chiral and nonplanar nanographenes, for their distinct optical, chiroptical, and electronic properties. Despite the growing acceptance of helicenes, the research on inducing helical chirality on &#960;&#8208;extended derivatives to boost chiroptical properties remains unattended. In our study, we introduce a new &#960;&#8208;extended [7]&#8208;helicene resulting from the condensation of diamines with 3,6&#8208;dibromophenanthrene&#8208;9,10&#8208;dione, complemented by two hexabenzocoronene arms in the periphery. Notably, the nanographene containing binaphtho&#8208;[1,4]diazocine, compared to the corresponding phenazine, exhibits a remarkable average 2.5, 5, and 10&#8208;fold enhancements in quantum yield, dissymmetry factor, and brightness, respectively, when measured in five different solvents. These improvements underscore the significance of the induced helical chirality by the antiaromatic binaphtho&#8208;[1,4]diazocine in influencing the chiroptical properties of the helical nanographene. Our research represents a significant stride toward unlocking the potential of &#960;&#8208;extended helicenes and lays the groundwork for further exploration in designing and synthesizing new chiral nanomaterials.

         <title>Cascading Water Activation and Interfacial Lattice Oxygen over Nanocluster CuOx&#8208;Modified MnO2 for Electrocatalytic Propylene Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel *OOH pathway was proposed over nanocluster CuOx&#8208;modified MnO2 by coupling *OH from water decomposition at oxygen vacancies and interfacial lattice oxygen, resulting in an efficient electrochemical conversion of propylene to propylene glycol with impressive yields and Faraday efficiencies.







Abstract
Direct electrooxidation of propylene using water&#8208;oxidation intermediates represents a promising route for propylene glycol production. Unfortunately, this economic and environmentally friendly process suffers from low yield and poor Faradaic efficiency resulting from the mismatched oxidative capacity of reactive oxygen species and pronounced side reactions. Herein, we developed an earth&#8208;abundant metal&#8208;based nanocluster CuOx&#8208;modified MnO2 catalyst for the efficient electrooxidation of propylene into propylene glycol, achieving a remarkable production rate of 63.0&#8197;g/m2/h and 95&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency at 1.3&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl. Mechanistic studies revealed that the oxygen vacancy&#8208;mediated water activation on CuOx&#8208;MnO2 in synergy with the activated interfacial lattice oxygen drove the propylene oxidation to a novel *OOH pathway rather than the traditional *OH route. Additionally, the interfacial interactions intensified the propylene adsorption and polarization for its activation. This work offers new insights into the mechanism of electrocatalytic propylene oxidation and presents great opportunities for the synthesis of commercial chemicals based on earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysts and renewable electricity&#8208;driven route.

         <title>Functionalization of Covalent Organic Frameworks with Cyclopentadienyl Cobalt for C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the use of isoreticular chemistry to synthesize two novel two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COFs functionalized with cyclopentadienyl cobalt. UPC&#8208;COF&#8208;1 with shorter building blocks exhibits high C2H2 capacity and promising C2H2/CO2 separation performance. In addition, UPC&#8208;COF&#8208;1 can maintain separation stability in the presence of water vapor and methane impurities.







Abstract
Emerging covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have received great attention for their unique features, but the limited building blocks restrict their structural diversity and performance exploration. Reticular chemistry provides guidance for the structural expansion and performance regulation of COFs. Herein, we constructed two novel two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COFs functionalized with cyclopentadienyl cobalt, denoted as UPC&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and UPC&#8208;COF&#8208;2, via [4+2] imine condensation with diamine building blocks of different length. Theoretical simulations combined with experimental results reveal that UPC&#8208;COF&#8208;1 with shorter building blocks, narrower pore sizes, and stronger host&#8211;guest interactions has better C2H2/CO2 separation performance. In addition, UPC&#8208;COF&#8208;1 can maintain separation stability in the presence of water vapor and methane impurities. This work provides a new evidence for the performance regulation of isoreticular COFs with modular and tunable building blocks.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Neutral Carboxylation of Benzylic Tertiary C&#8722;H Bonds with Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photocatalysis combined with cascade hydrogen atom transfer cycles for the carboxylation of benzylic tertiary C&#8722;H bond with CO2 is reported. The power of this strategy is demonstrated for the late&#8208;stage carboxylation of broad bioactive molecule derivatives to obtain benzylic all&#8208;carbon quaternary carboxylic acids.







Abstract
The direct catalytic carboxylation of benzylic tertiary C&#8722;H bonds with CO2 for the synthesis of all&#8208;carbon quaternary carboxylic acids represents a significant challenge. Here, we present a redox&#8208;neutral approach to address this difficulty by leveraging the synergistic interplay between photocatalysis and cascade hydrogen abstraction cycles. Remarkably, this strategy eliminates the need for sacrificial electron donors, electron acceptors, or stoichiometric additives, offering enhanced atom economy and environmental sustainability. It is particular that the combination of &#945;&#8208;amino alkyl radicals with sulfur radicals generated in&#8197;situ from the decomposition of DMSO was employed to realize the abstraction of benzylic tertiary C&#8722;H bonds. Our method enables the direct synthesis of a diverse array of benzylic quaternary carboxylic acids with excellent functional group tolerance as well as the derivatization of bioactive molecules and the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of pharmaceuticals under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Linker Installation in a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Enhanced Quantitative Redox Species Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) demonstrate remarkable versatility, enabling tailored properties and functions through targeted design and modification. Linker installation provides an efficient approach to achieve specific alterations. Notably, a series of redox&#8208;active dyes were successfully integrated into the Zr&#8208;MOF PCN&#8208;700, enabling enhanced&#8208;type quantitative recognition of diverse reductants and oxidants.







Abstract
Linker installation has proven to be an effective strategy for introducing diverse functional groups into metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Reductants and oxidants are found in various environments, but their accumulation poses a danger due to their high reactivity, necessitating prompt monitoring instantly, particularly in natural environments and industrial processes. In this study, a series of redox&#8208;active dyes were successfully incorporated into a flexible Zr&#8208;based MOF, PCN&#8208;700, through linker installation strategy. Notably, both the reduction of PCN&#8208;700&#8208;Resazurin towards oxidants and oxidation of PCN&#8208;700&#8208;Amplex Red towards reductants result in the formation of PCN&#8208;700&#8208;Resorufin, which exhibit visible color changes and largely elevated luminescent intensities, giving rise to the quantitative recognition of reductants and oxidants. This work presents a straightforward approach to developing efficient luminescent sensors for the rapid qualitative and quantitative detection of reductants and oxidants, extending the sensing mechanism from common energy transfer to electron transfer and demonstrating the MOF's versability as a highly designable sensing material for target analytes.

         <title>Visualization and Quantification of Single&#8208;Base m6A Methylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design a TadA8.20&#8208;assisted N6&#8208;methyladenosine RNA imaging at single&#8208;base resolution (TARS) method for in situ visualization of both A and m6A forms at specific RNA sites within single cells. This method enables the quantification of m6A modification fractions, providing precise and detailed insights into m6A modifications at the single&#8208;base level.







Abstract
N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) has emerged as the most prevalent form of RNA modification found across various RNA classes. The detection and quantification of m6A RNA modifications under various physiological conditions are crucial for elucidating disease mechanisms and identifying potential therapeutic targets. However, visualizing intracellular m6A modifications at single&#8208;base resolution remains a significant challenge. Existing methods based on high&#8208;throughput sequencing or in vitro assays are not suitable for in situ m6A RNA imaging. In this work, we introduce the TadA8.20&#8208;assisted N6&#8208;methyladenosine RNA imaging at single&#8208;base resolution (TARS) method for precise visualization and quantification of both A and m6A forms at specific RNA sites within single cells. Validation studies using TARS on MALAT1 lncRNA in HeLa cells and CCND1 mRNA in breast cancer cell lines demonstrated its high specificity and efficiency in mapping and quantifying m6A modifications at single&#8208;base resolution. TARS represents a novel tool that advances m6A RNA modification research by offering accurate and detailed insights into m6A modifications at the single&#8208;base level.

         <title>Electrodriven ATP Synthesis via a Reconstructed Thylakoid Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve electrodriven ATP synthesis, we designed an ATP synthesis module by coupling electrochemical &#916;pH establishment with planar thylakoid membranes (pTMs). The &#916;pH drove the rotation of ATPase at the pTMs to synthesis ATP. This model provides a paradigm to ATP synthesis from electricity, thus bring opportunity in electricity&#8208;powered in vitro biotransformation systems.







Abstract
Nature produces ATP, the energy currency, by converting solar energy (photophosphorylation) and chemical energy (substrate&#8208;level phosphorylation and oxidative phosphorylation). Green electricity, as a significant and sustainable energy carrier, plays a crucial role in achieving a carbon&#8208;neutral society. In this work, we established and verified a novel electrodriven phosphorylation method. Spinach thylakoid membranes (TMs), enriched with ATPases, were isolated and constructed into planar TMs (pTMs) on a proton exchange membrane (PEM), effectively imparting the traditional PEM with the biological function of ATP regeneration. Following the optimization of TMs concentration and incubation time, the biological PEM was integrated into a two&#8208;compartment electrochemical cell, where ATP was successfully synthesized by ATPase of pTMs, triggered by the proton gradient potential generated during electrochemical water splitting. When a constant voltage of 3&#8197;V was applied to the electrochemical cells, ATP was synthesized at a rate of 3.16&#8197;&#956;M&#8201;min&#8722;1&#956;gChl&#8722;1, approximately twice the rate of &#916;pH&#8208;driven ATP synthesis. This design offers substantial potential for green energy applications in in vitro biotransformation (ivBT) systems.

         <dc:description>
A practical cobalt&#8208;catalyzed regioselective silylamidation that rapidly and reliably incorporates dioxazolones and silylzinc pivalates into unconjugated alkenyl amides has been disclosed, which can be further extended to the context of peptide ligation, unlocking a new platform for modular access to silicon&#8208;containing amino acid derivatives and peptides.







Abstract
A regioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component silylamidation that rapidly and reliably incorporates dioxazolones and silylzinc pivalates into unconjugated alkenyl amides is disclosed. Notably, the unique power of this protocol is demonstrated by the possibility of achieving peptide ligation using peptide&#8208;containing dioxazolones or alkenyl amides as the coupling partners. Moreover, this approach is distinguished by its mild condition, synthetic simplicity, and ample scope, thus providing a new platform for modular access to silicon&#8208;containing amino acid derivatives and peptides.

         <title>Development and Applications of an Amide Linchpin Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amide/NCO linchpin: A linchpin reagent for the synthesis of amides is disclosed using rhodium&#8208;catalyzed electrophilic amination followed by Grignard addition. The sequence proceeds with high chemoselectivity and provides secondary and tertiary amides through atypical bond construction. The formation of lactams and unsymmetrical ureas demonstrates extension to other NCO systems.







Abstract
Linchpin reagents are building blocks that can be chemoselectively functionalized to afford products with a common, useful functional group. In this work, we describe the development and validation of the first amide linchpin reagent and demonstrate its use as a doubly electrophilic building block for the synthesis of a variety of amides, including challenging classes. The linchpin reagent was first functionalized via rhodium&#8208;catalyzed electrophilic amination. Selected masked C&#8208;isocyanate products were then further derivatized with Grignard reagents to produce secondary amides, or tertiary amides if an alkylating agent was added subsequently. The success of this sequence relies on fully controlled reactivity at each electrophilic site, first exploiting the weak N&#8722;O bond and then, the ability to form the free isocyanate intermediate in situ. The overall transformation proceeds with high chemoselectivity, demonstrating the ability of this new linchpin reagent to form amides through atypical bond construction. Finally, the potential of this reagent as a more broadly applicable NCO linchpin is demonstrated by the formation of lactams and unsymmetrical ureas.

In this work, we describe the development and validation of the first amide linchpin reagent and demonstrate its use as a doubly electrophilic building block for the synthesis of a variety of amides, including challenging classes. The linchpin reagent was first functionalized via rhodium-catalyzed electrophilic amination. Selected masked &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-isocyanate products were then further derivatized with Grignard reagents to produce secondary amides, or tertiary amides if an alkylating agent was added subsequently. The success of this sequence relies on fully controlled reactivity at each electrophilic site, first exploiting the weak N&#8722;O bond and then, the ability to form the free isocyanate intermediate in situ. The overall transformation proceeds with high chemoselectivity, demonstrating the ability of this new linchpin reagent to form amides through atypical bond construction. Finally, the potential of this reagent as a more broadly applicable NCO linchpin is demonstrated by the formation of lactams and unsymmetrical ureas.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Flexible ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite Membrane for High&#8208;Performance Helium Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous and scalable ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite membranes have been successfully fabricated on polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) polymer supports. The prepared ZSM&#8208;5 membranes exhibit high flexibility that allows helium separation from natural gas under various circumstances. The helium separation performance exceeds those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes.







Abstract
Flexible zeolite membranes are promising for scalable and adaptable separation of critical gases such as helium; however, the synthesis of such membranes remains a significant challenge. In this study, we report the successful fabrication of crack&#8208;free ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite membranes on polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) supports using a seeded growth method. PTFE&#8208;supported membranes exhibit unprecedented helium permeance of over 6.7&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;mol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;Pa&#8722;1 and high He/N2 and He/CH4 separation factors of 17 and 83 respectively, surpassing current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes. These flexible membranes maintain excellent separation performance even after bending and stretching. Furthermore, large&#8208;scale membranes demonstrate stable helium separation from multicomponent gas mixtures, showcasing their significant potential for practical helium extraction from natural gas.

         <title>Cleavage and Reassembly of 1,3&#8208;Dicarbonyls with Enaminones to Synthesize Highly Functionalized Naphthols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tandem assembly of 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls and enaminones into highly functionalized naphthols has been developed in a process that stands out for the readily accessible raw materials, simple operation in the atmosphere, and excellent substrate compatibility. The products can easily be converted into drug scaffolds.







Abstract
The cleavage of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds and their subsequent reassembly into highly functionalized and useful molecules in an atom&#8208;efficient manner has always been a central focus in the realm of organic synthesis. In this report, we describe the construction of highly functionalized naphthol esters via a tandem reassembly process, driven by Ullmann&#8208;type coupling of enaminones and 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds. Mechanistic investigations suggest the involvement of C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp3) coupling, cyclization, two acyl migrations, aromatization, and additional transformations within this tandem sequence. This methodology offers several notable advantages, such as the use of inexpensive and easily accessible starting materials, the elimination of the need for expensive transition metal catalysis, simple operation in the atmosphere, exceptional compatibility with a wide range of substrates, and ease of conversion into drug scaffolds.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of 1,n&#8208;Dicarbonyl Compounds Through Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Ring Opening/Isomerization of Densely Substituted Cyclopropanols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the stereoselective synthesis of highly substituted cyclopropanols and their palladium&#8208;catalyzed stereospecific transformation into 1,4&#8208; and 1,5&#8208;dicarbonyls. The developed ring opening/chain walking sequence enables access to dialdehydes and ketoaldehydes bearing vicinal tertiary and quaternary stereocenters as single diastereomers in moderate to high yields.







Abstract
We report a highly diastereoselective protocol for the synthesis of 1,4&#8208; and 1,5&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds from densely substituted cyclopropanols. The methodology involves a palladium&#8208;catalyzed ring opening reaction followed by a &#8220;metal&#8208;walk&#8221; and oxidation of a remote hydroxyl group. The methodology represents a new application of cyclopropanols as initiation sites for chain walking remote functionalization. Importantly, this approach provides a straightforward access to highly valuable succinaldehyde derivatives bearing vicinal quaternary and tertiary stereocenters as single diastereomers.

         <title>Asymmetric Heck Silylation of Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we present for the first time a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed Heck silylation of unactivated alkenes with hydrosilane to afford the axially chiral alkenes with good yields and 87 to 98&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
Heck silylation of unactivated alkenes is an efficient strategy for the synthesis of useful organosilicon compounds. However, extensive efforts have been dedicated to only achieving achiral molecules. Herein, a highly regio&#8208; and enantioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed Heck silylation of unactivated alkenes with hydrosilanes is reported for the first time, providing access to axially chiral alkenes in good to excellent yields with 87&#8211;98&#8201;% ee. Aryl and alkyl groups as well as quaternary carbon centers at the 4&#8208;position of vinylcyclohexane could be well tolerated, featuring good functional group tolerance. The gram&#8208;scale reaction proceeds smoothly under mild conditions even with 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst loading. A possible mechanism has been proposed, in which enantioselectivity is controlled by alkene insertion. A templating strategy that enhances weak bond interaction is employed to control regioselectivity by modifying the substituents on the ligand and silane.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Solution&#8208;Processable Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diode Based on a Narrowband Near&#8208;Ultraviolet Emitter and a Hot Exciton Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;ultraviolet emitter (ICz&#8208;BO) has been designed with two simple multiple resonance skeletons. ICz&#8208;BO shows a narrowband near&#8208;ultraviolet emission at 404&#8197;nm with a small FWHM of 28&#8197;nm in toluene, while a solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diode based on the ICz&#8208;BO emitter showed an EQEmax of 12.01&#8201;% and a low CIEy of 0.031.







Abstract
Achieving high efficiency narrowband near&#8208;ultraviolet (NUV) emitters in organic light emitting diode (OLED) is still a formidable challenge. Herein, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept hybridized local and charge transfer (HLCT) molecule, named ICz&#8208;BO, is prepared and characterized, in which both multiresonant (MR) skeletons are integrated via conjugation connection. A slightly distorted structure and weak intramolecular charge transfer (CT) interaction between two MR subunits lead to a high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing (h&#8208;RISC) channel of T6&#8594;S1, also evidenced by both experimental and calculated results. Impressively, the ICz&#8208;BO emitter exhibits outstanding narrowband NUV emission at 404&#8197;nm with a full&#8208;width at half maximum of 28&#8197;nm in toluene solution. The solution processable OLED shows an excellent device performance with the recorded maximum external quantum efficiency of 12.01&#8201;%, concomitant with an extremely low y&#8208;axis Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIEy) value of 0.031. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest efficiency reported for the HLCT&#8208;based NUV&#8208;OLEDs to date. This research proves that the MR skeleton plays a positive effect on the narrowband hot exciton emitter, which provides an alternative paradigm for developing high&#8208;efficiency NUV emitters.

ICz-BO shows a narrowband near-ultraviolet emission at 404&#8197;nm with a small FWHM of 28&#8197;nm in toluene, while a solution-processed organic light-emitting diode based on the ICz-BO emitter showed an EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 12.01&#8201;% and a low CIE&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.031.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieving high efficiency narrowband near-ultraviolet (NUV) emitters in organic light emitting diode (OLED) is still a formidable challenge. Herein, a proof-of-concept hybridized local and charge transfer (HLCT) molecule, named ICz-BO, is prepared and characterized, in which both multiresonant (MR) skeletons are integrated via conjugation connection. A slightly distorted structure and weak intramolecular charge transfer (CT) interaction between two MR subunits lead to a high-lying reverse intersystem crossing (h-RISC) channel of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, also evidenced by both experimental and calculated results. Impressively, the ICz-BO emitter exhibits outstanding narrowband NUV emission at 404&#8197;nm with a full-width at half maximum of 28&#8197;nm in toluene solution. The solution processable OLED shows an excellent device performance with the recorded maximum external quantum efficiency of 12.01&#8201;%, concomitant with an extremely low y-axis Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;) value of 0.031. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest efficiency reported for the HLCT-based NUV-OLEDs to date. This research proves that the MR skeleton plays a positive effect on the narrowband hot exciton emitter, which provides an alternative paradigm for developing high-efficiency NUV emitters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Assisted Bottom&#8208;Up Synthesis of Orange Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates the successful synthesis of a polar phosphorus allotrope, termed &#8220;orange phosphorus,&#8221; using a photo&#8208;assisted bottom&#8208;up technique. The structure, consisting of unidirectionally aligned tubular pentagons of [P8]P2[, was confirmed through 3D electron diffraction analysis. The outstanding piezoresistivity of [P8]P2[ highlights its potential applications.







Abstract
A tubular strand of phosphorus composed of vectorially aligned pentagons has been theoretically predicted as a new allotrope of phosphorus with a polar structure, expecting potential applications. However, it has not been successfully synthesized yet due to the difficulty of creating isolated strands to avoid interchain bonding. Here, such an allotrope named &#8220;orange phosphorus&#8220; was successfully produced using a photo&#8208;assisted synthesis from an amorphous film of solution&#8208;processable Na2P16 precursors. A green laser irradiation initiated the phase transition of precursors, inducing chemical reactions like topochemical polymerization and rearrangement, creating a 1D chain of orange phosphorus. 3D electron diffraction crystallography showed that the molecular structure of orange phosphorus consists of one&#8208;dimensional polar pentagonal&#8208;tubes made up of [P8]P2[ repeat units. Orange phosphorus demonstrates excellent piezoresistivity due to its high strain&#8208;sensitive 1D chain structure, showing strain&#8208;induced Raman shifts. Its gauge factor exceeds those of 2D materials such as black phosphorus and transition metal dichalcogenides. These findings indicate that orange phosphorus has great potential for use in strain sensor applications.

         <title>Transmembrane Delivery of an Aryl Azopyrazole Photo&#8208;switchable Ion Transporter Relay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The delivery of anion relay transporters across lipid membranes using a synthetic flippase is reported. These second generation photo&#8208;responsive relays incorporate an aryl azopyrazole photo&#8208;switch enabling greatly improved reversible photo&#8208;switching of the ion transport activity in&#8197;situ, in real time.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive synthetic ionophores allow for spatial and temporal control over ion transport, with promise for applications in targeted therapy. Relay transporters have emerged as a new class of ion transporters &#8208; these are anchored carriers that sit in both leaflets of the bilayer and mediate transport across the membrane by passing ions between them. The relays are themselves membrane impermeable, and so must be incorporated into the membrane during vesicle preparation. Here we show that relay transporters can be delivered to both sides of the membrane of vesicles using a synthetic flippase. By incorporating an aryl azopyrazole photo&#8208;switch into the movable arm of the relay transporters the ion transport activity can be very efficiently and reversibly switched between off and on states. This control is achieved by extension and contraction of their movable arms via photo&#8208;isomerization of the central aryl azopyrazole moiety, hence modulating the ability of the relays to pass ions across the membrane.

         <dc:description>
The discovery of a new reactivity mode for &#960;&#8208;arene metal complexes to promote carbon group insertion is reported. The reaction uses ruthenium &#951;6&#8208;arene complexes supported by a tripodal ligand with enolates derived from &#945;&#8208;halo&#8208; or &#945;&#8208;(tosyloxy)esters to transform &#960;&#8208;coordinated arenes to ring&#8208;expanded cycloheptatrienes in a single&#8208;step dearomatization process.







Abstract
Transition metal &#960;&#8208;arene complexes enable the dearomatization of benzene rings to access diversified unsaturated carbocycles through multistep synthetic procedures involving sequential addition of nucleophiles and electrophiles. This work details a single&#8208;step dearomatization process by reaction of Ru(&#951;6&#8208;arene) complexes with enolates derived from &#945;&#8208;halo or &#945;&#8208;(tosyloxy)esters to directly transform &#960;&#8208;coordinated arenes to ring&#8208;expanded cycloheptatrienes.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive DNA Nanomachines for Intracellular Targeted Electrochemiluminescence Imaging in Single Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stimulus&#8208;responsive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) engineered nanomachine (RuMOF@DNAgel) was developed to trigger DNA hydrogel shell depolymerization based on the target, and realize controllable ECL imaging analysis of intracellular target biomolecules distribution with 3D spatial resolution. This study provides a reliable strategy for ECL imaging of target intracellular molecules with high selectivity, which could be able to provide more elegant information in microscopy imaging and cellular biology.







Abstract
Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) microscopy has emerged as a powerful technique for single&#8208;cell imaging owing to its unparalleled background&#8208;free imaging advantages. However, controlled intracellular ECL imaging remains challenging. Here, we developed a stimuli&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembled DNA nanomachine that enables the ECL imaging of intracellular target biomolecules in single cells. The ECL nanoprobe consists of an ECL nanoemitter constructed from Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;doped metal&#8211;organic framework as the nanoreactor core, with a DNA polymer hydrogel (DNAgel) shell acting as the stimuli&#8208;gated layer. The outer functionalized DNAgel of the ECL nanoprobe was specifically designed to block ECL generation and to dissociate by ATP molecules, thereby enabling selective recovery of ECL emission capability. Such an engineered stimuli&#8208;responsive nanomachine successfully achieved the targeted ECL imaging of intracellular ATP distribution with spatial resolution. In addition, ECL imaging of various intracellular biomolecules should be generalizable by simply changing the switching DNA sequence of the probe.

&lt;p&gt;A stimulus-responsive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) engineered nanomachine (RuMOF@DNAgel) was developed to trigger DNA hydrogel shell depolymerization based on the target, and realize controllable ECL imaging analysis of intracellular target biomolecules distribution with 3D spatial resolution. This study provides a reliable strategy for ECL imaging of target intracellular molecules with high selectivity, which could be able to provide more elegant information in microscopy imaging and cellular biology.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) microscopy has emerged as a powerful technique for single-cell imaging owing to its unparalleled background-free imaging advantages. However, controlled intracellular ECL imaging remains challenging. Here, we developed a stimuli-responsive self-assembled DNA nanomachine that enables the ECL imaging of intracellular target biomolecules in single cells. The ECL nanoprobe consists of an ECL nanoemitter constructed from Ru(bpy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-doped metal&#8211;organic framework as the nanoreactor core, with a DNA polymer hydrogel (DNAgel) shell acting as the stimuli-gated layer. The outer functionalized DNAgel of the ECL nanoprobe was specifically designed to block ECL generation and to dissociate by ATP molecules, thereby enabling selective recovery of ECL emission capability. Such an engineered stimuli-responsive nanomachine successfully achieved the targeted ECL imaging of intracellular ATP distribution with spatial resolution. In addition, ECL imaging of various intracellular biomolecules should be generalizable by simply changing the switching DNA sequence of the probe. Our research provided a reliable strategy for ECL microscopy within cells, which will broaden the application of ECL in single-cell and single-molecule profiling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioinspired &#8220;Intermolecular Pocket&#8221; in Soft Molecular Crystal of Porous Organic Cage Exhibiting Reversible Guest Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous organic cage (POC) with hydrophobic intermolecular &#8216;pockets&#8217; (HIMPs), constructed upon the lock of hydrophobic groups and disulfide bonds, has been achieved by biomimicking hydrophobic proteins. Similar to the specific substrate recognition observed in biological systems, NKPOC&#8208;DS exhibits selective &#8220;breathing behaviour&#8221; towards C2H6 through the expansion of its HIMPs, which makes NKPOC&#8208;DS a promising candidate for the one&#8208;step purification of C2H4 from a C2H6/C2H4 mixture.







Abstract
Porous Organic Cages (POCs) have gathered a lot of attention in sorts of fields. Previous studies often focused on the functionalization of their intrinsic porosity, while the utilization of the extrinsic porosity has been seldom reported. To date, the rational construction of functionalized extrinsic porosity in POCs is a serious challenge, which still relies on trial and error. Inspired by hydrophobic proteins, in the contribution, a POC (namely NKPOC&#8208;DS) is obtained with hydrophobic &#8220;intermolecular pocket&#8221; as extrinsic porosity constructed through the assembly of disulfide bonds with hydrophobic groups, facilitating strong supramolecular interactions as confirmed by Electrostatic Potential (ESP) maps and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Notably, NKPOC&#8208;DS exhibits a unique C2H6&#8208;selective &#8220;breathing behaviour&#8221; due to the presence of softness in its extrinsic porosity, which does not extend to other gases such as C2H4, CH4, CO2, N2, and H2. Such specific recognition of C2H6 thus provides NKPOC&#8208;DS with the ability to preferentially adsorb C2H6 from a C2H6/C2H4 mixture. The innovative approach of biomimicry in the design of functional POCs provides new insights into manipulating the packing of cages, paving the way for potential applications in guest recognition and adsorption separations.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Bent Perylenediimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of bent perylenediimides (B&#8208;PDIs) with systematically varied bending angles were designed and synthesized by modulating the lengths of linear alkyl chains bridging the two nitrogen atoms of each PDI. This study unveils the curvature&#8208;dependent self&#8208;assembly and excited&#8208;state decay behavior of these B&#8208;PDIs.







Abstract
The properties of &#960;&#8208;functional materials are predominantly influenced by both their molecular structures and interactions between &#960;&#8208;systems. Recent advancements have focused on modifying the geometry or topology of &#960;&#8208;molecules from planar to nonplanar conformations to tailor molecular properties. However, the interactions among nonplanar &#960;&#8208;molecules remain largely unexplored, likely due to the significant reduction in contact surfaces arising from their curved structures. Herein, we investigated the electro&#8208;optical properties and &#960;&#8208;stacking behaviors of a series of bent perylenediimides (B&#8208;PDIs) with gradual changes in bending angles, achieved by altering the lengths of linear alkyl chains connecting the two nitrogen positions of each PDI. Curvature&#8208;dependent self&#8208;assembly of these bent PDIs is observed, which is primarily driven by dipole&#8208;dipole interactions rather than dispersion forces. More importantly, fine&#8208;tuning intermolecular coupling through bending enables excited&#8208;state symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation in [n]B&#8208;PDIs (n = 16, 12) in the crystalline solid state.

         <title>A Scalable Pore&#8208;space&#8208;partitioned Metal&#8208;organic Framework Powered by Polycatenation Strategy for Efficient Acetylene Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D&#8594;3D polycatenation strategy is firstly proposed to construct a scalable pore&#8208;space&#8208;partitioned metal&#8208;organic framework (PSP MOF) with functional N/O sites to balance C2H2 uptake and selectivity by optimizing pore size and host&#8208;guest interactions in the custom&#8208;designed pore. The breakthrough experiments reveal impressive C2H2 productivity from binary and ternary mixtures with excellent recyclability after 20 cycles for separating C2H2/CO2.







Abstract
Efficient separation of acetylene (C2H2) from carbon dioxide (CO2) and ethylene (C2H4) is a significant challenge in the petrochemical industry due to their similar physicochemical properties. Pore space partition (PSP) has shown promise in enhancing gas adsorption capacity and selectivity by reducing pore size and increasing the density of guest binding sites. Herein, we firstly employ the 2D&#8594;3D polycatenation strategy to construct a PSP metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpy, incorporating functional N/O sites to enhance C2H2 purification. The polycatenated framework with optimized pore size and regularity, exhibiting significant improvements over traditional PSP MOFs by resolving the critical contradiction of balancing C2H2 uptake (98.5&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 298&#8201;K, 100&#8197;kPa) and selectivity of C2H2/CO2 (3.4), C2H2/C2H4 (5.9), and C2H2/CH4 (96.4) in a MOF. Breakthrough experiments confirm high&#8208;purity C2H4 (&gt;99.9&#8201;%) and high C2H2 productivity from binary and ternary mixtures. Notably, Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpy exhibits excellent water stability, scalability, and regenerability after 20 cycles for separating C2H2/CO2. Theoretical calculations verify that the strong binding of C2H2 is mainly attributed to the C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O/N interactions between host Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpy and guest C2H2 molecules. The polycatenation strategy not only improved industrial C2H2 purification efficiency but also enriched the design diversity of customized MOFs for other gas separation applications.

         <title>Regioisomeric &#960;&#8208;Extended Nanographene with Long&#8208;Lived Phosphorescence Afterglow</title>

Modifying the connecting position of the nanographene to the carbazole core (2,7&#8722; and 3,6&#8722;) leads to the formation of bent and helical &#960;&#8208;extended nanographenes displaying distinct excited&#8208;state characteristics. Among the regioisomeric nanographenes, the bent nanographene shows a strong red afterglow exceeding 30&#8197;seconds suggesting a clear correlation between the structure and properties of the &#960;&#8208;extended nanographenes.







Abstract
The cutouts of graphene sheets, particularly those with a nonplanar topology, present vast opportunities for advancement. Even a slight deviation from the planar structure can lead to intriguing (chiro)optical features for helically twisted nanographenes. In this context, we introduce two regioisomeric &#960;&#8208;extended nanographenes that exhibit distinct excited&#8208;state characteristics. The helicene structure and the photophysical features can be easily tuned by changing the connecting position of the nanographene to the carbazole core (2,7&#8722; and 3,6&#8722;). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis confirmed the formation of nanographenes with bent and helical conformations. Both derivatives exhibited thermally activated delayed fluorescence at room temperature and phosphorescence at low temperatures. Notably, the nanographene with the bent structure displayed an impressive red afterglow lasting over 30&#8197;seconds, in contrast to the very weak afterglow observed in the helical structure. DFT calculations revealed the existence of an isoenergetic higher triplet state (T8) and comparatively weak spin&#8208;orbit coupling (T1&#8208;S0), thereby enabling the bent nanographene to exhibit a long&#8208;lived component and strong afterglow. Our findings highlight the significance of regioisomeric nanographenes with exceptional optical properties and offer a deeper understanding of the structure&#8211;property relationship in nonplanar nanographenes.

         <title>Host&#8208;in&#8208;Host Complexation: Activating Classical Hosts through Complete Encapsulation within an M9L6 Coordination Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The latent host properties of classical, flexible organic macrocycles&#8212;previously considered incapable of guest binding&#8212;were effectively activated through &#8220;host&#8208;in&#8208;host&#8221; complexation within a large M9L6 coordination cage. This expanded cage thus can &#8220;empower&#8221; the classical hosts by providing complete confinement.







Abstract
This study reports a method for enhancing the functions and properties of traditional organic macrocyclic hosts by fully encapsulating them within a large M9L6 cage to form host&#8208;in&#8208;host complexes. Within the cage host, the macrocyclic organic hosts with electron&#8208;rich aromatic rings, such as cyclotriveratrylene and calix[8]arene, adopt specific orientations enhancing their inherent molecular recognition abilities. Due to the high crystallinity of the M9L6 cage, the guest encapsulation behavior of the host&#8208;in&#8208;host complexes can be observed by X&#8208;ray structural analysis.

         <title>Fragment Discovery by X&#8208;Ray Crystallographic Screening Targeting the CTP Binding Site of Pseudomonas Aeruginosa IspD</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
During a crystallographic screening with IspD from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we identified a fragment residing inside the active site. We confirmed its interactions with the protein by 1H saturation transfer difference NMR spectroscopy. Initial fragment growing yielded derivatives with improved affinity towards IspD from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.







Abstract
With antimicrobial resistance (AMR) reaching alarming levels, new anti&#8208;infectives with unprecedented mechanisms of action are urgently needed. The 2&#8208;C&#8208;methylerythritol&#8208;D&#8208;erythritol&#8208;4&#8208;phosphate (MEP) pathway represents an attractive source of drug targets due to its essential role in numerous pathogenic Gram&#8208;negative bacteria and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mt), whilst being absent in human cells. Here, we solved the first crystal structure of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) IspD, the third enzyme in the MEP pathway and present the discovery of a fragment&#8208;based compound class identified through crystallographic screening of PaIspD. The initial fragment occupies the CTP binding cavity within the active site. Confirmation of fragment&#8211;protein interactions was achieved through 1H saturation&#8211;transfer difference nuclear magnetic resonance (1H&#8208;STD NMR spectroscopy). Building upon these findings and insights from the co&#8208;crystal structures, we identified two growth vectors for fragment growing. We synthesized derivatives addressing both growth vectors, which showed improved affinities for PaIspD. Our new fragment class targets PaIspD, displays promising affinity and favorable growth vectors for further optimization.

         <title>Total Syntheses of &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;Naphthocyclinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first total syntheses of &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;naphthocyclinones, the pyranonaphthoquinone dimers sharing unique dibenzobicyclo[3.2.1]octadienone skeleton, have been accomplished. The challenges are 1)&#8197;stereoselective synthesis of the bicyclic skeleton and 2)&#8197;enantio&#8208; and diasteoselective preparation of the pyranonaphthoquinone monomer. The keys in the total synthesis were 1)&#8197;the design of the common intermediate convertible to both acceptor and donor units, 2)&#8197;chiral Rh&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective 1,4&#8208;addition to couple the monomer units, and 3)&#8197;thiolate&#8208;meditated reductive cyclization to form the bicyclic core.







Abstract
After half a century from their isolation in 1974, we report the first total syntheses of &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;naphthocyclinones, two dimeric pyranonaphthoquinones featuring an unusual bicyclo[3.2.1]octadienone core. The syntheses were achieved with full stereochemical control and functional group management, relying on 1)&#8197;enantioselective construction of the bicyclic core by Rh&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective 1,4&#8208;addition followed by thiolate&#8208;mediated reductive cyclization, and 2)&#8197;judicious design of a common chiral, non&#8208;racemic monomer unit that is capable of divergence into the donor and acceptor units, and reunion to construct the bicyclo[3.2.1]octadienone core.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Monocyclic Luminophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing the low electron transition energies typical of thiocarbonyl compounds, mini phosphors were designed by attaching auxiliary electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on thione cores. Purely organic, near&#8208;infrared (NIR) room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) up to 750&#8197;nm was obtained with a luminophore weighing only 162&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1, which was synthesized starting from a natural product.







Abstract
Compact luminophores with long emission wavelengths have aroused considerable theoretical and practical interest. Organics with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are also desirable for their longer lifetimes and larger Stokes shifts than fluorescence. Utilizing the low electronic transition energy intrinsic to thiocarbonyl compounds, electron&#8208;withdrawing groups were attached to the 4H&#8208;pyran&#8208;4&#8208;thione core to further lower the excited state energies. The resulting mini&#8208;phosphors were doped into suitable polymer matrices. These purely organic, amorphous materials emitted near&#8208;infrared (NIR) RTP. Having a molar mass of only 162&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1, one of the phosphors emitted RTP that peaked at 750&#8197;nm, with a very large Stokes shift of 15485&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (403&#8197;nm). Thanks to the good processability of the polymer film, light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with NIR emission were easily fabricated by coating doped polymer on ultraviolet LEDs. This work provides an intriguing strategy to achieve NIR RTP using compact luminophores.

Organics with room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are also desirable for their longer lifetimes and larger Stokes shifts than fluorescence. Utilizing the low electronic transition energy intrinsic to thiocarbonyl compounds, electron-withdrawing groups were attached to the 4&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-pyran-4-thione core to further lower the excited state energies. The resulting mini-phosphors were doped into suitable polymer matrices. These purely organic, amorphous materials emitted near-infrared (NIR) RTP. Having a molar mass of only 162&#8197;g&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, one of the phosphors emitted RTP that peaked at 750&#8197;nm, with a very large Stokes shift of 15485&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (403&#8197;nm). Thanks to the good processability of the polymer film, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with NIR emission were easily fabricated by coating doped polymer on ultraviolet LEDs. This work provides an intriguing strategy to achieve NIR RTP using compact luminophores.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ni(0)&#8208;Catalyzed Rearrangement of Vinylcyclobutanones (VCBOs) to Synthesize Six&#8208;Membered Non&#8208;Conjugated Enones</title>

         <dc:description>
A Ni&#8208;catalyzed rearrangement of vinylcyclobutanones via vinyl&#8208;group assisted C&#8722;C cleavage enables the synthesis of non&#8208;conjugated six&#8208;membered enones, which are important and difficult to be accessed through other methods.







Abstract
We report here the first nickel&#8208;catalyzed rearrangement of vinylcyclobutanones (VCBOs) under mild conditions to synthesize non&#8208;conjugated cyclohexenone derivatives, which so far do not have many ways to be accessed. The reaction exhibits a wide substrate scope with reaction yields up to 98&#8201;%. This VCBO rearrangement can also be used to access various n/6 (n=5&#8211;8) bicyclic products efficiently. Furthermore, mechanism of this rearrangement has been investigated using DFT calculations, showing that vinyl group&#8208;assisted cyclobutanone C&#8722;C cleavage is easy with a computed activation free energy of 18.1&#8197;kcal/mol.

         <title>Photochemical Deracemization of N&#8208;Carboxyanhydrides En Route to Chiral &#945;&#8208;Amino Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Carboxyanhydrides 1 (NCAs) are activated &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives that can be modified in a minimum&#8208;waste process to give a variety of products. Photochemical deracemization using chiral catalyst 2 for stereochemical editing of the &#945;&#8208;stereogenic center provided access to intermediates (R)&#8208;1 that can be immediately subjected to further transformations.







Abstract
Readily accessible, racemic N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides (NCAs) of &#945;&#8208;amino acids underwent a deracemization reaction upon irradiation at &#955;=366&#8197;nm in the presence of a chiral benzophenone catalyst. The enantioenriched NCAs (up to 98&#8201;% ee) serve as activated &#945;&#8208;amino acid surrogates and, due to their instability, they were directly converted into consecutive products. N&#8208;Protected &#945;&#8208;amino acid esters were obtained after reaction with MeOH and N&#8208;benzoylation (14 examples, 70&#8201;%&#8208;quant., 82&#8211;96&#8201;%&#8197;ee). Other consecutive reactions included amide (ten examples, 65&#8201;%&#8208;quant., 90&#8211;98&#8201;%&#8197;ee) and peptide (three examples, 75&#8211;89&#8201;%, d.&#8201;r.=97/3 to 94/6) bond formation. Limitations of the method relate for some NCAs to issues with solubility, photooxidation, and high configurational lability.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Tunable Ring Expansion Enabled By A Single&#8208;Component Electrophilic Nitrogen Atom Synthon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 6, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hypervalent iodine reagent that allows electrophilic nitrenoid transfer is reported. &#945;&#8208;amination of indanone &#946;&#8208;ketoesters allows divergent ring expansions to either isoquinolones (thermal conditions) or isoquinolines (photochemical conditions). Mechanistic studies for each pathway are presented alongside a comparison to other nitrene precursors.







Abstract
Controllable installation of a single nitrogen atom is central to many major goals in skeletal editing, with progress often gated by the availability of an appropriate N&#8208;atom source. Here we introduce a novel reagent, termed DNIBX, based on dibenzoazabicycloheptadiene (dbabh), which allows the electrophilic installation of dbabh to organic substrates. When indanone &#946;&#8208;ketoesters are aminated by DNIBX, the resulting products undergo divergent ring expansions depending on the mode of activation, producing heterocycles in differing oxidation states under thermal and photochemical conditions. The mechanism of each transformation is discussed, and the different reactivity modes of the indanone&#8208;dbabh adducts are compared to other nitrogenous precursors.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aluminata&#8208;silenes are the elusive heavier counterparts of the well&#8208;known borataalkenes in which the B=C double bond is formally replaced by an Al=Si moiety. We report the isolation of a four&#8208;membered anionic AlSi3 cycle with a bona fide Al=Si double bond, which is obtained by the reaction of 2 eq. of disilenide Tip2Si=SiTipLi with H2AlCl (Tip = 2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl). X&#8208;ray crystallography, UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy and computational analysis confirm the double bond character with a very short Al&#8208;Si bond of 2.283(1) &#197; and high Wiberg bond index (WBI) of 1.31. Intramolecular C&#8208;H activation by the Al=Si bond and the reactions with sulfur sources confirm typical double bond reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Kinetic Resolution Allows Control of Remote Stereochemistry in Asymmetric Hydrogen Borrowing Alkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A catalytic asymmetric method for the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;substituted ketones via hydrogen borrowing alkylation of both racemic linear precursors and 1,5&#8208;diols is described. The base mediated racemization of an intermediate cyclohexenone facilities a dynamic kinetic resolution, affording highly enantioenriched cyclohexanes in excellent yields, which could be further functionalized by removal of the Ph* group. DFT modelling revealed the mode of enantioinduction to be a stepwise process comprising of a hydride transfer and a coordination change to a &#960;&#8208;allylic enolate complex with the iridium catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Interfacial Electric Field of an S&#8722;Scheme Heterojunction by an Ultrasonication&#8208;Triggered Piezoelectric Effect for Sonocatalytic Therapy of Bacterial Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sonodynamic therapy indicates advantages in combating antibiotics&#8208;resistant bacteria and deep tissue infections, but challenges remain in the less efficient charge transfer and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation of sonosensitizers. Herein, an effective bactericidal strategy is developed through enhancing the interfacial electric field (IEF) of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions by an ultrasonication&#8208;triggered piezoelectric effect. Hollow barium titanate (hBT) nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared through template etching, followed by in&#8208;situ assembly of tetrakis (4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (TCPP) with Zn2+ to obtain hBT@ZnTCPP. Both experimental and theoretical evidences support the notion that an IEF is generared from ZnTCPP to hBT. Compared to metalloporphyrins with Fe3+, Mn3+, Cu2+ and Ni2+, the  stronger reduction of ZnTCPP induced by elevation of the orbital energy level of porphyrins after Zn2+ coordination leads to formation of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions. The ultrasonication&#8208;activated polarization field enhances IEF and boosts energy band bending of hBT@ZnTCPP to promote electron&#8208;hole separations and ROS generations. Planktonic methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus and their derived biofilms are completely destroyed within 5&#160;min under ultrasonication through up&#8208;regulating genes of glucose catabolism and ion transportation and down&#8208;regulating genes of ribosomal synthesis and transmembrane transporter. Thus, this study demonstrates molecular&#8208;level modulation of energy levels for S&#8208;scheme heterojunction formation to achieve efficient sonocatalytic therapy of bacterial infections.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Sodium Carboxymethylcellulose Binders for High&#8208;Voltage LiCoO2 via Thermal Pulse Sintering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), as the commercial cathode binder for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, presents several practical challenges, including insufficient conductivity, weak adhesion to active materials, and the use of toxic N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone for slurry preparation. However, while most water&#8208;soluble binders can address the aforementioned issues, they fail to meet the requirements of high&#8208;voltage cathodes. In this work, we innovatively employed a thermal pulse sintering strategy to modify carboxymethyl cellulose sodium (CMC), enabling their application in 4.6 V LiCoO2 (93% capacity retention after 200 cycles). This strategy facilitates the decomposition of electrochemically active carboxyl groups, leading to ring opening reactions that generate numerous ether linkages (&#8208;C&#8208;O&#8208;C&#8208;) without introducing undesirable side effects on LiCoO2. The resulting components form additional charge carrier (i.e., Li+ and e&#8208;) pathways on the cathode surface. Additionally, the heating process also promotes uniform coating of the binder on the surface of LiCoO2, creating a protective layer that inhibits interfacial side reactions. Through proposing a scalable and economic manufacturing technology of multifunctional binder, this work enlightens the avenues for practical high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Precise Prediction of Micro&#8208; and Supra&#8208;pKa Based on 3D Descriptors Integrating Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accurate pKa prediction is crucial for understanding proton dissociation in complex molecular systems. However, existing models often face challenges in addressing subtle stereoelectronic effects and conformational flexibility. This study presents H&#8208;SPOC, a localized 3D descriptor that captures covalent and non&#8208;covalent interactions and incorporates solvent effects to predict site&#8208;specific pKa&#160;values accurately. H&#8208;SPOC was validated on multiple benchmark datasets, including SAMPL6, SAMPL7, and SAMPL8, where it outperformed state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods. H&#8208;SPOC also proved versatile across various applications, including aspirin's non&#8208;equilibrium conformations, glycine's microstate distributions, and the stereoelectronic anomalies of Janus Sponge and Meldrum's Acid. It addressed challenging supra&#8208;pKa&#160;predictions in crystalline environments and accurately correlated pKa with reaction rates, selectivity, tautomerism, and pharmacokinetic properties. With its chemically intuitive design and computational efficiency, H&#8208;SPOC provides an efficient framework for rapid and precise micro&#8208; and supra&#8208;pKa&#160;predictions, offering significant potential in drug discovery, catalysis, and materials science.</dc:description>

         <title>Mitigating Diffusion&#8208;Induced Intragranular Cracking in Single&#8208;Crystal LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 via Extended Solid&#8208;Solution Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;crystal cathodes have been investigated for their inherent resistance to intergranular cracking due to the absence of grain boundaries. However, these materials exhibit significant intergranular cracking, and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we examined the impact of extended solid&#8208;solution reactions on mitigating crack formation in magnesium&#8208;doped single&#8208;crystal LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (Mg&#8208;SC&#8208;LNMO) cathodes. With Mg acting as a structural pillar, the overall volume change was reduced by nearly 50%, the two&#8208;phase reaction was effectively suppressed, and the Li&#8208;ion diffusion coefficient was doubled. Continuum modeling based on experimental observations demonstrates that Mg doping significantly reduces the internal stress induced by lithium diffusion, thereby preserving the mechanical integrity of single&#8208;crystal LNMO. This improvement leads to enhanced electrochemical performance and durability. Our study provides new insights into mechanically robust single&#8208;crystal cathodes and proposes a design strategy to improve the durability of next&#8208;generation Li&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Emissive Oligonucleotides Grafted &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymers for Low&#8208;Temperature Photothermal and Gene Combined Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In order to address the strong hydrophobicity and function limitation of NIR&#8208;II emissive phototheranostic &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (CPs), appropriate modifications are necessary to impart water dispersibility and functionality to CPs. This study uses DNA as the hydrophilic and functional unit to modify CPs, synthesizing CP&#8208;g&#8208;DNA amphiphilic copolymers and producing water&#8208;dispersible oligonucleotide&#8208;modified &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer nanoparticles (OCPNs) by self&#8208;assembly. In addition to DNA's gene regulation abilities that can combine with the low&#8208;temperature photothermal therapy of CPs for enhanced tumor therapy, OCPNs display unique characteristics as novel nanomaterials. On one side, DNA changes the &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions and results in a two&#8208;fold enhancement in NIR&#8208;II fluorescence emission, which greatly benefits tumor imaging. On the other side, DNA varies the surface properties of OCPNs and the nano&#8208;bio interactions. OCPNs exhibit multiple cellular internalization pathways, including caveolae/lipid raft&#8208;mediated uptake for cytoplasm delivery, which may enhance gene transfection combined with the photothermal&#8208;promoted lysosome escape. Moreover, OCPNs can quickly accumulate in tumors due to their higher tissue penetration capability. Taken together, a strategy of using DNA to enable and advance the phototheranostic applications of CPs has been demonstrated, and the distinct properties of OCPNs will open up new biological application opportunities in the future.</dc:description>

OCPNs exhibit multiple cellular internalization pathways, including caveolae/lipid raft-mediated uptake for cytoplasm delivery, which may enhance gene transfection combined with the photothermal-promoted lysosome escape. Moreover, OCPNs can quickly accumulate in tumors due to their higher tissue penetration capability. Taken together, a strategy of using DNA to enable and advance the phototheranostic applications of CPs has been demonstrated, and the distinct properties of OCPNs will open up new biological application opportunities in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Last Piece of the Puzzle: Access to 7&#8208;Connected Zirconium Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Hexane Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zirconium metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Zr&#8208;MOFs) exhibit a wide range of Zr6 cluster connectivities, from 3&#8208;connected to 12&#8208;connected, enabling diverse structural designs. However, odd&#8208;numbered connectivities, especially the 7&#8208;connected Zr&#8208;MOFs, are exceptionally rare due to geometric symmetry challenges. To address this, we developed a geometric pre&#8208;assembly strategy to achieve targeted cluster connectivity. Using this approach, we synthesized NU&#8208;5001 {[Zr6O4(OH)4(H4&#8208;L)2]}, a Zr&#8208;MOF featuring 7&#8208;connected Zr6 clusters, derived from the precursor 6&#8208;connected Zr&#8208;MOF, NU&#8208;5000 {[Zr6O4(OH)4(H3&#8208;L)2]}. NU&#8208;5000, constructed with a tritopic chiral linker H3&#8208;L {(R)&#8208;4,4',4''&#8208;[6'&#8208;chloro&#8208;2,2'&#8208;diethoxy&#8208;(1,1'&#8208;binaphthalene)&#8208;4,4',6&#8208;triyl]tribenzoic acid}, forms a (3,6)&#8208;connected ant topology. Introducing a tetratopic chiral linker, 1,1'&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol tetracarboxylic acid H4&#8208;L {(R)&#8208;4,4',4'',4'''&#8208;[2,2'&#8208;diethoxy&#8208;(1,1'&#8208;binaphthalene)&#8208;4,4',6,6'&#8208;tetrayl]tetrabenzoic acid}, enabled an additional connection, resulting in NU&#8208;5001 with a (3,4,7)&#8208;connected topology. The H4&#8208;L linker acts as either fully 4&#8208;connected or 3&#8208;connected with one arm uncoordinated. Additionally, NU&#8208;5001M {[Zr6O4(OH)4(H4&#8208;L) (H3&#8208;L)]}, an isostructural variant, was synthesized using a mix of H3&#8208;L and H4&#8208;L linkers. NU&#8208;5001&#8217;s unique pore structure and slight flexibility enable distinct adsorption behaviors for hexane isomers, highlighting its potential for kinetic separations. This work completes the Zr6 cluster connectivity landscape and demonstrates the feasibility of tuning Zr&#8208;MOF connectivities through rational linker design, paving the way for rare, low&#8208;symmetry frameworks with tailored properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclometalated Iridium(III) Schiff Base Complexes for Chemiluminogenic Bioprobes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemiluminogenic bioimaging&#160;has&#160;emerged as a promising&#160;paradigm due to its independence from light excitation,&#160;thereby circumventing challenges&#160;related to light penetration depth and background autofluorescence. However,&#160;the availability of effective chemiluminophores&#160;remains limited,&#160;which substantially impedes&#160;their bio&#8208;applications. Herein, we discovered for the first time that cyclometalated iridium(III) Schiff base complexes can&#160;unexpectedly generate chemiluminescence. Notably, the chemiluminescence reaction was rapid, with a half&#8208;life of only&#160;0.86&#160;s,&#160;significantly faster than&#160;previously reported examples. Unlike conventional chemiluminescent scaffolds, the distinguishing feature of the chemiluminogenic&#160;iridium(III)&#160;complex is its&#160;unique intramolecular imine&#8208;to&#8208;amide conversion upon reaction with reactive oxygen species (ROS). Intriguingly,&#160;the chemiluminogenicity of these complexes is not influenced by the cyclometalating ligands but is&#160;closely associated with the Schiff base&#160;ligand, allowing for tuning of the emission colors via&#160;altering the cyclometalating ligands. Additionally,&#160;we formulated&#160;one of the Schiff base complexes&#160;(1) as water&#8208;soluble chemiluminogenic nanoparticles (CLNPs)&#160;and successfully&#160;employed&#160;them&#160;as activatable chemiluminescence bioprobes for&#160;precise and rapid&#160;imaging of hypochlorite&#8208;related biological events&#160;both in vitro&#160;and in vivo.&#160;We&#160;believe that this significant&#160;finding of the development of chemiluminogenic Schiff base&#160;complexes will greatly&#160;facilitate the designing&#160;of innovative chemiluminophores for theranostic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>H&#8208;Bonds in Carbon Quantum Dot&#8208;anchored C3N5 to Boost Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer for Piezoelectric&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Peroxide Synthesis under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuning proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) is a promising strategy to boost the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for H2O2 synthesis, but the slow transmission rate of protons and electrons to active sites remains a significant bottleneck. To address this, we developed an H&#8208;bond&#8208;driven PCET process based on carbon quantum dotanchored C3N5 (CQDs&#8208;C3N5) for piezo&#8208;catalytic H2O2 synthesis. CQD&#8208;C3N5 exhibited a remarkable piezo&#8208;catalytic synthesis rate of 5025 &#956;mol g&#8315;&#185; h&#8315;&#185; under ambient conditions. This efficiency is attributed to H&#8208;bonds between CQDs and C3N5, which accelerate PCET in the ORR. The piezoelectric&#8208;generated charges, from the dipole field of the C3N5 plane and protons in water, were rapidly transferred to the C rings of CQDs via H&#8208;bonds. This process facilitated the adsorption of oxygen onto C2 sites adjacent to carboxyl groups of CQDs, which in turn led to the formation of H2O2 through a rapidly protonated, indirect 2e&#8722; pathway. Additionally, a piezo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton reaction system was constructed for oxytetracycline&#8208;rich wastewater purification, with effectively effects on chemical oxygen demand, antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria and antibiotic&#8208;resistant genes degradation. This study highlights the critical role of H&#8208;bond networks for tuning PCET in the ORR and provides a comprehensive understanding for the precise control of catalytic reaction kinetics through molecular structural engineering.</dc:description>
