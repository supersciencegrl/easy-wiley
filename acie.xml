         <title>Altering the Symmetry of Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C by Axial Cl&#8208;Mediation for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst is acknowledged as a promising alternative for the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) towards cutting&#8208;edge electrochemical energy conversion/storage applications. Herein, a "Cl&#8208;mediation" strategy is proposed on Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C for modulating the catalyst's electronic structure towards achieving remarkable ORR activity. By coordinating axial&#8208;Cl atoms to iron phthalocyanine (FePc) molecules on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) matrix, a Cl&#8208;modulated Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C (FePc&#8208;Cl&#8208;CNTs) catalyst is synthesized. The as&#8208;prepared FePc&#8208;Cl&#8208;CNTs exhibit an improved ORR activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.91 V vs. RHE in alkaline solution, significantly outperforming the parent FePc&#8211;CNTs (0.88 V vs. RHE). The advanced nature of the as&#8208;prepared FePc&#8208;Cl&#8208;CNTs is evidenced by a configured high&#8208;performance rechargeable Zn&#8208;air battery, which operates stably for over 150 h. The experiments and density functional theory calculations unveil that axial&#8208;Cl atoms induce the transformation of FePc from its original D4h to C4v symmetry, effectively altering the electrons distribution around the Fe&#8208;center, by which it optimizes *OH desorption and subsequently boosts the reaction kinetics. This work paves ways for resolving the dilemma of Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts&#8217; exploration via engineering Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C configuration.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Atomically Precise Gold Nanoclusters for Selective Electroreduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electroreduction of greenhouse gas CO2 into high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals using renewable electricity is a promising way to mitigate climate change and realize carbon cycling. Atomically precise thiolate&#8208;protected gold nanoclusters have shown great potential for selective electrochemical conversion of CO2 towards CO due to their quantum confinement effect and unique electronic structures. Additionally, the atomic precision of gold nanocluster is advantageous for investigating the CO2 reduction mechanism, which is typically challenging to understand due to the complexity of the catalytic interface, and unknown structure of the active site in more conventional catalysts. By summarizing CO2 reduction catalyzed by gold nanoclusters, we aim to identify key factors that contribute to the activity, selectivity and stability of nanocluster catalysts, as well as elucidate the CO2 reduction pathway, thereby contributing to the design of more active and selective nanocluster catalysts for CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Solar&#8208;Driven Massive Production of Dimerized Imine in Aqueous Phase via an Atomically Engineered Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic selective oxidation of organics&#160;represents a promising avenue for the sustainable production of value&#8208;added chemicals, but suffers from sluggish charge separation and difficult selectivity manipulation. In particular, the Schottky barrier&#8208;induced adsorption of expected organic products at reduction sites tends to trigger the hydrogenation side reaction, which is more pronounced in the ideal aqueous environment due to distinct polarity. Here, we report a precise cocatalyst strategy on ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) photocatalyst at the atomic level to eliminate the Schottky barrier between ZIS and cocatalyst, thus achieving exceptional activity (565 &#956;mol h&#8722;1) and selectivity (99%) for photocatalytic dimerized imine production in aqueous media, which is five times more effective than ZIS loaded with Pt nanoparticles. The excellent performance is achieved by effectively attenuating the accumulation of photogenerated holes near the Pt sites and then suppressing the unwanted hydrogenation side reaction. We further demonstrate that our system can be directly scaled up to 0.5 m2 for scalable outdoor experiment and achieve solar&#8208;driven production of benzylimine with 125 mL yield and 97 wt% purity for two weeks under solar irradiation. This study presents an interfacial atomical design strategy for photocatalysts to efficiently produce high&#8208;value imine coupled with H2 under mild and green conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Divergent Total Syntheses of Cycloaurenones and Dysiherbols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cycloaurenones and dysiherbols are naturally occurring sesquiterpene quinones/quinols that share a 6/6/5/6 tetracyclic carbon skeleton with either a cis&#8208; or trans&#8208;decalin system containing four contiguous stereocenters, including three contiguous all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters. Total syntheses of cycloaurenones have not been reported. Herein, we present the first enantiodivergent syntheses of cycloaurenones and dysiherbols based on manipulation of a common cyclohexadienone intermediate: namely, a local desymmetric Giese&#8211;Baran&#8208;type cyclization for cycloaurenones and a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective conjugate addition for dysiherbols. Moreover, the key cyclohexadienone intermediate was readily accessible by a bidirectional approach from a chiral bis&#8208;Weinreb amide. The 1,4&#8208;nonadjacent stereocenters were installed by an unprecedented enantioselective hydrogenation of the corresponding bis&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated Weinreb amide (&gt;99:1 chiral/meso ratio, &gt;99% enantiomeric excess).</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Oxygen Vacancies with Atomically Dispersed Cu Sites for Stable and Efficient Photothermal CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photothermal catalysis under mild conditions represents a promising and sustainable approach for CO2 conversion into high&#8208;value chemicals, thereby enabling efficient carbon recycling. However, precise manipulation of active sites and their coordination environments at the atomic level to enhance catalyst performance still remains challenging. Here, we present a single&#8208;atom doping strategy for oxygen vacancy engineering to facilitate efficient CO2 conversion. Specifically, an In2O3&#8208;based catalyst with abundant oxygen vacancies induced by homogeneously dispersed Cu single atoms is constructed, exhibiting a competent CO2 reduction performance in photothermal reverse water&#8208;gas shift reaction. The optimal Cu&#8208;In2O3 catalyst achieves a CO yield rate of 46.17 mol&#183;gCu&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 with near&#8208;unity selectivity (&gt;99%) and demonstrates stability over 450 hours under 3 W&#183;cm&#8208;2 full&#8208;spectrum light illumination. Comprehensive spectroscopic characterization and computational simulations elucidate that the Cu single atoms synergistically interact with oxygen vacancies to promote H2 dissociation and CO2 activation under photoexcitation. This work provides insights into the design of photothermal catalysts, emphasizing the transformative potential of atomic&#8208;site engineering for efficient CO2 conversion and sustainable energy technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Built&#8208;in Electric Field via Balancing Interfacial Atom Orbit Hybridization at Boride@Sulfide Heterostructure for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring nonprecious metal&#8208;based catalysts for cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has facilitated the realization of hydrogen economy toward water electrolysis in alkaline media. However, the difficult water dissociation process for the Volmer step (H2O &#8594; H* + OH*) and the subsequent unsuitable OH* adsorption energy on nonprecious metal&#8208;based catalysts severely reduced the kinetics of HER. Herein, the universal synthesis for a series of transition metal (Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, and W)&#8208;based boride@sulfide heterostructured catalysts was realized by using molten&#8208;salt method to conduct the in situ boronization of commercial sulfides. Significantly, WB2@WS2 heterostructured catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activity and stability for HER. Balancing interfacial atom orbit hybridization between W(d)&#8208;B(s,p) and W(d)&#8208;S(s,p) at WB2@WS2 heterostructured interface enhances the built&#8208;in electric field. In situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory calculation results reveal that the built&#8208;in electric field in WB2@WS2 optimizes the adsorption and desorption of OH* intermediate, favoring the enhancement of catalytic performance toward HER. Besides, the rate&#8208;determining step over WS2, which is generally considered to be the Volmer step, was changed to the step of OH* desorption over WB2@WS2, and thus the corresponding energy barrier was decreased.</dc:description>

In situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory calculation results reveal that the built-in electric field in WB2@WS2 optimizes the adsorption and desorption of OH* intermediate, favoring the enhancement of catalytic performance toward HER. Besides, the rate-determining step over WS2, which is generally considered to be the Volmer step, was changed to the step of OH* desorption over WB2@WS2, and thus the corresponding energy barrier was decreased.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regioselective Hydrocyanation of Internal Alkynes Enabled by a Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Dual&#8208;Catalytic System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since its discovery in 1954, the hydrocyanation of multiple carbon&#8208;carbon bonds has emerged as a powerful strategy for the synthesis of nitriles. However, the elusive control of selectivity and typical reliance on expensive and toxic transition metal (TM) based catalysts significantly hinder the utility of this process. Here, we report an exclusively regioselective hydrocyanation of unbiased alkynes, driven by base&#8208;catalyzed reversible alkyne&#8208;allene isomerization and phosphine&#8208;catalyzed HCN transfer to the allene. This TM&#8208;free, dual&#8208;catalytic approach introduces a novel mode of selectivity control via regioselective hydrocyanation of the allene intermediate. The methodology secures a cost&#8208;effective access to a broad range of vinyl nitriles (40 examples) with yields up to 97% and Z/E stereoselectivity up to 20:1, including complex natural product derivatives. A comparison with TM&#8208;based systems highlighted a 2500&#8208;fold cost reduction, as well as the elimination of the troublesome separation of the regioisomers. Mechanistic studies elucidated the reaction pathway, shedding light on the achieved regioselectivity. By altering one catalyst in a dual&#8208;catalytic system, we demonstrated the regioselectivity switch, thereby facilitating regiodivergent hydrocyanation (8 examples). In a broader context, this approach offers a foundation for developing the next generation of TM&#8208;free strategies for the regioselective hydrofunctionalizations of unbiased alkynes.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Deep Eutectic Solvent Achieves Ultra&#8208;Low Polarization Zinc Anode Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy deep eutectic solvent (HEDES) is proposed as an electrolyte for rechargeable zinc metal batteries, reducing the polarization of deep eutectic solvents to a level comparable to that of aqueous electrolytes. HEDES inhibits side reactions and dendrite growth, and its aggregate&#8208;dominated solvation structure facilitates rapid interfacial ion transport, enabling long&#8208;term stable cycling performance.








Abstract
Deep eutectic solvents (DESs), a new class of green solvents, have emerged as promising candidates for electrolytes due to their exceptional electrochemical stability. However, the DES always exhibits unacceptable polarization of cells due to its high viscosity and low ionic conductivity, which limit its practical application in batteries. In this work, the cell polarization of DES is effectively reduced to a level comparable to that of pure aqueous electrolytes by increasing the entropy of DES via the disorder&#8208;making strategy of solvation structure. Theoretically, constructing the high&#8208;entropy deep eutectic solvent (HEDES) promotes the formation of more aggregates with high disorder, which accelerates mass transfer kinetics. As a result, the proposed HEDES (configuration entropy 17 times higher than traditional electrolyte) can achieve durable zinc plating/stripping behavior for more than 2000&#160;h with low polarization and still maintain good stability even in extreme environments. The cylindrical zinc&#8208;ion capacitor under gram&#8208;level loading can achieve a high discharge current up to 3 A, providing ideas for the design of electrolytes for zinc&#8208;based energy storage devices.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Driven Reversible Hydrogen Storage of Sodium Cyclohexanolate/Phenoxide Pair</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solar&#8208;driven reversible hydrogen storage of sodium cyclohexanolate/phenoxide pair demonstrated 99.9% conversion and selectivity in both hydrogenation and dehydrogenation via photocatalysis without external heating. The synergy between high&#8208; and low&#8208;frequency light enhances the overall performance, i.e., low&#8208;frequency light provides heat, while high&#8208;frequency light facilitates the desorption of product from the catalyst surface.








Abstract
Reversible hydrogen storage is a key challenge for the implementation of hydrogen energy, with dehydrogenation being particularly difficult because of its endothermic nature, slow kinetics, poor selectivity, etc. Solar energy&#8208;driven hydrogen uptake/release represents an interdisciplinary approach that provides an effective solution to those problems. Herein, we report the solar&#8208;driven reversible hydrogen uptake of 4.9&#160;wt.% over sodium cyclohexanolate/phenoxide pair, achieving over 99.9% conversion and selectivity in both hydrogenation and dehydrogenation via photocatalysis without external heating. Notably, the initial dehydrogenation rate reaches 23.4 mmolH2gcat&#8722;1h&#8722;1${\mathrm{mmo}}{{{\mathrm{l}}}_{{{{\mathrm{H}}}_2}}}{{{\mathrm{g}}}_{{\mathrm{cat}}}}^{ - 1}{{{\mathrm{h}}}^{ - 1}}$ that is ca. 2 orders of magnitude higher than thermocatalysis. The superior photocatalytic performance stems from the synergy between high&#8208; and low&#8208;frequency light, i.e., low&#8208;frequency light mainly provides heat, high&#8208;frequency light drives the desorption of product from the catalyst surface. This approach offers a path toward a sustainable solar&#8208;driven hydrogen energy system.

         <title>Ionized Water Facilitates the Sustainable Radical&#8208;Mediated Reduction of CO2 to Multi&#8208;Carbon Hydrocarbons and Oxygenates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation of water generates radicals (H2O&#8226;+, &#8226;OH, e&#8315;aq, &#8226;H) that reduce CO2 to C1&#9472;C6 hydrocarbons and oxygenates. e&#8315;aq activates CO2 into CO2&#8226;&#8315;, while &#8226;H enables hydrogenation. Oxidative radicals recycle oxygenates back into CO2&#8226;&#8315;, sustaining a sustainable network. This process demonstrates ionized water as a reactive matrix for abiotic organic synthesis. 








Abstract
The abiotic synthesis of organic compounds from CO2 and water under prebiotic conditions is a fundamental yet unresolved challenge in understanding the origins of life. Here we demonstrate a radical&#8208;mediated pathway for reducing CO2 to C1&#8210;C6 hydrocarbons and oxygenates driven solely by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation of water, mimicking early Earth environments. Using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), 17O/13C isotope labeling, and femtosecond transient absorption, we identify ionized water&#8208;derived radicals (H2O&#8226;+, &#8226;OH, e&#8315;aq, &#8226;H) as the key redox mediators. e&#8315;aq acts as a super&#8208;reductant (&#8722;2.9&#160;V) to activate CO2 into CO2&#8226;&#8315;, while &#8226;H enables sequential hydrogenation. Critically, oxidative radicals (H2O&#8226;+ and &#8226;OH) recycle recalcitrant oxygenates (formate and oxalate) back into active CO2&#8226;&#8315;, sustaining a dynamic radical network. This process generates a diverse library of organic compounds, including methane, ethylene, and C6 dimethyl succinate, via radical assembly mechanisms spanning hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer (HAT), self&#8208;coupling, and cross&#8208;coupling. By integrating experimental validation with prebiotic simulations (formate&#8208;mediated redox modulation), we resolve the paradox of inert CO2/H2 activation in primordial environments and establish water not merely as a solvent but as a reactive matrix directing abiotic organic synthesis.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;stable Gold Nanoparticles with Tunable Surface Characteristics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold nanoparticles, as a class of functional nanomaterials, have attracted considerable interest for biomedical applications owing to their unique chemical and physical properties. However, colloidal solutions of gold nanoparticles are thermodynamically unstable because of their high surface energy, resulting in poor stability and biocompatibility in physiological environments. Herein, we present a novel strategy for coating gold nanoparticles using in situ polymerization to form a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) network polymer shell around each particle. This approach enables the creation of ultra&#8208;stable core&#8208;shell structure that effectively improves biocompatibility and stability, even in complex biological environments.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Gold nanoparticles, as a class of functional nanomaterials, have attracted considerable interest for biomedical applications owing to their unique chemical and physical properties. However, colloidal solutions of gold nanoparticles are thermodynamically unstable because of their high surface energy, resulting in poor stability and biocompatibility in physiological environments. Herein, we present a novel strategy for coating gold nanoparticles using in situ polymerization to form a three-dimensional (3D) network polymer shell around each particle. This approach enables the creation of ultra-stable core-shell structure that effectively improves biocompatibility and stability, even in complex biological environments. The surface characteristics of the polymer shell can also be precisely tailored by carefully selecting the monomers to meet biomedical application requirements. These properties enable prolonged circulation within the bloodstream and enhanced tumor targeting in mice. This strategy offers an ultra-stable, aqueous-based, and biocompatible polymer shell for gold nanoparticles, paving the way for the surface modification of gold nanomaterials in biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regiospecific Halogenation Modulates Molecular Dipoles in Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers for High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, through regiospecific bromination on a helical 7H&#8208;dibenzo[c,g]carbazole&#8208;based SAM (CbzNaph) featuring a stronger dipole, we study the properties related to intrinsic stability, electrostatic potential (ESP) distribution, and changes in the molecular dipole of the derived SAM molecules. Bromination at the chemically inert sites of 7H&#8208;dibenzo[c,g]carbazole (JJ26) helps maximize molecular dipole while maintaining superior intrinsic stability. Together with the dense assembly promoted by enhanced intermolecular interactions and synergistic effects of stronger crystallinity, JJ26 efficiently modulates the work function (WF) of indium tin oxide (ITO) and enhances the stability of SAM under external pressure. The OSC device adopting JJ26 demonstrates significantly improved performance, achieving an efficiency of 19.35% along with notably enhanced stability. 








Abstract
Halogenated carbazole&#8208;derived self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) are promising hole&#8208;extraction materials in conventional organic solar cells (OSCs). While halogenation helps optimize the molecular dipole, intermolecular interactions, and energetics of SAM, the highly polarizable carbon&#8208;halogen bonds can be reactive and prone to photocleavage depending on their regiochemistry. Herein, we study the regiospecific properties, including the intrinsic stability, electrostatic potential (ESP) distribution, and changes in molecular dipole of the brominated SAM molecules by brominating a helical 7H&#8208;dibenzo[c,g]carbazole&#8208;based SAM (CbzNaph) featuring a stronger dipole. Additionally, a correlation between the intrinsic molecular stability and the derived SAM surface stability is established to determine the performance and stability of the OSCs. Notably, the bromination at the chemically inert sites of 7H&#8208;dibenzo[c,g]carbazole (JJ26) helps maximize molecular dipole while maintaining superior intrinsic stability. Together with dense assembly promoted by the synergistically enhanced intermolecular interactions and crystallinity, JJ26 can efficiently modulate the work function (WF) of indium tin oxide (ITO) and enhance the stability of SAM under external stress. Consequently, the JJ26 derived OSC shows significantly improved performance, achieving an efficiency of 19.35% along with notably enhanced stability. This work shows that the precise modulation of the regiochemistry of SAM molecules is critical for improving their quality and derived device performance.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview discussed the design, synthesis, and mRNA delivery properties of one&#8208;component ionizable amphiphilic Janus dendrimers (IAJDs), with particular focus on their organ targeted delivery properties. Other representative types of dendrimers including core&#8208;shell and dendron&#8208;tail dendrimers for RNA delivery have also been reviewed, demonstrating the versatility of dendrimer&#8208;type delivery carriers for RNA&#8208;related therapeutics.








Abstract
mRNA nanomedicine represents a new generation of therapeutics. However, how to deliver mRNA to the desired organs and cells effectively remains challenging. Common mRNA delivery vectors include viral and nonviral types such as four&#8208;component lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), polymer&#8208;based nanoparticles, lipid&#8208;polymer hybrid nanoparticles, and so on. One&#8208;component ionizable amphiphilic Janus dendrimers (IAJDs), are an emerging type of mRNA delivery vehicle displaying good stability and high delivery efficiency. In this review, we comprehensively present the design, synthesis, and mRNA delivery properties of IAJDs, with particular focus on the relationship between their molecular structures and organ targeted delivery properties. Other representative types of dendrimers for RNA delivery are also reviewed. Overall, this review summarizes the recent research progress on IAJDs systematically, aiming to guide the development of more efficient mRNA delivery platforms and next&#8208;generation mRNA nanomedicines.

         <title>Enhancing Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Anthraquinones via J&#8208;Type Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of acetylene spacers reduces the torsional angle of anthraquinone compared to the nonacetylene control compound (1.81&#176; versus 33.4&#176;). This adjustment in torsional connectivity facilitates J&#8208;type supramolecular polymerization in point&#8208;chiral anthraquinone luminophores, presenting a promising strategy for developing high&#8208;performance CPL materials through the simultaneous optimization of emission dissymmetry and quantum efficiency. 








Abstract
Circularly
polarized luminescence materials based on cost&#8208;effective point&#8208;chiral luminophores are highly desirable; however, their performance is often hindered by weak exciton&#8211;chirality coupling between the luminophore and its adjacent stereocenters. Here, we introduce J&#8208;type supramolecular polymerization as an effective strategy to address this challenge. By attaching amide groups to point&#8208;chiral anthraquinone luminophores, the formation of directional hydrogen bonds facilitates efficient chirality transfer from peripheral stereocenters to anthraquinones, resulting in supramolecular polymers with amplified chiroptical asymmetry. More importantly, the incorporation of acetylene spacers reduces torsional angle of the anthraquinone core compared to the nonacetylene control compound (1.81&#176; versus 33.4&#176;), promoting J&#8208;aggregation and increasing emission intensity. This structural optimization enables the supramolecular polymers to achieve a circularly polarized luminescence brightness of 13.8 M&#8315;&#185;cm&#8315;&#185;, marking a significant advancement in point&#8208;chiral luminophore systems. Furthermore, the integration of F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer into these supramolecular polymers allows for the fabrication of color&#8208;tunable circularly polarized electroluminescent devices. Overall, J&#8208;type supramolecular polymerization represents a promising approach for developing high&#8208;performance chiroptical materials by simultaneously optimizing emission dissymmetry and quantum efficiency.

         <title>Boron Doping&#8208;Induced Ultrahigh Ce3+ Ratio in Amorphous CeO2/GO Catalyst for Low&#8208;Concentration CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a novel strategy to synthesize amorphous CeO2/GO with an exceptionally high Ce3+ ratio of 85.7% through B&#8208;doping. The resulting amorphous structure reduces the band gap, enhances charge separation efficiency, and significantly boosts diluted CO2 photocatalytic activity. The material achieves remarkable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion rates of 249.33&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1(under 15% CO2) and 103.4&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1(under 1% CO2) with 100% selectivity, highlighting its potential for sustainable CO2 conversion. 








Abstract
Direct utilization of diluted CO2 enables sustainable CO2 conversion into valuable products, with reduced CeO2 emerging as an attractive candidate due to its exceptional redox flexibility. The catalytic efficacy of CeO2 is intimately tied to the electronic structure of 4f, yet the persistent challenge lies in maintaining a high and stable concentration of Ce3+. In this study, we propose a symmetry&#8208;breaking&#8208;induced amorphization strategy to achieve an exceptionally high Ce3+ ratio by B doping, which facilitates the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ in amorphous CeO2. First&#8208;principles calculations and infrared spectroscopy reveal that B doping with three excess electrons induces the formation of planar triangular B&#8211;O&#8323; units by disrupting the original high&#8208;symmetry Fm3&#175;m$Fm\bar 3m$ structure of CeO2, facilitating the spontaneous transition to the amorphous phase. Electronic structure analysis confirms that even a modest 7.5% B doping can significantly elevate the Ce3+ ratio to 85.7%. The resulting amorphous B&#8208;doped CeO2/GO shows a remarkable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion rate of 249.33&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1(under 15% CO2) and 103.4&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1(under 1% CO2), with 100% selectivity in both cases. This performance highlights how amorphization stabilizes defect states, making amorphous CeO2/GO with high Ce3+ an effective material for CO2 photoreduction and addressing key challenges in CO2 capture and utilization.

This performance highlights how amorphization stabilizes defect states, making amorphous CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/GO with high Ce&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; an effective material for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction and addressing key challenges in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture and utilization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Novel Tandem Reaction System for High&#8208;Concentration Acetic Acid Production from Methane and Oxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study developed a plasma&#8208;thermo&#8208;catalytic tandem system, optimizing plasma processes in a self&#8208;designed reactor to achieve 68.0% methane conversion and 5.2&#160;mol&#160;L&#8722;1 methanol concentration. A hydrophobic ReRh/ZSM&#8208;5&#8208;S catalyst minimized byproduct effects, enabling 52.0% acetic acid selectivity and 1.3&#160;mol&#160;L&#8722;1 concentration, three orders of magnitude higher than traditional methods, meeting industrial criteria and advancing efficient methane utilization. 








Abstract
Directly converting methane into high&#8208;value products like CH3COOH poses significant challenges owing to the kinetic limitations of C&#9472;H activation and C&#9472;C coupling in traditional single&#8208;catalysis methods. This work systematically studied the compatibility and effectiveness of plasma and thermocatalytic tandem systems. By optimizing the plasma process in a self&#8208;designed dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor, we enhanced methane conversion (68.0%), methanol concentration (5.2&#160;mol&#160;L&#8722;1), and CO selectivity (56.9%), while preventing carbon deposition and CO2 formation. In subsequent thermocatalysis, we developed the stearic acid&#8208;modified ReRh/ZSM&#8208;5&#8208;S hydrophobic catalyst to avoid the separation of methanol and CO from the mixture and minimize the influence of by&#8208;products (e.g., H2O). This innovative approach achieved 52.0% CH3COOH selectivity and 1.3&#160;mol&#160;L&#8722;1 concentrations, three orders of magnitude than traditional methods, meeting the preliminary industrial criteria. This study demonstrates the potential of tandem catalysis, offering valuable insights for the efficient utilization of methane and other challenging catalytic reactions.

         <title>Sprayed Microdroplets Architect a Polyoxometalate Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micron&#8208;sized droplets promote rapid nucleation of metal&#8208;oxo clusters, forming polyoxometalates within sub&#8208;millisecond timescales, an outcome unattainable in the bulk phase under similar conditions, while avoiding the traditional use of corrosive chemicals, acids, and heat.








Abstract
Although many past attempts have utilized micron&#8208;sized droplets for breaking and forming organic bonds, their potential in promoting inorganic bond formation reactions remains largely unexplored. We report a promising approach to synthesizing a tungsten&#8208;based Lindqvist&#8208;type polyoxometalate (POM) in various organic and aqueous microdroplets under ambient conditions, eliminating the traditional need for hazardous or corrosive chemicals and high&#8208;boiling solvents. When aerosolized, a simple tungstate (WO42&#8722;) solution spontaneously produces a metal&#8208;oxo cluster (W6O192&#8722;), a valuable POM with broad applications, achieving yields up to 99% in less than a millisecond. Mass spectrometric detection of reactive intermediates unraveled the nucleation mechanism in microdroplets, leading to the formation of polyoxotungstate, which was then further characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Empirical observations collectively suggest that rapid solvent evaporation and subsequent enrichment of reactants in the confined volume of microdroplets likely facilitate the growth of the POM through partial solvation at the air&#8211;liquid interface.

         <title>Predator&#8211;Prey Behavior of Droplets Propelling Through Self&#8208;Generated Channels in Crystalline Surfactant Layers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystalline layer is formed by an amphiphilic decylamine surfactant at the air/water interface. Aldehyde&#8208;containing ester oil droplets self&#8208;propel by consuming amines from the crystalline layer, thereby generating open channels along which myelin&#8208;forming amphiphile droplets chase and ultimately catch the aldehyde droplets in a predator&#8211;prey analogy.








Abstract
Motile droplets provide an attractive platform for liquid matter&#8208;based applications and protocell analogues displaying life&#8208;like features. The functionality of collectively operating droplets increases by the advance of well&#8208;designed (physico)chemical systems directing droplet&#8211;droplet interactions. Here, we report a strategy based on crystalline surfactant layers at air/water interfaces, which sustain the propulsion of floating droplets and at the same time shape the paths for other droplets attracted by them. First, we show how decylamine forms a closed, crystalline layer that remains at the air/water interface. Second, we demonstrate how aldehyde&#8208;based oil droplets react to decylamine in the crystalline layer by forming an imine, causing the droplets to move through the layer while leaving behind an open channel (comparable to &#8220;Pac&#8208;Man&#8221;). Third, we introduce tri(ethylene glycol) monododecylether (C12E3) droplets in the crystalline layer. The crystalline layer suppresses the motion of the C12E3 droplets, however, the aldehyde droplets create surface tension gradients upon depletion of surfactants from the air/water interface, thereby driving Marangoni flows that attract the C12E3 droplets as well as the myelin filaments they grow: Causing the C12E3 droplets to chase, and ultimately catch, the aldehyde droplets along the channels they have created, featuring a predator&#8208;prey analogy established at an air/water interface.

         <title>ATP&#8208;Assisted Electron and Proton Transfer Boosting Redox Metabolism&#8208;Induced Ferroptosis and Apoptosis for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vanadium and aurintricarboxylic coordination nanoparticles generate singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals specifically triggered by acidic H2O2 via dual&#8208;Russell reaction and Fenton&#8208;like reaction while depleting glutathione. Significantly, adenosine triphosphate induces VAP NPs aggregation, strengthens hydrogen&#8208;bonding network, and accelerates proton/electron transfer, thereby amplifying ROS level to co&#8208;activate ferroptosis and apoptosis.








Abstract
Compared to the intractability of traditional apoptosis, the vulnerability exposed by cancer cell metabolic reprogramming provides an advantage for ferroptosis treatment. Herein, we developed vanadate and aurintricarboxylic acid coordination nanoparticles (VAP NPs) that synergistically trigger dual cell death pathways. This nanoplatform leveraged dual&#8208;Russell mechanisms and Fenton reactions to generate singlet oxygen/hydroxyl radicals in the tumor microenvironment (TME) while depleting glutathione via vanadium redox cycling, thereby silencing glutathione peroxidase 4 and modulating the Kelch&#8208;like ECH&#8208;associated protein 1 (KEAP1)/nuclear factor erythroid 2&#8208;related factor 2 (NRF2)/heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) axis. Notably, TME&#8208;overexpressed adenosine triphosphate (ATP) acted as a biochemical catalyst, accelerating the transfer of protons and electrons during reactive oxygen species generation to amplify therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, VAP NPs could achieve outstanding efficacy for intrinsically stimulated synergy of ferroptosis and apoptosis in tumor therapy. This study provides reference for revealing the new function of ATP in enhancing the regulation of redox metabolism.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered Electrocatalytic Aldehyde Reforming Fuel Cell for Sustainable H2 Generation with ~200% Faradaic Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formaldehyde (HCHO), a promising yet enigmatic hydrogen carrier, presents both an intriguing opportunity and a formidable challenge to unlock its full potential of conversion and hydrogen (H2) generation while safeguarding environmental sustainability. This study rises to the challenge by pioneering a hybrid acid/alkali formaldehyde hydrogen production fuel cell (h&#8208;AAFHFC), an integrated system that integrates anodic partial electro&#8208;reforming of aldehydes at low potential with the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Formaldehyde (HCHO), a promising yet enigmatic hydrogen carrier, presents both an intriguing opportunity and a formidable challenge to unlock its full potential of conversion and hydrogen (H2) generation while safeguarding environmental sustainability. This study rises to the challenge by pioneering a hybrid acid/alkali formaldehyde hydrogen production fuel cell (h-AAFHFC), an integrated system that integrates anodic partial electro-reforming of aldehydes at low potential with the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The device introduces a new self-powered paradigm for H2 generation, featuring high Faradaic efficiency (FE), co-generation of electricity and acetate, and seamless synergy with renewable energy sources, all while achieving zero carbon dioxide emissions. The h-AAFHFC attains an open-circuit voltage of 1.11 V and a peak power density of 94 mW cm-2, enabling simultaneous H2 production at both electrodes with an extraordinary FE of approximately 200%. This breakthrough marks a transformative shift, moving from traditional electricity-driven systems to self-sustaining H2 generation. Our work lays the foundation for an eco-friendly, sustainable approach to H2 production, advancing the transition toward a carbon-neutral energy future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Scalable Preparation of Polyzwitterionic Hydrogels Based on Hydration Shielding&#8208;Accelerated Redox Self&#8208;Catalytic Polymerization (HS&#8208;A&#8208;RP)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional synthesis methods for polyzwitterionic hydrogels involve harsh conditions, such as thermal or UV irradiation, prolonged durations, and high monomer concentrations. Herein, we address these challenges at the meantime by proposing a novel chemical method, called hydration&#8208;shielding accelerated self&#8208;catalytic polymerization (HS&#8208;A&#8208;RP), facilitating the preparation of polyzwitterionic hydrogels. The discovery is that polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) chains can generate hydration shielding around hydrated zwitterionic monomers, promoting their effective aggregation and rapid crosslinking polymerization under the assistance of silver ions (Ag+)&#8208;potassium persulfate (S2O82&#8208;) redox catalyst. The HS&#8208;A&#8208;RP method performs under mild condition (&#8208;5&#8451; to 37&#8451;) without extra energy, overcomes the critical monomer polymerization concentration limitation (wt%: 0.3%), and completes within an ultra&#8208;short polymerization time (&lt;60 s). The prepared polyzwitterionic hydrogels possesses a denser network and superior mechanical properties compared to those prepared by traditional thermal/UV methods, exhibiting good anti&#8208;swelling behavior, excellent lubrication performance, and significant antibacterial and anti&#8208;fouling properties. These significant advances endow HS&#8208;A&#8208;RP with attractive application potentials in manufacturing functional hydrogel coatings for biomedical device, in situ encapsulation of thermally sensitive materials, and excellent sand fixation abilities. Moreover, HS&#8208;A&#8208;RP method is suitable for scalable manufacture and decorative coating of polyzwitterionic hydrogels on diverse substrates in extreme environmental conditions.</dc:description>

Entropy&#8208;driven competitive adsorption modulation in perovskite electrocatalysts enables hybrid conversion Zn&#8211;air batteries that couple sustainable energy storage and green chemical synthesis.








Abstract
Hybrid conversion Zn&#8211;air batteries (HC&#8208;ZABs) epitomize a typical integrated energy storage and conversion device that advances green chemistry and reduces carbon emissions. However, balancing efficiency and selectivity of electrocatalytic cathodic reactions remains the bottleneck in such batteries. Herein, we address this issue by designing a high&#8208;entropy perovskite, La0.6Sr0.1Ca0.1Rb0.1Y0.1CoO3 (HE&#8208;LCO), which outperforms conventional perovskites in offering enhanced electrocatalytic activity, better selectivity, and outstanding stability for cathodic benzyl alcohol oxidation reaction (BAOR). Combined spectroscopy characterizations, operando measurements, and theoretic calculations reveal that the entropy&#8208;driven modulation of the second coordination sphere in HE&#8208;LCO balances the adsorption of nucleophile benzyl alcohol and OH&#8722;, while inhibiting competing oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Based on this rationalized HE&#8208;LCO electrocatalyst, HC&#8208;ZABs realized efficient energy storage and benzoic acid production, boasting a long lifespan of 900 cycles at 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 6.7 mAh cm&#8722;2 per cycle. Further, practical ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;scale HC&#8208;ZABs demonstrated a 62.8% energy efficiency improvement and an average benzoic acid yield of 0.85&#160;g per cycle, highlighting the potential of this integrated device for simultaneous sustainable energy storage and green electrochemical synthesis.

         <title>Switchable Closed&#8208;Shell and Open&#8208;Shell Biradical States in Bis&#8208;Palladium Complexes of Tetrathiadodecaphyrin via Coordination Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis&#8208;Pd(II) complexes of a figure&#8208;eight tetrathiadodecaphyrin, featuring different coordination modes (NNCS&#9472;Pd versus NNCC&#9472;Pd) and electronic states (closed&#8208;shell versus open&#8208;shell biradical), have been prepared. The two complexes exhibit noteworthy photoacoustic (PA) response to the first and second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;I/II) range, respectively, and are interconvertible through a one&#8208;electron redox involving a reversible metal coordination rearrangement.








Abstract
A figure&#8208;eight tetrathiadodecaphyrin (1), featuring two porphyrin&#8208;like sub&#8208;pockets separated by central carbazolylenes was synthesized. Metalation of the thiaporphyrinoid ligand with Pd(OAc)2 produces two distinct bis&#8208;Pd(II) complexes with different coordination environments. Complex 2, adopting an {NNCS} metalation mode, exhibits a closed&#8208;shell electronic structure, whereas complex 3, with an {NNCC} coordination environment, exists as a ligand&#8208;centered organic biradicaloid with two magnetically independent spins (S&#160;=&#160;1/2). Biradical formation is attributed to single&#8208;electron transfer from each ligand sub&#8208;pocket to the Pd(II) center accommodated in a d8 square&#8208;planner coordination geometry. Notably, the complexes are interconvertible through doubly one&#8208;electron redox processes, demonstrating a reversible metal coordination rearrangement via thiophene ring flipping within a porphyrinoid framework. This work establishes the first example of such tunable metal coordination, offering a precise strategy for modulating closed&#8208;shell and open&#8208;shell biradical states. In addition, while complex 2 displays intense absorption and photoacoustic responses to the first near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;I) light in water after encapsulation within nanoparticles, the nanocomposites encapsulating biradicaloid 3 exhibits enhanced responsiveness in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) region.

         <title>Selective Leaflet&#8208;Anchored DNA Nanoprobes for Simultaneous Monitoring of Juxta&#8208;Plasma Membrane Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fusogenic nanoliposomes were developed to effectively anchor amphiphilic DNA tetrahedral probes onto the inner leaflet of the cell membrane. By combining this strategy with the direct anchoring of amphiphilic probes on the outer leaflet, precise functionalization of both membrane leaflets could be achieved, thereby enabling simultaneous monitoring of both the inner and outer juxta&#8208;plasma membrane environments. 








Abstract
The cell membrane functions as a bidirectional interface that coordinates the selective transport of substances and information between the interior and exterior of the cell. Simultaneous monitoring of both the inner and outer local environments surrounding this lipid bilayer is crucial for elucidating various cellular activities but significantly challenged by the lack of technologies capable of precisely engineering biosensing probes on both membrane leaflets. In this work, by developing fusogenic nanoliposomes with high cell fusion efficiency, we successfully anchored amphiphilic DNA tetrahedral probes onto the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. By integrating this with the direct anchoring of amphiphilic probes on the outer leaflet, we achieved precise functionalization of both leaflets of the cell membrane, thus enabling simultaneous monitoring of localized targets within their respective juxta&#8208;plasma membrane environments, avoiding signal contamination caused by the optical diffraction limit. Using selectively dual&#8208;leaflet&#8208;anchored tetrahedral DNAzyme probes, we revealed that the transmembrane ion channel SLC41A1 synergistically modulated the influx of Na+ and the efflux of Mg2+ in live cells. With a modular design, this membrane&#8208;anchored DNA nanoplatform can be readily extended for the study of bilateral interface&#8208;dominant cellular processes, shifting the paradigm toward a more localized and subtle perspective.

         <dc:description>The development of recyclable polymers presents a solution to the urgent issues of circular plastics economy. To this end, there is an increasing interest in expanding the utility of poly(disulfide)s, which contains dynamic covalent S&#8211;S bonds to enable intrinsic degradability. Lipoic acid and its derivatives represent the most widely used class of monomers for the preparation of poly(disulfide)s. However, their physical properties are usually on the soft side of thermoplastics and can face challenges in wider applications. In this contribution, we report a scalable synthesis of a new class of aryl&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;dithiolane monomers from biosourced phenol ethers and their ring&#8208;opening polymerization to aryl&#8208;substituted poly(disulfide)s. The aryl&#8208;substituted poly(disulfide)s display high recyclability without the cost of stability. The introduction of aryl side chains systematically improves the thermal properties of poly(disulfide)s. The optical properties of aryl&#8208;substituted poly(disulfide)s are competitive and so are the mechanical properties of the crosslinked network, showing potential for applications in sustainable materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrogen Peroxide Conversion Efficiency by Promoting the Two&#8208;Electron Water Oxidation Pathway via Modulating the Main Electron Transition Orbital</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photosynthetic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production involves coupling oxygen reduction and water oxidation half&#8208;reactions. However, the low efficiency of water oxidation constrains the overall solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen peroxide conversion efficiency under natural conditions. The two&#8208;electron water oxidation pathway holds potential for enhanced photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis, yet its regulatory mechanisms and detailed understanding remain inadequately explored. Herein, we construct donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) conjugated polymers with pyrene as the electron donor and triazine as the electron acceptor. By optimizing the connecting positions of the electron acceptors at the 2,7 positions of the electron donors, the main excited state is regulated from S1 to S2, leading to the electron transition from the lower HOMO&#8208;1 orbital. This modulation effectively enhances the oxidation capacity of the photocatalyst, enabling it to undergo two&#8208;electron water oxidation reaction (2e&#8722; WOR) for H2O2 production. Consequently, the WOR activity reaches a remarkable efficiency of 2560 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1, corresponding to a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) efficiency of up to 0.94%. This strategy of modulating electronic transition orbitals to enhance the water oxidation capacity of the material significantly improves photocatalytic performance and facilitates its application in natural environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Ribozyme&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;specific labeling of RNA using O6&#8208;alkylguanine SNAP&#8208;tag substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;specific modification of RNAs with functional handles enables studies of RNA structure, fate, function, and interactions. Ribozymes provide an elegant way to covalently modify an RNA of interest (ROI). Here, we report that the methyltransferase ribozyme MTR1 can be employed as a versatile tool for RNA modification and labeling. Using O6&#8208;alkyl guanine cofactors, designed in analogy to SNAP&#8208;tag substrates for protein labeling, MTR1 installs various bioorthogonal functional groups at N1 of a specific adenosine in the RNA target. In this application of ribozyme&#8208;catalyzed RNA labeling, MTR1 is now called SNAPR. In contrast to the self&#8208;labeling SNAP&#8208;tag which is appended to the protein of interest, SNAPR is a truly intermolecular RNA catalyst. SNAPR assembles with the ROI to the active ribozyme, allowing for the transfer of clickable tags, such as azide and alkyne moieties, as well as photolabile groups or cross&#8208;linkers from the guanine cofactor to the ROI. Moreover, we demonstrate a two&#8208;step approach to attach labels at N6 of the target adenosine: first, SNAPR generates N1A&#8208;modified RNA, followed by preparative Dimroth rearrangement to produce N6A&#8208;modified RNA. We demonstrate this strategy with p&#8208;azidobenzyl groups as photocrosslinker to generate covalent RNA&#8208;protein conjugates. Overall, this work expands the toolbox for site&#8208;specific RNA modification.</dc:description>

         <title>Multivariate Distribution Structured Anisotropic Inorganic Polymer Composite Electrolyte for Long&#8208;Cycle and High&#8208;Energy All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid polymer electrolytes are promising candidates for solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries owing to their favorable rheological properties and interfacial compatibility with cathodes and Li anodes. However, their limited ionic conductivity and low modulus lead to inferior electrochemical performance and dendrite growth. Herein, we developed a composite solid&#8208;state electrolyte comprising vermiculite sheets and a poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) matrix with multivariate distribution and an anisotropic structure. Within this assembly, some vermiculite sheets were suspended in the PVDF matrix to facilitate Li salt dissociation and Li+ transport, while others were tiled on the electrolyte surface, generating a dense, high&#8208;modulus Li2SiO3&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase via in&#8208;situ electrochemical reduction, which further improved interfacial kinetics and suppresses dendrite growth. As a result, a high conductivity of 1.38 mS cm&#8722;1 was achieved at room temperature, and the solid&#8208;state Li||Li cells displayed robust stability over 3000 h. The all solid&#8208;state LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2||Li full cells delivered a specific capacity of 172 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 C and 86% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 0.5 C. Additionally, practical cycle performance at a high loading (4.4 mAh cm&#8722;2) was achieved in pouch cells. Overall, multivariate distribution and anisotropic structuring offers a novel perspective for the preparation of high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Modulation of Interactions between Hydrophobic Tag&#8208;conjugated DNA Nanoprobes and Cell Membrane Facilitates ATP Imaging in the Tumor Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conjugating hydrophobic tags to oligonucleotides facilitates the swift and efficient creation of membrane&#8208;anchored DNA nanoprobes. However, the membrane&#8208;anchoring of these hydrophobic tag&#8208;conjugated DNA nanoprobes (HT&#8208;DNPs) lacks specificity among different cell types. To address this challenge, we herein report a conformational switching&#8208;based strategy for selectively anchoring HT&#8208;DNPs to target cells. In our design, HT&#8208;DNPs with extended or compact conformations possess weak or strong interactions with cell membrane, respectively. Thus, interactions between HT&#8208;DNPs and cell membrane can be dynamically controlled by altering the conformation of HT&#8208;DNPs. Initially, the extended HT&#8208;DNPs exhibit poor membrane&#8208;anchoring ability which is impute to their weak hydrophobic interactions with cell membrane. However, in slightly acidic conditions, HT&#8208;DNPs intercalated with DNA i&#8208;motif&#8208;forming sequences can fold into a compact conformation and exhibit strong hydrophobicity, thus achieving selective and efficient anchoring of HT&#8208;DNPs to target cells in such environments. Utilizing this method, we constructed HT&#8208;DNPs for imaging of ATP in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Our results indicate that these HT&#8208;DNPs can effectively accumulate at tumor sites for specific ATP imaging following intravenous injection. This strategy paves new avenues for the selective and efficient functionalization of target cells with various membrane&#8208;anchored DNA nanostructures, including DNA nanoprobes, DNA nanocircuits, and DNA nanomachines.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Co&#8208;Recycling: Selective Oxidation of Polyethylene to Dicarboxylic Acids over Spent LiCoO2 Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The escalating production of lithium&#8208;ion batteries and plastics poses critical challenges to environmental integrity and resource sustainability. Here, we report a synergistic co&#8208;recycling strategy for spent lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) cathodes and waste polyethylene (PE), leveraging the catalytic properties of LCO to oxidize PE into high&#8208;value dicarboxylic acids. Through a combination of density functional theory calculations, electron spin resonance, and in situ infrared spectroscopy, we reveal that lithium&#8208;deficient LCO undergoes a spin&#8208;state transition of Co3+ to a high&#8208;spin state, facilitating the activation of oxygen and the generation of singlet oxygen. This reactive oxygen species drives the selective oxidation of PE via hydrogen atom transfer, achieving dicarboxylic acid yields of up to 77.5 wt%, markedly exceeding previous benchmarks. Validation with real&#8208;world plastic waste and spent batteries underscores the feasibility of this approach, presenting a sustainable paradigm&#8208;shift solution for the efficient management of lithium&#8208;ion batteries and plastic waste in a circular economy.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Large&#8208;area Oriented Covalent Organic Framework Based PN Heterostructure Films to Enhance Artificial Photosynthesis of H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated covalent organic framework (COF) films exhibit enormous application potentiality in the photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), however, suffer from various photogenerated electron&#8208;hole recombination. Herein, we first report a new strategy of in&#8208;situ constructing oriented COF based PN heterostructure film through single&#8208;layer MoS2&#160;induced growth, significantly enhancing the photogenerated carrier separation efficiency, which promotes the photocatalytic H2O2&#160;synthesis. Experimental reveal that the as&#8208;made oriented TAPB&#8208;DMTA COF/MoS2&#160;(TAPB: 1,3,5&#8208;Tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl) benzene, DMTA: 2,5&#8208;Dimethoxyterephthalaldehyde) film exhibits a high&#160;photocatalytic H2O2&#160;yield of 8154 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8211;1&#183;h&#8211;1, which is ~2.5 times and ~4 times higher than that of non&#8208;oriented TAPB&#8208;DMTA COF films and powder. The mechanism reveals that the oriented structure of the TAPB&#8208;DMTA COF can significantly promote the generation and the transmission of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs along the skeleton and layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking direction, thus enhancing the photocatalytic H2O2&#160;performance. The new strategy of in&#8208;situ constructing oriented COFs&#8208;based PN heterostructure film for enhancing the photosynthesis of H2O2&#160;will open the door to rational design of molecular films towards high photogenerated carrier separation efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Hopping&#8208;type Charge Transport in Controllably p&#8208;doped Polaronic Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we find that controllable p&#8208;type doping leads to Holstein&#8208;type polarons in four electron&#8208;rich two&#8208;dimensional polymers (2DPs). Substoichometrically injecting holes into these 2DPs leads to small optical bandgaps (&lt;1.0 eV) and electrical conductivities (17 mS m&#8208;1) significantly higher than their undoped analogs. Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy and continuous&#8208;wave electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy both reveal that this arises from the formation of paramagnetic polarons. We achieve the maximal conductivities when 2DPs comprised of electron&#8208;rich nodes and electron&#8208;rich linkers are combined, which is a consequence of more delocalized polarons unveiled by diffuse&#8208;reflectance UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR spectroscopy. Variable&#8208;temperature electrical conductivity measurements reveal two distinct Arrhenius regimes in all 2DPs investigated, which we attribute to the different thermally activated processes inherent to in&#8208;plane and cross&#8208;plane electronic transport in stacked 2DP multilayers. This resulted in a maximum electronic conductivity of 326 mS m&#8208;1 at an elevated temperature. Collectively, this report provides fundamental insight into polaron&#8208;based charge&#8208;transport in p&#8208;type 2D organic layers, which we expect will form the foundation for the eventual deployment of these materials in electronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydride&#8208;Richest Molecular Complex: Ligand&#8208;Length Facilitated Cu40H38 Nanoclusters Exhibiting High Catalytic Performance for Selective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper hydride clusters are extensively studied for their significant potential catalysis. Although clusters with a high hydride content are particularly intriguing, they present considerable synthetic challenges. Herein, we report two copper hydride clusters, Cu18H16 and Cu40H38, which exhibit similar layered structures and components, albeit differing in size. The larger&#8208;sized Cu40H38 with more hydrides was achieved through ligand&#8208;length modulation by replacing 1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane (dppe) in synthesis of Cu18H16 with 1,5&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)pentane (dpppe). Cu40H38 is remarkable for i) the highest number of hydrides among known molecular compounds, ii) the highest number of unligated copper atoms and the highest metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratio in copper hydride clusters. Moreover, catalytic studies on the selective hydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds demonstrate that Cu40H38 is a promising catalyst and provide clear structural evidence that a less sterically hindered cluster surface, with a high metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratio, is beneficial for high&#8208;performance catalysis. The findings highlight the importance of surface composition and ligand coverage in catalytic efficiency and offer new avenues for designing high&#8208;performance copper hydride cluster catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Cation Modulation in Hybrid Zirconium Halides for High&#8208;Performance Flexible X&#8208;ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploiting novel materials featuring high&#8208;quality zero&#8208;dimensional structure, remarkable lattice stability, and minimal defects represents an efficacious strategy for enhancing the detection performance of X&#8208;ray scintillators. Here, we design and synthesize two novel, lead&#8208;free, zirconium&#8208;based zero&#8208;dimensional organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid metal halides (OIMHs), C14H40N4ZrCl8 and C6H16N2ZrCl6. Based on the steric hindrance effect of organic cations, the distance between [ZrCl6]2&#8208; polyhedra was designed and the electronic coupling interactions among polyhedra were adjusted, thus precisely engineering excellent zero&#8208;dimensional materials. Simultaneously, the stronger N&#8208;H+&#183;&#183;&#183;Cl&#8208; (interstitial) bond is introduced to avoid structural instabilities and more defects due to the bigger organic cation in C14H40N4ZrCl8. As expected, C14H40N4ZrCl8 exhibits more remarkable luminescence behavior compared to C6H16N2ZrCl6 when excited by UV light and X&#8208;rays. The photophysics process involving self&#8208;trapped excitons and defects is elaborately expounded using first&#8208;principles calculations, luminescence properties, and stabilities. Finally, a flexible and large&#8208;area scintillation screen with a size of up to 200&#215;100 mm2 based on C14H40N4ZrCl8 is fabricated and attains a high spatial resolution of 21.35 lp mm&#8208;1 and a lower limit of detection of 2.270 &#956;Gyair s&#8208;1, outperforming the resolution of most blue&#8208;emitting scintillation screens. These results imply that the zirconium&#8208;based OIMHs possess significant potential applications for medical diagnostics, security scanning, and non&#8208;destructive testing.</dc:description>

         <title>Vinyl&#8208;Functionalized Linear Alkyl Chains in Non&#8208;fullerene Acceptors Enable 19.2% Efficiency and Stable As&#8208;Cast Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficient and stable as&#8208;cast organic solar cells (OSCs) is imperative for alleviating costs and complexity for large&#8208;scale commercial applications. Nevertheless, achieving the desired double&#8208;fibril morphology of active layer through single&#8208;step processing is challenging. Herein, two non&#8208;fullerene acceptors, namely BTP&#8208;N6 and BTP&#8208;V6, are designed and synthesized to construct as&#8208;cast OSCs by introducing linear alkyl chains adjacent to the pyrrole moiety. The reduction of steric hindrance attributable to linear chains engenders diminished dihedral angles of molecular skeletons, thereby promoting compact and face&#8208;on oriented molecular stacking. Moreover, BTP&#8208;V6 featuring vinyl&#8208;functionalized linear chains manifests additional interaction sites with neighboring molecules to instigate enhanced &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking during rapid film&#8208;formation process, and engenders the formation of a refined double&#8208;fibril network morphology, which facilitates exciton dissociation, bolsters charge carrier transport, and suppresses recombination loss. Consequently, the D18:BTP&#8208;V6 based device attained a record&#8208;shattering efficiency of 19.2% with a high fill factor (FF) of 80.7%, and also demonstrated robust thermal and shelf stability. Moreover, the meticulously optimized layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) structured devices achieved an excellent efficiency up to 20.1%. This study introduces a viable strategy for alkyl chain modification to fabricate efficient and stable as&#8208;cast devices, with the anticipation of expediting the progression toward widespread commercialization of OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Acidic CO2 Electrolysis with Near&#8208;Ideal Selectivity and Carbon Efficiency Enabled by Overcoming Its Inherent Trade&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dioxide electroreduction (CO2R) in acid tends to be a promising route to avoid CO2 loss in alkaline and neutral electrolytes; however, high alkali cation concentrations (typically &#8805;3 M) are required to activate CO2 and suppress water electroreduction, causing carbonate formation and thus unsatisfied single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency (SPCE). Based on theoretical and experimental analyses, we show that an inherent trade&#8208;off exists: increasing cation concentrations improves Faradaic efficiency (FE) toward CO2R products but comes at the expense of reduced SPCE. We demonstrate a polyimide&#8208;modification strategy to overcome this trade&#8208;off by taking advantage of the amino groups that can effectively capture protons, creating local alkaline microenvironment surrounding the electrode surface. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment, SnO2 nanoparticles were modified with polyimide and acted as a CO2R catalyst, which achieved, simultaneously, near&#8208;ideal SPCE of 95.7% and FE of 96% (toward HCOOH) at pH 1.36 with dilute potassium ions down to even 0.1 M. We expect that these findings will accelerate the development of carbon&#8208; and electron&#8208;efficient acidic CO2 electrolysis.</dc:description>

Based on theoretical and experimental analyses, we show that an inherent trade-off exists: increasing cation concentrations improves Faradaic efficiency (FE) toward CO2R products but comes at the expense of reduced SPCE. We demonstrate a polyimide-modification strategy to overcome this trade-off by taking advantage of the amino groups that can effectively capture protons, creating local alkaline microenvironment surrounding the electrode surface. In a proof-of-concept experiment, SnO2 nanoparticles were modified with polyimide and acted as a CO2R catalyst, which achieved, simultaneously, near-ideal SPCE of 95.7% and FE of 96% (toward HCOOH) at pH 1.36 with dilute potassium ions down to even 0.1 M. We expect that these findings will accelerate the development of carbon- and electron-efficient acidic CO2 electrolysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Balancing CO2 Adsorption and H2 Activation on Confined ZnOx  Species for CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many oxide catalysts exhibit high selectivity but low conversion in CO2 hydrogenation due to strong CO2 adsorption, which often impedes H2 dissociation and subsequent hydrogenation. Herein, we report that a ZnCr2O4@ZnOx catalyst featuring monodispersed ZnOx overlayer confined on ZnCr2O4 facilitates CO2 activation without compromising H2 activation. This catalyst demonstrates a dual&#8208;site mechanism in which ZnCr2O4 surface and/or ZnOx/ZnCr2O4 interface provide sites for CO2 activation and monodispersed ZnOx promote homolytic H2 dissociation and formation of stable metal&#8208;H species, enabling formate formation through hydrogen spillover to CO2 adsorption sites for hydrogenation at 303 K. In contrast, H2 activation on ZnO or ZnCr2O4 suffers from the poisoning effect of strong CO2 adsorption. Consequently, the ZnCr2O4@ZnOx catalyst shows 2 &#8722; 8 folds enhancement in CO2 hydrogenation between 623 &#8722; 773 K than ZnO and maintains 33% conversion and 100% CO selectivity at 723 K over 150 hours. The established structure&#8208;performance relationship illustrates the critical role of dual&#8208;site catalysis and hydrogen spillover in hydrogenation reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytically Active Coacervates Sustained under Out&#8208;of&#8208;Equilibrium Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metabolically active membraneless organelles of extant biology have the capability to maintain their structure under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions by leveraging chemical reactions. Herein, we report active coacervates accessed via a mixture of minimal building blocks that featured &#960;&#8208;electron rich short peptide, positively charged aldehyde, and a cyclic ketone under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions. Peptide bound with the aldehyde by a dynamic covalent bond and demixed to form coacervates through hydrophobic interactions. Importantly, the short&#8208;peptide could utilize its free amine (&#946;&#8208;alanine) to catalyze C&#8208;C bond formation which eventually led to the depletion of one of the building blocks (aldehyde) via aldol reaction; an intrinsic catalytic role that helped the coacervate to suppress Ostwald ripening/coalescence. Notably, under continuous additions (open system) of the depleting precursors, the active coacervates were able to demonstrate spatial stability for longer duration.&#160; This out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium behavior of phase separated droplets in presence of flux of building blocks is reminiscent of the active membraneless organelles seen in contemporary biochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionally Tunable Star&#8208;Shaped Multivalent crRNAs for Photocontrol CRISPR/Cas Editing</title>

         <dc:description>Clustered regularly interspaced shortpalindromic repeats/CRISPR&#8208;associated (CRISPR/Cas)&#8208;based genome editing has significantly advanced genetic engineering due to its precision, simplicity, and versatility. &#160;However, achieving precise spatial and temporal control remains challenging, restricting therapeutic and research applications. &#160;Herein, we introduce a novel class of star&#8208;shaped, multivalent crRNAs engineered for precise spatiotemporal control of CRISPR/Cas9 and Cas12a editing systems. &#160;These crRNAs are synthesized via single&#8208;site chemical modification and can be efficiently purified. &#160;By integrating distinct photo&#8208;responsive chemical linkages, we achieved selective activation of crRNA activity upon irradiation with specific wavelengths, enabling orthogonal regulation of multiple genetic targets simultaneously. &#160;This method demonstrated robust OFF&#8208;ON switching capabilities in vitro, characterized by minimal leakage and rapid activation. &#160;Importantly, the approach also proved highly effective for temporally controlled gene editing in mammalian cells in vivo, achieving considerable editing efficiency following brief photoactivation. &#160;Due to its target sequence&#8208;independent, single&#8208;site modification design, this strategy may serve as a universal solution for diverse CRISPR/Cas systems, eliminating cumbersome optimization processes. &#160;Future advancements incorporating long&#8208;wavelength responsive and reversible linkers promise further enhancement of tissue penetration and control, significantly broadening the applicability and impact of this approach in biological research and therapeutic interventions.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction on Cobalt&#8208;Based Perovskite via Regulating Reaction Pathway through Donation&#8208;Back&#8208;Donation Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrocatalytic approach of combining N2 and H2O to produce ammonia, known as the electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (eNRR), has garnered significant attention due to its environmental benefits and potential for supporting a decentralized agricultural economy. However, the underlying chemistry governing the reaction pathways remains poorly understood, hindering the design of low&#8208;cost and efficient eNRR catalysts. Here we report the enhancement of the electrocatalytic eNRR activity of perovskite oxides by tuning the reaction pathway through a &#8220;donation&#8208;back donation&#8221; mechanism. This is achieved by controlling the spin state via adjusting the distribution of d orbital electrons in low&#8208;cost transition metals, such as cobalt. Specifically, the cobalt in perovskite SrCoO3 (SC) with a low&#8208;spin state demonstrates an 18 times higher ammonia yield rate compared to that in Co3O4 and 1.5 times higher than cobalt in perovskite LaCoO3 (LC). The low spin states of cobalt in SC enable better control of the eNRR reaction pathway over the transformation of *N2H to *NHNH or *NNH2, resulting in alternating hydrogenation in SC rather than distal hydrogenation in LC with a high spin state. The unprecedented improvement in eNRR by regulating the spin state of Co demonstrates the bright of low&#8208;cost Co&#8208;based electrocatalysts for ammonia production.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox Catalysts Based on N&#8208;(Hexyl)benzothioxanthene&#8208;3,4&#8208;dicarboximide for Photopolymerization and 3D Printing under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoredox catalytic systems are widely used in free radical polymerization as an important photoinitiating approach. However, many reported photoredox catalytic systems are limited by their low stabilities, high excitation powers, and low initiating efficiencies upon excitation in the visible region. Therefore, it is still a great challenge to develop efficient photoinitiating systems for photopolymerization under visible light. In this work, three new effective photosensitizers from N&#8208;(hexyl)benzothioxanthene&#8208;3,4&#8208;dicarboximide derivatives namely 2&#8208;hexyl&#8208;1H&#8208;thioxantheno[2,1,9&#8208;def]isoquinoline&#8208;1,3(2H)&#8208;dione (BTXI), 5&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;hexyl&#8208;1H&#8208;thioxantheno[2,1,9&#8208;def]isoquinoline&#8208;1,3(2H)&#8208;dione (BTXI&#8208;Br) and 2&#8208;hexyl&#8208;1H&#8208;thioxantheno[2,1,9&#8208;def]isoquinoline&#8208;1,3(2H)&#8208;dione 6,6&#8208;dioxide (BTXIO), were designed by density functional theory calculation and synthesized as photoredox catalysts for visible light induced photopolymerization. When combined with initiators such as oxidants i.e. bis(4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl)iodonium hexafluorophosphate or sulfonium salts (i.e., thianthrenium salts, phenoxathiinium salt, phenothiazinium salt, dibenzothiophenium salt) and the reductant ethyl dimethylaminobenzoate to form three&#8208;component initiating systems, they showed good to high performance in visible light photo polymerizations with LED@405nm and LED@450nm. In addition, these photoinitiating systems enable the successful digital light processing and direct laser writing of 3D structures with high resolution, demonstrating a promising strategy for 3D printing applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Vacancy and Dopant Co&#8208;Constructed Active Microregion in Ru&#8211;MoO3&#8722;x/Mo2AlB2 for Enhanced Acidic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Ru&#8208;doped low crystalline&#8208;crystalline MoO3&#8722;x/Mo2AlB2 hybrid material was designed. The region containing Ru atom and/or O vacancy is innovatively defined as the active microregion. The Ru&#9472;O&#9472;Mo bonds with shorter bond lengths provide satisfactory preconditions for the electronic structure modulation of O atoms.

Accurate identification of catalytic active regions is crucial for the rational design and construction of hydrogen evolution catalysts as well as the targeted regulation of their catalytic performance. Herein, the low crystalline&#8208;crystalline hybrid MoO3&#8722;x/Mo2AlB2 with unsaturated coordination and rich defects is taken as the precursor. Through the Joule heating reaction, the Ru&#8208;doped MoO3&#8722;x/Mo2AlB2 catalyst is successfully constructed. Building on the traditional view that individual atoms or vacancies act as active sites, this article innovatively proposes the theory that vacancies and doped atoms synergistically construct active microregions, and multiple electron&#8208;rich O atoms within the active microregions jointly serve as hydrogen evolution active sites. Based on X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analysis and first&#8208;principles calculations, there is a strong electron transfer among Ru atoms, Mo atoms, and O atoms, leading to extensive O atoms with optimized electronic structure in the active microregions. These O atoms exhibit an H* adsorption free energy close to zero, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution. This work provides a brand&#8208;new strategy for the design and preparation of electrocatalytic materials and the systematic regulation of the local electronic structure of catalysts.

         <title>Nitrogen Insertion via Asymmetric Condensation and Chirality Transfer: A Stereodivergent Entry to Cyanocyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of cyanocyclopropanes is achieved via asymmetric nitrogen insertion into prochiral cyclobutanones. Key mechanistic steps involve an organocatalyzed asymmetric condensation followed by chirality transfer via an intercepted Neber rearrangement. The reaction can be conducted in a one&#8208;pot, stereodivergent manner, allowing access to all possible cyclopropane isomers with precise control of stereochemistry.








Abstract
The condensation of prochiral cyclobutanones and diphenylphosphinyl hydroxylamine is achieved under Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis. Interestingly, the competing aza&#8208;Baeyer&#8211;Villiger reaction is completely suppressed and the axially chiral oxime esters can be isolated in excellent yield and selectivity (up to 96% yield, up to 97:3 er). Computational analysis highlights the crucial role of the Br&#248;nsted acid in facilitating a successful condensation. Building on the inherent reactivity of the corresponding oxime esters, a one&#8208;pot protocol toward cyanocyclopropanes was discovered, which establishes two consecutive stereocenters. This unusual ring contraction is triggered by strong base and permits an axial&#8208;to&#8208;point chirality transfer with good enantiospecificity (up to 98% es). Fine&#8208;tuning the reaction parameters enables stereodivergent access to both diastereomers of the cyanocyclopropanes, and the utility of this method is demonstrated through the formal synthesis of the drug tasimelteon.

         <title>Self&#8208;Compartmented Electrolyte Design for Stable Cycling of Lithium Metal Batteries under Extreme Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;compartmented electrolyte: A novel electrolyte concept utilizing LiTDI enables a high&#8208;concentration, anion&#8208;rich interfacial region and a low&#8208;concentration bulk electrolyte. This unique design simultaneously enhances interfacial stability and ion transport kinetics in high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Electrolyte is the key component dictating lithium battery performance, especially under extreme conditions such as fast cycling and low temperatures. However, conventional electrolyte design principles, which generally rely on a homogeneous mixture of solvents, salts, and functional additives, fail to simultaneously meet the requirements for both anodic/cathodic interfacial stability and bulk ion&#8208;transport kinetics in lithium metal batteries. Herein, we present a self&#8208;compartmented electrolyte design methodology. Lithium 4,5&#8208;dicyano&#8208;2&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;ide (LiTDI), featuring the ability to selectively self&#8208;assemble on the cathode/electrolyte interface, compartmented the electrolyte into a heterogonous one. Close to the cathode side, LiTDI could induce an interfacial high&#8208;concentration region, where the anion&#8208;rich solvation structure facilitates the formation of a stable cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase (CEI). In the bulk, the electrolyte maintains a low concentration with low viscosity, ensuring fast ion transport and superior rate performance. Li||NCM811 cells achieve over 500 stable cycles with 80.3% capacity retention and deliver 169.3&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at a 10C discharge rate. Under low&#8208;temperature conditions (&#8722;20&#160;&#176;C), the cells maintained outstanding stability over 700 cycles at 0.5C charge/discharge, achieving capacity retention of 96.6% and an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.2%. This work provides a new electrolyte design paradigm, addressing the critical challenges of LMBs for high&#8208;voltage and low&#8208;temperature applications.

         <title>Mn(II)&#8208;Based Hybrid Halide Ionogel Scintillator Film for Large&#8208;Area and High&#8208;Resolution X&#8208;ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a versatile approach for the rapid synthesis of luminescent Mn(II)&#8208;based hybrid halide ionogels (Mn&#8208;IG) by in situ forming zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid metal halides during monomer polymerization. The Mn&#9472;IG exhibits high transparency (with transmittance approaching 90% at 550&#8211;1100&#160;nm) and uniform, high&#8208;efficiency emission. Leveraging its processability, we have fabricated an 18&#160;cm&#160;&#215;&#160;12&#160;cm scintillating film and successfully achieved large&#8208;area and high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging. This simple and rapid synthesis method on ionogels paves the way for the low&#8208;process preparation of large&#8208;area scintillators and also opens up a new avenue for the in situ construction of uniform 0D halide&#8208;polymer composites.








Abstract
Functionalized ionogels have attracted significant attention in chemical design of new materials and versatile applications, which are formed by polymer network as a matrix with introducing ionic liquids containing characteristic units as a dispersion medium. Here, we present an universal scheme to rapidly synthesize luminescent ionogels through the in situ formation of zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid metal halides during the polymerization of monomer. In particular, Mn(II)&#8208;based hybrid halide ionogels (Mn&#9472;IG) were formed by incorporating [C20H20P]+ cations and [MnBr4]2&#8722; anions into the polymer network structure. Thanks to the amorphous nature of Mn&#8208;IG and the homogeneous distribution of self&#8208;trapped [MnBr4]2&#8722; light&#8208;emitting units with [C20H20P]+ cations, Mn&#9472;IG exhibits high transparency (nearly 90% transmittance at 550&#160;nm&#8208;1100&#160;nm) and homogeneous highly&#8208;efficient emission. Taking advantage of its processability, we fabricate an 18&#160;cm&#160;&#215;&#160;12&#160;cm scintillation film and successfully realize large&#8208;area and high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging.

         <title>Tailoring One&#8208;Dimensional Assemblies of Chiral Bowl&#8208;Shaped Molecules with Diverse Enantiomers and Polar Column Alignments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Given that chiral bowl&#8208;shaped &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules are stacked straight forming a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) assembly, eight assemblies with different symmetries can be considered. In this study, seven of eight assemblies are selectively synthesized with minimal alternations in their molecular structures. These assemblies will be useful for the quantitative discussion for structure&#8211;property relationship.







Abstract
Symmetry is an important factor in material design. Generally, it is difficult to quantitively discuss symmetry&#8208;property relations. Two materials only with symmetry differences are requisite to verify whether polar or nonpolar chiral systems are advantageous for a specific property/phenomenon, such as chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity. However, it is difficult to selectively prepare materials having different symmetries without changing other physical properties. The current study successfully prepared seven exceptionally similar crystals with different symmetries in terms of polarity, chirality, and enantiomer alignments, which affords ideal materials for the abovementioned studies. Furthermore, we revealed a universal guiding principle on the self&#8208;assembly pattern of bowl&#8208;shaped molecules to predict the resultant assembled structures with the help of molecular dynamics simulations.

&lt;p&gt;Symmetry is an important factor in material design. Generally, it is difficult to quantitively discuss symmetry-property relations. Two materials only with symmetry differences are requisite to verify whether polar or nonpolar chiral systems are advantageous for a specific property/phenomenon, such as chirality-induced spin selectivity. However, it is difficult to selectively prepare materials having different symmetries without changing other physical properties. The current study successfully prepared seven exceptionally similar crystals with different symmetries in terms of polarity, chirality, and enantiomer alignments, which affords ideal materials for the abovementioned studies. Furthermore, we revealed a universal guiding principle on the self-assembly pattern of bowl-shaped molecules to predict the resultant assembled structures with the help of molecular dynamics simulations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

We report the first bis(pinacolato)diboron&#8208;enabled Ni&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and enantioselective reductive [3&#160;+&#160;2] annulation of &#946;&#8208;bromoenones with alkynes, providing convenient access to synthetically valuable chiral five&#8208;membered cyclic tertiary alcohols via axial chirality transfer to central chirality. A broad substrate scope, late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules, and diverse transformations highlight the utility of this reaction.








Abstract
Chiral five&#8208;membered cyclic tertiary alcohols are important structural motifs in functional materials, pharmaceuticals, and bioactive molecules. Hence, developing efficient methodologies for synthesizing compounds featuring these privileged scaffolds represents a crucial pursuit within synthetic chemistry. Herein, we present a regio&#8208; and enantioselective Ni&#8208;catalyzed strategy for the reductive [3&#160;+&#160;2] annulation of &#946;&#8208;bromoenones with alkynes, providing convenient access to chiral five&#8208;membered cyclic tertiary alcohols with high levels of regio&#8208;, and enantioselectivity via axial chirality transfer to central chirality. The utilization of an environmentally sustainable bis(pinacolato)diboron (B2pin2) is crucial for the success of this asymmetric reductive cyclization reaction. Simultaneously, the mild reaction environment greatly enhances functional group compatibility. This has been demonstrated by the broad substrate scope, late&#8208;stage functionalizations of bioactive compounds or drug molecules, and subsequent transformations. Amongst, it is worth emphasizing that these functionally enriched chiral five&#8208;membered cyclic tertiary alcohols can efficiently participate in Diels&#8211;Alder reactions to synthesize enantioenriched polycyclic and heterocyclic molecules, thereby further validating the significance of introducing a cyclopentadiene skeleton. The preliminary mechanistic studies revealed the mode of action of B2pin2 in mononuclear Ni&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reductive [3&#160;+&#160;2] annulation reactions and density functional theory (DFT) calculations clarified the origin of the experimentally observed regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Based Signal Circuit for Self&#8208;Regulated Bidirectional Communication in Protocell&#8208;Living Cell Communities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intercellular communicating protocell with feedback loop was designed for self&#8208;regulating signal transmission in protocell/living cell community. This DNA&#8208;empowered protocell provides a bottom&#8208;up access route toward synthetic cellular systems with abilities for programming desired cellular behaviors.








Abstract
Developing synthetic biology tools to control cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell signaling can provide new capabilities to engineer cell&#8208;cell communication and program desired cellular behaviors. As cell mimics, abiotic protocells provide an attractive opportunity to modulate the intercellular communication with design&#8208;based regulatory features. Despite the chemical communication of protocells that interact with living cells have been demonstrated, the autonomous regulation of intercellular signal transmission in protocell/living cell community remains a critical challenge. Herein, we designed a DNA circuit consisting of a recognition module, activation module, and feedback module that enables protocells to self&#8208;regulate the interaction with living cells by sensing and responding to the signal released from living cells. The feedback module with renewable capability is capable of processing the signal transduction on the membrane surface of protocells and controlling intercellular adhesion. Once dissociated from living cells, the disengaged protocells allow the following interaction with multiple target living cells in succession. Overall, this work provides an avenue to control and program dynamic signal propagation in protocell/living cell community. The designed communication with living cells would open new ways to tune cellular behavior and apply them to cell&#8208;based therapeutics.

         <title>A Powerful Regulator to Enhance Electrocatalytic Reaction Kinetics and Thermodynamics: The Ordered Hetero&#8208;Nanowire</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ordered hetero&#8208;nanowire (NW) regulator is presented, which simultaneously couples the merits of the kinetics and thermodynamics in electrocatalysis. The periodical arrangement enables the formation of the local electric field to improve mass transfer kinetics, accounting for a significant boost in MOR performance. In addition, the hetero&#8208;NWs undergo the energetically favorable non&#8208;CO pathway, which is not susceptible to the invasion of toxic carbonaceous intermediates and thus ensures long&#8208;term durability for MOR.








Abstract
Optimizing the thermodynamics of electrode reactions is a valid strategy for achieving superior electrocatalysts for direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). However, as the catalyst downsizes to the nanoscale, the influence of mass transfer kinetics is pronounced in improving electrocatalytic activity. Herein, an ordered hetero&#8208;nanowire (NW) regulator that couples the virtues of kinetics and thermodynamics is reported. Finite element analysis demonstrates that the periodic arrangement of hetero&#8208;NWs could construct a uniform electric field, promoting the precise mass transfer of reactant molecules and accelerating the electrode reaction kinetics for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). In addition, the microscopic electronic structure effect of the well&#8208;defined catalyst weakens the bonding interaction toward toxic carbonaceous intermediates, which meanwhile strengthens the adsorption of hydroxyl species, critically contributing to enhanced MOR durability. The wide generality of this regulator has been confirmed by a series of as&#8208;prepared ordered hetero&#8208;NW catalysts, which show prominent electrocatalytic performance, including relatively high mass activity, superior CO resistance, and long&#8208;term stability. Therefore, this work reveals the importance of the tandem effect of kinetics and thermodynamics in electrocatalysis, which provides valuable insights for developing customized and highly efficient catalysts for extensive applications.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling of Arylthianthrenium Salts with (Hetero)aryl (Pseudo)halides via Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing complex arylthianthrenium salts and readily available (hetero)aryl (pseudo)halides as starting materials, in conjunction with hypoboric acid as a reductant, structurally diverse (hetero)biaryl motifs can be rapidly synthesized via palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction. Key to this advance is the selective and mild borylation of arylthianthrenium salts, followed by a conventional SMC (Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling) reaction with aryl halides.








Abstract
Herein, we present a cross&#8208;coupling reaction of arylthianthrenium salts at a late stage with diverse (hetero)aryl (pseudo)halides under reductive conditions, in which a palladium(0) catalyst differentiates between two aryl electrophiles based on the different rates of oxidative addition of arylthianthrenium salts and aryl halides for selective umpolung. A measured near&#8208;zero Hammett rho value is consistent with oxidative addition of the arylthianthrenium salts to palladium(0) being insensitive to substituent effects, which enables reaction with structurally and electronically diverse arylthianthrenium salts. In addition, we show the robustness of this method by coupling of two complex fragments that would otherwise be difficult to access in a single step.

         <title>Structurally Engineering Multi&#8208;Shell Hollow Zeolite Single Crystals via Defect&#8208;Directed Oriented&#8208;Kinetics Transformation and Their Heterostructures for Hydrodeoxygenation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;crystalline multi&#8208;shell hollow porous materials with high compartment capacity, large active surface area, and superior structural stability are expected to unlock tremendous potential across diverse critical applications. However, their synthetic methodology has not yet been well established. Here, we develop a defect&#8208;directed oriented&#8208;kinetics transformation approach to prepare multi&#8208;shell hollow aluminosilicate ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite (MFI) crystals with single&#8208;crystalline feature, hierarchical macro&#8208;/mesoporosity, controllable shell number, and high structural stability. The methodology lies in the creation of zeolite precursors consisting of multiple inhomogeneous layers with gradient&#8208;distributed defects along the [100] and [010] directions and irregularly discrete defects&#8208;rich regions along the [001] direction via continuous epitaxial growth. Subsequently, the locations with more defects could be preferentially etched to form voids or mesopores, meanwhile oriented recrystallization interconnects the nanoshells into a unified architecture along the [001] direction. Benefiting from the easily accessible bifunctional metal/acid sites and the capability for reactant accumulation, the resultant multi&#8208;shell hollow Ni&#8208;loaded zeolite catalysts show significantly enhanced catalytic activity in the hydrodeoxygenation of stearic acid into liquid fuels. The insight gained from this systematic study will facilitate the rational design and synthesis of diverse multi&#8208;shell hollow structured single&#8208;crystalline porous materials for a broad range of potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Stepwise Crystallization Synthetic Strategy for Monodisperse InSb Colloidal Quantum Dots with Mid&#8208;Infrared Absorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Colloidal InSb quantum dots (QDs) are promising mid&#8208;infrared (MIR) photodetection materials due to their suitable bandgap, unparalleled room temperature electronic properties, environmental&#8208;friendly elemental composition and facile solution processability. However, current InSb QDs suffer from limited spectral absorption within 2 &#956;m, polydisperse QDs populations and complex size&#8208;selective precipitation for further use, due to the lack of applicable growth theory and synthetic method. Here, we present a novel synthetic strategy for InSb QDs, which is featured by the initial formation of an amorphous intermediate and a subsequent stepwise crystallization process. This strategy enables the achievement of monodisperse InSb QDs with unprecedented 5.8 nm to 22.2 nm size range, and a remarkably low size distribution deviation of 5.8% without the need of any size&#8208;selective precipitation. For the first time, we realize the synthesis of InSb QDs with absorption wavelength exceeding 3000 nm, the record among the environmental&#8208;friendly QDs. The results presented here will pave the way towards environmental&#8208;friendly QDs as outstanding infrared optical and optoelectronic materials and push the frontier of solution&#8208;processed QDs into the mid&#8208;infrared regime applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Benchmark Paraffin Adsorption in a Super&#8208;Hydrophobic Porous Coordination Polymer with Blade&#8208;like Circular Phenyl Nanotraps</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective capture of paraffin from olefin that permits one&#8208;step purification of olefin is significantly important, yet developing adsorbents with high separation selectivity and hydrophobicity remains a daunting challenge. Although aromatic environments can enhance paraffin affinity and hydrophobicity through nonpolar interactions, water adsorption still occurs in regions distant from the aromatic rings, as well as in secondary pores that are always overlooked. Herein, we reported an ultramicroporous porous coordination polymer (ZnFPCP) featuring blade&#8208;like circular phenyl paraffin nanotraps. As further validated by DFTB calculations, GCMC simulations, and in situ FT&#8208;IR analysis, these ultramicroporous paraffin nanotraps created by surrounding benzene rings enhance the preferential adsorption of paraffin, and the segmented spaces between adjacent nanotraps in the blade&#8208;like structure combined with hydrophobic petal&#8208;like secondary pore channels enclosed by fluorinated functional groups further mitigates the water co&#8208;adsorption. Remarkably, ZnFPCP exhibited outstanding IAST selectivity of C3H8/C3H6 (2.08) and competitive selectivity of C2H6/C2H4 (2.93) under ambient conditions, while also exhibiting record&#8208;breaking C3H8 and C2H6 uptake at low pressures. Breakthrough experiments demonstrated the excellent performance of ZnFPCP in olefin purification, affording the exceptional productivity of ultra&#8208;high purity (99.99%) for C3H6 and C2H4. Robust stability and super hydrophobicity highlight its potential in harsh industrial application scenarios.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Catalytic Potential of Facet Heterojunctions in Platinum Alloys for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transition of octahedral PtNi nanoparticles (NPs) to a truncated structure enriches the diversity of catalytic sites. The edge sites, featuring facet heterojunctions, leverage geometric and ligand synergies to enhance the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and optimize the adsorption of oxygenated intermediates, leading to superior performance in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs).








Abstract
Ensuring high&#8208;quality activity of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) while mitigating the degradation of Pt&#8208;based alloy catalysts remains challenging. A platinum&#8208;skinned truncated octahedral PtNi alloy with (100)/(111) facet heterostructures is synthesized through a low&#8208;temperature thermally driven etching strategy, demonstrating exceptional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and stability. The heterostructure of the Ptskin&#8208;PtNi(111) facet destabilizes the *OOH intermediate and promotes the preferential O&#9472;O bond cleavage, leading to the optimization of ORR pathway. A linear correlation between the generalized coordination number (CN&#175;$\overline {{\mathrm{CN}}} $) and &#916;G*OH demonstrates that the facet hetero&#8208;sites optimize the adsorption of *OH to the theoretically optimal state through ligand and geometric effects. The optimized PNZC&#8208;5A160 catalyst exhibits enhanced ORR activity (2.97 A mgPt&#8722;1 at 0.9&#160;V vs. RHE) and superior H2&#8208;O2 single PEMFC performance [mass activity (MA) of 0.5 A mgPt&#8722;1 at 0.9 ViR&#8208;free; peak power density of 1.42&#160;W cm&#8722;2, exceeding the U.S. Department of Energy 2025 targets. After accelerated stress tests, the loss in MA at 0.9 ViR&#8208;free and in potential at 0.8 A cm&#8722;2 is only 8% and 3.7&#160;mV, respectively, due to the enhanced binding of subsurface Pt and Ni to surface Pt atoms through Pt skin, thereby inhibiting the dissolution of Pt and Ni.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Carbonylation of Azetidines via Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Difluorocarbene Insertion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We disclose a site&#8208;selective Cu&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation of azetidines promoted by difluorocarbene insertion at low temperature, enabling access to a variety of functionalized &#947;&#8208;lactams and a therapeutic agent for diabetes (40 examples). This skeletal expansion strategy provides a distinct disconnection approach to synthesize medicinally relevant five&#8208;membered heterocycles.








Abstract
&#947;&#8208;Lactams are privileged five&#8208;membered pharmaco&#8208;phores in numerous bioactive compounds, but access to these motifs typically relies on cycloaddition/substitution chemistry involving activated substrates or CO carbonylations under harsh conditions. Here, we report a new route to functionalized &#947;&#8208;lactams through formal carbonylation of azetidines under nonprecious metal catalysis. The method leverages a copper&#8208;stabilized difluorocarbene to promote site&#8208;selective insertion followed by in situ hydrolysis to unmask the lactam group. In contrast to most difluorocarbene reactions that cause ring cleavage of saturated heterocycles in the presence of heat, the present system operates at a low temperature and retains the integrity of the cyclic structure. Synthesis of various drug&#8208;like lactams and a therapeutic agent for diabetes highlights utility.

         <title>Biomimetic Hierarchical Construction of Anti&#8208;Tumor Polyoxopalladates for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering of lacunary polyoxopalladates resulted in a hierarchical assembly that resembles the construction of biomacromolecules. An ordered structural evolution from monomer via dimer to supramolecular aggregates was achieved by cooperative covalent and supramolecular bonding effects, resulting in enhanced anti&#8208;tumor activity via DNA damage.








Abstract
Inspired by the construction scheme of biomacromolecules, a hierarchical assembly based on the lacunary polyoxopalladate (POP) of [SrPd12O6(OH)3(PhAsO3)6(OAc)3]4&#8722; (SrPd12) has been achieved. As a structurally programmable molecular building block, SrPd12 is used to evolve from monomer via dimer to supramolecular aggregates in a controlled manner. In such process, the open&#8208;shell&#8208;type monomers are covalently integrated into bowl&#8208; or cage&#8208;like dimers via a direct or indirect splicing strategy. Upon that, hydrogen bond and hydrophobic effects are further hired to fabricate supramolecular aggregates of varied host&#8211;guest archetypes, thereby completing a hierarchical construction. In consideration of the combined advantages of noble metals and polyoxometalates in cancer treatment, both in vitro and in vivo&#160;anti&#8208;tumor assays of these SrPd12&#8208;derived POPs were studied in detail. A structure&#8208;dependent anti&#8208;tumor activitywas observed, originating from an imbalance of damage and repair of DNA as anti&#8208;tumor mechanism.

&lt;p&gt;Engineering of lacunary polyoxopalladates resulted in a hierarchical assembly that resembles the construction of biomacromolecules. An ordered structural evolution from monomer via dimer to supramolecular aggregates was achieved by cooperative covalent and supramolecular bonding effects, resulting in enhanced anti-tumor activity via DNA damage.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Controlled, Sequential Self&#8208;Sorting of Supramolecular Assemblies in Model Protocells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox reaction&#8208;mediated transient deactivation strategy has been employed to achieve sequential self&#8208;sorting of supramolecular structures in solution and inside model protocells&#8212;an unprecedented architecture in the field.








Abstract
Self&#8208;sorting of cellular components is essential for maintaining order and function in living systems, enabling complex processes to operate seamlessly. Emulating such self&#8208;sorting in synthetic self&#8208;assembly, however, has conventionally relied on structural or chirality mismatches of monomers yielding self&#8208;sorted systems under thermodynamic conditions. In contrast, reaction&#8208;coupled, kinetically controlled self&#8208;assembly, ubiquitous in biological systems, is critical for achieving spatiotemporal characteristics. Extending this principle to temporally self&#8208;sorted synthetic assemblies is key to developing multi&#8208;component biomimetic systems. Herein, we present a strategy towards this direction, to achieve sequential self&#8208;sorting of supramolecular assemblies through differences in the chemical&#8208;reactivity of monomers, coupled to redox&#8208;reactions. This approach exploits the distinct redox potentials of monomers to achieve precise temporal&#8208;control over self&#8208;sorting, while inherent structural mismatches among monomers ensure the kinetic stability of self&#8208;sorted state. Reduction reactions transiently disrupt their assemblies into dormant inactive monomeric states, while subsequent kinetically controlled reassembly occurs via reversible oxidation reactions. Finally, utilizing this sequential self&#8208;sorting, we aim to mimic multicomponent cellular self&#8208;organization by demonstrating the kinetically controlled growth of self&#8208;sorted structures in the presence of model protocells, using lipid vesicles as compartments. Although spatial&#8208;distribution remains non&#8208;selective, the dormant monomeric states facilitate monomer encapsulation and the unprecedented stepwise&#8208;formation of self&#8208;sorted assemblies within model protocells.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective Synthesis of Axially Chiral 1&#8208;Aryl Isoquinolines via De Novo Isoquinoline Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient synthesis of axially chiral 1&#8208;aryl isoquinolines through rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H activation/annulation of aromatic imines with alkynes is reported. An enantioselective de novo isoquinoline ring formation is involved in this process. Detailed experimental and theoretical studies revealed the turnover&#8208;limiting step of the reaction and the origin of enantioselectivity.








Abstract
Axially chiral heterobiaryl moieties serve as core skeletons for bioactive molecules, chiral ligands, and organocatalysts. Enantioselective de novo formation of the heteroaromatic ring is one of the most straightforward approaches to access enantioenriched heterobiaryls. Herein, an enantioselective de novo construction of isoquinolines by rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H activation/annulation of aromatic imines with alkynes is disclosed. This approach is operationally simple, allowing for rapid access to a variety of axially chiral 1&#8208;aryl isoquinolines in excellent yields and enantioselectivity (up to 98% yield and 99:1 er). The synthetic application of the current method was demonstrated by functional group transformations and suitability for millimolar&#8208;scale reactions. Detailed experimental and theoretical studies revealed the turnover&#8208;limiting step and provided insight into the origin of the enantioselectivity for this reaction.

         <title>Oligoether Chain Engineering in Covalent Organic Frameworks: Enhancing Transport Pathways and Oxygen Reduction Activity for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oligoether chain engineering in covalent organic frameworks with hydrophilic ethylene oxide&#8208;based structures enhances mass diffusion and facilitates the formation of OOH* intermediate in the oxygen reduction reaction, leading to accelerated reaction kinetics and high selectivity for the two&#8208;electron pathway in hydrogen peroxide production.








Abstract
Oligoethers with various numbers of ethylene oxide (EO) units, known for their flexibility, electronegativity, and hydrophilicity, can be leveraged to construct complex molecular architectures with broad applicability. In this study, we present the synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) incorporating oligoethers with EO segments of varying lengths (2D&#8208;COF&#8208;EOs) to explore the role of EO units in modulating the two&#8208;electron (2e&#8722;) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway for electrocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. By embedding hydrophilic EO side chains into the hydrophobic frameworks, intermolecular interactions are promoted through hydrogen bonding, leading to the self&#8208;assembly and spatial aggregation of these side chains. The high crystallinity of the COFs facilitates orderly stacking of the skeleton, creating hydrophilic nanoscale transport channels that enhance ORR kinetics. Among the synthesized COFs, 2D&#8208;COF&#8208;EO1, which contains one EO group, exhibits a remarkable H2O2 production rate of 5820&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and a 2e&#8722; ORR selectivity of 89.2%. Theoretical calculations and in situ electrocatalytic experiments reveal that the elongation of the EO units significantly alters the electronic structure of carbon atoms adjacent to oxygen atoms, lowering the energy barriers associated with the formation of OOH* intermediates and thus promoting the 2e&#8722; ORR pathway. This work offers valuable insights into optimizing COFs with different EO units for efficient 2e&#8722; ORR&#8208;based electrocatalytic processes.

         <title>Alcohol Activation by Benzodithiolylium for Deoxygenative Alkylation Driven by Photocatalytic Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,3&#8208;Benzodithiolylium cation was identified as an alcohol&#8208;activating reagent for energy&#8208;transfer&#8208;driven deoxygenative radical alkylation, avoiding electron transfer. Photocatalytic deoxygenative coupling reactions of alcohols with diverse oxime carbonates involving selective C(sp3)&#9472;C(sp3) bond construction are presented, including energy&#8208;transfer&#8208;driven carboimination of alkenes, energy transfer (EnT)/nickel dual&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening cross&#8208;coupling, and cyclization cross&#8208;coupling. 








Abstract
The 1,3&#8208;benzodithiolylium (BDT) cation was identified as an efficient hydroxyl&#8208;activating reagent for the photocatalytic deoxygenative radical functionalization of alcohols in the absence of any electron transfer process. A series of unprecedented photocatalytic energy transfer (EnT)&#8208;driven deoxygenative radical coupling reactions of alcohols with bifunctional oxime carbonates have been developed based on the activation by BDT. Nickel&#8208;catalyzed radical sorting followed by C(sp3)&#9472;C(sp3) bond construction facilitates the heteroselective cross&#8208;coupling of two distinct alkyl radicals originating from parallel radical relays. These reactions allow the versatile synthesis of diverse nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules, including amino acid derivatives, imines, nitriles, and pyrrolines, by using ubiquitous alcohols as regiodefined alkyl building blocks.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Regiodivergent Carbosilylation of 1,3&#8208;Dienes via Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Three&#8208;Component Coupling Reactions</title>

         <dc:description>
A regiodivergent nickel&#8208;catalyzed carbosilylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes using aldehydes and silylboranes has been developed, with ligand control influencing the reaction pathway. The employment of triethylphosphine promotes 4,3&#8208;addition selectivity, whereas using (2&#8208;biphenyl)dicyclohexylphosphine leads to 4,1&#8208;addition selectivity.








Abstract
The regiodivergent carbosilylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes presents a formidable challenge due to inherently complex selectivity control over multiple potential reaction pathways. Here, we report a ligand&#8208;controlled, regiodivergent carbosilylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with aldehydes and silylboranes, achieving unprecedented site&#8208;selectivity using nickel catalysts with distinct phosphine ligands. The use of triethylphosphine promotes 4,3&#8208;addition selectivity, while employing (2&#8208;biphenyl)dicyclohexylphosphine facilitates 4,1&#8208;addition selectivity. This method displays excellent regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity, as well as a broad substrate scope and substantial functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies indicate that the ligand choice is crucial for directing the reaction pathway and stabilizing &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8208;nickel intermediates. Our protocol provides a practical and efficient approach to synthesizing valuable functionalized allylsilanes, which are important in various synthetic applications.

         <title>Superfast Protein Desulfurization Triggered by Low&#8208;Energy Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical strategy of low&#8208;energy visible light&#8208;induced desulfurization (LEnVLD) has been developed to enable superfast and clean desulfurization under exceptionally mild conditions. The utility of LEnVLD was demonstrated through the clean desulfurization of a wide range of peptide and protein substrates, and its convenience and robustness facilitated the application of LEnVLD in versatile reaction scenarios such as solid&#8208;supported desulfurization and flow chemistry&#8208;based desulfurization.








Abstract
The combination of transthioesterification&#8208;based ligation of thiol&#8208;derived amino acids and the post&#8208;ligation desulfurization has greatly expanded the scope of modern chemical protein synthesis. Here, we report a new strategy of low&#8208;energy visible light&#8208;induced desulfurization (LEnVLD) that enables superfast and clean protein desulfurization (half life =&#160;1.7&#160;s) with improved reaction selectivity compared to the previous methods. The LEnVLD method can be easily carried out under very mild conditions using only a catalytic amount of fluorescent dye and household flashlight (ca. 5&#160;W) irradiation, eliminating the need for any pyrophoric reagent, thiol additives, or excessive radical initiators, and its practicality was demonstrated by the fast and high&#8208;yielding desulfurization of more than 30 peptide and protein substrates bearing a variety of sensitive functional groups (e.g., Thz, N&#8208;alkylated maleimide, and thioester). Moreover, the convenience and robustness of LEnVLD enable its extension to versatile reaction scenarios (e.g., solid&#8208;supported desulfurization and flow chemistry&#8208;based desulfurization) that would enhance the practical capability of chemical protein synthesis.

         <title>Direct Conversion of Aromatic Lactones into Bioisosteres by Carbonyl&#8208;to&#8208;Boranol Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed group&#8208;exchange strategy has been developed for the direct conversion of aromatic lactones into cyclic hemiboronic acid bioisosteres. Scope evaluation and product derivatization experiments demonstrate broad functional&#8208;group compatibility and the synthetic value of this strategy. Furthermore, the application of this methodology to the rapid modification of lactone cores in bioactive molecules underscores its practical utility.








Abstract
Bioisosteric replacement is an important strategy in drug discovery and is commonly practiced in medicinal chemistry; however, the incorporation of bioisosteres typically requires laborious multistep de novo synthesis. The direct conversion of a functional group into its corresponding bioisostere is of particular significance in evaluating structure&#8208;property relationships. Herein, we report a functional&#8208;group&#8208;exchange strategy that enables the direct conversion of aromatic lactones, a prevalent motif in bioactive molecules, into their corresponding cyclic hemiboronic acid bioisosteres. Scope evaluation and product derivatization experiments demonstrate the synthetic value and broad functional&#8208;group compatibility of this strategy, while the application of this methodology to the rapid remodeling of chromenone cores in bioactive molecules highlights its utility.

         <title>Separation of MnWOx and NaWSiOx Phases Boosts Oxidative Coupling of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite of MnWOx and NaWSiOx separated at the nanoscale shows promising performances for the oxidative coupling of CH4, offering C2&#8211;3 selectivity of 79% with a ratio of olefins/paraffins of 2.2 at a CH4 conversion of 32% at 775&#160;&#176;C. The use of MnWOx instead of MnOx regulates the redox property and suppresses the deep oxidation of CH4. The composite catalyst shows a significant synergistic effect in the formation of C2&#8211;C3 products. The active oxygen species formed on MnWOx is proposed to migrate to NaWSiOx, where the selective activation and coupling of CH4 is accelerated.








Abstract
The oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) is an attractive approach for methane transformations, but achieving a satisfactory combination of activity and selectivity remains challenging, even with the promising Mn&#8211;Na2WO4/SiO2 catalyst. Herein, we demonstrate that nanoscale separation of Mn&#8208;based and Na2WO4&#8208;based phases results in a highly efficient catalyst, achieving a remarkable 79% selectivity for C2&#8211;C3 hydrocarbons at a 32% CH4 conversion at 775&#160;&#176;C, outperforming most previously reported catalysts. Our studies reveal that MnWOx phases with adjustable surface Mn/W ratios and redox activities are more effective for the selective activation of O2, thereby enhancing the OCM of CH4. The assembly of MnWOx and Na2WO4/SiO2 components in nanoscale proximity significantly promotes the formation of C2&#8211;C3 hydrocarbons by suppressing deep oxidation. We propose a bifunctional mechanism involving the transfer of active oxygen species from MnWOx to Na2WO4/SiO2, which induces selective activation and coupling of CH4 on the Na2WO4/SiO2 surface.

         <title>Discovery and Biosynthesis of Celluxanthenes, Antibacterial Arylpolyene Alkaloids From Diverse Cellulose&#8208;Degrading Anaerobic Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure and biosynthetic origin of the enigmatic &#8220;yellow affinity substance&#8221; (YAS) from the anaerobe thermophile Clostridium thermocellum (now: Acetivibrio thermocellus) were elucidated. YAS is a complex of unusual antibacterial arylpolyene alkaloids (celluxanthenes) that are produced by various cellulolytic anaerobes.








Abstract
Cellulose degradation by anaerobic bacteria plays an eminent role in the global carbon cycle and is a critical step in biofuel production. The anaerobic thermophile Clostridium thermocellum (now: Acetivibrio thermocellus) is particularly efficient at breaking down biomass and produces a &#8220;yellow affinity substance&#8221; (YAS), a pigment that has been implicated in signaling and conferring higher affinity of the cellulosome to YAS&#8208;loaded cellulose. However, the nature and biosynthetic origin of YAS have remained elusive. Here, we show by isolation and structure elucidation that YAS is a complex of unusual arylpolyene alkaloids (celluxanthenes). Stable isotope labeling experiments reveal all biosynthetic building blocks for celluxanthene assembly. Through a targeted gene deletion, we identify the celluxanthene (cex) biosynthesis gene cluster and propose a biosynthetic model in which an arylpolyene generated by an iterative type I polyketide synthase (PKS) undergoes a head&#8208;to&#8208;head fusion with a tryptophan&#8208;derived ketoacid to form a tetronate. Genome mining and metabolic profiling revealed that diverse cellulolytic anaerobes harbor cex gene loci and produce celluxanthene congeners. Celluxanthenes show antibiotic activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria including clinically relevant strains. This study solves the long&#8208;standing enigma surrounding the nature of YAS and lays the groundwork for elucidating the precise biological roles of these intricate pigments.

         <title>An Immediate Bacterial&#8208;Responsive Supramolecular Thio&#8208;Naphthalene Diimide: A Real&#8208;Time NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Anti&#8208;Bacterial</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular thio&#8208;naphthalene diimide can be immediately reduced to a supramolecular radical anion by bacteria, leading to a NIR&#8208;II absorption. This strategy effectively raises the reduction potential, thereby greatly boosting the reduction speed. This approach has been used as a real&#8208;time NIR&#8208;II photothermal anti&#8208;bacterial and opens new horizons for bio&#8208;responsive agents.








Abstract
A new kind of supramolecular thio&#8208;naphthalene diimide (SNDI) which can be immediately reduced as supramolecular radical anion by bacteria is reported. The introduction of thiocarbonyl effectively elevates the reduction potential of SNDI, largely increasing the bacteria&#8208;response speed in hypoxia. It selectively distinguishes the bacteria with high and low reduction ability in real time. The host&#8211;guest complexation of SNDI and cucurbit[7]uril can enhance radical anion quantum yield, ensuring intense NIR&#8208;II absorption and realizing high photothermal conversion. The real&#8208;time NIR&#8208;II photothermal anti&#8208;bacteria is successfully carried out. This development will enrich the design of bio&#8208;responsive agent with promising future towards actual application.

         <title>Spherical Nucleic Acids&#8208;Directed Cryosynthesis of Manganese Nanoagents for Tumor Imaging and Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

DNA&#8208;templated theranostic manganese nanoparticles synthesized under liquid nitrogen show features of magnetic resonance imaging, gene silencing, and chemodynamic therapy for tumors.








Abstract
DNAzyme&#8208;based theranostic nanotechnologies that can respond to specific tumor pathophysiological parameters hold great promise for tumor diagnostics and effective treatments. However, their clinical translation is hindered by insufficient intracellular availability of essential metal cofactors required for DNAzyme activation. To overcome this limitation, we developed a temperature&#8208;controlled synthesis strategy for fabricating multifunctional DNA&#8208;templated manganese carbonate nanoparticles (DtMnP). The process involves three critical phases: (i) spherical nucleic acid hybrids, DNAzyme&#8208;functionalized AuNPs, serve as scaffolds for spatially controlled Mn2+ deposition through phosphate coordination, initiating heterogeneous nucleation of MnCO3; (ii) rapid liquid nitrogen freezing induces nanoparticle growth along DNA templates; and (iii) lyophilization&#8208;mediated structural stabilization enables convenient long&#8208;term storage. The DtMnP exhibits pH&#8208;responsive dissolution, releasing 90% of Mn2+ within 60&#160;min under tumor microenvironment conditions (pH 5.5). The released Mn2+ ion enables dual functionality: (i) superior magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast of MCF&#8208;7 xenograft models with enhanced biosafety, and (ii) synergistic therapeutic efficacy through DNAzyme&#8208;mediated EGR&#8208;1 gene silencing (60% mRNA downregulation) combined with Mn2+&#8208;catalyzed Fenton reactions generating cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals (45% apoptosis in MCF&#8208;7 cells). The cryo&#8208;encapsulated DtMnP exemplifies a flexible and efficient approach for integrating various functional components into a single nanoparticle for tumor theranostic applications.

         <title>Electrolyte Chemistry Development for Sodium&#8208;Based Batteries: A Blueprint from Lithium or a Step Toward Originality?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unique solvation environment of sodium cations, brought by their larger ion volume and lower charge density, significantly impacts the physicochemical and interfacial properties of sodium&#8208;based electrolytes, highlighting the crucial importance of moving beyond mere mimicry of lithium&#8208;based designs.








Abstract
Currently, electrolyte design for sodium&#8208;based batteries is largely inherited from their lithium&#8208;based counterparts, which often present critical challenges that hinder forging new perspectives and thus further improvements. This work delves into the key properties of representative sodium&#8208; and lithium&#8208;based electrolytes, encompassing prevailing salt anions. It aims to evaluate the impact of cation chemistry, including their nature and the degree of interactions with counter anions, thereby bridging the gap in effectively transferring the know&#8208;how accumulated in lithium batteries to sodium&#8208;based batteries. The results demonstrate that the unique impact of salt anions on the properties of metal&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes is tightly correlated with the nature of metal cations. By synchronizing the anionic structures with the critical features of sodium cations, the solvating dynamics and transport properties, chemical stability, aluminum corrosion behavior, and other key properties of the electrolytes could be finely tuned to fit the specific requirements of advanced sodium&#8208;based batteries. This work gives an in&#8208;depth insight into the chemical and physical features of sodium&#8208;based electrolytes, with a potential avenue to accelerate the deployment of high&#8208;performance sodium batteries and simultaneously inspire and guide the design of other electrolytes for emerging mono&#8208; and multivalent cation&#8208;based rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Core&#8208;Shell Hyperbranched Polymers via Catalytic Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work explores the synthesis, characterization, and applications of hyperbranched polymers (HBP) using a divergent ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) approach. An ABB&#8242;&#8208;type hyperbranching monomer, formed by covalently linking a traditional ROMP monomer to a chain transfer agent, was diluted with a linear comonomer to produce branched polymers with controlled molar mass and dispersity. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and X&#8208;ray scattering confirmed their globular shape in solution. Additionally, we functionalized HBPs to create core&#8208;shell materials capable of encapsulating organic dyes efficiently. The study also highlights their role in sustainable polymer design, demonstrating degradation under mild acidic conditions. Core&#8208;shell particles synthesized via this approach enabled efficient capture and rapid, on&#8208;demand release of guest molecules, emphasizing their potential in drug delivery and advanced materials science.</dc:description>

         <title>A Novel Synthetic Pathway to Lanthanide Triple&#8208;Decker Complexes: Selective Expansion of a Sandwich Complex by an Insertion Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new reaction pathway is disclosed, in which for the first time a lanthanide half&#8208;sandwich unit inserts into an existing sandwich complex. As a result, a triple&#8208;decker complex is formed, which can also be accessed in a salt metathesis from unprecedented inverse sandwich compounds.








Abstract
Commonly, multi&#8208;decker sandwich complexes can either be formed in a one&#8208;step reaction or in a stepwise fashion by stacking deck by deck. Herein, we showcase a new reaction pathway, in which for the first time a lanthanide half&#8208;sandwich unit inserts into an existing sandwich complex. As a result of the insertion of a cyclocene half&#8208;sandwich fragment {LnII(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)} (CotTIPS&#160;=&#160;1,4&#8208;(iPr3Si)2C8H62&#8722;) into a classical divalent sandwich complex [LnII(&#951;9&#8208;Cnt)2] (Ln&#160;=&#160;Sm, Eu, Yb; Cnt&#160;=&#160;C9H9&#8722;$_{9^-}$), the unprecedented triple&#8208;decker sandwich complexes of the type [(&#951;9&#8208;Cnt)LnII(&#956;&#8208;&#951;8:&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)LnII(&#951;9&#8208;Cnt)] were obtained. A plausible reaction pathway was determined by quantum chemical calculations. Additionally, we synthesize the same lanthanide sandwich complexes in a traditional, stepwise fashion. For this, we initially present the novel inverse sandwich compounds [LnIII(thf)2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;8:&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)LnIII(thf)2] (Ln&#160;=&#160;Sm,&#160;Eu, thf&#160;=&#160;tetrahydrofuran) and [YbII(BH4)(thf)2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;8:&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)YbII(BH4)(thf)2] consisting of a cyclooctatetraene middle deck sandwiched between two divalent lanthanides as precursors. Subsequent salt metathesis reactions with [K(Cnt)] (Cnt&#160;=&#160;C9H9&#8722;$_{9^-}$) gave rise to the title compounds [(&#951;9&#8208;Cnt)LnII(&#956;&#8208;&#951;8:&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)LnII(&#951;9&#8208;Cnt)]. The unique feature of these compounds is the combination of the two largest aromatic all&#8208;carbon rings known in coordination chemistry&#8212;the 8&#8208; and 9&#8208;membered rings&#8212;into lanthanide triple&#8208;decker sandwich compounds.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Dendritic Oligo&#8208;Glycerol Cationic Surfactants for Enhanced Antibacterial Efficacy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An orthogonal click chemistry approach was used to synthesize a series of cationic surfactants. The results show that an optimal balance between positive charges and hydrophobicity is a crucial factor for the improvement of antibacterial properties. Within our synthesized library, surfactants with a C12 alkyl chain and four positive charges showed remarkable bactericidal activity and antibiofilm effects against drug&#8208;resistant MRSA. In addition, these surfactants significantly promoted wound healing in MRSA&#8208;infected wounds.








Abstract
Bacterial infections and antibiotic resistance present an ever&#8208;increasing threat to human health worldwide, and medicine urgently needs new alternatives for the successful treatment of bacterial infections. Cationic surfactants have proven to be effective antibacterial agents due to their ability to disrupt bacterial membranes, inhibit biofilm formation, and combat a broad spectrum of pathogens. We employed a orthogonal click chemistry strategy for the efficient modular synthesis of six novel cationic surfactants. Our results emphasize the strong correlation between the surfactant design and its antibacterial potential. Among these six cationic surfactants we identified a prime candidate, which possessed an impressive antibacterial effect against gram&#8208;positive and gram&#8208;negative bacteria, including drug&#8208;resistant strains. We found that our surfactant can prevent biofilm formation and eradicate already existing biofilms. Cryo&#8208;TEM imaging was used to reveal the membrane&#8208;disrupting properties of the surfactant. In&#8208;vivo wound healing experiments underline the surfactants&#8217; ability to inhibit wound infections. Cationic surfactants often face the challenge of balancing strong antibacterial activity with minimal cytotoxicity. Our strategic design and orthogonal click chemistry approach have enabled precise fine&#8208;tuning of molecular structures to achieve an optimal balance between antibacterial efficacy and biocompatibility, effectively overcoming this critical limitation.

         <title>Constructing Robust Electrode/Electrolyte Interphases for Highly Stable Lithium&#8211;Sulfurized Polyacrylonitrile Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The anion&#8208;moderate solvation structure based interconnected clusters are realized by regulating the interactions of solvent with Li+ and diluent. The electrolyte with this unique structure can promote to construct robust electrode/electrolyte interphases for high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) batteries. Moreover, a pouch&#8208;type Li&#8211;SPAN battery with a capacity of 3.75 Ah exhibits a high energy density of 180&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 0.1 C.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) batteries show great promise for energy storage, but are plagued by poor cycling stability, which can be attributed to unfavorable electrode/electrolyte interphases for both anode and cathode. Here we design and achieve the anion&#8208;moderate solvation structure based interconnected clusters in electrolyte by regulating the interactions of solvent with Li+ and diluent to construct robust anode/electrolyte and cathode/electrolyte interphases simultaneously for high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;SPAN batteries. The optimal electrolyte endows Li plating/stripping with a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.47% at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in Li||Cu cells. The Li&#8211;SPAN batteries show excellent cycling stability with a high capacity retention of 94.21% after 1215 cycles. Moreover, the assembled pouch&#8208;type Li&#8211;SPAN battery under limited electrolyte condition (2.40&#160;g Ah&#8722;1) achieves a capacity of 3.75 Ah, corresponding to a high energy density of 180&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 based on the total mass of the battery. This work provides a good electrolyte design principle to construct robust anode/electrolyte and cathode/electrolyte interphases for batteries.

         <title>Leveraging Noncovalent Interactions for the Binding of CO by a Weakly Lewis Acidic Borane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a carbonyl complex featuring a simple tri&#8208;coordinate borane, characterized by a Lewis acidity which is only marginally higher than B(NMe2)3. Exposure of {(Ph2P)xanth}3B to carbon monoxide under mild conditions (1 bar, 25 &#176;C) reversibly yields {(Ph2P)xanth}3B&#183;CO. Dispersion forces are critical to substrate binding: the two binding modes in which the B&#8208;bound CO guest is located inside/outside the host cage differ in energy by 59.5 kcal mol&#8722;1.








Abstract
Known boron carbonyl complexes either exploit very high Lewis acidity or a low oxidation state boron centre in order to capture CO. By contrast, we report a carbonyl complex featuring a simple tri&#8208;coordinate borane, characterized by a Lewis acidity which is only marginally higher than B(NMe2)3. {(Ph2P)xanth}3B features a solid&#8208;state structure in which two of the three B&#8208;bound xanth(PPh2) units are projected above the BC3 plane, generating an up, up, down conformation. Quantum chemical methods, however, reveal that the alternative up, up, up alignment, characterized by a cage&#8208;like geometry and enhanced intramolecular noncovalent interactions, is favored significantly in silico (by ca. 33.0&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1). Although this conformation is optimal for binding polar C3&#8208;symmetric H&#8208;bond donors such as NH3 (and related guests such as H2O and MeNH2) the binding of essentially nonpolar substrates such as CO would be expected to be weak at best. However, exposure of {(Ph2P)xanth}3B to CO under mild conditions (1&#160;bar, 25 &#176;C) reversibly yields {(Ph2P)xanth}3B&#183;CO, a tractable cage&#8208;like borane carbonyl adduct featuring a central BCO moiety shrouded by xanth(PPh2) moieties. Dispersion forces are critical to substrate binding: the two binding modes in which the B&#8208;bound CO guest is located inside/outside the host cage differ in energy by 59.5&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1.

Dispersion forces are critical to substrate binding: the two binding modes in which the B-bound CO guest is located inside/outside the host cage differ in energy by 59.5 kcal mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Known boron carbonyl complexes either exploit very high Lewis acidity or a low oxidation state boron centre in order to capture CO. By contrast, we report a carbonyl complex featuring a simple tri-coordinate borane, characterized by a Lewis acidity which is only marginally higher than B(NMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. {(Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P)xanth}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B features a solid-state structure in which two of the three B-bound xanth(PPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) units are projected above the BC&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; plane, generating an &lt;i&gt;up&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;up&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;down&lt;/i&gt; conformation. Quantum chemical methods, however, reveal that the alternative &lt;i&gt;up&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;up&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;up&lt;/i&gt; alignment, characterized by a cage-like geometry and enhanced intramolecular noncovalent interactions, is favored significantly in silico (by ca. 33.0&#160;kcal mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Although this conformation is optimal for binding polar &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric H-bond donors such as NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (and related guests such as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and MeNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) the binding of essentially nonpolar substrates such as CO would be expected to be weak at best. However, exposure of {(Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P)xanth}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B to CO under mild conditions (1&#160;bar, 25 &#176;C) reversibly yields {(Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P)xanth}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B&#183;CO, a tractable cage-like borane carbonyl adduct featuring a central BCO moiety shrouded by xanth(PPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) moieties. Dispersion forces are critical to substrate binding: the two binding modes in which the B-bound CO guest is located inside/outside the host cage differ in energy by 59.5&#160;kcal mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Remote Spin&#8208;Center Shift Enables Activation of Distal Benzylic C&#9472;O and C&#9472;N Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A remote spin&#8208;center shift process that involves 1,n&#8208;radical translocation followed by elimination of a leaving group has been developed to enable distal benzylic C&#9472;O and C&#9472;N bond activation. By this process, a 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP)&#8208;boryl radical promoted radical deoxygenative and deaminative functionalization of free benzylic alcohols and simple benzylic amines to afford a wide range of alkylated products.








Abstract
A spin&#8208;center shift (SCS) is a radical process that commonly involves a 1,2&#8208;radical shift along with the elimination of an adjacent leaving group by a two&#8208;electron ionic movement. The conventional SCS process is largely limited to 1,2&#8208;radical translocation, while a remote SCS event involving 1,n&#8208;radical translocation over a greater distance to enable distal bond functionalization remains largely underexplored. Herein, we report the boryl radical&#8208;promoted distal deoxygenation and deamination of free benzylic alcohols and simple benzylic amines, respectively, through a remote SCS event. The reaction was initiated by the addition of a 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP)&#8208;boryl radical to the carbonyl oxygen atom of a benzoate or benzamide. Then, radical translocation took place across the aromatic ring to promote benzylic C&#9472;O or C&#9472;N bond cleavage. The resulting radical intermediate subsequently coupled with various alkenes to afford a wide range of alkylated products. The proposed mechanistic pathway was supported by experimental investigations.

         <title>Amphiphilic Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework for Improved CO2 Separation in PIM&#8208;1 Mixed Matrix Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An improvement in compatibility between filler ZIF&#8208;94 and polymer PIM&#8208;1 in mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) was achieved through ligand exchange with undecylimidazole (umIm). The modified ZIF&#8208;94 (ZIF&#8208;94&#8208;umIm) presents amphiphilic character and high CO2 adsorption (2.34&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 at 90&#160;kPa and 0 &#176;C). The MMM with 5&#160;wt.% loading showed a 70% increase in CO2 permeability (8900 Barrer) and 10% higher CO2/N2 selectivity (20.2) compared to pure PIM&#8208;1 membranes.








Abstract
This study aims to enhance the compatibility between filler and polymer in mixed matrix membranes (MMMs), addressing an important challenge in membrane development. ZIF&#8208;94, known for its affinity to CO2, was partially modified with 2&#8208;undecylimidazolate (umIm) through the solvent&#8208;assisted ligand exchange (SALE) method to improve its compatibility with the prototypical polymer of intrinsic microporosity PIM&#8208;1. The modified ZIF&#8208;94 (ZIF&#8208;94&#8208;umIm) can be considered as an amphiphilic MOF with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties, while maintaining a considerably high CO2 adsorption capacity (2.34&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 at 90&#160;kPa and 0&#160;&#176;C). Gas separation experiments were performed using mixed gas compositions of 15/85 CO2/N2 at 3&#160;bar and 35 &#176;C. The resulting MMM with a 5&#160;wt.% loading exhibited an enhanced CO2 separation performance, with ca. 70% and 10% increases in CO2 permeability (8900 Barrer) and CO2/N2 selectivity (20.2), respectively, compared to pristine PIM&#8208;1 membranes. In addition, thin film nanocomposite membranes were prepared showing a 23.5 CO2/N2 selectivity at 2350 GPU of CO2. This modification strategy shows a great potential for improving the CO2 capture technologies, highlighting the potential of tailoring MOF fillers for advanced membrane materials in gas separation applications.

         <title>Engineering Bodipy&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Full&#8208;Spectrum Photocatalysis in Amide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three highly&#160;stable bodipy&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (BMOFs) were synthesized by treating dicarboxyl&#8208;functionalized bodipy ligands with Zr&#8208;oxo clusters. Featuring the distinct bodipy scaffold in the framework, these BMOFs displayed high reactivity in heterogenous photocatalytic C&#9472;H bond&#160;activation of N,N&#8208;dimethylanilines to access amides under visible light.








Abstract
Developing photocatalysts that can efficiently utilize the full solar spectrum is a crucial step toward transforming sustainable energy solutions. Due to their light absorption limitations, most photo&#8208;responsive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are constrained to the ultraviolet (UV) and blue light regions. Expanding their absorption to encompass the entire solar spectrum would unlock their full potential, greatly enhancing efficiency and applicability. Here, we report the design and synthesis of a series of highly stable boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (bodipy)&#8208;based MOFs (BMOFs) by reacting dicarboxyl&#8208;functionalized bodipy ligands with Zr&#8208;oxo clusters. Leveraging the acidity of the methyl groups on the bodipy backbone, we expanded the conjugation system through a solid&#8208;state condensation reaction with various aldehydes, achieving full&#8208;color absorption, thereby extending the band edge into the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) and infrared (IR) regions. These BMOFs demonstrated exceptional reactivity and recyclability in heterogeneous photocatalytic activities, including C&#9472;H bond activation of saturated aza&#8208;heterocycles and C&#9472;N bond cleavage of N,N&#8208;dimethylanilines to produce amides under visible light. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of BMOFs in photocatalysis, marking a significant leap forward in the design of advanced photocatalytic materials with tunable properties.

         <title>Decoding the Chemical Language of Ribosomally Synthesized and Post&#8208;Translationally Modified Peptides from the Untapped Archaea Domain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Secondary metabolites (SMs) are essential across all life domains, yet those originating from the Archaea domain remain poorly understood. Here, the systematic genome mining and the pioneering heterologous expression of archaeal SMs have revealed the chemical landscape of archaeal lanthipeptides, showing both canonical and non&#8208;canonical forms. These lanthipeptides exhibit antagonistic activity and activate the host's motility, likely shaping the archaeal community and mediating environmental adaptation.








Abstract
Chemical communication is crucial in ecosystems with complex microbial communities. However, the difficulties inherent to the cultivation of archaea have led to a limited understanding of their chemical language, especially regarding the structure diversity and function of secondary metabolites (SMs). Our in&#8208;depth exploration into the biosynthetic potential of archaea has unveiled the previously unexplored biosynthetic capabilities and chemical diversity of archaeal ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). Through the first application of heterologous expression in archaeal SM discovery, we have identified 24 lanthipeptides, including a distinctive type featuring diamino&#8208;dicarboxylic termini. It highlights the uniqueness of archaeal biosynthetic pathways and significantly expands the chemical landscape of archaeal SMs. Additionally, archaeal lanthipeptides demonstrate antagonistic activity against haloarchaea, mediating the unique biotic interaction in the halophilic niche. They showcase a new ecological role of RiPPs in enhancing the host's motility by inducing the rod&#8208;shaped cell morphology and upregulating the archaellin gene expression, facilitating the archaeal interaction with abiotic environments. These discoveries broaden our understanding of archaeal chemical language and provide promising prospects for future exploration of SM&#8208;mediated interaction.

These lanthipeptides exhibit antagonistic activity and activate the host's motility, likely shaping the archaeal community and mediating environmental adaptation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemical communication is crucial in ecosystems with complex microbial communities. However, the difficulties inherent to the cultivation of archaea have led to a limited understanding of their chemical language, especially regarding the structure diversity and function of secondary metabolites (SMs). Our in-depth exploration into the biosynthetic potential of archaea has unveiled the previously unexplored biosynthetic capabilities and chemical diversity of archaeal ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). Through the first application of heterologous expression in archaeal SM discovery, we have identified 24 lanthipeptides, including a distinctive type featuring diamino-dicarboxylic termini. It highlights the uniqueness of archaeal biosynthetic pathways and significantly expands the chemical landscape of archaeal SMs. Additionally, archaeal lanthipeptides demonstrate antagonistic activity against haloarchaea, mediating the unique biotic interaction in the halophilic niche. They showcase a new ecological role of RiPPs in enhancing the host's motility by inducing the rod-shaped cell morphology and upregulating the archaellin gene expression, facilitating the archaeal interaction with abiotic environments. These discoveries broaden our understanding of archaeal chemical language and provide promising prospects for future exploration of SM-mediated interaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Capturing Unstable Carbanionic Intermediates via Halogen Transfer: Base&#8208;Promoted Oxidative Coupling Reactions of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Difluoromethylarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The merger of deprotonation and halogenation into compatible processes provides a new strategy for functionalizing traditionally unstable carbanionic intermediates, including &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorobenzylic carbanions. This capability is leveraged toward the first general method for oxidative coupling of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoromethylarenes with common pronucleophiles to produce valuable &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorobenzylic (thio)ethers.








Abstract
We describe how the merger of deprotonation, halogenation, and substitution into compatible processes enables the productive functionalization of traditionally unstable carbanionic intermediates. This strategy enables the first oxidative coupling protocol of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorobenzylic C&#9472;H bonds with heteronucleophiles. Here, transiently generated &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorobenzylic carbanionic intermediates undergo halogen transfer from 2&#8208;bromothiophenes to form electrophilic ArCF2Br compounds for in situ nucleophilic substitution, thereby avoiding &#945;&#8208;fluoride elimination pathways that typically plague &#945;&#8208;fluorocarbanions. This method streamlines the modular synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorobenzyl(thio)ethers and led to the broader realization that halogen transfer to unstable carbanions is an enabling principle across diverse C(sp2)&#9472;H and C(sp3)&#9472;H systems.

         <title>Antibacterial Siderophores of Pandoraea Pathogens and Their Impact on the Diseased Lung Microbiota</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genome mining of environmental and pathogenic Pandoraea species identified a conserved NRPS gene cluster and led to the discovery of novel siderophores, pandorabactins, which exert their antibacterial activity by depleting iron from competitors. Bioinformatic analysis of sputum from cystic fibrosis patients coupled with bioassays indicates that pandorabactins outcompete other bacteria in sequestering iron and have an impact on the diseased lung microbiota.








Abstract
Antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria of the genus Pandoraea, frequently acquired from the environment, are an emerging cause of opportunistic respiratory infections, especially in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. However, their specialized metabolites, including niche and virulence factors, remained unknown. Through genome mining of environmental and clinical isolates of diverse Pandoraea species, we identified a highly conserved biosynthesis gene cluster (pan) that codes for a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) assembling a new siderophore. Using bioinformatics&#8208;guided metabolic profiling of wild type and a targeted null mutant, we discovered the corresponding metabolites, pandorabactin A and B. Their structures and chelate (gallium) complexes were elucidated by a combination of chemical degradation, derivatization, NMR, and MS analysis. Metagenomics and bioinformatics of sputum samples of CF patients indicated that the presence of the pan gene locus correlates with the prevalence of specific bacteria in the lung microbiome. Bioassays and mass spectrometry imaging showed that pandorabactins have antibacterial activities against various lung pathogens (Pseudomonas, Mycobacterium, and Stenotrophomonas) through depleting iron in the competitors. Taken together, these findings offer first insight into niche factors of Pandoraea and indicate that pandorabactins shape the diseased lung microbiota through the competition for iron.

         <title>Photovoltaic Absorber &#8220;Glues&#8221; for Efficient Bifacial Selenium Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A glue&#8208;bonding strategy using high&#8208;viscosity molten selenium (Se) as an adhesive is reported to bond two fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide (FTO) glasses, creating bifacial solar cells without magnetron sputtering. The Se cells exhibit a bifaciality factor of 90.1%, with efficiencies of 8.61% under 1&#8208;sun with an albedo of 0.3 and 26.17% under 1000&#8208;lux indoor illumination with an albedo of 0.8.








Abstract
Bifacial solar cells hold great potential for achieving higher power output than conventional monofacial devices by harvesting solar irradiance from both their front and rear surfaces. However, almost all currently reported bifacial devices typically require a sputtered rear transparent conducting oxide electrode, which can damage the underlying layers due to plasma effects during the deposition process. Here, we report a glue&#8208;bonding strategy that uses a high&#8208;viscosity photovoltaic absorber slurry&#8212;in the case of molten selenium (Se)&#8212;as the adhesive to bond two charge&#8208;transport layer&#8208;deposited commercial fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide glasses, directly creating bifacial solar cells without the use of magnetron sputtering. We find that molten Se exhibits relatively high viscosity, high stability, and Newtonian fluid characteristics, facilitating film formation using this strategy. The resulting bifacial Se solar cells exhibit a bifaciality factor of 90.1%, surpassing all types of conventional thin&#8208;film solar cells. These cells achieve efficiencies of 8.61% under 1&#8208;sun illumination with an albedo of 0.3 and 26.17% under 1000&#8208;lux indoor illumination with an albedo of 0.8, with no efficiency loss after 1000&#160;h of ambient storage.

         <title>Effect of Alternating Polarity in Electrochemical Olefin Hydrocarboxylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alternating polarity (AP) is a powerful tool for controlling selectivity in olefin hydrofunctionalization, but this use is underdeveloped. Using electrochemical olefin hydrocarboxylation as a model, we highlight how AP controls product selectivity, yield, and material decomposition. It hinders overreduction, limiting dicarboxylation and electrode passivation, and facilitates a unique electrochemical&#8211;chemical&#8211;chemical (ECC) mechanism.








Abstract
The electrochemical generation of radical anions from feedstock olefins offers a selective and efficient route for synthesizing commodity chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors via hydrofunctionalization. Traditional methods for electrochemical olefin hydrofunctionalization, for example, hydrocarboxylation, rely on anion intermediates and follow an electrochemical&#8211;chemical&#8211;electrochemical&#8211;chemical (ECEC) mechanism involving olefin reduction, carboxylation, further reduction, and protonation. Enhancing terminal carboxylate selectivity often requires a proton source, reducing functional group tolerance and favoring proton reduction over olefin reduction. Alternating polarity, a nascent technique in organic electrochemistry, can improve product selectivity by influencing electron transfer rates and electrode surface species. Herein, we report the use of alternating polarity to selectively generate radical anions from styrene derivatives, using electrochemical hydrocarboxylation as a model. This approach shifts the mechanism to an electrochemical&#8211;chemical&#8211;chemical (ECC) pathway, where the final step involves hydrogen atom transfer. We showcase how alternating polarity modulates product selectivity, yield, and material decomposition, offering new insights into how alternating polarity can advance olefin functionalization by enabling more controlled and selective reaction pathways.

         <title>Aptamer&#8208;Based Galvanic Potentiometric Sensor for Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Serotonin Signaling Under Psychosocial Stress</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphorothioate aptamer&#8208;based galvanic redox potentiometric sensor (aptGRP5&#8208;HT) with enhanced sensitivity and selectivity enables real&#8208;time monitoring of serotonin in a mouse model of psychosocial stress. It reveals, for the first time, a distinct correlation between serotonin release and social hierarchy, with higher serotonin levels in dominant mice.








Abstract
Psychosocial stress, a pervasive factor in mental health disorders, is tightly linked to serotonin (5&#8208;HT) dysregulation. Real&#8208;time electrochemical monitoring of 5&#8208;HT in vivo is challenged by interference from vitamin C (Vc) and biofouling, requiring invasive pretreatments. We present a self&#8208;powered aptamer&#8208;engineered galvanic sensor (aptGRP5&#8208;HT) that integrates phosphorothioate aptamers with a redox potentiometric mechanism, achieving 21.5&#8208;fold higher selectivity and 98.3&#8208;fold enhanced sensitivity against Vc over conventional sensors while resisting electrochemical biofouling. The aptGRP5&#8208;HT operates in complex biological environments without pretreatment, enabling direct monitoring in a rodent psychosocial stress model. Using this tool, we uncover a neurochemical signature of social hierarchy: high&#8208;ranking mice exhibit elevated 5&#8208;HT release in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), with region&#8208;specific correlations to neuronal activity&#8208;reduced spontaneous firing in the mPFC and increased activity in the DRN. This work resolves long&#8208;standing challenges in neurochemical sensing and establishes aptGRP5&#8208;HT as a transformative platform for probing brain function and stress&#8208;related disorders.

&lt;p&gt;A phosphorothioate aptamer-based galvanic redox potentiometric sensor (aptGRP&lt;sub&gt;5-HT&lt;/sub&gt;) with enhanced sensitivity and selectivity enables real-time monitoring of serotonin in a mouse model of psychosocial stress. It reveals, for the first time, a distinct correlation between serotonin release and social hierarchy, with higher serotonin levels in dominant mice.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychosocial stress, a pervasive factor in mental health disorders, is tightly linked to serotonin (5-HT) dysregulation. Real-time electrochemical monitoring of 5-HT in vivo is challenged by interference from vitamin C (Vc) and biofouling, requiring invasive pretreatments. We present a self-powered aptamer-engineered galvanic sensor (aptGRP&lt;sub&gt;5-HT&lt;/sub&gt;) that integrates phosphorothioate aptamers with a redox potentiometric mechanism, achieving 21.5-fold higher selectivity and 98.3-fold enhanced sensitivity against Vc over conventional sensors while resisting electrochemical biofouling. The aptGRP&lt;sub&gt;5-HT&lt;/sub&gt; operates in complex biological environments without pretreatment, enabling direct monitoring in a rodent psychosocial stress model. Using this tool, we uncover a neurochemical signature of social hierarchy: high-ranking mice exhibit elevated 5-HT release in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), with region-specific correlations to neuronal activity-reduced spontaneous firing in the mPFC and increased activity in the DRN. This work resolves long-standing challenges in neurochemical sensing and establishes aptGRP&lt;sub&gt;5-HT&lt;/sub&gt; as a transformative platform for probing brain function and stress-related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Mediated Lithium Recovery From Spent LiFePO4 Stabilizes Ferricyanide Catholyte for Durable Zinc&#8208;Ferricyanide Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;mediated lithium recovery from spent LiFePO4 batteries enables high&#8208;solubility catholytes (up to 1.74&#160;M [Fe(CN)6]4&#8315;) for ultra&#8208;stable alkaline zinc&#8208;ferricyanide flow batteries. This dual&#8208;function strategy integrates sustainable lithium recycling with advanced energy storage, achieving enhanced cycling stability and energy density.








Abstract
The scarcity of lithium resources and the increasing volume of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) exacerbate the imbalance between lithium supply and demand. The development of efficient recovery strategies of valuable lithium ion (Li+) from spent LIBs and their subsequent utilization presents both significant opportunities and challenges. Here, we propose an innovative approach for Li+ recovery from spent lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries (LFPs) and its subsequent utilization in alkaline zinc&#8208;ferricyanide flow batteries (AZFFBs). Utilizing a redox&#8208;mediated reaction, we achieve exceptional Li+ recovery efficiency from spent LFPs. Furthermore, the recovered Li+ in solution leads to the elevated ionic strength in the electrolyte, enhancing the concentration of [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722; to a remarkable level of 1.74&#160;M. Utilizing the above catholyte, an AZFFB cell demonstrates the cycling life extending to 11&#160;000 cycles with a degradation rate as low as 0.00019% per cycle and 0.09% per day at a current density of 120&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This study introduces a straightforward and efficient protocol that eliminates additional intermediate processes, achieving effective Li+ recovery from spent LFPs and subsequent utilization in flow batteries. The resulting AZFFB exhibits high energy density and long lifespan, positioning it as a promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage solutions.

         <title>Insertion of Nitriles Into a Gold(III)/Carbene Bond: A Direct and Powerful Entry to Imino&#8208;Substituted Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable imino&#8208;substituted Au(III) carbenes are easily and efficiently prepared by trapping the transient (N^C^C)Au&#8592;:CH(dmp)+ carbene with nitriles. The corresponding free species are readily generated and display dual carbene / nitrile&#8208;ylide reactivities. The diazo decomposition, nitrile insertion, and carbene transfer can be combined in three&#8208;component Au(III)&#8208;catalyzed transformations.








Abstract
Strikingly, very little is known so far about reactive gold(III) carbenes. They have been proposed as key intermediates in a few reactions but remain chemical curiosities. Taking into account the enhanced electrophilicity of cationic Au(III) carbene complexes, we were intrigued by their reactivity with nitriles. Thus, we discovered a simple and efficient entry to imino&#8208;substituted carbenes. The transient (N^C^C)Au(III)&#8592;:CH(dmp)+ carbene readily reacts with acetonitrile, benzonitrile, and diisopropyl cyanamide, affording stable and isolable Au(III) carbene complexes. Here, the imino group acts either as a strongly &#960;&#8208;donating or a spectator substituent. Ligand exchange at Au(III) or protodeauration/deprotonation provides access to the corresponding free species, which display dual imino&#8208;carbene / nitrile&#8208;ylide reactivity, as substantiated by stoichiometric and catalytic dimerization, O&#9472;H insertion and [3&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reactions.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Meta C&#9472;H Alkoxylation and Amidation via Polarity Reversal of Nucleophilic Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we describe the first example of the use of a nucleophilic reagent, such as an alcohol or amide, to replace the electrophilic reagent during the palladium&#8208;catalyzed meta C&#9472;H alkoxylation or amidation reaction of an arene. The reaction conditions are mild and highly site&#8208;selective, thereby facilitating the direct introduction of natural products or drug molecules containing hydroxyl or amido groups at the meta positions of arenes. In addition, the directing group is rapidly convertible into the corresponding aldehyde, which further enhances the applicability of the reaction. 








Abstract
Norbornene&#8208;mediated remote metaselective C&#9472;H functionalization of arenes have been limited to relatively weakly electronegative and &#8220;soft&#8221; species, such as aryl, alkyl, and alkylamino moieties. Herein, we describe the first example of the use of a nucleophilic reagent, such as an alcohol or amide, to replace the electrophilic reagent during the palladium&#8208;catalyzed meta C&#9472;H alkoxylation or amidation reaction of an arene. The reaction conditions are mild and highly site&#8208;selective, thereby facilitating the direct introduction of natural products or drug molecules containing hydroxyl or amido groups at the meta positions of arenes. In addition, the directing group is rapidly convertible into the corresponding aldehyde, which further enhances the applicability of the reaction. Control experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that alcohol and amide polarity reversal induced by hypervalent iodine reagents and the subsequent formation of a Pd(IV) intermediate via the oxidative addition of the aryl&#8211;norbornyl&#8211;palladacycle intermediate are crucial for promoting the entire catalytic reaction cycle.

         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;entropy and fast&#8208;Li+&#8208;conducting electrolyte with cascade reaction&#8208;induced stabilized interfacial phase and fast Li+ transport kinetics has been designed, and the electrolyte formulation can provide excellent fast cycling performance of lithium metal batteries. This work emphasizes an effective electrolyte design strategy and gives a new design idea to facilitate the practical application of fast&#8208;charging LMBs.








Abstract
Lithium metal is considered the most promising next&#8208;generation anode, while its fast&#8208;charging application is hindered by the problems of dendrite growth and side reactions. Herein, a low&#8208;entropy electrolyte with cascade reaction&#8208;induced stable interphase and fast Li+ transport kinetics is proposed to provide excellent fast&#8208;charging performance of lithium metal batteries. In this electrolyte with an extremely simple formula, only two co&#8208;solvents with a lithium salt are used without any other additives. Fast lithium transport and desolvation kinetics are maintained, owing to the solvents&#8217; low viscosity and weak interaction with lithium. Particularly, the intermediate products of lithium salt can further promote rapid defluorination of the F&#8208;containing solvent to form LiF, constructing a LiF&#8208;rich interphase. Fast Li+ transport kinetics and robust interphase enable the fast&#8208;cycling performance of lithium metal anodes. The Li||Li symmetric cell can even withstand a high current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Good cycling stability under fast charging is also achieved with a capacity of 123 mAh g&#8722;1 maintained with a capacity retention rate reaching 90% after 200 cycles at a charging rate of 6C. Our results demonstrate a simple yet effective electrolyte design strategy facilitating the fast cycling of lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Electrostatic Potential Matching in an Anion&#8208;Pillared Framework for Benchmark Hexafluoroethane Purification from Ternary Mixture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrostatic potential matching in the anion&#8208;pillared SIFSIX&#8208;1&#8208;Cu realizes effective anchoring of CF3CH2F and CF3CHF2 through multiple supramolecular interactions, exhibiting the highest CF3CH2F and CF3CHF2 adsorption capacity as well as unprecedented CF3CH2F/CF3CF3 and CF3CHF2/CF3CF3 selectivity, thereby achieving benchmark separation of ternary CF3CH2F/CF3CHF2/CF3CF3 mixture. 








Abstract
One&#8208;step purification of CF3CF3 from ternary CF3CH2F/CF3CHF2/CF3CF3 mixture is crucial since its vital role in the semiconductor industry. However, efficient separation of chemically inert CF&#8323;CF&#8323; remains challenging due to the difficulty in creating specific recognition sites in porous materials. In this work, we report the first example of anion&#8208;pillared MOFs to the separation of fluorinated electronic specialty gases, utilizing the unique electrostatic potential matching in the bipolar pores of SIFSIX&#8208;1&#8208;Cu to realize a benchmark CF3CH2F/CF3CHF2/CF3CF3 separation. SIFSIX&#8208;1&#8208;Cu exhibits the highest CF3CH2F and CF3CHF2 adsorption capacity at 0.01&#160;bar, as well as the highest CF3CH2F/CF3CF3 and CF3CHF2/CF3CF3 IAST selectivity. Additionally, high&#8208;purity (&#8805; 99.995%) CF3CF3 with record productivity (882.9&#160;L kg&#8722;1) can be acquired through one&#8208;step breakthrough experiment of CF3CH2F/CF3CHF2/CF3CF3 (5/5/90). Theoretical calculations further reveal that the coexistence of electronegative SiF62&#8722; and partially electropositive H sites promotes SIFSIX&#8208;1&#8208;Cu to effectively anchor CF3CH2F and CF3CHF2 through multiple supramolecular interactions.

         <title>Hopping Diffusion in Wiggling Nanopore Architecture of MOF Enabling Synergistic Equilibrium&#8208;Kinetic Separation of Fluorinated Propylene and Propane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address a critical challenge in electronic specialty gas (ESG) purification, we herein present a zirconium&#8208;based MOF with &#8220;wiggling pore geometry&#8221; featuring alternating narrow apertures and enlarged cavities. This architecture establishes an equilibrium&#8208;kinetic synergistic separation mechanism: narrow windows (nw) kinetically hinder C3F8 diffusion (DC3F6/DC3F8&#160;&#8776;&#160;450), while F&#183;&#183;&#183;H interactions in cavities thermodynamically favor C3F6 adsorption.








Abstract
The separation of octafluoropropane (C3F8) from hexafluoropropylene (C3F6) is an industrially important yet challenging process due to their similar physicochemical properties and stringent purity demands in industrial applications. Herein, we address this task through precise pore architecture in a zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (Zr&#8208;PMA), which exhibits unique &#8220;wiggling nanopores&#8221; with narrow windows and large cavities. The narrow windows act as diffusion barriers, selectively restricting C3F8 transport, while the large cavities provide strong adsorption sites for C3F6, enabling an equilibrium&#8208;kinetic synergistic separation. This dual functionality results in a &#8764;450&#8208;fold difference in diffusion rates and exceptional kinetic selectivity for C3F6 over C3F8, as demonstrated by adsorption isotherms, time&#8208;resolved kinetics, and dynamic breakthrough experiments. Theoretical calculations coupled with in situ spectroscopy elucidate the pore geometry&#8208;dependent hopping diffusion mechanism responsible for the separation. This work establishes wiggling pore geometry as a versatile paradigm for advanced adsorbents targeting energy&#8208;efficient separations of structurally similar fluorocarbon mixtures.

         <title>Photocatalytic Hydrogenation of Quinolines To Form 1,2,3,4&#8208;Tetrahdyroquinolines Using Water as the Hydrogen Atom Donor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of a sequential process combining hydrogenation and a subsequent stereomutation is an attractive strategy for the stereoselective reduction of cyclic disubstituted &#960;&#8208;systems to access the thermodynamically more stable trans&#8208;isomer, which would be the minor compound considering a kinetically controlled cis&#8208;hydrogenation process. Herein, we demonstrate stereoselective photocatalytic phosphine&#8208;mediated quinoline reductions with water as the hydrogen atom source under mild conditions to afford the corresponding 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines with complete selectivity towards reduction of the heteroaromatic part. The method shows broad functional group tolerance and provides access to trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;disubstituted tetrahydroquinolines with moderate to excellent diastereoselectivity. These trans&#8208;isomers are not readily obtained using established methods, as transition&#8208;metal catalyzed regioselective quinoline hydrogenations provide the corresponding cis&#8208;2,3&#8208;disubstituted isomers with high selectivity. Mechanistic studies reveal that the hydrogenation of the 2,3&#8208;disubstituted quinolines proceeds through a cascade process comprising an initial cis&#8208;selective photocatalytic hydrogenation of the heteroarene core of the quinoline followed by a trans&#8208;selective photoisomerization.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Luminescent Ion Pair (CLIP) Strategy Enables Amorphous Platinum Complexes Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral ion&#8208;pairing (CIP) has been developed as an effective chirality transfer strategy from chiral ionic species to its achiral counter&#8208;ionic substrate. When the achiral counter&#8208;ions were endowed luminescent property, the resultant chiral luminescent ion pair (CLIP) will open a new window for high&#8208;performance chiral luminescence. In this research, three pairs of CLIP molecules featuring the platinum complexes as achiral cationic luminophore and the chiral anion (CA) as chiral source were constructed. The CLIP molecules demonstrate circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) with quantum yields (&#934;PL) up to 71.5%, dissymmetry factor (gcpp) values of 1.8&#215;10&#8208;2 in amorphous state and gcpp up to &#8208;0.99 in cholesteric liquid crystal. Results show that the chiroptical properties can be assigned to the chirality transfer from the CAs to the formed twisted dimeric or oligomeric self&#8208;assemblies of platinum complex cations. This research presents a new approach for achieving high performance chiral luminescence of amorphous chiral metal complexes, providing a concise model for revealing the chirality transfer in CLIP materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zero thermal expansion is a rare but desirable physical property for materials. Here, we report an unprecedented near&#8208;zero thermal expansion (nZTE) behavior in a two&#8208;dimensional coordination polymer (CP) Cd(1,2,4&#8208;triazole)2 (H2PO4)2 (Cd&#8208;Tz) across a broad temperature range of 25 K &#8208; 400 K. Using multi&#8208;temperature high&#8208;resolution single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, we investigated the structural dynamics of the wine&#8208;rack&#8208;like framework of Cd&#8208;Tz and compared it with that of positive thermal expansion (PTE) CPs Zn&#8208;Tz and Mn&#8208;Tz with similar framework topology. We show that nZTE in Cd&#8208;Tz is a consequence of two monotonic and opposing trends with PTE (&#945;a, &#945;c ~ 22 MK&#8208;1) in the ac plane and negative thermal expansion (NTE) in the b direction (&#945;b ~ &#8208;47 MK&#8208;1). A new mechanism for the uniaxial NTE is established based on concerted out&#8208;of&#8208;plane single atom libration of similarly oriented adjacent triazole rings in the wine&#8208;rack motifs. X&#8208;ray electron density analysis and modelling of low&#8208;temperature vibrational anharmonicity reveals the role of Cd&#8208;triazole bonds and hydrogen bonds in promoting the single atom libration. Tuning the metal&#8722;ligand bonding strength through minor substitution of Zn/Mn (~8/12%) in the Cd&#8208;Tz lattice results in a prominent shift from nZTE to NTE behavior in the solid solution phases.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Zero thermal expansion is a rare but desirable physical property for materials. Here, we report an unprecedented near-zero thermal expansion (nZTE) behavior in a two-dimensional coordination polymer (CP) Cd(1,2,4-triazole)2 (H2PO4)2 (Cd-Tz) across a broad temperature range of 25 K - 400 K. Using multi-temperature high-resolution single-crystal X-ray diffraction, we investigated the structural dynamics of the wine-rack-like framework of Cd-Tz and compared it with that of positive thermal expansion (PTE) CPs Zn-Tz and Mn-Tz with similar framework topology. We show that nZTE in Cd-Tz is a consequence of two monotonic and opposing trends with PTE (&#945;a, &#945;c ~ 22 MK-1) in the ac plane and negative thermal expansion (NTE) in the b direction (&#945;b ~ -47 MK-1). A new mechanism for the uniaxial NTE is established based on concerted out-of-plane single atom libration of similarly oriented adjacent triazole rings in the wine-rack motifs. X-ray electron density analysis and modelling of low-temperature vibrational anharmonicity reveals the role of Cd-triazole bonds and hydrogen bonds in promoting the single atom libration.

         <title>Reverse Regioselective Dicarbofunctionalization via anti&#8208;Michael&#8208;type Addition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vicinal dicarbofunctionalization of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds is a classical yet versatile method for constructing complex molecular architectures in a single step. However, the regioselectivity is typically governed by the electronic properties of the alkene moiety, leading to the introduction of a nucleophile at the &#946;&#8208;position and an electrophile at the &#945;&#8208;position. Herein, we report a palladium&#8208;catalyzed dicarbofunctionalization of acrylamides via anti&#8208;Michael&#8208;type addition, achieving reverse regioselectivity relative to traditional approaches. This strategy enables the efficient incorporation of various (hetero)arene nucleophiles at the &#945;&#8208;position and carbon electrophiles, including iodoarenes, vinyl iodides, and iodomethane, at the &#946;&#8208;position to furnish dicarbofunctionalized amides in good yields. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the reaction proceeds through an alkylpalladium intermediate formed via the &#945;&#8208;addition of a nucleophile.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;in&#8208;acid Strategy for Corrosion&#8208;Free Proton Storage: Phosphoric Acid Electrolyte Engineering Toward Sustainable Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous proton batteries, leveraging the intrinsic advantages of protons such as minimal hydrated radius, natural abundance, and rapid transport kinetics, have emerged as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage. However, conventional strong acid electrolytes like H2SO4 suffer from critical limitations including electrode dissolution and incompatibility with battery components. To circumvent these challenges, weak acids (e.g., HCOOH and H3PO4) have been strategically selected as alternative electrolytes due to their non&#8208;corrosive characteristics. Particularly, the implementation of a high&#8208;concentration "water&#8208;in&#8208;acid" (WIA) effectively suppresses undesirable interactions between electrode materials and free water molecules. Through electrolyte engineering, we developed a 9.5 M H3PO4 WIA system that synergizes with a molybdenum trioxide electrode, achieving remarkable electrochemical performance: a high reversible capacity of 229.8 mAh g&#8208;1 at 3 A g&#8208;1 and exceptional cycling stability with 83.86% capacity retention after 1,000 cycles at 5 A g&#8208;1, surpassing conventional H2SO4&#8208;based systems by both capacity and cyclability. This innovative approach establishes a new paradigm for developing high&#8208;performance aqueous energy storage systems through acid&#8208;dominated electrolyte design.</dc:description>

         <title>A Joyful Journey: Tungsten(VI) and Tungsten(V) Fluorides Meet&#160;N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes and Cyclic (Alkyl)(amino)carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first complexation of tungsten(VI) fluoride with&#160;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) and a cyclic (alkyl)(amino) carbene (cAACMe) is reported, which led to the complexes [(NHC)WF6] (NHC = IiPrMe,&#160;1; BIiPr,&#160;2; IMes,&#160;3; IDipp,&#160;4; and SIDipp,&#160;5) and [(cAACMe)WF&#8326;]&#160;6. Solid&#8208;state structural analysis reveals distorted mono&#8208;capped trigonal prismatic geometries for&#160;2&#160;and&#160;3, whereas&#160;6&#160;adopts a pentagonal bipyramidal coordination. Reduction of&#160;1&#8211;6&#160;with 0.5 equivalents of TMS&#8208;pyMe&#8208;TMS afforded rare tungsten(V) fluoride complexes [(NHC)WF&#8325;] (NHC = IiPrMe,&#160;7; BIiPr,&#160;8; IMes,&#160;9; IDipp,&#160;10&#160;and SIDipp,&#160;11). Reduction of&#160;6&#160;with TMS&#8208;py&#8208;TMS yielded the dinuclear, fluoride&#8208;bridged complex [(cAACMe)WF&#8325;]&#8322;&#160;12. Subsequent addition of a second equivalent cAACMe&#160;to&#160;12&#160;gave the mononuclear&#160;bis&#8208;carbene complex [(cAACMe)&#8322;WF&#8325;]&#160;13. Magnetic susceptibility measurements and EPR spectroscopy confirm a predominantly metal&#8208;centered d&#185; radical in both&#160;12&#160;and&#160;13.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Conducting, Vacancy&#8208;Rich HxIrOy Nanosheets for the Fabrication of Low&#8208;Ionomer&#8208;Dependent Anode Catalyst Layer in PEM Water Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The anode catalyst layer is composed of catalytically functional IrOx and protonic conducting ionomer, and largely dictates catalytic performance of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE). Here, we report a new type of anode nanocatalysts that possesses both IrOx&#8217;s catalytic function and high proton conductivity that traditional anode catalysts lack, and demonstrate its ability to construct high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;ionomer&#8208;dependent anode catalyst layer, the interior of which&#8212;about 85% of total catalyst layer&#8212;is free of ionomers. The proton&#8208;conducting anode nanocatalyst is prepared via protonation of layered iridate K0.5(Na0.2Ir0.8)O2 and then exfoliation to produce cation vacancies&#8208;rich, 1 nm&#8208;thick iridium oxide nanosheets (labeled as &#9633;&#8208;HxIrOy). Besides being a proton conductor, the &#9633;&#8208;HxIrOy is found to have abundant catalytic active sites for the oxygen evolution reaction due to the optimization of both edge and in&#8208;plane iridium sites by multiple cation vacancies. The dual functionality of &#9633;&#8208;HxIrOy allows the fabrication of low&#8208;iridium&#8208;loading, low&#8208;ionomer&#8208;dependent anode catalyst layer with enhanced exposure of catalytic sites and reduced electronic contact resistance, in contrast to common fully mixed catalyst/ionomer layer in PEMWE. This work represents an example of realizing the structural innovation in anode catalyst layer through the bifunctionality of anode catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Proteome&#8208;Wide Data Guides the Discovery of Lysine&#8208;Targeting Covalent Inhibitors Using DNA&#8208;Encoded Chemical Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Broadening the application of covalent inhibitors requires the exploration of nucleophilic residues beyond cysteine. The covalent DNA&#8208;encoded chemical library (CoDEL) represents an advanced technology for covalent drug discovery. However, its application in lysine&#8208;targeting inhibitors remains uncharted territory. Here, we report the utilization of CoDEL selection guided by proteome&#8208;wide data to identify lysine&#8208;targeting covalent inhibitors. A comprehensive assessment of activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP) data on lysine distribution and ligandability reveals potential targets for selective covalent inhibition, including phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1), bromodomain (BRD) family proteins, and ubiquitin&#8208;conjugating enzyme E2 N (UBE2N). The 10.7&#8208;million&#8208;member CoDELs, featuring diverse lysine&#8208;reactive warheads, enables the discovery of a series of covalent inhibitors, covering photo&#8208;covalent, reversible covalent, and irreversible covalent reaction mechanisms. In&#8208;depth characterization of binding sites and modes of action provides structural and functional insights. Notably, irreversible covalent inhibitors unveil a novel mechanism for regulating UBE2N&#8208;mediated ubiquitination by modulating the conformation of the protein complex. Our work adopts the ABPP&#8208;CoDEL strategy, offering an efficient and versatile selection method for the development of covalent inhibitors targeting functional lysines.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterizing Disorders within Cathode Materials of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The demand for developing high&#8208;energy density cathode materials has been increasing. The energy densities of cathode materials have been improved by adapting structural deviation from the ideal fully ordered &#945;&#8208;NaFeO2 type, but that led to limitations in terms of structural stability and safety. Although disorders in cathode materials are closely related to their electrochemical properties, unfortunately, characterizing the disorder itself in cathode materials has been challenging due to its complex parasitic reaction and strong correlation with other disorders occurring during charge/discharge. In this review, we categorize various disorders by their scales of ordering from short&#8208;range to long&#8208;range. We addressed the principles of various characterization tools to figure out how they can help to identify the structural disorder in cathode materials. Specifically, we focused on the underlying principles of each characterization technique to correlate different disorder&#8208;driven phenomena through several case studies. It underscores the substantial importance of disorder&#8208;property relationships and the corresponding characterization methods, which can provide novel research strategies for developing high&#8208;energy density cathode materials with decent structural stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformationally Locked Peptide&#8208;DNA Nanostructures for CRISPR&#8208;Amplified Activity&#8208;Based Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We introduce a new class of chemical probes for activity&#8208;based sensing of proteases, termed Cleavable, Locked Initiator Probes (CLIPs). CLIPs contain a protease&#8208;cleavable peptide linked between two programmable DNA strands &#8211; an &#8220;initiator&#8221; DNA and a shorter &#8220;blocking&#8221; DNA. These DNA sequences are designed to hybridize, creating a &#8220;locked&#8221; hairpin&#8208;like structure. Upon proteolytic cleavage, the initiator strand is released, triggering the activation of CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a enzymes and producing an amplified fluorescence response. CLIPs generate more than 20&#8208;fold turn&#8208;on signals at room temperature (25&#176;C), significantly outperforming commercial probes by yielding ~40&#8208;fold lower limits of detection (LOD) at 100&#8208;fold lower concentrations. Their versatility enables the detection of various disease&#8208;relevant proteases &#8211; including the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease, caspase&#8208;3, matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;7, and cathepsin B &#8211; simply by altering the peptide sequence. Importantly, CLIPs detect cathepsin B in four different colorectal cancer cell lines, highlighting their clinical potential. Taken together, the sensitivity (LOD: ~88 pM), selectivity, and rapid assay time (down to 35 minutes), combined with the ability to operate in complex biological media with minimal sample preparation, position CLIPs as powerful chemical tools for activity&#8208;based sensing of functional enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Geometry&#8208;Property Relationship of Benzodipyrrole&#8208;Based A&#8208;DA'D&#8208;A Type Acceptors for High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular geometry plays a crucial role in determining photovoltaic&#160;properties of organic semiconductor materials for organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, we used dichlorine&#8208;substituted benzene as the A&#8217; unit in A&#8208;DA'D&#8208;A type small molecule acceptors (SMAs) and synthesized&#160;four isomers of the benzodipyrrole&#8208;based SMAs (C&#8208;Cl46&#8208;Cl, &#577;&#8208;Cl46&#8208;Cl, M&#8208;Cl46&#8208;Cl and S&#8208;Cl46&#8208;Cl) with C, &#577;, M, and S molecular geometries, and the effect of the molecular geometry on their photovoltaic performance was studied. We revealed that the molecular geometry influences the physicochemical and photovoltaic properties in three aspects: (1) intrinsic physicochemical properties, including energy levels, absorption and reorganization energy; (2) molecular stacking pattern, which govern the exciton diffusion and charge transport process; and (3) donor&#8208;acceptor interaction and miscibility. We found that the C&#8208;shaped molecular geometry possesses suitable energy level and absorption range, dense and ordered molecular stacking, and improved donor&#8208;acceptor interactions and miscibility. These advantages enable a record&#8208;high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.94% (certified as 19.54%) for the binary OSCs based on D18:C&#8208;Cl46&#8208;Cl active layer. The other shaped SMAs showed weaknesses in different aspects, such as limited absorption of &#577;&#8208;shaped SMA, large reorganization energies and loose molecular stacking of M&#8208;shaped SMA, low solubility and strong aggregation of S&#8208;shaped SMA.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving High Fill Factor via Increasing Interfacial Disorder to Inhibit Bimolecular Recombination for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The inferior fill factor (FF) is one of main reasons impeding further improvement of power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in organic solar cells (OSCs). But no theoretical framework for high FFs has been established yet. Herein, an efficient strategy is developed to enhance FFs via introducing a small molecule, CNDT, into active layer to increase electron donor/acceptor interface disorder, raise energy barrier for charge back transfer, and thus reduce bimolecular recombination rate constant (krec). CNDTs tend to distribute over donor/acceptor interfaces and disturb molecular stacking of Y6 to deliver more disordered donor/acceptor interfaces but higher crystal quality in the D18:Y6+ blend film, compared to D18:Y6. Altogether, in the D18:Y6+ blend film, a higher energy of charge transfer state magnifies energy barrier for charge recombination to decrease charge recombination rate/ratio and reduce krec, inhibiting bimolecular recombination in devices. Therefore, FFs of OSCs are improved from 75.78% (D18:Y6) to 81.13% (D18:Y6+), yielding a higher PCE of 19.45%. Moreover, D18:L8&#8208;BO+ based OSCs feature FFs over 83%, a record for OSCs so far. PCE increases subsequently to 19.80%. It demonstrates that increasing interface disorder without sacrificing crystal quality enhances energy barrier of charge recombination and inhibits bimolecular recombination to efficiently improve FFs for higher PCEs.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving a Highly Reversible Four&#8208;electron Redox of S/Cu2S for Aqueous Zn/S&#8208;Cu Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of sulfur (S) cathode with Cu2+/Cu+ redox carriers has been considered as a promising cathode for the next&#8208;generation aqueous energy storage device due to the high specific capacity (two&#8208;step four&#8208;electron conversion), intrinsic safety, and low cost. Nevertheless, the unsatisfactory cycling stability of Sulfur&#8208;Copper (S&#8208;Cu) cathode hinders its practical application. Herein, the two&#8208;step four&#8208;electron conversions are firstly decoupled in our study, identifying the inferior conversion reversibility between the charging intermedia CuS and the final product S as the primary cause for deteriorate cycling capability. Concerning the different hydrated dimensions of the Cu(H2O)62+ and Cu(H2O)2+, the strategy of "spatial confinement" is proposed to alter the oxidation path of Cu2S and prevent the formation of the intermedia CuS. To ensure the efficient S incorporation into the spatially confined carbon matrix, chalcogen element selenium (Se) is employed to "cut" the S8 into short&#8208;chain molecules. Consequently, the well&#8208;designed S&#8208;Cu cathode achieves one&#8208;step four&#8208;electron reaction and exhibits superior electrochemical stability with an average capacity attenuation of 0.034% during 700 cycles. Our study provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the conversion mechanism for the S&#8208;Cu cathode within the spatial&#8208;confinement environment, and renders valuable insights for developing advanced conversion&#8208;type cathodes in aqueous energy&#8208;storage device.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoelectrochemical Iron(III) Catalysis for Late&#8208;Stage C&#8211;H Fluoroalkylations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemo&#8208; and site&#8208;selective functionalization of complex molecules poses a fundamental challenge. In this regard, the synergetic combination of photoexcitation with electron transfer by anodic oxidation bears unique potential for novel reaction manifolds that go beyond individual photo&#8208; or electrochemistry.[1&#8208;3] Herein, we introduce a resource&#8208;economic photoelectrocatalysis strategy to enable versatile direct fluoroalkylations catalyzed by Earth&#8208;abundant iron and paired with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Notably, the devised approach proved amenable to versatile late&#8208;stage C&#8211;H fluoroalkylations of bio&#8208;relevant heterocycles, such as xanthines, nucleobases, and nucleosides.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chemo- and site-selective functionalization of complex molecules poses a fundamental challenge. In this regard, the synergetic combination of photoexcitation with electron transfer by anodic oxidation bears unique potential for novel reaction manifolds that go beyond individual photo- or electrochemistry.[1-3] Herein, we introduce a resource-economic photoelectrocatalysis strategy to enable versatile direct fluoroalkylations catalyzed by Earth-abundant iron and paired with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Notably, the devised approach proved amenable to versatile late-stage C&#8211;H fluoroalkylations of bio-relevant heterocycles, such as xanthines, nucleobases, and nucleosides. Mechanistic studies supported a ligand-to-metal charge transfer-induced formation of the fluoroalkyl radical.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spider Eye Development Editing and Silk Fiber Engineering Using CRISPR&#8208;Cas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 gene editing represents an effective and precise technology to induce mutations in the genome, and it has been applied to a wide range of organisms for diverse purposes. However, CRISPR&#8208;based gene editing in spiders has not been reported to date. In this study, we demonstrate CRISPR&#8208;mediated microinjection in parental spiders leading to both knock&#8208;out (KO) and knock&#8208;in (KI) mutations within the spider&#8217;s offspring. The KO of the gene sine oculis causes total eye loss, confirming the role of the gene in the development of all spider eyes. The knock&#8208;in of a monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP&#8208;KI) within a spider silk gene encoding one compound of the major ampullate silk of the spider Parasteatoda tepidariorum yields red fluorescent silk fibers. This finding demonstrates the feasibility of functionalizing silk proteins in spiders using CRISPR&#8208;based gene editing without influencing silk assembly. Our study expands the application of CRISPR to spiders and provides insights in the fields of developmental genetics as well as material sciences.</dc:description>

         <title>Remote Silyl Groups Enhance Hydrolytic Stability and Photocleavage Efficiency in Carbamates for Protein Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocleavable molecules are valuable tools for biological studies, enabling spatiotemporal activation of molecular functions within cellular environments. In particular, coumarin&#8208;based photolytic molecules are useful because of their ability to flexibly tune the wavelength of photostimulation through their structural modifications. Ideal photocleavable molecular tools require hydrolytic stability and selective susceptibility to photo stimuli. However conventional coumarin&#8208;based molecules have not simultaneously achieved both highly efficient photocleavage and hydrolysis resistance. Herein, we proposed a novel molecular design concept that introduces a silyl group into coumarin&#8208;based molecules at a position remote from the photolabile bond, creating an ideal photocleavable molecule for chemical biology tools. The established orbital effect of the remotely introduced silyl group improves the photolysis efficiency of coumarin&#8208;based molecules, while its bulkiness substantially enhances their hydrolytic stability in aqueous environments and under enzymatic conditions. Furthermore, this improvement in molecular functionality contributes to the development of high&#8208;performance protein&#8208;release biomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolated and Paired Metal Sites in Zeolites using Solid&#8208;State Ion Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isolated and paired extraframework transition metal cations in zeolites are emerging as top candidates for numerous applications not limited to selective methane oxidation to methanol, selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides, propane dehydrogenation, propylene epoxidation, and direct air capture of carbon dioxide. Importantly, these well&#8208;defined heterogeneous catalysts offer parallels with molecular and metalloenzyme catalytic active sites. Aqueous&#8208;phase ion exchange (APIE) is the most common synthesis technique to obtain these catalysts. Solid&#8208;state ion exchange (SSIE) is an often&#8208;overlooked technique that offers synthetic advantages compared to APIE. Thus, recent advances in solid&#8208;state synthesis strategies merit contemporary contextualization. In this minireview we describe the basic principles, methods, mechanisms, challenges, and advances in&#160;solid&#8208;state ion exchange in the context of&#160;well&#8208;defined transition metal cation&#160;active sites located in extraframework positions of the zeolite.</dc:description>

         <title>Wearing Gigantic Silver Armor on Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Containing Polyoxometalates: Formation of Supertetrahedral Intercluster Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Comparing to versatile polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;templated Ag clusters, the construction of closed Ag clusters using transition&#8208;metal&#8208;containing polyoxometalates (TMCPOMs) as anionic templates have, to our knowledge, never been reported. In this work, we have synthesized three TMCPOM&#8208;templated gigantic closed Ag clusters, [{(Co0.58W0.42)3(OH)3(Ag0.5O3)(SiW9O34)}4@Ag114Br4(tBuC&#8801;C)72]&#183; [SiW12O40]2&#183;10CH3CN (1), [{(Cu0.58W0.42)3(OH)3(Ag0.5O3)(SiW9O34)}4@Ag114Br4 (tBuC&#8801;C)72]&#183;[SiW12O40]2 (2), and [{(Co0.58W0.42)3(OH)3 (Ag0.5O3)(GeW9O34)}4@Ag114Br4(tBuC&#8801;C)72]&#183;[GeW12O40]2 (3), using a universal one&#8208;pot solvothermal synthetic approach. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses demonstrate that the high&#8208;nuclearity transition metal&#8208;containing (M=Co/Cu) POMs with idealized Td symmetry are closely covered by gigantic Ag armors, representing the largest TMCPOM&#8208;templated closed Ag clusters to date. Moreover, compounds 1&#8722;3 can form interesting supertetrahedral intercluster packing structures through Columbic and hydrogen bonding interactions between the cationic TMCPOM&#8208;templated gigantic {Ag114} clusters and the counter [XW12O40]4&#8722; (X=Si/Ge) anions. Upon light irradiation, all three compounds exhibited decent photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity which is dependent on their different electronic structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering Complex Electrochemical Reaction Dynamics and Interactions of Single Nano&#8208;Entities via Evanescent Scattering Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical reactions at the nanoscale are governed by intricate surface interactions, yet existing imaging techniques often lack the surface sensitivity and throughput needed to resolve these dynamics clearly. Here, we introduce electrochemical evanescent scattering microscopy (EC&#8208;ESM), a high&#8208;throughput, surface&#8208;sensitive imaging technique that enables real&#8208;time tracking of single&#8208;nanoentity electrochemistry with high resolution. Using EC&#8208;ESM, we monitored the motion and dissolution dynamics of silver nanoparticles and identified a clear relationship between nanoparticle velocity and electron transfer rates. The high throughput of EC&#8208;ESM not only ensures statistical reliability but also allows the detection of rare electron transfer events in molecularly modified AgNPs. Additionally, EC&#8208;ESM&#8217;s high resolution enabled direct imaging of both single and interacting silver nanowires, revealing diverse dissolution behaviors that provide insights into structural and surface properties. We envision EC&#8208;ESM as a powerful platform for advancing nanoscale electrochemical research and interfacial charge transfer studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide Enabled by Tri&#8208;coordinated Cobalt Sites in Silicate&#8208;1 Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via metal&#8208;catalyzed two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8208; ORR) emerges as a sustainable alternative to the traditional anthraquinone method. However, metal catalysts are commonly supported by graphitic carbon that are susceptible to be oxidized by reactive oxygen species generated in ORR and have limited oxygen capacities. Here, we report a silica based electrocatalyst embedding cobalt (Co) sites into silicate&#8208;1 (S&#8208;1) zeolite, which exhibited exceptional 2e&#8208; ORR performance. The aligned microporosity of S&#8208;1 zeolite highly isolated Co sites to derive a specific tri&#8208;coordination unit of Co(OSi)3 moiety. The nanochannels of S&#8208;1 zeolite further provide robust and substantial reaction spaces, where the Co(OSi)3 moiety facilitates O2 chemisorption and holds moderate bonding with *OOH intermediates to reduce the barrier of H2O2 formation. It achieved high Faradaic efficiency over 96% and a steady yield of 11.56 mol gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 in a gas diffusion electrode setup. This work provides a novel insight into 2e&#8208; ORR on Co sites and highlights the potential of zeolite&#8208;based materials for electrochemical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Conversion of Hydrogen Peroxide and Benzaldehyde in Air by Silver Single&#8208;Atom Modified Thiophene&#8208;Functionalized g&#8208;C3N4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study reports the synthesis of silver single&#8208;atom&#8208;loaded thiophene&#8208;conjugated carbon nitride ( Ag@T&#8208;C3N4), a material with high carrier concentration and efficient carrier separation. Under visible light, Ag@T&#8208;C3N4 catalyzes hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production and benzyl alcohol oxidation to benzaldehyde, achieving production rates of 4729.82 &#181;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 for H2O2 and 19.71 mmol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 for benzaldehyde. The synergy between thiophene conjugation and silver atoms extends visible light absorption and accelerates the 2&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), enhancing H2O2 yield. Photogenerated holes oxidize benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, while the biphasic benzaldehyde&#8208;water system enables spontaneous product separation. In situ Raman spectroscopy, rotating disk electrode testing, EPR, GC&#8208;MS, and DFT calculations highlight the critical role of thiophene&#8208;silver synergy in optimizing reaction pathways, enhancing catalyst&#8208;intermediate interactions, and reducing Gibbs free energy, improving H2O2 and benzaldehyde synthesis. This study provides new insights for designing carbon nitride&#8208;based photocatalysts and offers a strategy for co&#8208;producing value&#8208;added chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating Ambient Ionization Mass Spectrometry Imaging and Spatial Transcriptomics on the Same Cancer Tissues to Identify Gene&#8208;Metabolite Correlations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Innovations in spatial omics technologies applied to human tissues have led to breakthrough discoveries in various diseases, including cancer. Two of these approaches &#8208; spatial transcriptomics and spatial metabolomics &#8208; have blossomed independently, fueled by technologies such as spatial transcriptomics (ST) and mass spectrometry imaging (MSI). While powerful, these technologies only offer insights into the spatial distributions of restricted classes of molecules and have not yet been integrated to provide more holistic insights into biological questions. These techniques can be performed on adjacent serial sections from the same sample, but section&#8208;to&#8208;section variability can convolute data integration. We present a novel method combining desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (DESI&#8208;MSI) spatial metabolomics and Visium spatial transcriptomics on the same tissue sections. We show that RNA quality is maintained after performing DESI&#8208;MSI on a tissue and that ST data is unperturbed following DESI&#8208;MSI. We demonstrate this workflow on human breast and lung cancer tissues and identify novel correlations between metabolites and RNA transcripts in cancer specific regions.</dc:description>

         <title>An A&#8208;T Hoogsteen Base Pair in a Naked DNA Hairpin Motif: A Protein&#8208;Recognized Conformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In duplex DNA, A&#8208;T and G&#8208;C form Watson&#8208;Crick base pairs, and Hoogsteen pairing only dominates upon protein binding or DNA damage. Using NMR, we show that an A&#8208;T Hoogsteen base pair previously observed in crystal structures of transposon DNA hairpins bound to TnpA protein forms in solution even in the absence of TnpA. This Hoogsteen base pair, located adjacent to a dinucleotide apical loop, exists in dynamic equilibrium with a minor Watson&#8208;Crick conformation (population ~11% and lifetime ~55 &#181;s). Extending the apical loop to three residues inverted the equilibrium, making Watson&#8208;Crick the dominant state and the Hoogsteen conformation recognized by TnpA a minor state (population ~14% and lifetime ~28 &#181;s). The propensity for Hoogsteen pairing depended on apical loop residues, which form contacts directly or indirectly stabilizing the Hoogsteen conformation. A structure survey did not reveal Hoogsteen pairing near RNA apical loops making them unique to DNA. Our results demonstrate that Hoogsteen can be the dominant state even in naked unmodified duplex DNA and identify 5&#8217;&#8208;CTT(T/C)AG&#8208;3&#8217; as a DNA&#8208;specific apical loop motif stabilized by Hoogsteen pairing. Hoogsteen conformations may be prevalent in DNA hairpins forming during replication and transcription, with broad implications for the genomic landscape.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral Caged Hydrocarbons as Arenes Bioisosteres</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The utilization of caged hydrocarbons as bioisosteres for arenes, especially the phenyl ring, in bioactive compounds has resulted in significant enhancements in potency, solubility, and metabolic stability. These improvements highlight the potential of C(sp3)&#8208;rich polycyclic scaffolds as a promising motif for the development of drug candidates. However, this strategy has also increased the structural complexity of these molecules, posing synthetic challenges in controlling the chirality of caged and highly decorated bioactive scaffolds. Over the past two years, remarkable progress has been achieved in catalytic asymmetric methodologies for the synthesis of caged hydrocarbons, significantly advancing their utility in chiral drug discovery and development. This Minireview provides a comprehensive summary of recent breakthroughs in the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of chiral caged hydrocarbons, encompassing bicyclo[n.1.1]alkanes, cubanes, and related three&#8208;dimensional scaffolds. Additionally, we highlight the intriguing applications of enantiomerically pure caged hydrocarbons in biological studies. It is anticipated that this Minireview will inspire further advancements in the enantioselective synthesis of these pharmaceutically valuable caged hydrocarbons.</dc:description>

         <title>Neighboring Carbon Defects Enhanced Molecular Oxygen Activation of Cobalt Single Atom Catalysts towards Efficient Aerobic Alcohols Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The effective adsorption and activation of molecular oxygen (O2) is crucial for aerobic alcohols oxidation, however, flexibly modulating the electronic structure of catalysts to improve the capability remains challenging. Herein the concentration of carbon defects surrounding the nitrogen coordinated cobalt (Co) single atoms on candle soot are controlled just through adjusting the amount of polyethyleneimine which chemically decorates the surface of candle soot to anchor Co ions. The concentration increase of carbon defects boosts the aerobic alcohols oxidation over the Co single&#8208;atom catalyst as well as ruthenium single&#8208;atom catalyst. Moreover, a series of alcohols including those with sensitive groups reach an outstanding yield. Significantly, the calculations and experiments verify that the carbon defects lead to the rearrangement of d&#8208;orbitals of Co atom and an elevation in the spin states of dyz and dz2&#160;orbitals. Furthermore, compared with low&#8208;spin Co atom, the stronger electron&#8208;transfer interaction between high&#8208;spin Co atom and O2 enhances the adsorption and activation of O2 and the generation of more superoxide radicals to promote alcohols oxidation. Our findings provide a new way for developing advanced single&#8208;atom catalysts for sustainable aerobic alcohols oxidation via manipulating the spin configurations of single atoms.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic Methanol Activation on Hexagonal CdS for Triggering C&#8211;H Methylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;driven methanol activation paves the way for pursuing C&#8211;H methylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes, where selectively converting methanol into the corresponding hydroxymethyl radical (&#8226;CH2OH) is an essential prerequisite. Inspired by the versatile methanol activation on photoexcited solids, we here report a practicable semiconductor&#8208;based photocatalytic system for C&#8211;H methylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes. To be specific, hexagonal cadmium sulfide (h&#8208;CdS) was identified to be an ideal platform for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic methanol activation, where selective &#8226;CH2OH generation undergoing a hole&#8208;transfer process without any additional co&#8208;catalysts or co&#8208;solvent could trigger C&#8211;H hydroxymethylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes. The following electron transfer between photoexcited h&#8208;CdS and hydroxymethylated intermediates could finally lead to the formation of methylated N&#8208;heteroarenes. The transformations facilitate the cascade utilization of photoinduced hole and electron, thereby endowing h&#8208;CdS with extraordinary photocatalytic performance. Besides, selective generation of hydroxymethylated/methylated product could be facilely implemented in the presence/absence of electron scavengers.</dc:description>

         <title>Tumor Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Polymer Delivery Platforms for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most chemotherapeutic and bioimaging agents struggle with inadequate bioavailability, primarily due to their limited biocompatibility and lack of specificity in targeting, leading to low or decreased anticancer efficacy and inaccurate imaging. To surmount these obstacles, the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive polymer delivery platforms, predominantly leveraging the tumor microenvironment (TME), has emerged as a promising strategy. Therapeutic and diagnostic agents can be released controllably at the tumor site by virtue of the bond cleavage or hydrophobic to hydrophilic transformation of TME&#8208;sensitive linkages in TME&#8208;responsive systems, thus augmenting cancer treatment and imaging precision, while simultaneously attenuating the damage to healthy tissues and false imaging signals caused by non&#8208;specific drug leakage. In this comprehensive review, we scrutinize recent studies of TME&#8208;responsive polymer delivery platforms, encompassing pH&#8208;, ROS&#8208;, GSH&#8208;, enzyme&#8208;, and hypoxia&#8208;responsive vectors, significantly from the perspective of their molecular design and responsive mechanism, and further summarizing their bio&#8208;application in drug delivery and diagnostic imaging. Moreover, this review encapsulates the critical challenges and offers an insightful perspective on the future prospects of TME&#8208;responsive polymer delivery platforms in terms of molecular and vector design.</dc:description>

         <title>Through&#8208;Space 1,4&#8208;Ni/H Shift: Unlocking Migration Along Coupling Partners in Olefin Borylcarbofunctionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Olefin migratory functionalization is a well&#8208;established strategy for the selective installation of functional groups at remote C(sp3)&#8722;H positions along an alkyl chain. However, prior research has predominantly focused on migration along the alkene component. Herein, we describe a conceptually new migratory coupling strategy for the difunctionalization of alkenes, where migration selectively occurs along the C(sp2) coupling partner rather than the alkene component, facilitated by a through&#8208;space 1,4&#8208;Ni/H shift. This approach offers a modular three&#8208;component strategy for the selective and efficient construction of densely functionalized alkyl boronates from readily accessible chemicals. Moreover, by integrating the 1,2&#8208;Ni/H shift with the 1,4&#8208;Ni/H shift, this platform has been expanded to achieve a two&#8208;fold migration along both the alkene components and the coupling partners, facilitating selective borylative remote C(sp3)&#8211;H/C(sp2)&#8211;H cross&#8208;coupling.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Active Hydrogen Supply and O2 Adsorption: Sulfur Vacancy Matters for Boosting H2O2 Photosynthesis Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8211;&#160;ORR) represents a promising approach for H2O2 production. However, the lack of photocatalysts with appropriate O2 adsorption and hydrogenation capabilities impedes the H2O2 production performance. Herein, we report the synthesis of Ni&#8208;doped ZnS hollow nanocubes with S vacancies (Ni&#8208;ZnS&#8208;Sv)&#160;as a dual&#8208;site 2e&#8211; ORR photocatalyst for efficient H2O2 production. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations reveal the vital roles of Sv in modulating the electronic structures of Ni and S dual sites toward enhanced 2e&#8211; ORR selectivity and activity. The atomically dispersed Ni sites with electron&#8208;rich state enable a Pauling&#8208;type (end&#8208;on) O2 adsorption configuration and a modest binding strength of O2 and OOH*, largely avoiding the O&#8208;O bond cleavage. Besides, the formation of electron&#8208;deficient S sites weakens the S&#8208;Hads bond, facilitating the *Hads migration to adjacent Ni sites and accelerating the hydrogenation kinetics of O2 to OOH* intermediate. As a result, the elaborately designed Ni&#8208;ZnS&#8208;Sv photocatalyst exhibits a high H2O2 yield of 5649.49 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 under UV&#8208;vis light irradiation in pure water. Our work offers new insights into the design principles of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts for artificial H2O2 photosynthesis systems.</dc:description>

         <title>A &#8220;Flexible&#8221; Solvent Molecule Enabling High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strong hydrogen bonding interactions between the BTF diluent and the 2,5&#8208;THF solvent result in an expansion of the bond angle in the 2,5&#8208;THF molecules. This structural alteration increases the steric hindrance of 2,5&#8208;THF, while simultaneously reducing its polarity. Consequently, the anion ratio within the solvation structure of the electrolyte is elevated, which enhances the electrochemical performance of both the lithium metal anode and the sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathode.







Abstract
Electrolyte chemistries are crucial for achieving high cycling performance and high energy density in lithium metal batteries. The localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) exhibit good performance in lithium metal batteries. However, understanding how the intermolecular interactions between solvents and diluents in the electrolyte regulate the solvation structure and interfacial layer structure remains limited. Here, we reported a new LHCE in which strong hydrogen bonding between diluents and solvents alters the conformation and polarity of &#8220;flexible&#8221; solvent molecules, thereby effectively regulating the solvation structure of Li+ ion and promoting the formation of robust electrode interfaces. The endpoint H of the &#8220;flexible&#8221; chain O&#8208;CH&#8208;CH3 of the 2,5&#8208;dimethyltetrahydrofuran (2,5&#8208;THF) solvent and the F of the benzotrifluoride (BTF) diluent can form strong hydrogen bonds, which expand the maximum bond angle of the 2,5&#8208;THF molecule from 119&#176; to 123&#176;. The expanded bond angle increases the steric hindrance of the 2,5&#8208;THF molecule and decreases its polarity. This leads to an increase in the anion content within the solvation structure, which in turn enhances the performance of both the lithium metal anode and the sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) cathode. As a result, the lithium metal anode shows a Coulombic efficiency (CE) of as high as 99.4&#8201;%. The assembled Li||SPAN battery based on our developed LHCE exhibits impressive stability with an average CE of 99.8&#8201;% over 700 cycles. Moreover, the Li||SPAN pouch cell can be stably cycled with a high energy density of 301.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. This molecular&#8208;level understanding of the correlation between molecular interactions and solvation structures provides new insights into the design of advanced LHCEs for high&#8208;performance lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Logic&#8208;Gated DNA Intelligent Nanorobots for Cellular Lysosome Interference and Enhanced Therapeutics</title>

Logic&#8208;gated intelligent DNA nanorobots are engineered for cascade responses to extra&#8208;/intra&#8208;cellular microenvironmental factors (K+ and H+), enabling targeted cargo delivery, lysosomal interference, and enhanced cancer therapy.







Abstract
Environment&#8208;recognizing DNA nanodevices have proven promising for cellular manipulation and disease treatment, whereas how to sequentially respond to different cellular microenvironments remains a challenge. To this end, here we elaborate a logic&#8208;gated intelligent DNA nanorobot (Gi&#8208;DR) for the cascade response to inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;cellular microenvironments, thereby achieving lysosome&#8208;targeted cargo delivery for subcellular interference and tumor treatment with enhanced efficacy. Utilizing G&#8208;quadruplexes to respond to high&#8208;level K+ in cancer cell surrounding, this Gi&#8208;DR nanorobot can activate an aptamer&#8208;based transmembrane DNA machine that delivers molecular payloads to cellular lysosome. Accordingly, the nanoassembly of Gi&#8208;DR is promoted by the folding of heterodimeric i&#8208;motifs in the acidic microenvironment. Such a design allows the extra&#8208;/intra&#8208;cellular behaviors of the Gi&#8208;DR nanorobot to be programmed by an YES&#8208;AND logic circuit, with environmental K+ and H+ as two inputs. As a consequence, DNA nanostrips are controllably formed in living cells, interfering with lysosomal function and thereby preventing cellular proliferation. Further, a therapeutic agent (i.e. ligand&#8208;drug conjugate) is delivered into target cancer cells for synergistic tumor treatment in vivo, exhibiting the super&#8208;enhanced cancer cell lethality and anti&#8208;tumor efficacy. It well illustrates that our designed logic&#8208;gated DNA nanorobot has broad application prospects in modulating cellular function and precision disease treatment.

         <title>Manipulating Dynamic Light&#8208;Driven Solid&#8208;Liquid Transition and Static Reversible Photochromism by an Organic Cocrystal Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of a supramolecular assembly strategy for charge&#8208;transfer cocrystal system allows realization of a dynamic photo&#8208;responsive solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid phase transition as well as reversible photochromic behavior, in particular a time&#8208;dependent green&#8208;fading&#8208;yellow fluorescence variation during UV irradiation. These properties allow potential application in photoactivated anti&#8208;counterfeiting functional materials.







Abstract
Developing of molecular crystalline materials with light&#8208;induced multiple dynamic deformation in space dimension and photochromism on time scales has attracted much attention for its potential applications in actuators, sensoring and information storage. Nevertheless, organic crystals capable of both photoinduced dynamic effects and static color change are rare, particularly for multi&#8208;component cocrystal system. In this study, we first report the construction of charge transfer cocrystal allows their light&#8208;induced solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transition and photochromic behaviors to be controlled by trans&#8208;stilbene (TSB) as an electron donor and 3,4,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorophthalonitrile (TFP) as an electron acceptor. In this case, the dynamic photo&#8208;responsive solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid phase transition is due to the photoisomerization of TSB under UV light irradiation, while the accumulation of melted droplets during solid&#8208;state photochemical process causes mechanical deformation of TSB&#8208;TFP cocrystals. The subsequent reversible photochromic behavior is attributed to the emergence of free radicals through a photo&#8208;induced electron transfer. Moreover, TSB&#8208;TFP microcrystals present typical excitation wavelength dependent emission (EWDE) fluorescence by surfactant&#8208;mediated method. This work realizes the dynamic&#8208;static photochemical cascade processes in response to UV light irradiation in an organic cocrystal system, providing the effective method for a new type of smart photo&#8208;responsive materials.

         <title>A Strategy of Enhancing Polarization to Achieve Excellent Energy Storage Performance in Simple Bi0.5K0.5TiO3&#8208;Based Relaxors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhancing the polarization of relaxors necessitates large local polarization and high breakdown field strength. Dielectrics with low hysteresis are obtained via the chemical regulation for Bi0.5K0.5TiO3 with substantial local polarity. Large polarization is released at a high electric field, thereby achieving exceptional dielectric energy&#8208;storage performance. The mechanism of its high performance is also elucidated through the local structure analysis at the atomic scale.







Abstract
Dielectric energy storage capacitors are indispensable components in advanced electronic and electrical systems. Excellent performance requires the dielectric materials possessing low residual polarization (Pr), high breakdown strength (Eb), and large maximum polarization (Pm). The first two parameters can be typically achieved through chemical regulation, while the Pmax is closely related to the matrix. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that a strong coupling of A&#8208;O bonds and a large lattice can enhance polarization, thus identifying the prototype Bi0.5K0.5TiO3 as a favorable matrix. Here, ultrahigh energy density of 16.5&#8197;J/cm3 and high efficiency of 88.2&#8201;% are achieved in 0.76Bi0.5K0.5TiO3&#8208;0.24Ca0.5Sr0.5HfO3 binary system. This system exhibits the highest comprehensive performance among all reported Bi0.5K0.5TiO3&#8208;based ceramics. The large perovskite framework facilitated by the large ionic radius of K+ enhances the local polarity of Bi&#8722;O and Ca&#8722;O, resulting in a large Pm of 57.4&#8197;&#956;C/cm2 under an ultrahigh Eb of 82&#8197;kV/mm. The highly disordered local polar clusters at the nanoscale lead to negligible Pr and high &#951;. This work not only provides a unique design concept to enhance the comprehensive energy storage performance from the perspective of local structure, but also offers insight into the origin of high performance.

         <title>Interfacial Asymmetrically Coordinated Zn&#8722;MOF for High&#8208;Efficiency Electrosynthetic Oxime</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interface coordination strategy has been developed by constructing Zn&#8722;O bridges between ZIF&#8208;7 and graphite felt matrix, which promotes NO electrocatalytic conversion into highly value&#8208;added piperidone oxime due to the faster electron transportation and distorted coordinated mode of Zn sites. It provides an impressive method for designing effective electrocatalysts towards electrosynthetic organic chemicals.







Abstract
Oximes are important intermediates for various chemicals synthesis such as pharmaceuticals, among which one vital precursor for producing neurological disease, antimicrobial and anticancer agents is piperidone oxime (PDO). Compared with conventional thermocatalytic method, it's more attractive to synthesize PDO via green electrocatalytic technology especially utilizing waste nitrogen oxides gas as nitrogen source. However, there are great challenges in catalyst design for high&#8208;efficiency electrosynthetic oxime due to the low electron transport rate and multiple competing reactions. Herein, we propose an interfacial coordination strategy based on metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF) electrocatalyst for the first time to promote oxime electrosynthesis, by building Zn&#8722;O bridges between graphite felt (GF) and zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;7/CGF). Specially, ZIF&#8208;7/CGF delivers a Faraday efficiency (FE) of 75.9&#8201;% with yield up to 73.1&#8201;% for 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;piperidone oxime, which is far superior to the catalyst without Zn&#8722;O bridges (a FE of 10.7&#8201;% and yield of 10.3&#8201;%). In&#8208;depth mechanism study shows that the introducing Zn&#8722;O bridges can promote the electron transfer and induce Zn sites transforming into distorted tetrahedron (Zn&#8208;N3O) coordination mode, which benefits for intermediates adsorption and conversion. The developed strategy presents wide universalities towards various oximes electrosynthesis and adapts to other MOF materials (ZIF&#8208;8, ZIF&#8208;4). This work provides new insights for electrosynthetic organic chemicals and upgrading nitrogen cycle through rational design surficial coordinated electrocatalysts.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Allyl Ketones via BINAP&#8208;CuH&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroacylation</title>

&#945;&#8208;Hydroxy allyl ketones: A highly enantioselective CuH&#8208;catalyzed hydroacylation of benzhydryloxyallene for synthesizing &#945;&#8208;hydroxy allyl ketones is reported. This highly facile and sustainable method also provides access to syn&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted allyl ketones with&#945;&#8208;substituted carboxylic anhydrides through &#8216;matched&#8208;mismatched&#8217; reaction pathway.







Abstract
Catalytic hydrocupration of unsaturated carbon&#8208;carbon bonds to generate organometallic nucleophiles has recently become an attractive alternative to conventional stoichiometric reagents in the stereoselective synthesis. Herein, we have developed an efficient and economical method to synthesize enantiopure &#945;&#8208;hydroxy allyl ketones via a copper hydride (CuH)&#8208;catalyzed hydroacylation of alkoxyallenes, a significant advancement given the scarcity of reports on such scaffolds in the literature. DFT calculations reveal that this reaction proceeds through the nucleophilic attack of a kinetically favourable Z&#8208;selective allyl&#8208;copper intermediate on acid anhydrides via a six&#8208;membered chair&#8208;like transition state, stabilized by strongly attractive non&#8208;covalent interactions that ultimately leads to high level of enantioselectivities using the simple BINAP ligand. This method successfully overcomes the challenges of over&#8208;reduction of carbonyl functionality in the presence of CuH&#8208;complex, olefin isomerization and the presence of a highly enolizable &#945;&#8208;stereocenter, which can lead to erosion in enantioselectivities, making our strategy highly desirable. The reaction exhibits a wide range of substrate scope including symmetrical as well as carbonic anhydrides with both aromatic, and aliphatic substitutions. In addition, &#945;&#8208;substituted acid anhydrides provide exclusive syn&#8208;selective &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted allyl ketones in excellent enantiomeric ratios, where the nucleophilic allylation occurs on one of the carbonyls containing the matched &#945;&#8208;stereocenter, confirmed with mechanistic studies.

         <title>Tandem Catalysis for Plastic Depolymerization: In Situ Hydrogen Generation via Methanol Aqueous Phase Reforming for Sustainable Polyethylene Hydrogenolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem process was developed to convert polyethylene (PE) into n&#8208;alkanes by coupling PE hydrogenolysis with methanol aqueous phase reforming (APR). Utilizing a bimetallic Ru&#8722;Pt/TiO2 catalyst, the process achieved 85.1&#8201;% PE conversion and 81.0&#8201;% selectivity toward liquid fuels and lubricant oils, reducing reliance on fossil fuels through eco&#8208;friendly hydrogen generation.







Abstract
Depolymerizing plastic waste through hydrogen&#8208;based processes, such as hydrogenolysis and hydrocracking, presents a promising solution for converting plastics into liquid fuels. However, conventional hydrogen production methods rely heavily on fossil fuels, exacerbating global warming. This study introduces a novel approach to plastic waste hydrogenolysis that utilizes in situ hydrogen generated via the aqueous phase reforming (APR) of methanol, a biomass&#8208;derived chemical offering a more sustainable alternative. Our results show that a bimetallic Ru&#8722;Pt/TiO2 catalyst achieved high conversion (85.1&#8201;%) and selectivity (81.0&#8201;%) towards liquid fuels and lubricant oils in a tandem process combining polyethylene (PE) hydrogenolysis and methanol APR. By tuning the metal loading, we identified that Pt enhances hydrogen production through methanol APR, while Ru drives C&#8722;C bond cleavage, which is crucial for PE hydrogenolysis. Isotope labeling analysis confirmed that hydrogen generated from methanol APR is effectively utilized in the PE hydrogenolysis reaction. This method was also successfully applied to post&#8208;consumer polyolefin waste, with selectivity toward valuable products ranging from 75.0&#8201;% to 88.9&#8201;%. This study highlights an innovative strategy to reduce reliance on fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;derived hydrogen in plastic waste depolymerization, promoting both sustainability and environmental protection.

         <title>Catalysis&#8208;driven Active Transport Across a Liquid Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe how a small&#8208;molecule catalyst can be transported against its concentration gradient, thanks to the energy provided by the chemical reaction it catalyzes. This non&#8208;equilibrium process builds macroscopic concentration gradients and can be triggered by the localized presence of co&#8208;catalysts. Spatial separation leads to simultaneous autocatalysis and negative feedback, connecting the worlds of molecular ratchets and nonlinear phenomena.







Abstract
Biology has mastered energy transduction, converting energy between various forms, and employing it to drive its vital processes. Central to this is the ability to use chemical energy for the active transport of substances, pumping ions and molecules across hydrophobic lipid membranes between aqueous (sub)cellular compartments. Biology employs information ratchet mechanisms, where kinetic asymmetry in the fuel&#8208;to&#8208;waste (i.&#8197;e., substrate&#8208;to&#8208;product) conversion results in catalysis&#8208;driven active transport. Here, we report an artificial system for catalysis&#8208;driven active transport across a hydrophobic phase, pumping a maleic acid cargo between aqueous compartments. We employ two strategies to differentiate the conditions in either compartment, showing that active transport can be driven either by adding fuel to a single compartment, or by differentiating the rates of activation and/or hydrolysis when fuel is present in both compartments. We characterize the nonequilibrium system through complete kinetic analysis. Finally, we quantify the energy transduction achieved by the catalysis&#8208;driven active transport and establish the emergence of positive and negative feedback mechanisms within the system.

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Nickel Oxide Cluster&#8208;Cluster Heterostructure Enabling Fast Hydrogen Evolution for Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a surface functionalization strategy by decorating transition metal oxide clusters on the commercial carbon black to offer specific catalytic activity and enhanced interaction with metal species. A strongly coupled Pt&#8722;NiOx cluster&#8208;cluster heterostructure simultaneously modulates the coordination environment of Pt and Ni, and delivers fast alkaline hydrogen evolution kinetics. The corresponding AEMWE device with an ultra&#8208;low Pt loading of 50&#8197;&#956;gPt&#8201;cm&#8722;2 exhibits by far the best electrochemical performance (1.90&#8197;V at 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The results highlight the significance of surface functionalization of carbonaceous supports toward the development of advanced electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Carbon black has been extensively employed as the support for noble metal catalysts for electrocatalysis applications. However, the nearly catalytic inertness and weak interaction with metal species of carbon black are two major obstacles that hinder the further improvement of the catalytic performance. Herein, we report a surface functionalization strategy by decorating transition metal oxide clusters on the commercial carbon black to offer specific catalytic activity and enhanced interaction with metal species. In the case of NiOx cluster&#8208;decorated carbon black, a strongly coupled cluster&#8208;cluster heterostructure consisting of Pt clusters and NiOx clusters (Pt&#8722;NiOx/C) is formed and delivers greatly enhanced alkaline hydrogen evolution kinetics. The NiOx clusters can not only accelerate the hydrogen evolution process as the co&#8208;catalyst, but also optimize the adsorption of H intermediates on Pt and stabilize the Pt clusters. Notably, the anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer with Pt&#8722;NiOx/C as the cathode catalyst (with a loading of only 50&#8197;&#956;gPt cm&#8722;2) delivers the most competitive electrochemical performance reported to date, requiring only 1.90&#8197;V to reach a current density of 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The results demonstrate the significance of surface functionalization of carbonaceous supports toward the development of advanced electrocatalysts.

         <title>Valence State Hydrogen Channel Enhances Sustained and Controllable Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution in Diabetic Skin Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By utilizing a novel valence&#8208;state hydrogen channel mechanism, the hydrogen evolution reaction performance of the CoP catalyst under neutral conditions has been significantly improved. Based on this catalyst, a flexible device with controllable hydrogen release has been developed, effectively accelerating the healing of diabetic wounds.







Abstract
Diabetes significantly increases the risk of serious health issues, including prolonged skin inflammation and delayed wound healing, owing to inferior glucose control and suppression of the immune system. Although traditional hydrogen (H2) therapy is slightly effective, its ability to tailor the release of H2 on the skin is limited. Accordingly, this study proposed a novel strategy for electrocatalytic H2 release under neutral conditions to promote wound healing in diabetic mice and rabbit. Herein, a defect&#8208;engineered cobalt phosphide (CoP) catalyst was designed by introducing a neutral single&#8208;metal electrocatalytic Hydrogen valence state channel into CoP. By effectively regulating the formation and transfer of *H active species during the CoP catalytic process, a considerable enhancement in neutral electrocatalytic H2 evolution performance was achieved (&#8722;78.0&#8197;mV@&#8208;10.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Based on this superior catalytic performance, we developed a flexible electrode (namely, CoP/flexible gold electrode made by screen printing (FGSP) by combining a convenient electrolysis platform with continuous electrolyte supply and FGSP, enabling customized H2 release and accelerating wound healing in diabetic mice and rabbits. Notably, the designed flexible electrode features adjustable dimensions, interchangeable substrates, and material adaptability, meeting the diverse needs of clinical and basic research and demonstrating significant potential for applications in clinical medicine.

         <title>Promiscuity Guided Evolution of Decarboxylative Aldolases for Synthesis of Tertiary &#947;&#8208;Hydroxy Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Promiscuity guided evolution of the decarboxylative aldolase, UstD, resulted in an efficient biocatalyst for synthesis of tertiary &#947;&#8208;hydroxy non&#8208;canonical amino acids. Simultaneous collection of variant activity and promiscuity was enabled by competition screening during directed evolution. Changes in promiscuity effectively identified distal residues that influence catalysis, a longstanding challenge in protein engineering.







Abstract
Many applications of enzymes benefit from activity on structurally diverse substrates. Here, we sought to engineer the decarboxylative aldolase UstD to perform a challenging C&#8722;C bond forming reaction with ketone electrophiles. The parent enzyme had only low levels of activity, portending multiple rounds of directed evolution and a possibility that mutations may inadvertently increase the specificity of the enzyme for a single model screening substrate. We show how to intentionally guide UstD towards generality through multi&#8208;generational directed evolution using substrate&#8208;multiplexed screening (SUMS). Mutations outside of the active site that impact catalytic function were immediately revealed by shifts in promiscuity, even when the overall activity was lower. By re&#8208;targeting these distal residues that couple to the active site with saturation mutagenesis, broadly activating mutations were readily identified. When analyzing active site mutants, SUMS identified both specialist enzymes that would have more limited utility as well as generalist enzymes with complementary activity on diverse substrates. These new UstD enzymes catalyze convergent synthesis of non&#8208;canonical amino acids bearing tertiary alcohol side chains. This methodology is easy to implement and enables the rapid and effective evolution of enzymes to catalyze desirable new functions.

         <title>Abstraction of Hydride from Alkanes and Dihydrogen by the Perfluorotrityl Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the isolation of a perfluorotrityl cation (F15Tr+) as a salt with halogenated carborane anions. These salts are stable at ambient temperature in the solid state. As predicted by theoretical calculations, F15Tr+ displays remarkable propensity for abstraction of a hydride. It extracts a hydride rapidly from alkanes and slowly even from dihydrogen.







Abstract
Lewis acids play a central role in a large variety of chemical transformations. The reactivity of the strongest Lewis acids is typically studied in the context of affinity towards hard bases, such as fluoride or oxygenous species. Carbocations can be viewed as soft Lewis acids, possessing significant affinity for softer bases, such as hydride. This work presents the ambient&#8208;temperature isolation of salts of the perfluorotrityl cation ((C6F5)3C+ or F15Tr+) in combination with halogenated carborane anions. The F15Tr+ cation exhibits remarkable hydride affinity, illustrated by the observation of hydride abstraction from dihydrogen, and of the rapid abstraction of hydride from &#8722;CH2&#8722;groups in alkanes. Theoretical studies support the favorability of hydride abstraction from dihydrogen, and indicate that the hydride abstraction from alkanes proceeds via a concerted hydride transfer process that is sensitive to steric effects.

         <title>Targeted Docking of Localized Hydrogen Bond for Efficient and Reversible Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The targeted localized hydrogen bond docking mechanism, activated by polyhydroxy hexitol&#8208;based electrolyte, optimizes solvation structures and reorganizes localized hydrogen bond networks at the interface, thereby decreasing water activity and enhancing Zn2+ deposition kinetics and homogeneity for efficient and reversible zinc&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Hydrogen bond (HB) chemistry, a pivotal feature of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries, modulates electrochemical processes through weak electrostatic interactions among water molecules. However, significant challenges persist, including sluggish desolvation kinetics and inescapable parasitic reactions at the electrolyte&#8208;electrode interface, associated with high water activity and strong Zn2+&#8208;solvent coordination. Herein, a targeted localized HB docking mechanism is activated by the polyhydroxy hexitol&#8208;based electrolyte, optimizing Zn2+ solvation structures via dipole interaction and reconstructing interfacial HB networks through preferential parallel adsorption. By combining in situ spectroscopic characterizations with theoretical calculations, we elucidate the dynamic evolution of localized HB networks, which enhance Zn2+ deposition kinetics and homogeneity, suppress water&#8208;induced side reactions, and mitigate vanadium framework collapse. Our findings support that the targeted HB docking strategy facilitates fast interfacial ion transport kinetics and enables high reversibility, with a substantially prolonged symmetric cell lifespan exceeding 5000&#8197;h. This work markedly advances the efficient and reversible zinc&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>Low Temperature Atomic Layer Deposition of (00l)&#8208;Oriented Elemental Bismuth</title>

         <dc:description>
The first successful growth of elemental bismuth (Bi) thin films via thermal atomic layer deposition (ALD) using Bi(NMe2)3 and Sb(SiMe3)3 at 100&#8201;&#176;C, achieving a GPC of 0.31&#8211;0.34&#8197;&#197;/cycle, is demonstrated. Films transitioned from island to full coverage, with a preferential shift in growth orientation from the (012) to the (003) plane. Metallic Bi was confirmed by XPS and TEM. The 2500&#8208;cycle film exhibited semimetallic behavior with a resistivity of &#8776;200&#8197;&#956;&#937;cm.







Abstract
This study presents the first successful demonstration of growing elemental bismuth (Bi) thin films via thermal atomic layer deposition (ALD) using Bi(NMe2)3 as the precursor and Sb(SiMe3)3 as the co&#8208;reactant. The films were deposited at a relatively low temperature of 100&#8201;&#176;C, with a growth per cycle (GPC) of 0.31&#8211;0.34&#8197;&#197;/cycle. Island formation marked the initial growth stages, with surface coverage reaching around 80&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;cycles and full coverage between 2000 and 2500&#8197;cycles. Morphological analysis revealed that the Bi grains expanded and became more defined as the number of ALD cycles increased. This coalescence is further supported by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, which show a preferential shift in growth orientation from the (012) plane to the (003) plane as the film thickness increases. X&#8208;ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed the presence of metallic Bi with minimal surface oxidation. Temperature&#8208;dependent sheet resistance measurements highlight the semimetallic nature of Bi, with a room temperature resistivity of &#8776;200&#8197;&#956;&#937;cm for the 2500&#8197;cycles Bi. Temperature&#8208;dependent sheet resistance was also associated with a transition in carrier&#8208;type dominance from holes at higher temperatures to electrones at lower temperatures.

         <title>Total Synthesis of the Tridecasaccharide Motif from Angelica Sinensis APS&#8208;1 II Polysaccharide with Anti&#8208;Leukemia Activity and Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tridecasaccharide from A. sinensis APS&#8208;1 II with anti&#8208;leukemia activity has been synthesized for the first time by orthogonal one&#8208;pot glycosylation and stereoselective 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;fucosylation strategies. Structure&#8208;activity relationship studies revealed that not only the 13&#8208;mer but also a 9&#8208;mer showed anti&#8208;leukemia activity.







Abstract
A polysaccharide APS&#8208;1 II from a medicinal plant Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels represents a potential therapeutic agent against leukemia. However, the synthetic accessibility of the highly branched and complex APS&#8208;1 II polysaccharide with multiple 1, 2&#8208;cis&#8208;glycosidic linkages remains a difficult task, impeding the in&#8208;depth structure&#8211;activity relationship biological studies and the development of carbohydrates&#8208;based therapeutics against leukemia. Here, we report the first chemical synthesis of tridecasaccharide repeating unit together with shorter sequences 4&#8208;mer, 6&#8208;mer and 9&#8208;mer from APS&#8208;1 II polysaccharide via one&#8208;pot orthogonal glycosylation strategy based on glycosyl ortho&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)benzoates, which precluded the potential issues such as aglycone transfer associated with one&#8208;pot assembly with thioglycosides. The synthetic pathway also features the following aspects: 1)&#8197;three contiguous and challenging 1, 2&#8208;cis&#8208;Fuc bonds were highly stereoselectively constructed via the newly developed stereoselective 1, 2&#8208;cis&#8208;fucosylation method; 2)&#8197;several 1, 2&#8208;trans&#8208;glycosidic linkages were formed via neighboring group participation effect, while 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;Glc linkage was stereoselectively assembled via N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide reagent modulation; 3) the final [1+1+2+9] one&#8208;pot assembly of the target tridecasaccharide via strategic utilizations of glycosyl N&#8208;phenyltrifluoroacetimidates, ortho&#8208;alkynylbenzoates and ortho&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)benzoates. Biological studies revealed that human leukemia K562 and mouse L1210&#8197;cells could be effectively inhibited by tridecasaccharide repeating unit and substructure nonasaccharide.

&lt;p&gt;A tridecasaccharide from &lt;i&gt;A. sinensis&lt;/i&gt; APS-1 II with anti-leukemia activity has been synthesized for the first time by orthogonal one-pot glycosylation and stereoselective 1,2-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-fucosylation strategies. Structure-activity relationship studies revealed that not only the 13-mer but also a 9-mer showed anti-leukemia activity.

&lt;p&gt;A polysaccharide APS-1 II from a medicinal plant &lt;i&gt;Angelica sinensis&lt;/i&gt; (Oliv.) Diels represents a potential therapeutic agent against leukemia. However, the synthetic accessibility of the highly branched and complex APS-1 II polysaccharide with multiple 1, 2-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-glycosidic linkages remains a difficult task, impeding the in-depth structure&#8211;activity relationship biological studies and the development of carbohydrates-based therapeutics against leukemia. Here, we report the first chemical synthesis of tridecasaccharide repeating unit together with shorter sequences 4-mer, 6-mer and 9-mer from APS-1 II polysaccharide via one-pot orthogonal glycosylation strategy based on glycosyl &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-(1-phenylvinyl)benzoates, which precluded the potential issues such as aglycone transfer associated with one-pot assembly with thioglycosides.

         <title>Tailoring the Surface Curvature of the Supporting Carbon to Tune the d&#8208;Band Center of Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Zinc&#8208;Urea&#8208;Air Batteries</title>

The strain&#8208;induced change in the charge redistribution and binding strength of *O2&#8722;, *OOH and *OH of Fe SA/NhcC contributes to the enhanced catalytic ORR/UOR activity. Due to a lower equilibrium potential for the UOR and the superior catalytic activity of Fe SA/NhcC, the zinc&#8208;urea&#8208;air battery delivers a low charge voltage, high energy efficiency and long lifespan compared to conventional Zn&#8208;air batteries.







Abstract
The catalytic activities of the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are associated with the varying atomic interactions through its characteristic coordination geometry. Yet, modulation of the surface curvature of carbon acting as a supporting body has not been investigated. Herein, we report the superior catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and enhanced performance for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) of single Fe atoms anchored on a highly curved N&#8208;doped carbon dodecahedron with concave morphology (Fe SA/NhcC). Theoretical calculations and in situ spectroscopy disclose that the curvature of the carbon support helps to shorten the bond length of Fe&#8722;N, spatially redistributing the charges around the Fe and thereby lowering the d&#8208;band center toward optimal adsorption for oxygenated species. The Fe SA/NhcC catalyst displays an ultrahigh half&#8208;wave potential of 0.926&#8197;V for ORR and a small potential difference of 0.686&#8197;V for bifunctional ORR/UOR. A rechargeable Zn&#8208;urea&#8208;air battery with the Fe SA/NhcC cathode displays robust discharge durability, excellent cycling lifespan and higher energy efficiency compared to conventional Zn&#8208;air batteries. This work provides new insight into promoting the catalytic activity of SACs through varying the surface curvature of the supporting carbon, tailoring geometric configuration and electronic states of SACs.

         <title>Steady State Free Precession NMR without Fourier Transform: Redefining the Capabilities of 19F NMR as a Discovery Tool</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Steady state free precession (SSFP) &#8211; Complete Reduction to Amplitude Frequency Tables (CRAFT) not only improves sensitivity, resolution and number of signals detected by NMR but can also dramatically reduce experiment times. This powerful approach unlocks the potential of NMR as a discovery tool, enabling unprecedented detection of fluorinated compounds in environmental and biological samples.







Abstract
The 2024 Zurich perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) summit reiterated the urgent need for non&#8208;selective analytical approaches for PFC detection. 19F NMR holds great potential, however, sensitivity limitations lead to long analysis times and/or the possibility of not detecting low concentration species. Steady State Free Precession (SSFP) NMR collects the signal in a steady state regime, allowing 100&#8217;s of acquisitions in the timespan of a single traditional NMR scan. Unfortunately, data truncation from SSFP leads to artifacts and spectral broadening with Fourier transform, hindering interpretation. When non&#8208;Fourier based time&#8208;domain analysis is used, namely, complete reduction to amplitude frequency tables (CRAFT), limitations of SSFP are eliminated while sensitivity gains are retained. This work introduces the combined approach, then applies it for the measurement of PFCs in environmental and biological samples. In all cases, the approach reduces analysis time from many hours to minutes and/or greatly increases the range of compounds detected. For example, when PFOA was spiked into human blood, the detection limit improved ~50&#8208;fold vs standard NMR, while in a standard mixture, the approach detected compounds missed by LC&#8208;MS/MS. The technique can be adapted to any nucleus providing a facile approach to reduce experiment time and improve sensitivity of NMR in general.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Directed Actinide Oxo&#8208;Bond Manipulation in Actinyl Thiacalix[4]arene Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thioether &#8211; expanded calixarene actinyl ions [UO2]2+, [NpO2]2+ and [PuO2]2+ place the two trans&#8208;oxo groups in different environments. One is more accessible, so functionalization and redox reactions are explored to target a cis&#8208;dioxo uranyl ion. Calculations confirm that only one silylation event is needed to initiate oxo rearrangement, and that the putative cis dioxo isomer of [UO2(TC4A)]2&#8722; would be stable if it could be accessed synthetically.







Abstract
Understanding the chemistry of the inert actinide oxo bond in actinyl ions AnO22+ is important for controlling actinide behavior in the environment, during separations, and in nuclear waste (An=U, Np, Pu). The thioether calixarene TC4A (4&#8208;tert&#8208;butyltetrathiacalix[4]arene) binds equatorially to the actinyl cation forming a conical pocket that differentiates the two trans&#8208;oxo groups. The &#8216;ate&#8217; complexes, [A]2[UO2(TC4A)] (A=[Li(DME)2], HNEt3) and [HNEt3]2[AnO2(TC4A)] (An=U, Np, Pu), enable selective oxo chemistry. Silylation of the UVI oxo groups by bis(trimethylsilyl)pyrazine occurs first at only the unencapsulated exo oxo and only one silylation is needed to enable migration of the endo oxo out of the cone, whereupon a second silylation affords the stable UIV cis&#8208;bis(siloxide) [A]2[U(OSiMe3)2(TC4A)]. Calculations confirm that only one silylation event is needed to initiate&#160;oxo rearrangement, and that the putative cis dioxo isomer of [UO2(TC4A)]2&#8722; would be stable if it could be accessed synthetically, at only 23&#8197;kcal.mol&#8722;1 in energy above the classical trans dioxo. Calculations for the transuranic cis[AnO2(TC4A)]2&#8722; (An=Np, Pu) are at higher energies, 30&#8211;35&#8197;kcal.mol&#8722;1, retaining the U complexes as the more obvious target for a cis&#8208;dioxo actinyl ion. The aryloxide (OAr) groups of the macrocycle are essential in stabilizing this as&#8208;yet unseen uranyl geometry as further bonding in the TC4A U&#8208;OAr groups stabilizes the U=O &#8216;yl&#8217; bonds, explaining the stability of the putative cis[UO2(TC4A)]2&#8722; in this ligand framework.

The aryloxide (OAr) groups of the macrocycle are essential in stabilizing this as-yet unseen uranyl geometry as further bonding in the TC4A U-O&lt;sub&gt;Ar&lt;/sub&gt; groups stabilizes the U=O &#8216;yl&#8217; bonds, explaining the stability of the putative &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;[UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(TC4A)]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in this ligand framework.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Overall Water Splitting Dominated by Direct Ligand&#8208;to&#8208;Cluster Photoexcitation in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
MOFs involving photoinduced ligand&#8208;to&#8208;cluster charge transfer (LCCT) were constructed by carbazole dicarboxylic acid and trinuclear metal&#8208;oxo clusters. Direct LCCT&#8208;triggered photocatalytic performance for overall water splitting (OWS) surpassed that achieved through indirect LCCT pathway. Direct LCCT was pivotal in promoting effective charge separation and transfer, maximizing the photon utilization efficiency and ensuring broad&#8208;spectrum OWS.







Abstract
Expanding the spectral response of photocatalysts to facilitate overall water splitting (OWS) represents an effective approach for improving solar spectrum utilization efficiency. However, the majority of single&#8208;phase photocatalysts designed for OWS primarily respond to the ultraviolet region, which accounts for a small proportion of sunlight. Herein, we present a versatile strategy to achieve broad visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive OWS photocatalysis dominated by direct ligand&#8208;to&#8208;cluster charge transfer (LCCT) within metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Three synthesized OWS MOFs, namely Fe2MCbz (M2+ = Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+), exhibited intrinsic OWS capability without the requirement for extra photosensitizer or sacrificial agent or cocatalyst. Among these, Fe2NiCbz was identified as the superior performer, and when dispersed with polyacrylonitrile nanofibers using electrospinning technology, it achieved the highest OWS rates of 170.2 and 85.1&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 for H2 and O2 evolution, surpassing all previously documented MOF&#8208;based photocatalysts. Experimental and theoretical analyses revealed that direct LCCT played a crucial role in enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency, with exceptional performance of Fe2NiCbz attributed to its well&#8208;optimized energy level structures and highly efficient charge transfer mechanism. This work not only sets a benchmark in OWS MOF photocatalysts but also paves the way for maximizing solar spectrum utilization, thereby advancing renewable hydrogen production strategy.

         <title>Sabatier Principle Inspired Bifunctional Alloy Interface for Stable and High&#8208;Depth Discharging Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a Sabatier principle inspired bifunctional transition&#8208;metal (TM) interface to enable homogeneous Zn dissolution during discharging and dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition during charging. The &#8216;just right&#8217; interaction between TM and Zn endows Cu@Zn electrodes with remarkable reversibility and uniform pre&#8208;stripping morphologies in aqueous Zn metal batteries cycling under high depth of discharging.







Abstract
Achieving stable Zn anodes that can effectively couple with Zn&#8208;free cathodes is essential for advancing high&#8208;performance Zn metal batteries. Here, we propose a Sabatier principle inspired bifunctional transition&#8208;metal (TM) interface to enable homogeneous Zn dissolution during discharging and dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition during charging. Among various TM&#8208;coated Zn (TM@Zn) electrodes, Cu@Zn exhibits the highest reversibility and structural stability, attributed to the optimal interaction between Cu and Zn. The heteroatomic interaction&#8208;dependent electrochemical performance parallels the Sabatier principle. Morphological analyses reveal that bare Zn anodes display detrimental etching pits during stripping, which is different from the uniform dissolution for Cu@Zn electrodes. During subsequent plating, the conductive interface serves as a secondary current collector for uniform Zn deposition in Cu@Zn, thus demonstrating a bifunctional nature. Atomic observations disclose the working mechanisms of this interface as a gradual phase transition from Cu to CuZn5 during cycling. The Cu@Zn anodes exhibit an ultralong cycling lifespan of over 8000&#8197;h at a low current of 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and over 250&#8197;h at a high depth of discharge of 80&#8201;%. They also demonstrate practical feasibility by maintaining 88.7&#8201;% capacity retention after 1000&#8197;cycles in Cu@Zn||VO2 full cells. This work provides new insights into the Sabatier chemistry inspired bifunctional layers for Zn metal battery system.

         <title>Inhibiting Interfacial Electron Leakage via An Artificial Rectified Layer for Longevous Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes an artificial rectified layer with hydrophobic, zincophilic and insulating features to inhibit electron leakage and homogenize ion/electron fields at the electrolyte/Zn anode interface, preventing the Zn anode from side reactions but promoting its (002) oriented deposition at high utilization and efficiency.







Abstract
Dendrites and water&#8208;induced side reactions impose greatly challenge on the implementation of aqueous zinc ion batteries. To tackle these problems, an artificial rectified layer (ARL) with hydrophobic, zincophilic and insulating features was in situ synthesized on Zn surface rapidly to prevent the electron leakage from Zn anode to aqueous electrolyte, which is the underlying logic for uneven Zn deposition and parasitic side reactions. The ARL also displays a high Zn2+ transference number of 0.71 and can build fast Zn2+ transport channels to homogenize the interfacial ion flux and electric field according to the calculated work function and multi&#8208;physics phase simulation results. Therefore, the Zn anode with ARL shows preferred plating along with (002) crystal facet and an admirable Coulombic efficiency of 99.86&#8201;% over 3200 cycles. Zn symmetric cells can withstand large current density up to 40&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and operate stably at 44.2&#8201;% depth of discharge for 250&#8197;hours, surpassing most of published reports. The ARL also enables the Zn||MnO2 full batteries to circulate over 2600 cycles with a high&#8208;capacity retention of 80.1&#8201;% and low self&#8208;discharge at 1&#8197;A g&#8722;1. This work provides a different perspective to comprehend and design satisfactory solid electrolyte interphase for Zn metal anodes.

The hollow&#8208;structured [In2S3&#8208;x/In2O3&#8208;x](OH)y S&#8208;Scheme heterojunction, featuring abundant surface hydroxyl groups and S/O dual vacancies, demonstrates exceptional long&#8208;term stability and outstanding H2 evolution performance at low temperature in photothermal&#8208;driven methanol/water reforming







Abstract
To enable highly efficient in situ hydrogen release from methanol/water reforming at lower temperature, the integration of solar&#8208;energy offers a promising approach to activate methanol/water and substantially lower the activation energy of this reaction. Herein, we present a novel dual&#8208;vacancy defective hollow heterostructure derived from Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks, featuring abundant surface hydroxyl groups and S/O vacancies, for photothermal&#8208;promoted methanol solution reforming into hydrogen. The [In2S3&#8208;x/In2O3&#8208;x](OH)y exhibits exceptional photothermal H2 evolution activity, achieving a production rate of 215.2 mmolgcat&#8722;1h&#8722;1, 16&#8208;fold higher than its thermocatalytic activity, with an apparent quantum efficiency of 66.8&#8201;% at 365&#8197;nm and solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency (STH) of 1.1&#8201;% under AM 1.5G simulated solar illumination, and excellent durability over 82&#8197;h, cumulating 2.61&#215;103 mmolgcat&#8722;1. The synergistic effects of dual&#8208;vacancies and the hollow heterostructure significantly enhance the photothermal effect, lowering the activation energy barrier for methanol/water, enabling H2 production at temperatures even as 80&#8201;&#176;C under non&#8208;alkaline conditions. Furthermore, the incorporated surface hydroxyl groups facilitate the generation of active surface hydroxyls from water, further driving activation and cleavage of C&#8722;H bonds in methanol, thereby markedly reducing the apparent reaction activation energy by 12.5&#8201;%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enable highly efficient in situ hydrogen release from methanol/water reforming at lower temperature, the integration of solar-energy offers a promising approach to activate methanol/water and substantially lower the activation energy of this reaction. Herein, we present a novel dual-vacancy defective hollow heterostructure derived from Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks, featuring abundant surface hydroxyl groups and S/O vacancies, for photothermal-promoted methanol solution reforming into hydrogen. The [In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3-x&lt;/sub&gt;/In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3-x&lt;/sub&gt;](OH)&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits exceptional photothermal H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution activity, achieving a production rate of 215.2 mmolg&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 16-fold higher than its thermocatalytic activity, with an apparent quantum efficiency of 66.8&#8201;% at 365&#8197;nm and solar-to-hydrogen efficiency (STH) of 1.1&#8201;% under AM 1.5G simulated solar illumination, and excellent durability over 82&#8197;h, cumulating 2.61&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; mmolg&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The synergistic effects of dual-vacancies and the hollow heterostructure significantly enhance the photothermal effect, lowering the activation energy barrier for methanol/water, enabling H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production at temperatures even as 80&#8201;&#176;C under non-alkaline conditions. Furthermore, the incorporated surface hydroxyl groups facilitate the generation of active surface hydroxyls from water, further driving activation and cleavage of C&#8722;H bonds in methanol, thereby markedly reducing the apparent reaction activation energy by 12.5&#8201;%. This work provides a new strategy for effective H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production from aqueous methanol reforming under mild conditions, holding great promise for energy-demanding industrial applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Monitoring the Fate of Zn in the Cu/ZnO/ZrO2 Catalyst During CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Methanol Synthesis at High Conversions by Operando Spectroscopy</title>

Using an additively manufactured spectroscopic reactor to investigate the structure of a Cu/ZnO/ZrO2 catalyst with operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy during CO2 hydrogenation to methanol at high conversion. Restructuring of ZnO during high conversion and condensation was observed.







Abstract
In the frame of developing a sustainable chemical industry, heterogeneously catalyzed CO2 hydrogenation to methanol has attracted considerable interest. However, the Cu&#8722;Zn based catalyst system employed in this process is very dynamic, especially in the presence of the products methanol and water. Deactivation needs to be prevented, but its origin and mechanism are hardly investigated at high conversion where product condensation is possible. Here, we report on the structural dynamics of a Cu/ZnO/ZrO2 catalyst at 90&#8197;bar and 40&#8201;% CO2 conversion (at equilibrium conditions), investigated in a dedicated metal&#8208;based spectroscopic cell specially fabricated using additive manufacturing. This particular reactor configuration aims to mimic the high CO2 conversion part of the catalyst bed and can induce product condensation, which is monitored by operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. While Cu remained mostly stable throughout the experiment, Zn underwent strong restructuring. The chosen reaction conditions, including the use of CO2 as carbon source and in situ product condensation, were selected to provide insights under industrial conditions. This work is highlighting the importance of spectroscopic investigations at high conversion levels, offering insights into chemical transformations during deactivation, extending the concept of spatially resolved studies, and thus providing guidance for the design of more stable catalysts.

         <title>Reaction of NHOs with Bisphosphanes &#8211; Designing Diradicaloids, Zwitterions and Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By linking N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins with a P&#8208;substituted indenyl heterocycle, it was possible to synthesize a very exciting new heterocyclic substance class that is both zwitterionic and diradical. The diradical character of these heterocycles can be adjusted by rotation within the molecule, which was achieved by rational design. The thermochromism of these heterocycles was studied by experimental and theoretical methods. Furthermore, we have shown that these heterocycles can activate small molecules. The mechanism of such an activation chemistry was studied and shown to be reversible in some case. Finally, we studied the electronic structure using multireference methods.







Abstract
The linkage of an imidazole&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin (NHO), containing a terminal CH2 donor group, with a phosphorus&#8208;centered diradical molecular fragment leads to an open&#8208;shell singlet diphospha&#8208;indenylide system, a new class of P&#8208;heterocycles, which can be interpreted both as a phosphorus&#8208;centered diradicaloid and as a zwitterion with a permanent, overall charge separation between the N&#8208; and P&#8208;heterocyclic ring systems. The rotation of the imidazole ring, which is thermally possible due to a central C&#8722;C bond with a weakened &#960;&#8208;component, changes both the charge separation and diradical character depending on the dihedral angle, as quantum mechanical calculations indicate. By varying the bulkiness of substituents at the imidazole&#8208;based NHO, it was possible to obtain different diphospha&#8208;indenylide species with different rotation angles in the solid state and hence varying diradical character. Imidazolium&#8208;diphospha&#8208;indenylides represent a new class of NHO&#8208;based zwitterions with diradical character. Their synthesis, structure, and activation chemistry are described, as well as the quantum mechanical description of the electronic structure in these unusual heterocycles. In addition, along the synthesis route to diphospha&#8208;indenylide, we also succeeded in isolating a highly reactive monoradical anion, which was also fully characterized.

         <title>Rational Design of Cobalt&#8208;Based Prussian Blue Analogues via 3&#8201;d Transition Metals Incorporation for Superior Na&#8208;Ion Storage</title>

A series of Cobalt&#8208;Based Prussian blue analogues (CoM&#8208;PBAs) as anode materials for SIBs are designed by a universal low&#8208;energy co&#8208;precipitation approach through the rational incorporation of 3d transition metals. Among them, the CoV&#8208;PBA (CV) anode exhibits remarkable sodium&#8208;ion storage performance, which is attributed to the synergistic modulation of its electronic structure through &#960;&#8208;electron regulation induced by vanadium incorporation.







Abstract
Understanding the relationship between structure regulation and electrochemical performance is key to developing efficient and sustainable sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) materials. Herein, seven Cobalt&#8208;M&#8208;based (M=V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) Prussian blue analogues (CoM&#8208;PBAs) are designed as anodes for SIBs via a universal low&#8208;energy co&#8208;precipitation approach with the strategic inclusion of 3d transition metals. Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulation and experimental validation reveal that a moderate p&#8208;band center of cyanide linkages (&#8722;CN&#8722;) is more favorable for Na+ intercalation and diffusion, while the d&#8208;band center of metal cations is linearly related to electrode stability. Among seven CoM&#8208;based PBAs, CoV&#8208;PBAs possess the best sodium&#8208;ion adsorption/diffusion kinetics and overall cycling performance, including high specific capacity (565&#8197;mAh/g at 0.1&#8197;A/g), cycling stability (over 15000 cycles with 97.7&#8201;% capacity retention), and superior rate capability (174.7&#8197;mAh/g at 30&#8197;A/g). In situ/ex situ techniques further demonstrate that the &#960;&#8208;electron regulation by V introduction enhances the reversibility and kinetics of redox reactions. Moreover, the study identified the &#8220;p&#8208;band center&#8221; and &#8220;d&#8208;band center&#8221; may serve as key descriptors for quantifying the capability and stability of other&#8208;type bimetal Co&#8208;based anodes (oxides, phosphides, sulfides, and selenides) with similar theoretical capacity, offering a potentially transformative approach for selecting practical SIB electrode materials.

         <title>Exceptional Battery&#8208;level Safety of High Energy Density Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries through Non&#8208;Flammable and Low&#8208;Exothermic Localize High Concentration Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A localize high concentration electrolyte (code: E&#8208;SE&#8208;F) with non&#8208;flammability and low&#8208;exothermicity was formulated. Thanks to these features, the safety performance of high energy density lithium ion batteries (LIBs) was significantly enhanced. The LHCE also improved the electrochemical performance of LIBs because of its excellent interphasial and interfacial stability.







Abstract
The poor safety performance of high energy density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is drawing increasing public concern. To enhance the safety performance on the battery level, it is indispensable to design safe electrolytes that are both non&#8208;flammable and low exothermic under abusive conditions. By rational design, a safe localize high concentration electrolyte (LHCE) with non&#8208;flammability and extremely low exothermicity is formulated. Compared with conventional LiPF6&#8208;organocabonate electrolytes and previous LHCEs, the heat generated by the reaction between the safe LHCE and fully charged electrodes under abusive conditions is significantly reduced. Because of the non&#8208;flammability and low&#8208;exothermicity of the safe LHCE, high energy density LIB (1800&#8197;mAh Gr||LiNi0.7Mn0.2Co0.1O2, fully charged to 4.3&#8197;V) with the safe LHCE successfully passes the nail penetration test. Because of the excellent interphasial properties of the safe LHCE, the cycle life and the rate capability of high energy density LIBs are significantly improved when the safe LHCE is adopted. This work sheds light on the design principles of electrolytes for achieving battery&#8208;level safety.

         <title>Force&#8208;Trainable Liquid Crystal Elastomer Enabled by Mechanophore&#8208;Induced Radical Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have showed an example for active smart materials that can exchange substances with the surroundings to gain the training &amp; learning capability enabled by covalently integrating a mechanophore tetraarylsuccinonitrile in the main chain of a single&#8208;network liquid crystal elastomer (LCE). After being trained in different &#8220;learning intermediates&#8221;, additional polymer chains grafted to the original liquid crystal networks form through the mechano&#8208;radical induced polymerization. As a result, the LCE can improve the actuation performance and learn new functions that it does not intrinsically have, which is determined by the characteristics of the &#8220;learning intermediates&#8221;.







Abstract
In nature, organisms adapt to environmental changes through training to learn new abilities, offering valuable insights for developing intelligent materials. However, replicating this &#8220;adaptive learning&#8221; in synthetic materials presents a significant challenge. This study introduces a feasible approach to train liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) by integrating a mechanophore tetraarylsuccinonitrile into their main chain, addressing the challenge of enabling synthetic materials to exchange substances with their environment. Inspired by biological training, the LCEs can self&#8208;strengthen and acquire new functionalities through mechanical stress&#8208;induced radical polymerization. The research not only enhances the mechanical performance of LCEs, but also endows them with the ability to learn properties such as flexibility, light responsiveness, and fluorescence. These advancements are crucial for overcoming the limitations of current materials, paving the way for the creation of advanced intelligent soft materials with autonomous self&#8208;improvement, akin to the adaptive skills of living organisms.

         <title>Photochromic Color Tuning of Copper&#8208;Doped Zinc Sulfide Nanocrystals by Control of Local Dopant Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study achieved tunable photochromic colors (gray to brown) in Cu&#8208;doped ZnS nanocrystals by controlling surface Zn and S stoichiometry using thiol and non&#8208;thiol ligands. Experiments and quantum chemical calculations revealed that Cu distribution on Zn&#8208;rich or S&#8208;rich surfaces determines color, with minimal influence from particle size or Cu concentration.







Abstract
Inorganic photochromic materials offer several advantages over organic compounds, including relatively inexpensive and higher thermal stability. However, tuning their color with the same component has remained a significant challenge. In this study, we demonstrate that the photochromic color of Cu&#8208;doped ZnS nanocrystals (NCs), which is initially pale yellow before light irradiation, can be tuned from gray to brown by adjusting the surface stoichiometry of Zn and S, which is controlled through the use of thiol and non&#8208;thiol ligands. Several experiments and quantum chemical calculations using model clusters revealed that the color change is determined by the distribution of Cu, which significantly contributes to the coloration, specifically whether it resides on the Zn&#8208;rich or S&#8208;rich surface. In contrast, particle size and Cu concentration were found to have little effect on the photochromic color. This study expands the diversity of photochromic responses in inorganic NCs and marks an important step toward the development of further advanced photochromic nanomaterials.

A novel photochemical afterglow system was constructed through structural design and coordination, lighting up the weak&#8208;emissive fluorophore in the form of afterglow through chemiexcitation. Ultimately, a system with a highest reported afterglow luminescence QY of 27.5&#8201;% was accomplished and successfully applied in high SBR in vivo bioimaging and highly sensitive in vitro diagnostic of SAA through lateral flow immunoassay.

Abstract
Photochemical afterglow materials are gaining great attention for the property to continuously emit light after the excitation source is removed. However, their limited luminescence quantum yield (QY) and brightness hinder the use in biological applications. In this study, we introduce a novel photochemical afterglow system that combines a newly designed photoenergy cache unit (PCU) with an emitter through coordination covalent bonds. The PCU boasts a dark state to significantly emit photons only through chemiexcitation in the process of photochemical reactions, facilitating direct energy transfer to the emitter and resulting in bright afterglow. The related mechanisms further guided us to achieve the highest reported afterglow luminescence quantum yield of 27.5&#8201;%. The system can be encapsulated and dispersed in aqueous solutions for in vivo bioimaging in living mice under mild and simple conditions (low concentration, low excitation power, short excitation time, short exposure time), and also for in vitro diagnostic through lateral flow immunoassay, enabling the highly sensitive detection of the inflammatory biomarker serum amyloid A (SAA) and demonstrating excellent correlation with clinical test results. This study offers new insights into enhancing luminescence QY and brightness of afterglow, highlighting the potential of such systems for further biomedical applications.

         <title>Chemiluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer for Targeted Photoactivation of Ion Channels in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) system using oligo(p&#8208;phenylenevinylene)&#8208;imidazolium (OPV&#8722;Im) to activate TRPM2 Ca2+ channels by O2&#8901;&#8722; without relying on external light. The OPV&#8722;Im oligomer targets cell membranes, activating TRPM2 channels and causing intracellular calcium overload, leading to mitochondrial damage, autophagy inhibition, and apoptosis of cells and tumor spheroid. This strategy provides a new method for regulating ion channels and oxidative stress in living cells.







Abstract
The regulation of oxidative stress in living cells is essential for maintaining cellular processes and signal transduction. However, developing straightforward strategies to activate oxidative stress&#8208;sensitive membrane channels in situ poses significant challenges. In this study, we present a chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) system based on a conjugated oligomer, oligo(p&#8208;phenylenevinylene)&#8208;imidazolium (OPV&#8722;Im), designed for the activation of transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) calcium channels in situ by superoxide anion (O2&#8901;&#8722;) without requiring external light sources. The OPV&#8722;Im oligomer targeted the cell membrane efficiently, leading to the activation of TRPM2 channels in situ by the CRET process and subsequent intracellular calcium overload. This cascade resulted in mitochondrial damage and inhibition of autophagy, ultimately inducing cell apoptosis. Additionally, this strategy could be applied for the selective killing of tumor cells that overexpress TRPM2 ion channels and for inhibiting the growth of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) tumor spheroids. Our system offers a novel approach for regulating ion channel activity and oxidative stress in living cells compared to optogenetics and photodynamic therapy.

In this study, we present a chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) system based on a conjugated oligomer, oligo(&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-phenylenevinylene)-imidazolium (OPV&#8722;Im), designed for the activation of transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) calcium channels in situ by superoxide anion (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) without requiring external light sources. The OPV&#8722;Im oligomer targeted the cell membrane efficiently, leading to the activation of TRPM2 channels in situ by the CRET process and subsequent intracellular calcium overload. This cascade resulted in mitochondrial damage and inhibition of autophagy, ultimately inducing cell apoptosis. Additionally, this strategy could be applied for the selective killing of tumor cells that overexpress TRPM2 ion channels and for inhibiting the growth of three-dimensional (3D) tumor spheroids. Our system offers a novel approach for regulating ion channel activity and oxidative stress in living cells compared to optogenetics and photodynamic therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanopore&#8208;Based High&#8208;Resolution Detection of Multiple Post&#8208;Translational Modifications in Protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a simple and efficient nanopore sensing strategy based on host&#8208;guest interactions for detecting PTMs. It can identify 13 types of PTMs at specific peptide positions and is further enhanced by incorporating a short peptide into the probe, enabling differentiation of various PTMs, positional isomers, and multiple PTMs on the target peptide.







Abstract
Protein post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) play crucial roles in various cellular processes. Despite their significance, only a few PTMs have been extensively studied at the proteome level, primarily due to the scarcity of reliable, convenient, and low&#8208;cost sensing methods. Here, we present a straightforward and effective strategy for detecting PTMs on short peptides through host&#8208;guest interaction&#8208;assisted nanopore sensing. Our results demonstrate that the identity of 13 types of PTMs in a specific position of a phenylalanine&#8208;containing peptide could be determined via current blockage during translocation of the peptide through &#945;&#8208;hemolysin nanopores in the presence of cucurbit[7]uril. Furthermore, we extend this strategy by incorporating a short peptide into the probe, enabling the discrimination of various PTMs, positional isomers, and even multiple PTMs on the target peptide. With ongoing improvements, our method holds promise for practical applications in sensing PTMs in biologically relevant samples, offering an efficient alternative to traditional mass spectrometry approaches.

         <title>Robust Mechanically Interlocked Network Ionogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust mechanically interlocked network ionogel (IGMIN) with improved toughness, high strength, and impact resistance was developed by incorporating ion liquids with mechanical bonds that can dissipate energy while maintain structural stability. Its stable performance as sewable strain sensors for robot gait monitoring highlights its practical potential, offering a new strategy for toughening ionogels and advancing mechanically interlocked materials.







Abstract
Ionogels have attracted considerable attention as versatile materials due to their unique ionic conductivity and thermal stability. However, relatively weak mechanical performance of many existing ionogels has hindered their broader application. Herein, we develop robust, tough, and impact&#8208;resistant mechanically interlocked network ionogels (IGMINs) by incorporating ion liquids with mechanical bonds that can dissipate energy while maintain structural stability. Profiting from the dynamic yet stable nature of the mechanically interlocked networks, IGMINs exhibit high tensile strength (9.6&#8197;MPa), fracture energy (39&#8197;kJ/m2), and toughness (25.9&#8197;MJ/m3), along with a high elongation rate (473&#8201;%) and excellent impact resistance and shape memory, resulting in overall performance that surpasses most reported ionogels. Furthermore, in the application of strain sensors for monitoring the gait of crawling robots, the toughness and robustness of IGMINs ensure their ability to consistently output stable electrical signals during the stretching and contraction processes, thereby highlighting their practical application potential. Our work provides a new research strategy for toughening ionogels and promotes the development of mechanically interlocked materials.

         <title>Reconfiguring Terminal Species of Bituminous Coal to Steer Hard Carbon toward High&#8208;Capacity and Fast Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The functional species on the edge/plane terminals of bituminous coal are finely reconfigured by nitri&#8208;oxidation treatment to construct hard carbon with expanded carbon interlayer spacing and plentiful ultramicropores/closed pores. A large specific capacity of 356&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 is achieved along with a high Coulombic efficiency of 88.1&#8201;% and excellent rate/cycling performance.







Abstract
Hard carbons derived from coal precursors have shown bright industrial prospect as the low cost anode materials of sodium&#8208;ion batteries. However, it is of extreme necessity yet challenge to regulate carbon microstructure toward superior sodium energy storage. In this study, we propose a powerful chemical reconfiguration tactic to steer hard carbons toward high&#8208;capacity and fast sodium storage. The functional species on the edge/plane terminals of bituminous coal are finely reconfigured by nitri&#8208;oxidation treatment for effectively inhibiting the reordering of carbon layers under high temperature, thereby creating rich ultramicropores/closed pores and expanded interlayer spacing. These structural merits enable the hard carbon to garner an enhanced capacity of 356&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 along with a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 88.1&#8201;% and long lifespan. More impressively, the sodium storage kinetics is substantially sped up with a large capacity of 215&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 retained at a high&#8208;rate of 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This work will afford a fresh methodology for precursor modulation to accelerate the real&#8208;world practice of hard carbons toward advanced sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Towards the Stable Chelation of Radioantimony(V) for Targeted Auger Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
New kid on the (p) block! The most stable complex of radioantimony yet reported under physiological conditions, [117Sb][Sb(TREN&#8208;CAM)]&#8211;, is demonstrated through a combination of radiochemical and structural studies, in vitro challenges, and in vivo SPECT and PET imaging in mice. These results mark an exciting leap towards implementing the elementally matched pair 117/119Sb in targeted Auger theranostics of cancer.







Abstract
Antimony&#8208;119 (119Sb) is one of the most attractive Auger&#8208;electron emitters identified to date, but it remains practically unexplored for targeted radiotherapy because no chelators have been identified to stably bind this metalloid in vivo. In a departure from current studies focused on chelator development for Sb(III), we explore the chelation chemistry of Sb(V) using the tris&#8208;catecholate ligand TREN&#8208;CAM. Through a combination of radiolabeling, spectroscopic, solid&#8208;state, and computational studies, the radiochemistry and structural chemistry of TREN&#8208;CAM with 1XX/natSb(V) were established. The resulting [1XXSb]Sb&#8211;TREN&#8208;CAM complex remained intact for several days in human serum, signifying high stability under biological conditions. Finally, the first in vivo single photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography imaging studies were carried out using 117Sb, the diagnostic analogue of 119Sb. These studies revealed marked differences in the uptake and distribution of activity in mice administered unchelated [117Sb]Sb(OH)6&#8211; versus [117Sb]Sb&#8211;TREN&#8208;CAM, suggesting that 117Sb is largely retained by TREN&#8208;CAM over the time course of the study. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the most physiologically stable complex of no&#8208;carrier&#8208;added 1XXSb yet reported, offering new promise for the clinical implementation of radioantimony in nuclear medicine. Our results also establish the feasibility of 117Sb as an elementally matched partner to 119Sb for theranostic applications.

Description: The capacity and energy density of manganese metal batteries are greatly enhanced by developing the first cathode based on dual storage mechanism in this work.







Abstract
As a promising post lithium&#8208;ion&#8208;battery candidate, manganese metal battery (MMB) is receiving growing research interests because of its high volumetric capacity, low cost, high safety and high energy&#8208;to&#8208;price ratio. However, the low energy density, mainly constrained by scarce choices and unsatisfying capacity of cathodes, strictly bottlenecks the development of MMBs. In this work, a new class of cathodes based on novel dual&#8208;storage mechanism (DSM) are reported. Working principles of DSM are revealed and deeply understood via ex situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Besides, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept DSM&#8208;based Cu1.8S cathode, which shows the highest specific capacity of 220&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 97.1&#8201;% higher energy density than previously reported cathodes in storing Mn2+ ions, is presented. The key determinants on DSM and design strategies for next&#8208;generation cathodes are revealed via theoretical calculations. This work provides a new class of high&#8208;capacity cathode materials for MMBs, which is expected to draw inspirations to further enhance the energy density of MMBs.

         <title>Taming the Ion&#8208;Dipole Interaction via Rational Diluent Selection for Low&#8208;Temperature Li&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new selection principle based on the diluent selection parameter (DSP, the product of interaction energies of diluent&#8208;solvent/diluent&#8208;Li+ and diluent&#8208;anion/diluent&#8208;Li+) is proposed for admirable diluent selection. Diluents with larger DSP are more apt to tame ion&#8208;dipole interaction, improving the Li reversibility and low&#8208;temperature stability. This work provides new guidance to develop novel diluents for long&#8208;cycle Li metal batteries.







Abstract
Developing advanced electrolytes with high Li affinity is crucial for achieving long&#8208;cycling lithium metal batteries (LMBs). However, the strong Li+&#8208;solvent interactions in conventional electrolytes often induce difficult Li+ desolvation especially under low&#8208;temperature conditions, resulting in the formation of fragile electrode interfaces involving solvents, and thus dissatisfactory cycling stability of LMBs. Herein, by introducing various diluents into the lithium hexafluorophosphate in 1, 2&#8208;dimethoxyethane electrolyte, we reveal that Li+ desolvation is influenced by not only the diluent&#8208;solvent interaction but also the diluent&#8208;anion interaction. Based on these findings, a diluent selection parameter (DSP), which is calculated based on the product of interaction energies of diluent&#8208;solvent/diluent&#8208;Li+ and diluent&#8208;anion/diluent&#8208;Li+, is proposed for diluent selection. A diluent with a larger DSP is more favorable for promoting Li+ desolvation and improving the low&#8208;temperature performance of LMBs. With the rationally selected 1, 2&#8208;dichloroethane diluent (DSP=3.95), the Li

         <title>Regulating Interphase Chemistry by Targeted Functionalization of Hard Carbon Anode in Ester&#8208;Based Electrolytes for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

The inherent high reactive oxygen&#8208;functional groups of hard carbon (HC) anode are strategically converted into a stable Si&#8722;O&#8722;Si molecular layer for regulating uncontrollable interfacial redox reaction energy and charge transfer, suppressing the interfacial side reactions, and contributing to the construction of inorganic/organic hybrid solid electrolyte interphase with low interfacial resistance and enhanced cycling durability.







Abstract
Commercial hard carbon (HC) anode suffers from unexpected interphase chemistry rooted in the parasitic reactions between surface oxygen&#8208;functional groups and ester&#8208;based electrolytes. Herein, an innovative strategy is proposed to regulate interphase chemistry by tailoring targeted functional groups on the HC surface, where highly active undesirable oxygen&#8208;functional groups are skillfully converted into a Si&#8722;O&#8722;Si molecular layer favorable for anchoring anions. Then, an inorganic/organic hybrid solid electrolyte interphase with low interfacial charge transfer resistance and enhanced cycling durability is constructed successfully. Consequently, the modified HC anode delivers an excellent rate capability of 206.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a remarkable capacity retention of 92.5&#8201;% after 1000 cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Moreover, the coin&#8208;type full&#8208;cell equipped with Na2Fe[Fe(CN)6] cathode exhibits an exceptional capacity retention ratio of 80.9&#8201;% after 800 cycles at 1C. The present simple and effective interfacial modification strategy offers a promising and alternative avenue for promoting the development and practicability of HC anode in ester&#8208;based electrolytes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>SN2&#8722;Reaction&#8722; Bonding&#8208;Heterointerface Strengthens Buried Adhesion and Orientation for Advanced Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a novel SN2&#8722;reaction&#8722;driven bonding&#8208;heterointerface to strengthen the buried adhesion and orientation of perovskite film by simultaneously functionalizing the underlying substrate and functionalizing [PbX6]4&#8722; octahedral framework. Benefiting from the reinforcement of buried adhesion and target&#8722;point&#8722;oriented crystallization, an all&#8208;air&#8208;processed carbon&#8722;based all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI2Br device achieves an enhanced efficiency of 15.14&#8201;% with improved stability.







Abstract
Traditionally weak buried interaction without customized chemical bonding always goes against the formation of high&#8208;&#8722;quality perovskite film that highly determines the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells. To address this issue, herein, we propose a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction (SN2) driving strategy to idealize the robust buried interface by simultaneously decorating underlying substrate and functionalizing [PbX6]4&#8722; octahedral framework with iodoacetamide and thiol molecules, respectively. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that a strong SN2 reaction between exposed halogen and thiol group in two molecules occurs, which not only benefits the reinforcement of buried adhesion, but also triggers target&#8208;point&#8208;oriented crystallization, synergistically upgrading the upper perovskite film quality and accelerating interfacial charge extraction&#8211;transfer behavior. Benefiting from the suppressed nonradiative recombination, as a result, an all&#8208;air&#8208;processed carbon&#8211;based all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI2Br device achieves an enhanced efficiency of 15.14&#8201;%, more importantly, with significantly prolonged long&#8208;term stability under harsh conditions. This unique reaction&#8211;driven buried interface provides a new path for manipulating perovskite growth and obtaining advanced perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>The Proximal Protonation Source in Cu&#8722;NHx&#8722;C Single Atom Catalysts Selectively Boosts CO2 to Methane Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise functional group modulation of the coordinating N atom (N&#8722;H or N&#8722;CH3) to Cu2+ in a purpose&#8208;designed single atom catalyst with the active center Cu&#8722;N(Hx)&#8722;C embedded in reduced graphene oxide proves the critical protonation role of the proximal N&#8722;H moiety for CO2 hydrogenation, leading to exceptional electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 performance.







Abstract
Regulating the coordination environment of active sites has proved powerful for tapping into their catalytic activity and selectivity in homogeneous catalysis, yet the heterogeneous nature of copper single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) makes it challenging. This work reports a bottom&#8208;up approach to construct a SAC (rGO@Cu&#8722;N(Hx)&#8722;C) by inlaying preformed amine coordinated Cu2+ units into reduced graphene oxide (rGO), permitting molecular level revelation on how the proximal N&#8208;site functional groups (N&#8722;H or N&#8722;CH3) impact on the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). It is demonstrated that the N&#8722;H moiety of rGO@Cu&#8722;NHx&#8722;C can serve as an in situ protonation agent to accelerate the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methane reduction kinetics, delivering a methane current density (163&#8197;mA/cm2) 2.42&#8208;times that with the &#8208;CH3 substituted counterpart rGO@Cu&#8722;N&#8722;C. Operando spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations elucidate that the high methane faradaic efficiency (77.1&#8201;%) achieved here is enabled by opening up the energetically favorable formyl pathway (*OCHO pathway) against the traditional *CO pathway that normally leads to various CO2RR products other than methane. Our strategy sets the stage to precisely modulate single&#8208;atom catalysts for efficient and selective electrochemical CO2 reduction.

         <title>Paired Photoproduction of H2O2 and 3,4&#8208;Dihydroisoquinoline Over Covalent Pyrene&#8208;(Thio)urea Frameworks with Electron Push&#8208;Pull Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel crystalline pyrene&#8208;thiourea/urea covalent organic frameworks (COF&#8722;Py&#8722;S and &#8722;O) with electron push&#8208;pull effect were successfully synthesized and served as efficient paired photosynthesis catalysts of H2O2 and 3,4&#8208;dihydroisoquinoline (DHIQ) products. COF&#8722;Py&#8722;S exhibited higher 2e&#8722; ORR to H2O2 yield rate of ~19&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible light, with higher THIQ&#8208;SDR conversion (~100&#8201;%) and DHIQ selectivity.







Abstract
Pairing photocatalytic 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroisoquinoline semi&#8208;dehydrogenation reaction (THIQ&#8208;SDR) with two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) is a green solar to chemical strategy by simultaneously utilizing the photo&#8208;excited electrons and holes. However, it is still short of high&#8208;efficiency photocatalyst to drive two reactions above. In the present work, crystalline pyrene&#8208;thiourea/urea covalent organic frameworks (COF&#8722;Py&#8722;S and &#8722;O) were synthesized and demonstrated as high&#8208;performance metal&#8208;free photocatalysts. In particular, COF&#8722;Py&#8722;S exhibited higher 2e&#8722; ORR to H2O2 yield rate of ~19&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible light and finally solid H2O2 products (Na2CO3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1.5H2O2) was collected after long&#8208;time irradiation. Under natural sunlight conditions, the H2O2 production rate over COF&#8722;Py&#8722;S further increased to ~51&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, among the best COF photocatalysts. COF&#8722;Py&#8722;S also showed high THIQ&#8208;SDR conversion (~100&#8201;%) with 3,4&#8208;dihydroisoquinoline (DHIQ) selectivity of ~92&#8201;%. Theoretical calculations reveal stronger electron push&#8208;pull effect of COF&#8722;Py&#8722;S than COF&#8722;Py&#8722;O, enhancing its photoinduced charge carries, and a four&#8208;step 2e&#8722; ORR mechanism with thiourea as the active sites has been confirmed as well as the mechanism of THIQ&#8208;SDR to DHIQ, featuring lower energy barriers for O2 adsorption and *HOOH desorption over thiourea units. This work provides a paired photosynthesis strategy of H2O2 and DHIQ over high&#8208;efficiency pyrene&#8208;(thio)urea COF photocatalysts with electron push&#8208;pull effect.

         <title>Assisted Solubilization Strategy in Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD for Thermally and Mechanically Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An assisted solubilization strategy by employing supramolecular polymerization network of deep eutectic solvent has been innovatively developed in spiro&#8208;OMeTAD to dissolve LiTFSI without conventional acetonitrile and 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyridine. The molecular network inhibits Li+ ions migration and strengthens adhesion at perovskite/spiro&#8208;OMeTAD/electrode interface, thus simultaneously improving thermal and mechanical stabilities under severe conditions.







Abstract
The ions migration and de&#8208;doping reactions caused by conventional doping seriously jeopardizes the thermal stability of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) based on spiro&#8208;OMeTAD as hole transport layer (HTL), which poses a significant challenge for subsequent commercialization. To address these issues, a novel assisted solubilization strategy has been firstly developed using deep eutectic solvent (DES) synthesized from N&#8208;(cyanomethyl)acetamide (NCMA) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI). NCMA can form multiple strong interaction modes with LiTFSI through N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bonding and Li&#8722;O/Li&#8722;N coordination, which effectively inhibits Li+ ions migration at high temperature and increases solubility of LiTFSI in chlorobenzene without acetonitrile and 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyridine (tBP), fundamentally solving de&#8208;doping reaction. In addition, the molecular network with abundant functional groups in DES improves fracture energy of perovskite/spiro&#8208;OMeTAD interface and enhances interfacial adhesion via strong chelation with perovskite and Ag electrode. Consequently, benefiting from tBP removement and inhibited ions migration, the optimized PVSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.02&#8201;%, and the unencapsulated device retains over 90&#8201;% of initial PCE at 85&#8201;&#176;C, 40&#8201;% RH for 1200&#8197;h (ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;2 standard). This innovative assisted solubilization strategy represents a critical step toward improving device stability and accelerating the commercialization of PVSCs.

         <title>Topological Supramolecular Complexation of Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra for Tunable Interconnected Hierarchical Microporosity in Amorphous Form</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of topological supramolecular complexation is proposed to generate frustrated packing for the feasible fabrication of hierarchical microporosity with broad tunability in amorphous form. Secondary building units with cuboctahedron and tetrahedron geometry are complexed through hydrogen bonding and coordination interaction while the mis&#8208;match of the two topologies disfavor the dense packing of the structural units, and extrinsic porosity can be obtained.

The precise engineering of microporosity is challenging due to the interference at the sub&#8208;nm scale from unexpected structural flexibility and molecular packing. Herein, the concept of topological supramolecular complexation is proposed for the feasible fabrication of hierarchical microporosity with broad tunability in amorphous form. The 2.5&#8197;nm metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOP) are complexed with quadridentate ligands through hydrogen and coordination bonding while the mismatch between the MOPs&#8217; cuboctahedron and ligands&#8217; tetrahedron topology leads to frustrated packing with extrinsic microporosity. Amorphous supramolecular frameworks can be obtained that integrate the intrinsic microporosity of the MOPs with the extrinsic porosity from the frustrated packing. The topologies, sizes and flexibility of ligands as well as ligand/MOP ratios are systemically varied, and the pore size distribution can be precisely adjusted. The hierarchical structures ranging from molecular packing to the morphologies of meso&#8208;scale assemblies are probed using ultra&#8208;small, small&#8208; and wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, enabling the quantitative evaluation of the micropores interconnectivity for the understanding of gas permeation performance. Gas separation membranes with permselectivity surpassing the Robeson upper bound can be designed. The findings not only give insight into the microscopic mechanism of supramolecular frustrated packing from topological design, but also pave new avenues for the cost&#8208;effective fabrications of microporous frameworks.

         <title>Shifting Lithium Amide Reactivity to the Radical Domain: Regioselective Radical C&#8722;H Functionalization of 3&#8208;Iodooxetane for the Synthesis of 1,5&#8208;Dioxaspiro[2.3]hexanes</title>

Strained spirocyclic 1,5&#8208;dioxaspiro[2.3]hexanes were synthesized via a lithium&#8208;amide induced single&#8208;electron transfer to a series of non&#8208;enolizable ketones generating a frustrated radical pair&#8208;like N&#8208;centered radical and ketyl radical anion. This pair works synergistically to selectively abstract the &#946;&#8208;hydrogen from 3&#8208;iodooxetane, initiating a radical&#8208;radical coupling reaction. In&#8208;depth computational and experimental investigations support the proposed mechanistic pathway.







Abstract
Strained spiro&#8208;heterocycles (SSHs) have gained significant attention within the medicinal chemistry community as promising sp3&#8208;rich bioisosteres for their aromatic and non&#8208;spirocyclic counterparts. We herein report access to an unprecedented spiro&#8208;heterocycle&#8212;1,5&#8208;dioxaspiro[2.3]hexane. Our synthetic approach leverages a lithium&#8208;amide induced single&#8208;electron transfer to benzophenones generating an N&#8208;centered radical and a ketyl radical anion&#8212;reminiscent of a frustrated radical pair. This pair works synergistically to selectively abstract the &#946;&#8208;hydrogen from 3&#8208;iodooxetane, initiating an exergonic radical&#8208;radical coupling reaction. This process enables the formation of the desired bond between the oxetane core and benzophenone derivatives, ultimately yielding the novel 1,5&#8208;dioxaspiro[2.3]hexane core. The stability and synthetic utility of the novel 1,5&#8208;dioxaspiro[2.3]hexane motif are showcased. An in&#8208;depth mechanistic investigation is presented, including cyclic voltammetry studies, as well as computational calculations and experiments to support the mechanism of this new single electron synthetic tactic.

         <title>Amplified Production of a DNA Decoy Catalyzed by Intracellular MicroRNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We achieved the amplified intracellular production of a DNA decoy targeting NF&#8208;&#954;B using a hairpin DNA circuit known as catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA). This system is catalyzed by oncogenic miR&#8208;21 to produce the NF&#8208;&#954;B decoy, thereby inhibiting NF&#8208;&#954;B with high cancer specificity. Our approach holds great potential for efficient cancer therapy and as a personalized drug discovery system based on miRNA expression profiles.







Abstract
DNA decoys inhibit cellular transcription factors and are expected to be among the nucleic acid drugs used to downregulate the transcription process. However, spatially controlling the on/off efficacy of DNA decoys to avoid side effects on normal cells is challenging. To reduce undesired decoy function in normal cells, we adopted catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) to produce a DNA duplex from a hairpin DNA pair in response to a specific microRNA (miRNA). We designed the DNA hairpin pairs to form a DNA decoy that binds to nuclear factor kappa B (NF&#8208;&#954;B), whose overexpression is related to many diseases, including cancer. The transformation of the DNA hairpin pair to the NF&#8208;&#954;B DNA decoy was catalyzed by miR&#8208;21, which is expressed in various types of cancers. Intracellular CHA progression and the inhibitory effect against NF&#8208;&#954;B were observed only in miR&#8208;21 overexpressing cancer cells. The intracellular miR&#8208;21&#8208;catalyzed production of the NF&#8208;&#954;B DNA decoy has the potential to reduce side effects on normal cells, thereby strengthening the therapeutic profile of the CHA&#8208;decoy system. The ability to customize the combination of catalytic miRNA and target transcription factors would allow our technology to serve as a &#8220;personalized drug discovery system&#8221; for a variety of challenging diseases, including cancer.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Multicatalytic Decarbonylation of Aldehydes Driven by Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;for&#8208;one decarbonylation: two metal&#8208;free multicatalytic decarbonylation processes of either secondary or tertiary aliphatic aldehydes are reported for the first time. The mild reaction conditions are compatible with various functionalities and applied to complex molecules. Importantly, these processes are orthogonal and allow the selective decarbonylation of mixtures of aldehydes.







Abstract
A metal&#8208;free dual photo&#8208; and organocatalytic decarbonylation of aliphatic aldehydes is described for the first time. On the one hand, a wide range of tertiary aldehydes are smoothly decarbonylated thanks to the combination of thioxanthone as photocatalyst and diphenyl disulfide as organocatalyst. On the other hand, by simply using 4&#8208;CzIPN as photocatalyst instead of thioxanthone, various secondary aldehydes readily undergo decarbonylation in an orthogonal manner, via the in situ formation of 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines. Both methodologies are compatible with various functional groups and are readily applied to the decarbonylation of complex molecules.

         <title>Structural Isomerism of {Ag14}10+ Nanocluster Encapsulated by Bowl&#8208;like Polyoxometalates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented structural isomerism of {Ag14}10+ nanoclusters is for the first time observed in bowl&#8208;like polyoxometalate&#8208;encapsulated silver nanoclusters, {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;1 and {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;2. Such structural isomerism effect endows two clusters with distinct electronic structures and physicochemical properties.







Abstract
The structural isomerism of atomically precise nanoclusters provides a preeminent theoretical model to investigate the structure&#8722;property relationships. Herein, we synthesized three bowl&#8208;like polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;encapsulated Ag nanoclusters (denoted as {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;1, {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;1&#8201;a, and {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;2) via a facile one&#8208;pot solvothermal approach. Among them, for the first time, an unprecedented isomeric {Ag14}10+ nanoclusters are obtained in polyoxoanions {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;1 and {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;2, which should be probably induced by the different distribution of coordinating O atoms in two isomeric bowl&#8208;like {Sb3W30} ligands. Clusters {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;1 and {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;2 exhibit distinct electronic structures and physicochemical properties due to the different geometric structures of the {Ag14}10+ nanoclusters, but both clusters can effectively catalyze the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution with over 22,000 turnovers (TONs) after 6&#8208;hour photocatalysis.

Herein, we synthesized three bowl-like polyoxometalate (POM)-encapsulated Ag nanoclusters (denoted as &lt;b&gt;{Ag&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;(Sb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}-1&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;{Ag&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;(Sb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}-1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;{Ag&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;(Sb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}-2&lt;/b&gt;) &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; a facile one-pot solvothermal approach. Among them, for the first time, an unprecedented isomeric &lt;b&gt;{Ag&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;10+&lt;/sup&gt; nanoclusters are obtained in polyoxoanions &lt;b&gt;{Ag&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;(Sb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}-1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;{Ag&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;(Sb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}-2&lt;/b&gt;, which should be probably induced by the different distribution of coordinating O atoms in two isomeric bowl-like &lt;b&gt;{Sb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;/b&gt; ligands. Clusters &lt;b&gt;{Ag&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;(Sb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}-1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;{Ag&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;(Sb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}-2&lt;/b&gt; exhibit distinct electronic structures and physicochemical properties due to the different geometric structures of the &lt;b&gt;{Ag&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;10+&lt;/sup&gt; nanoclusters, but both clusters can effectively catalyze the visible-light-driven hydrogen evolution with over 22,000 turnovers (TONs) after 6-hour photocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Design Two&#8208; or Four&#8208;Electron Reaction Pathway Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient and Selective Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;electron reaction pathway covalent organic framework has been synthesized to boost H2O2 yield by replacing bipyridine N with biphenyl C atoms, which lowers the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step in the reduction of O2 to OOH* intermediates in oxygen reduction reaction process and achieves high faraday efficiency and highly selective hydrogen peroxide production.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are often employed in oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) for hydrogen peroxide production due to their tunable structures and compositions. However, COF electrocatalysts require precise structural engineering, such as heteroatoms or metal site doping, to modulate the reaction pathway during the ORR process. In this work, we designed a tetraphenyl&#8208;p&#8208;phenylenediamine based COF electrocatalyst, namely TPDA&#8208;BDA, which exhibited excellent two&#8208;electron (2e) ORR performance with high H2O2 selectivity of 89.7&#8201;% and faraday efficiency (FE) of 86.7&#8201;%, higher than the reported COFs to date for H2O2 electrosynthesis. The theoretical and experimental results showed that the rate&#8208;determining step energy barrier for reduction of O2 to OOH* intermediates was significantly reduced by replacing of bipyridine with biphenyl blocks, changing from 4e to 2e ORR reaction pathway. Also, the donor&#8208;acceptor characteristic and narrower optical band gap of TPDA&#8208;BDA COF enhanced the electronic conductivity and reduction ability, thus elevating the catalytic activity. As a result, the H2O2 selectivity was maintained above 85&#8201;% even after 50&#8197;h stability test. This work reveals the structure&#8208;property relationship of COF electrocatalysts and provides a new strategy for rational design of high performance 2e ORR COF electrocatalysts for efficient and selective hydrogen peroxide production.

         <title>Switching CO2 Electroreduction toward C2+ Products and CH4 by Regulating the Dimerization and Protonation in Platinum/Copper Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed Pt modified Cu catalysts to effectively modulate the competitive coverage of those intermediates. The Pt single atoms and Pt nanoparticles modified Cu catalysts precisely regulated the protonation and dimerization, with C2+ FE reaching 70.4&#8201;% and CH4 FE reaching 57.7&#8201;%, respectively. We believe that our work could inspire new opportunities for designing and developing catalysts for highly selective and efficient reactions.







Abstract
Copper (Cu)&#8208;based catalysts exhibit distinctive performance in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) with complex mechanism and sophisticated types of products. The management of key intermediates *CO and *H is a necessary factor for achieving high product selectivity, but lack of efficient and versatile strategies. Herein, we designed Pt modified Cu catalysts to effectively modulate the competitive coverage of those intermediates. The Pt single&#8208;atoms and Pt nanoparticles modified Cu catalysts (denoted as Cu&#8208;Pt1 and Cu&#8208;PtNPs) precisely regulated the protonation and dimerization, with the faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ products up to 70.4&#8201;% and the FE of CH4 reaching 57.7&#8201;%, respectively. CO stripping experiments reveal that Pt1 sites could enhance the adsorption of *CO, while PtNPs exhibit *CO tolerance for H2O dissociation. In situ spectroscopic results further confirms that high coverage of *CO is achieved on Cu&#8208;Pt1, while *CHO on Cu&#8208;PtNPs might generate by additional water dissociation. As elucidated by theoretical studies, the interfacial sites of Cu&#8208;Pt1 would favor the *CO coverage promoting the evolution of *OCCO for C2+ products while PtNPs supplementarily accelerate H2O dissociation achieving *CHO for CH4. This work provides insights for efficient and targeted CO2 conversion by atomically design of active sites with engineered key intermediates coverage.

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Application of Chiral Spirocyclic Bisindoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral spirocyclic bisindoles have been designed and synthesized by asymmetric spirocyclization of the corresponding linear ketones by either chiral phosphoric acid catalysis or Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric arylation followed by simple Lewis acid catalysis. These enantioenriched spiro&#8208;bisindoles have been demonstrated as useful chiral backbones for effective chiral catalysts that show good performance in both transition&#8208;metal catalysis and organocatalysis.







Abstract
While modifications of the privileged catalyst backbones, such as 1,1&#8217;&#8208;spirobiindane&#8208;7,7&#8217;&#8208;diol (SPINOL), have led to the development of diverse useful chiral catalysts, the incorporation of heteroarenes in such chiral spirocyclic structures has limitedly known. Herein we report the design of a type of chiral spirocyclic bisindole skeletons where the electronically distinct heteroarenes serve as direct anchor for functional sites. Separate approaches for the synthesis of two different families of such skeletons have been developed via chiral phosphoric acid and rhodium catalysis, respectively. Both strategies provided expedient access to the highly enantioenriched spiro&#8208;bisindoles, owing to not only the high nucleophilicity of the indole ring, but also the robust asymmetric control. These new skeletons have been demonstrated as backbones of effective chiral catalysts for both transition metal catalysis and organocatalysis.

         <title>Coordination Self&#8208;Assembly Induced Hot Exciton Fluorescence and Multi&#8208;Source Excitation Long Afterglow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hot exciton fluorescence and long afterglow emission were realized in the complexes by supramolecular self&#8208;assembly strategy. The complexes emitted bright afterglow after excited by 365&#8197;nm, 450&#8197;nm, white LED and even 800&#8197;nm near&#8208;infrared laser under atmospheric conditions.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic complexes with long afterglow luminescence have attracted extensive attention due to potential applications in display, sensing and information security. However, most of the metal&#8208;organic complex long afterglow materials reported so far are limited to the use of UV light as the excitation source, and the ambiguity of the structure&#8208;activity relationship makes the development of metal&#8208;organic complexes extremely limited. Herein, a series of metal&#8208;organic complexes with ultralong emission lifetime is constructed by coordination assembly of Zn(II) with three isomers. These complexes can emit afterglow when excited by UV light, blue LED, cell phone flashlight or even near&#8208;infrared light (800&#8197;nm) under ambient conditions, and the afterglow is also observed at 360&#8197;K. More interestingly, the inactivation pathway of the triplet exciton was altered by the strategy of supramolecular self&#8208;assembly, which leads to these complexes having hot exciton fluorescence (HEF) emission that is not present in the ligand. The relationship between structure and optical properties is investigated in detail by experiments and theoretical calculations. This work provides guidance for studying the modulation of optical properties by coordination interactions.

However, most of the metal-organic complex long afterglow materials reported so far are limited to the use of UV light as the excitation source, and the ambiguity of the structure-activity relationship makes the development of metal-organic complexes extremely limited. Herein, a series of metal-organic complexes with ultralong emission lifetime is constructed by coordination assembly of Zn(II) with three isomers. These complexes can emit afterglow when excited by UV light, blue LED, cell phone flashlight or even near-infrared light (800&#8197;nm) under ambient conditions, and the afterglow is also observed at 360&#8197;K. More interestingly, the inactivation pathway of the triplet exciton was altered by the strategy of supramolecular self-assembly, which leads to these complexes having hot exciton fluorescence (HEF) emission that is not present in the ligand. The relationship between structure and optical properties is investigated in detail by experiments and theoretical calculations. This work provides guidance for studying the modulation of optical properties by coordination interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Porous 3&#8201;d&#8208;4&#8201;f Coordination Clusters for Selective Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to CO</title>

Two new families of high&#8208;nuclearity coordination clusters [M120RE96] (M = Co and Ni, PCC&#8208;216MR) and [Co144Gd156] (PCC&#8208;300CG) with porous structure, high stability in solution were successfully isolated, demonstrating a superior reactivity and selectivity in converting CO2 into CO under visible light.







Abstract
We report herein two families of porous coordination clusters (PCCs) with 216 nuclearity (M120RE96 or PCC&#8208;216MR) and 300 nuclearity (Co144Gd156 or PCC&#8208;300CG). For the first family M could be either nickel or cobalt, and RE = Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, and Gd; while the latter features the highest nuclearity of transition&#8208;rare earth metal clusters. Characterized by their cube&#8208;like, hollow structures, these clusters exhibit the ability to absorb N2 and CO2. Besides, these clusters can be dissolved in both aqueous and acetonitrile/methanol solutions, and capable of acting as homogeneous catalysts for converting CO2 to CO under visible light. The gadolinium analogues of these clusters all show turnover numbers over 10000 and turnover frequencies over 1&#8197;s&#8722;1. In particular, the nickel based bimetallic cluster (PCC&#8208;216NG) demonstrates nearly 100&#8201;% selectivity for the reduction product, which may open a new direction for the design and development of PCCs based catalysts.

         <title>A ZnO&#8208;based Catalytic System for the Synthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide from Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic system (ZnO(OVs)/Zn plate) has an internal electron source for the synthesis of H2O2 from water and oxygen in ambient air. Water forms a liquid film on the hydrophilic ZnO surface, accelerating the oxygen transfer from the ambient air to the catalyst surface and facilitating the separation and collection of the reaction product.







Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has a wide range of applications as an eco&#8208;friendly and sustainable oxidant. However, the clean, efficient and convenient synthesis of this compound remains challenging. This work demonstrates a rationally designed electron&#8208;self&#8208;supplied catalytic system capable of generating H2O2 from water and atmospheric oxygen without extra energy input. This catalytic system is made of a ZnO coating containing oxygen vacancies and a Zn substrate. The ZnO catalyst layer obtains electrons from the Zn substrate to synthesize H2O2. The H2O2 concentration produced by this catalytic system is up to 17.9&#8197;mM without any secondary processing. This remarkably high concentration is attributed to the formation of a liquid film on the hydrophilic ZnO surface that promotes the oxygen reduction reaction by accelerating the transfer of oxygen from the ambient air to the catalyst surface. By integrating with atmospheric fog collection, this system can continuously collect H2O2 directly from the air.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Aqueous Electrolyte Induced Formation of Water&#8208;Poor Zn2+ Solvation Structures and Gradient Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase for Long&#8208;Life Zn&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new high&#8208;entropy aqueous electrolyte is developed by introducing multiple solutes and solvents. The well&#8208;designed high&#8208;entropy electrolyte reduces the content of solvated water molecules and free water while forming a robust gradient solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase protective layer and a cationic electrostatic shielding layer on the Zn anode, which can effectively mitigate the corrosion of the Zn anode and promote uniform deposition of Zn.







Abstract
Electrolyte engineering has emerged as an effective strategy for stabilizing Zn&#8208;metal anodes. However, a single solute or solvent additive is far from sufficient to meet the requirements for electrolyte cycling stability. Here, we report a new&#8208;type high&#8208;entropy electrolyte composed of equal molar amounts of Zn(OTf)2 and LiOTf, along with equal volumes of H2O, triethyl phosphate, and dimethyl sulfoxide, which enhances electrolyte stability by increasing solvation entropy. Specifically, this well&#8208;designed high&#8208;entropy electrolyte reduces the content of solvated and free water molecules while forming a robust gradient solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase on the Zn anode surface, protecting the Zn anode from water&#8208;induced corrosion. Moreover, the cationic electrostatic shielding layer on the Zn anode effectively suppresses the &#8220;tip effect&#8221;, enabling the uniform deposition of Zn. The synergistic effects of this mixed electrolyte effectively leverage the properties of individual additives, significantly extending the cycle life of Zn&#8208;metal anodes. Consequently, the resulting Zn//Zn symmetric cell using this high&#8208;entropy electrolyte can operate over 8000&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 0.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. To highlight, in a Zn//V2O5&#8901;H2O pouch cell, it retains 83.1&#8201;% of initial capacity after 420 cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Such multifunctional high&#8208;entropy electrolyte design provides a meaningful reference for stable Zn&#8208;metal anodes.

         <title>Where Does the Proton Go? Structure and Dynamics of Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Switching in Aminophosphine Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aminophosphine chalcogenides are relevant in many organocatalytic concepts and are the focus of prebiotic studies. Spectroscopy (IR, 1H DOSY, 15N NMR), MD simulations, and DFT calculations provide unique insight into their proton&#8208;binding affinity. All conceivable hydrogen&#8208;bonding modes can be formed and controlled. Fundamental principles of self&#8208;organization, proton&#8208;hopping, and of the behavior at the lower concentration threshold are revealed.







Abstract
Aminophosphates are the focus of research on prebiotic phosphorylation chemistry. Their bifunctional nature also makes them a powerful class of organocatalysts. However, the structural chemistry and dynamics of proton&#8208;binding in phosphorylation and organocatalytic mechanisms are still not fully understood. Aminophosphine chalcogenides, preserving the central H2N&#8722;P+&#8722;Ch&#8722; structural motif, represent well&#8208;suited molecular models that mimic proton&#8208;binding, hydrogen&#8208;bond switching and supramolecular self&#8208;assembling behavior of catalytically and prebiotically relevant molecules. Through spectroscopic (IR, 1H DOSY, 15N NMR), molecular dynamics, and computational investigations, the dynamic proton switching capability of aminophosphate analogs was demonstrated. It was shown under which conditions the amino (NH2) or chalcogen (Ch) functions in H2N&#8722;P+&#8722;Ch&#8722; structural units are protonated. In fact, all conceivable modes of hydrogen&#8208;bonding were identified, revealing substantial differences between the oxygen derivative and the heavier congeners. Using coordinating anions, supramolecular zigzag&#8208; and cube&#8208;shaped arrangements were found in the solid&#8208;state and in solution. After break&#8208;up of the cube structure, the sulfides and selenides no longer form stable interactions with HCl molecules. In the absence of coordinating anions, however, protonation of the chalcogen function is preferred. In contrast to the oxygen derivative, the heavier protonated congeners show dynamic intramolecular proton&#8208;hopping between the chalcogen and the amino function.

It was shown under which conditions the amino (NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) or chalcogen (Ch) functions in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&#8722;P&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;Ch&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; structural units are protonated. In fact, all conceivable modes of hydrogen-bonding were identified, revealing substantial differences between the oxygen derivative and the heavier congeners. Using coordinating anions, supramolecular zigzag- and cube-shaped arrangements were found in the solid-state and in solution. After break-up of the cube structure, the sulfides and selenides no longer form stable interactions with HCl molecules. In the absence of coordinating anions, however, protonation of the chalcogen function is preferred. In contrast to the oxygen derivative, the heavier protonated congeners show dynamic intramolecular proton-hopping between the chalcogen and the amino function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Crystalline, Porous Figure&#8208;Eight&#8208;Noded Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>

Topology&#8208;directed condensation of Figure&#8208;eight units develops novel double&#8208;decker 2D covalent organic frameworks to create well&#8208;defined &#960; arrays and 1D micropores. The figure&#8208;eight frameworks are brilliant light emitters, convert &#960; columns into water oxidation and oxygen reduction centers, and produce H2O2 efficiently with water/salt water, oxygen/air, and light as sole inputs, opening a novel way to framework and well&#8208;defined figure&#8208;eight materials.







Abstract
Figure&#8208;eight macrocycles represent a fascinating class of &#960;&#8208;conjugated units characterized by unique aesthetics and non&#8208;contact molecular crossing at the center. Despite progress in synthesis over the past century, research into inorganic, organic, and polymeric figure&#8208;eight materials remains in its infancy. Here we report the first examples of figure&#8208;eight covalent organic frameworks by condensing figure&#8208;eight knots to create extended porous figure&#8208;eight &#960; architectures. A distinct feature is that polymerization interweaves figure&#8208;eight knots into double&#8208;decker layers, which upon supramolecular polymerization organize well&#8208;defined layer frameworks. The figure&#8208;eight frameworks exhibit a band gap of 2.3&#8197;eV and emit bright orange florescence with benchmark quantum yields. Remarkably, the donor&#8208;acceptor figure&#8208;eight skeletons convert the figure&#8208;eight knots into reduction centers and the linkers into oxidation sites upon light irradiation, enable charge transport and accumulation through &#960; columns, while the built&#8208;in hydrophilic micropores allow rapid water and oxygen delivery via capillary effect. With these distinct features, the figure&#8208;eight frameworks function as a photocatalyst to produce hydrogen peroxide at high rate and efficiency with water/saltwater, oxygen/air, and light as sole inputs. This work paves a way to a new class of molecular frameworks, underpinning the study of well&#8208;defined figure&#8208;eight materials to explore unprecedented structures and functions so far we untouched.

         <title>Unlocking Hexafluoroisopropanol as a Practical Anion&#8208;Binding Catalyst for Living Cationic Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This contribution unlocks a simple, versatile, robust, and sustainable anion&#8208;binding catalytic strategy for living cationic polymerization, wherein commercially accessible hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), when used in high loading, can create higher&#8208;order HFIP aggregates to mediate dormant&#8208;active species equilibrium via non&#8208;covalent anion&#8208;binding principle, thereby delivering unprecedented polymerization activity and controllability across various electron&#8208;rich vinyl monomers under mild conditions.







Abstract
Living cationic polymerization (LCP) is a classical technique for precision polymer synthesis; however, due to the high sensitivity of cationic active species towards chain&#8208;transfer/termination events, it is notoriously difficult to control polymerization under mild conditions, which inhibits its progress in advanced materials engineering. Here, we unlock a practical anion&#8208;binding catalytic strategy to address the historical dilemma in LCP. Our experimental and mechanistic studies demonstrate that commercially accessible hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), when used in high loading, can create higher&#8208;order HFIP aggregates to tame dormant&#8208;active species equilibrium via non&#8208;covalent anion&#8208;binding principle, in turn inducing distinctive polymerization kinetics behaviors that grant efficient chain propagation while minimizing competitive side reactions. This unique control mechanism delivers unprecedented polymerization activity and controllability across various electron&#8208;rich vinyl monomers under mild conditions, and provides easy access to high molecular weight polymers, block copolymers, and end&#8208;functionalized telechelic polymers. Also, the minimalistic structure of HFIP coupled with its convenient removal and recycle renders this approach easy to scale up, without concern for cost, sustainability and complicated work&#8208;up processes associated with previous systems. This study presents another universal and sustainable strategy for cationic macromolecular engineering, and will also stimulate further exploration of innovative non&#8208;covalent catalysis that enables more challenging living polymerization systems.

         <title>Tuning the Acid Hardness Nature of Cu Catalyst for Selective Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by hard&#8208;soft acid&#8208;base theory, this work explores tuning the hardness properties of Cu&#8208;based catalysts to enhance nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion. By modifying Cu&#8208;based catalyst with BaO, we enhanced improved dynamics for protonation and desorption of key intermediates, achieving 97.3&#8201;% Faradaic Efficiency and stability over wide potential and nitrate range, providing a new paradigm for electrocatalyst design.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) in alkaline electrolyte presents a sustainable pathway for energy storage and green ammonia (NH3) synthesis. However, it remains challenging to obtain high activity and selectivity due to the limited protonation and/or desorption processes of key intermediates. Herein, we propose a strategy to regulate the acid hardness nature of Cu catalyst by introducing appropriate modifier. Using density functional theory calculations, we firstly identified that the BaO&#8208;modified Cu showed optimal Gibbs free energies for key NO3RR steps, including the protonation of *NO and the desorption of *NH3. Experimentally, the BaO&#8208;modified Cu catalyst exhibited 97.3&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency (FE) for NH3 with a yield rate of 356.9&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1. It could also maintain high activity across a wide range of applied potentials and nitrate substrate concentrations. Detailed experimental and theoretical studies revealed that the Ba species could modulate the local electronic states of Cu, enhance the electron transfer rate, and optimize the adsorption/protonation/desorption processes of the N&#8208;containing intermediates, leading to the excellent catalytic performance for NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3.

         <title>All&#8208;in&#8208;One Photoacid Generators with Green/Red&#8208;light Responsiveness and Cooperative Functionality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
PBI&#8208;PAG undergoes a quantitative (&gt;99&#8201;%) photoreaction to generate acid and photosensitizer (CBI) upon green/red light (560&#8197;nm&#8208;605&#8197;nm) excitation. Beyond respective roles as catalyst and PDT agent, the released acid and CBI sensitizer could cooperate in tumor anti&#8208;metastasis and ablation, granting PBI&#8208;PAG as a powerful molecular tool in inter&#8208;disciplinary applications.







Abstract
Photoacid generators (PAGs) are invaluable molecular tools that exhibited tremendous potential in emerging interdisciplinary researches of life&#8208;science, nanotechnology and smart materials. However, current PAGs are primarily mono&#8208;functional in terms of acid generation and rely on UV/deep&#8208;blue light excitation, posing a fundamental hurdle to their broader adoption. Developing cooperatively functioned PAGs with long&#8208;wavelength light responsiveness presents a formidable challenge due to the absence of suitable molecular scaffolds. Here, we introduce a newly&#8208;developed perylene bisimides PAG motif (PBI&#8208;PAG) that integrates desired multi&#8208;functionality and visible&#8208;light photo&#8208;reactivity. Taking advantages of characteristic opto&#8208;electronic properties of PBI scaffold, PBI&#8208;PAGs are capable of quantitative releasing (&gt;99&#8201;%) a palette of acids upon green/red light (560&#8211;605&#8197;nm) excitation. Concurrently, a photo&#8208;generated counterpart is functioned as a photo&#8208;sensitizer that could perform cooperatively with acid as an anti&#8208;metastasis cancer therapy agent. These two processes constitute the first example of a cooperatively functioned PAG operated at substrate&#8208;adaptive wavelengths.

Taking advantages of characteristic opto-electronic properties of &lt;b&gt;PBI&lt;/b&gt; scaffold, &lt;b&gt;PBI-PAG&lt;/b&gt;s are capable of quantitative releasing (&amp;gt;99&#8201;%) a palette of acids upon green/red light (560&#8211;605&#8197;nm) excitation. Concurrently, a photo-generated counterpart is functioned as a photo-sensitizer that could perform cooperatively with acid as an anti-metastasis cancer therapy agent. These two processes constitute the first example of a cooperatively functioned &lt;b&gt;PAG&lt;/b&gt; operated at substrate-adaptive wavelengths.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Gradient Design with Low&#8208;Tortuosity Overcoming Kinetic Limitations in High&#8208;Loading Solid&#8208;State Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multilayer coating with magnetic field alignment is designed to optimize ion transport and concentration gradients in solid&#8208;state cathodes, enhancing electrochemical kinetics and increasing energy/power densities, thereby overcoming a key challenge in solid&#8208;state battery commercialization.







Abstract
The extensive commercialization of practical solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) necessitates the development of high&#8208;loading solid&#8208;state cathodes with fast charging capability. However, electrochemical kinetics are severely delayed in thick cathodes due to tortuous ion transport pathways and slow solid&#8208;solid ion diffusion, which limit the achievable capacity of SSBs at high current densities. In this work, we propose a conductivity gradient cathode with low&#8208;tortuosity to enable facile ion transport and counterbalance ion concentration gradient, thereby overcoming the kinetic limitations and achieving fast charging capabilities in thick cathodes. The LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathodes deliver a room&#8208;temperature (RT) capacities of 147 and 110&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;C and 10&#8197;C, respectively, and meanwhile achieve a RT areal capacity of 3.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 3&#8197;C, enabling SSBs simultaneously high energy and power densities. The universality of this strategy is demonstrated in LiFePO4 cathodes, providing a novel solution for fast charging and large&#8208;scale application of high&#8208;loading SSBs.

         <title>Insights into the Electrolyte Hydrolysis and Its Impacts on the Interfacial Chemistry of a Li+&#8208;Intercalated Anode during High&#8208;Temperature Calendar Aging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ liquid time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry was employed for decoupling the hydrolysis reaction mechanism of two conventional Li salts in the bulk of electrolyte and at the Li+&#8208;intercalated anode surface during high&#8208;temperature storage. Results showed that the hydrolysis products effectively passivated the anode surface and contributed to improved interfacial stability against high&#8208;temperature calendar aging.







Abstract
Calendar aging occurring during high&#8208;temperature storage has long plagued practical realization of long&#8208;life, high&#8208;safety lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Generally, the aging process is ascribed to the hydrolysis reaction of fluorine&#8208;containing electrolyte salt that generates hydrofluoric acid and chemically corrodes the anode surface. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism about electrolyte degradation, HF generation and surface corrosion remains concealed for various electrolytes. In this work, we employed in situ liquid time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy to resolve the chemical evolution during high&#8208;temperature calendar aging in the bulk of the electrolyte and at the anode/electrolyte interface. Two conventional salts, LiPF6 and Li bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI), were employed for comparison. We identify that the high&#8208;temperature hydrolysis of LiPF6 preferentially occurs when the anion aggregates ([PF6+LiPF6]&#8722;) are attacked by trace H2O. HPO2F2, HF and LiF are generated and assist formation of an inorganics&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), improving anode stability against parasitic reactions. The LiFSI&#8208;based electrolyte does not involve hydrolysis, which facilities the formation of an organics&#8208;rich SEI. Nevertheless, the SEI does not passivate the anode surface and could induce severe corrosions via electron tunneling at a high temperature. Our work offers original insights into rational design of electrolyte and interface for high&#8208;energy, long&#8208;calendar&#8208;life LIBs.

         <title>Lewis and Br&#248;nsted Acids Synergy in Photocatalytic Aerobic Alcohol Oxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acid sites were integrated into TiO2, which can supply coordinatively unsaturated sites to adsorb molecular oxygen and establish hydrogen bond with the OH groups of alcohols. The synergy of Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acid sites achieves efficient photocatalytic organic transformations.







Abstract
Photocatalytic chemical transformations for green organic synthesis has attracted much interest. However, their development is greatly hampered by the lack of sufficient reactive sites on the photocatalyst surface for the adsorption and activation of substrate molecules. Herein, we demonstrate that the introduction of well&#8208;defined Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acid sites coexisting on the surface of TiO2 (SO42&#8722;/N&#8208;TiO2) creates abundant active adsorption sites for photoredox reactions. The electron&#8208;deficient Lewis acid sites supply coordinatively unsaturated surface sites to adsorb molecular oxygen, and the Br&#248;nsted acid sites are liable to donate protons to form hydrogen bonds with the OH groups of alcohols like benzyl alcohol (BA). These coexistent acid sites result in a strong synergistic effect in photocatalytic aerobic oxidation of BA. For example, the conversion of BA to benzaldehyde was found to be 88.6&#8201;%, being much higher than those of pristine TiO2 (14.7&#8201;%), N&#8208;doped TiO2 (N&#8208;TiO2, 24.6&#8201;%), sulfated TiO2 (SO42&#8722;/ TiO2, 35.4&#8201;%), and even their sum. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was determined to be 58.1&#8201;% at 365&#8197;nm and 12.9&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm over SO42&#8722;/N&#8208;TiO2. This strategy to create effective synergistic Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acids on the catalyst surfaces enables us to apply it to other semiconducting photocatalytic organic transformations.

         <title>Clone&#8208;Resolved Chemical Depletion of T cells via Cellular Proximity Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical strategy of depleting T cells utilizes chemically engineered dendritic cell (DC) &#8208;derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) to destroy targeted T cell clones in close proximity. This strategy enables selective elimination of pathogenic T cell clones without impairing normal T cells, which might serve as a new antigen&#8208;specific approach for blunting autoimmune inflammations.







Abstract
T cells play a pivotal role in the development of autoimmune diseases. To mitigate autoimmune inflammation without inducing global immunosuppression, it is crucial to selectively eliminate autoreactive T cell clones while preserving the normal T cell repertoire. In this study, we applied cellular proximity chemistry to develop a T&#8208;cell depletion method with clonal precision. Using engineered dendritic cells (DCs) with surface&#8208;bound photosensitizers, we generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) at immune synapses, leading to the targeted death of antigen&#8208;specific T cells in close proximity. This process induces lipid oxidation in T cell membranes, triggering ferroptosis&#8208;like cell death. The method enables the selective elimination of specific T cell clones without affecting others, in which the clonal resolution was demonstrated by TCR sequencing. Finally, we demonstrated the efficacy of this approach in a type 1 diabetes model by selectively depleting the pathogenic 8.3 T cell clone, thereby protecting islet &#946; cells and preserving overall T cell function. This strategy offers a promising avenue for immunosuppressive therapy that targets pathogenic T cells while maintaining overall immune integrity.

         <title>Forward&#8208; and Retro&#8208;Vapofluorochromism of Sponge&#8208;Like Macrocycle Crystals</title>

         <dc:description>
Organic solid&#8208;state luminescent materials with a wide range of multicolor properties have attracted increasing attention due to their wide applications. We here report a unique forward&#8208; and retro&#8208;vapofluorochromic behavior of sponge&#8208;like macrocycle crystals for multicolor switching through reversible amine vapor uptake and &#8220;squeeze&#8221; &#8211; induced solid&#8208;state intramolecular and intermolecular motion.







Abstract
Achieving dynamic multicolor emission through solid&#8208;state molecular motion is of significant importance for advancing applications in organic solid&#8208;state luminescent materials. Herein, we report macrocycle crystals with unique forward&#8208; and retro&#8208;vapofluorochromic behavior, which is realized by reversible amine vapor uptake and amine&#8208;&#8220;squeeze&#8221; induced guest release. The forward&#8208;vapofluorochromism occurs when aliphatic amines penetrate guest&#8208;free macrocycle crystals to form host&#8208;guest complex crystals. These fluorescent properties can be reversibly toggled by exposing the amine&#8208;loaded crystals to another amine vapor through competitive guest replacement inside the crystals. Notably, retro&#8208;vapofluorochromism is achieved by exposing amine&#8208;loaded crystals to &#945;&#8208;methylbenzylamine (MBA). Mechanistic studies show that MBA molecules do not penetrate the crystals, but rather &#8220;squeeze&#8221; the crystals to release loaded amines, driving the amine&#8208;loaded crystals back to the guest&#8208;free phase. The demonstrated forward&#8208; and retro&#8208;vapofluorochromism has already been successfully integrated into a highly secure five&#8208;layer information encryption system.

         <title>Cyano&#8208;Modified Multi&#8208;Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Emitters Towards Pure&#8208;Green OLEDs with a CIEy Value of 0.74</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;narrow green multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters have been developed by synergistic cyano&#8208;decoration and a &#960;&#8208;extension strategy. The resulting organic light&#8208;emitting diodes deliver an exceptional green color purity that approaches the BT.2020 standard, as well as high external quantum efficiencies exceeding 30&#8201;%.







Abstract
The development of pure&#8208;green organic emitters with ideal emission peaks and ultra&#8208;narrow full&#8208;widths at half&#8208;maximum (FWHMs) remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report two new green emitters, CNBN and MCNBN, which achieve extremely narrow FWHMs by synergistic rigid &#960;&#8208;extension and cyano&#8208;substitution of a sky&#8208;blue multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) core. The introduction of cyano groups induces red&#8208;shifts in the emission to the green region and dramatically minimizes the FWHMs. In toluene solution, CNBN and MCNBN exhibit narrowband emission with a maximum at 501&#8197;nm and 510&#8197;nm with ultra&#8208;narrow FWHMs of 14&#8197;nm/0.066&#8197;eV and 15&#8197;nm/0.071&#8197;eV, respectively. Given the near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yields and almost 100&#8201;% horizontal dipole orientation, the electroluminescent (EL) devices based on CNBN and MCNBN deliver external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) exceeding 30&#8201;% with FWHMs of 16&#8197;nm/0.072&#8197;eV and 17&#8197;nm/0.080&#8197;eV, respectively. Notably, the MCNBN&#8208;based device achieves pure&#8208;green emission with a maximum at 517&#8197;nm with Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage coordinates of (0.17, 0.74), closely aligning with the BT.2020 green standard.

         <title>Integrated Two&#8208;in&#8208;one Strategy for Efficient Neutral Hydrogen Peroxide Electrosynthesis via Phosphorous Doping in 2D Mesoporous Carbon Carriers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a two&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy for efficient electrocatalytic H2O2 production in neutral media by incorporation P dopant in the carbon framework. The incorporation of P not only helps to modify the microenvironment of the catalyst, but also further adjusts the coordination environment and electronic structure of the In single atom. This optimization enhances the adsorption of *OOH, thereby accelerating the efficient formation of H2O2.







Abstract
Herein, we demonstrate a two&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy for efficient neutral electrosynthesis of H2O2 via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR), achieved by synergistically fine&#8208;modulating both the local microenvironment and electronic structure of indium (In) single atom (SA) sites. Through a series of finite elemental simulations and experimental analysis, we highlight the significant impact of phosphorous (P) doping on an optimized 2D mesoporous carbon carrier, which fosters a favorable microenvironment by improving the mass transfer and O2 enrichment, subsequently leading to an increased local pH levels. Consequently, an outstanding 2e&#8722; ORR performance is observed in neutral electrolytes, achieving over 95&#8201;% selectivity for H2O2 across a broad voltage range of 0.1 to 0.5&#8197;V vs RHE. In a flow cell, the production rate of H2O2 exceeds 22.54&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 while maintaining high stability at industrial&#8208;level current densities. These results are comparable to, if not better than, those achieved under alkaline conditions. Further analysis, both experimental and theoretical, indicates that the P dopant occupies the second coordination sphere of the In SA, which shows optimized OOH* binding strength for an enhanced 2e&#8722; ORR kinetic.

         <title>Flow Electroreductive Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclopropanation of Alkenes Using gem&#8208;Dichloroalkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an efficient continuous&#8208;flow electroreductive nickel&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation of olefins using commercial gem&#8208;dichloroalkanes. The reaction is tolerant to oxygen and moisture while displaying a broad functional group compatibility. This methodology enables gram&#8208;scale cyclopropanation and is compatible with a wide range of alkenes. Mechanistic studies suggests that a nickel carbene is electro&#8208;generated to afford the cyclopropane ring.







Abstract
Cyclopropanes are valuable motifs in organic synthesis, widely featured in pharmaceuticals and functional materials. Herein, we report an efficient electrochemical methodology for the cyclopropanation of alkenes, leveraging a nickel&#8208;catalyzed process in continuous&#8208;flow. The developed protocol demonstrates broad substrate scope, accommodating both electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor alkenes with high functional group tolerance. Beyond dichloromethane as a feedstock methylene source, the methodology enables the synthesis of methylated, deuterated, and chloro&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes. Mechanistic investigations suggest the electro&#8208;generation of a nickel carbene as key intermediate. Notably, the reaction operates under ambient conditions, tolerates air and moisture, and achieves scalability through continuous&#8208;flow technology, offering a straightforward route to multi&#8208;gram quantities with enhanced throughput.

         <title>The First Kleinman&#8208;type Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation Circular Dichroism On/Off Switchable Ferroelectrics</title>

         <dc:description>
The first crown ether&#8208;based chiral ferroelectrics show a ferroelectric phase transition at around 336&#8197;K from the chiral&#8208;polar point group 2 to chiral&#8208;nonpolar 422, which enables the notable switching of second&#8208;harmonic generation circular dichroism (SHG&#8208;CD) response from SHG&#8208;CD active (SHG&#8208;CD on) to inactive (SHG&#8208;CD off) states. Such an on/off switchable SHG&#8208;CD effect is unprecedented.







Abstract
Chiral ferroelectrics have recently received considerable interest due to their unique chiroptical properties. They can adopt Kleinman symmetry second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG)&#8208;active chiral&#8208;polar point groups in the ferroelectric phase while Kleinman symmetry SHG&#8208;inactive chiral&#8208;nonpolar point groups in the paraelectric phase, providing a great opportunity to realize on/off switching of SHG circular dichroism (SHG&#8208;CD) response. However, the SHG&#8208;CD effect was rarely explored in chiral ferroelectrics, and the on/off switchable SHG&#8208;CD has never been reported. Herein, we report the first crown ether&#8208;based chiral ferroelectrics (R/S&#8208;CS)Ca(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6) (CS=camphor&#8208;10&#8208;sulfonic acid), which undergo a 422F2 type ferroelectric phase transition at around 336&#8197;K from Kleinman symmetry SHG&#8208;active point group 2 to Kleinman symmetry SHG&#8208;inactive point group 422. Notably, they exhibit obvious SHG&#8208;CD responses with an anisotropy factor of up to 0.31. More importantly, the SHG&#8208;CD response can be switched between SHG&#8208;CD active (SHG&#8208;CD on) and inactive (SHG&#8208;CD off) states during the ferroelectric phase transition, which is unprecedented. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of Kleinman&#8208;type SHG&#8208;CD on/off switchable ferroelectric. Our findings open up a new way to switch SHG&#8208;CD response based on chiral ferroelectrics, which would greatly inspire the further exploration of switchable SHG&#8208;CD effects in chiral ferroelectrics.

         <title>Chemically Patterning Lithiophilic Interphase to Harmonize Spatial Electrons and Thermal Catalysis Dynamics for Safe Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of elaborated chemically patterning to decorate Cu foil was proposed to harmonize spatial Li+ and facilitate thermal catalysis dynamics for stable and safe lithium metal batteries. The compact electrode with lithiophilic array regulated Li plating/stripping behavior, mitigating Li dendrite formation. Moreover, the composite electrode can suppress smoke and reduce toxicity during the battery thermal runaway process, making a significant improvement for next&#8208;generation safe lithium metal batteries.







Abstract
Lithium metal batteries have garnered significant attention as promising energy storage solutions. However, their performance is often compromised by the risks associated with highly active metallic lithium, unrestricted electrode expansion, and excessive dendrites growth. Here we introduce an advanced lithiophilic anode substrate designed by chemically patterning technology for multiple security enhancements. The innovative lithiophilic array harmonizes spatial Li+ to prepare compact and reversible electrodes. The composite electrodes feature an enhanced C&#8722;F component in the solid&#8208;electrolyte interface, which protects the deposited lithium metal from unwanted side reactions, thereby stabilizing electrochemical cycling. Notably, the thermal safety can be revealed through the substrate&#8216;s excellent catalytic ability to convert smoke and toxic gases during extreme thermal runaway. This work demonstrates a novel approach to integrating battery cycling stability with thermal safety, paving the way for more reliable and secure energy storage systems.

         <title>Rigidly Locked Pyrene Excimers in Planar Chiral Pyrenophanes for Intense and Stable Circularly Polarized Photoluminescence and Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of pyrenophanes with rigidly locked pyrene dimers and varied bridges has been designed and synthesized. These compounds reveal intense and stable circularly polarized photoluminescence (CP&#8208;PL) and electrochemiluminescence (CP&#8208;ECL), thus making them attractive platforms for both fundamental investigations on pyrene excimers and practical applications, such as chiral sensing.







Abstract
Aiming at the construction of novel platforms with excellent performances in both circularly polarized photoluminescence (CP&#8208;PL) and electrochemiluminescence (CP&#8208;ECL), a new family of pyrenophanes with rigidly locked pyrene dimers and varied bridges has been designed and synthesized. Attributed to densely packed pyrene excimers, the resultant pyrenophanes revealed tunable bridge&#8208;dependent emission behaviors, as investigated by femtosecond time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy. More importantly, all these planar chiral pyrenophanes display strong CP&#8208;PL with large dissymmetry factor (gPL) values up to 0.034, and such excellent performances remain stable in a wide range of solvents, temperatures, and concentrations. Attractively, the highest gECL values up to 0.014 reported so far has been achieved for the CP&#8208;ECL emissions of the chiral pyrenophanes. Attributed to their unique structural features and outstanding CPL performances, these novel pyrenophanes could serve as promising platforms for both fundamental investigations on pyrene excimers and practical applications such as chiral sensing.

         <title>Towards Solid&#8208;State Batteries Using a Calcium Hydridoborate Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report the discovery of a fast solid&#8208;state Ca&#8208;ionic conductor based on di(methylamine) calcium tetrahydridoborate. The new compound Ca(BH4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2NH2CH3 crystallizes in a relatively open and flexible layered structure, which allows for fast Ca&#8208;ion migration in the solid state. The calcium plating/stripping behavior is investigated in cell configurations of Ca|Ca(BH4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2NH2CH3|M (M=Pt or Mo) and CaxSn|Ca(BH4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2NH2CH3|Sn.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state batteries created from abundant elements, such as calcium, may pave the way for cheaper and safer electrical energy storage. Here we report a new type of solid calcium hydridoborate electrolyte, Ca(BH4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2NH2CH3, with a high ionic conductivity of &#963;(Ca2+) ~10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at T=70&#8201;&#176;C, which is assigned to a relatively open and flexible structure with apolar moieties and weak dihydrogen bonds that facilitate migration of Ca2+ ions in the solid state. The compound display a low electronic conductivity, providing an ionic transport number close to unity (tion=0.9916). Calcium plating is observed for a Ca|Ca(BH4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2NH2CH3|Pt electrochemical cell and the electrodes are investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) combined with energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDS) that reveal a rugged Ca anode surface owing to the stripping process and the presence of Ca&#8208;containing domains on the Pt working electrode from the plating process. Improved electrochemical reversiblity was achieved in a three&#8208;electrode cell configuration using a CaxSn counter and reference electrode and a Sn working electrode, CaxSn&#8201;|&#8201;Ca(BH4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2NH2CH3&#8201;|&#8201;Sn, providing reversible Ca plating and stripping.

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Synthesis of a Polymer in Two Distinct Topologies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accessing topologically different polymers from single monomer via traditional solution&#8208;state synthesis is impossible. Two different polymorphs underwent spontaneous topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition polymerization and resulted into topologically distinct polymers having 1,4&#8208;disubstituded triazole in the backbone. Furthermore, upon heating at high temperature, both polymorphs exhibited distinct thermoresponses and mechanical properties accompanied by topochemical polymerization.







Abstract
A squaramide&#8208;based monomer, designed for topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) polymerization, crystallizes as two polymorphs, M1 and M2, both having crystal packing suitable for topochemical polymerization. The hydrogen&#8208;bonding between squaramide units bias the molecular organization in both the polymorphs. 3D packing of H&#8208;bonded stacks of monomer lead to juxtaposition of azide and alkyne units of adjacent molecules in a transition&#8208;state&#8208;like arrangement for their regiospecific cycloaddition reaction. The monomers are arranged as supramolecular sheets and supramolecular helices in polymorph M1 and M2 respectively. Both the polymorphs undergo slow and spontaneous regiospecific TAAC polymerization at room temperature, but react quickly at higher temperatures, resulting in 1,4&#8208;traizolyl&#8208;linked polymer, with distinct mechanical responses. Upon heating, single crystals of polymorph M1 show expansion followed by contraction without any permanent dimensional change, whereas crystals of polymorph M2 undergo splitting. At moderate temperatures, both the polymorphs undergo single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) polymerization, resulting in two polymer&#8208;polymorphs with distinct topologies that can be studied at atomic resolution by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The polymorph M1 reacts to polymer P1 with &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;like topology, and polymorph M2 reacts to polymer P2 having polymer chains of helical conformation. Nanoindentation experiments with crystals of these polymers revealed their distinct mechanical properties.

         <title>Photoelectrocatalyzed Alkylation of Phosphonites by Direct Decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8208;P Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inherent oxidation sensitivity of P(III) reagents has long hindered their application in oxidative coupling. However, the synergy of light and electricity enables a general, modular approach to the synthesis of functionalized alkylphosphonites from carboxylic acids under mild reaction conditions using P(III) compounds as limiting reagents. This strategy is applicable to the alkyl modification of medicinally important nucleoside&#8208;derived phosphonites.







Abstract
A photoelectrocatalytic method is presented that achieves direct decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8208;P coupling, providing a modular route to alkylphosphinates and alkylphosphonates from readily available carboxylic acids. The success of this reaction hinges on the synergistic combination of electrochemical anodic oxidation and photocatalytic ligand to metal charge transfer (LMCT) decarboxylation. By employing P(III) reagents as limiting reagents, our approach enables efficient alkyl modification of medicinally important nucleosides and complex molecules derived phosphonites, which were challenging to access by existing methods. Detailed mechanistic studies elucidate the critical roles of Fe catalysts and additives, offering valuable insights into the reaction pathway and laying the foundation for future advancements in photoelectrocatalytic C(sp3)&#8208;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions.

         <title>A Bis&#8208;Perylene Diimide Macrocycle Chiroptical Switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral bis&#8208;perylene diimide macrocycle has been prepared in which point chiral imide groups yield a discrete helical dimer, to mimic a helical supramolecular assembly. The macrocycle exhibits three&#8208;way switching of its chiroptical properties in solution (+/&#8722;/off). This behaviour can be controlled by various stimuli, including the binding of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and identifies important structure&#8208;property relationships for chiral materials.







Abstract
Helical assemblies of organic dyes are ubiquitous chiral organic materials, with valuable properties including chiroptical switching due to the dynamic nature of supramolecular chirality. Herein, we report a novel chiral bis&#8208;perylene diimide macrocycle, which acts as a discrete molecular model for a chiral supramolecular assembly. Point chirality is installed through amino acid&#8208;derived imide groups which, upon macrocyclization, is translated into helical chirality in the perylene diimide dimer. In solution, the macrocycle's chiroptical properties are switchable, with both the sign (+/&#8722;) and amplitude (on/off) of the signal tuned using solvent and molecular recognition stimuli respectively. The chiral structure&#8211;property relationships identified from this macrocycle are important for the design of high fidelity supramolecular chiroptical switches.

         <title>Realizing a 3&#8197;C Fast&#8208;Charging Practical Sodium Pouch Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphorus&#8208;sulfur synergistic solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase has been constructed on the surface of hard carbon anode to reduce the energy barrier of both Na+ desolvation and diffusion. Consequently, a 126&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 Ah&#8208;level practical sodium pouch cell capable of 3&#8197;C fast charging has been achieved. Further, a power&#8208;type pouch cell with a record high charging C&#8208;rate up to 50&#8197;C has also been fabricated.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), endowed with relatively small Stokes radius and low desolvation energy of Na+, are reckoned as a promising candidate for fast&#8208;charging endeavors. However, the C&#8208;rate charging capability of practical energy&#8208;dense sodium&#8208;ion pouch cells is currently limited to &#8804;1&#8197;C, due to the high propensity for detrimental metallic Na plating on the hard carbon (HC) anode at elevated rates. Here, an ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;level sodium&#8208;ion pouch cell capable of 3&#8197;C charging is successfully developed via phosphorus (P)&#8208;sulfur (S) interphase chemistry. By rational electrolyte regulation, desired P&#8722;S constituents, namely, Na3PO4 and Na2SO4, are generated in the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase with favorable Na+ interface kinetics. Specifically, Na+ desolvation energy barrier has been greatly lowered by the weak ion&#8208;solvent coordination near the inner Helmholtz plane on Na3PO4 interphase, while Na2SO4 expedites charge carrier mobility due to its intrinsically high ionic conductivity. Consequently, an energy&#8208;dense (126&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) O3&#8208;Na(Ni1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3)O2||HC pouch cell capable of 3&#8197;C charging (100&#8201;% state of charge) without Na plating can be achieved, with a great capacity retention of 91.5&#8201;% over 200&#8197;cycles. Further, the assembled power&#8208;type Na3V2(PO4)3||HC pouch cell displays an impressive fast&#8208;charging capability of 50&#8197;C, which surpasses that of previously reported high&#8208;power SIBs. This work serves as an enlightenment for developing fast&#8208;charging SIBs.

A novel series of alkynyl&#8208;linked oligomerized electron acceptors have been synthesized via Sonogashira coupling, achieving precise morphology control, reduced non&#8208;radiative losses, and high efficiencies up to 19.52% in ternary solar cells.







Abstract
A novel series of alkynyl&#8208;linked oligomerized electron acceptors have been synthesized via Sonogashira coupling. The alkynyl linkages can enhance molecular planarity and aggregation, suppress electron&#8208;phonon coupling, and reduce non&#8208;radiative losses. Binary organic solar cells (OSCs) achieved an efficiency of 17.90%, with a non&#8208;radiative loss of 0.185 eV, while ternary OSCs reached a remarkable efficiency of 19.52%. Oligomerized electron acceptors, featuring molecular weights akin to polymers and well&#8208;defined chemical structures, have emerged as promising candidates for organic solar cells (OSCs) due to their consistent batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch reproducibility and improved thermal stability. In this study, we developed a series of oligomerized electron acceptors incorporating alkynyl linkages via an efficient Sonogashira coupling reaction between alkyne&#8208;substituted Y&#8208;type precursors and multi&#8208;substituted iodobenzenes. This method produced monomeric (S&#8208;Alkyne&#8208;YF), dimeric (D&#8208;Alkyne&#8208;YF), and trimeric (T&#8208;Alkyne&#8208;YF) configurations, enabling systematic control over molecular size and substituent arms. The alkynyl linkages, characterized by high bond strength and planar geometry, enhanced molecular planarity and aggregation in films, thus facilitating precise control over morphology and phase separation in the photoactive layers. Notably, the inclusion of these linkages effectively suppressed electron&#8208;phonon coupling, resulting in reduced non&#8208;radiative energy losses and elevated photocarrier lifetime. OSCs based on PM6:T&#8208;Alkyne&#8208;YF achieved a power conversion efficiency of 17.90%, a low non&#8208;radiative energy loss of 0.185&#8197;eV, and an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.943&#8197;V. Furthermore, integrating T&#8208;Alkyne&#8208;YF into the D18:N3 blend yielded an exceptional PCE of 19.52%. These results underscore the potential of alkynyl&#8208;linked oligomerized acceptors in advancing highly efficient and stable OSCs, offering a viable pathway for reducing electron&#8208;phonon coupling and enhancing device performance.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Engineered Hydrophilic Perovskite Enabling Surface Potential&#8208;Driven Anions Exchange for Multicolor Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The geometric preorganization induced by C=C bonds in unsaturated alkylamines and the &#8220;bridge&#8221; effect of haloalkanoic acids are harnessed to promote the SN2 reaction and design zwitterionic ligands, enabling CsPbBr3 NCs with hydrophilicity and a 100&#8201;% PLQY. Based on the positive surface potential&#8208;driven fast anion exchange (FAE) reaction, AgI NPs are developed as latent anion exchangers, realizing multicolor biosensing with H2S as an example.







Abstract
The difficulty in designing zwitterionic ligands impedes the water&#8208;dispersed CsPbX3 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) and their application as fast anion exchange (FAE) probes in biosensing. This study proposes a design paradigm for zwitterionic ligands predicated upon revealing the mechanism of the SN2 reaction between unsaturated alkylamines (Cn&#8242;) and haloalkanoic acids (HAAs). Among them, the C=C bond can enhance the nucleophilicity of Cn&#8242; and promote the electrostatic adsorption of HAAs onto Cn&#8242;, i.e., the geometric preorganization process, thereby initiating the SN2 reaction. Moreover, an appropriate &#8220;bridge&#8221; length enables HAAs to balance the geometric preorganization process and the Sigma hole intensity of the C&#8722;Br bond. Zwitterionic ligands derived from oleylamine (C18&#8242;) and 5&#8208;bromovaleric acid (5&#8208;BVA) endow CsPbBr3 NCs with water dispersibility, an almost 100&#8201;% photoluminescence quantum yield, and enhanced surface potential, facilitating the capture of halide ions and driving the FAE reaction. Using AgI nanoparticles (NPs) as latent anion exchangers, a third FAE strategy is presented for multicolor biosensing. Such a robust biosensing strategy can generate wavelength shift and chromatic difference for biological target molecules, exemplified by H2S, and is ultimately applicable to multicolor assay in biological, environmental and food samples, demonstrating the immense potential of perovskite&#8208;based FAE probes in biosensing.

         <title>Innovative asymmetric CoSA&#8208;N&#8208;Ti3C2Tx catalysis: unleashing superoxide radicals for rapid self&#8208;coupling removal of phenolic pollutant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nitrogen&#8208;oxygen double coordination strategy is proposed to create an asymmetrical Co&#8208;N2O3 microenvironment onto Ti3C2Tx. It shows excellent peroxymonosulfate activation capability for the formation of superoxide radical (&#8901;O2&#8722;) and the subsequently completed removal of phenolic pollutants. An &#8901;O2&#8722;&#8208;mediated radical pathway, functioning as a self&#8208;coupling reaction rather than deep oxidation, is proposed for phenolic removal in water.







Abstract
The polymerization pathway of contaminants rivals the traditional mineralization pathway in water purification technologies. However, designing suitable oxidative environments to steer contaminants toward polymerization remains challenging. This study introduces a nitrogen&#8208;oxygen double coordination strategy to create an asymmetrical microenvironment for Co atoms on Ti3C2Tx MXenes, resulting in a novel Co&#8208;N2O3 microcellular structure that efficiently activates peroxymonosulfate. This unique activation capability led to the complete removal of various phenolic pollutants within 3&#8197;min, outperforming the representative Co single&#8208;atom catalysts reported in the past three years. Identifying and recognizing reactive oxygen species highlight the crucial role of &#8901;O2&#8722;. The efficient pollutant removal occurs through a &#8901;O2&#8722;&#8208;mediated radical pathway, functioning as a self&#8208;coupling reaction rather than deep oxidation. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the electron&#8208;rich pollutants transfer more electrons to the catalyst surface, inducing the reduction of dissolved oxygen to &#8901;O2&#8722; in the Co&#8208;N2O3 microregion. In a practical continuous flow&#8208;through application, the system achieved 100&#8201;% acetaminophen removal efficiency in 6.5&#8197;h, with a hydraulic retention time of just 0.98&#8197;s. This study provides new insights into the previously underappreciated role of &#8901;O2&#8722; in pollutant purification, offering a simple strategy for advancing aggregation removal technology in the field of wastewater treatment.

         <title>Soluble Covalent Organic Frameworks as Efficient Lithiophilic Modulator for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing polyethylene glycol as the side chains, two new COFs (CityU&#8208;28 and CityU&#8208;29) not only become soluble for the facile solution processing technique, but also can facilitate the lithium&#8208;ion migration in batteries, which can be utilized as artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase to protect lithium metal anode. Highly improved cycling performance of 5000&#8197;h cycling for symmetric cell and up to 78.9&#8201;% capacity retention after 1500 cycles for LiFePO4 full&#8208;cell are achieved.







Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are regarded as the potential alternative of lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to their ultrahigh theoretical specific capacity (3860&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1). However, severe instability and safety problems caused by the dendrite growth and inevitable side reactions have hindered the commercialization of LMBs. To solve them, in this contribution, a design strategy of soluble lithiophilic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is proposed. By introducing polyethylene glycol as the side chains, two COFs (CityU&#8208;28 and CityU&#8208;29) not only become soluble for the facile coating technique, but also can facilitate the lithium&#8208;ion migration in batteries. Furthermore, when coated on the lithium anode of LMB, both COFs can act as artificial solid electrolyte interphase to prevent dendrite growth thus enabling the long&#8208;term stability of the cells. Notably, the symmetric CityU&#8208;29@Li cell can work for more than 5000&#8197;h at a current density of 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an areal capacity of 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. A remarkable capacity retention of 78.9&#8201;% after 1500&#8197;cycles and a Coulombic efficiency of about 99.9&#8201;% at 1.0&#8197;C can also be realized in CityU&#8208;29@Li||LiFePO4 full cell. This work could provide a universal design strategy for soluble COFs and enlighten their application in diverse scenarios, especially energy&#8208;related fields.

By introducing polyethylene glycol as the side chains, two COFs (&lt;b&gt;CityU-28&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;CityU-29&lt;/b&gt;) not only become soluble for the facile coating technique, but also can facilitate the lithium-ion migration in batteries. Furthermore, when coated on the lithium anode of LMB, both COFs can act as artificial solid electrolyte interphase to prevent dendrite growth thus enabling the long-term stability of the cells. Notably, the symmetric CityU-29@Li cell can work for more than 5000&#8197;h at a current density of 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and an areal capacity of 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. A remarkable capacity retention of 78.9&#8201;% after 1500&#8197;cycles and a Coulombic efficiency of about 99.9&#8201;% at 1.0&#8197;C can also be realized in CityU-29@Li||LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; full cell. This work could provide a universal design strategy for soluble COFs and enlighten their application in diverse scenarios, especially energy-related fields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Liquid Metal Nanobiohybrids for High&#8208;Performance Solar&#8208;Driven Methanogenesis via Multi&#8208;Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>

We developed an innovative nanobiohybrid design strategy using eutectic gallium&#8211;indium alloys (EGaIn) through multi&#8208;interface engineering. The resulting Methanosarcina barkeri (M. b)&#8208;EGaIn nanobiohybrids enabled high&#8208;performance solar&#8208;driven methanogenesis by enhancing proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer involving hydrogen atoms. This study paves the way for sustainable and scalable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;biofuel conversion under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Nanobiohybrids for solar&#8208;driven methanogenesis present a promising solution to the global energy crisis. However, conventional semiconductor&#8208;based nanobiohybrids face challenges such as limited tunability and poor biocompatibility, leading to undesirable spontaneous electron and proton transfer that compromise their structural stability and CH4 selectivity. Herein, we introduced eutectic gallium&#8211;indium alloys (EGaIn), featuring a self&#8208;limiting surface oxide layer surrounding the liquid metal core after sonication, integrated with Methanosarcina barkeri (M. b). The well&#8208;designed M. b&#8211;EGaIn nanobiohybrids exhibited superior performance, achieving a maximum CH4 yield of 455.64&#177;15.99&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1, long&#8208;term stability across four successive 7&#8208;day cycles, and remarkable CH4 selectivity of &gt;99&#8201;%. These improvements stem from enhanced proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer involving hydrogen atoms at the core&#8211;shell interface, further facilitated by the elevated expression of hydrogenases at the abiotic&#8211;biotic interface. This study provides an insightful concept for nanobiohybrid design through multi&#8208;interface engineering, advancing sustainable and scalable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;biofuel conversion under ambient conditions.

         <title>Boosting CO2 Hydrogenation by Synergistic Incorporation of Pure Silica Silicalite&#8208;1 Zeolite and CeO2 into Cu Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a strategy to active Cu centers by synergistically incorporating S1 and CeO2 into the catalytic matrix. S1 stabilizes small&#8208;sized CeO2 and thus enhances the synergistic interaction between Cu and CeO2. This promotes the formation of abundant oxygen vacancies and Cu+ sites at the interface, achieving a simultaneous increase in selectivity and activity.







Abstract
Chemical conversion of CO2 is providing an opportunity to mitigate the global warming induced by the overconsumption of fossil fuel. Cu has been regarded as one of the most powerful contenders in catalyzing CO2 conversion, yet the precise manipulation of its surface state and the nearby chemical environment continues to pose a formidable challenge. In this work, we report a high&#8208;efficiency catalyst by utilizing CeO2 and pure silicon zeolite (S1) to co&#8208;activate Cu species. In CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methanol (CTM) conversion, the space&#8208;time yield of methanol (STYMeOH) of the obtained CuCe/S1 catalysts reaches 87.23&#8197;g&#8201;kgCu&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which represents a fivefold increase compared to that of the Cu/CeO2 catalysts. The following mechanistic investigations reveal that S1 serves as a pivotal stabilizer for the small&#8208;sized CeO2 particles, thereby significantly enhancing the synergistic interaction between Cu species and CeO2. The crafted interaface possesses abundant oxygen vacancies and a high content of Cu+, significantly enhancing the adsorption of CO2 and inhibiting the formation of CO. Our discovery presents a promising new direction for catalyst upgrading and performance enhancement for CTM processes in the foreseeable future.

A 5 e&#8722; high&#8208;kinetics H+&#8208;coupled mechanism gives the Zn&#8208;organic battery high capacity (359&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), large&#8208;current survivability (100&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and ultralong life (60,000&#8197;cycles).







Abstract
Protons (H+) with the smallest size and fastest redox kinetics are regarded as competitive charge carriers in the booming Zn&#8208;organic batteries (ZOBs). Developing new H+&#8208;storage organic cathode materials with multiple ultralow&#8208;energy&#8208;barrier protophilic sites and super electron delocalization routes to propel superior ZOBs is crucial but still challenging. Here we design multiple protophilic redox&#8208;active reticular organic skeletons (ROSs) for activating better proton storage, triggered by intermolecular H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions between 2,6&#8208;diaminoanthraquinone and 2,4,6&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol nanofibrous polymer. ROSs expose reticular electron delocalization geometries to fully access build&#8208;in protophilic carbonyl sites and promote ultrarapid H+ migration with an ultralow activation energy (0.13 vs. 0.29&#8197;eV of Zn2+ ions), thus delivering high capacity (359&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and large&#8208;current survivability (100&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). Moreover, the extended interconnected reticular structures strengthen the anti&#8208;dissolution of ROSs in aqueous electrolytes, affording long&#8208;lasting proton&#8208;storage activity in ZOBs to a superior level (60,000&#8197;cycles at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). Systematic studies identify the source of excellent charge storage as high&#8208;kinetics H+&#8208;coupled five&#8208;electron redox process of carbonyl motifs in superstable ROSs. These findings can be of importance for evoking superior proton activity in multiple redox organics to build advanced Zn&#8208;organic batteries.

         <title>Prescribing DNA Origami Barrel&#8208;Directed Subtractive Patterning of Nanoparticles for Crystalline Superstructure Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using DNA origami barrels, we demonstrate a subtractive patterning strategy to create tunable regiospecific patches on gold nanospheres. This enables the assembly of multidimensional superstructures, such as a graphane&#8208;like bilayered lattice, and provides a geometrical model for reverse engineering assembly symmetries. This approach advances nanoparticle assemblies with distinct symmetries and properties for photonic and electronic applications.







Abstract
Long&#8208;range ordered lattices formed by the directed arrangement of colloidal particles hold significant promise for applications such as photonic crystals, plasmonic metamaterials, and semiconductor electronics. Harnessing regioselective interactions through DNA&#8208;mediated assembly is a promising approach to advancing colloidal assembly. Despite efforts to engineer microscale patchy particles using sequence&#8208;specific binding properties of DNA, the control of patch formation on nanoscale isotropic spherical nanoparticles remains challenging. We demonstrate a subtractive patterning strategy using barrel&#8208;shaped DNA origami (DNA barrel) to selectively block surfaces of DNA&#8208;coated gold nanospheres and create regiospecific patches.

&lt;p&gt;Using DNA origami barrels, we demonstrate a subtractive patterning strategy to create tunable regiospecific patches on gold nanospheres. This enables the assembly of multidimensional superstructures, such as a graphane-like bilayered lattice, and provides a geometrical model for reverse engineering assembly symmetries. This approach advances nanoparticle assemblies with distinct symmetries and properties for photonic and electronic applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long-range ordered lattices formed by the directed arrangement of colloidal particles hold significant promise for applications such as photonic crystals, plasmonic metamaterials, and semiconductor electronics. Harnessing regioselective interactions through DNA-mediated assembly is a promising approach to advancing colloidal assembly. Despite efforts to engineer microscale patchy particles using sequence-specific binding properties of DNA, the control of patch formation on nanoscale isotropic spherical nanoparticles remains challenging. We demonstrate a subtractive patterning strategy using barrel-shaped DNA origami (DNA barrel) to selectively block surfaces of DNA-coated gold nanospheres and create regiospecific patches. By designing binding positions and geometric parameters of DNA barrels, we can achieve controlled accessibility to nanosphere surfaces, forming patchy nanoparticles with tunable patch numbers and sizes. This strategy enables the construction of multidimensional superstructures with well-defined stereo relationships, represented by an unprecedented graphane-like bilayered superlattice. Furthermore, we developed a geometrical model that accounts for anisotropic particle bonding and steric hindrance, elucidating the relationship between architectural outcomes and the structural parameters of DNA-barrel-directed patchy nanoparticles, and enabling reverse engineering designs of potential assembly symmetries. This approach opens new avenues for generating nanoparticle assemblies with distinct symmetries and properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergizing Mg Single Atoms and Ru Nanoclusters for Boosting the Ammonia Borane Hydrolysis to Produce Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme&#8208;mimic Mg single atoms catalysts (SACs) coordinated by B/N&#8208;doped carbon nanotube, was constructed to boost the catalytic performance of Ru catalysts. Mg atoms beneath Ru built an enhanced interfacial electronic metal&#8208;support interaction. Mg SACs adjacent to Ru aided H2O adsorption and activation. The synergistic Mg SACs and Ru nanoclusters promises an excellent catalytic performance for ammonia borane hydrolysis to produce H2.







Abstract
Development of efficient catalysts with high H2O molecule activation ability holds great importance for H2 production. Herein, enzyme&#8208;mimic Mg single atoms catalysts (SACs) coordinated by B/N&#8208;doped carbon nanotube (BNC), was constructed as a high&#8208;performance support for ruthenium (Ru) nano&#8208;clusters. Dual functions of Mg SACs were discovered, where the Mg atoms beneath Ru catalysts built an interfacial electron polarization, inducing electron transfer from Ru to the Mg&#8208;BNC support. In addition, the oxyphilic Mg SACs adjacent to the Ru catalysts could actively participate in H2O adsorption. The combination of experimental characterization, reaction kinetics study and density functional theory (DFT) calculations validated a stronger intrinsic H2O activation capability at the positive Ru sites. Meanwhile, the synergistic Mg SACs jointly contribute to the acceleration of the sluggish H2O dissociation process in ammonia borane (AB) hydrolysis reaction, resulting in exceptional hydrogen production activity and catalytic stability, outperforming most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Ru&#8208;based catalysts. This work provides a new strategy for utilizing alkaline earth metals as both the electronic promoter and the reactant activator, offering inspiration for the development of advanced heterogeneous catalysts.

         <title>Spatial Confinement of a Dual Activatable DNAzyme Sensor in the Cavity of a DNA Nanocage for Logic&#8208;Gated Molecular Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through spatially&#8208;controlled encapsulation of a dual&#8208;activatable DNAzyme sensor within the cavity of a DNA nanocage, a smart nanosensor is presented for correlated imaging of microRNA and metal ions. The cavity of nanocages is accessible to the dual targets, while the confinement effect can provide steric protection of the DNAzyme probe, leading to improved bio&#8208;stability and imaging precision.







Abstract
Despite intense interest in design of DNAzyme sensors for molecular detection and imaging in living cells, their intracellular applications are still hampered by limited spatial control and poor bio&#8208;stability. Here we present controlled spatial confinement of a rationally designed, microRNA (miRNA)&#8208;activatable DNAzyme sensor probe (mDz) within the cavity of DNA nanocage, enabling efficient intracellular delivery with improved bio&#8208;stability for AND&#8208;gate molecular imaging. The mDz that possesses inactive DNAzyme activity is designed by the introduction of a blocking DNA strand, while miR&#8208;21 mediated strand displacement reaction allows for the formation of an intact DNAzyme structure for metal&#8208;ion&#8208;mediated catalytic reaction. Furthermore, the DNA nanocage serves as a nanocarrier for intracellular delivery of mDz, in which the cavity is accessible to the dual targets for logic&#8208;gated molecular imaging, while the confinement effect can provide steric protection of mDz by obstructing nuclease from entering the cavity of the DNA nanocage, resulting in enhanced bio&#8208;stability and improved molecular imaging precision. This strategy paves a way for the engineering of activatable DNA nanosensors with both self&#8208;delivery and self&#8208;protection capabilities to detect diverse intracellular targets.

         <title>Selective Interface Engineering with Large &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Molecules Enables Durable Zn Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A representative large &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecule, bilirubin, is grafted onto multi&#8208;faceted Zn substrates to induce interfacial charge redistribution, elevate the Zn d&#8208;band center, and enhance H+ fixation at the Zn/electrolyte interface. This strategy effectively suppresses Zn dendrite growth and hydrogen evolution reaction, resulting in stable Zn&#8208;ion batteries with long&#8208;term cycling performance.







Abstract
Undesirable dendrite growth and side reactions at the electrical double layer (EDL) of Zn/electrolyte interface are critical challenges limiting the performance of aqueous zinc ion batteries. Through density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that grafting large &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules (e.g. bilirubin, biliverdin, lumirubin, and hemoglobin) onto Zn surface induces preferential adsorption on non&#8208;(002) facets, leading to interfacial charge redistribution, upshifted Zn d&#8208;band center, and enhanced H+ fixation capability. Among these, bilirubin (BR) is identified as the most effective, preferentially adsorbing onto non&#8208;Zn(002) facets to inhibit hydrogen evolution reaction and promote Zn(002) planar growth during plating. This approach results in average Coulombic efficiency of 99.86&#8201;% over 4000 cycles in Zn||BR&#8208;1@Cu cells and prolonged lifespan exceeding 1600&#8197;h in BR&#8208;1@Zn||BR&#8208;1@Zn cells at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Even under harsh conditions of 25&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, BR&#8208;1@Zn||BR&#8208;1@Zn cell maintains a lifespan of over 400&#8197;h. Furthermore, BR&#8208;1@Zn||MnO2 and BR&#8208;1@Zn||NVO full cells achieve 76.4&#8201;% and 86.1&#8201;% capacity retention after 800 and 1400 cycles at 1.0&#8197;A g&#8722;1, respectively. This study underscores the importance of grafting large &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules to allow selective Zn(002) exposure, Zn d&#8208;band center upshift, and EDL structure regulation, paving the way towards durable Zn anodes.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Amino Acid Crystals with Enhanced Piezoelectric Performance for Biodegradable Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluoro&#8208;substitution strategy was developed to enhance the piezoelectric responses of amino acid crystals by altering their molecular dipole moment, energy band gap and charge mobility. This method significantly improved the piezoelectric coefficients, reaching 50.36&#8197;pm/V. The resulting biodegradable and implantable force sensors exhibited high sensitivity and stability, making them ideal for long&#8208;term in vivo monitoring of physiological force signals.







Abstract
Amino acid crystals have emerged as promising piezoelectric materials for biodegradable and biocompatible sensors; however, their relatively low piezoelectric coefficients constrain practical applications. Here, we introduce a fluoro&#8208;substitution strategy to overcome this limitation and enhance the piezoelectric performance of amino acid crystals. Specifically, we substituted hydrogen atoms on the aromatic rings of L&#8208;tryptophan, L&#8208;phenylalanine, and N&#8208;Cbz&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine with fluorine, resulting in significantly elevated piezoelectric coefficients. Density functional theory calculations further indicate that fluorination strengthens polarization by modifying molecular dipole moments. Consequently, these fluoro&#8208;substituted crystals achieve piezoelectric coefficients of up to 50.36&#8197;pm/V, surpassing those of other organic piezoelectric materials such as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), poly(L&#8208;lactic acid) (PLLA), and gelatin. When integrated into flexible, biodegradable force sensors, the fluoro&#8208;substituted crystals exhibit a broad sensing range, high sensitivity, and stable in vivo operation over extended periods. This work establishes a versatile route for boosting piezoelectricity in biomaterials, thereby broadening their scope in biomedical applications.

Here, we introduce a fluoro-substitution strategy to overcome this limitation and enhance the piezoelectric performance of amino acid crystals. Specifically, we substituted hydrogen atoms on the aromatic rings of L-tryptophan, L-phenylalanine, and N-Cbz-L-phenylalanine with fluorine, resulting in significantly elevated piezoelectric coefficients. Density functional theory calculations further indicate that fluorination strengthens polarization by modifying molecular dipole moments. Consequently, these fluoro-substituted crystals achieve piezoelectric coefficients of up to 50.36&#8197;pm/V, surpassing those of other organic piezoelectric materials such as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA), and gelatin. When integrated into flexible, biodegradable force sensors, the fluoro-substituted crystals exhibit a broad sensing range, high sensitivity, and stable in vivo operation over extended periods. This work establishes a versatile route for boosting piezoelectricity in biomaterials, thereby broadening their scope in biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergizing Interfacial Electric Field Regulation and In situ Robust Interphases for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries at High Currents</title>

         <dc:description>
Unstable cycling of lithium metal anode at high currents has hindered the viability of lithium metal batteries. Herein, we report a novel fluorocarbon additive, containing iodine, nitrogen, and fluorine elements, to regulate the interfacial electric field and promote the formation of mechanically robust and ionically conductive electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphases, leading to remarkable electrochemical performances at high current conditions.







Abstract
Efficient cycling of lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) under extremely high current conditions is critical for their practical applications. Here, we report a novel additive containing fluorine, nitrogen, and iodine elements (designated as FCS) to stabilize Li metal anodes in glyme&#8208;based ether electrolytes under high current conditions. Experimental results and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrate that the cation of FCS selectively adsorbs on the electrode surface, optimizing the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) structure and effectively regulating the surface electric field, thereby promoting homogeneous Li deposition. Simultaneously, the preferential decomposition of the FCS produces a mechanically robust and ionically conductive solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) comprising LiF, Li3N, and LiI components. Consequently, with the FCS additive, Li||Cu cells demonstrate a remarkably average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 98.12&#8201;% at an extremely high current of 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over 400 cycles. Additionally, Li||SPAN cells maintain a reversible capacity of 1126&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles. This work presents a new approach to simultaneously tune the Helmholtz plane and SEI using trace amounts of additive, paving the way for stable and efficient LMBs under high&#8208;current conditions.

In their Research Article (e202423070), Jun He, Wei&#8208;Ming Liao et&#160;al. report the construction of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) using carbazole linker and trinuclear clusters, which facilitate photoinduced ligand&#8208;to&#8208;cluster charge transfer (LCCT). The study reveals that the photocatalytic performance for overall water splitting (OWS) via a direct LCCT pathway surpassed that of an indirect LCCT pathway. The direct LCCT mechanism is pivotal in maximizing photon utilization efficiency and ensuring broad&#8208;spectrum OWS.

Polyethylene waste undergoes hydrogenolysis using in situ hydrogen from methanol aqueous phase reforming (APR) over a Ru&#8211;Pt/TiO2 catalyst, achieving 85.1% conversion with 81.0% selectivity for liquid fuels and lubricants. Pt enhances APR&#8208;driven H2 generation, while Ru facilitates C&#9472;C cleavage in polyethylene. Isotope labeling confirms methanol&#8208;derived hydrogen utilization. This approach provides a sustainable alternative to fossil&#8208;derived hydrogen, as reported by Insoo Ro et&#160;al. in their Communication (e202420748).

C. Wang et&#8197;al. recently developed a near&#8208;infrared&#8208;activated charge transfer complex&#8208;based nanoparticle with donor&#8208; acceptor (D&#8211;A) units, which enhances photothermal conversion and generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) synergistically combines photothermal and photodynamic therapies (PTT/PDT). Preclinical experiments have shown a strong immunotherapeutic effect by integrating programmed cell death protein 1 antibody combination therapy. While the use of D&#8211;A units in nanosystems for photoimmunotherapy is still emerging, it holds great potential to revolutionize cancer treatment.







Abstract
Phototherapy&#8212;which includes photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT)&#8212;has evoked interest as a promising cancer treatment modality on account of its noninvasiveness, spatiotemporal precision, and minimal side effects. C. Wang et&#8197;al. recently reported a near&#8208;infrared&#8208;activated charge transfer complex&#8208;based nanoparticle which consists of a donor (D) and an acceptor (A). Experimental results have demonstrated a potent immunotherapeutic effect of integrating programmed cell death protein 1 antibody combination therapy in preclinical models. Incorporating D&#8211;A interactions into nanosystems for photoimmunotherapy (PIT) is still a novel approach. This approach offers a multifaceted strategy for synergistic cancer PIT which holds promising potential to transform cancer treatment paradigms.

         <title>Activatable Photosensitizers: From Fundamental Principles to Advanced Designs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Basic concepts of designing activatable photosensitizers are established in this Review by closely examining quenching mechanisms and bioresponsive constructs essential for their function. New strategies developed in the last five years that address the shortcomings of conventional activatable photosensitizers and which enhance selectivity are also summarized.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising treatment that uses light to excite photosensitizers in target tissue, producing reactive oxygen species and localized cell death. It is recognized as a minimally invasive, clinically approved cancer therapy with additional preclinical applications in arthritis, atherosclerosis, and infection control. A hallmark of ideal PDT is delivering disease&#8208;specific cytotoxicity while sparing healthy tissue. However, conventional photosensitizers often suffer from non&#8208;specific photoactivation, causing off&#8208;target toxicity. Activatable photosensitizers (aPS) have emerged as more precise alternatives, offering controlled activation. Unlike traditional photosensitizers, they remain inert and photoinactive during circulation and off&#8208;target accumulation, minimizing collateral damage. These photosensitizers are designed to &#8220;turn on&#8221; in response to disease&#8208;specific biostimuli, enhancing therapeutic selectivity and reducing off&#8208;target effects. This review explores the principles of aPS, including quenching mechanisms stemming from activatable fluorescent probes and applied to activatable photosensitizers (RET, PeT, ICT, ACQ, AIE), as well as pathological biostimuli (pH, enzymes, redox conditions, cellular internalization), and bioresponsive constructs enabling quenching and activation. We also provide a critical assessment of unresolved challenges in aPS development, including limitations in targeting precision, selectivity under real&#8208;world conditions, and potential solutions to persistent issues (dual&#8208;lock, targeting moieties, biorthogonal chemistry and artificial receptors). Additionally, it provides an in&#8208;depth discussion of essential research design considerations needed to develop translationally relevant aPS with improved therapeutic outcomes and specificity.

         <title>Overcoming Boundaries: Towards the Ambient Aqueous Synthesis of Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The traditional solvothermal method, often requiring harsh conditions, has limited the large&#8208;scale synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). This mini&#8208;review highlights recent advances in the aqueous synthesis of COFs. It also presents the limitations and future perspectives of the aqueous synthesis methods.







Abstract
The synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has traditionally been carried out under strict solvothermal and anaerobic conditions. The utilization of organic solvents in such reactions not only carries significant costs but also imposes a great burden on the environment. The fabrication of COFs using alternative synthetic pathways has, therefore, seen rapid development in recent years and much attention has been placed on green and sustainable methods in particular. The synthesis of COFs in purely aqueous media, however, remains challenging due to the delicate nature of the chemical reactions and the crystallization process in water. This mini&#8208;review discusses different synthetic strategies for the construction of crystalline COFs in aqueous media and offers a perspective on the future development of facile COF synthesis in ambient conditions.

         <title>Photoexcited Transition&#8208;Metal Catalyzed Carbon&#8208;Halogen Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent surge of photoinitiated transition&#8208;metal catalysis has provided a novel gateway to access carbo&#8208;heteroatom bonds and molecular space that was not been previously attainable. Through the use of photoexcited species, the formation of C&#8722;X bonds has sought out new mechanistic pathways, finding alternatives to high reaction temperatures and limiting stoichiometric additives. Herein, we report the recent advances on transition&#8208;metal photocatalyzed carbon&#8208;halogen bond formation, hoping to expand the synthesis toolkit for chemists in industrial and academic laboratories.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal catalysis has proven useful in facilitating carbon&#8208;halogen (C&#8722;X) bond formation. Despite the vast number of methodologies reported to furnish these bonds, limitations have remained, warranting continued development. The recent surge of metallaphotoredox&#8208;based transformations has provided a novel gateway to bypass these limitations. Through the use of photoexcited species, the formation of C&#8722;X bonds arise through new mechanistic pathways, finding alternatives to high reaction temperatures and stoichiometric additives. The discovery of this novel strategy has provided access to molecular space that has not been previously attainable.

&lt;p&gt;The recent surge of photoinitiated transition-metal catalysis has provided a novel gateway to access carbo-heteroatom bonds and molecular space that was not been previously attainable. Through the use of photoexcited species, the formation of C&#8722;X bonds has sought out new mechanistic pathways, finding alternatives to high reaction temperatures and limiting stoichiometric additives. Herein, we report the recent advances on transition-metal photocatalyzed carbon-halogen bond formation, hoping to expand the synthesis toolkit for chemists in industrial and academic laboratories.

         <title>An Amorphous Donor&#8208;Acceptor Conjugated Polymer with Both High Charge Carrier Mobility and Luminescence Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the design and synthesis of a novel donor&#8208;acceptor conjugated polymer, TTIF&#8208;BT, which exhibits both high charge carrier mobility and luminescence quantum efficiency. With a &#934;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#956; value of approximately 0.084&#8197;cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and enhanced interchain&#8208;mediated emissions compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art semiconducting polymer IDT&#8208;BT, TTIF&#8208;BT demonstrates significant potential for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
Organic semiconducting polymers play a pivotal role in the development of field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) and organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), owing to their cost&#8208;effectiveness, structural versatility, and solution processability. However, achieving polymers with both high charge carrier mobility (&#956;) and photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (&#934;) remains a challenge. In this work, we present the design and synthesis of a novel donor&#8208;acceptor &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer, TTIF&#8208;BT, featuring a di&#8208;Thioeno[3,2&#8208;b] ThioenoIndeno[1,2&#8208;b] Fluorene (TTIF) backbone as the donor component. TTIF&#8208;BT exhibits comparable hole mobility and enhanced interchain&#8208;mediated emissions compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art semiconducting IDT&#8208;BT, leading to a remarkable &#934;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#956; value of ~0.084&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Through time&#8208;resolved absorption and PL techniques, we propose a model to extract the spectral weight of interchain&#8208;mediated emissions, yielding 62&#8201;% in TTIF&#8208;BT. Our results introduce a high&#8208;performance semiconducting polymer, which has potential use in next&#8208;generation organic optoelectronic devices, including electrically&#8208;driven polymer lasers and active&#8208;matrix display technologies.

         <title>Renewable Terephthalates and Aromatic Diisocyanates from Galactose</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Preparation of renewable terephthalates and aromatic diisocyanates is presented using a transition metal&#8208;free route through a mild electrochemical decarboxylative aromatization on gram scale. Terephthalates were readily converted into aromatic diisocyanates in flow and used to synthesize 100&#8201;% renewable thermoplastic polyurethanes.







Abstract
Aromatic diisocyanates, invaluable commodity chemicals for polymer manufacturing, are produced annually on megaton scales from petroleum&#8208;derived diamines via phosgenation. Existing routes toward renewable alternatives are sparse and limited by access to functionalized aromatic starting materials, such as terephthalates. Herein, we report the development of a robust route to renewable terephthalates and aromatic diisocyanates from D&#8208;galactose via Eastwood olefination and Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition, followed by a mild electrochemical decarboxylative aromatization. This process was developed and applied on gram&#8208;scale to synthesize terephthalates, which were transformed into aromatic diisocyanates via Curtius rearrangement in flow. We demonstrate gram&#8208;scale preparation of 1,4&#8208;phenylene diisocyanate and 2,5&#8208;toluene diisocyanate and formulation of these monomers to prepare fully renewable thermoplastic polyurethanes. Preparation of these renewable aromatic diisocyanates proceeds without the use of high&#8208;pressure gases or costly transition&#8208;metals and represents a novel route to fully renewable aromatic diisocyanates.

         <title>Catalytic Amino Group Transfer Reactions Mediated by Photoinduced Nitrene Formation from Rhodium&#8208;Hydroxamates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We investigated the photoinduced generation of Rh&#8208;acylnitrenoids and their catalytic nitrene transfer reactivity using thermally stable, yet photoactive Rh&#8208;hydroxamate. Combined EPR, mass, and DFT studies suggested that Fischer&#8208;type Rh&#8208;acylnitrenoid species could be furnished via the photoactivation of Rh&#8208;hydroxamates. Further catalytic amidation reactivity of hydrocarbons, amines, and alcohols to form new C&#8722;N, N&#8722;N, and N&#8722;O bonds was explored.







Abstract
Herein, we report a photocatalytic platform to access transient nitrenoids by designing photo&#8208;responsive neutral rhodium&#8208;hydroxamate complexes. Combined experimental and computational mechanistic studies, including electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and mass spectrometric analysis, suggest that electrophilic Fischer&#8208;type Rh&#8208;acylnitrenoid intermediates could be generated via photoactivation of corresponding Rh&#8208;hydroxamates via N&#8208;O bond homolysis and redox event. Moreover, catalytic acylnitrenoid transfer was explored toward the amidation of various hydrocarbons, amines, and alcohols to furnish new N&#8722;C, N&#8722;N, and N&#8722;O bonds.

         <title>Direct CO2 Activation and Conversion to Ethanol via Reactive Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach to activate and convert CO2 in dissolved as well as gaseous form via reactive oxygen species was established. Within only 5&#8197;h reaction time at atmospheric conditions, room temperature a conversion efficiency of 92&#8201;% from CO2 to 12.2&#8197;mmol/L ethanol was achieved. Direct Air Capture experiments gave similar results, which showcases both the inherent flexibility of this method as well as its efficiency.







Abstract
The growing demand for energy and the excessive use of fossil fuels represents one of the main challenges for humanity. Storing solar energy in the form of chemical bonds to generate solar fuels or value&#8208;added chemicals without creating additional environmental burdens is a key requirement for a sustainable future. Here we use biomimetic artificial photosynthesis and present a dPCN&#8208;224(H) MOF&#8208;based photocatalytic system, which uses reactive oxygen species (ROS) to activate and convert CO2 to ethanol under atmospheric conditions, at room temperature and in 2&#8211;5&#8197;h reaction time. The system provides a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion efficiency (CTE) of 92&#8201;%. Furthermore, this method also allows the conversion of CO2 through direct air capture (DAC), making it a rapid and versatile method for both dissolved and gaseous CO2.

         <title>Charge Polarization Boosting Electrochemical Urea Synthesis by Co&#8208;Reduction of CO2 and Nitrite in Dilute Concentrations with a Unity Carbon Selectivity</title>

A dual site catalyst Cu@Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C with single Fe atom and Cu NPs on N&#8208;doped carbon to enhance the coupling of CO2 and dilute NO2&#8722; (100&#8197;ppm NO2&#8722;&#8208;N) for urea synthesis. The Cu@Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C exhibits a high FEurea of 50.05&#8201;% with a flow cell at &#8722;0.35&#8197;V (vs. RHE). Furthermore, the Curea&#8208;selectivity reaches to 100&#8201;% and a near&#8208;unity selectivity for the value&#8208;added urea and NH3 is realized.







Abstract
Synthesis of urea through electrocatalytic coupling reaction of CO2 with nitrite (NO2&#8722;) represents a sustainable means to substitute the conventional energy&#8208;intensive urea synthetic protocol. The direct conversion of dilute NO2&#8722; in real wastewaters to urea with high efficiency is still a significant challenge, as C&#8208;intermediates tend to go through an extensive reduction achieving mostly C&#8208;containing productions due to the lack of N&#8208;intermediates, originating from slow diffusion rate of NO2&#8722;. Herein, we report the charge&#8208;polarized Fe&#948;&#8722;&#8208;Cu&#948;+ dual sites in metal/carbon heterojunction material (Cu@Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C) for co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and dilute NO2&#8722; solution (100&#8197;ppm NO2&#8722;&#8208;N). The electron&#8208;rich single Fe atoms dispersed N&#8208;doped carbon (Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C) restrain *CO desorption, and the electron&#8208;deficient Cu nanoparticles (Cu) promote the deep reduction of NO2&#8722; to *NH2. As a result, the obtained Cu@Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C exhibits a high Faradaic efficiency for urea of 50.05&#8201;% with a yield of 850.57&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.35&#8197;V (vs. RHE) in a flow cell. Moreover, Curea&#8208;selectivity reaches to 100&#8201;% and a near&#8208;unity selectivity for the value&#8208;added urea and NH3 is realized. The present results provide a valuable reference for the design of new catalysts for efficient synthesis of C&#8722;N compounds in dilute NO2&#8722; solution.

         <title>Halogenated Trityl Cations as Easy&#8208;to&#8208;Access Super Electrophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we present the easy&#8208;to&#8208;access synthesis of the perfluorotrityl cation and the further functionalization of its para&#8208;fluorine atoms via halodefluorination using trimethylsilyl halides TMSX (X=Cl, Br). This enables the synthesis of equally reactive halogenated trityl derivatives, that can be handled at room&#8208;temperature. Their super&#8208;electrophilicity is demonstrated by hydride abstraction from the short&#8208;chain, linear alkanes n&#8208;pentane and n&#8208;butane.







Abstract
Herein, we present the easy&#8208;to&#8208;access synthesis of the perfluorotrityl cation (15F+) with commercial GaCl3 and the further functionalization of the para&#8208;fluorine atoms of 15F+ via halodefluorination using trimethylsilyl halides TMSX (X=Cl, Br). This gives access to equally reactive halogenated trityl derivatives (p&#8208;3Cl12F+ and p&#8208;3Br12F+), which can be handled at room temperature. The impact of the para&#8208;exchange on the electronic structure is determined by NMR and UV/Vis spectroscopy. Finally, the new synthons&#8242; high hydride ion affinities are demonstrated computationally and experimentally by hydride abstraction from the short&#8208;chain, linear alkanes n&#8208;pentane and n&#8208;butane.
