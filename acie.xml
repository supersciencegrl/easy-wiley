      <title>Signaling in Systems Chemistry: Programing Gold Nanoparticles Formation and Assembly Using a Dynamic Bistable Network</title>
      <dc:description>Living cells exploit bistable and oscillatory behaviors as memory mechanisms, facilitating the integration of transient stimuli into sustained molecular responses that control downstream functions. Synthetic bistable networks have also been studied as memory entities, but have rarely been utilized to control orthogonal functions in coupled dynamic systems. We herein present a new cascade pathway, for which we have exploited a well&#8208;characterized switchable peptide&#8208;based replicating network, operating far from equilibrium, that yields two alternative steady state outputs, which in turn serve as the input signals for consecutive processes that regulate various features of Au nanoparticle shape and assembly.

      <dc:description>The cell membrane is not only a physical barrier, but also a functional organelle regulating the communication between a cell and its environment. An ability to functionalize the cell membrane with synthetic molecules or nanostructures would advance cellular functions beyond what the evolution of nature has provided. The purpose of this minireview is to introduce recent progress in using synthetic DNA and DNA&#8208;based nanostructures for cell surface engineering. We first introduce chemical conjugation and physical binding methods for monovalent and polyvalent surface engineering.

      <title>Controlling Intramolecular F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer and Singlet Fission in a Subporphyrazine&#8208;Pentacene Conjugate by Solvent Polarity</title>
      <dc:description>Due its complementary absorptions in the range of 450 and 600 nm, an energy&#8208;donating hexaaryl&#8208;subporphyrazine has been linked to a pentacene dimer, which acts primarily as energy acceptor and secondarily as a singlet fission enabler. In the corresponding conjugate, efficient intramolecular F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (i&#8208;FRET) is the modus operandi to transfer energy from the subporphyrazine to the pentacene dimer. Upon energy transfer, the pentacene dimer undergoes intramolecular singlet fission (i&#8208;SF), that is, converting the singlet excited state, via an intermediate state, into a pair of correlated triplet excited states. Solvatochromic fluorescence of the subporphyrazine is a key feature of this system and features a red&#8208;shift as large as 20 nm in polar media. Solvent is thus used to modulate spectral overlap between the fluorescence of subporphyrazine and absorption of the pentacene dimer, which controls the F&#246;rster rate constant, on one hand, and the triplet quantum yield, on the other hand. The optimum spectral overlap is realized in xylene, leading to F&#246;rster rate constant of 3.52 &#215; 10  11  s  &#8211;1  and a triplet quantum yield of 171% &#177; 10%. In short, the solvent polarity dependence, which is a unique feature of subporphyrazines, is decisive in terms of adjusting spectral overlap, ensuring a sizable F&#246;rster rate constant, and maximizing triplet quantum yields. Uniquely, this optimization can be achieved without a need for synthetic modification of the subporphyrazine donor.</dc:description>

Solvent is thus used to modulate spectral overlap between the fluorescence of subporphyrazine and absorption of the pentacene dimer, which controls the F&#246;rster rate constant, on one hand, and the triplet quantum yield, on the other hand. The optimum spectral overlap is realized in xylene, leading to F&#246;rster rate constant of 3.52 &#215; 10  11  s  &#8211;1  and a triplet quantum yield of 171% &#177; 10%. In short, the solvent polarity dependence, which is a unique feature of subporphyrazines, is decisive in terms of adjusting spectral overlap, ensuring a sizable F&#246;rster rate constant, and maximizing triplet quantum yields. Uniquely, this optimization can be achieved without a need for synthetic modification of the subporphyrazine donor.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Introducing tox&#8208;Profiles of Chemical Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>
In this Essay we propose tox&#8208;Profiles of chemical reactions to eliminate misleading preconceptions about the biological activity of organic molecules and to stimulate further progress in the field. tox&#8208;Profiles can be used to classify synthetic reactions, mange the biological activity of molecules, and guide the rational development of new methodologies.







Abstract
In this Essay, we present a critical analysis of two common practices in modern chemistry&#8212;that is, of using speculations about the &#8220;greenness&#8221; and &#8220;nontoxicity&#8221; of developed synthesis procedures and of a priori labelling various compounds derived from natural sources as being environmentally safe. We note that every organic molecule that contains functional groups should be biologically active. Thus, analysis of the particular greenness and the potential environmental impact of a given chemical process should account for the biological activity of all its components in a measureable (rather than empirical) way. We highlight the necessity of clarifying discussions on biological activity and toxicity and propose possible ways of introducing tox&#8208;Profiles as a reliable overview of the overall toxicity of chemical reactions.

      <title>Engineering Atomically Dispersed FeN4 Active Sites for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
      <dc:description>Atomically dispersed FeN  4  active sites have exhibited exceptional catalytic activity and selectivity for the electrochemical CO  2  reduction reaction (CO2RR) to CO. However, the understanding behind the intrinsic and morphological factors contributing to the catalytic properties of FeN  4  sites is still lacking. Using a Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C model catalyst derived from the ZIF&#8208;8, we deconvoluted three key morphological and structural elements of FeN  4  sites, including particle sizes of catalysts, Fe content, and Fe&#8208;N bond structures. Their monotonous effects on the CO2RR were comprehensively elucidated. Engineering the particle size and Fe doping is critical to control extrinsic morphological factors of FeN  4  sites for optimal porosity, electrochemically active surface areas, and the graphitization of the carbon support. In contrast, the intrinsic activity of FeN  4  sites was only tunable by varying thermal activation temperatures during the formation of FeN  4  sites, which impacted the length of the Fe&#8208;N bonds and the local strains. The structural evolution of Fe&#8208;N bonds was characterized at the atomic level. First&#8208;principles calculations further elucidated the origin of intrinsic activity improvement associated with the optimal local strain on the Fe&#8208;N bond.</dc:description>

      <title>Dye&#8208;Doped Silica Nanoparticles for Enhanced ECL&#8208;Based Immunoassay Analytical Performance</title>
      <dc:description>
Using silica nanoparticles, a 8.5&#8208;fold higher ECL intensity was achieved with respect to a system mimicking a commercial immuno&#8208;sensing system, benefiting from the deep knowledge acquired by combining ECL with nanostructures.







Abstract
The combination of highly sensitive techniques such as electrochemiluminescence (ECL) with nanotechnology sparked new analytical applications, in particular for immunoassay&#8208;based detection systems. In this context, nanomaterials, particularly dye&#8208;doped silica nanoparticles (DDSNPs) are of high interest, since they can offer several advantages in terms of sensitivity and performance. In this work we synthesized two sets of monodispersed and biotinylated [Ru(bpy)3]2+&#8208;doped silica nanoparticles, named bio&#8208;Triton@RuNP and bio&#8208;Igepal@RuNP, obtained following the reverse microemulsion method using two different types of nonionic surfactants. Controlling the synthetic procedures, we were able to obtain nanoparticles (NPs) offering highly intense signal, using tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine (TPrA) as coreactant, with bio&#8208;Triton@RuNps being more efficient than bio&#8208;Igepal@RuNP.

      <title>Interlayer Engineering of &#945;&#8208;MoO3 Modulates Selective Hydronium Intercalation in Neutral Aqueous Electrolyte</title>
      <dc:description>Among various charge carrier ions for aqueous batteries, non&#8208;metal hydronium (H3O+) with small ionic size and fast diffusion kinetics empowers H3O+&#8208;intercalation electrodes with high rate performance and fast&#8208;charging capability. However, pure H3O+  charge carriers for inorganic electrode materials have only been observed in corrosive acidic electrolytes, rather than in mild neutral electrolytes. Here, we report how selective H3O+  intercalation in a neutral ZnCl2  electrolyte can be achieved for water&#8208;proton co&#8208;intercalated &#945;&#8208;MoO3  (denoted WP&#8208;MoO3  ). H2O molecules located between MoO3  interlayers are disclosed to block Zn2+  intercalation pathways while allowing smooth H3O+  intercalation/diffusion through a Grotthuss proton conduction mechanism. Compared to &#945;&#8208;MoO3  with Zn2+&#8208;intercalation mechanism, WP&#8208;MoO3  delivers the substantially enhanced specific capacity (356.8  vs.  184.0 mA h g&#8722;1), rate capability (77.5%  vs.  42.2% from 0.4 to 4.8 A g&#8722;1), and cycling stability (83%  vs.  13% over 1000 cycles). This work demonstrates the possibility of modulating electrochemical intercalating ions by interlayer engineering, which indicates a promising direction to construct high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;life electrodes for aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

      <title>Real&#8208;time Monitoring Reveals Dissolution/Redeposition Mechanism in Cu Nanocatalysts during the Initial Stages of the CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Size, morphology and surface sites of electrocatalysts have a major impact on their performance. Understanding how, when, and why these parameters change under operating conditions is of uttermost importance for designing stable, active, and selective catalysts. Here, we study the reconstruction of a Cu&#8208;based nanocatalysts during the startup phase of the electrochemical CO  2  reduction reaction by combining results from electrochemical in&#8208;situ transmission electron microscopy with operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. We reveal that dissolution followed by redeposition, rather than coalescence, is the mechanism responsible for the size increase and morphology change of the electrocatalyst. Furthermore, we point out the key role played by the formation of copper oxides in the process. Understanding of the underlying processes opens a pathway to rational design of Cu electro (re)deposited catalysts and to stability improvement for catalysts fabricated by other methods.</dc:description>

      <title>Effect of hydrophilic monomer distribution on self&#8208;assembly of a pH&#8208;responsive copolymer: Spheres, worms and vesicles from a single copolymer composition</title>

      <title>MOF&#8208;Directed Synthesis of Crystalline Ionic Liquid with Enhanced Proton Conduction</title>
      <dc:description>Arranging ionic liquids (ILs) with long&#8208;range order can not only enhance their performances in a desired application, but can also help elucidate the vital relationship between structure and properties. However, achieving long&#8208;range ordered ILs is still a formidable challenge and no successful example has been reported to date. In this work, we report a feasible strategy to achieve a crystalline IL via coordination self&#8208;assembly based reticular chemistry. The first crystalline IL bearing a long&#8208;range ordered framework,  IL  1  MOF  , was prepared by designing an IL bridging ligand and then connecting them with metal clusters.  IL  1  MOF  possesses a very unique structure, where the IL ligands are arranged on a long&#8208;range ordered framework but have a labile ionic center. This structure enables  IL  1  MOF  to break through the typical limitation where the solid ILs have lower proton conductivity than their counterpart bulk ILs.  IL  1  MOF  shows 2&#8208;4 orders of magnitude higher proton conductivity than its counterpart IL monomer across a wide temperature range. Its conductivity is also an order magnitude higher than the highest reported values for solid protic IL derivatives and MOF&#8208;based anhydrous proton conductors at room temperature. Moreover, by confining the IL within ultramicropores (&lt; 1 nm),  IL  1  MOF  suppresses the liquid&#8208;solid phase transition temperatures to lower than &#8208;150  o  C, allowing it to function with high conductivity in a subzero temperature range.

      <title>A General Strategy to Control Viscosity Sensitivity of Molecular Rotor&#8208;Based Fluorophores</title>
      <dc:description>Molecular rotor&#8208;based fluorophores (RBFs) have been widely used in many fields. However, it remained enigmatic how to rationally control their viscosity sensitivity, thus limiting their application. Herein, we resolve this problem by chemically installing extended &#960;&#8208;rich alternating carbon&#8208;carbon linkage between the rotational electron donor and acceptor of RBFs. Our data reveal that the length of &#960;&#8208;rich linkage strongly influences the viscosity sensitivity, likely resulted from varying height of the energy barriers between the fluorescent planar and the dark twisted configurations. This mechanism allows for the design of three scaffolds of RBF derivatives that span a wide range of viscosity sensitivities. Application of these RBFs is demonstrated by a dual&#8208;color imaging strategy that can differentiate misfolded protein oligomers and insoluble aggregates both in test tubes and live cells. Beyond RBFs, we envision that this chemical mechanism might be generally applicable to a wide range of photoisomerizable and aggregation&#8208;induced emission fluorophores.</dc:description>

      <title>Bimetallic, Silylene&#8208;Mediated Multielectron Reductions of Carbon Dioxide and Ethylene</title>
      <dc:description>A metal/ligand cooperative approach to reduction of small molecules by metal silylene complexes (R2Si=M) is demonstrated, whereby silicon activates the incoming substrate and mediates net two&#8208;electron transformations via one&#8208;electron redox processes at two metal centers.

Experimental and computational studies suggest a plausible mechanism proceeding via [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition to the silylene complex that is quite sensitive to steric environment. The Co(II)/Co(II) products are further reactive to oxidation and reduction.

A robust surface between molecules and electrodes is important for the construction of molecular and electronic devices. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202006318), Y. Tian et&#8197;al. demonstrate that the Au&#8722;C&#8801;C bond is highly stable under thiol&#8208;abundant conditions and shows better electrochemical performance compared to Au&#8722;S and Au&#8722;Se bonds.

Cowan et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202010405) utilize solution&#8208;chemistry in a solid&#8208;state reaction for the separation of alkenes and alkanes, leading to potentially major effects on reducing global energy use and global warming. In&#8208;situ PXRD was used to watch the reversible trimer to dimer rearrangement in the solid&#8208;state, where multiple bonds are broken and reformed.&#160;The rapid uptake and release, the minimal heat of adsorption of alkene, and the reusability of these materials make the process a sustainable alternative for distillation methods.

Cowan et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.20201040510.1002/anie.202010405&lt;/a&gt;) utilize solution&#8208;chemistry in a solid&#8208;state reaction for the separation of alkenes and alkanes, leading to potentially major effects on reducing global energy use and global warming. In&#8208;situ PXRD was used to watch the reversible trimer to dimer rearrangement in the solid&#8208;state, where multiple bonds are broken and reformed.&#160;The rapid uptake and release, the minimal heat of adsorption of alkene, and the reusability of these materials make the process a sustainable alternative for distillation methods.

      <dc:description>
A polar lead mixed oxyhalide, Pb18O8Cl15I5, representing the first synthetic metal oxyhalide combining both Cl&#8722; and I&#8722; featuring two types of oxo&#8208;centered Pb&#8211;O units with different dimensionality is reported by K.&#8197;M. Ok et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202009541). Characterizations based on the centimeter&#8208;sized single crystals reveal that Pb18O8Cl15I5 satisfies all fundamental yet rigorous criteria for high&#8208;performance IR NLO materials.

      <title>Strong Fermi resonance associated with proton motions revealed by vibrational spectra of asymmetric proton bound dimers</title>
      <dc:description>Experimental infrared spectra between 2600 to 3800 cm  &#8208;1  for a series of asymmetric proton bound dimers with protonated trimethylamine (TMA&#8211;H  +  ) as the proton donor were recorded and analyzed. Based on conventional wisdom, the frequency of the N&#8208;H  +  stretching mode is expected to red shift as the proton affinity of proton acceptors (Ar, N  2  , CO, C  2  H  2  , H  2  O, CH  3  OH, and C  2  H  5  OH) increases. The observed band, however, shows a peculiar splitting of ~300 cm  &#8208;1  with the intensity shifting pattern resembling a two&#8208;level system. Theoretical investigation based on  ab initio  anharmonic algorithms reveals that the observed band splitting and its extraordinarily large gap of ~300 cm  &#8208;1  is a result of strong coupling between fundamental of the proton stretching mode and overtone states of the two proton bending modes, that is commonly known as Fermi resonance (FR). We also provide a simple and general theoretical model to link the strong FR coupling to the quasi&#8208;two&#8208;level system behavior in the observed band intensity. Since the model does not depend on the molecular specification of TMA&#8211;H  +  , the strong coupling we observed here is an intrinsic property associated with proton motions in a wide range of molecular systems.</dc:description>

      <title>Polyurethanes from Direct Organocatalytic Copolymerization of p&#8208;Tosyl Isocyanate with Epoxides</title>
      <dc:description>The direct copolymerization of  p  &#8208;tosyl isocyanate (TSI) with epoxides, initiated by onium salts in the presence of trialkylborane, to produce polyurethanes is reported. The rate of copolymerization and the (regio)selectivity were investigated in relation to the trialkylborane and initiator used.

      <title>A Potent and Selective Janus Kinase Inhibitor with a Chiral 3D&#8208;Shaped Triquinazine Ring System from Chemical Space</title>
      <dc:description>The Generated DataBases (GDBs) enumerate billions of possible molecules following simple rules of chemical stability and synthetic feasibility. Exploring the GDBs shows that many chiral, 3D&#8208;shaped ring systems, often containing quaternary centers, have never been exploited for drug design. Herein we show that such ring systems can be useful for medicinal chemistry at the example of the enantioselective synthesis of triquinazine, a novel chiral piperazine analog derived from angular triquinane, and it&#8217;s use to design a nanomolar and selective inhibitor of Janus Kinase 1 related to the marketed drug Tofacitinib useful to treat auto&#8208;immune diseases.</dc:description>

      <title>Switching the Reactivity of Palladium Diimines with &#8216;Ancillary&#8217; Ligand to Select for Olefin Polymerization, Branching Regulation, or Olefin isomerization</title>
      <dc:description>Coordinating solvents are commonly employed as ancillary ligands to stabilize late transition metal complexes and are conventionally considered to have little effect on the reaction products. Our work identifies that the presence of ancillary ligand in Pd&#8208;diimine catalyzed polymerizations of &#945;&#8208;olefins can drastically alter reactivity. The addition of different amounts of acetonitrile allows for switching between distinct reaction modes: isomerization&#8208;polymerization with high branching (0 eq.), regular chain&#8208;walking polymerization (1 eq.), and alkene isomerization with no polymerization (&gt;20 eq.). Optimization of the isomerization reaction mode led to a general set of conditions to switch a wide variety of diimine complexes into efficient alkene isomerization catalysts, with catalyst loading as low as 0.005 mol%.</dc:description>

      <title>Salt to Taste: The Critical Roles Played by Inorganic Salts in Organozinc Formation and in the Negishi Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>The first cross&#8208;coupling of organozinc nucleophiles with aryl halides was reported in 1977 by Negishi. Unknown to all at the time was the importance of salt additives that were often present as a byproduct from the organozinc preparation. For decades, these salt additives were overlooked until 2006 when it was discovered that two different, yet effective methods for preparing organozinc solutions (i.e. one with salt and one without) provided drastically different results. Since this finding, the exact role of salt additives in cross&#8208;coupling has been debated in the catalysis community. In this review we highlight all the major discoveries regarding the influence of salt additives on the formation of organozinc reagents and their use in the Negishi reaction. These effects include solubilizing key intermediates, the formation of higher order zincates, product inhibition, catalyst protection and solvent effects.</dc:description>

      <title>H2&#8208;free Re&#8208;based catalytic dehydroxylation of aldaric acid to muconic and adipic acid esters</title>
      <dc:description>Being one of the most demanded dicarboxylic acids, adipic acid can be directly produced from renewable sources.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Being one of the most demanded dicarboxylic acids, adipic acid can be directly produced from renewable sources.

Herein, we proposed a supramolecular strategy to regulate the activity of PS, fabricating a supramolecular PS with improved reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation efficiency and accelerated self&#8208;degradation ability. During PDT treatment, the supramolecular PS exhibited good therapeutic efficiency as well as reduced dark toxicity. Moreover, the supramolecular PS could be degraded by ROS generated by itself and lose its PDT activities once PDT treatment finished. In this way, the side effects of PDT can be reduced without sacrificing the therapeutic efficiency. This work provides a novel strategy for smarter PDT beacon to further improve the safety of PDT treatment.</dc:description>

      <title>Photodriven Disproportionation of Nitrogen and Its Change to Reductive Nitrogen Photofixation</title>
      <dc:description>Nitrogen fixation is an essential process for sustaining life. Tremendous efforts have been made on the photodriven fixation of nitrogen into ammonia. However, the disproportionation of dinitrogen to ammonia and nitrate under ambient conditions has yet remained a grand challenge. In this work, the photodriven disproportionation of nitrogen is realized in water under visible light and ambient conditions using Fe&#8208;doped TiO  2  microspheres. The oxygen vacancies associated with the Fe dopants activate chemisorbed N  2  molecules, which can then be fixed into NH  3  with H  2  O  2  as the oxidation product. The generated H  2  O  2  thereafter oxidizes NH  3  into nitrate. This disproportionation reaction can be turned to the reductive one by loading plasmonic Au nanoparticles in the doped TiO  2  microspheres. The generated H  2  O  2  can be effectively decomposed by the Au nanoparticles, resulting in the transformation of the disproportionation reaction to the completely reductive nitrogen photofixation.</dc:description>

      <title>Regulating Interfacial Chemistry in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries by a Weakly&#8208;Solvating Electrolyte</title>
      <dc:description>The performance of Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is highly dependent on their interfacial chemistry, which is regulated by electrolytes. Conventional electrolyte typically contains polar solvents to dissociate Li salts. Herein we report a weakly&#8208;solvating electrolyte (WSE) that consists of a pure non&#8208;polar solvent, which leads to a peculiar solvation structure where ion pairs and aggregates prevail under a low salt concentration of 1.0 M. Importantly, WSE forms unique anion&#8208;derived interphases on graphite electrodes that exhibit fast&#8208;charging and long&#8208;term cycling characteristics. First&#8208;principles calculations unravel a general principle that the competitive coordination between anions and solvents to Li ions is the origin of different interfacial chemistries. By bridging the gap between solution thermodynamics and interfacial chemistry in batteries, this work opens a brand&#8208;new way towards precise electrolyte engineering for energy storage devices with desired properties.</dc:description>

First&#8208;principles calculations unravel a general principle that the competitive coordination between anions and solvents to Li ions is the origin of different interfacial chemistries. By bridging the gap between solution thermodynamics and interfacial chemistry in batteries, this work opens a brand&#8208;new way towards precise electrolyte engineering for energy storage devices with desired properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A Novel Fabrication Strategy for MOFs Films/Aerogel Composite Catalysts via Substrate&#8208;seeding Secondary&#8208;growth</title>
      <dc:description>Substrate&#8208;supported metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) films are urgently desired for realizing their great potential in practical applications. Herein, a novel substrate&#8208;seeding secondary&#8208;growth strategy was developed to fabricate composite of uniform MOFs films on aerogel walls. Briefly, the organic ligand is &#8220;pre&#8208;seeded&#8221; onto the aerogel walls, and then a small amount of metal ions solution is sprayed onto the prepared aerogel. The sprayed solution is diffused along the aerogel walls to form a continuous thin layer, which confines the nucleation reaction, promoting the formation of uniform MOFs films on the aerogel walls. The whole fabrication process is simple in operation, highly efficient and eco&#8208;friendly. The resulted hierarchical MOFs/aerogel composites possess abundant accessible active sites and enables excellent mass transfer, which endows the composite outstanding catalytic activity and stability in both liquid phase CO2 cycloaddition and electrochemical OER process.</dc:description>

      <title>The key role of the interface in the highly sensitive mechanochromic luminescence properties of hybrid perovskites</title>
      <dc:description>Hybrid perovskite (HP) materials are of huge interest in both photovoltaics and lighting applications. Here we report that hybrid perovskite composites, as crystallized powders, can behave as intelligent materials showing highly sensitive and reversible mechanochromic luminescence (MCL). Composites consisting of monolayered 2D HP and 3D HP components exhibit reversible tunable colour emission upon mechanical strain. Spectroscopic investigations first reveal that the bluish&#8208;whitish emission of the 2D HP turns into orange in the composite due to an energy transfer process. The bright green emission, observed as soon as the composite is slightly crushed, originates from the 3D HP after efficient energy funnelling from the multi&#8208;layered 2D HP produced at the 2D/3D interface by the mechanical treatment. Besides highlighting the key role of the interfaces in light emission of HP, our findings pave the way for hybrid perovskites as highly sensitive MCL smart materials for mechanosensors, security papers or optical storage applications.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>We report here the in&#8208;cell NMR&#8208;spectroscopic observation of the binding of the cognate ligand 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyguanosine to the aptamer domain of the bacterial 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyguanosine&#8208;sensing riboswitch in eukaryotic cells, namely Xenopus laevis oocytes and in human HeLa cells. The riboswitch is sufficiently stable in both cell types to allow for detection of binding of the ligand to the riboswitch. Most importantly, we show that the binding mode established by in vitro characterization of this prokaryotic riboswitch is maintained in eukaryotic cellular environment. Our data also bring important methodological insights: Thus far, in&#8208;cell NMR studies on RNA in mammalian cells have been limited to investigations of short (&lt; 15 nt) RNA fragments that were extensively modified by protecting groups to limit their degradation in the intracellular space.

      <title>Design, Identification and Evolution of Surface Ruthenium (II/III) Single&#8208;Site for CO Activation</title>
      <dc:description>Ru(II) compounds are widely used in catalysis, photocatalysis and medical applications. They are usually obtained in reductive environment as molecular O  2  can oxidize Ru(II) to Ru(III) and Ru(IV).

Such Ru(II) site was obtained by reduction of &#8208;[bipy&#8208;Ru(III)Cl  4  ]  &#8208;  with simultaneous ligand exchange from Cl  &#8208;  to CO. This structural evolution was witnessed by a combination of  in situ  X&#8208;ray and infrared spectroscopy studies. The &#8208;[bipy&#8208;Ru(II)(CO)  2  Cl  2  ] site enables oxidation of CO with a turnover frequency of 0.73 &#215;&#160;10  &#8208;2  s  &#8208;1  at 462 K, while the Ru(III) site is completely inert. This work contributes to the studies of structure&#8208;activity relationship by demonstrating a practical control over both geometric and electronic structures of single&#8208;site catalysts at molecular level, which can be further applied in other single site catalyst researches.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Bromodomain and extra&#8208;terminal (BET) family proteins, BRD2&#8208;4 and T, are important drug targets; however, the biological functions of each bromodomain remain ill&#8208;defined. Chemical probes that selectively inhibit a single BET bromodomain are lacking, although pan inhibitors of the first (D1), and second (D2), bromodomain are known.

In competitive inhibition assays we show that our lead compound is 9&#8208;33 fold selective for BRD4 D1 over the other BET bromodomains. X&#8208;ray crystallography supports a role for the selectivity based on reorganization of a non&#8208;conserved lysine and displacement of an additional structured water&#160; in the BRD4 D1 binding site relative to our prior lead. Whereas pan&#8208;D1 inhibitors displace BRD4 from  MYC  enhancers, BRD4 D1 inhibition in MM.1S cells is insufficient for stopping Myc expression and may lead to its upregulation. Future analysis of BRD4 D1 gene regulation may shed light on differential BET bromodomain functions.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Here, we reported a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed Markovnikov&#8208;type hydroboration of terminal alkynes with HBpin to access  &#945;  &#8208;alkenyl boronates with good regioselectivity and atom economy. A new ligand has been developed for cobalt hydride catalyst which has been used for a unique Markovnikov selective insertion of terminal alkynes into metal hydride bond. This operationally simple protocol exhibits excellent functional group tolerance to deliver valuable alkene derivatives.</dc:description>

      <title>Relative Thermodynamic Stability of Diamond and Graphite</title>
      <dc:description>Recent density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations raised the possibility that diamond could be degenerate with graphite at very low temperatures. Through high&#8208;accuracy calorimetric experiments closing gaps in available data, we reinvestigate the relative thermodynamic stability of diamond and graphite. For  T  &lt; 400 K, graphite is always more stable than diamond at ambient pressure. At low temperatures, the stability is enthalpically driven, and entropy terms add to the stability at higher temperatures. We also carried out DFT calculations: B86bPBE&#8208;25X&#8208;XDM//B86bPBE&#8208;XDM and PBE0&#8208;XDM//PBE&#8208;XDM results overlap with the experimental &#8208;  T  &#916;  S  results and bracket the experimental values of &#916;  H  and &#916;  G  , displaced by only about 2&#215; the experimental uncertainty.

      <title>Reductive Hexamerization of CO Involving Cooperativity Between Magnesium(I) Reductants and [Mo(CO)6]: Synthesis of Well&#8208;Defined Magnesium Benzenehexolate Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>Reactions of two magnesium(I) compounds, [{(ArNacnac)Mg}2] (ArNacnac = [HC(MeCNAr)2]&#8208;Ar = mesityl (Mes) or o&#8208;xylyl (Xyl)), with CO in the presence of [Mo(CO)6] lead to the reductive hexamerization of CO, and formation of magnesium benzenehexolate complexes, [{(ArNacnac)Mg}6(C6O6)]. [Mo(CO)6] is not consumed in these reactions, but is apparently required to initiate (or catalyze) the CO hexamerizations. A range of synthetic, spectroscopic and computational studies have been used to probe the mechanism of formation of the benzenehexolate complexes. The magnesium(I) reductive hexamerizations of CO are closely related to Liebig&#8217;s reduction of CO with molten potassium (to give K6C6O6, amongst other products), originally reported in 1834. As the mechanism of that reaction is still unknown, it seems reasonable that magnesium(I) reductions of CO could prove useful homogeneous models for its elucidation, and for the study of other C&#8208;C bond forming reactions that use CO as a C1 feedstock (e.g. the Fischer&#8208;Tropsch process).</dc:description>

      <title>High Ammonia Uptake of a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Adsorbent in a Wide Pressure Range</title>
      <dc:description>Although numerous porous adsorbents have been investigated for NH  3  &#160;capture applications, these materials often exhibit insufficient NH  3  uptake, low NH  3  affinity at the ppm level, and poor chemical stability against wet NH  3  conditions. Herein, we report the NH  3  capture properties of M  2  (dobpdc) complexes (M = Mg  2+  , Mn  2+  , Co  2+  , Ni  2+  , and Zn  2+  ; dobpdc  4&#8722;  = 4,4&#8208;dioxidobiphenyl&#8208;3,3&#8208;dicarboxylate) that contain open metal sites. The NH  3  uptake of Mg  2  (dobpdc) at 298 K was 23.9 mmol g  &#8722;1  at 1 bar and 8.25 mmol g  &#8722;1  at 570 ppm, which are record high capacities at both pressures among existing porous adsorbents. The strength of the interactions between the Lewis acid open metal sites and NH  3  followed the trend of Ni &gt; Mg &gt; Co &gt; Mn, which was determined by NH  3  &#8208;temperature programmed desorption curves. The structural stability of Mg  2  (dobpdc) upon exposure to wet NH  3  was superior to that of the other M  2  (dobpdc) and the frameworks tested. Our van der Waals&#8208;corrected density functional theory calculations predicted that this may be associated with the higher stability of MgO  6  coordination compared to that of Mg(NH  3  )  6  . Overall, these results demonstrate that Mg  2  (dobpdc) is a recyclable compound that exhibits significant NH  3  affinity and capacity, making it a promising candidate for real&#8208;world NH  3  &#8208;capture applications.</dc:description>

Based on the bright  THPP  , imaging with high frame rate (34 frames per second) in a deep &#8216;valid penetration depth&#8217; up to 6 mm can be achieved. This enabled simultaneously and dynamically imaging of vasculatures and deeply located visceral.

Herein, we prove that such a dilemma can be well&#8208;addressed by deploying ZnCl  2  based electrolytes. Combining experimental studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, for the first time, we demonstrate an intriguing chloride ion (Cl  &#8208;  ) facilitated desolvation mechanism in hydrated [ZnCl]  +  (H  2  O)  n&#8208;1  (with n=1&#8208;6) clusters. Based on this mechanism, a &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; type hydrogel electrolyte filled with ZnCl  2  was developed to concurrently improve the energy storage capacity of porous carbon materials and the reversibility of Zn metal electrode. The resulting ZIHCs deliver a battery&#8208;level energy density up to 217 Wh kg  &#8208;1  at a power density of 450 W kg  &#8208;1  , an unprecedented cycling life of 100,000 cycles, together with excellent low&#8208;temperature adaptability and mechanical flexibility.</dc:description>
