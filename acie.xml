         <title>Exovinylene Cyclic Carbonates: Multifaceted CO2&#8208;Based Building Blocks for Modern Chemistry and Polymer Science</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dioxide is a renewable, inexhaustible and cheap alternative to fossil resources for the production of fine chemicals and plastics. This waste can notably be converted into exovinylene cyclic carbonates, unique synthons gaining momentum for preparing an impressive range of important organic molecules and functional polymers following 100% atom economy reactions under mild operating conditions in most cases. This review is summarizing the recent advances made in their synthesis with a particular attention to describe the catalysts needed for their preparation, and discuss the unique reactivity of these CO  2  &#8208;based heterocycles for constructing diverse organic building blocks and (functional) polymers. We also discuss the challenges and the future perspectives in the field.</dc:description>

         <title>Allosteric Binding&#8208;Induced Intramolecular Mechanical&#8208;Strain Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Analogous to allosteric enzymes, guest binding introduces a directional pulling or pushing force that acts on the reverse side of a Zn salen complex. This tunable intramolecular force promotes various degrees of conformational and torsional strain, as predicted by both classical conformational analysis and DFT. This strain energy can be further applied to cleave chemical bonds, and the efficiency can be tuned by the identity of allosteric guest.







Abstract
Recently, polymer mechanochemistry has attracted much scientific interest due to its potential to develop degradable polymers. When the two ends of a polymer chain experience a linear pulling stress, molecular strain builds up, at sufficiently strong force, a bond scission of the weakest covalent bond results. In contrast, bond&#8208;breaking events triggered by conformational stress are much less explored. Here, we discovered that a Zn salen complex would undergo conformational switching upon allosteric complexation with alkanediammonium guests. By controlling the guest chain length, the torsional strain experienced by Zn complex can be modulated to induce bond cleavage with chemical stimulus, and reactivity trend is predicted by conformational analysis derived by DFT calculation. Such strain&#8208;release reactivity by a Zn(salen) complex initiated by guest binding is reminiscent of conformation&#8208;induced reactivity of enzymes to enable chemical events that are otherwise inhibited.

         <title>Well&#8208;Controlled Living Polymerization of N&#8208;Propargylamides and Their Derivatives by Rhodium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heptaaryl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;hexatrienylrhodium(I) complexes induce well&#8208;controlled polymerization of N&#8208;propargylamides and their derivatives in the presence of PPh3, and the obtained polymers have high cis&#8208;stereoregularity and a narrow molecular weight distribution. The living nature enables control of molecular weights of the polymers and functionalization of both polymer chain ends, and synthesis of novel block copolymers is also demonstrated.







Abstract
A substantially improved method for living polymerization of N&#8208;propargylamides and their derivatives has been developed. Rhodium(I) complexes bearing an aryl&#8208;substituted 1,3,5&#8208;hexatriene chain can work as excellent initiators of the polymerization of such non&#8208;conjugated terminal alkynes to give the corresponding cis&#8208;stereoregular polymers having a narrow molecular weight distribution. The typical living nature has been confirmed by investigating the effects of initial feed ratios of the monomer to the initiator on the molecular weight of the resulting polymers as well as multistage polymerization. Moreover, we demonstrated that the present method enables functionalization of both polymer chain ends and synthesis of novel block copolymers consisting of poly(N&#8208;propargylamide) and poly(phenylacetylene) blocks with a narrow molecular weight distribution.

         <title>In Situ Constructed Nano&#8208;Drug Depots through Intracellular Hydrolytic Condensation for Chemotherapy of Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intracellular hydrolytic condensation (IHC) system to construct long&#8208;term retentive nano&#8208;drug depots in situ is presented. Based on silicon particles, the nano&#8208;drug depots are capable of sustained drug release, which results in highly efficient suppression of bladder cancer.







Abstract
Intravesical administration of first&#8208;line drugs has shown failure in the treatment of bladder cancer owing to the poor tumor retention time of chemotherapeutics. Herein, we report an intracellular hydrolytic condensation (IHC) system to construct long&#8208;term retentive nano&#8208;drug depots in situ, wherein sustained drug release results in highly efficient suppression of bladder cancer. Briefly, the designed doxorubicin (Dox)&#8208;silane conjugates self&#8208;assemble into silane&#8208;based prodrug nanoparticles, which condense into silicon particle&#8208;based nano&#8208;drug depots inside tumor cells. Significantly, we demonstrate that the IHC system possesses highly potent antitumor efficacy, which leads to the regression and eradication of large established tumors and simultaneously extends the overall survival of air pouch bladder cancer mice compared with that of mice treated with Dox. The concept of intracellular hydrolytic condensation can be extended via conjugating other chemotherapeutic drugs, which may facilitate rational design of novel nanomedicines for augmentation of chemotherapy.

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Doped Highly Graphitic Carbon Urchin&#8208;Like Hollow Structures Loaded with Single&#8208;Ni Atoms towards Efficient CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow porous urchin&#8208;like N&#8208;doped carbon structures with abundant accessible single&#8208;Ni sites (Ni&#8208;NC(HPU)) are fabricated by a novel Ni&#8208;catalyzed and Ni&#8208;templated strategy. The unique hollow thorns on the surface, high accessible surface area and good conductivity enable effective electron/mass transfer and afford numerous singe&#8208;Ni sites towards highly efficient CO2 electroreduction.







Abstract
The rational design of single&#8208;atom catalysts featuring excellent conductivity, highly accessible discrete active sites and favorable mass transfer is crucial for electrocatalysis but remains challenging. In this study, a reliable Ni&#8208;catalyzed and Ni&#8208;templated strategy is developed to synthesize a single&#8208;atom catalyst by transforming metallic Ni into single&#8208;Ni atoms anchored on hollow porous urchin&#8208;like (HPU) N&#8208;doped carbon (NC) (designated as Ni&#8208;NC(HPU)), which possesses high crystallinity and sufficient Ni&#8208;N4 moiety (2.4&#8197;wt&#8201;%). The unique hollow thorns on the surface, good conductivity and large external surface area facilitate electron/mass transfer and exposure of single&#8208;Ni sites. As a result, the Ni&#8208;NC(HPU) catalyst exhibits remarkable activity and high stability for CO2 electroreduction. Moreover, this synthetic strategy can also be facilely extended to prepare distinct hollow porous architectures with similar components, such as the wire&#8208; and sphere&#8208;like ones.

         <title>Catalytic Substrate&#8208;Selective Silylation of Primary Alcohols via Remote Functional&#8208;Group Discrimination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise molecular recognition of the substrate structure by catalyst 3 enabled substrate&#8208;selective silylation of long&#8208;chain primary alcohols. Silylation of A proceeded 11 times faster than that of B by recognition of a one&#8208;carbon difference between primary alcohols A and B. Preferential silylation of A took place over that of C by a factor of 21 owing to discrimination of the remote functionality at C(5) from the reacting OH group at C(1).







Abstract
Silylation of alcohols has generally been known to take place at the sterically most accessible less&#8208;hindered hydroxy group. Herein, the catalyst&#8208;controlled substrate&#8208;selective silylation of primary alcohols, in which the selectivity was controlled independently of the innate reactivity of the hydroxy group, based on the steric environment, is reported. The chain&#8208;length&#8208;selective silylation of 1,n&#8208;amino alcohol derivatives was achieved and 1,5&#8208;amino alcohol derivatives showed outstandingly high reactivity in the presence of analogues with a shorter or longer chain length under catalyst&#8208;controlled conditions. A highly substrate&#8208;selective catalytic silylation of pentanol analogues was also developed, in which the remote functionality at C(5) from the reacting hydroxy groups was effectively discriminated on silylation.

         <title>Asymmetric Catalytic (2+1) Cycloaddition of Thioketones to Synthesize Tetrasubstituted Thiiranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of catalytic enantioselective (2+1) cycloaddition of &#945;&#8208;diazo pyrazoleamides with thioketones is presented, catalyzed by chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/Co&#921;&#921; complexes. This method provides a rapid and facile access to a series of optically active tetrasubstituted thiiranes with good outcomes (up to 99&#8201;% yield, 97&#8201;% ee). The origin of stereoselectivity was well elucidated by DFT calculations.







Abstract
Herein, we report the first example of enantioselective (2+1) cycloaddition of thioketones with &#945;&#8208;diazo pyrazoleamides for the direct synthesis of tetrasubstituted thiiranes. In the presence of chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/cobalt(&#921;&#921;) complexes (2&#8211;5&#8197;mol%), excellent efficiency (up to 99&#8201;% yield within 15&#8197;mins) and high stereoselectivity (up to &gt;19&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and 97&#8201;% ee) are available. Elaborations of thiiranes via desulfuration have also been conducted to deliver tetrasubstituted olefins. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the reaction initiates from a doublet state cobalt(&#921;&#921;) carbenoid, which is followed by a quartet cobalt(&#921;&#921;)&#8208;bound thiocarbonyl ylide pathway. This work provides a route for the selective construction of tetrasubstituted thiiranes and olefins that are otherwise difficult to access.

         <title>Deep Downregulation of PD&#8208;L1 by Caged Peptide&#8208;Conjugated AIEgen/miR&#8208;140 Nanoparticles for Enhanced Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In tumor cells, a caged peptide&#8208;AIEgen probe self&#8208;assembled with miR&#8208;140 could release the GO203 peptide binding to MUC1 and miR&#8208;140 degrading the PD&#8208;L1 mRNA, thus, achieving the deep downregulation the of PD&#8208;L1 expression. Subsequently, activated immune cells by PDT&#8208;induced release of TAAs would achieve more effective immunotherapy.







Abstract
Downregulating programmed cell death ligand 1(PD&#8208;L1) protein levels in tumor cells is an effective way to achieve immune system activation for oncology treatment, but current strategies are inadequate. Here, we design a caged peptide&#8208;AIEgen probe (GCP) to self&#8208;assemble with miR&#8208;140 forming GCP/miR&#8208;140 nanoparticles. After entering tumor cells, GCP/miR&#8208;140 disassembles in the presence of Cathepsin B (CB) and releases caged GO203 peptide, miR&#8208;140 and PyTPA. Peptide decages in the highly reductive intracellular environment and binds to mucin 1 (MUC1), thereby downregulating the expression of PD&#8208;L1. Meanwhile, miR&#8208;140 reduces PD&#8208;L1 expression by targeting downregulation of PD&#8208;L1 mRNA. Under the action of PyTPA&#8208;mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT), tumor&#8208;associated antigens are released, triggering immune cell attack on tumor cells. This multiple mechanism&#8208;based strategy of deeply downregulating PD&#8208;L1 in tumor cells activates the immune system and thus achieves effective immunotherapy.

         <title>A Desaturative Approach for Aromatic Aldehyde Synthesis via Synergistic Enamine, Photoredox and Cobalt Triple Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic enamine, photoredox and cobalt triple catalysis enables a desaturative approach for the preparation of aromatic aldehydes.







Abstract
Aromatic aldehydes are fundamental intermediates that are widely utilised for the synthesis of important materials across the broad spectrum of chemical industries. Accessing highly substituted derivatives can often be difficult as their functionalizations are generally performed via electrophilic aromatic substitution, SEAr. Here we provide an alternative and mechanistically distinct approach whereby aromatic aldehydes are assembled from saturated precursors via a desaturative process. This novel strategy harnesses the high&#8208;fidelity of Diels&#8211;Alder cycloadditions to quickly construct multi&#8208;substituted cyclohexenecarbaldehyde cores which undergo desaturation via the synergistic interplay of enamine, photoredox and cobalt triple catalysis.

         <dc:description>
An anisotropic&#8208;kinetics transformation strategy is developed to synthesize single&#8208;crystalline hierarchical ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites with highly open nanoarchitectures and different compositions. The as&#8208;prepared ZSM&#8208;5 nanocages exhibit remarkably improved catalytic lifetime and reduced coke formation rate in the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons reaction.







Abstract
We report an anisotropic&#8208;kinetics transformation strategy to prepare single&#8208;crystalline aluminosilicate MFI zeolites (ZSM&#8208;5) with highly open nanoarchitectures and hierarchical porosities. The methodology relies on the cooperative effect of in situ etching and recrystallization on the evolution of pure&#8208;silica MFI zeolite (silicalite&#8208;1) nanotemplates under hydrothermal conditions. The strategy enables a controllable preparation of ZSM&#8208;5 nanostructures with diverse open geometries by tuning the relative rate difference between etching and recrystallization processes. Meanwhile, it can also be extended to synthesize other heteroatom&#8208;substituted MFI zeolite nanocages. Compared with conventional ZSM&#8208;5 microcrystals, nanocrystals, and nanoboxes, the ZSM&#8208;5 nanocages with single&#8208;crystalline nature, highly open nanoarchitectures, and hierarchical porosities exhibit remarkably enhanced catalytic lifetime and low coking rate in the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons (MTH) reaction.

         <title>Tailoring a Nanochaperone to Regulate &#945;&#8208;Synuclein Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanochaperone for &#945;&#8208;synuclein was designed and fabricated to prevent the misassembly of &#945;&#8208;synuclein. The nanochaperone, termed &#945;S&#8208;nChap, dynamically and transiently captures monomeric &#945;&#8208;synuclein and inhibits its oligomerization. Moreover, &#945;S&#8208;nChap tightly captures oligomeric &#945;&#8208;synuclein and inhibits its fibrillization.







Abstract
Protein misassembly leads to the formation of dysfunctional and toxic molecular species relating to neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Here, we tailored a nanochaperone (&#945;S&#8208;nChap) for &#945;&#8208;synuclein to regulate its assembly. The &#945;S&#8208;nChap is capable of i)&#8197;specifically recognizing &#945;&#8208;synuclein; ii)&#8197;dynamically capturing and stabilizing monomeric &#945;&#8208;synuclein and retarding oligomerization; iii)&#8197;tightly capturing oligomeric &#945;&#8208;synuclein to prevent fibrillization; and iv)&#8197;transporting &#945;&#8208;synuclein oligomers to the lysosomal degradation system. The regulation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein assembly by &#945;S&#8208;nChap was studied in vitro. Moreover, the role of &#945;S&#8208;nChap preventing &#945;&#8208;synuclein pathology in cells and protecting neurons from apoptosis was investigated. The strategy of tailoring a nanochaperone to regulate aberrant assembly of pathogenic proteins provides important insights into protein misfolding diseases. We foresee that &#945;S&#8208;nChap has therapeutic value for Parkinson's disease.

         <title>Expressed Protein Selenoester Ligation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An expressed protein selenoester ligation (EPSL) methodology that enables the efficient semi&#8208;synthesis of site&#8208;specifically modified proteins at high dilution is described. EPSL involves the one&#8208;pot conversion of protein acyl hydrazides (derived from recombinant intein fusion precursors) to protein aryl selenoesters, followed by ligation with synthetic modified selenopeptides and chemoselective deselenization.







Abstract
Herein, we describe the development and application of a novel expressed protein selenoester ligation (EPSL) methodology for the one&#8208;pot semi&#8208;synthesis of modified proteins. EPSL harnesses the rapid kinetics of ligation reactions between modified synthetic selenopeptides and protein aryl selenoesters (generated from expressed intein fusion precursors) followed by in situ chemoselective deselenization to afford target proteins at concentrations that preclude the use of traditional ligation methods. The utility of the EPSL technology is showcased through the efficient semi&#8208;synthesis of ubiquitinated polypeptides, lipidated analogues of the membrane&#8208;associated GTPase YPT6, and site&#8208;specifically phosphorylated variants of the oligomeric chaperone protein Hsp27 at high dilution.

         <title>Ionothermal Synthesis of Covalent Triazine Frameworks in a NaCl&#8208;KCl&#8208;ZnCl2 Eutectic Salt for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent triazine&#8208;based frameworks with ordered molecular structures were synthesized in a ternary NaCl&#8208;KCl&#8208;ZnCl2 eutectic salt system at 200&#8201;&#176;C to produce photocatalysts for hydrogen production.







Abstract
Covalent triazine&#8208;based frameworks (CTFs) are typically produced by the salt&#8208;melt polycondensation of aromatic nitriles in the presence of ZnCl2. In this reaction, molten ZnCl2 salt acts as both a solvent and Lewis acid catalyst. However, when cyclotrimerization takes place at temperatures above 300&#8201;&#176;C, undesired carbonization occurs. In this study, an ionothermal synthesis method for CTF&#8208;based photocatalysts was developed using a ternary NaCl&#8208;KCl&#8208;ZnCl2 eutectic salt (ES) mixture with a melting point of approximately 200&#8201;&#176;C. This temperature is lower than the melting point of pure ZnCl2 (318&#8201;&#176;C), thus providing milder salt&#8208;melt conditions. These conditions facilitated the polycondensation process, while avoiding carbonization of the polymeric backbone. The resulting CTF&#8208;ES200 exhibited enhanced optical and electronic properties, and displayed remarkable photocatalytic performance in the hydrogen evolution reaction.

         <dc:description>
A PdII&#8208;catalyzed tertiary C&#8722;H activation of cyclobutylmethyl ketones using a transient directing group is reported. An electron&#8208;deficient 2&#8208;pyridone ligand was identified an external ligand to enable tertiary C&#8722;H activation. A variety of cyclobutylmethyl ketones bearing quaternary carbon centers was readily accessed in up to 81&#8201;% yield and &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 regioisomeric ratios of tertiary C&#8722;H arylation to &#946;&#8208;methylene (&#946;&#8208;methyl) or &#947;&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation.







Abstract
We report the first example of selective PdII&#8208;catalyzed tertiary C&#8722;H activation of cyclobutylmethyl ketones using a transient directing group. An electron&#8208;deficient 2&#8208;pyridone ligand was identified as the optimal external ligand to enable tertiary C&#8722;H activation. A variety of cyclobutylmethyl ketones bearing quaternary carbon centers was readily accessed without preinstalling internal directing groups in up to 81&#8201;% yield and &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 regioisomeric ratios of tertiary C&#8722;H arylation to &#946;&#8208;methylene (&#946;&#8208;methyl) or &#947;&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation.

         <title>Directing Multivalent Aptamer&#8208;Receptor Binding on the Cell Surface with Programmable Atom&#8208;Like Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA framework&#8208;based programmable atom&#8208;like nanoparticles (aptPANs) and their assemblies with fixed aptamer copy numbers but different directionality were designed. These are employed to direct multivalent aptamer&#8211;receptor binding on the cell membrane interface. The directional&#8208;yet&#8208;flexible aptPAN molecules exhibit the adaptability to the receptor distribution on cell surfaces and thus high affinity against target tumor cells.







Abstract
Multivalent interactions of biomolecules play pivotal roles in physiological and pathological settings. Whereas the directionality of the interactions is crucial, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthetic multivalent ligand&#8211;receptor systems generally lack programmable approaches for orthogonal directionality. Here, we report the design of programmable atom&#8208;like nanoparticles (aptPANs) to direct multivalent aptamer&#8211;receptor binding on the cell interface. The positions of the aptamer motifs can be prescribed on tetrahedral DNA frameworks to realize atom&#8208;like orthogonal valence and direction, enabling the construction of multivalent molecules with fixed aptamer copy numbers but different directionality. These directional&#8208;yet&#8208;flexible aptPAN molecules exhibit the adaptability to the receptor distribution on cell surfaces. We demonstrate the high&#8208;affinity tumor cell binding with a linear aptPAN oligomer (&#8776;13&#8208;fold improved compared to free aptamers), which leads to &#8776;50&#8201;% suppression of cell growth.

         <title>Electrode&#8211;Electrolyte Interfacial Chemistry Modulation for Ultra&#8208;High Rate Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a THF&#8208;based electrolyte with a weak solvation structure, Na+ desolvation is fast and a uniform solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with abundant NaF and organic compounds is generated on the commercial hard carbon anode. This greatly enhances the interface stability and enables the rapid migration of Na+ in the SEI, thus realizing the high rate capability, long&#8208;term stability and good low&#8208;temperature performance for the hard carbon anode.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries capable of operating at rate and temperature extremes are highly desirable, but elusive due to the dynamics and thermodynamics limitations. Herein, a strategy of electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfacial chemistry modulation is proposed. The commercial hard carbon demonstrates superior rate performance with 212&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at an ultra&#8208;high current density of 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 in the electrolyte with weak ion solvation/desolvation, which is much higher than those in common electrolytes (nearly no capacity in carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes). Even at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, a high capacity of 175&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (74&#8201;% of its room&#8208;temperature capacity) can be maintained at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Such an electrode retains 90&#8201;% of its initial capacity after 1000 cycles. As proven, weak ion solvation/desolvation of tetrahydrofuran greatly facilitates fast&#8208;ion diffusion at the SEI/electrolyte interface and homogeneous SEI with well&#8208;distributed NaF and organic components ensures fast Na+ diffusion through the SEI layer and a stable interface.

         <title>MOF&#8208;Hosted Enzymes for Continuous Flow Catalysis in Aqueous and Organic Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A continuous flow enzyme reactor was developed using a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) to immobilize the enzyme. The MOF NU&#8208;1000 was inserted into a HPLC column and loaded with esterase without any modification of the MOF or the enzyme. A high space&#8208;time yield of 1432&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 was achieved, and the stability of the immobilized enzyme was enhanced to about 30 times that of the free enzyme.







Abstract
Fully exploiting the potential of enzymes in cell&#8208;free biocatalysis requires stabilization of the catalytically active proteins and their integration into efficient reactor systems. Although in recent years initial steps towards the immobilization of such biomolecules in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been taken, these demonstrations have been limited to batch experiments and to aqueous conditions. Here we demonstrate a MOF&#8208;based continuous flow enzyme reactor system, with high productivity and stability, which is also suitable for organic solvents. Under aqueous conditions, the stability of the enzyme was increased 30&#8208;fold, and the space&#8211;time yield exceeded that obtained with other enzyme immobilization strategies by an order of magnitude. Importantly, the infiltration of the proteins into the MOF did not require additional functionalization, thus allowing for time&#8208; and cost&#8208;efficient fabrication of the biocatalysts using label&#8208;free enzymes.

         <title>Profiling of the ADP&#8208;Ribosylome in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For further studies on protein ADP&#8208;ribosylation, two new NAD+ derivatives are introduced, which carry either a fluorophore or an affinity tag. In combination with developed methods for their mild cell delivery, studies of ADP&#8208;ribosylation in living human cells were conducted. This approach allows not only the imaging of ADP&#8208;ribosylation in living cells but also the proteome&#8208;wide analysis of cellular adaptation by protein ADP&#8208;ribosylation as a consequence of environmental changes.







Abstract
Post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) with ADP&#8208;ribose and poly(ADP&#8208;ribose) using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) as substrate is involved in the regulation of numerous cellular pathways in eukaryotes, notably the response to DNA damage caused by cellular stress. Nevertheless, due to intrinsic properties of NAD+ e.g., high polarity and associated poor cell passage, these PTMs are difficult to characterize in cells. Here, two new NAD+ derivatives are presented, which carry either a fluorophore or an affinity tag and, in combination with developed methods for mild cell delivery, allow studies in living human cells. We show that this approach allows not only the imaging of ADP&#8208;ribosylation in living cells but also the proteome&#8208;wide analysis of cellular adaptation by protein ADP&#8208;ribosylation as a consequence of environmental changes such as H2O2&#8208;induced oxidative stress or the effect of the approved anti&#8208;cancer drug olaparib. Our results therefore pave the way for further functional and clinical studies of the ADP&#8208;ribosylated proteome in living cells in health and disease.

         <title>Haptotropism in a Nickel Complex with a Neutral, &#960;&#8208;Bridging cyclo&#8208;P4 Ligand Analogous to Cyclobutadiene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solvent&#8208;dependent reaction of white phosphorus with a Ni0 reagent incorporating a chelating bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) leads to complexes with neutral P2 and P4 ligands. The latter mirrors the coordination of cyclobutadiene to Ni0, displaying olefin&#8208;like bonding and &#951;2&#8208;&#951;4&#8208;haptotropism, and can be converted to the former. These findings emphasize the fluidity of cyclo&#8208;P4 coordination modes.







Abstract
Dedicated to Professor Manfred Scheer on the occasion of his 65th birthday
The reaction of (1)Ni(&#951;2&#8208;cod), 2, incorporating a chelating bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) 1, with P4 in pentane yielded the dinuclear complex [(2)Ni]2(&#956;2,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;P4), 3, formally featuring a cyclobutadiene&#8208;like, neutral, rectangular, &#960;&#8208;bridging P4&#8208;ring. In toluene, the butterfly&#8208;shaped complex [(1)Ni]2(&#956;2,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;P2), 4, with a formally neutral P2&#8208;unit was obtained from 2 and either P4 or 3. Computational studies showed that a haptotropic rearrangement involving two isomers of the &#956;2,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;P4 coordination mode and a low&#8208;energy &#956;2,&#951;4&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;4&#8208;P4 coordination mode, as previously predicted for related nickel cyclobutadiene complexes, could explain the coalescence observed in the low&#8208;temperature NMR spectra of 3. The insertion of the (1)Ni fragment into a P&#8722;P bond of P7(SiMe3)3, forming complex 5 with a norbornane&#8208;like P7 ligand, was also observed.

         <title>Mechanochemical Access to a Short&#8208;Lived Cyclic Dimer Pd2L2: An Elusive Kinetic Species En Route to Molecular Triangle Pd3L3 and Molecular Square Pd4L4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions between cis&#8208;protected Pd ions and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine, a classic self&#8208;assembly reaction studied for the past 30&#8197;years, would always give molecular square Pd4L4 and/or triangle Pd3L3. By solvent&#8208;free ball&#8208;milling, a highly&#8208;reactive cyclic dimer Pd2L2 is isolated for the first time as the major species, highlighting that unique chemical space mechanochemistry can provide an environment to stabilize species that are otherwise too reactive to both &#8220;see&#8221; and &#8220;capture&#8221;.







Abstract
Pd&#8208;based molecular square Pd4L4 and triangle Pd3L3 represent the molecular ancestors of metal&#8208;coordination polyhedra that have been an integral part of the field for the last 30&#8197;years. Conventional solution&#8208;based reactions between cis&#8208;protected Pd ions and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine exclusively give Pd4L4 and/or Pd3L3 as the sole products. We herein show that, under solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical conditions, the self&#8208;assembly energy landscape can be thermodynamically manipulated to form an elusive cyclic dimer Pd2L2 for the first time. In the absence of solvent, Pd2L2 is indefinitely stable in the solid&#8208;state, but converts rapidly to its thermodynamic products Pd3L3 and Pd4L4 in solution, confirming Pd2L2 as a short&#8208;lived kinetic species in the solution&#8208;based self&#8208;assembly process. Our results highlight how mechanochemistry grants access to a vastly different chemical space than available under conventional solution conditions. This provides a unique opportunity to isolate elusive species in self&#8208;assembly processes that are too reactive to both &#8220;see&#8221; and &#8220;capture&#8221;.

         <title>Sr3[SnOSe3][CO3]: A Heteroanionic Nonlinear Optical Material Containing Planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated [CO3] and Heteroleptic [SnOSe3] Anionic Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The inorganic heteroanionic materials are attracting increasing attention for exploring new nonlinear optical (NLO) materials because they could better satisfy the necessary but conflicting properties of NLO crystals,  e.g.  large SHG response and wide band&#8208;gap. Up to now, the reports on heteroanionic NLO materials are mainly focused on ultraviolet or visible oxide&#8208;based fluoroborates, fluorophosphates, borate&#8208;phosphates and borate&#8208;iodates. However, the chalcogenide containing different kinds of anionic groups is barely reported. Herein, we have synthesized the first oxychalcogenide&#8208;carbonate, Sr3[SnOSe3][CO3] that contains two different kinds of anionic groups, [SnOSe3] and [CO3]. It crystallizes in noncentrosymmetric space group and exhibits fascinating NLO properties, including large SHG response (~1&#215;AGS), sufficient birefringence (0.12 @1064 nm), wide band&#8208;gap (3.46 eV) and high laser damage threshold (240 MW/cm2). These make Sr3[SnOSe3][CO3]  &#160;a promising NLO crystal.</dc:description>

         <title>Dissection of Light&#8208;Induced Charge Accumulation at a Highly Active Iron Porphyrin: Insights in the Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unravelling the mechanism&#160;of charge accumulation and utilization in the light&#8208;driven carbon dioxide reduction using iron porphyrins bearing hydrogen bonding scaffolds revealed unprecedented puzzle pieces about its rate limiting step. While the formal Fe(0) redox state has been widely accepted as the catalytically active species, Zakaria Halime, Ally Aukauloo et&#8197;al. show in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202117530) that the Fe(I) species is already involved in the substrate activation of the photocatalytic cycle.

         <title>Iodine&#8208;Catalysed Dissolution of Elemental Gold in Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold is a valuable metal that can be dissolved with common household chemicals as reported by Timo Repo&#160;et&#8197;al.&#160;in their Research Article (e202117587). By applying catalytic iodine, aqueous hydrogen peroxide and 2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazol, gold promptly dissolves in ethanol. Catalytic reactions and environmentally benign solvents and reagents are the basis for sustainable development and a gateway to greener future of precious metals recycling.

         <title>Accelerated Mechanochemistry in Helical Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solution polymer mechanochemistry is well understood in random coil morphology. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202115325), Charles&#8197;E. Diesendruck and Hang Zhang assess covalent mechanochemistry when &#945;&#8208;helices are present in covalent macromolecules. Poly&#8208;&#947;&#8208;benzyl&#8208;glutamate (PBG) with different helicities are prepared by tuning the enantiomeric excess of the feed monomer. Ultrasonication is used to induce solvodynamic shear, leading to the scission of the polymer into smaller helixes.

         <title>Circularly Polarized White Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Spiro&#8208;type Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we report the first all thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials based circularly polarized white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;WOLEDs). Two pairs of spiro&#8208;type TADF enantiomers, (R/S)&#8208;SPOCN (5,5'&#8208;((2,2',3,3'&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;1,1'&#8208;spirobi [indene]&#8208;7,7'&#8208;diyl)bis(oxy))bis (4&#8208;(10H&#8208;phenoxazin&#8208;10&#8208;yl)phthalonitrile)) and (R/S)&#8208;OSFSO (2'&#8208;(trifluoromethyl) spiro[quinolino [3,2,1&#8208;kl]phenoxazine&#8208;9,9'&#8208;thioxanthene]&#8208;10',10'&#8208;dioxide), serve as emitters with complementary emission. The CP&#8208;OLEDs exhibit warm white emission with CIE coordinate of (0.35, 0.46). Besides, decent device performances are observed with external quantum efficiency up to 21.6% at maximum&#160;and 11.8% at 1000 cd/m2. Obvious circularly polarized electroluminescence signals are detected with dissymmetry factor |gEL| around 3.0 &#215; 10&#8208;3. This is the the first report of CP&#8208;WOLEDs that can harvest both of singlet and triplet excitons, which provides a feasible strategy to develop CP&#8208;WOLEDs with remarkable device performances.</dc:description>

         <title>Charge&#8208;Transfer Cocrystal via a Persistent Radical Cation Acceptor for Efficient Solar&#8208;Thermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing organic charge&#8208;transfer (CT) cocrystals for efficient solar&#8208;thermal conversion is a long&#8208;sought goal but remains challenging. Here we construct a unique CT cocrystal by using persistent 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azino&#8208;bis (3 ethylbenzothiazoline&#8208;6&#8208;sulfonic acid) radical cation (ABTS  +&#8226;  ) as the electron acceptor. The strong persistency and electron affinity of ABTS  +&#8226;  endow a high degree of electron delocalization between ABTS  +&#8226;  and 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine donor. Together with the intrinsic long&#8208;wavelength absorption of ABTS  +&#8226;  , the synthesized cocrystal can effectively capture the full solar spectrum and show distinguished photothermal efficiency. Such cocrystal is further used for solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation, and a high evaporation rate of 1.407 kg m  &#8208;2  h  &#8208;1  and a remarkable solar&#8208;to&#8208;vapor efficiency of 97.0% have been achieved upon 1 sun irradiation. This work indicates the enormous prospects for charge transfer&#8208;based functional materials through rational radical cations engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantiomeric Water&#8208;Soluble Octopus[3]arenes for Highly Enantioselective Recognition of Chiral Ammonium Salts in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Study of enantioselective recognition in water by synthetic chiral macrocyclic receptors is undoubtedly of theoretical and practical significance, but it is a big challenge to achieve the enantioselective recognition with both high enantioselectivity and high affinity in water probably due to the deficiency of such water&#8208;soluble macrocyclic receptors with stable chiral cavities. Herein, we report a new class of chiral macrocyclic arenes named octopus[3]arenes. The enantiomeric macrocycles are composed of three homochiral ethenoanthracene subunits, and they can be synthesized by two pathways and then easily converted into water&#8208;soluble octopus[3]arenes  P  &#8208;  1  and  M  &#8208;  1  . Notably,  P  &#8208;  1  and  M  &#8208;  1  with the rigid hexagonal structures and stable chiral hydrophobic cavities exhibit highly enantioselective recognition towards three pairs of chiral ammonium salts in water with association constant up to 10  6  M  &#8208;1  and  S  /  R  selectivity high up to 12.89.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Allylboration of Alkynes with Allylic gem&#8208;Dichlorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allylic  gem  &#8208;dichlorides are shown to be efficient substrates for catalytic asymmetric allylboration of alkynes. The method employs a chiral NHC&#8208;Cu catalyst capable of generating in a single step chiral skipped dienes bearing a  Z  &#8208;alkenyl chloride, a trisubstituted  E  &#8208;alkenyl boronate and a bis&#8208;allylic stereocenter with excellent levels of chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. This high degree of functionalization makes these products versatile building blocks as illustrated with the synthesis of several optically active compounds. DFT calculations support the key presence of a metal cation bridge ligand&#8208;substrate interaction and account for the stereoselectivity outcome.</dc:description>

         <title>An Acid&#8208;regulated Self&#8208;blinking Fluorescent Probe for Resolving Whole&#8208;cell Lysosomes with Long&#8208;term Nanoscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Long&#8208;term super&#8208;resolution imaging appears to be increasingly important for unraveling organelle dynamics at the nanoscale, but is challenging due to the need for highly photostable and environment&#8208;sensitive fluorescent probes. Here, we report a self&#8208;blinking fluorophore that achieved 12 nm spatial resolution and 20 ms time resolution under acidic lysosomal conditions. This fluorophore was successfully applied in super&#8208;resolution imaging of lysosomal dynamics over 40 min. The pH dependence of the dye during blinking made the fluorophore sensitive to lysosomal pH. This probe enables simultaneous dynamic and pH recognition of all lysosomes in the entire cell at the single&#8208;lysosome&#8208;resolved level, which allowed us to resolve whole&#8208;cell lysosome subpopulations based on lysosomal distribution, size, and luminal pH. We also observed a variety of lysosome movement trajectories and different types of interactions modes between lysosomes.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Design Strategy Enabling the Synthesis of Hydrolysis&#8208;Resistant, Water&#8208;Stable Titanium(IV) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite its prevalence in the environment, the chemistry of the Ti  4+  ion has long been relegated to anhydrous solutions or hydrolyzed TiO  2  polymorphs. A knowledge gap in stabilizing molecular Ti  4+  species in aqueous environments has prevented the use of this ion for various applications such as cancer therapy, radioimaging, design of water&#8208;compatible metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), and aqueous&#8208;phase molecular catalysis applications. Herein, we demonstrate that a fragment&#8208;based screening approach of bidentate chelators with Ti  4+  in aqueous solution, as well as computational and structural analysis reliably predicts that a hexadentate analogues of catechol (benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diol) and deferiprone (3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;pyridone), TREN&#8208;CAM and THP  Me  respectively, form mononuclear Ti  4+  complexes resistant against hydrolysis from pH 4&#8208;10. We further validate our findings using radiochemical labeling with the short&#8208;lived isotopeTi&#8208;45, which demonstrates that the [  45  Ti]Ti&#8208;TREN&#8208;CAM complex remains inert against transchelation in vivo.</dc:description>

A knowledge gap in stabilizing molecular Ti  4+  species in aqueous environments has prevented the use of this ion for various applications such as cancer therapy, radioimaging, design of water-compatible metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), and aqueous-phase molecular catalysis applications. Herein, we demonstrate that a fragment-based screening approach of bidentate chelators with Ti  4+  in aqueous solution, as well as computational and structural analysis reliably predicts that a hexadentate analogues of catechol (benzene-1,2-diol) and deferiprone (3-hydroxy-1,2-dimethyl-4(1H)-pyridone), TREN-CAM and THP  Me  respectively, form mononuclear Ti  4+  complexes resistant against hydrolysis from pH 4-10. We further validate our findings using radiochemical labeling with the short-lived isotopeTi-45, which demonstrates that the [  45  Ti]Ti-TREN-CAM complex remains inert against transchelation in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Yttrium&#8208;Catalyzed ortho&#8208;Selective C&#8208;H Borylation of Pyridines with Pinacolborane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work reports a site&#8208;selective C&#8208;H borylation of pyridines at the  ortho&#8208;position with pinacolborane enabled by an yttrocene catalyst. The reaction provides a new family of 2&#8208;pyridyl boronates with a broad substrate scope and high atom efficiency. The resultant boronates were able to undergo a variety of transformations,  e.g., oxidation, Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling, Chan&#8208;Lam amination and etherification. Catalytic intermediates, including  ortho&#8208;C&#8208;H metalated and borylated complexes, were isolated from stoichiometric experiments and confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>New ligands for the iridium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8211;H borylation of aliphatic compounds were established. In sharp contrast to 6&#8208;methyl&#8208;2,2&#180;&#8208;bipyridine and 6&#8208;isobutyl&#8208;2,2&#180;&#8208;bipyridine, 2,2&#180;&#8209;bipyridine and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline derivatives bearing a hydrosilylmethyl group (which would give a thermally stable NNSi pincer complex) served as suitable ligands for the reaction. Among them, a phenanthroline&#8208;based NNSi pincer ligand was shown to be an excellent ligand, and various aliphatic compounds were efficiently converted to the corresponding borylated products using the Ir/NNSi pincer catalyst system. The NNSi pincer ligand showed unique selectivity and enabled the iridium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8211;H borylation using pinacolborane [H&#8211;B(pin)] instead of B2(pin)2. The formation of an iridium complex bearing a quinoline&#8208;based NNSi pincer ligand from [IrCl(cod)]2&#160;was observed, and the catalytic activity of the complex was demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Revisiting the Bonding Model for Gold(I) Species: The Importance of Pauli Repulsion Revealed in a Gold(I)&#8208;Cyclobutadiene Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the bonding of gold(I) species has been central to the development of gold (I) catalysis. Herein, we present the synthesis and single&#8208;crystal characterization of the first gold(I)&#8208;cyclobutadiene complex, accompanied with bonding analysis by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art energy decomposition analysis methods. Analysis of possible coordination modes for the new species not only confirms established characteristics of gold(I) bonding, but also suggests that Pauli repulsion is a key yet hitherto overlooked element. Additionally, we obtain a new perspective on gold(I)&#8208;bonding by comparison of the gold(I)&#8208;cyclobutadiene to congeners stabilized by p&#8208;, d&#8208;, and f&#8208;block metals. Consequently, we refine the gold(I) bonding model, with a delicate interplay of Pauli repulsion and charge transfer as the key driving force for various coordination motifs. Pauli repulsion is similarly determined as a significant interaction in gold(I)&#8208;alkyne species, corroborating this revised understanding of gold(I) bonding</dc:description>

         <title>Amorphous Boron Carbide on Titanium Dioxide Nanobelt Arrays for High&#8208;Efficiency Electrocatalytic NO Reduction to NH3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The a&#8208;B2.6C@TiO2/Ti acts as an efficient and stable 3D electrocatalyst for converting NO to NH3, exhibiting an NH3 yield of 3678.6&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a Faradaic efficiency of 87.6&#8201;%. An a&#8208;B2.6C@TiO2/Ti&#8208;based Zn&#8722;NO battery achieves both high power densities and NH3 yields. An in&#8208;depth understanding of catalytic mechanisms is gained by density functional theory calculations.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic NO reduction is regarded as an attractive strategy to degrade the NO contaminant into useful NH3, but the lack of efficient and stable electrocatalysts to facilitate such multiple proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer processes impedes its applications. Here, we report on developing amorphous B2.6C supported on a TiO2 nanoarray on a Ti plate (a&#8208;B2.6C@TiO2/Ti) as an NH3&#8208;producing nanocatalyst with appreciable activity and durability toward the NO electroreduction. It shows a yield of 3678.6&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a FE of 87.6&#8201;%, superior to TiO2/Ti (563.5&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 42.6&#8201;%) and a&#8208;B2.6C/Ti (2499.2&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 85.6&#8201;%). An a&#8208;B2.6C@TiO2/Ti&#8208;based Zn&#8722;NO battery achieves a power density of 1.7&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with an NH3 yield of 1125&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2. An in&#8208;depth understanding of catalytic mechanisms is gained by theoretical calculations.

An a-B&lt;sub&gt;2.6&lt;/sub&gt;C@TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Ti-based Zn&#8722;NO battery achieves a power density of 1.7&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with an NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield of 1125&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. An in-depth understanding of catalytic mechanisms is gained by theoretical calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Non&#8208;binary Encoded Nucleic Acid Barcodes Directly Readable by a Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A large collection of unique molecular barcodes is useful in the simultaneous sensing or screening of molecular analytes. Though the sequence of DNA has been widely applied to encode for molecular barcodes, decoding of these barcodes is normally assisted by sequencing. We here demonstrate a barcode system based solely on self&#8208;assembly of synthetic nucleic acids and direct nanopore decoding. Each molecular barcode is composed of &#8220;n&#8221; distinct information nodes in a non&#8208;binary manner and can be sequentially scanned and decoded by a Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A (MspA) nanopore. Nanopore events containing step&#8208;shaped features were consistently reported. 14 unique information nodes were developed which in principle could encode for 14  n  unique molecular barcodes in a barcode containing &#8220;n&#8221; information nodes. These barcode probes were adapted to detect different antibody proteins or cancer&#8208;related microRNAs, suggesting their immediate application in a wide variety of sensing applications.</dc:description>

         <title>PO43&#8208; Coordinated Robust Single&#8208;Atom Platinum&#160;Catalyst for Selective Polyol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving efficient catalytic conversion over heterogeneous catalyst with excellent resistance against leaching is still a grand challenge for sustainable chemical synthesis in aqueous solution. Herein, we devised a single&#8208;atom Pt  1  /hydroxyapatite (HAP) catalyst via a simple hydrothermal strategy. Gratifyingly, this robust Pt  1  /HAP catalyst exhibits remarkable catalytic selectivity and catalyst stability for the selective oxidation of C  2  &#8208;C  4  polyols to corresponding primary hydroxy acids. It is found that the Pt&#8208;(O&#8208;P) linkages with strong electronic&#8208;withdrawing function of PO  4  3&#8208;  (Pt  1  &#8208;OPO  4  3&#8208;  pair active site) not only realize the activation of C&#8208;H bond, but also destabilize the transition state from adsorbed hydroxy acids toward the C&#8208;C cleavage, resulting in the sharply increased selectivity of hydroxy acids. Moreover, the strong PO  4  3&#8208;  &#8208;coordination effect provides electrostatic stabilization for single&#8208;atom Pt, ensuring the highly efficient catalysis of Pt  1  /HAP for over 160 hours with superior leaching resistance.</dc:description>

         <title>A high&#8208;throughput approach to repurposing olefin polymerization catalysts for polymer upcycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient and economical plastic waste upcycling to prevent environmental accumulation relies on the development of catalysts capable of polymer degradation. A systematic high&#8208;throughput screening of twenty&#8208;eight polymerization catalysts precursors, belonging to the catalyst families of metallocenes, ansa&#8208;metallocenes, and hemi&#8208; and post&#8208;metallocenes, in cis&#8208;1,4&#8208;polybutadiene (PB) degradation reveals, for the first time, important structure&#8208;activity correlations. The upcycling conditions involve activation of the catalysts (at 0.18% catalyst loading) with 15&#8208;30 equiv of tri&#8208;iso&#8208;butyl aluminum at 50 &#176;C in toluene. The data indicate the ability to degrade PB is a general reactivity profile of neutral group 4 metal hydrides. A simple quantitative&#8208;structure activity relationship (QSAR) model utilizing two descriptors for the distribution of steric bulk in the active pocket and one descriptor measuring the electrophilicity of the metal ion reveals that the degradation ability increases with an a) increased but not overbearing steric congestion and b) lower electrophilicity.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Generation of (Iodinated) Polyarenes using Organogermane as Orthogonal Masking Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While the modular construction of molecules from suitable building blocks is a powerful means to more rapidly generate a diversity of molecules than through customized syntheses, the further evolution of the underlying coupling methodology is key to realize widespread applications. We herein disclose a complementary modular coupling approach to the widely employed Suzuki coupling strategy of boron containing precursors, which relies on organogermane containing building blocks as key orthogonal functionality and an electrophilic (rather than nucleophilic) unmasking event paired with air&#8208;stable Pd(I) dimer based bond construction. This allows to significantly shorten the reaction times for the iterative coupling steps and/or to close gaps in the accessible compound space, enabling straightforward access also to iodinated compounds.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Intermolecular C&#8722;H silylation for the synthesis of acyclic silanes bearing silicon&#8208;stereogenic center in one enantiomeric form remains unknown to date. Herein, we report the first enantioselective intermolecular C&#8722;H silylation of heteroarenes for the synthesis of acyclic silicon&#8208;stereogenic heteroarylsilanes. This process undergoes a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed direct intermolecular dehydrogenative Si&#8722;H/C&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling, giving access to a variety of acyclic heteroarylated silicon&#8208;stereogenic monohydrosilanes, including bis&#8208;Si&#8208;stereogenic silanes, in decent yields with excellent  chemo  &#8208;,  regio  &#8208;, and  stereo  &#8208;control, which significantly enlarge the chemical space of the optically active silicon&#8208;stereogenic monohydrosilanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Oligomer&#8208;assisted&#160;Photoactive Layers Enable&#160;&gt;18% Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although ternary organic solar cells (OSCs) have unique advantages in improving device performance, the morphology assembly in ternary&#8208;phase would be more uncertain or complex than that in binary&#8208;phase. Here, we propose a new concept of oligomer&#8208;assisted photoactive layers for high&#8208;performance OSCs. The formed alloy&#8208;like phase of the oligomer:host polymer blend enabled the oligomer&#8208;assisted OSCs fusing the advantages of both binary and ternary devices, exhibiting substantially enhanced performance and stability compared to the control devices. With the addition of oligomers, outstanding efficiencies of 17.33% for PM6:Y6 device, 18.32% for PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 device, and 17.13% for PM6/Y6 pseudo&#8208;bilayer device were achieved, all of which are one of the highest values in their corresponding fields. The improved performance originated from the downshift energy levels, enhanced light absorption, optimized blend morphology, favorable charge dynamics, and reduced non&#8208;radiative energy loss.</dc:description>

The improved performance originated from the downshift energy levels, enhanced light absorption, optimized blend morphology, favorable charge dynamics, and reduced non-radiative energy loss.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive C(sp2)&#8211;Si Coupling of Chlorohydrosilanes via Si&#8211;Cl Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here a new method for the synthesis of organohydrosilanes from phenols and ketones. This method is established through reductive C&#8211;Si coupling of chlorohydrosilanes via unconventional Si&#8211;Cl cleavage. The reaction offers access to aryl&#8208; and alkenylhydrosilanes with a scope that is complementary to those of the established methods. Electron&#8208;rich, electron&#8208;poor, and ortho&#8208;/meta&#8208;/para&#8208;substituted (hetero)aryl electrophiles, as well as cyclic and acyclic alkenyl electrophiles, were coupled successfully. Functionalities, including Grignard&#8208;sensitive groups (e.g., primary amine, amide, phenol, ketone, ester, and free indole), acid&#8208;sensitive groups (e.g., ketal and THP protection), alkyl&#8211;Cl, pyridine, furan, thiophene, Ar&#8211;Bpin, and Ar&#8211;SiMe3, were tolerated. Gram&#8208;scale reaction, incorporation of &#8208;Si(H)R2 into complex biologically active molecules, and derivatization of formed organohydrosilanes are demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong Nonlinearity Induced by Coaxial Alignment of Polar Chain and Dense [BO3] Units in CaZn2(BO3)2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Discovery of new efficient nonlinear optical (NLO) materials with large second&#8208;order nonlinearity for short&#8208;wave UV spectral region (&#955;  PM  &#8804; 266 nm, PM = phase&#8208;matching) is still very challenging. Herein, by applying tetrahedra substitution strategy based on Sr  2  Be  2  B  2  O  7  (SBBO), a new beryllium&#8208;free borate CaZn  2  (BO  3  )  2  with double&#8208;layered configuration was rationally designed, which not only preserves the structural merits but also eliminates the limitations of SBBO crystal. CaZn  2  (BO  3  )  2  shows a large PM second harmonic generation (SHG) reponse of 3.8&#215;KDP, which is 38 times higher than its barium analogue.

         <title>Topochemical Postulates: Are They Relevant for Topochemical Reactions Occurring at Elevated Temperatures?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A rigid&#160;inositol derived monomer functionalized with azide and alkyne as the complementary reactive groups (CRGs) crystallized as three distinct polymorphs&#160;  I&#8208;III  . Despite the unsuitable orientation of CRGs in the crystals for complete polymerization, all the three polymorphs underwent regiospecific and quantitative topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) polymerization upon heating to yield three different polymorphs of 1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyl&#8208;linked&#8208;poly&#8208;  neo  &#8208;inositol. The molecules in these polymorphs exploit the weak intermolecular interactions, free space in the crystal lattice, and heat energy for their large and cooperative molecular motion to attain a transient reactive orientation, ultimately leading to the regiospecific TAAC reaction yielding distinct crystalline polymers. This study cautions that the overreliance on topochemical postulates for the prediction of topochemical reactivity at high temperatures could be misleading.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Adamantyl&#8208;dioxetane luminophores are an important class of chemiluminescent molecular probes for diagnostics and imaging. We have developed a new efficient synthetic route for preparation of adamantyl&#8208;enolether as precursors for dioxetane chemiluminescent luminophores. The synthesis is convergent, using an unusual Stille cross&#8208;coupling reaction employing a stannane&#8208;enolether, to directly afford adamantyl&#8208;enolether. In a following simple step, the dioxetane is obtained by oxidation of the enolether precursor with singlet&#8208;oxygen. The scope of this synthetic route is broad since a large number of haloaryl substrates are either commercially available or easily accessible.&#160;Such a late&#8208;stage derivatization strategy simplifies the rapid exploration of novel luminogenic molecular structures in a library format and simplifies the synthesis of known dioxetane luminophores.&#160;We expect that this new synthetic strategy will be particularly useful in the design and synthesis of yet unexplored dioxetane chemiluminescent luminophores.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Molecular Trefoil Knots Featuring Pentadecanuclear Homoleptic AuI&#8208;, AuI/AgI&#8208;, or AuI/CuI&#8208;Alkynyl Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Au15 molecular trefoil knots, based on AuI&#8208;alkynyl coordination and featuring AuI&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;AuI interactions, self&#8208;assemble without requiring bi&#8208; or multidentate/multipodal ligands. These trefoil knots with unprecedentedly high metal nuclearity per trefoil knot strand react with CuI/AgI species to give Au9M6 (M=Cu/Ag) trefoil knots. The solid&#8208;state structures, solution behavior, and photoluminescence properties of the trefoil knots were investigated.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free and metal&#8208;containing molecular trefoil knots are fascinating ensembles that are usually covalently assembled, the latter requiring the rational design of di&#8208; or multidentate/multipodal ligands as connectors. In this work, we describe the self&#8208;assembly of pentadecanuclear AuI trefoil knots [Au15(C&#8801;CR)15] from monoalkynes HC&#8801;CR (R=9,9&#8208;X2&#8208;fluorenyl with X=nBu, n&#8208;hexyl) and [AuI(THT)Cl]. Hetero&#8208;bimetallic counterparts [Au9M6(C&#8801;CR)15] (M=Cu/Ag) were self&#8208;assembled by reactions of [Au15(C&#8801;CR)15] with [Cu(MeCN)4]+/AgNO3 and HC&#8801;CR. The type of pentadecanuclear trefoil knots described herein is characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, 2D NMR and HR&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS. [Au9Cu6(C&#8801;CR)15] is relatively stable in hexane; its excited state properties were investigated. DFT calculations revealed that non&#8208;covalent metal&#8211;metal and metal&#8211;ligand interactions, together with longer alkyl chain&#8208;strengthened inter&#8208;ligand dispersion interactions, govern the stability of the trefoil knot structures.

&lt;/b&gt; molecular trefoil knots, based on Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;-alkynyl coordination and featuring Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; interactions, self-assemble without requiring bi- or multidentate/multipodal ligands. These trefoil knots with unprecedentedly high metal nuclearity per trefoil knot strand react with Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;/Ag&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; species to give &lt;b&gt;Au&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; (M=Cu/Ag) trefoil knots. The solid-state structures, solution behavior, and photoluminescence properties of the trefoil knots were investigated.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal-free and metal-containing molecular trefoil knots are fascinating ensembles that are usually covalently assembled, the latter requiring the rational design of di- or multidentate/multipodal ligands as connectors. In this work, we describe the self-assembly of pentadecanuclear Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; trefoil knots [Au&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;(C&#8801;CR)&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;] from monoalkynes HC&#8801;CR (R=9,9-X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-fluorenyl with X=&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;Bu, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-hexyl) and [Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;(THT)Cl]. Hetero-bimetallic counterparts [Au&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(C&#8801;CR)&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;] (M=Cu/Ag) were self-assembled by reactions of [Au&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;(C&#8801;CR)&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;] with [Cu(MeCN)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and HC&#8801;CR. The type of pentadecanuclear trefoil knots described herein is characterized by X-ray crystallography, 2D NMR and HR-ESI-MS. [Au&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(C&#8801;CR)&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;] is relatively stable in hexane; its excited state properties were investigated. DFT calculations revealed that non-covalent metal&#8211;metal and metal&#8211;ligand interactions, together with longer alkyl chain-strengthened inter-ligand dispersion interactions, govern the stability of the trefoil knot structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single&#8208;Cell Quantification of a Highly Biocompatible Dinuclear Iridium(III) Complex for Photocatalytic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantification of intracellular content of metal&#8208;based anticancer drugs in a single cancer cell remains a challenge. Here, we used single&#8208;cell inductively coupled plasma&#8208;mass spectrometry to study the uptake and retention of mononuclear (Ir1) and dinuclear (Ir2) Ir(III) photo&#8208;redox catalysts in every single cancer cell. This method allowed rapid and precise quantification of drug in individual cancer cells. Importantly, Ir2 showed a significant synergism but not an additive effect for NAD(P)H photocatalytic oxidation. The lysosome&#8208;targeting Ir2 showed low dark toxicity in&#8208;vitro and in&#8208;vivo. Ir2 exhibited high photocatalytic therapeutic efficiency at 525 nm with an excellent photo&#8208;index in&#8208;vitro and against tumor&#8208;bearing mice model in vivo. Interestingly, the photocatalytic anticancer profile of the dinuclear Ir2 was much better than the mononuclear Ir1, indicating for the first time that dinuclear metal&#8208;based photocatalysts can be applied for photocatalytic anticancer research.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric&#160;&#946;&#8208;Oxygen Elimination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A catalytic enantioselective &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;elimination reaction is reported in the form of a zirconium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric opening of  meso  &#8208;ketene acetals. Furthermore, a regiodivergent &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;elimination is demonstrated. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, at low catalyst loadings, and produces chiral monoprotected  cis  &#8208;1,2&#8208;diols in good yield and enantiomeric excess. The combination with a Mitsunobu reaction or a one&#8208;pot hydroboration/Suzuki reaction sequence then give&#160;access to additional diol and aminoalcohol building blocks. A stereochemical analysis supported by DFT calculations reveals that a high selectivity in the hydrozirconation step is also important for achieving high enantioselectivity, although it does not constitute the asymmetric step. This insight is crucial for the future development of related asymmetric &#946;&#8208;elimination reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Click Synthesis Enabled Sulfur Atom Strategy for Polymerization&#8208;enhanced and Two&#8208;photon Photosensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Facile tailoring of photosensitizers (PSs) with advanced and synergetic properties is highly expected to broaden and deepen the photodynamic therapy (PDT) applications. Herein, a catalyst&#8208;free thiol&#8208;yne click reaction was employed to develop the sulfur atom&#8208;based PSs by using the in situ formed sulfur &#8220;heavy atom effect&#8221; to enhance the intersystem crossing (ISC), while such effect can be remarkably magnified by the polymerization. The introduction of tetraphenylpyrazine&#8208;based aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) unit was also advantageous in PS design by suppressing their non&#8208;radiative decay to facilitate the ISC in the aggregated state. Besides, the resulting sulfur atom electron donor, together with double bond &#960; bridge and AIE electron acceptor, created a D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A molecular system with good two&#8208;photon excitation properties. Combined with the high singlet oxygen generation efficiency, the fabricated polymer nanoparticles exhibited an excellent in vitro two photon&#8208;excited PDT towards the cancer cells, therefore possessing a huge potential for the deep&#8208;tissue disease therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Biologically Safe, Versatile, and Smart Bismuthene Functionalized with a Drug Delivery System Based on Red Phosphorus Quantum Dots for Cancer Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials are currently attracting widespread attention for cancer therapy. However, high toxicity, insensitivity to external stimuli and single therapeutic modality are still key issues hindering their clinical application. Therefore, the construction of a secure, intelligent and versatile nanocomposite is necessary to meet clinical expectations. Herein, we developed a nanocomposite of Bi@RP&#8208;PEG&#8208;DOX with 2D bismuthene loaded with 0D red phosphorus quantum dots and DOX. The nanocomposite with DOX loading capacity (~250%) and photothermal conversion efficiency (~54%) showed synergistic photothermal and photodynamic effects and a sensitive response of drug release to the acidic tumor microenvironment or NIR &#8545; laser irradiation. In particular, based on the Bi and RP, the nanocomposite exhibits good biosafety. Moreover, with the X&#8208;ray attenuation properties of bismuth, the nanocomposite serves as an excellent CT contrast agent, providing potential to perform CT&#8208;guided therapy. Overall, this work provides a promising, biosafe and synergistic strategy for clinical nanomedicine.</dc:description>

Upon irradiation with visible light and sensitization with thioxanthen&#8208;9&#8208;one (TXT), substituted indoles undergo a facile and high&#8208;yielding hydrogen atom transfer/cyclization cascade to dearomatized, spirocyclic products.







Abstract
The photochemical synthesis of yet unknown 2&#8208;oxospiro[azetidine&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;indolines] (17 examples, 80&#8211;95&#8201;% yield), 2,4&#8208;dioxospiro[azetidine&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;indolines] (eight examples, 87&#8211;97&#8201;% yield), and 1&#8208;oxo&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydrospiro[indene&#8208;2,3&#8242;&#8208;indolines] (17 examples, 85&#8211;97&#8201;% yield) is described. Starting from readily accessible 3&#8208;substituted indoles, a dearomatization of the indole core was accomplished upon irradiation at &#955;=420&#8197;nm in the presence of thioxanthen&#8208;9&#8208;one (10&#8197;mol%) as the sensitizer. Based on mechanistic evidence (triplet energy determination, deuteration experiments, by&#8208;product analysis) it is proposed that the reaction proceeds by energy transfer via a 1,4&#8208; or 1,5&#8208;diradical intermediate. The latter intermediates are formed by excited state hydrogen atom transfer from suitable alkyl groups within the C3 substituent to the indole C2 carbon atom. Subsequent ring closure proceeds with pronounced diastereoselectivity to generate a 4&#8208; or 5&#8208;membered spirocyclic dearomatized product with several options for further functionalization.

         <title>Selective Coupling of 1,2&#8208;Bis&#8208;Boronic Esters at the more Substituted Site through Visible&#8208;Light Activation of Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The site&#8208;selective monofunctionalization of 1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;boronic esters was achieved by using a catalyst&#8208;free photoinduced coupling with (hetero)aryl nitriles. The reaction proceeds through electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complex&#8208;driven deboronation and radical 1,2&#8208;boron shift, giving &#946;&#8208;aryl primary boronic ester products. The reaction also works with primary, secondary, and tertiary boronic esters.







Abstract
1,2&#8208;Bis&#8208;boronic esters are useful synthetic intermediates particularly as the two boronic esters can be selectively functionalized. Usually, the less hindered primary boronic ester reacts, but herein, we report a coupling reaction that enables the reversal of this selectivity. This is achieved through the formation of a boronate complex with an electron&#8208;rich aryllithium which, in the presence of an electron&#8208;deficient aryl nitrile, leads to the formation of an electron donor&#8211;acceptor complex. Following visible&#8208;light photoinduced electron transfer, a primary radical is generated which isomerizes to the more stable secondary radical before radical&#8208;radical coupling with the arene radical&#8208;anion, giving &#946;&#8208;aryl primary boronic ester products. The reactions proceed under catalyst&#8208;free conditions. This method also allows stereodivergent coupling of cyclic cis&#8208;1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;boronic esters to provide trans&#8208;substituted products, complementing the selectivity observed in the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reaction.

         <title>Intrinsic Hole Mobility in Luminescent Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks and Its Application in Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A design concept involving introduction of sp3&#8208;hybridized nitrogen atom to conjugated organic linkers leads to intrinsic hole mobility in a luminescent metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). The triarylamine&#8208;based MOF (Zr&#8208;NBP) has strong fluorescence and high hole mobility of 1.05&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. A thin film of Zr&#8208;NBP in pure phase was used directly as an emissive layer (EML) and a hole&#8208;transporting layer (HTL) in OLED devices.







Abstract
Most metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) lack charge mobility, which is crucial for realizing their use in optoelectronic applications. This work proposes the design of a MOF using triarylamine&#8208;based ligands (Zr&#8208;NBP) as the lone pair electron spacer to enhance the hole mobility in the MOF while maintaining its luminescent properties. Zr&#8208;NBP has strong fluorescence with a good hole mobility of 1.05&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, which is comparable to organic materials used in optoelectronic devices. We also employed a Zr&#8208;NBP nanofilm in the pure phase as both a non&#8208;doped emissive layer and a hole&#8208;transporting layer within organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The obtained OLED device produced a bright green light with a low turn&#8208;on voltage of 3.9&#8197;V. This work presents an advance in developing the electronic properties of MOFs by modifying the chemical properties of its building blocks, and will likely inspire further design of MOF materials as active layers in optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Selectively Regulating Lewis Acid&#8211;Base Sites in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Achieving Turn&#8208;On/Off of the Catalytic Activity in Different CO2 Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective regulation of Lewis acid&#8211;base sites in metal&#8211;organic framework catalysts is an effective strategy to turn&#8208;on/off of the catalytic activity for different CO2 reactions.







Abstract
Regulating Lewis acid&#8211;base sites in catalysts to investigate their influence in the chemical fixation of CO2 is significant but challenging. A metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with open metal Co sites, {(NH2Me2)[Co3(&#956;3&#8208;OH)(BTB)2(H2O)]&#8901;9&#8201;H2O&#8901;5&#8201;DMF}n (1), was obtained and the results of the catalytic investigation show that 1 can catalyze cycloaddition of CO2 and aziridines to give 99&#8201;% yield. The efficiency of the cyclization of CO2 with propargyl amines is only 32&#8201;%. To improve the catalytic ability of 1, ligand XN with Lewis base sites was introduced into 1 and coordinated with the open Co sites, resulting in a decrease of the Lewis acid sites and an increase in the Lewis base sites in a related MOF 2 ({(NH2Me2)[Co3(&#956;3&#8208;OH)(NHMe2)(BTB)2(XN)]&#8901;8&#8201;H2O&#8901;4&#8201;DMF}n). Selective regulation of the type of active centers causes the yield of oxazolidinones to be enhanced by about 2.4 times, suggesting that this strategy can turn on/off the catalytic activity for different reactions. The catalytic results from 2 treated with acid solution support this conclusion. This work illuminates a MOF&#8208;construction strategy that produces efficient catalysts for CO2 conversion.

         <title>Out&#8208;of&#8208;Equilibrium Self&#8208;Replication Allows Selection for Dynamic Kinetic Stability in a System of Competing Replicators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two competing self&#8208;replicators are formed from two different dithiol building blocks through oxidation and disulfide exchange. The self&#8208;replicators differ in their size, building block composition, and dynamic kinetic stability. The slower replicator prevails over the faster competitor in a closed vial, but the outcome of the competition is reversed in an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium replication&#8211;destruction regime, implemented in a flow system.







Abstract
Among the key characteristics of living systems are their ability to self&#8208;replicate and the fact that they exist in an open system away from equilibrium. Herein, we show how the outcome of the competition between two self&#8208;replicators, differing in size and building block composition, is different depending on whether the experiments are conducted in a closed vial or in an open and out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium replication&#8211;destruction regime. In the closed system, the slower replicator eventually prevails over the faster competitor. In a replication&#8208;destruction regime, implemented through a flow system, the outcome of the competition is reversed and the faster replicator dominates. The interpretation of the experimental observations is supported by a mass&#8208;action&#8208;kinetics model. These results represent one of the few experimental manifestations of selection among competing self&#8208;replicators based on dynamic kinetic stability and pave the way towards Darwinian evolution of abiotic systems.

         <title>Synthesis of Molecular Phenylcalcium Derivatives: Application to the Formation of Biaryls</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isolable and hydrocarbon&#8208;soluble &#946;&#8208;diketiminato calcium phenyls are accessible from the reaction of Ph2Hg and [(BDI)CaH]2. The compounds were shown to react with bromoarenes through a direct SNAr displacement of halide, leading to the uncatalyzed formation of biaryl molecules.







Abstract
Hydrocarbon&#8208;soluble &#946;&#8208;diketiminato phenylcalcium derivatives, which display various modes of Ca&#8722;&#956;2&#8208;Ph&#8722;Ca bridging, are accessible from reactions of Ph2Hg and [(BDI)CaH]2. Although the resultant compounds are inert toward the C&#8722;H bonds of benzene, they yield selective and uncatalyzed biaryl formation when reacted with readily available aryl bromides.

         <title>Photoswitchable Serotonins for Optical Control of the 5&#8208;HT2A Receptor**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first&#8208;in&#8208;class photoswitchable agonists for the 5HT2A receptor (serotonin family GPCR) have been developed. Bifunctional, tethered variants (PORTLs) enable genetically targeted optical control.







Abstract
Serotonin receptors play central roles in neuromodulation and are critical drug targets for psychiatric disorders. Optical control of serotonin receptor subtypes has the potential to greatly enhance our understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of receptor function. While other neuromodulatory receptors have been successfully rendered photoswitchable, reversible photocontrol of serotonin receptors has not been achieved, representing a major gap in GPCR photopharmacology. Herein, we develop the first tools that allow for such control. Azo5HT&#8208;2 shows light&#8208;dependent 5&#8208;HT2AR agonism, with greater activity in the cis&#8208;form. Based on docking and test compound analysis, we also develop photoswitchable orthogonal, remotely&#8208;tethered ligands (PORTLs). These BG&#8208;Azo5HTs provide rapid, reversible, and repeatable optical control following conjugation to SNAP&#8208;tagged 5&#8208;HT2AR. Overall, this study provides a foundation for the broad extension of photopharmacology to the serotonin receptor family.

         <title>Alternating Current Electrolysis Enabled Formal C&#8722;O/O&#8722;H Cross&#8208;Metathesis of 4&#8208;Alkoxy Anilines with Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel alternating current promoted formal C&#8722;O/O&#8722;H cross&#8208;metathesis reaction of 4&#8208;alkoxy anilines with alcohols has been developed for the first time.







Abstract
While multiple bond metathesis reactions, for example olefin metathesis, have seen considerable recent progress, direct metathesis of traditionally inert C&#8722;O single bonds is extremely rare and particularly challenging. Undoubtedly, metathesis reaction of C&#8722;O bonds is one of the most ideal routes for the value&#8208;added upgrading of molecules involving C&#8722;O bonds. Reported here is a new protocol to achieve the formal C&#8722;O/O&#8722;H cross&#8208;metathesis via alternating current electrolysis. Featuring mild reaction conditions, the protocol allows readily available 4&#8208;alkoxy anilines and alcohols to be converted into a wide range of valuable products in highly regioselective and chemoselective manner. Moreover, the present strategy can be used in the late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceuticals as well as biologically active compounds, which demonstrated the potential application.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Cages with {SiW9Ni4} Polyoxotungstate Nodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discrete metal&#8211;organic cages with polyoxotungstate nodes were assembled from a tritopic Keggin cluster, {SiW9Ni4}, and rigid dicarboxylates. Varying the bend angles of the linkers from 122&#176; to 180&#176; allows a set of POM2nL3n&#8208;type cages to be realized. The fact they can serve as highly effective photocatalysts for CO2 reduction opens up future opportunities for novel functions and applications by taking advantage of the confinement effect of their void spaces.







Abstract
A tritopic, Ni&#8208;substituted Keggin cluster, {SiW9Ni4}, assembles with rigid dicarboxylate linkers to give rise to a set of discrete, POM2nL3n&#8208;type structures (POM={SiW9Ni4}) with defined interior voids. The outcome of coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assemblies of these polyhedral cages&#8212;from fused dimers to trigonal prisms&#8212;was found to be sensitive to bend angles of the ditopic ligands, which vary from 122&#176; to 180&#176;. These polyoxotungstate&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic polyhedra, when coupled with [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 as a photosensitizer and triethanolamine as the electron donor, serve as highly effective catalysts for CO2 reduction, with turnover numbers up to 328 and CO selectivity as high as 96.2&#8201;%. The inner cavities of such cage structures, if functionalized or of sufficient size to encapsulate targeted guest molecules, could present a new strategy towards functional materials for potential applications.

         <title>The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike Glycoprotein Directly Binds Exogeneous Sialic Acids: A NMR View</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NMR experiments using 13C&#8208;labelled sialyl&#8208;containing trisaccharides unequivocally demonstrate that the N&#8208;terminal domain of the Spike (S) SARS CoV&#8208;2 glycoprotein directly binds sialic acid residues, highlighting the possibility of additional cellular receptor loci for the viral S protein at our cells.







Abstract
The interaction of the SARS CoV2 spike glycoprotein with two sialic acid&#8208;containing trisaccharides (&#945;2,3 and &#945;2,6 sialyl N&#8208;acetyllactosamine) has been demonstrated by NMR. The NMR&#8208;based distinction between the signals of those sialic acids in the glycans covalently attached to the spike protein and those belonging to the exogenous &#945;2,3 and &#945;2,6 sialyl N&#8208;acetyllactosamine ligands has been achieved by synthesizing uniformly 13C&#8208;labelled trisaccharides at the sialic acid and galactose moieties. STD&#8208;1H,13C&#8208;HSQC NMR experiments elegantly demonstrate the direct interaction of the sialic acid residues of both trisaccharides with additional participation of the galactose moieties, especially for the &#945;2,3&#8208;linked analogue. Additional experiments with the spike protein in the presence of a specific antibody for the N&#8208;terminal domain and with the isolated receptor binding and N&#8208;terminal domains of the spike protein unambiguously show that the sialic acid binding site is located at the N&#8208;terminal domain.

         <title>Comprehensive Pore Tuning in an Ultrastable Fluorinated Anion Cross&#8208;Linked Cage&#8208;Like MOF for Simultaneous Benchmark Propyne Recovery and Propylene Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented ultrastable fluorinated anion cross&#8208;linked cage&#8208;like MOF (ZNU&#8208;2) was prepared for benchmark propyne/propylene separation with large C3H4 capacity (7.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1), high C3H4/C3H6 selectivity (16.2), low adsorption enthalpy (43.0&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and high practical C3H4 and C3H6 productivity due to the precise control of pore size, shape and functionality.







Abstract
Propyne/propylene (C3H4/C3H6) separation is an important but challenging industrial process to produce polymer&#8208;grade C3H6 and recover high&#8208;purity C3H4. Herein, we report an ultrastable TiF62&#8722; anion cross&#8208;linked metal&#8211;organic framework (ZNU&#8208;2) with precisely controlled pore size, shape and functionality for benchmark C3H4 storage (3.9/7.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.01/1.0&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K) and record high C3H4/C3H6 (10/90) separation potential (31.0&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1). The remarkable C3H4/C3H6 (1/99, 10/90, 50/50) separation performance was fully demonstrated by simulated and experimental breakthroughs under various conditions with excellent recyclability and high productivity (42&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1) of polymer&#8208;grade C3H6 from a 1/99&#8197;C3H4/C3H6 mixture. A modelling study revealed that the symmetrical spatial distribution of six TiF62&#8722; on the icosahedral cage surface provides two distinct binding sites for C3H4 adsorption: one serves as a tailored single C3H4 molecule trap and the other boosts C3H4 accommodation by cooperative host&#8211;guest and guest&#8211;guest interactions.

         <dc:description>We herein describe a new design principle to achieve B/N&#8208;doped cyclophane where an electron&#8208;donor block of three triarylamines (Ar  3  N) and acceptor block of three triarylboranes (Ar  3  B) are spatially separated on opposite sides of the &#960;&#8208;extended ring system. DFT computations revealed the distinct electronic structure of the  block  &#8208;type macrocycle  MC&#8208;  b  &#8208;B3N3  with a greatly enhanced dipole moment and reduced HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap in comparison to its analogue with alternating B and N sites,  MC&#8208;  alt  &#8208;B3N3  . The unique arrangement of borane acceptor Ar  3  B and amine donor Ar  3  N components in  MC&#8208;  b  &#8208;B3N3  induces exceptionally strong intramolecular charge transfer in the excited state, which is reflected in a largely red&#8208;shifted luminescence at 612 nm in solution. The respective linear open&#8208;chain oligomer  L&#8208;  b  &#8208;B3N3  was also synthesized for comparison. Our new approach to donor&#8208;acceptor macrocycles offers important fundamental insights and opens up a new avenue to unique optoelectronic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Confined Indium Oxides for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Reduction in a Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte Flow Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing robust electrocatalyst and advanced devices is important for electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction toward the generation of valuable chemicals. We present herein a carbon&#8208;confined indium oxides electrocatalyst for stable and efficient CO2 reduction. The reductive corrosion of oxidative indium to metallic state during electrolysis could be prevented due to carbon protection, and the applied carbon layer also optimizes the reaction intermediate adsorption, which enables both high selectivity and activity for CO2 reduction. In a liquid&#8208;phase flow cell, the formate selectivity exceeds 90% in a wide potential window from &#8208;0.8 V to &#8208;1.3 V vs. RHE. The continuous production of ~ 0.12 M pure formic acid solution is further demonstrated at a current density of 30 mA cm&#8722;2 in a solid&#8208;state electrolyte mediated reactor. This work provides significant concepts in the parallel development of electrocatalysts and devices for carbon&#8208;neutral technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Inhibition of Alkali Metal Reduction of 1&#8208;Adamantanol by London Dispersion Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of alkali metal 1&#8208;adamantoxide (OAd1) complexes of formula [M(OAd1)(HOAd1)2], where M = Li, Na or K, was synthesised by reduction of 1&#8208;adamantanol with excess of the alkali metal. The syntheses indicated that only one out of every three HOAd1 molecules was reduced. An X&#8208;ray diffraction study of the sodium derivative shows that the complex features two unreduced HOAd1 donors as well as the reduced alkoxide (OAd1), with the Ad1 fragments clustered together on the same side of the NaO3 plane, contrary to steric considerations.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A series of alkali metal 1-adamantoxide (OAd1) complexes of formula [M(OAd1)(HOAd1)2], where M = Li, Na or K, was synthesised by reduction of 1-adamantanol with excess of the alkali metal. The syntheses indicated that only one out of every three HOAd1 molecules was reduced. An X-ray diffraction study of the sodium derivative shows that the complex features two unreduced HOAd1 donors as well as the reduced alkoxide (OAd1), with the Ad1 fragments clustered together on the same side of the NaO3 plane, contrary to steric considerations.

         <title>Water&#8208;Soluble Doubly&#8208;Strapped Isolated Perylene Diimide Chromophore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perylene diimides (PDIs), a well&#8208;studied class of organic dyes, have a strong tendency to self&#8208;aggregate in water, thus greatly restricting their phototheranostic applications. Herein, we report a water&#8208;soluble PDI cyclophane &#8220;Gemini Box&#8221; (GBox&#8208;14+), consisting of a central PDI chromophore enclosed by a double cationic molecular strap. Owing to the effective spatial isolation, the chromophore self&#8208;aggregation can be completely eliminated, even in a concentrated aqueous solution up to 2 mM. To our knowledge, GBox&#8208;14+ represents an interesting example of a fluorescent PDI cyclophane in water, capable of being employed for lysosome&#8208;targetable live&#8208;cell imaging. More importantly, the highly concentrated aqueous solution of PDI radical anion can be significantly stabilized by GBox&#8208;14+ to exhibit an excellent near&#8208;infrared photothermal effect, which was further exploited for efficient and selective antibacterial applications. This work provides a new access to water&#8208;soluble non&#8208;aggregated organic dyes and promotes their potential biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new isolation protocol was recently reported for highly purified metallic Fullertubes D  5h  &#8208;C  90  , D  3d  &#8208;C  96  , and D  5d  &#8208;C  100  which exhibit unique electronic features. Here, we report disclose the oxygen reduction electrocatalytic behaviour of C  60  , C  70  (spheroidal fullerenes), and C  90  , C  96  , and C  100  (tubular fullerenes) using a combination of experimental and theoretical techniques. C  96  (a metal&#8208;free catalyst) displayed remarkable ORR activity, with an onset potential of 0.85 V and a halfway potential of 0.75 V, which are close to the values of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C benchmark catalyst. We achieved an excellent power density of 0.75 W/cm  2  using C  96  as a modified cathode in a proton exchange membrane fuel cell, comparable to other recently reported efficient metal&#8208;free catalysts. Combined band structure (experimentally calculated) and free&#8208;energy (DFT) investigations show that both favourable energy&#8208;level alignment and highly selective active catalytic sites on the carbon cage are responsible for the C  96  superior activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemically controlled switchable copolymerization of lactide, carbon dioxide, and epoxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical redox&#8208;control is an emerging strategy for the regulation of polymerization process without the addition of external oxidants and reductants, which enables the control over composition, microstructure and properties of the polymer products. In this paper, based on the chemical selectivity of heterometallic Salen&#8208;Co&#8208;Mn complexes of different valences, an electrochemically switchable strategy was developed for the copolymerization of lactide (LA), CO2 &amp; epoxides. The switchable redox reactions endowed this system with the capability to easily synthesize a multi&#8208;block copolymer of polylactide (PLA) and polycarbonate (PC). Moreover, the multi&#8208;block copolymer could be further modified by introducing various monomers with different microstructures and functional groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Transient Plasmonic Imaging of Ion Migration on Single Nanoparticles and Insight for Double Layer Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion migration on single nanoparticles was directly measured by using a transient microscopy method. Under nanoscale and transient conditions, the electric double layer (EDL) dynamics can deviate significantly from the prediction made by using the classical resistance&#8211;capacitance model. A new model was proposed to describe the transient dynamics of EDL formation.







Abstract
Single&#8208;nanoparticle electrochemistry offers electrochemical behaviors of individual entities beyond the ensemble system. An electric double layer (EDL) exists on any charged particle&#8211;liquid interface because of counter&#8208;ion accumulation, while direct measuring of the interfacial ion migration remains a challenge. Herein, a plasmonic&#8208;based transient microscopic method, with a temporal resolution of 1&#8211;2&#8197;&#956;s, was demonstrated to directly track the ion migration dynamics on single charged nanoparticles. We found that the dynamics of EDL formation might deviate significantly from the prediction made by using the classical resistance&#8211;capacitance (RC) model under nanoscale and transient conditions. Under ultrafast charging, due to the limit migration rate of ions in the solution, the actual time scale of the EDL formation could be up to 5&#8197;times slower than the predicted value from the RC model. We then proposed a new theoretical model to describe the transient dynamics of EDL formation. These results may expand our current knowledge about nano&#8208;electrochemistry and transient electrochemistry.

         <title>Engineering Olefin&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photoenzymatic Reduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new photocatalyst&#8211;enzyme coupled artificial photosynthesis system was constructed for photoenzymatic reduction of CO2 using COFs as enzyme carriers. The hybrid system showed an apparent quantum yield as high as 9.17&#177;0.44&#8201;%, surpassing the reported NADH&#8208;regenerated photocatalysts of crystalline framework materials.







Abstract
It is of profound significance concerning the global energy and environmental crisis to develop new techniques that can reduce and convert CO2. To address this challenge, we built a new type of artificial photoenzymatic system for CO2 reduction, using a rationally designed mesoporous olefin&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF) as the porous solid carrier for co&#8208;immobilizing formate dehydrogenase (FDH) and Rh&#8208;based electron mediator. By adjusting the incorporating content of the Rh electronic mediator, which facilitates the regeneration of nicotinamide cofactor (NADH) from NAD+, the apparent quantum yield can reach as high as 9.17&#177;0.44&#8201;%, surpassing all reported NADH&#8208;regenerated photocatalysts constructed by crystalline framework materials. Finally, the assembled photocatalyst&#8211;enzyme coupled system can selectively convert CO2 to formic acid with high efficiency and good reusability. This work demonstrates the first example using COFs to immobilize enzymes for artificial photosynthesis systems that utilize solar energy to produce value&#8208;added chemicals.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Precision Synthesis of AB, ABA and ABC Block Copolymers via Switchable Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise synthesis of well&#8208;defined block copolymers with molecular complexity by simple techniques has always been a meaningful but rarely achieved task. Here, a commercial switchable catalysis is reported comprising a delicate &#8220;double switch&#8221; process. This unique switch can be applied up to pentacomponent mixtures to prepare sequence&#8208;controlled AB, ABA, and ABC copolymers.







Abstract
The switchable catalysis using a commercial salenMn catalyst was firstly developed and applied in the one&#8208;pot selective copolymerization from anhydrides, epoxides, CO2 and &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone (&#1013;&#8208;CL) mixtures for the precise synthesis of AB, ABA and novel ABC block copolymers. The observed unique double switch process comprising three different polymerization cycles was rationalized by theoretical calculations. Surprisingly, the first block turned out to be an efficient macromolecular initiator for the consecutive introduction of carbonate linkages into copolymers, albeit with dominant cyclization with the catalyst alone. Further, through the selective reaction on different epoxides, the switchable copolymerization of up to five monomers was achieved yielding well&#8208;defined multi&#8208;block copolymers with structural diversity and functionality.

         <title>Highly Efficient Polarizing Agents for MAS&#8208;DNP of Proton&#8208;Dense Molecular Solids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new polarizing agent is introduced to efficiently polarize proton&#8208;dense solids through dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) ssNMR. This work shows that this new biradical can be used on organic microcrystals and biomolecular assemblies at high field and fast magic angle spinning (MAS). It notably unlocks the rapid acquisition of 13C&#8211;13C and 15N&#8211;13C correlations of pharmaceutical drugs at natural isotopic abundance, which are key experiments for structure determination.







Abstract
Efficiently hyperpolarizing proton&#8208;dense molecular solids through dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) solid&#8208;state NMR is still an unmet challenge. Polarizing agents (PAs) developed so far do not perform well on proton&#8208;rich systems, such as organic microcrystals and biomolecular assemblies. Herein we introduce a new PA, cAsymPol&#8208;POK, and report outstanding hyperpolarization efficiency on 12.76&#8197;kDa U&#8208;13C,15N&#8208;labeled LecA protein and pharmaceutical drugs at high magnetic fields (up to 18.8&#8197;T) and fast magic angle spinning (MAS) frequencies (up to 40&#8197;kHz). The performance of cAsymPol&#8208;POK is rationalized by MAS&#8208;DNP simulations combined with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD). This work shows that this new biradical is compatible with challenging biomolecular applications and unlocks the rapid acquisition of 13C&#8211;13C and 15N&#8211;13C correlations of pharmaceutical drugs at natural isotopic abundance, which are key experiments for structure determination.

         <title>Generic Rules for Distinguishing Autophoretic Colloidal Motors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;diffusiophoretic motors slow down sharply with population density while self&#8208;electrophoretic motors maintain an almost constant speed regardless of their population density. Self&#8208;diffusiophoretic motors form continuously growing clusters, while self&#8208;electrophoretic motors form dynamic clusters with limited sizes.







Abstract
Distinguishing the operating mechanisms of nano&#8208; and micromotors powered by chemical gradients, i.e. &#8220;autophoresis&#8221;, holds the key for fundamental and applied reasons. In this article, we propose and experimentally confirm that the speeds of a self&#8208;diffusiophoretic colloidal motor scale inversely to its population density but not for self&#8208;electrophoretic motors, because the former is an ion source and thus increases the solution ionic strength over time while the latter does not. They also form clusters in visually distinguishable and quantifiable ways. This pair of rules is simple, powerful, and insensitive to the specific material composition, shape or size of a colloidal motor, and does not require any measurement beyond typical microscopy. These rules are not only useful in clarifying the operating mechanisms of typical autophoretic micromotors, but also in predicting the dynamics of unconventional ones that are yet to be experimentally realized, even those involving enzymes.

         <title>Overlooked Factors Required for Electrolyte Solvents in Li&#8211;O2 Batteries: Capabilities of Quenching 1O2 and Forming Highly&#8208;Decomposable Li2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li&#8211;O2 batteries (LOBs) equipped with a N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide&#8208;based electrolyte exhibited superior cycle characteristics based on the capabilities of quenching 1O2 and forming highly decomposable Li2O2, which have been overlooked as factors required for electrolyte solvents for LOBs.







Abstract
Although sufficient tolerance against attack by superoxide radicals (O2&#8722;) has been mainly recognized as an important property for Li&#8211;O2 battery (LOB) electrolytes, recent evidence has revealed that other critical factors also govern the cyclability, prompting a reconsideration of the basic design guidelines of LOB electrolytes. Here, we found that LOBs equipped with a N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (DMA)&#8208;based electrolyte exhibited better cyclability compared with other standard LOB electrolytes. This superior cyclability is attributable to the capabilities of quenching 1O2 and forming highly decomposable Li2O2. The 1O2 quenching capability is equivalent to that of a tetraglyme&#8208;based electrolyte containing a several millimolar concentration of a typical chemical quencher. Based on these overlooked factors, the DMA&#8208;based electrolyte led to superior cyclability despite its lower O2&#8722; tolerance. Thus, the present work provides a novel design guideline for the development of LOB electrolytes.

         <title>Thermal Dynamic Self&#8208;Healing Supramolecular Dopant Towards Efficient and Stable Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphiphilic supramolecular adhesives with low glass transition temperature and massive hydrogen bonds were designed by random copolymerization of acrylamide and n&#8208;butyl acrylate. The adhesive dopant facilitates a dynamic thermal self&#8208;healing effect at only 70&#8201;&#176;C and contributes to efficient and highly flexible perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells (FPSCs) have attracted great attention due to their advantageous traits such as low cost, portability, light&#8208;weight, etc. However, mechanical stability is still the weak point in their practical application. Herein, we prepared efficient FPSCs with remarkable mechanical stability by a dynamic thermal self&#8208;healing effect, which can be realized by the usage of a supramolecular adhesive. The supramolecular adhesive, which was obtained by random copolymerization of acrylamide and n&#8208;butyl acrylate, is amphiphilic, has a proper glass transition temperature and a high density of hydrogen&#8208;bond donors and receptors, providing the possibility of thermal dynamic repair of mechanical damage in FPSCs. The adhesive also greatly improves the leveling property of the precursor solution on the hydrophobic poly[bis(4&#8208;phenyl)(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)]amine (PTAA) surface. PSCs containing this adhesive achieve more than a 20&#8201;% power conversion efficiency (PCE) on flexible substrates and a 21.99&#8201;% PCE on rigid substrates (certified PCE of 21.27&#8201;%), with improved electron mobility and reduced defect concentration.

PSCs containing this adhesive achieve more than a 20&#8201;% power conversion efficiency (PCE) on flexible substrates and a 21.99&#8201;% PCE on rigid substrates (certified PCE of 21.27&#8201;%), with improved electron mobility and reduced defect concentration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biosynthetic Structural Proteins with Super Plasticity, Extraordinary Mechanical Performance, Biodegradability, Biocompatibility and Information Storage Ability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lysine&#8208;rich structural proteins were synthesized by a microbial system. The protein&#8208;based bioplastics showed super plasticity, extraordinary mechanical performance, desirable biodegradability, biocompatibility, structural stability, and data encoding ability. Information storage and hemostatic applications were realized in this new bioplastic system. This work offers a compelling prospect for developing a new generation of ecological materials.







Abstract
Degradable bioplastics have attracted growing interest worldwide. However, it is challenging to develop bioplastics with a simple processing procedure, strong mechanical performance, good biocompatibility, and adjustable physicochemical properties. Herein, we introduced structural proteins as building blocks and developed a simple environmentally friendly approach to fabricate diverse protein&#8208;based plastics. A cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;level production approach was developed through batch fermentation of Escherichia coli to produce the biomaterials. These bioplastics possess super plasticity, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and high resistance to organic solvents. Their structural and mechanical properties can be precisely controlled. Besides, high density information storage and hemostatic applications were realized in the bioplastic system. The customizable bioplastics have great potential for applications in numerous fields and are capable to scale up to the industrial level.

         <title>A Smart Theranostic Prodrug System Activated by Reactive Oxygen Species for Regional Chemotherapy of Metastatic Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;activated smart theranostic prodrug system for efficient regional chemotherapy of metastatic cancers has been developed. The prodrug can selectively target cancer cells and be activated by highly expressed ROS, rapidly releasing drug with high efficiency. It shows significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy towards metastatic cancers (up to 99.9&#8201;%) with no obvious side effects.







Abstract
Metastatic cancer is difficult to cure because of its uncontrollable nature and side effects during treatment. We constructed a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;activated smart theranostic prodrug system based on an ROS active site linked with both a targeting group and an anticancer drug for efficient regional chemotherapy of metastatic cancers. The optimized prodrug (Bio&#8208;(8)&#8208;MB&#8208;CPT) with biotin as the targeting group displayed high sensitivity towards ROS and selectively targeting ability towards cervical cancer cells, showing highly efficient drug release (up to 92&#8201;%) in vitro. Bio&#8208;(8)&#8208;MB&#8208;CPT thus exerted strong toxicity towards cervical cancer cells, but unlike the parent drug (camptothecin), showed no toxicity towards normal cells. Moreover, the prodrug displayed significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy in vivo and eradicated the tumor with no obvious side effects (inhibition of the tumor reached up to 99.9&#8201;%).

         <title>Engineering the Local Atomic Environments of Indium Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Efficient Electrochemical Production of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coordination engineering strategy based on a p&#8208;block In single&#8208;atom catalyst with N,S&#8208;dual first coordination and B second coordination on hollow carbon rods (In SAs/NSBC) has been developed. DFT results and electrochemical analysis show a superior 2&#8201;e&#8722; oxygen reduction performance of the In SAs/NSBC catalyst in alkaline and neutral solutions, which is ascribed to synergistic effects between first&#8208;coordinated N/S, second&#8208;coordinated B, and single In atoms.







Abstract
The in&#8208;depth understanding of local atomic environment&#8211;property relationships of p&#8208;block metal single&#8208;atom catalysts toward the 2&#8201;e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has rarely been reported. Here, guided by first&#8208;principles calculations, we develop a heteroatom&#8208;modified In&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework&#8208;assisted approach to accurately synthesize an optimal catalyst, in which single In atoms are anchored by combined N,S&#8208;dual first coordination and B second coordination supported by the hollow carbon rods (In SAs/NSBC). The In SAs/NSBC catalyst exhibits a high H2O2 selectivity of above 95&#8201;% in a wide range of pH. Furthermore, the In SAs/NSBC&#8208;modified natural air diffusion electrode exhibits an unprecedented production rate of 6.49&#8197;mol peroxide&#8201;gcatalyst&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in 0.1&#8197;M KOH electrolyte and 6.71&#8197;mol&#8201;peroxide&#8201;gcatalyst&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in 0.1&#8197;M PBS electrolyte. This strategy enables the design of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance single&#8208;atom materials, and provides practical guidance for H2O2 electrosynthesis.

A series of rotaxane&#8208;based catalysts in which the mechanical bond between a bipyridine macrocycle and an NDI&#8208;containing axle is intrinsic to their activity is reported. Computational analysis suggests that the high selectivity observed (&gt;60 fold for Michael addition over a competing decarboxylation pathway) is due to &#960;&#8208;stacking of the mechanically bonded components that leads to high polarizability.







Abstract
We report a series of rotaxane&#8208;based anion&#8211;&#960; catalysts in which the mechanical bond between a bipyridine macrocycle and an axle containing an NDI unit is intrinsic to the activity observed, including a [3]rotaxane that catalyses an otherwise disfavoured Michael addition in &gt;60 fold selectivity over a competing decarboxylation pathway that dominates under Br&#248;nsted base conditions. The results are rationalized by detailed experimental investigations, electrochemical and computational analysis.

         <title>Gold (I/III)&#8208;Catalyzed Trifluoromethylthiolation and Trifluoromethylselenolation of Organohalides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first gold(I/III)&#8208;catalyzed direct trifluoromethylthiolation and trifluoromethylselenolation of organohalides are reported. This mild and efficient protocol enjoys a broad substrate scope and high yield (&gt;60 examples with up to 97&#8201;% isolated yield). Its robustness was demonstrated by the late&#8208;stage functionalization of various bioactive molecules, which makes this reaction applicable to pharmaceutical and agrochemical research and development.







Abstract
The first C&#8722;SCF3/SeCF3 cross&#8208;coupling reactions using gold redox catalysis [(MeDalphos)AuCl], AgSCF3 or Me4NSeCF3, and organohalides as substrates are reported. The new methodology enables a one&#8208;stop shop synthesis of aryl/alkenyl/alkynyl trifluoromethylthio&#8208; and selenoethers with a broad substrate scope (&gt;60 examples with up to 97&#8201;% isolated yield). The method is scalable, and its robustness is evidenced by the late&#8208;stage functionalization of various bioactive molecules, which makes this reaction an attractive alternative in the synthesis of trifluoromethylthio&#8208; and selenoethers for pharmaceutical and agrochemical research and development.

         <title>Internal Electric Field and Interfacial Bonding Engineered Step&#8208;Scheme Junction for a Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Involved Lithium&#8211;Oxygen Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The internal electric field and interfacial Fe&#8722;N bonding in S&#8208;scheme Fe2O3/C3N4 significantly boosts the separation and directional migration of photo&#8208;excited carriers to establish spatially isolated redox centers. These enable the light&#8208;involved Li&#8211;O2 battery with a Fe2O3/C3N4 cathode to present an elevated discharge voltage of 3.13&#8197;V under illumination and a charge voltage of 3.19&#8197;V, as well as superior rate capability and cycling stability.







Abstract
Li&#8211;O2 batteries have aroused considerable interest in recent years, however they are hindered by high kinetic barriers and large overvoltages at cathodes. Herein, a step&#8208;scheme (S&#8208;scheme) junction with hematite on carbon nitride (Fe2O3/C3N4) is designed as a bifunctional catalyst to facilitate oxygen redox for a visible&#8208;light&#8208;involved Li&#8211;O2 battery. The internal electric field and interfacial Fe&#8722;N bonding in the heterojunction boost the separation and directional migration of photo&#8208;carriers to establish spatially isolated redox centers, at which the photoelectrons on C3N4 and holes on Fe2O3 remarkably accelerate the discharge and charge kinetics. These enable the Li&#8211;O2 battery with Fe2O3/C3N4 to present an elevated discharge voltage of 3.13&#8197;V under illumination, higher than the equilibrium potential 2.96&#8197;V in the dark, and a charge voltage of 3.19&#8197;V, as well as superior rate capability and cycling stability. This work will shed light on rational cathode design for metal&#8211;O2 batteries.

         <title>Spatially Confined Intervention of Cellular Senescence by a Lysosomal Metabolism Targeting Molecular Prodrug for Broad&#8208;Spectrum Senotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spatially confined prodrug activation strategy is reported as a new paradigm of senotherapy. The prodrug is designed to target the defective lysosome metabolism, a unique yet ubiquitous event during cellular senescence, instead of dynamically changing and highly heterogeneous senescence&#8208;related signaling pathways employed in conventional methods, thereby fulfilling robust specificity and broad&#8208;spectrum activity towards senescent cells.







Abstract
Specific intervention of senescent cells (SnCs) is emerging as a powerful means to counteract aging and age&#8208;related diseases. Canonical methods are generally designed to target SnC&#8208;associated signaling pathways, which are however dynamically changing and highly heterogeneous in SnCs, significantly limiting the effectiveness. Here, we present a tailor&#8208;made molecular prodrug targeting lysosome dysfunction, a unique feature shared by virtually all types of SnCs. The prodrug comprises three modules all targeting the altered lysosomal programs in SnCs, namely, a recognizing unit towards the elevated lysosome content, a linker cleavable by the activated lysosomal enzyme, and a lysosomotropic agent targeting the increased lysosomal membrane sensitivity. This spatially confined design enables killing broad&#8208;spectrum SnCs, with high specificity over non&#8208;SnCs. Along with in&#8197;vivo benefits, this work offers a way to significantly expand the applicability of senotherapy in a wide range of diseases.

         <title>A &#8220;Blockchain&#8221; Synergy in Conductive Polymer&#8208;Filled Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Dendrite&#8208;Free Li Plating/Stripping with High Coulombic Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel concept of &#8220;blockchain&#8221; matrix Li storage is proposed by utilizing the N&#8208;rich polypyrrole (PPy) as the &#8220;chain&#8221; to fill and interlink the &#8220;blocks&#8221; of MOF cavities. The lithiophilic PPy helps to guide fast infiltration/extrusion of Li+ ions and serve as the nucleation sites for isotropic Li deposition, while the MOF pores enable the compartmentalization of the otherwise bulk Li deposition and provide spatial confinement for accommodating 3D matrix Li storage.







Abstract
The performance of lithium&#8208;metal batteries is severely hampered by uncontrollable dendrite growth and volume expansion on the metal anodes. Inspired by the &#8220;blockchain&#8221; concept in data mining, here we utilize a conductive polymer&#8208;filled metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) as the lithium host, in which polypyrrole (PPy) serves as the &#8220;chain&#8221; to interlink Li &#8220;blocks&#8221; stored in the MOF pores. While the N&#8208;rich PPy guides fast Li+ infiltration/extrusion and serves as the nucleation sites for isotropic Li growth, the MOF pores compartmentalize bulk Li deposition for 3D matrix Li storage, leading to low&#8208;barrier and dendrite&#8208;free Li plating/stripping with superb Coulombic efficiency. The as&#8208;fabricated lithium&#8208;metal anodes operate over 700&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in symmetric cells, and 800 cycles at 1&#8197;C in full cells with a per&#8208;cycle capacity loss of only 0.017&#8201;%. This work might open a new chapter for Li&#8208;metal anode construction by introducing the concept of &#8220;blockchain&#8221; management of Li plating/stripping.

This work might open a new chapter for Li-metal anode construction by introducing the concept of &#8220;blockchain&#8221; management of Li plating/stripping.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Efficient Multiphoton Absorption of Zinc&#8208;AIEgen Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc&#8208;tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibit highly efficient multiphoton excited photoluminescence (MEPL) with concomitant third&#8208;harmonic generation (THG). MEPL parameters of the Zn&#8208;AIEgen hinged MOFs are far superior to some of the best multiphoton absorption (MPA) materials including the perovskite nanocrystals.







Abstract
A series of luminescent frameworks was synthesized from the selective combination of aggregation induced emission (AIE)&#8208;linker tetra&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxylphenyl)ethylene (H4TCPE) and Zn2+. Complex 1 was formed by the close packing of Zn&#8208;TCPE hinge, and isostructural complexes 2&#8211;5 were constructed by the linkage of Zn&#8208;TCPE layer and pillar ligands. These complexes exhibit highly efficient multiphoton excited photoluminescence (MEPL) and concomitant third&#8208;harmonic generation (THG). The multiphoton absorption (MPA) parameters of 1 are superior to other multiphoton emission materials including the perovskite nanocrystals. The incorporation of pillar linkers slows down the charge transfer between layers of Zn&#8208;TCPE, and the aromatic core of pillar linkers has a great influence on the MPA performance of the corresponding frameworks.

         <title>Modulating the Frontier Orbitals of an Aluminylene for Facile Dearomatization of Inert Arenes**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coordination of an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene at an electron&#8208;deficient aluminylene center can remarkably boost the redox property of the aluminylene via modulation of frontier orbitals. This allows for facile dearomatization of inert arenes via either [4+1] cycloadditions or cleavage of aromatic C&#8722;C bonds.







Abstract
Lewis bases are well known to stabilize electron&#8208;deficient species. We demonstrate herein that the redox property of a monocoordinated aluminylene 1 featuring only four valence electrons for the shell of Al can be boosted by a Lewis base. The coordination of 1 with an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) effectively shrinks the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, thereby enhancing the reactivity of the ensuing acyclic mono&#8208;NHC&#8208;stabilized aluminylene 2, which is isoelectronic with singlet carbenes. Moreover, such base coordination completely reverses the predominant chemical reactivity (i.e. electrophilicity/nucleophilicity) of aluminylenes. In marked contrast to 1, 2 readily undergoes a [4+1] cycloaddition reaction with naphthalene and biphenylene at room temperature. Strikingly, the enhanced ambiphilic nature of Al in 2 also enables facile cleavage of aromatic C&#8722;C bonds of inert arenes in both intra&#8208; and intermolecular fashion affording 3 and 5. The formation of 5 represents the first example of the cleavage of an aromatic C(3)&#8722;C(4) bond in biphenylene by a single&#8208;atom center.

         <title>Clusters Induced Electron Redistribution to Tune Oxygen Reduction Activity of Transition Metal Single&#8208;Atom for Metal&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy of metal clusters regulating metal single&#8208;atom sites is developed to boost the activities of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts (Fe, Co, Ni). Benefiting from the electron redistribution between active sites and substrate, the optimized catalyst exhibits remarkable activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.9&#8197;V vs. RHE and achieves high discharge voltages in various metal&#8211;air batteries.







Abstract
Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity can be effectively tuned by modulating the electron configuration and optimizing the chemical bonds. Herein, a general strategy to optimize the activity of metal single&#8208;atoms is achieved by the decoration of metal clusters via a coating&#8211;pyrolysis&#8211;etching route. In this unique structure, the metal clusters are able to induce electron redistribution and modulate M&#8722;N species bond lengths. As a result, M&#8208;ACSA@NC exhibits superior ORR activity compared with the nanoparticle&#8208;decorated counterparts. The performance enhancement is attributed to the optimized intermediates desorption benefiting from the unique electronic configuration. Theoretical analysis reinforces the significant roles of metal clusters by correlating the ORR activity with cluster&#8208;induced charge transfer. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, various metal&#8211;air batteries assembled with Fe&#8208;ACSA@NC deliver remarkable power densities and capacities. This strategy is an effective and universal technique for electron modulation of M&#8722;N&#8722;C, which shows great potential in application of energy storage devices.

         <title>Spin Crossover in a Cobalt Complex on Ag(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin&#8208;crossover is induced in self&#8208;assembled tetramers of a Co&#8208;complex on Ag(111) surfaces via the injection of electrons or holes with a scanning tunneling microscope. The resulting memristive current&#8211;voltage characteristic is analysed in terms of the electron transport through the molecular d&#8208;orbitals.







Abstract
The Co&#8208;based complex [Co(H2B(pz)(pypz))2] (py=pyridine, pz=pyrazole) deposited on Ag(111) was investigated with scanning tunneling microscopy at &#8776;5&#8197;K. Due to a bis(tridentate) coordination sphere the molecules aggregate mainly into tetramers. Individual complexes in these tetramers undergo reversible transitions between two states with characteristic image contrasts when current is passed through them or one of their neighbors. Two molecules exhibit this bistability while the other two molecules are stable. The transition rates vary linearly with the tunneling current and exhibit an intriguing dependence on the bias voltage and its polarity. We interpret the states as being due to S=1/2 and 3/2 spin states of the Co2+ complex. The image contrast and the orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude variations of the switching yields can be tentatively understood from the calculated orbital structures of the two spin states, thus providing first insights into the mechanism of electron&#8208;induced excited spin&#8208;state trapping (ELIESST).

A novel orthoquinone&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF)&#8722;BT&#8208;PTO COF cathode was designed and synthesized for aqueous zinc&#8211;organic batteries. The inherent ordered open channel structure facilitates ion transfer and insertion, thus making the COF follow a redox pseudocapacitance mechanism with staged Zn2+ H+ co&#8208;insertion behavior, ultra&#8208;fast kinetics and unprecedented cyclability.







Abstract
Elaborate molecular design on cathodes is of great importance for rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8211;organic batteries&#8217; performance elevation. Herein, we design a novel orthoquinone&#8208;based covalent organic framework with an ordered channel structures (BT&#8208;PTO COF) cathode for an ultrahigh performance aqueous zinc&#8211;organic battery. The ordered channel structure facilitates ions transfer and makes the COF follow a redox pseudocapacitance mechanism. Thus, it delivers a high reversible capacity of 225&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and an exceptional long&#8208;term cyclability (retention rate 98.0&#8201;% at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 (&#8776;18&#8197;C) after 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles). Moreover, a co&#8208;insertion mechanism with Zn2+ first followed by two H+ is uncovered for the first time. Significantly, this co&#8208;insertion behaviour evolves to more H+ insertion routes at high current density and gives the COF ultra&#8208;fast kinetics thus it achieves unprecedented specific power of 184&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1(COF) and a high energy density of 92.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1(COF). Our work reports a superior organic material for zinc batteries and provides a design idea for future high&#8208;performance organic cathodes.

         <title>Structures of Silver Fingers and a Pathway to Their Genotoxicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cooperative AgI binding to CCHH zinc fingers causes zinc ion release followed by a collapse of the stable secondary structure and formation of a highly stable Ag2S2 cluster. CCHC, CCCH and CCCC zinc fingers react analogously. Such silver&#8208;induced perturbation inhibits binding of the CCHH zinc finger protein to its cognate DNA sequence and as a consequence may affect many cellular processes including transcriptional regulation.







Abstract
Recently, we demonstrated that AgI can directly replace ZnII in zinc fingers (ZFs). The cooperative binding of AgI to ZFs leads to a thermodynamically irreversible formation of silver clusters destroying the native ZF structure. Thus, a reported loss of biological function of ZF proteins is a likely consequence of such replacement. Here, we report an X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) study of AgnSn clusters formed in ZFs to probe their structural features. Selective probing of the local environment around AgI by XAS showed the predominance of digonal AgI coordination to two sulfur donors, coordinated with an average Ag&#8722;S distance at 2.41&#8197;&#197;. No Ag&#8722;N bonds were present. A mixed AgS2/AgS3 geometry was found solely in the CCCH AgI&#8722;ZF. We also show that cooperative replacement of ZnII ions with the studied Ag2S2 clusters occurred in a three&#8208;ZF transcription factor protein 1MEY#, leading to a dissociation of 1MEY# from the complex with its cognate DNA.

         <title>Kinetics&#8208;Regulated Interfacial Selective Superassembly of Asymmetric Smart Nanovehicles with Tailored Topological Hollow Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile kinetics&#8208;regulated cooperative polymerization induced interfacial selective superassembly strategy is demonstrated to construct a series of asymmetric hollow porous composites with tunable diameters, topological architectures and components. Benefiting from the unique asymmetric hollow porous structure and photothermal effect, these nanoparticles are utilized as smart NIR light&#8208;triggered nanovehicles.







Abstract
Hollow nanoparticles featuring tunable structures with spatial and chemical specificity are of fundamental interest. However, it remains a significant challenge to design and synthesize asymmetric nanoparticles with controllable topological hollow architecture. Here, a versatile kinetics&#8208;regulated cooperative polymerization induced interfacial selective superassembly strategy is demonstrated to construct a series of asymmetric hollow porous composites (AHPCs) with tunable diameters, architectures and components. The size and number of patches on Janus nanoparticles can be precisely manipulated by the precursor and catalyst content. Notably, AHPCs exhibit excellent photothermal conversion performance under the irradiation of a near infrared (NIR) laser. Thus, AHPCs are utilized as NIR light&#8208;triggered nanovehicles and cargos can be controllably released. In brief, this versatile superassembly approach offers a streamlined and powerful toolset to design diverse asymmetric hollow porous composites.

A new class of rigid&#8211;flexible coupling crystalline crosslinked polymers is fabricated for the first time. The polymers can form self&#8208;standing membranes showing outstanding vapomechanically responsive performance.







Abstract
Fabricating mechanically responsive actuators that can efficiently convert external stimuli into mechanical work is of great significance for real&#8208;world applications. Herein, we rationally design a class of rigid&#8211;flexible coupling crystalline crosslinked polymers (CCPs) to fabricate vapomechanically responsive actuators. Interfacial condensation reactions of flexible macromers with rigid monomers afford a series of freestanding CCP membranes. Notably, it is the first example where crosslinked polymers show high crystallinity and porosity. Moreover, the CCP membranes exhibit good mechanical properties and interesting vapor&#8208;triggered actuation performance, which is reversible and repeatable. We find that the unusual polymer structures, high vapor sorption, and anisotropic membranes contribute to the directional deformation performance of the CCP actuators. The synthesis approach in this work provides new insights into the design and fabrication of smart materials for advanced applications.

         <title>Structural Insight into the Catalytic Mechanism of the Endoperoxide Synthase FtmOx1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ternary complex FtmOx1&#8901;2OG&#8901;fumitremorgin&#8197;B has been solved at a resolution of 1.22&#8197;&#197;, providing an accurate structural basis for the mechanistic study of endoperoxide formation. The binding conformation of fumitremorgin&#8197;B in this structure is different from any previously docked structures. Structural analysis and multiscale calculations revealed that Y68 radical is key to endoperoxidation.







Abstract
The 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG)&#8208;dependent non&#8208;heme enzyme FtmOx1 catalyzes the endoperoxide biosynthesis of verruculogen. Although several mechanistic studies have been carried out, the catalytic mechanism of FtmOx1 is not well determined owing to the lack of a reliable complex structure of FtmOx1 with fumitremorgin&#8197;B. Herein we provide the X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the ternary complex FtmOx1&#8901;2OG&#8901;fumitremorgin&#8197;B at a resolution of 1.22&#8197;&#197;. Our structures show that the binding of fumitremorgin&#8197;B induces significant compression of the active pocket and that Y68 is in close proximity to C26 of the substrate. Further MD simulation and QM/MM calculations support a CarC&#8208;like mechanism, in which Y68 acts as the H&#8197;atom donor for quenching the C26&#8208;centered substrate radical. Our results are consistent with all available experimental data and highlight the importance of accurate complex structures in the mechanistic study of enzymatic catalysis.

Further MD simulation and QM/MM calculations support a CarC-like mechanism, in which Y68 acts as the H&#8197;atom donor for quenching the C26-centered substrate radical. Our results are consistent with all available experimental data and highlight the importance of accurate complex structures in the mechanistic study of enzymatic catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Harvesting Fluorescent Spherical Nucleic Acids Self&#8208;Assembled from a DNA&#8208;Grafted Conjugated Polymer for Amplified Detection of Nucleic Acids</title>

         <dc:description>
A new kind of amphiphilic DNA&#8208;grafted conjugated polymer (PFBT&#8208;g&#8208;DNA) is synthesized and assembles into fluorescent spherical nucleic acids (FCP&#8208;SNAs) with excellent light&#8208;harvesting capability. Since the FCP&#8208;SNAs can efficiently &#8220;pump&#8221; the collected energy to the receptor, showing exceptional signal transduction ability, they are applied to detect the ultralow concentration of nucleic acid down to 1.7&#8197;pM.







Abstract
The ultralow concentration of nucleic acids in complex biological samples requires fluorescence probes with high specificity and sensitivity. Herein, a new kind of spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) is developed by using fluorescent &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (FCPs) as a light&#8208;harvesting antenna to enhance the signal transduction of nucleic acid detection. Specifically, amphiphilic DNA&#8208;grafted FCPs are synthesized and self&#8208;assemble into FCP&#8208;SNA structures. Tuning the hydrophobicity of the graft copolymer can adjust the size and light&#8208;harvesting capability of the FCP&#8208;SNAs. We observe that more efficient signal amplification occurs in larger FCP&#8208;SNAs, as more chromophores are involved, and the energy transfer can go beyond the F&#246;rster radius. Accordingly, the optimized FCP&#8208;SNA shows an antenna effect of up to 37&#8208;fold signal amplification and the limit of detection down to 1.7&#8197;pM in microRNA detection. Consequently, the FCP&#8208;SNA is applied to amplified in situ nucleic acid detecting and imaging at the single&#8208;cell level.

         <title>p&#8211;d Orbital Hybridization Induced by a Monodispersed Ga Site on a Pt3Mn Nanocatalyst Boosts Ethanol Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The monodispersed Ga site tailored Pt3Mn nanocatalyst based on high&#8208;indexed facets was constructed and shows excellent EOR performance with high activity and selectivity towards the C2 reaction pathway, which was attributed to the unconventional p&#8211;d orbital hybridization and atomic&#8208;level interface synergy.







Abstract
Constructing monodispersed metal sites in heterocatalysis is an efficient strategy to boost their catalytic performance. Herein, a new strategy using monodispersed metal sites to tailor Pt&#8208;based nanocatalysts is addressed by engineering unconventional p&#8211;d orbital hybridization. Thus, monodispersed Ga on Pt3Mn nanocrystals (Ga&#8208;O&#8208;Pt3Mn) with high&#8208;indexed facets was constructed for the first time to drive ethanol electrooxidation reaction (EOR). Strikingly, the Ga&#8208;O&#8208;Pt3Mn nanocatalyst shows an enhanced EOR performance with achieving 8.41&#8197;times of specific activity than that of Pt/C. The electrochemical in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results and theoretical calculations disclose that the Ga&#8208;O&#8208;Pt3Mn nanocatalyst featuring an unconventional p&#8211;d orbital hybridization not only promote the C&#8722;C bond&#8208;breaking and rapid oxidation of &#8208;OH of ethanol, but also inhibit the generation of poisonous CO intermediate species. This work discloses a promising strategy to construct a novel nanocatalysts tailored by monodispersed metal site as efficient fuel cell catalysts.

A Fe/Mn dual single&#8208;atom catalyst with an excellent bifunctional activity is prepared as the cathode for a flexible low&#8208;temperature Zn&#8208;air battery (ZAB). Profiting from the combined Fe/Mn dual&#8208;site effect as well as the porous 2D nanosheet structure, the ZAB could operate efficiently at the ultra&#8208;low temperature of &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Herein, a novel dual single&#8208;atom catalyst comprising adjacent Fe&#8208;N4 and Mn&#8208;N4 sites on 2D ultrathin N&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets with porous structure (FeMn&#8208;DSAC) was constructed as the cathode for a flexible low&#8208;temperature Zn&#8208;air battery (ZAB). FeMn&#8208;DSAC exhibits remarkable bifunctional activities for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Control experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal that the catalytic activity arises from the cooperative effect of the Fe/Mn dual&#8208;sites aiding *OOH dissociation as well as the porous 2D nanosheet structure promoting active sits exposure and mass transfer during the reaction process. The excellent bifunctional activity of FeMn&#8208;DSAC enables the ZAB to operate efficiently at ultra&#8208;low temperature of &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, delivering 30&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 peak power density and retaining up to 86&#8201;% specific capacity from the room temperature counterpart.

         <title>Light&#8208;Assisted CO2 Hydrogenation over Pd3Cu@UiO&#8208;66 Promoted by Active Sites in Close Proximity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Pd3Cu nanoparticles encapsulated into a MOF affording Pd3Cu@UiO&#8208;66 exhibits excellent performance in CO2 hydrogenation enhanced by light irradiation. Photo&#8208;generated electrons migrate from the linkers to activate CO2 adsorbed on Zr&#8211;oxo clusters. Then activated CO2 accepts spillover H* from Pd3Cu to complete the conversion. Significantly, the Pd3Cu spatial position plays a critical role and UiO&#8208;66&#8208;confined Pd3Cu greatly promotes activity.







Abstract
CO2 hydrogenation to methanol has attracted great interest while suffering from low conversion and high energy input. Herein, tiny Pd3Cu nanoparticles are confined into a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), UiO&#8208;66, to afford Pd3Cu@UiO&#8208;66 for CO2 hydrogenation. Remarkably, it achieves a methanol production rate of 340&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 200&#8201;&#176;C and 1.25&#8197;MPa under light irradiation, far surpassing that in the dark. The photo&#8208;generated electron transfer from the MOF to antibonding orbitals of CO2* promotes CO2 activation and HCOO* formation. In addition, the Pd3Cu microenvironment plays a critical role in CO2 hydrogenation. In contrast to the MOF&#8208;supported Pd3Cu (Pd3Cu/UiO&#8208;66), the Pd3Cu@UiO&#8208;66 exhibits a much higher methanol production rate due to the close proximity between CO2 and H2 activation sites, which greatly facilitates their interaction and conversion. This work provides a new avenue to the integration of solar and thermal energy for efficient CO2 hydrogenation under moderate conditions.

         <title>Vanadium&#8208;Incorporated CoP2 with Lattice Expansion for Highly Efficient Acidic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust V&#8722;CoP2 porous nanowire was fabricated by incorporating vanadium into a CoP2 lattice. The V incorporation results in an upshift of the d&#8208;band center, boosting HER activity. Meanwhile, V promotes the generation of a thicker Co3O4 layer with an oxygen vacancy that enhances the acidic OER stability. It presents a low voltage (1.47&#8197;V@10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and remarkable stability toward acidic water splitting.







Abstract
A proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) in acidic medium is a hopeful scenario for hydrogen production using renewable energy, but the grand challenge lies in substituting noble&#8208;metal catalysts. Herein, a robust electrocatalyst of V&#8722;CoP2 porous nanowires arranged on a carbon cloth is successfully fabricated by incorporating vanadium into the CoP2 lattice. Structural characterizations and theoretical analysis indicate that lattice expansion of CoP2 caused by V incorporation results in the upshift of the d&#8208;band center, which is conducive to hydrogen adsorption for boosting the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Besides, V promotes surface reconstruction to generate a thicker Co3O4 layer with an oxygen vacancy that enhances acid&#8208;corrosion resistance and optimizes the adsorption of water and oxygen&#8208;containing species, thus improving activity and stability toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Accordingly, it presents a superior acidic overall water splitting activity (1.47&#8197;V@10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) to Pt&#8722;C/CC||RuO2/CC (1.59&#8197;V@10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and remarkable stability. This work proposes a new route to design efficient non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalysts for PEMWE.

         <title>Deeper Insight into the Role of Organic Ammonium Cations in Reducing Surface Defects of the Perovskite Film</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new mechanism to understand the role of organic ammonium salt (OAS) in improving performances of perovskite solar cells is proposed. Besides passivating defects by itself, OAS also augments the passivation effect of excess PbI2 on the surface of the perovskite film by dispersing it into a discontinuous layer. Furthermore, using PbI2 nanosheets fully dispersed in advance boosts the efficiency to 23.14&#8201;%.







Abstract
Organic ammonium salts (OASs) have been widely used to passivate perovskite defects. The passivation mechanism is usually attributed to coordination of OASs with unpaired lead or halide ions, yet ignoring their interaction with excess PbI2 on the perovskite film. Herein, we demonstrate that OASs not only passivate defects by themselves, but also redistribute excess aggregated PbI2 into a discontinuous layer, augmenting its passivation effect. Moreover, alkyl OAS is more powerful to disperse PbI2 than a F&#8208;containing one, leading to better passivation and device efficiency because F atoms restrict the intercalation of OAS into PbI2 layers. Inspired by this mechanism, exfoliated PbI2 nanosheets are adopted to provide better dispersity of PbI2, further boosting the efficiency to 23.14&#8201;%. Our finding offers a distinctive understanding of the role of OASs in reducing perovskite defects, and a route to choosing an OAS passivator by considering substitution effects rather than by trial and error.

         <title>Molecular Dipole&#8208;Induced Photoredox Catalysis for Hydrogen Evolution over Self&#8208;Assembled Naphthalimide Nanoribbons</title>

The D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type 4&#8208;((9&#8208;phenylcarbazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)ethynyl)&#8208;N&#8208;dodecyl&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide (CZNI) with a large dipole moment of 8.49&#8197;D was smartly designed and synthesized to fabricate self&#8208;assembled CZNI nanoribbons for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production. It was revealed that the molecular dipole field could significantly reduce the exciton binding energy of the organic semiconductor and drive exciton dissociation to free charges for reducing protons to H2.







Abstract
D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type 4&#8208;((9&#8208;phenylcarbazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)ethynyl)&#8208;N&#8208;dodecyl&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide (CZNI) with a large dipole moment of 8.49&#8197;D and A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type bis[(4,4&#8242;&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide)&#8208;N&#8208;dodecyl]ethyne (NINI) with a negligible dipole moment of 0.28&#8197;D, were smartly designed and synthesized to demonstrate the evidence of a molecular dipole as the dominant mechanism for controlling charge separation of organic semiconductors. In aqueous solution, these two novel naphthalimides can self&#8208;assemble to form nanoribbons (NRs) that present significantly different traces of exciton dissociation dynamics. Upon photoexcitation of NINI&#8208;NRs, no charge&#8208;separated excitons (CSEs) are formed due to the large exciton binding energy, accordingly there is no hydrogen evolution. On the contrary, in the photoexcited CZNI&#8208;NRs, the initial bound Frenkel excitons are dissociated to long&#8208;lived CSEs after undergoing ultrafast charge transfer within ca. 1.25&#8197;ps and charge separation within less than 5.0&#8197;ps. Finally, these free electrons were injected into Pt co&#8208;catalysts for reducing protons to H2 at a rate of ca. 417&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, correspondingly an apparent quantum efficiency of ca. 1.3&#8201;% can be achieved at 400&#8197;nm.

         <title>CLIPON: A CRISPR&#8208;Enabled Strategy that Turns Commercial Pregnancy Test Strips into General Point&#8208;of&#8208;Need Test Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By rational integration of the human chorionic gonadotropin, CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a/crRNA system, and large&#8208;sized DNA assemblies, a portable sensing platform termed CLIPON has been developed, which can transduce both nucleic acid and non&#8208;nucleic acid targets into commercial pregnancy test strip readout. The detection is sensitive, selective, instrument&#8208;free, and allows future integration into a microchip.







Abstract
Desirable biosensing assays need to be sensitive, specific, cost&#8208;effective, instrument&#8208;free, and versatile. Herein we report a new strategy termed CLIPON (CRISPR and Large DNA assembly Induced Pregnancy strips for signal&#8208;ON detection) that can deliver these traits. CLIPON integrates a commercial pregnancy test strip (PTS) with four biological elements: the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a, crRNA and cauliflower&#8208;like large&#8208;sized DNA assemblies (CLD). CLIPON uses the Cas12a/crRNA complex both to recognize a target of interest and to release CLD&#8208;bound hCG so that target presence can translate into a colorimetric signal on the PTS. We demonstrate the versatility of CLIPON through sensitive and specific detection of HPV genomic DNA, SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genomic RNA and adenosine. We also engineer a cell phone app and a hand&#8208;held microchip to achieve signal quantification. CLIPON represents an attractive option for biosensing and point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective and Chemodivergent Allenylic Alkylation of Vinyl Azides for the Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Allenylic Amides and Ketones**

The first enantioselective allenylic alkylation of unstabilized enolates is enabled by cooperative iridium and Lewis acid catalysis using vinyl azide as an amide and ketone enolate surrogate. Utilizing racemic allenylic alcohols as the alkylating agent, these desiccant&#8208;controlled chemodivergent fragment&#8208;coupling reactions proceed through a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DyKAT) and deliver &#945;&#8208;allenylic amides and ketones with up to &gt;99.9&#8201;:&#8201;0.1 e.r.







Abstract
The first enantioselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;allenylic amides and ketones through allenylic alkylation of vinyl azides is reported. In these chemodivergent reactions, cooperatively catalyzed by a IrI/(phosphoramidite,olefin) complex and Sc(OTf)3, vinyl azides act as the surrogate for both amide enolates and ketone enolates. The desiccant (molecular sieves) plays a crucial role in controlling the chemodivergency of this enantioconvergent and regioselective reaction: Under otherwise identical reaction conditions, the presence of the desiccant led to &#945;&#8208;allenylic amides, while its absence resulted in &#945;&#8208;allenylic ketones. Utilizing racemic allenylic alcohols as the alkylating agent, the overall process represents a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DyKAT), where both the products are formed with the same absolute configuration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of the use of vinyl azide as the ketone enolate surrogate in an enantioselective transformation.

         <title>Picking on Carbonate: Kinetic Selectivity in the Encapsulation of Anions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hexapodal capsule has been shown to trap inorganic anions over a large span of time. Whereas small spherical and cylindrical ions enter the cage at a rapid rate (seconds), it takes longer (minutes) for medium&#8208;sized and tripodal species, and larger and tetrahedral anions need hours to days to fully populate the host. Such a kinetic selection could be used for sequestering anions from solution and/or controlling their chemistry.







Abstract
Supramolecular hosts bind to inorganic anions at a fast rate and select them in proportion with thermodynamic stability of the corresponding [anion&#8834;host] complexes, forming in a reversible manner. In this study, we describe the action of hexapodal capsule 1 and its remarkable ability to select anions based on a large span of rates by which they enter this host. The thermodynamic affinity of 1 toward eighteen anions extends over eight orders of magnitude (0&lt;Ka&lt;108&#8197;M&#8722;1; 1H NMR spectroscopy). The capsule would retain CO32&#8722; (Ka=107&#8197;M&#8722;1) for hours in the presence of eleven competing anions, including stronger binding SO42&#8722;, HAsO42&#8722; and HPO42&#8722; (Ka=107&#8211;108&#8197;M&#8722;1). The observed selection resulted from 1 possessing narrow apertures (ca. 3&#215;6&#8197;&#197;) comparable in size to anions (d=3.5&#8211;7.1&#8197;&#197;) slowing down the encapsulation to last from seconds to days. The unorthodox mode of action of 1 sets the stage for creating hosts that pick anions by their ability to access the host.

         <title>Chemiluminescent 1,2&#8208;Dioxetane Iridium Complexes for Near&#8208;Infrared Oxygen Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iridium(III)&#8208;based chemiluminescent oxygen sensors are described. Energy transfer from the chemiexcited benzoate to the oxygen&#8208;sensitive IrIII sub&#8208;unit results in emission in the near&#8208;infrared region. The corresponding O2&#8208;dependent responses have been exploited for achieving in vitro O2 imaging as well as live animal imaging.







Abstract
Chemiluminescent iridium&#8208;based sensors which demonstrate oxygen&#8194;dependent responses have been developed. The molecular probes, named IrCL&#8208;1, IrCL&#8208;2 and IrCL&#8208;3 consist of oxygen&#8208;sensitive iridium complexes attached to a spiroadamantane 1,2&#8194;dioxetane and operate via energy transfer from the chemiexcited benzoate to the corresponding iridium(III) complex. Complexing the iridium(III) center with &#960;&#8208;extended ligands results in emission in the biologically relevant, near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region. All probes demonstrate varying oxygen tolerance, with IrCL&#8208;1 being the most oxygen sensitive. These probes have been further utilized for in vitro ratiometric imaging of oxygen, as well as for intraperitoneal, intramuscular and intratumoral imaging in live mice. To our knowledge, these are the first iridium&#8208;based chemiluminescent probes that have been employed for in vitro ratiometric oxygen sensing, and for in vivo tumor imaging.

A series of metalloporphyrin covalent organic framework based nanosheets has been synthesized and successfully applied in specific sensing of NO2 at room temperature.







Abstract
2D nanomaterials with flexibly modifiable surfaces are highly sought after for various applications, especially in room&#8208;temperature chemiresistive gas sensing. Here, we have prepared a series of COF 2D nanomaterials (porphyrin&#8208;based COF nanosheets (NS)) that enabled highly sensitive and specific&#8208;sensing of NO2 at room temperature. Different from the traditional 2D sensing materials, H2&#8208;TPCOF was designed with a largely reduced interlayer interaction and predesigned porphyrin rings as modifiable sites on its surfaces for post&#8208;metallization. After post&#8208;metallization, the metallized M&#8208;TPCOF (M=Co and Cu) showed remarkably improved sensing performances. Among them, Co&#8208;TPCOF exhibited highly specific sensing toward NO2 with one of the highest sensitivities of all reported 2D materials and COF materials, with an ultra&#8208;low limit&#8208;of&#8208;detection of 6.8&#8197;ppb and fast response/recovery. This work might shed light on designing and preparing a new type of surface&#8208;highly&#8208;modifiable 2D material for various chemistry applications.

Multifaceted metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) can act as a food truck to adsorb, store, and deliver toxic gases to organic reactions. We showcase the versatility of MOFs by employing them as a safe&#8208;delivery tool, while simultaneously catalyzing organic reactions, producing yields and conversions that are comparable to the reactions utilizing the toxic gases directly.







Abstract
The efficient delivery of reactive and toxic gaseous reagents to organic reactions was studied using metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). The simultaneous cargo vehicle and catalytic capabilities of several MOFs were probed for the first time using the examples of aromatization, aminocarbonylation, and carbonylative Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reactions. These reactions highlight that MOFs can serve a dual role as a gas cargo vehicle and a catalyst, leading to product formation with yields similar to reactions employing pure gases. Furthermore, the MOFs can be recycled without sacrificing product yield, while simultaneously maintaining crystallinity. The reported findings were supported crystallographically and spectroscopically (e.g., diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy), foreshadowing a pathway for the development of multifunctional MOF&#8208;based reagent&#8208;catalyst cargo vessels for reactive gas reagents as an attractive alternative to the use of toxic pure gases or gas generators.

We present evidence that the dual emission of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;vinylimine boron compounds consisting of fluorescence and room temperature phosphorescence in solution is caused by the experimental artifact, where bright emission intensity saturates the detection dynamic range of the fluorimeter.







Abstract
A series of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;vinylimine boron compounds 1&#8211;7 have been reported to exhibit unique dual emission, consisting of fluorescence and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in solution. This finding triggered intensive research of RTP in &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;vinylimine boron derivatives. Herein, we show clear evidence that the associated dual emission, especially RTP, is caused by the experimental artifact, where bright emission intensity saturates the detection dynamic range of the fluorimeter.

A kinetics&#8208;regulated cooperative polymerization induced interfacial superassembly strategy is used by Biao Kong and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202200240) to construct a series of asymmetric hollow porous composites with tunable diameters, architectures, and compositions. Owing to their excellent photothermal conversion performance and unique nanostructures, the resulting nanoparticles can be utilized as NIR light triggered nanovehicles with controllable cargo release.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Nitric Acid from Nitrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) has drawn widespread attention due to its potential for the green synthesis of nitric acid. Since a prerequisite for the favorable development of this emerging field is the rational testing of NOR performance, a recommended protocol is presented in this Minireview. In addition, possible reaction mechanisms and future perspectives, as well as challenges related to NOR, are discussed.







Abstract
Nitric acid is widely applied in agriculture and industry. The present manufacturing process via a combination of the Haber&#8211;Bosch process and the Ostwald oxidation process is accompanied by massive energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The direct electrocatalytic nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) to nitric acid is a promising alternative, especially when it is driven by renewable energy sources. The standardization of performance evaluation is the prerequisite for the design and synthesis of efficient electrocatalysts for NOR. In this context, this Minireview first discusses the history of the development of HNO3 manufacturing and the possible reaction mechanisms for electrocatalytic NOR. Then, a strict protocol for electrochemical NOR experiments is recommended. Finally, general research targets associated with techno&#8208;economic analysis, challenges, and prospects for NOR are summarized for future studies.

Synthetic photoelectrochemistry (PEC) offers new prospects for the generation and handling of reactive intermediates. PEC permits selective single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) reactions in a much greener way and broadens the redox window of possible transformations. This Review discusses the combination of PEC with other reactivity paradigms, scalability up to multigram scale, novel selectivities in SET super&#8208;oxidations/reductions and the importance of precomplexation.







Abstract
Synthetic photoelectrochemistry (PEC) is receiving increasing attention as a new frontier for the generation and handling of reactive intermediates. PEC permits selective single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) reactions in a much greener way and broadens the redox window of possible transformations. Herein, the most recent contributions are reviewed, demonstrating exciting new opportunities, namely, the combination of PEC with other reactivity paradigms (hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer, radical polar crossover, energy transfer sensitization), scalability up to multigram scale, novel selectivities in SET super&#8208;oxidations/reductions and the importance of precomplexation to temporally enable excited radical ion catalysis.

         <title>Dendritic Mesoporous Nanoparticles: Structure, Synthesis and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>

A comprehensive review on dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs) with radial pores is provided. Perspectives into their formation mechanisms, synthesis&#8211;structure&#8211;property relationships and future research directions with a focus on biomedical applications are presented.







Abstract
Recently, dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles with widespread applications have attracted great interest. Despite many publications (&gt;800), the terminology &#8220;dendritic&#8221; is ambiguous. Understanding what possible &#8220;dendritic structures&#8221; are, their formation mechanisms and the underlying structure&#8211;property relationship is fundamentally important. With the advance of characterization techniques such as electron tomography, two types of tree&#8208;branch&#8208;like and flower&#8208;like structures can be distinguished, both described as &#8220;dendritic&#8221; in the literature. In this Review, we start with the definition of &#8220;dendritic&#8221;, then provide critical analysis of reported dendritic silica nanoparticles according to their structural classification. We update the understandings of the formation mechanisms of two types of &#8220;dendritic&#8221; nanoparticles, highlighting how to control their structural parameters. Applications of dendritic mesoporous nanoparticles are also reviewed with a focus on the biomedical field, providing new insights into the structure&#8211;property relationship in this family of nanomaterials.

         <title>Radical 1&#8208;Fluorosulfonyl&#8208;2&#8208;alkynylation of Unactivated Alkenes</title>

         <dc:description>
A radical transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free 1&#8208;fluorosulfonyl&#8208;2&#8208;alkynylation of unactivated alkenes with alkynyl sulfonyl fluorides as radical traps and FSO2&#8208;radical precursors is presented. The reaction features high atom economy, broad functional group tolerance, allows the synthesis of quaternary C&#8208;centers and installs a sulfonyl fluoride moiety, which can be conveniently diversified via SuFEx click chemistry.







Abstract
Sulfonyl fluorides have found widespread use in chemical biology and drug discovery. The development of synthetic methods for the introduction of the sulfonyl fluoride moiety is therefore of importance. Herein, a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free radical 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of unactivated alkenes via FSO2&#8208;radical addition with subsequent vicinal alkynylation to access &#946;&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;fluorosulfonylalkanes is presented. Alkynyl sulfonyl fluorides are introduced as highly valuable bifunctional radical trapping reagents that also serve as FSO2&#8208;radical precursors. The &#946;&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;fluorosulfonylalkanes obtained in these transformations can be readily diversified by using SuFEx click chemistry to obtain sulfonates and sulfonamides.

The phenyl carbamoylated guanidine (Ph&#8208;CG) group contributes to the efficient delivery of bioactive proteins in serum&#8208;containing media owing to substantially low pKa, increased hydrophobicity, enhanced hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction, and cellular entry.







Abstract
Despite the high potential of controlling cellular processes and treating various diseases by intracellularly delivered proteins, current delivery systems exhibit poor efficiency due to poor serum stability, cellular entry, and cytosolic availability of proteins. Here, we report a novel functional group, phenyl carbamoylated guanidine (Ph&#8208;CG), that greatly enhances the delivery efficiency to various types of cells. Owing to the substantially lowered pKa, the hydrophobic Ph&#8208;CG offers optimized inter&#8208;macromolecular interactions via enhanced hydrogen&#8208;bonding and hydrophobic interactions. The coplanarity of Ph&#8208;CG also leads to the better intracellular entry of protein complexes. Intracellularly delivered apoptosis&#8208;inducing enzymes and antibodies significantly induce cell viability inhibitions in a serum&#8208;containing medium. The newly developed Ph&#8208;CG can be introduced to various existing carriers, leading to the realization of future therapeutic protein delivery.

         <title>Electrochemical Fluorination of Vinyl Boronates through Donor&#8208;Stabilized Vinyl Carbocation Intermediates**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vinyl carbocations were generated via single&#8208;electron oxidation of alkenyl boronates using electrical potentials. This electrochemical process enabled the formation of these reactive species without the use of Lewis or Br&#248;nsted acids. The intermediate vinyl carbocations were trapped with nucleophilic fluoride sources to yield vinyl fluorides; the production of new C&#8722;C, C&#8722;Cl, and C&#8722;Br bonds was also demonstrated.







Abstract
The electrochemical generation of vinyl carbocations from alkenyl boronic esters and boronates is reported. Using easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle nucleophilic fluoride reagents, these intermediates are trapped to form fully substituted vinyl fluorides. Mechanistic studies support the formation of dicoordinated carbocations through sequential single&#8208;electron oxidation events. Notably, this electrochemical fluorination features fast reaction times and Lewis acid&#8208;free conditions. This transformation provides a complementary method to access vinyl fluorides with simple fluoride salts such as TBAF.

         <title>Rational Design of ZnMn2O4 Quantum Dots in a Carbon Framework for Durable Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZnMn2O4 quantum dots homogeneously embedded in a carbon framework (ZMO QD@C) are prepared by in&#8208;situ electrochemically inducing a Mn&#8208;MIL&#8208;100&#8208;derived precursor. Owing to the formation of Mn&#8722;O&#8722;C bonds at the interface between the ZMO QDs and the carbon matrix, the composite reveals superior cycling stability in a pure ZnSO4 electrolyte by inhibiting the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect and the disproportional reaction of the discharge product.







Abstract
Manganese oxides are promising cathode materials for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) due to their high energy density and low cost. However, in their discharging processes, the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect and Mn3+ disproportionation often lead to irreversible structural transformation and Mn2+ dissolution, deteriorating the cycling stability of ZIBs. Herein, ZnMn2O4 quantum dots (ZMO QDs) were introduced into a porous carbon framework by in&#8208;situ electrochemically inducing Mn&#8208;MIL&#8208;100&#8208;derived Mn3O4 quantum dots and the carbon composite. In such ZMO QDs and carbon composite, the quantum dot structure endows ZnMn2O4 with a shorter ion diffusion route and more active sites for Zn2+. The conductive carbon framework is beneficial to the fast transport of electrons. Furthermore, at the interface between the ZMO QDs and the carbon matrix, the Mn&#8722;O&#8722;C bonds are formed. They can effectively suppress the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect and manganese dissolution of discharge products. Therefore, Zn/ZMO QD@C batteries display remarkably enhanced electrochemical performance.

         <title>Transforming Electrocatalytic Biomass Upgrading and Hydrogen Production from Electricity Input to Electricity Output</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By coupling anodic low&#8208;potential furfural oxidation with the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction, a multipurpose electrocatalytic system was assembled for biomass upgrading, hydrogen production, and electricity generation. This system could generate about 2&#8197;kWh of electricity per cubic meter of H2 produced, instead of requiring electricity input.







Abstract
Integrating biomass upgrading and hydrogen production in an electrocatalytic system is attractive both environmentally and in terms of sustainability. Conventional electrolyser systems coupling anodic biosubstrate electrooxidation with hydrogen evolution reaction usually require electricity input. Herein, we describe the development of an electrocatalytic system for simultaneous biomass upgrading, hydrogen production, and electricity generation. In contrast to conventional furfural electrooxidation, the employed low&#8208;potential furfural oxidation enabled the hydrogen atom of the aldehyde group to be released as gaseous hydrogen at the anode at a low potential of approximately 0&#8197;VRHE (vs. RHE). The integrated electrocatalytic system could generate electricity of about 2&#8197;kWh per cubic meter of hydrogen produced. This study may provide a transformative technology to convert electrocatalytic biomass upgrading and hydrogen production from a process requiring electricity input into a process to generate electricity.

A phosphonate&#8208;containing cross&#8208;linker, tBu&#8208;PhoX, has been developed that efficiently permeates various biological membranes and can be robustly enriched using routine immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC). The optimized tBu&#8208;PhoX&#8208;based in&#8197;vivo cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry (XL&#8208;MS) system enables the time&#8208;efficient and detailed characterization of protein interaction landscapes in intact human cells.







Abstract
Cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry (XL&#8208;MS) is an attractive method for the proteome&#8208;wide characterization of protein structures and interactions. Currently, the depth of in&#8197;vivo XL&#8208;MS studies is lagging behind the established applications to cell lysates, because cross&#8208;linking reagents that can penetrate intact cells and strategies to enrich cross&#8208;linked peptides lack efficiency. To tackle these limitations, we have developed a phosphonate&#8208;containing cross&#8208;linker, tBu&#8208;PhoX, that efficiently permeates various biological membranes and can be robustly enriched using routine immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. We have established a tBu&#8208;PhoX&#8208;based in&#8197;vivo XL&#8208;MS approach that enables cross&#8208;links in intact human cells to be identified in high numbers with substantially reduced analysis time. Collectively, the developed cross&#8208;linker and XL&#8208;MS approach pave the way for the comprehensive XL&#8208;MS characterization of living systems.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Terpenoid&#8211;Pyrrolobenzoxazine Hybrid Natural Product CJ&#8208;12662</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthetic pathway of the terpene&#8211;amino acid hybrid CJ&#8208;12662 has been uncovered. In particular, the biosynthesis involves two different oxidation strategies (one&#8208;electron or two&#8208;electron oxidation routes) for the modification of each unit, reflecting its chemical reactivity. Finally, ThmM catalyzes the formation of the N&#8208;oxide, which undergoes a [1,2]&#8208;Meisenheimer rearrangement to form the unique pyrrolobenzoxazine structure.







Abstract
The fungal natural product CJ&#8208;12662 is a structurally complex terpene&#8211;amino acid hybrid, and is a potent anthelmintic compound. The biosynthetic pathway of CJ&#8208;12662 is elucidated based on metabolite analysis from heterologous expression. We demonstrate the terpene portion is derived from successive P450&#8208;catalyzed oxidations of amorpha&#8208;4,11&#8208;diene, while three flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes are involved in morphing the esterified tryptophan into a chlorinated pyrrolobenzoxazine, utilizing a cascaded [1,2]&#8208;Meisenheimer rearrangement.

         <title>Functional Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Acetylene Batteries for Electricity Generation and Electrochemical Acetylene Reduction to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel aqueous Zn&#8211;C2H2 battery is reported, which not only switches energy&#8208;consuming acetylene removal to electricity generation, but also reduces acetylene to ethylene through a unique discharge mechanism: C2H2+Zn+H2O&#8594;C2H4+ZnO. The Zn&#8211;C2H2 battery under a pure acetylene stream manifests an open&#8208;circuit potential of 1.14&#8197;V and a peak power density of 2.2&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. For crude ethylene, the Zn&#8211;C2H2 battery produces polymer&#8208;grade ethylene.







Abstract
The available processes for removing acetylene impurities from crude ethylene are tremendously energy&#8208;intensive. Herein, we demonstrate a novel aqueous Zn&#8211;C2H2 battery, which not only switches energy&#8208;consuming acetylene removal to electricity generation, but also reduces acetylene to ethylene through a unique discharge mechanism: C2H2+Zn+H2O&#8594;C2H4+ZnO. Under a pure acetylene stream, this Zn&#8211;C2H2 battery exhibits an open circuit potential of 1.14&#8197;V and a peak power density of 2.2&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which exceed those of reported Zn&#8211;CO2 batteries. Even for simulated crude ethylene, the Zn&#8211;C2H2 battery manifests an acetylene conversion of 99.97&#8201;% and continuously produces polymer&#8208;grade ethylene with only &#8776;3&#8197;ppm acetylene during a long&#8208;term discharge operation. Such a functional battery is universally appliable for reducing other alkynes and generating electricity. Therefore, this work provides an effective strategy for green ethylene purification and the design of functional batteries.

         <title>Protein&#8211;Protein Communication Mediated by an Antibody&#8208;Responsive DNA Nanodevice**

         <dc:description>
Inspired by the highly regulated networks of living systems, two antibody&#8208;responsive DNA&#8208;based devices are proposed that enable communication between two otherwise non&#8208;interacting proteins.







Abstract
We report here the rational design and optimization of an antibody&#8208;responsive, DNA&#8208;based device that enables communication between pairs of otherwise non&#8208;interacting proteins. The device is designed to recognize and bind a specific antibody and, in response, undergo a conformational change that leads to the release of a DNA strand, termed the &#8220;translator,&#8221; that regulates the activity of a downstream target protein. As proof of principle, we demonstrate antibody&#8208;induced control of the proteins thrombin and Taq DNA polymerase. The resulting strategy is versatile and, in principle, can be easily adapted to control protein&#8211;protein communication in artificial regulatory networks.

         <title>Accelerating Radiative Decay in Blue Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Emitters by Minimizing the Face&#8208;to&#8208;Face Donor&#8211;Acceptor Distances</title>

         <dc:description>
Thermally activated delayed fluorophores are constructed with strong through&#8208;space donor&#8211;acceptor interactions by minimizing their face&#8208;to&#8208;face distance of 2.7&#8211;2.8&#8197;&#197;, realizing efficient blue emission and fast radiative decay. The materials show maximum external quantum efficiencies of 27.8&#8201;% and 34.7&#8201;% with relieved efficiency roll&#8208;off and CIEy coordinates of 0.29 and 0.15, when used as emitter and sensitizer in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.







Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorophors (TADF) featuring through&#8208;space charge transfers (TSCT) suffer from low radiative decay rates (krs), especially for blue emitters. Here, a xanthene bridge is adopted to construct space&#8208;confined face&#8208;to&#8208;face donor&#8211;acceptor alignment and minimize their distances down to 2.7&#8211;2.8&#8197;&#197;, even shorter than the interlayer distance of graphite and thus strengthening the electronic interactions. The resulting blue TSCT&#8208;TADF emitters exhibit peaks around &#8776;460&#8197;nm, photoluminescence quantum yields of &gt;90&#8201;%, and krs of nearly 107&#8197;s&#8722;1, almost 2&#8211;10&#8197;times higher than previously observed values with comparable reverse intersystem crossing rates. The corresponding blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes show maximum external quantum efficiencies of 27.8&#8201;% and 34.7&#8201;% with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage y coordinates of 0.29 and 0.15 using those molecules as emitters and sensitizers, respectively.

         <title>A Chemical Biology Toolbox Targeting the Intracellular Binding Site of CCR9: Fluorescent Ligands, New Drug Leads and PROTACs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the intracellular CCR9 antagonist vercirnon, we developed the first small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based fluorescent ligand targeting the intracellular allosteric binding site (IABS) of a GPCR. This tool enabled binding studies via NanoBRET, fluorescence microscopy, and the discovery of a new intracellular CCR9 antagonist with improved affinity. To induce CCR9 degradation, we developed the first PROTAC targeting the IABS of GPCRs.







Abstract
A conserved intracellular allosteric binding site (IABS) has recently been identified at several G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs). Starting from vercirnon, an intracellular C&#8722;C chemokine receptor type 9 (CCR9) antagonist and previous phase III clinical candidate for the treatment of Crohn's disease, we developed a chemical biology toolbox targeting the IABS of CCR9. We first synthesized a fluorescent ligand enabling equilibrium and kinetic binding studies via NanoBRET as well as fluorescence microscopy. Applying this molecular tool in a membrane&#8208;based setup and in living cells, we discovered a 4&#8208;aminopyrimidine analogue as a new intracellular CCR9 antagonist with improved affinity. To chemically induce CCR9 degradation, we then developed the first PROTAC targeting the IABS of GPCRs. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study, we succeeded in showing that our CCR9&#8208;PROTAC is able to reduce CCR9 levels, thereby offering an unprecedented approach to modulate GPCR activity.

This tool enabled binding studies via NanoBRET, fluorescence microscopy, and the discovery of a new intracellular CCR9 antagonist with improved affinity. To induce CCR9 degradation, we developed the first PROTAC targeting the IABS of GPCRs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A conserved intracellular allosteric binding site (IABS) has recently been identified at several G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Starting from vercirnon, an intracellular C&#8722;C chemokine receptor type 9 (CCR9) antagonist and previous phase III clinical candidate for the treatment of Crohn's disease, we developed a chemical biology toolbox targeting the IABS of CCR9. We first synthesized a fluorescent ligand enabling equilibrium and kinetic binding studies via NanoBRET as well as fluorescence microscopy. Applying this molecular tool in a membrane-based setup and in living cells, we discovered a 4-aminopyrimidine analogue as a new intracellular CCR9 antagonist with improved affinity. To chemically induce CCR9 degradation, we then developed the first PROTAC targeting the IABS of GPCRs. In a proof-of-principle study, we succeeded in showing that our CCR9-PROTAC is able to reduce CCR9 levels, thereby offering an unprecedented approach to modulate GPCR activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Overlooked Pathway in 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloadditions of Diazoalkanes with Enamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The most popular illustration of the role of Frontier Molecular Orbitals (FMO) in 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions must be revised: the reactions of diazoacetates with enamines proceed stepwise and are controlled by interactions of the enamines&#8217; HOMO with &#960;*N=N (LUMO) and not with the unoccupied orbital of the heteropropargyl fragment (LUMO+1). Tautomers of the intermediate zwitterions have been observed and the mechanism studied by DFT computations.







Abstract
Methyl diazoacetate reacts with 1&#8208;(N&#8208;pyrrolidino)cycloalkenes to give products of 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions and azo couplings. The kinetics and mechanisms of these reactions were investigated by NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Orthogonal &#960;&#8208;systems in the 1,3&#8208;dipoles of the propargyl&#8208;allenyl type allow for two separate reaction pathways for the (3+2)&#8208;cycloadditions. The commonly considered concerted pathway is rationalized by the interaction of the enamine HOMO with LUMO+1, the lowest unoccupied orbital of the heteropropargyl anion fragment of methyl diazoacetate. We show that HOMO/LUMO(&#960;*N=N) interactions between enamines and methyl diazoacetate open a previously unrecognized reaction path for stepwise cycloadditions through zwitterionic intermediates with barriers approximately 40&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 lower in energy in CHCl3 (DFT calculations) than for the concerted path.

         <title>Unifying Scheme for the Biosynthesis of Acyl&#8208;Branched Sugars: Extended Substrate Scope of Thiamine&#8208;Dependent Enzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) of bacteria have branched sugars in their outer cell membrane with long, highly modified side chains. LPSs are often crucial factors in the pathogenesis of the bacteria. A unifying explanation of the biosynthesis of these highly interesting structures is introduced, based on the investigation of ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes responsible for the linkage of the side chain and the sugar core.







Abstract
Thiamine diphosphate (ThDP) dependent enzymes are useful catalysts for asymmetric C&#8722;C bond formation through benzoin&#8208;type condensation reactions that result in &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones. A wide range of aldehydes and ketones can be used as acceptor substrates; however, the donor substrate range is mostly limited to achiral &#945;&#8208;keto acids and simple aldehydes. By using a unifying retro&#8208;biosynthetic approach towards acyl&#8208;branched sugars, we identified a subclass of (myco)bacterial ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes with a greatly extended donor substrate range, namely functionalized chiral &#945;&#8208;keto acids with a chain length from C4 to C8. Highly enantioenriched acyloin products were obtained in good to high yields and several reactions were performed on a preparative scale. The newly introduced functionalized &#945;&#8208;keto acids, accessible by known aldolase&#8208;catalyzed transformations, substantially broaden the donor substrate range of ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes, thus enabling a more general use of these already valuable catalysts.

         <title>A Metal&#8208;Phenolic Nanosensitizer Performs Hydrogen Sulfide&#8208;Reprogrammed Oxygen Metabolism for Cancer Radiotherapy Intensification and Immunogenicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NIR&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;traced metal&#8208;phenolic nanosensitizer was developed that performed H2S&#8208;reprogrammed oxygen metabolism for radiotherapy intensification and immunogenicity. Hf&#8208;PSP&#8208;DTC@PLX nanoparticles generate H2S under an acidic tumor microenvironment to inhibit mitochondrial respiration and reprogram oxygen metabolism for tumor oxygenation. The chelated Hf ions simultaneously make full use of the preserved oxygen to improve the generation of local reactive oxygen species against tumor cells and to trigger antitumor immune activation.







Abstract
Radiotherapy (RT) is hampered by the limited oxygen in tumors, which could be potentiated via reprogramming the oxygen metabolism and increasing the oxygen utilization efficiency. Herein, a metal&#8208;phenolic nanosensitizer (Hf&#8208;PSP&#8208;DTC@PLX) was integrated via an acid&#8208;sensitive hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donor (polyethylene glycol&#8208;co&#8208;polydithiocarbamates, PEG&#8208;DTC) and a hafnium&#8208;chelated polyphenolic semiconducting polymer (Hf&#8208;PSP) in an amphiphilic polymer (poloxamer F127, PLX). Hf&#8208;PSP&#8208;DTC@PLX elicited a high imaging performance for precise RT and generated H2S to reduce the cellular oxygen consumption rate via mitochondrial respiration inhibition, which reprogrammed the oxygen metabolism for improvement of the tumor oxygenation. Then, Hf&#8208;sensitization could fully utilize the well&#8208;preserved oxygen to intensify RT efficacy and activate immunogenicity. Such a synergistic strategy for improvement of oxygenation and oxygen utilization would have great potential in optimizing oxygen&#8208;dependent therapeutics.

         <title>Selective Catalytic Oxidation of Methane to Methanol in Aqueous Medium over Copper Cations Promoted by Atomically Dispersed Rhodium on TiO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed Rh on TiO2 was used for the oxidation of methane to methanol with molecular oxygen under mild conditions. Promoted by copper cations, the Rh/TiO2 catalysts produced a millimole level of methanol with a selectivity higher than 99&#8201;%. Copper maintained the low&#8208;valence state of Rh. Moreover, copper acted as a scavenger for suppressing the overoxidation, thus leading to the high selectivity of methanol.







Abstract
Direct conversion of methane into value&#8208;added chemicals, such as methanol under mild conditions, is a promising route for industrial applications. In this work, atomically dispersed Rh on TiO2 suspended in an aqueous solution was used for the oxidation of methane to methanol. Promoted by copper cations (as co&#8208;catalyst) in solution, the catalysts exhibited high activity and selectivity for the production of methanol using molecular oxygen with the presence of carbon monoxide at 150&#8201;&#176;C with a reaction pressure of 31&#8197;bar. Millimole level yields of methanol were reached with the selectivity higher than 99&#8201;% using the Rh/TiO2 catalysts with the promotion of the copper cation. CO was the reductive agent to generate H2 from H2O, which led to the formation of H2O2 through the reaction of H2 and O2. Atomically dispersed Rh activated the C&#8722;H bond in CH4 and catalyzed the oxidation using H2O2. Copper cations maintained the low&#8208;valence state of Rh. Moreover, copper acted as a scavenger for suppressing the overoxidation, thus leading to the high selectivity of methanol.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromatic ammonium and phosphonium salts are important synthetic intermediates and multifunctional materials, but para&#8208;selective functionalization of the aromatic salts remains a challenge. Here we develop an ionic ligand based on our newly designed "biphenyl&#8208;phenanthroline" skeleton and realize the Ir&#8208;catalyzed para&#8208;selective C&#8208;H borylation of seven types of aromatic quaternary ammonium and phosphonium salts. Gram&#8208;scale transformation, late&#8208;stage elaboration for drug molecule, and diversification of borylated products demonstrate the potential utility of this reaction. The mechanistic studies and computational analysis elucidate the origin of para&#8208;selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Highly reduced Molybdenum Polyoxometalates via the Incorporation of d and f block metal ions.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The assembly of nanoscale polyoxometalate (POM) clusters has been dominated by  the highly reduced icosahedral {Mo  132  } &#8216;browns&#8217; and the toroidal {Mo  154  } &#8216;blues&#8217; which are 45% and 18% reduced respectively. We hypothesised that there is space for a greater diversity of structures in this immediate reduction zone. Here we show it is possible to make highly reduced mix&#8208;valence POMs by presenting new classes of polyoxomolybdates: [Mo  V  52  Mo  VI  12  H  26  O  200  ]  42&#8208;  {Mo  64  } and [Mo  V  40  Mo  VI  30  H  30  O  215  ]  20&#8208;  {Mo  70  }. The {Mo  64  } cluster archetype has a super&#8208;cube structure and is composed of five different types of building blocks, each arranged in overlayed Archimedean or Platonic polyhedra. The {Mo  70  } cluster comprises five tripodal {Mo  V  6  } and five tetrahedral {Mo  V  2  Mo  VI  2  } building blocks alternatively linked to form a loop with a pentagonal star topology. We also show how the reaction yielding the {Mo  64  } super&#8208;cube can be used in the enrichment of lanthanides which exploit the differences in selectivity in the self&#8208;assembly of the polyoxometalates.</dc:description>

         <title>A Practical Approach to Combine Modular Reactions and Reactionware for the Digitization of Chemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemistry digitization requires an unambiguous link between experiments and the code used to generate the experimental conditions and outcomes, yet this process is not standardized, limiting the portability of any chemical code. What is needed is a universal approach to aid this process using a well&#8208;defined standard that is composed of syntheses that are employed in modular hardware. Herein we present a new approach to the digitization of organic synthesis that combines process chemistry principles with 3D printed reactionware. This approach outlines the process for transforming unit operations into digitized hardware and well&#8208;defined instructions that ensure effective synthesis. To demonstrate this, we outline the process for digitizing 3 MIDA boronate building blocks, an ester hydrolysis, a Wittig olefination, a Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reaction, and synthesis of the drug sulfanilamide.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidase&#8208;type oxidation is an attractive strategy in organic synthesis due to the use of O  2  as the terminal oxidant. Organic photocatalysis can effect metal&#8208;free oxidase chemistry. Nevertheless, current methods are limited in reaction scope, possibly due to the lack of suitable photocatalysts. Here we report an isoquinoline&#8208;derived diaryl ketone&#8208;type photocatalyst, which has much enhanced absorption of blue and visible light compared to conventional diaryl ketones.  This photocatalyst enables d  ehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling of heteroarenes with unactivated and activated alkanes as well as aldehydes using air as the oxidant. A wide range of heterocycles with various functional groups are suitable substrates. Transient absorption and excited&#8208;state quenching experiments point to an unconventional mechanism that involves an excited state &#8220;self&#8208;quenching&#8221; process to generate the  N  &#8208;radical cation form of the sensitizer, which subsequently abstracts a hydrogen atom from the alkane substrate to yield a reactive alkyl radical.</dc:description>

         <title>A Water&#8208;soluble Highly Oxidizing Cobalt Molecular Catalyst Designed for Bioinspired Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present a stable water&#8208;soluble cobalt complex supported by a dianionic 2,2'&#8208;([2,2'&#8208;bipyridine]&#8208;6,6'&#8208;diyl)bis(propan&#8208;2&#8208;ol) ligand scaffold, which is a rare example of a high&#8208;oxidation species, as demonstrated by structural, spectroscopic and theoretical data. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and magnetic susceptibility measurements revealed that the Co  IV  center of the mononuclear complex in the solid state resides in the high (sextet, S = 5/2) spin state. The complex can effectively catalyze water oxidation via a single&#8208;site water nucleophilic attack pathway with an overpotential of only 360 mV in phosphate buffer with a pH of 6. The key intermediate toward water oxidation was speculated by theoretical calculations and was identified by in situ spectroelectrochemical experiments. The results are important to the accessibility of high&#8208;oxidation state metal species in synthetic models for achieving robust and reactive oxidation catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Pushing the Length Limit of Dihydrodiboraacenes: Synthesis and Characterizations of Boron&#8208;Embedded Heptacene and Nonacene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boron&#8208;embedded heteroacenes (boraacenes) have attracted enormous interest in organic chemistry and materials science. However, extending the skeleton of boraacenes to higher acenes (N &#8805; 6) is synthetically challenging because of their limited stability under ambient conditions. Herein, we report the synthesis of boron&#8208;embedded heptacene (  DBH  ) and nonacene (  DBN  ) as the hitherto longest boraacenes. The former is highly stable (even after 240 h in tetrahydrofuran) while the latter is air&#8208;sensitive with the half&#8208;life (  t  1/2  ) of 11.8 min. The structures of both compounds are verified by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, revealing a linear backbone with an antiaromatic C  4  B  2  core. Photophysical characterizations associated with theoretical calculations indicate that both compounds exhibit highly efficient anti&#8208;Kasha emissions. Remarkably, the air&#8208;stable  DBH  manifests an ultrahigh photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 98&#177;2% and can be chemically reduced to its radical anion and dianion states, implying the value of boron&#8208;doped higher acenes as novel functional materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state K&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes are key elements to address the current problems in K secondary batteries. Here, we report a sulfide&#8208;based K&#8208;ion conductor K  3  SbS  4  with a low activation energy of 0.27 eV. W&#8208;doped K  3&#8208;x  Sb  1&#8208;x  W  x  S  4  (x=0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.10 and 0.12) compounds were also explored for increasing vacancy concentrations and improving ionic conductivity. Among them, K  2.92  Sb  0.92  W  0.08  S  4  exhibits the highest conductivity of 1.4&#215;10  &#8208;4  S/cm at 40 &#176;C, which is among the best reported potassium ion conductors at ambient temperature. In addition, K  2.92  Sb  0.92  W  0.08  S  4  is electrochemical stable with long&#8208;chained potassium polysulfide of K  2  S  x  . A room&#8208;temperature solid potassium&#8208;sulfur (K&#8208;S) battery system has therefore been successfully demonstrated, which is the first K&#8208;S battery prototype using non&#8208;commercial inorganic&#8208;based electrolyte to block the polysulfide shuttle.</dc:description>

         <title>Combination of Knoevenagel Polycondensation and Water&#8208;Assisted Dynamic Michael&#8208;Addition&#8208;Elimination for the Synthesis of Vinylene&#8208;Linked 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinylene&#8208;linked two&#8208;dimensional conjugated covalent organic frameworks (V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs), belonging to the class of two&#8208;dimensional conjugated polymers, have attracted increasing attention due to their extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation over the 2D backbones associated with high chemical stability. The Knoevenagel polycondensation has been demonstrated as a robust synthetic method to provide cyano (CN)&#8208;substituted V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs with unique optoelectronic, magnetic, and redox properties. Despite the successful synthesis, it remains elusive for the relevant polymerization mechanism, which leads to relatively low crystallinity and poor reproducibility. In this work, we demonstrate the novel synthesis of CN&#8208;substituted V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs via the combination of Knoevenagel polycondensation and water&#8208;assisted dynamic Michael&#8208;addition&#8208;elimination, abbreviated as KMAE polymerization. The existence of C=C bond exchange between two diphenylacrylonitriles (M1 and M6) is firstly confirmed via in&#8208;situ high&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy study of model reactions. Notably, the intermediate M4 synthesized via Michael&#8208;addition can proceed the Michael&#8208;elimination quantitatively, leading to an efficient C=C bond exchange, unambiguously confirming the dynamic nature of Michael&#8208;addition&#8208;elimination. Furthermore, the addition of water can significantly promote the reaction rate of Michael&#8208;addition&#8208;elimination for highly efficient C=C bond exchange within 5 mins. As a result, the KMAE polymerization provides a highly efficient strategy for the synthesis of CN&#8208;substituted V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs with high crystallinity, as demonstrated by four examples of V&#8208;2D&#8208;COF&#8208;TFPB&#8208;PDAN, V&#8208;2D&#8208;COF&#8208;TFPT&#8208;PDAN, V&#8208;2D&#8208;COF&#8208;TFPB&#8208;BDAN, and V&#8208;2D&#8208;COF&#8208;HATN&#8208;BDAN, based on the simulated and experimental powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns as well as N2&#8208;adsorption&#8208;desorption measurements. Moreover, high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR&#8208;TEM) analysis shows crystalline domain sizes ranging from 20 to 100 nm for the newly synthesized V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Spin State of Fe Center by Bridge Bonded Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Ti Ligands for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring functional substrates and precisely regulating the electronic structures of atomic metal active species with moderate spin state are of great importance yet remain challenging. Here, we provide an axial Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Ti ligand regulated spin&#8208;state transition strategy to improve the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of Fe centers. Theoretical calculations firstly indicate that Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Ti ligands in FeN3O&#8208;O&#8208;Ti can induce the low&#8208;to&#8208;medium spin state transition and O2  adsorption optimization of FeN3O. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the oriented catalyst was prepared from atomic&#8208;Fe doped polymer&#8208;like quantum dots and ultrathin o&#8208;terminated MXene. The optimal catalyst exhibits an intrinsic activity that is almost 5 times higher than the contrast sample (without axial Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Ti ligands). Moreover, it also delivers a superior performance in Zn&#8208;air battery and H2  /O2  anion exchange membrane fuel cell in a wide&#8208;temperature range.</dc:description>

         <title>Microsecond Backbone Motions Modulate the Oligomerization of the DNAJB6 Chaperone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNAJB6 is a prime example of an anti&#8208;aggregation chaperone that functions as an oligomer. DNAJB6 oligomers are dynamic and subunit exchange is critical for inhibiting client protein aggregation. The T193A mutation in the C&#8208;terminal domain (CTD) of DNAJB6 reduces both chaperone self&#8208;oligomerization and anti&#8208;aggregation of client proteins, and has recently been linked to Parkinson&#8217;s disease. Here, we show by NMR, including relaxation&#8208;based methods, that the T193A mutation has minimal effects on the structure of the &#946;&#8208;stranded CTD but increases the population and rate of formation of a partially folded state. The results can be rationalized in terms of &#946;&#8208;strand peptide plane flips that occur on a timescale of ~100 &#956;s and lead to global changes in the overall pleat/flatness of the CTD, thereby altering its ability to oligomerize. These findings help forge a link between chaperone dynamics/ oligomerization and anti&#8208;aggregation activity which may possibly lead to new therapeutic avenues tuned to target specific substrates.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In recent years, asymmetric catalysis of ynamides has attracted much attention, but these reactions mostly constructed central chirality, except for few examples on the synthesis of axially chiral compounds which exclusively relied on noble&#8208;metal catalysis. Herein, a facile access to axially chiral N&#8208;heterocycles enabled by chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization of ynamides is disclosed, which represents the first metal&#8208;free protocol for the construction of axially chiral compounds from ynamides. This method allows the practical and atom&#8208;economical synthesis of valuable N&#8208;arylindoles in excellent yields with generally excellent enantioselectivities. Moreover, organocatalysts and ligands based on such axially chiral N&#8208;arylindole skeletons are demonstrated to be applicable to asymmetric catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Identifying Performance Descriptors in CO2 Hydrogenation over Iron&#8208;based Catalysts Promoted with Alkali Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkali metal promoters have been widely employed for preparation of heterogeneous catalysts used in many industrially important reactions. However, the fundamentals of their effects are usually difficult to access. Herein, we unravel mechanistic and kinetic aspects of the role of alkali metals in CO2  hydrogenation over Fe&#8208;based catalysts through the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art characterization techniques, spatially resolved steady&#8208;state and transient kinetic analyses. The promoters affect electronic properties of iron in iron carbides. These carbide characteristics determine catalyst ability to activate H2  , CO and CO2  . The Allen scale electronegativity of alkali metal promoter was successfully correlated with the rates of CO2  hydrogenation to higher hydrocarbons and CH4  as well as with the rate constants of individual steps of CO or CO2  activation . The derived knowledge can be valuable for designing and preparation of catalysts applied in other reactions where such promoters are also used.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterotrimetallic Double Cavity Cages: Syntheses and Selective Guest Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for the synthesis of two heterotrimetallic double cavity cages, [PdnPtmL4]6+, (where n=1 and m =2 or n=2 and m=1) is described. The cages are shown to interact with several different guest molecules. The cage with two identical cavities can bind two identical guest molecules in a non&#8208;cooperative fashion, whereas the cage with two different cavities can bind two different guests in a segregated manner.







Abstract
A strategy for the generation of heterotrimetallic double cavity (DC) cages [PdnPtmL4]6+ (DC1: n=1, m=2; and DC2: n=2, m=1) is reported. The DC cages were generated by combining an inert platinum(II) tetrapyridylaldehyde complex with a suitably substituted pyridylamine and PdII ions. 1H and DOSY nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESIMS) data were consistent with the formation of the DC architectures. DC1 and DC2 were shown to interact with several different guest molecules. The structure of DC1, which features two identical cavities, binding two 2,6&#8208;diaminoanthraquinone (DAQ) guest molecules was determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. In addition, DC1 was shown to bind two molecules of 5&#8208;fluorouracil (5&#8208;FU) in a statistical (non&#8208;cooperative) manner. In contrast, DC2, which features two different cage cavities, was found to interact with two different guests, 5&#8208;FU and cisplatin, selectively.

         <title>Synthesis of Enantiopure Sulfoxides by Concurrent Photocatalytic Oxidation and Biocatalytic Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The power of biocatalysis and photocatalysis was combined in one pot for a concurrent reduction&#8211;oxidation sequence to gain access to enantiopure sulfoxides. In a cyclic deracemization process the enantioselective biocatalytic reduction is followed by a non&#8208;stereoselective light&#8208;dependent oxidation to yield the desired target compounds in &gt;99&#8201;% ee. rac&#8208;sulfoxides carrying various substituents on the aromatic ring were well accepted by the system.







Abstract
The concurrent operation of chemical and biocatalytic reactions in one pot is still a challenging task, and, in particular for chemical photocatalysts, examples besides simple cofactor recycling systems are rare. However, especially due to the complementary chemistry that the two fields of catalysis promote, their combination in one pot has the potential to unlock intriguing, unprecedented overall reactivities. Herein we demonstrate a concurrent biocatalytic reduction and photocatalytic oxidation process. Specifically, the enantioselective biocatalytic sulfoxide reduction using (S)&#8208;selective methionine sulfoxide reductases was coupled to an unselective light&#8208;dependent sulfoxidation. Protochlorophyllide was established as a new green photocatalyst for the sulfoxidation. Overall, a cyclic deracemization process to produce nonracemic sulfoxides was achieved and the target compounds were obtained with excellent conversions (up to 91&#8201;%) and superb optical purity (&gt;99&#8201;% ee).

         <title>Critical Role of Removing Impurities in Nickel Oxide on High&#8208;Efficiency and Long&#8208;Term Stability of Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality NiOx nanoparticles have been synthesized via an ionic liquid&#8208;assisted synthesis method (NiOx&#8208;IL). The inverted perovskite solar cell based on a NiOx&#8208;IL hole transport layer exhibits a striking efficiency exceeding 22.62&#8201;%, and a superior operational stability maintaining 92&#8201;% of its initial efficiency at a maximum power point tracking under one sun illumination for 1000&#8197;h.







Abstract
The performance enhancement of inverted perovskite solar cells applying nickel oxide (NiOx) as the hole transport layer (HTL) has been limited by impurity ions (such as nitrate ions). Herein, we have proposed a strategy to obtain high&#8208;quality NiOx nanoparticles via an ionic liquid&#8208;assisted synthesis method (NiOx&#8208;IL). Experimental and theoretical results illustrate that the cation of the ionic liquid can inhibit the adsorption of impurity ions on nickel hydroxide through a strong hydrogen bond and low adsorption energy, thereby obtaining NiOx&#8208;IL HTL with high conductivity and strong hole&#8208;extraction ability. Importantly, the removal of impurity ions can effectively suppress the redox reaction between the NiOx film and the perovskite film, thus slowing down the deterioration of device performance.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Assisted Aqueous Manganese&#8208;Ion Battery Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton intercalation chemistry was introduced in aqueous manganese&#8208;ion cells, in which the layered Al0.1V2O5&#8901;1.5&#8201;H2O cathode exhibits a consequent Mn2+ and H+ ion intercalation/extraction mechanism. Such an energy release/storage process contributes to high capacity, fast kinetics and stable cycling performance.







Abstract
Aqueous manganese&#8208;ion batteries (MIBs) are promising energy storage systems because of the distinctive merits of Mn metal, in terms of high abundance, low cost, nontoxicity, high theoretical capacity and low redox potential. Conventional MIBs are based on the Mn2+ ion storage mechanism, whereas the capacity in cathode materials is generally limited due to the high charge density and large solvated ionic radius of Mn2+ ions in aqueous electrolytes. Herein, proton intercalation chemistry is introduced in aqueous MIBs, in which the layered Al0.1V2O5&#8901;1.5&#8201;H2O (AlVO) cathode exhibits a consequent Mn2+ and H+ ion intercalation/extraction process. Such an energy storage mechanism contributes to enhanced electrochemical performance, including high capacity, fast reaction kinetics and stable cycling behavior. Benefiting from this proton intercalation chemistry, the aqueous Mn||AlVO cells could deliver high specific energy and power simultaneously. This work provides a route for the design of high&#8208;performance aqueous MIBs.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Dynamic Microbial Fe(III) Respiration Metabolism with a Living Cell&#8208;Compatible Electron&#8208;Sensing Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electron&#8208;sensing probe Zn2GeO4:Mn@Fe3+ was developed to achieve dynamic Fe(III) respiration metabolism monitoring in S. putrefaciens. With excellent monitoring performance, the Zn2GeO4:Mn@Fe3+ probe offers the potential to track the dynamic Fe(III) respiration metabolic response of S. putrefaciens to environmental stress and microbial co&#8208;culture interactions. Additionally, the Zn2GeO4:Mn@Fe3+ probe provides guidance for biosynthesis efficiency optimization.







Abstract
Monitoring microbial metabolism is vital for biomanufacturing processes optimization. However, it remains a grand challenge to offer insight into microbial metabolism due to particularly complex and dynamic processes. Here, we report an electron&#8208;sensing probe Zn2GeO4:Mn@Fe3+ for real&#8208;time and dynamic monitoring of Fe(III) respiration metabolism. The quenched persistent luminescence of Zn2GeO4:Mn@Fe3+ is recovered when Fe3+ accepted electrons from the dynamic Fe(III) respiration metabolism, enabling the real&#8208;time monitoring of microbial metabolism. The probe shows the capability to verify the role of related biomolecules in microbial Fe(III) respiration metabolism, to track the dynamic Fe(III) respiration metabolic response to environmental stress and microbial co&#8208;culture interactions. Furthermore, the Zn2GeO4:Mn@Fe3+ probe provides guidance for improving biosynthesis efficiency by monitoring Fe redox recycling in microbial co&#8208;culture.

         <title>Azulene&#8208;Embedded [n]Helicenes (n=5, 6 and 7)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; approach has been used to synthesize azulene&#8208;embedded pristine [n]helicenes (n=5, 6 and 7) that show low&#8208;lying first electric states, small optical energy gaps, and anti&#8208;Kasha emissions. These azulene&#8208;embedded [n]helicenes contribute to the non&#8208;benzenoid helicene library and allow structure&#8211;property relationships to be better understood.







Abstract
Azulene is a non&#8208;benzenoid aromatic building block with unique chemical structure and physicochemical properties. By using the &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; synthetic strategy, we synthesized three azulene&#8208;embedded [n]helicenes ([n]AzHs, n=5, 6 and 7), in which one terminal azulene subunit was fused with n&#8208;2 benzene rings. P&#8208; and M&#8208;enantiomers were observed in the packing diagrams of [5]&#8208;, and [6]AzHs. However, P&#8208; and M&#8208;[7]AzHs could be isolated by recrystallization of the racemic mixture. These [n]AzHs were endowed with new properties through the azulene moiety such as low&#8208;lying first electric state (S1), small optical energy gap and anti&#8208;Kasha emission. [6]&#8208;, and [7]AzHs exhibit strong chiroptical responses with high absorption dissymmetry factor (gabs) maxima of about 0.02, which is among the highest |gabs| values of helicenes in the visible range. These azulene&#8208;embedded [n]helicenes contribute to the non&#8208;benzenoid helicene library and allow the structure&#8211;property relationships to be better understood.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Directed Caging Enables the Control of Endogenous DNA Alkyltransferase Activity with Light inside Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first control of endogenous human O6&#8208;alkylguanine&#8208;DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) activity with light in live cells via the small&#8208;molecule&#8208;ligand&#8208;directed caging strategy without genetic engineering is reported. The light&#8208;responsive alkylated AGT is dealkylated for the first time to recover the DNA repair activity in breast cancer MCF&#8208;7 cells by the dose&#8208;dependent light irradiation.







Abstract
The control of endogenous protein activity with light inside live cells is helpful for the high spatiotemporal probing of their dynamic roles. Herein, we report the first small&#8208;molecule&#8208;ligand&#8208;directed caging approach to control the endogenous human O6&#8208;alkylguanine&#8208;DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) activity with light, and the caged AGT is constructed from the native intracellular AGT. The photo&#8208;responsive O6&#8208;benzylguanine derivative O6&#8208;NBG3 is developed to site&#8208;specifically cage the AGT&#8242;s catalytic cysteine residue, and the light irradiation on&#8208;demand restores AGT&#8242;s activity in vitro, in bacteria, and in mammalian cells. With O6&#8208;NBG3, the alkylated AGT is dealkylated for the first time to recover the DNA repair activity in breast cancer MCF&#8208;7 cells by the dose&#8208;dependent light irradiation. This decaging strategy enables the localized modulation of endogenous AGT activity with high temporal precision without genetic engineering, which holds great potential for therapeutic applications.

&lt;p&gt;The control of endogenous protein activity with light inside live cells is helpful for the high spatiotemporal probing of their dynamic roles. Herein, we report the first small-molecule-ligand-directed caging approach to control the endogenous human O&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) activity with light, and the caged AGT is constructed from the native intracellular AGT. The photo-responsive O&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-benzylguanine derivative O&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-NBG3 is developed to site-specifically cage the AGT&#8242;s catalytic cysteine residue, and the light irradiation on-demand restores AGT&#8242;s activity in vitro, in bacteria, and in mammalian cells. With O&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-NBG3, the alkylated AGT is dealkylated for the first time to recover the DNA repair activity in breast cancer MCF-7 cells by the dose-dependent light irradiation. This decaging strategy enables the localized modulation of endogenous AGT activity with high temporal precision without genetic engineering, which holds great potential for therapeutic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Extreme Enhancement of Carbon Hydrogasification via Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plants capture CO2 from the air and fix it with H2O into carbohydrate molecules via photosynthesis. The main photosynthesized biomass, wood, can be converted into charcoal and chemicals via pyrolysis. The charcoal can then be hydrogenated into hydrocarbons using a mechanochemical method. The produced CH4 can be used directly as fuel, or as a feedstock for the synthesis of other chemicals, thereby creating a neutral or negative carbon cycle.







Abstract
Carbon hydrogasification is the slowest reaction among all carbon&#8208;involved small&#8208;molecule transformations. Here, we demonstrate a mechanochemical method that results in both a faster reaction rate and a new synthesis route. The reaction rate was dramatically enhanced by up to 4 orders of magnitude compared to the traditional thermal method. Simultaneously, the reaction exhibited very high selectivity (99.8&#8201;% CH4, versus 80&#8201;% under thermal conditions) with a cobalt catalyst. Our study demonstrated that this extreme increase in reaction rate originates from the continuous activation of reactive carbon species via mechanochemistry. The high selectivity is intimately related to the activation at low temperature, at which higher hydrocarbons are difficult to form. This work is expected to advance studies of carbon hydrogasification, and other solid&#8208;gas reactions.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Driven by the development of new functional inks, inkjet&#8208;printed electronics has reached several milestones by moving from the integration of simple electronic elements (e.g., temperature and pressure sensors, RFID antennas, etc.) to high&#8208;tech application fields (  e.g  . optoelectronics, energy storage and harvesting, medical diagnosis). Currently, inkjet printing techniques suffer from spatial resolution higher than several micrometers, a redhibitory threshold for miniaturization and for many applications that require to control organization of constituents at the nanometer scale. In this review, we present the physico&#8208;chemical concepts and the equipment constraints underpinning the resolution limit of inkjet printing method and point out the input of molecular, supramolecular and nanomaterial&#8208;based approaches for their circumvention. Based on these considerations, we propose future trajectories for inkjet&#8208;printing resolution improvement that will be driven and supported by breakthroughs coming from chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanographene with Multiple Embedded Heptagons: Cascade Radical Photocyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;induced radical cyclization was used in the synthesis of nanocarbons with embedded heptagons, providing a new approach towards nanocarbons with novel topologies. The nanographene reported herein bears six heptagons, representing the nanocarbon containing largest number of heptagons by organic synthesis reported to date. The embedded heptagons distort the graphene core into a Monkey&#8208;saddle&#8208;shaped conformation.







Abstract
Although heptagons are widely found in graphenic materials, the precise synthesis of nanocarbons containing heptagons remains a challenge, especially for the nanocarbons containing multiple&#8208;heptagons. Herein, we show that photo&#8208;induced radical cyclization (PIRC) can be used to synthesize multi&#8208;heptagon&#8208;embedded nanocarbons. Notably, a nanographene containing six heptagons (1) was obtained via a six&#8208;fold cascade PIRC reaction. The structure of 1 was clearly validated and showed a Monkey&#8208;saddle&#8208;shaped conformation. Experimental bond analysis and theoretical calculations indicated that the heptagons in 1 were non&#8208;aromatic, whereas the peripheral rings were highly aromatic. Compared to planar nanographene with the same number of &#960; electrons, 1 had a similar optical gap due to a compromise between the decreased conjugation in the wrapped structure and enhanced electronic delocalization at the rim. Electrochemical studies showed that 1 had low&#8208;lying oxidation potentials, which was attributed to the nitrogen&#8208;doping.

         <title>Rapid Access to Multisubstituted Acrylamides from Cyclic Ketones via Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium/norbornene&#8208;catalyzed vicinal difunctionalization of enol triflates has been developed for rapid, modular and regioselective synthesis of multisubstituted acrylamides from simple ketones. The reaction exhibits broad functional group tolerance, and the use of bulky secondary amide&#8208;derived norbornenes appears to be a key parameter to maintain high efficiency and selectivity.







Abstract
A strategy to access diverse multisubstituted acrylamides from cyclic ketones is realized via palladium/norbornene&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;carbamoylation and ipso&#8208;functionalization of the corresponding enol triflates. The development of bulky C2 secondary amide&#8208;substituted norbornene cocatalysts is the key to achieve the desired reactivity and selectivity. Readily available carbamoyl chlorides serve as effective electrophiles; various moieties including alkenyl, hydrogen, alkynyl, aryl, and alkyl groups can be installed at the ipso position. In addition, tandem &#945;&#8208;carbamoylation/ipso&#8208;annulations are demonstrated to furnish lactam&#8208;containing polycyclic scaffolds. The utility of this method is exemplified in the streamlined preparation of a platelet&#8208;activating factor (PAF)&#8208;antagonist.

         <title>Boosting Cycling Stability and Rate Capability of Li&#8211;CO2 Batteries via Synergistic Photoelectric Effect and Plasmonic Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;field assisted strategy is presented to boost cycling stability (86.9&#8201;% round&#8208;trip efficiency after 100 cycles at 0.10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and rate capability at 2.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (1.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) of a Li&#8211;CO2 battery based on the synergetic photoelectric effect of TiO2 and plasmonic interaction of silver nanoparticles.







Abstract
Sluggish CO2 reduction/evolution kinetics at cathodes seriously impede the realistic applications of Li&#8211;CO2 batteries. Herein, synergistic photoelectric effect and plasmonic interaction are introduced to accelerate CO2 reduction/evolution reactions by designing a silver nanoparticle&#8208;decorated titanium dioxide nanotube array cathode. The incident light excites energetic photoelectrons/holes in titanium dioxide to overcome reaction barriers, and induces the intensified electric field around silver nanoparticles to enable effective separation/transfer of photogenerated carriers and a thermodynamically favorable reaction pathway. The resulting Li&#8211;CO2 battery demonstrates ultra&#8208;low charge voltage of 2.86&#8197;V at 0.10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, good cycling stability with 86.9&#8201;% round&#8208;trip efficiency after 100 cycles, and high rate capability at 2.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work offers guidance on rational cathode design for advanced Li&#8211;CO2 batteries and beyond.

The resulting Li&#8211;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery demonstrates ultra-low charge voltage of 2.86&#8197;V at 0.10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, good cycling stability with 86.9&#8201;% round-trip efficiency after 100 cycles, and high rate capability at 2.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This work offers guidance on rational cathode design for advanced Li&#8211;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Tough Elastomers from Stereochemistry&#8208;Directed Hydrogen Bonding in Isosorbide&#8208;Based Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stereochemical configuration of the rigid&#8208;ring structures of isosorbide (ISPU) and isomannide (IMPU) direct strong hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions which impart unique properties including strain&#8208;rate&#8208;dependent behavior, significant strain hardening, and high optical clarity that are not possible using other chemical approaches to elastomer design.







Abstract
The remarkable elasticity and tensile strength found in natural elastomers are challenging to mimic. Synthetic elastomers typically feature covalently cross&#8208;linked networks (rubbers), but this hinders their reprocessability. Physical cross&#8208;linking via hydrogen bonding or ordered crystallite domains can afford reprocessable elastomers, but often at the cost of performance. Herein, we report the synthesis of ultra&#8208;tough, reprocessable elastomers based on linear alternating polymers. The incorporation of a rigid isohexide adjacent to urethane moieties affords elastomers with exceptional strain hardening, strain rate dependent behavior, and high optical clarity. Distinct differences were observed between isomannide and isosorbide&#8208;based elastomers where the latter displays superior tensile strength and strain recovery. These phenomena are attributed to the regiochemical irregularities in the polymers arising from their distinct stereochemistry and respective inter&#8208;chain hydrogen bonding.

         <title>The Protein&#8208;Templated Synthesis of Enzyme&#8208;Generated Aptamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by molecular imprinting and using a unique enzyme, for the first time, the protein&#8208;templated synthesis of enzyme&#8208;generated aptamers (EGAs) against a protein target is demonstrated which shows enhanced binding compared to a control. This suggests that EGAs can be formed through dynamic interactions between the EGAs and the target protein as well as competition for binding EGAs between the enzyme and the target.







Abstract
Inspired by the chemical synthesis of molecularly imprinted polymers, we demonstrated for the first time, the protein&#8208;target mediated synthesis of enzyme&#8208;generated aptamers (EGAs). We prepared pre&#8208;polymerisation mixtures containing different ratios of nucleotides, an initiator sequence and protein template and incubated each mixture with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). Upon purification and rebinding of the EGAs against the target, we observed an enhancement in binding of templated&#8208;EGAs towards the target compared to a non&#8208;templated control. These results demonstrate the presence of two primary mechanisms for the formation of EGAs, namely, the binding of random sequences to the target as observed in systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) and the dynamic competition between TdT enzyme and the target protein for binding of EGAs during synthesis. The latter mechanism serves to increase the stringency of EGA&#8208;based screening and represents a new way to develop aptamers that relies on rational design.

         <title>Atom Swapping on Aromatic Rings: Conversion from Phosphinine Pincer Metal Complexes to Metallabenzenes Triggered by O2 Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel synthetic method for metallabenzene was developed in which a phosphorus atom in a phosphinine ring is swapped with transition metal fragments. The oxidation of a phosphinine pincer iridium complex by O2 afforded iridabenzene via exchange of the phosphorus atom and the iridium fragment. Dianionic rhodabenzene was synthesized by O2 oxidation of an analogous rhodium complex, followed by reduction by metallic potassium.







Abstract
Herein, we report a novel method for the synthesis of metallabenzenes by swapping the phosphorus atom in an aromatic phosphinine ring with transition metal fragments. The oxidation of a phosphine&#8208;phosphinine&#8208;phosphine pincer iridium complex by O2 triggered the replacement of the phosphorus atom of the phosphinine ring by an iridium fragment to afford iridabenzene. Dianionic rhodabenzene was also synthesized from a phosphinine rhodium complex by oxidation of the phosphorus atom, followed by subsequent reduction using metallic potassium. The aromaticity of the newly synthesized irida&#8208; and rhoda&#8208;benzenes was evaluated both experimentally and theoretically.

         <title>Active Mechanical Threading by a Molecular Motor**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular machine is presented that uses the light&#8208;powered unidirectional rotation trajectory of a molecular motor to actively thread a tetraethylene glycol chain through a macrocyclic ring. This molecular setup thus realizes the miniaturization of macroscopic threading providing a fundamental entry step into mechanical molecular weaving or sewing processes.







Abstract
Molecular motors transform external energy input into directional motions and offer exquisite precision for nano&#8208;scale manipulations. To make full use of molecular motor capacities, their directional motions need to be transmitted and used for powering downstream molecular events. Here we present a macrocyclic molecular motor structure able to perform repetitive molecular threading of a flexible tetraethylene glycol chain through the macrocycle. This mechanical threading event is actively powered by the motor and leads to a direct translation of the unidirectional motor rotation into unidirectional translation motion (chain versus ring). The mechanism of the active mechanical threading is elucidated and the actual threading step is identified as a combined helix inversion and threading event. The established molecular machine function resembles the crucial step of macroscopic weaving or sewing processes and therefore offers a first entry point to a &#8220;molecular knitting&#8221; counterpart.

         <title>Increasing the Number of Aluminum Atoms in T3 Sites of a Mordenite Zeolite by Low&#8208;Pressure SiCl4 Treatment to Catalyze Dimethyl Ether Carbonylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
After low&#8208;pressure SiCl4 treatment (LPST), the undesired framework aluminum atoms in the 12&#8208;MR channels of a mordenite (MOR) zeolite migrate to the desired T3 sites to increase the number of favorable active sites.







Abstract
Controlling the location of aluminum atoms in a zeolite framework is critical for understanding structure&#8211;performance relationships of catalytic reaction systems and tailoring catalyst design. Herein, we report a strategy to preferentially relocate mordenite (MOR) framework Al atoms into the desired T3 sites by low&#8208;pressure SiCl4 treatment (LPST). High&#8208;field 27Al NMR was used to identify the exact location of framework Al for the MOR samples. The results indicate that 73&#8201;% of the framework Al atoms were at the T3 sites after LPST under optimal conditions, which leads to controllably generating and intensifying active sites in MOR zeolite for the dimethyl ether (DME) carbonylation reaction with higher methyl acetate (MA) selectivity and much longer lifetime (25&#8197;times). Further research reveals that the Al relocation mechanism involves simultaneous extraction, migration, and reinsertion of Al atoms from and into the parent MOR framework. This unique method is potentially applicable to other zeolites to control Al location.

         <title>A Morphing [4Fe&#8208;3S&#8208;nO]&#8208;Cluster within a Carbon Monoxide Dehydrogenase Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exchange of one amino acid (Cys&#8208;&gt;Glu) coordinating the Ni/Fe/S&#8208;cluster in carbon monoxide dehydrogenases (CODH) is the main difference resulting in the formation of a Fe/S/O&#8208;hybrid&#8208;cluster, found in CooS&#8208;V, while conserving the overall architecture of CODHs. The Fe/S/O&#8208;hybrid&#8208;cluster in CooS&#8208;V reversibly rearranges dependent on its redox&#8208;state.







Abstract
Ni,Fe&#8208;containing carbon monoxide dehydrogenases (CODHs) catalyze the reversible reduction of CO2 to CO. Several anaerobic microorganisms encode multiple CODHs in their genome, of which some, despite being annotated as CODHs, lack a cysteine of the canonical binding motif for the active site Ni,Fe&#8208;cluster. Here, we report on the structure and reactivity of such a deviant enzyme, termed CooS&#8208;VCh. Its structure reveals the typical CODH scaffold, but contains an iron&#8208;sulfur&#8208;oxo hybrid&#8208;cluster. Although closely related to true CODHs, CooS&#8208;VCh catalyzes neither CO oxidation, nor CO2 reduction. The active site of CooS&#8208;VCh undergoes a redox&#8208;dependent restructuring between a reduced [4Fe&#8208;3S]&#8208;cluster and an oxidized [4Fe&#8208;2S&#8208;S*&#8208;2O&#8208;2(H2O)]&#8208;cluster. Hydroxylamine, a slow&#8208;turnover substrate of CooS&#8208;VCh, oxidizes the hybrid&#8208;cluster in two structurally distinct steps. Overall, minor changes in CODHs are sufficient to accommodate a Fe/S/O&#8208;cluster in place of the Ni,Fe&#8208;heterocubane&#8208;cluster of CODHs.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Fluorescent Block Copolymer Micelles with Responsive Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The encapsulation of Schiff base&#8208;like zinc(II) complexes into micelles derived from polystyrene&#8208;block&#8208;poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) diblock copolymers that offer coordination sites was investigated. Incorporation and ligation results in strongly emissive micelles with enhanced quantum yields and thermal stability compared to the neat complex in pyridine. The responsivity towards medium and acidity was utilized to design a turn&#8208;on emission sensor material upon micelle formation.







Abstract
Responsive fluorescent materials offer a high potential for sensing and (bio&#8208;)imaging applications. To investigate new concepts for such materials and to broaden their applicability, the previously reported non&#8208;fluorescent zinc(II) complex [Zn(L)] that shows coordination&#8208;induced turn&#8208;on emission was encapsulated into a family of non&#8208;fluorescent polystyrene&#8208;block&#8208;poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) (PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP) diblock copolymer micelles leading to brightly emissive materials. Coordination&#8208;induced turn&#8208;on emission upon incorporation and ligation of the [Zn(L)] in the P4VP core outperform parent [Zn(L)] in pyridine solution with respect to lifetimes, quantum yields, and temperature resistance. The quantum yield can be easily tuned by tailoring the selectivity of the employed solvent or solvent mixture and, thus, the tendency of the PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP diblock copolymers to self&#8208;assemble into micelles. A medium&#8208;dependent off&#8211;on sensor upon micelle formation could be established by suppression of non&#8208;micelle&#8208;borne emission background pertinent to chloroform through controlled acidification indicating an additional pH&#8208;dependent process.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent and Enantioselective Hydroalkynylation of Unactivated 1,1&#8208;Disubstituted Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroalkynylation of unactivated 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes is reported. Taking advantage of amide coordination and ligand control, both Markovnikov and anti&#8208;Markovnikov alkynylation were readily accessible with high enantioselectivities. Computational studies revealed the origin of the ligand&#8208;controlled change of regioselectivity.







Abstract
Catalytic enantioselective functionalization of unactivated 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes is challenging due to the difficulty to discriminate the enantiotopic faces. Enantioselective hydrofunctionalization of unactivated 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes with tunable Markovnikov and anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity remains elusive. We report here an amide&#8208;directed, regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroalkynylation of unactivated alkenes. The regioselectivity can be readily tuned by the choice of a proper ligand. Catalytic alkynylations occurred with tunable Markovnikov and anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity to afford products containing acyclic tertiary or quaternary stereocenters &#946; to an amide. Combining a sequence of alkene isomerization and regioselective hydroalkynylation, we further realized an iridium&#8208;catalyzed formal asymmetric conjugated alkynylation of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides. Computational studies suggest that the regioselectivity is dictated by the ligand structures.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report stepwise solution&#8208;synthesis of linear nonalternant nanoribbons (  NNRs  ), featuring pentagonal rings  peri  &#8208;fused onto the repeating perylene unit. The X&#8208;ray single crystal structures demonstrated their &#960;&#8208;backbones as a twisted ribbon, with the longest crystalline length of the nanoribbon up to 3.9 nm.  NNRs  exhibited an orange to deep&#8208;red photoluminescence even under the room light, with absolute  &#934;  F  up to 82%, most likely due to ring&#8208;strain induced molecular stiffness. Benefiting from the enlarged size and the antiaromatic character of pentagons, all of  NNRs  possessed ambipolar redox properties, especially for longer nanoribbons showing multiple reversible reductions and oxidations. In addition, experimental and theoretical results indicated a ground state open&#8208;shell singlet diradicaloid for the dication of longer  NNRs  . Our studies reveal the intriguing nonalternant structures and physical properties of this type of nanoribbons, involving the striking effects of the multiple annulated pentagons, and also provide fundamental insights into their electronic structures</dc:description>

         <title>Transforming Dyes Into Fluorophores: Exciton&#8208;Induced Emission with Chain&#8208;like Oligo&#8208;BODIPY Superstructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we present a systematic study demonstrating to which extent exciton formation can amplify fluorescence based on a series of ethylene&#8208;bridged oligo&#8208;BODIPYs. A set of non&#8208; and weakly fluorescent BODIPY motifs was selected and transformed into discrete, chain&#8208;like oligomers by linkage via a flexible ethylene tether. The prepared superstructures constitute excitonically active entities with non&#8208;conjugated, Coulomb&#8208;coupled oscillators. The non&#8208;radiative deactivation channels of Internal Conversion (IC), also combined with an upstream reductive Photoelectron Transfer (rPET) and Intersystem Crossing (ISC) were addressed at the monomeric state and the evolution of fluorescence and (non&#8208;)radiative decay rates studied along the oligomeric series. We demonstrate that a &#8220;masked&#8221; fluorescence can be fully reactivated irrespective of the imposed conformational rigidity. This work challenges the paradigm that a collective fluorescence enhancement is limited to sterically induced motional restrictions.</dc:description>

         <title>Demonstrating and Unraveling a Controlled Nanometer&#8208;Scale Expansion of the Vacancy Defects in Graphene by CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A controlled manipulation of graphene edges and vacancies is desired for molecular separation, sensing and electronics applications. Unfortunately, available etching methods always lead to vacancy nucleation making it challenging to control etching. Herein, we report CO2  &#8208;led controlled etching down to 2&#8211;3 &#197; per minute while completely avoiding vacancy nucleation. This makes CO2  a unique etchant for decoupling pore nucleation and expansion. We show that CO2  expands the steric&#8208;hindrance&#8208;free edges with an activation energy of 2.71 eV, corresponding to the energy barrier for the dissociative chemisorption of CO2  . We demonstrate the presence of an additional configurational energy barrier for nanometer&#8208;sized vacancies resulting in a significantly slower rate of expansion. Finally, CO2  etching is applied to map the location of the intrinsic vacancies in the polycrystalline graphene film where we show that the intrinsic vacancy defects manifest mainly as grain boundary defects where intragrain defects from oxidative etching constitute a minor population.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Stable and Reactive Platinum Single Atoms on Oxygen Plasma&#8208;Functionalized CeO2 Surfaces: Nanostructuring and Peroxo Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically dispersed precious metals on oxide supports have recently become increasingly interesting catalytic materials. Nonetheless, their non&#8208;trivial preparation and limited thermal and environmental stability constitutes an issue for their potential applications. Here we demonstrate that an oxygen plasma pre&#8208;treatment of the ceria (CeO  2  ) surface serves to anchor Pt single atoms, making them active and resistant towards sintering in the CO oxidation reaction. Through a combination of experimental results obtained on well&#8208;defined CeO  2  films and theory, we show that the O  2  plasma causes surface nanostructuring and the formation of surface peroxo (O  2  2&#8208;  ) species, favoring the uniform and dense distribution of isolated strongly bonded Pt  2+  atoms. The promotional effect of the plasma treatment was further demonstrated on the powder Pt/CeO  2  catalysts. We believe that plasma functionalization can be applied to other metal/oxide systems to achieve tunable and stable catalysts with a high density of active sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen Bonding: A New Platform for Achieving Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Persistent Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halogen bonding is an effective tool in solid&#8208;state supramolecular chemistry to stabilize crystal structures. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202200236), Zhengxu Cai and co&#8208;workers introduced intermolecular halogen bonding (CN&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br) into a host&#8212;guest room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) system, achieving fluorescence&#8212;phosphorescence dual emission. The weak intermolecular interactions of the halogen bond are sensitive to external stimuli (heat, mechanical force and X&#8208;rays), realizing colorimetric multi&#8208;stimuli response behavior.

Self&#8208;propulsion multifunctional microrobots harboring chiral supramolecular selectors represent a promising pathway for &#8220;enantiorecognition&#8208;on&#8208;the&#8208;fly&#8221; while employing different readouts (e.g., optical and electrical). The combination of different active compounds in a single architecture allows for a multifunctional microrobot that simultaneously exhibits chiral recognition, but also fluorescent properties and the ability to be magnetically navigable and propelled in the presence of a chemical fuel, as described by Martin Pumera and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202116090).

         <title>Tandem Macrolactone Synthesis: Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Exiguolide by a Macrocyclization/Transannular Pyran Cyclization Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrahydropyran&#8208;containing macrolactones were synthesized by integrating Meyer&#8211;Schuster rearrangement, macrocyclic ring&#8208;closing metathesis, and transannular oxa&#8208;Michael addition under gold and ruthenium catalysis. Single&#8208;step access to a variety of 14&#8208; to 20&#8208;membered macrolactones containing a tetrahydropyran ring was possible from readily available linear precursors in good yields and with moderate to excellent diastereoselectivity. A 13&#8208;step synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;exiguolide, an anticancer marine macrolide, showcased the feasibility of our domino reaction sequence for macrolactone synthesis and also demonstrated the power of transannular reactions for rapid assembly of the tetrahydropyran rings of the target natural product.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination&#8208;Controlled Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Benzylic Allylation of Unactivated Electron&#8208;Deficient Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterocycles are widespread in pharmaceuticals but methods for their transition metal&#8208;catalyzed functionalization remain limited. This report describes a general, mild, and effective nickel&#8208;catalyzed benzylic allylation and benzylation of 14 types of heterocyclic aromatic compounds, including pyridines, pyrazines, pyrimidines, pyridazines, triazines, benzimidazoles, oxazoles, thiazoles, as well as 3,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;indoles. The exquisite selectivity for benzylic sites at the 2&#8208;position is hypothesized to be controlled by coordination of a heterocyclic nitrogen to Zn(TMP)  2  subverting generally presumed pKa&#8217;s of benzylic protons. Furthermore, the broad range of heterocyclic substrates, the diversity of electrophiles, and excellent functional group compatibility suggest its future application to synthesis of complex molecules and library diversification in drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Reliable Low&#8208;Dimensional Perovskites Passivated Black&#8208;phase CsPbI3 toward Stable and Efficient Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low&#8208;dimensional (LD) perovskites can effectively passivate and stabilize 3D perovskites for high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). To CsPbI  3  &#8208;based PSCs, the influence of high temperature annealing on LD perovskite passivation effect has to be taken into account due to the black&#8208;phase CsPbI  3  crystallization requires high temperature treatment, however, which has been rarely concerned so far. Here, the thermal stability of LD perovskites based on three hydrophobic organic ammonium salts and their passivation effect toward CsPbI  3  and the whole device performance, have been investigated. It is found that, phenyltrimethylammonium iodide (PTAI) and its corresponding LD perovskites exhibit excellent thermal stability. Further investigation reveals that PTAI&#8208;based LD perovskites are mainly distributed at grain boundaries, which not only enhance the phase stability of CsPbI  3  but also effectively suppress non&#8208;radiative recombination. As a consequence, the champion PSC device based on CsPbI  3  exhibit a record efficiency of 21.0% with high stability.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Low-dimensional (LD) perovskites can effectively passivate and stabilize 3D perovskites for high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). To CsPbI  3  -based PSCs, the influence of high temperature annealing on LD perovskite passivation effect has to be taken into account due to the black-phase CsPbI  3  crystallization requires high temperature treatment, however, which has been rarely concerned so far. Here, the thermal stability of LD perovskites based on three hydrophobic organic ammonium salts and their passivation effect toward CsPbI  3  and the whole device performance, have been investigated. It is found that, phenyltrimethylammonium iodide (PTAI) and its corresponding LD perovskites exhibit excellent thermal stability. Further investigation reveals that PTAI-based LD perovskites are mainly distributed at grain boundaries, which not only enhance the phase stability of CsPbI  3  but also effectively suppress non-radiative recombination. As a consequence, the champion PSC device based on CsPbI  3  exhibit a record efficiency of 21.0% with high stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic allylations of pyridinium and quinolinium ions with various allyl pinacolboronates are reported. The reactions are completely selective with respect to the site of the azinium ion that is attacked, to give various functionalized 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines and 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinolines. Evidence suggests that the reactions proceed through nucleophilic allylgold(I) intermediates formed by transmetalation from allylboronates. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided mechanistic insight.</dc:description>

         <title>A Nanopore Sensing Assay Resolves Cascade Reactions in a Multienzyme System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymatic cascade reactions are widely used to synthesize complex molecules from simple precursors. The major underlying mechanism of cascade reactions is substrate channeling, where intermediates of different enzymatic steps are not in equilibrium with the bulk solution. Here, we report a nanopore sensing assay that allows accurate quantification of all the reaction intermediates and the product of an artificial three&#8208;enzyme system. A DNA&#8208;peptide complex is used as the initial substrate which undergoes sequential enzymatic cleavages in solution. All the temporal changes of the intermediates and product can be obtained through nanopore translocation recordings. Furthermore, we find that in a confined environment such as liposome, substrate channeling occurs between two sets of the three enzymes. Our results demonstrate a novel and powerful approach to determine and quantify substrate channeling effects, which is potentially useful for designing and evaluating multienzyme systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Monoazadichalcogenasumanenes: Synthesis, Structures, and Ring Reconstruction via Atom Transfer under Acidic Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Buckybowls possess unique properties that can be tailored by embedding main group elements into their &#960;&#8208;scaffolds. Herein, a synthetic approach is developed for producing monoazadichalcogenasumanenes (4a/4b, 6a/6b, 7a/7b) derived from sumanene by replacing its three benzylic carbons with one nitrogen and two chalcogen atoms (S for 4a/4b, Se for 6a/6b, Te for 7a/7b). Monoazadichalcogenasumanenes are deeper &#960;&#8208;bowls than trichalcogensumanenes as C&#8211;N bond is much shorter than C&#8211;X (X = S, Se, Te). Particularly, bowl&#8208;depth of 4b (0.95 &#197;) is greater than that of corannulene (0.85 &#197;). The nitrogen atom donates electron density to the entire &#960;&#8208;system that makes monoazadichalcogenasumanenes electron&#8208;rich. Monoazadichalcogenasumanenes undergo ring reconstruction of chalcogenophene ring via transferring a chalcogen atom from one molecule to another under acidic conditions. It is found that both nitrogen and chalcogen atoms play crucial role on this reaction, including conversion rate and relative ratio of ring reconstruction products.</dc:description>

         <title>A Liquid Interfacial SERS Platform on a Nanoparticle Array Stabilized by Rigid Probes for the Quantification of Norepinephrine in Rat Brain Microdialysates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Towards the challenge for reliable determination of trace chemicals in the brain, we created a SERS platform on functionalized AuNPs array formed at liquid/liquid interface in a uniform fashion over a large substrate area through ternary regulations for real&#8208;time quantification of trace norepinephrine (NE). The rigid molecule, 4&#8208;((4&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;3&#8208;ylethynyl)&#8208;phenyl)ethynyl)&#8208;benzaldehyde (RP1) was designed and co&#8208;assembled at AuNPs with 4&#8208;mercaptophenylboronic acid (MPBA) to chemically define NE via dual recognition. Meanwhile, the rigid structure assembly of RP1 and MPBA efficiently fixed interparticle gap, guaranteeing reproducible SERS analysis. Furthermore, Raman peak of C&#8801;C group in silent region was taken as response element to further improve the determination accuracy. Combining with microdialysis technique, this SERS platform was developed for in&#8208;the&#8208;field testing of NE in rat brain microdialysates followed by anxiety model.</dc:description>

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of 3H&#8208;Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The asymmetric hydrogenation (AH) of 3H&#8208;indoles represents an ideal approach to the synthesis of useful chiral indoline scaffolds. However, very few catalytic systems based on precious metals have been developed to realize this challenging reaction. Herein, we report a Mn&#8208;catalyzed AH of 3H&#8208;indoles with excellent yields and enantioselectivities. The kinetic resolution of racemic 3H&#8208;indoles by AH was also achieved with high s&#8208;factors to construct quaternary stereocenters. Many acid&#8208;sensitive functional groups, which cannot be tolerated when using a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ruthenium catalyst, were compatible with manganese catalysis. This new process expands the scope of this transformation and highlights the uniqueness of earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysis. The reaction could proceed with catalyst loadings at the parts per million (ppm) level with an exceptional turnover number of 72,350. This is the highest value yet reported for an earth&#8208;abundant metal&#8208;catalyzed AH reaction.</dc:description>
