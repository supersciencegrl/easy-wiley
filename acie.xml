         <title>Spin Symmetry Breaking&#8208;induced Hubbard Gap Near&#8208;Closure in N&#8208;coordinated MnO2 for Enhanced Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Battery Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal oxides (TMOs) are promising cathode materials for aqueous zinc ion batteries (ZIBs), however, their performance is hindered by a substantial Hubbard gap, which limits electron transfer and battery cyclability. Addressing this, we introduce a heteroatom coordination approach, using triethanolamine to induce axial N coordination on Mn centers in MnO2, yielding N&#8208;coordinated MnO2 (TEAMO). This approach leverages the change of electronegativity disparity between Mn and ligands (O and N) to disrupt spin symmetry and augment spin polarization. This enhancement leads to the closure of the Hubbard gap, primarily driven by the intensified occupancy of the Mn eg orbitals. The resultant TEAMO exhibit a significant increase in storage capacity, reaching 351 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8208;1. Our findings suggest a viable strategy for optimizing the electronic structure of TMO cathodes, enhancing the potential of ZIBs in energy storage technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Poly(Dibenzothiophene&#8208;Terphenyl Piperidinium) for High&#8208;performance Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The anion exchange membrane water electrolysis is widely regarded as the next&#8208;generation technology for producing green hydrogen. The OH&#8208; conductivity of the anion exchange membrane plays a key role in the practical implementation of this device. Here, we present a series of Z&#8208;S&#8208;x membranes with dibenzothiophene groups. These membranes contain sulfur&#8208;enhanced hydrogen bond networks that link surrounding surface site hopping regions, forming continuous OH&#8208; conducting highways. Z&#8208;S&#8208;20 has a high through&#8208;plane OH&#8208; conductivity of 182 &#177; 28 mS cm&#8208;1 and ultralong stability of 2650 h in KOH solution at 80 &#176;C. Based on rational design, we achieved a high PGM&#8208;free alkaline water electrolysis performance of 7.12 A cm&#8208;2 at 2.0 V in a flow cell and demonstrated durability of 650 h at 2 A cm&#8208;2 at 40 &#176;C with a cell voltage increase of 0.65 mV/h.</dc:description>

         <title>Stochastic Sensing of Chloride Anions Using an &#945;&#8208;Hemolysin Pore with semiaza&#8208;Bambusuril Adapter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pores containing molecular adapters provide internal selective binding sites, thereby allowing the stochastic sensing of analytes. Herein, we demonstrate that semiaza&#8208;bambusuril (BU) acts as a non&#8208;covalent molecular adapter when lodged within the lumen of the wild&#8208;type &#945;&#8208;hemolysin (WT&#8208;&#945;HL) protein pore. Because the bambusurils are recognized as anion receptors, the anion binding site within the adapter&#8208;nanopore complex allows the detection of chloride anions, thus converting a non&#8208;selective pore into an anion sensor.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced UV Nonlinear Optical Properties in Layered Germanous Phosphites through Functional Group Sequential Construction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study pioneers a novel strategy for synthesizing   solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals through functional groups sequential construction, effectively addressing the inherent trade&#8208;offs among broad transmittance, enhanced second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG), and optimal birefringence. We have developed two innovative van der Waals layered germanous phosphites: GeHPO3, the first Ge(II)&#8208;based oxide NLO crystal which exhibits a black phosphorus&#8208;like structure, and K(GeHPO3)2Br, distinguished by its exceptional birefringence and graphene&#8208;like structure. Significantly, GeHPO3 exhibits a remarkable array of NLO properties, including the highest SHG coefficient recorded among all NLO crystals for phase&#8208;matching and generating 266 nm coherent light via quadruple frequency conversion. It delivers a potent SHG intensity, surpassing KH2PO4 (KDP) by 10.3 times at 1064 nm and &#946;&#8208;BaB2O4 by 1.3 times at 532 nm, complemented by a distinct UV absorption edge at 211 nm and moderate birefringence of 0.062 at 546 nm. Comprehensive theoretical analysis links these exceptional characteristics to the unique NLO&#8208;active GeO34&#8208; units and the distinctive, highly ordered layered structures. Our findings deliver essential experimental insights into the development of Ge(II)&#8208;based optoelectronic materials and present a strategic blueprint for engineering structure&#8208;driven functional materials with customized properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Activated Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II Fluorescence and SERS Dynamic&#8208;Reversible Probes for Long&#8208;Term Assessment of Osteoarthritis In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The abnormal fluctuation of temperature in vivo usually reflects the progression of inflammatory diseases. Noninvasive, real&#8208;time, and accurate monitoring and imaging of temperature variation in vivo is advantageous for guiding the early diagnosis and treatment of disease, but it remains difficult to achieve. Herein, we developed a temperature&#8208;activated near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II fluorescence (NIR&#8208;II FL) and surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanoprobe for long&#8208;term monitoring of temperature changes in rat arthritis and timely assessment of the status of osteoarthritis. The thermosensitive polymer bearing NIR&#8208;II FL dye was grafted onto the surface of nanoporous core&#8208;satellite gold nanostructures to form the nanoprobe, wherein the nanoprobe contains NIR&#8208;II FL and Raman reference signals that are independent of temperature change. The ratiometric FL1150/FL1550 and S1528/S2226 values of the nanoprobe exhibited a reversible conversion with temperature changes. The nanoprobe accurately distinguishes the temperature variations in the inflamed joint versus the normal joint in vivo by ratiometric FL and SERS imaging, allowing for an accurate diagnosis of inflammation. Meanwhile, it can continuously monitor fluctuations in temperature over an extended period during the onset and treatment of inflammation. The tested temperature change trend could be used as an indicator for early diagnosis of inflammation and real&#8208;time evaluation of therapeutic effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Electrochemical Cross&#8208;Electrophile C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp3) Coupling via a NiII Aryl Amido Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cross&#8208;electrophile coupling (XEC) between aryl halides and alkyl halides is a streamlined approach for C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond construction, which is highly valuable in medicinal chemistry. Based on a key NiII aryl amido intermediate, we developed a highly selective and scalable Ni&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical XEC reaction between (hetero)aryl halides and primary and secondary alkyl halides. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies indicate that an amine secondary ligand slows down the oxidative addition process of the Ni&#8208;polypyridine catalyst to the aryl bromide and a NiII aryl amido intermediate is formed in&#8208;situ during the reaction process. The relatively slow oxidative addition is beneficial for enhancing the selectivity of the XEC reaction. The NiII aryl amido intermediate stabilizes the NiII&#8722;aryl species to prevent the aryl&#8722;aryl homo&#8208;coupling side reactions and acts as a catalyst to activate the alkyl bromide substrates. This electrosynthesis system provides a facile, practical, and scalable platform for the formation of (hetero)aryl&#8722;alkyl bonds using standard Ni catalysts under mild conditions. The mechanistic insights from this work could serve as a great foundation for future studies on Ni&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Photo&#8208;Semipinacol Rearrangement of Unactivated Allylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a photochemical method for the semipinacol rearrangement of unactivated allylic alcohols. Aliphatic as well as aromatic groups participate as migrating groups, yielding a variety of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted ketones. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions and is compatible with ethers, esters, halides, nitriles, carbamates, and substituted arenes. The operationally simple and fully catalytic conditions prescribe 1 mol% benzothiazinoquinoxaline as organophotocatalyst, 0.5 mol% Co&#8208;salen, and 10 mol% lutidinium triflate and, importantly, display reactivity complementary to procedures employing Br&#248;nsted acid. We showcase the utility of the protocol in late&#8208;stage drug diversifications.</dc:description>

         <title>Picturing the Gap Between the Performance and US&#8208;DOE's Hydrogen Storage Target: A Data&#8208;Driven Model for MgH2 Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a data&#8208;driven strategy, we developed models to illustrate the structure&#8208;performance relationships of MgH2&#8208;based materials in solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage. This model also shows the current gap between their performance and the US&#8208;DOE goal.







Abstract
Developing solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage materials is as pressing as ever, which requires a comprehensive understanding of the dehydrogenation chemistry of a solid&#8208;state hydride. Transition state search and kinetics calculations are essential to understanding and designing high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage materials by filling in the knowledge gap that current experimental techniques cannot measure. However, the ab initio analysis of these processes is computationally expensive and time&#8208;consuming. Searching for descriptors to accurately predict the energy barrier is urgently needed, to accelerate the prediction of hydrogen storage material properties and identify the opportunities and challenges in this field. Herein, we develop a data&#8208;driven model to describe and predict the dehydrogenation barriers of a typical solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage material, magnesium hydride (MgH2), based on the combination of the crystal Hamilton population orbital of Mg&#8722;H bond and the distance between atomic hydrogen. By deriving the distance energy ratio, this model elucidates the key chemistry of the reaction kinetics. All the parameters in this model can be directly calculated with significantly less computational cost than conventional transition state search, so that the dehydrogenation performance of hydrogen storage materials can be predicted efficiently. Finally, we found that this model leads to excellent agreement with typical experimental measurements reported to date and provides clear design guidelines on how to propel the performance of MgH2 closer to the target set by the United States Department of Energy (US&#8208;DOE).

         <title>A Versatile Microfluidic Platform for Extravasation Studies Based on DNA Origami&#8212;Cell Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microfluidic device to study cancer cell extravasation that mimics the endothelial barrier using a porous membrane decorated with DNA origami nanostructures displaying adhesion peptides to circulating cancer cells. The device allows visualization of cell transmigration under physiological flow conditions, revealing influences of adhesion peptide type, spatial arrangement, and density on the extravasation of MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells.







Abstract
The adhesion of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) to the endothelial lumen and their extravasation to surrounding tissues are crucial in the seeding of metastases and remain the most complex events of the metastatic cascade to study. Integrins expressed on CTCs are major regulators of the extravasation process. This knowledge is primarily derived from animal models and biomimetic systems based on artificial endothelial layers, but these methods have ethical or technical limitations. We present a versatile microfluidic device to study cancer cell extravasation that mimics the endothelial barrier by using a porous membrane functionalized with DNA origami nanostructures (DONs) that display nanoscale patterns of adhesion peptides to circulating cancer cells. The device simulates physiological flow conditions and allows direct visualization of cell transmigration through microchannel pores using 3D confocal imaging. Using this system, we studied integrin&#8208;specific adhesion in the absence of other adhesive events. Specifically, we show that the transmigration ability of the metastatic cancer cell line MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 is influenced by the type, distance, and density of adhesion peptides present on the DONs. Furthermore, studies with mixed ligand systems indicate that integrins binding to RGD (arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartic acid) and IDS (isoleucine&#8208;aspartic acid&#8208;serine) did not synergistically enhance the extravasation process of MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells.

         <title>Ligand Meta&#8208;Anchoring Strategy in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Remarkable Promotion of Quantum Yields</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ligand meta&#8208;anchoring strategy is reported to promote the quantum yields of luminescent metal&#8211;organic frameworks through the restriction of intramolecular motions.







Abstract
Aggregation is a conventional method to enhance the quantum yields (QYs) of pure organic luminophores due to the restriction of intramolecular motions (RIM). However, how to realize RIM in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is still unclear and challenging. In this work, the ligand meta&#8208;anchoring strategy is first proposed and proved to be an effective and systematic approach to restrict the intramolecular motions of MOFs for the QY improvement. By simply shifting the substituent position in the ligand from para to meta, the QY of the resulting MOF is significantly enhanced by eleven&#8208;fold. The value is even higher than that of ligand aggregates, demonstrating the strong RIM effect of this ligand meta&#8208;anchoring strategy. The introduction of co&#8208;ligand induces the appearance of visible yellow room temperature phosphorescence with a lifetime of 222&#8197;ms due to the QY enhancement and the charge transfer between the donor and accepter units. The present work thus broadens the understanding of the RIM mechanism from a new perspective, develops a novel method to realize RIM and expands the applicable objects from pure organic materials to organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid materials.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Enhanced Photoreforming of Biomass Furans over a Urea&#8208;Incorporated Cu(II) Porphyrin Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A urea&#8208;incorporated porphyrin framework can activate molecular oxygen to generate selectively &#8901;O2&#8722; and 1O2 and enable the flat adsorption of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural in a low&#8208;energy configuration leveraging on hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, leading to highly efficient photo&#8208;oxidation that produces bioplastic monomers from renewable feedstocks without over&#8208;oxidation and photo&#8208;corrosion.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven upgrading of biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;hydroxylmethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) holds great promise for sustainable production of bio&#8208;plastics and resins. However, the process is limited by poor selectivity and sluggish kinetics due to the vertical coordination of HMF at relatively strong metal sites. Here, we purposely developed a Cu(II) porphyrin framework featuring side&#8208;chain incorporated urea linkages, denoted as TBUPP&#8722;Cu MOF, to render HMF a weak hydrogen bond at the urea site and flat adsorption via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking with the benzene moiety. The unique configuration promotes the approaching of &#8722;CHO of HMF to the photoexcited porphyrin ring towards kinetically and thermodynamically favourable intermediate formation and subsequent desorption. The charge localisation and orbital energy alignment enable the selective activation of O2 over the porphyrin to generate &#8901;O2&#8722; and 1O2 instead of highly oxidative H2O2 and &#8901;OH via spin&#8208;flip electron transfer, which drive the ambient oxidation of proximal &#8722;CHO. The effective utilisation of redox species and circumvented over&#8208;oxidation facilitate a FDCA selectivity of &gt;90&#8201;% with a high turnover number of 193&#8197;molHMF&#8201;molCu&#8722;1. The facile purification of high&#8208;purity FDCA and zero&#8208;waste recycling of intermediates and durable catalyst feature TBUPP&#8722;Cu MOF a promising photo&#8208;oxidation platform towards net&#8208;zero biorefining and organic transformations.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;up Growth of Convex Sphere with Adjustable Cu(0)/Cu(I) Interfaces for Effective C2 Production from CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tightly&#8208;coupled adjustable Cu(0)/Cu(I) interface manufactured by a bottom&#8208;up growth strategy exhibits outstanding selectivity and stability of CO2RR. The convex sphere with the favorable Cu(0)/Cu(I) interface promotes the dimerization of localized *CO adsorbate, thus form the C2 products with a lowered energy barrier.







Abstract
One challenge confronting the Cu2O catalysts in the electrocatalysis of carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) is the reduction of active Cu(I) species, resulting in low selectivity and quick deactivation. In this study, we for the first time introduce a bottom&#8208;up growth of convex sphere with adjustable Cu(0)/Cu(I) interfaces (Cux@Cu2O convex spheres). Interestingly, the interfaces are dynamically modulated by varying hydrothermal time, thus regulating the conversion of C1 and C2 products. In particular, the 4&#8197;h hydrothermal treatment applied to Cu0.25@Cu2O convex sphere with the favorable Cu(0)/Cu(I) interface results in the highest selectivity for C2 products (90.5&#8201;%). In situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations reveal that the Cu(0)/Cu(I) interface lowers the energy barrier for the production of ethylene and ethanol while increasing the coverage of localized *CO adsorbate for increased dimerization. This work establishes a novel approach for transforming the state of valence&#8208;sensitive electrocatalysts into high&#8208;value energy&#8208;related engineering products.

         <title>Thermal&#8208;Driven Dispersion of Bismuth Nanoparticles among Carbon Matrix for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique thermal&#8208;driven strategy is proposed to re&#8208;disperse bismuth core into nanoparticles among porous carbon shell, inhibiting the aggregation to enhance the electrocatalytic activity and stability.







Abstract
The poor electrocatalytic stability and rapid deactivation of metal electrocatalysts are always present in the electrocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) due to the harsh reduction condition. Herein, we demonstrate the controllable dispersion of ultrafine bismuth nanoparticles among the hollow carbon shell (Bi@C&#8208;700&#8208;4) simply by a thermal&#8208;driven diffusion process. The confinement effect of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix is able to low the surface energy of bismuth nanoparticles against the easy aggregation commonly observed for the thermal treatment. On the basis of the synergistic effect and confinement effect between bismuth nanoparticles and carbon matrix, the highly dispersed active sites render the obviously improved electrocatalytic activity and stability for CO2 reduction into formate. The in situ experimental observations on the reduction process and theoretical calculations reveal that the incorporation of bismuth nanoparticles with nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix would promote the activation of CO2 and the easy formation of key intermediate (*OCHO), thus leading the enhanced electrocatalytic activity, with a Faradaic Efficiency (FE) of formate about 94.8&#8201;% and the long&#8208;time stability. Furthermore, the coupling of an anode for 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) in solar&#8208;driven system renders the high 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) yield of 81.2&#8201;%, presenting the impressive solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.

         <title>Kinase Inhibition via Small Molecule&#8208;Induced Intramolecular Protein Cross&#8208;Linking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report ynamide&#8208;based, small&#8208;molecule inhibitors capable of inducing intramolecular cross&#8208;linking of kinases, leading to subsequent irreversible inhibition of kinase activity. This strategy exploits the close distance between highly conserved catalytic K and E/D residues present in almost all protein kinases, thus providing a conceptually general approach to achieve irreversible kinase inhibition with high specificity and cellular potency.







Abstract
Remarkable progress has been made in the development of cysteine&#8208;targeted covalent inhibitors. In kinase drug discovery, covalent inhibitors capable of targeting other nucleophilic residues (i.e. lysine, or K) have emerged in recent years. Besides a highly conserved catalytic lysine, almost all human protein kinases possess an equally conserved glutamate/aspartate (e.g. E/D) that forms a K&#8211;E/D salt bridge within the enzyme's active site. Electrophilic ynamides were previously used as effective peptide coupling reagents and to develop E/D&#8208;targeting covalent protein inhibitors/probes. In the present study, we report the first ynamide&#8208;based small&#8208;molecule inhibitors capable of inducing intramolecular cross&#8208;linking of various protein kinases, leading to subsequent irreversible inhibition of kinase activity. Our strategy took advantage of the close distance between the highly conserved catalytic K and E/D residues in a targeted kinase, thus providing a conceptually general approach to achieve irreversible kinase inhibition with high specificity and desirable cellular potency. Finally, this ynamide&#8208;facilitated, ligand&#8208;induced mechanism leading to intramolecular kinase cross&#8208;linking and inhibition was unequivocally established by using recombinant ABL kinase as a representative.

Cyclotetramerization of 2&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;3&#8208;aryl&#8208;pyrroles affords a novel class of C4&#8208;symmetric Caryl&#8722;C&#946; (C3, C8, C13, C18) axially chiral porphyrins in good yields. Both regioisomers of the Ir&#8208;complex catalyze efficiently the carbene C(sp3)&#8722;H insertion reaction.







Abstract
A hitherto unknown class of C4&#8208;symmetric Caryl&#8722;C&#946; (C3, C8, C13, C18) axially chiral porphyrins has been synthesized and the application of their iridium (Ir) complexes in catalytic asymmetric C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization is documented. Cyclotetramerization of enantioenriched axially chiral 2&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;3&#8208;naphthyl pyrroles under mild acidic conditions affords, after oxidation with 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ), the C4&#8208;symmetric &#945;,&#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;atropenantiomer as an only isolable diastereomer. Both regioisomeric Ir(Por*)(CO)(Cl) complexes catalyze the carbene C&#8722;H insertion reaction affording the same enantiomer, albeit with slight difference in enantioselectivity. With the optimum Ir&#8208;complex 3&#8201;e, the 2&#8208;substituted arylacetic acid derivatives were generated from diazo compounds and cyclohexadiene in excellent yields and enantioselectivities.

         <title>Highly Condensed and Super&#8208;Incompressible Be2PN3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Be&#8208;containing nitrides are sparsely investigated. The herein presented Be2PN3 expands the synthetic approach to highly condensed beryllium nitrides under high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature conditions. The comprehensive analytic combines powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, 9Be and 31P solid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy as well as infrared spectroscopy, among others. Density Functional Theory calculations reveal super&#8208;incompressible behavior.







Abstract
Although beryllium and its compounds show outstanding properties, owing to its toxic potential and extreme reaction conditions the chemistry of Be under high&#8208;pressure conditions has only been investigated sparsely. Herein, we report on the highly condensed wurtzite&#8208;type Be2PN3, which was synthesized from Be3N2 and P3N5 in a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature approach at 9&#8197;GPa and 1500&#8201;&#176;C. It is the missing member in the row of formula type M2PN3 (M&#160;=&#160;Mg, Zn). The structure was elucidated by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), revealing that Be2PN3 is a double nitride, rather than a nitridophosphate. The structural model was further corroborated by 9Be and 31P solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. We present 9Be NMR data for tetrahedral nitride coordination for the first time. Infrared and energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (FTIR and EDX), as well as temperature dependent PXRD complement the analytical characterization. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal super&#8208;incompressible behavior and the remarkable hardness of this low&#8208;density material. The formation of Be2PN3 through a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature approach expands the synthetic access to Be&#8208;containing compounds and may open access to various multinary beryllium nitrides.

&lt;p&gt;Be-containing nitrides are sparsely investigated. The herein presented Be&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; expands the synthetic approach to highly condensed beryllium nitrides under high-pressure high-temperature conditions. The comprehensive analytic combines powder X-ray diffraction, &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;Be and &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P solid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy as well as infrared spectroscopy, among others. Density Functional Theory calculations reveal super-incompressible behavior.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although beryllium and its compounds show outstanding properties, owing to its toxic potential and extreme reaction conditions the chemistry of Be under high-pressure conditions has only been investigated sparsely. Herein, we report on the highly condensed wurtzite-type Be&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which was synthesized from Be&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; in a high-pressure high-temperature approach at 9&#8197;GPa and 1500&#8201;&#176;C. It is the missing member in the row of formula type &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;M&#160;&lt;/i&gt;=&#160;Mg, Zn). The structure was elucidated by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), revealing that Be&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is a double nitride, rather than a nitridophosphate. The structural model was further corroborated by &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;Be and &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. We present &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;Be NMR data for tetrahedral nitride coordination for the first time. Infrared and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (FTIR and EDX), as well as temperature dependent PXRD complement the analytical characterization. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal super-incompressible behavior and the remarkable hardness of this low-density material. The formation of Be&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; through a high-pressure high-temperature approach expands the synthetic access to Be-containing compounds and may open access to various multinary beryllium nitrides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Ligand&#8208;Concentration Mediating Asymmetric Transformations of Silver Nanoclusters: NIR&#8208;II Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence Lighting</title>

Chiral ligand&#8208;concentration mediating asymmetric transformations of silver nanoclusters realize visible and second near&#8208;infrared circularly polarized phosphorescences.







Abstract
Near infrared (NIR) emitter with circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP), known as NIR CPP, has emerged as a key part in the research of cutting&#8208;edge luminescent materials. However, it remains a challenge to obtain nanoclusters with NIR CPP activity. Here, we propose an asymmetric transformation approach to efficiently synthesize two pairs of chiral silver nanoclusters (R/S&#8208;Ag29 and R/S&#8208;Ag16) using an achiral Ag10 nanocluster as starting material in the presence of different concentration chiral inducer (R/S)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diyl hydrogenphosphate (R/S&#8208;BNP). R/S&#8208;Ag29, formed in the low&#8208;concentration R/S&#8208;BNP, exhibits a unique kernel&#8208;shell structure consisting of a distorted Ag13 icosahedron and an integrated cage&#8208;like organometallic shell with a C3 symmetry, and possesses a superatomic 6&#8208;electron configuration (1S2|1P4). By contrast, R/S&#8208;Ag16, formed in the high&#8208;concentration R/S&#8208;BNP, features a sandwich&#8208;like pentagram with AgI&#8208;pure kernel. Profiting from the hierarchically chiral structures and superatomic kernel&#8208;dominated phosphorescence, R/S&#8208;Ag29 exhibits infrequent CPP activity in the second near&#8208;infrared (975&#8197;nm) region, being the first instance of NIR&#8208;II CPP observed among CPL&#8208;active metal nanoclusters. This study presents a new approach to reduce the difficulty of de novo synthesis for chiral silver nanomaterials, and facilitates the design of CPP&#8208;active superatomic nanoclusters in NIR region.

         <title>Kinetic Resolution Polymerization Enabled Chemical Synthesis of Perfectly Isotactic Polythioesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of chemically synthetic methods to prepare isotactic polythioesters (PTEs) has been a formidable challenge. Here we report the successful synthesis of a perfectly isotactic PTE via stereocontrolled ring&#8208;opening polymerization catalysed by binaphthalene&#8208;salen aluminium (SalBinam&#8208;Al). This kinetic resolution polymerization enabled the facile isolation of enantiopure monomer, which could efficiently convert to an important pharmaceutical building block.







Abstract
Isotactic polythioesters (PTEs) that are thioester analogs to natural polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) have attracted growing attention due to their distinct properties. However, the development of chemically synthetic methods for preparing isotactic PTEs has long been an intricate endeavour. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of perfectly isotactic PTEs via stereocontrolled ring&#8208;opening polymerization. This binaphthalene&#8208;salen aluminium (SalBinam&#8208;Al) catalyst promoted a robust polymerization of rac&#8208;&#945;&#8208;substituted&#8208;&#946;&#8208;propiothiolactones (rac&#8208;BTL and rac&#8208;PTL) with highly kinetic resolution, affording perfectly isotactic P(BTL) and P(PTL) with Mn up to 276&#8197;kDa. Impressively, the isotactic P(BTL) formed a supramolecular stereocomplex with improved thermal property (Tm=204&#8201;&#176;C). Ultimately, this kinetic resolution polymerization enabled the facile isolation of enantiopure (S)&#8208;BTL, which could efficiently convert to an important pharmaceutical building block (S)&#8208;2&#8208;benzyl&#8208;3&#8208;mercapto&#8208;propanoic acid. Isotactic P(PTL) served as a tough and ductile material comparable to the commercialized polyolefins. This synthetic system allowed to access of isotactic PTEs, establishing a powerful platform for the discovery of sustainable plastics.

         <title>2D Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Bearing Large Pore Apertures and Multiple Active Sites for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two mesoporous 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (PA&#8208;TAPA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF and PA&#8208;PyTTA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF) were synthesized as cathode host materials for polyiodides in aqueous dual&#8208;ion batteries. Among them, PA&#8208;TAPA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF, distinguished by the largest pore size (3.9&#8197;nm) among reported 2D c&#8208;MOFs, demonstrated higher specific capacity (423.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 100&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and exceptional cycling performance (maintaining 96&#8201;% capacity over 1000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1).







Abstract
2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) with large pore sizes and high surface areas are advantageous for adsorbing iodine species to enhance the electrochemical performance of aqueous dual&#8208;ion batteries (ADIBs). However, most of the reported 2D c&#8208;MOFs feature microporous structures, with few examples exhibiting mesoporous characteristics. Herein, we developed two mesoporous 2D c&#8208;MOFs, namely PA&#8208;TAPA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF and PA&#8208;PyTTA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF, using newly designed arylimide based multitopic catechol ligands (6OH&#8208;PA&#8208;TAPA and 8OH&#8208;PA&#8208;PyTTA). Notably, PA&#8208;TAPA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF exhibits the largest pore sizes (3.9&#8197;nm) among all reported 2D c&#8208;MOFs. Furthermore, we demonstrated that these 2D c&#8208;MOFs can serve as promising cathode host materials for polyiodides in ADIBs for the first time. The incorporation of triphenylamine moieties in PA&#8208;TAPA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF resulted in a higher specific capacity (423.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 100&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and superior cycling performance, retaining 96&#8201;% capacity over 1000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 compared to PA&#8208;PyTTA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF. Our comparative analysis revealed that the increased number of N anchoring sites and larger pore size in PA&#8208;TAPA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF facilitate efficient anchoring and conversion of I3&#8722;, as supported by spectroscopic electrochemistry and density functional theory calculations.

         <title>A New Family of High Oxidation State Antiperovskite Nitrides: La3MN5 (M=Cr, Mn and Mo)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
La3MN5 (M=Cr, Mn, and Mo) are the first examples of ternary antiperovskite (Cs3CoCl5&#8208;type) nitrides containing [MN4]6&#8722; anions for M=Cr and Mo, but for M=Mn off&#8208;stoichiometry modelled by excess&#8208;nitride clusters gives La3MnN5.30 with Mn oxidised almost to the +7 state. This is the first report of excess&#8208;anion incorporation into Cs3CoCl5&#8208;type materials, and this or other mechanisms may enable many other high oxidation state transition metal nitrides to be prepared.







Abstract
Three new nitrides La3MN5 (M=Cr, Mn, and Mo) have been synthesized using a high pressure azide route. These are the first examples of ternary Cs3CoCl5&#8208;type nitrides, and show that this (MN4)NLa3 antiperovskite structure type may be used to stabilise high oxidation&#8208;state transition metals in tetrahedral molecular [MN4]n&#8722; nitridometallate anions. Magnetic measurements confirm that Cr and Mo are in the M6+ state, but the M=Mn phase has an anomalously small paramagnetic moment and large cell volume. Neutron powder diffraction data are fitted using an anion&#8208;excess La3MnN5.30 model (space group I4/mcm, a=6.81587(9)&#8197;&#197; and c=11.22664(18)&#8197;&#197; at 200&#8197;K) in which Mn is close to the +7 state. Excess&#8208;anion incorporation into Cs3CoCl5&#8208;type materials has not been previously reported, and this or other substitution mechanisms may enable many other high oxidation state transition metal nitrides to be prepared.

         <title>Design of Solid Polycationic Electrolyte to Enable Durable Chloride&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a room&#8208;temperature chloride&#8208;ion battery based on a low&#8208;cost Al metal anode supported by a solid polycation electrolyte. This polycation electrolyte tailors a coordination structure that facilitates ions transport and eliminates hazard issues, thus enabling Al||FeOCl cells with high capacity, excellent interfacial compatibility, and long lifespan.







Abstract
The high energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness of chloride&#8208;ion batteries (CIBs) make them promising alternatives to lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the development of CIBs is greatly restricted by the lack of compatible electrolytes to support cost&#8208;effective anodes. Herein, we present a rationally designed solid polycationic electrolyte (SPE) to enable room&#8208;temperature chloride&#8208;ion batteries utilizing aluminum (Al) metal as an anode. This SPE endows the CIB configuration with improved air stability and safety (i.e. free of flammability and liquid leakage). A high ionic conductivity (1.3&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C) has been achieved by the well&#8208;tailored coordination structure of the SPE. Meanwhile, the solid polycationic electrolyte ensures stable electrodes|electrolyte interfaces, which effectively inhibit the growth of dendrites on the Al anodes and degradation of the FeOCl cathodes. The Al|SPE|FeOCl chloride&#8208;ion batteries showcased a high discharge capacity around 250&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (based on the cathodes) and extended lifespan. Our electrolyte design opens a new avenue for developing low&#8208;cost chloride&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Molecular Wiring of Electrocatalytic Nitrate reduction to Ammonia and Water Oxidation by Iron&#8208;Coordinated Macroporous Conductive Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general approach for synthesis of single&#8208;site active iron electrocatalysts is reported by integration of a solvated iron complex in conductive organic networks. Sufficient coordinatively unsaturated active sites can be created electrochemically for simultaneous NO3&#8722; reduction to NH3 and H2O oxidation to O2 in basic media.







Abstract
Developing stable electrocatalysts with accessible isolated sites is desirable but highly challenging due to metal agglomeration and low surface stability of host materials. Here we report a general approach for synthesis of single&#8208;site Fe electrocatalysts by integrating a solvated Fe complex in conductive macroporous organic networks through redox&#8208;active coordination linkages. Electrochemical activation of the electrode exposes high&#8208;density coordinately unsaturated Fe sites for efficient adsorption and conversion of reaction substrates such as NO3&#8722; and H2O. Using the electrode with isolated active Fe sites, electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction and H2O oxidation can be coupled in a single cell to produce NH3 and O2 at Faradaic efficiencies of 97&#8201;% and 100&#8201;%, respectively. The electrode exhibits excellent robustness in electrocatalysis for 200&#8197;hours with small decrease in catalytic efficiencies. Both the maximized Fe&#8208;site efficiency and the microscopic localization effect of the conductive organic matrix contribute to the high catalytic performances, which provides new understandings in tuning the efficiencies of metal catalysts for high&#8208;performance electrocatalytic cells.

         <dc:description>
A class of (S)&#8208;H8&#8208;BINOL&#8208;derived chiral &#951;6&#8208;benzene ligands has been developed, which can coordinate with ruthenium(II) highly site&#8208;selectively.The related chiral ruthenium(II) catalysts proved highly effective for the asymmetric C&#8722;H activation of N&#8208;sulfonyl ketimines with alkynes, affording a series of chiral spirocyclic sultams in up to 99&#8201;% yield with up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
Given the tremendous success of (p&#8208;cymene)RuII&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation over the past 20&#8197;years, the community has long been aware that the development of chiral &#951;6&#8208;benzene (Ben) ligands should be a potent strategy for achieving the attractive but incredibly underdeveloped ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation. However, it has rarely been achieved due to the severe difficulty in developing proper chiral Ben ligands. In particular, designing chiral Ben ligands by connecting a benzene fragment to a chiral framework including benzene rings remained an unsolved challenge until this effort. Here we present a novel class of axially chiral Ben ligands derived from readily available (S)&#8208;5,5&#8242;,6,6&#8242;,7,7&#8242;,8,8&#8242;&#8208;octahydro&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol ((S)&#8208;H8&#8208;BINOL) in 4&#8211;8 steps. Notably, when coordinated with ruthenium, such chiral Ben ligand containing three benzene rings only forms one of the three possible isomeric BenRuII complexes. The related chiral BenRuII catalysts could effectively catalyze the asymmetric C&#8722;H activation of N&#8208;sulfonyl ketimines with alkynes, affording a range of chiral spirocyclic sultams in up to 99&#8201;% yield with up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee. These catalysts are expected to find broad applications in future.

         <title>Kinetic Control of Complexity in Multiple Dynamic Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report how all the components of two dynamic libraries generated by two reversible processes, were eventually funneled towards kinetically inert structures that contain parts from both libraries, causing a collapse of the complexity. Moreover, such intercommunication can be designed to be latent, and emergent supramolecular and luminescent properties could be modified by simply activating the communication.







Abstract
Multiple dynamic libraries of compounds are generated when more than one reversible reaction comes into play. Commonly, two or more orthogonal reversible reactions are used, leading to non&#8208;communicating dynamic libraries which share no building blocks. Only a few examples of communicating libraries have been reported, and in all those cases, building blocks are reversibly exchanged from one library to the other, constituting an antiparallel dynamic covalent system.

     alt="Kinetic Control of Complexity in Multiple Dynamic Libraries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report how all the components of two dynamic libraries generated by two reversible processes, were eventually funneled towards kinetically inert structures that contain parts from both libraries, causing a collapse of the complexity. Moreover, such intercommunication can be designed to be latent, and emergent supramolecular and luminescent properties could be modified by simply activating the communication.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple dynamic libraries of compounds are generated when more than one reversible reaction comes into play. Commonly, two or more orthogonal reversible reactions are used, leading to non-communicating dynamic libraries which share no building blocks. Only a few examples of communicating libraries have been reported, and in all those cases, building blocks are reversibly exchanged from one library to the other, constituting an antiparallel dynamic covalent system. Herein we report that communication between two different dynamic libraries through an irreversible process is also possible. Indeed, alkyl amines cancel the dynamic regime on the nucleophilic substitution of tetrazines, generating kinetically inert compounds. Interestingly, such amine can be part of another dynamic library, an imine-amine exchange. Thus, both libraries are interconnected with each other by an irreversible process which leads to kinetically inert structures that contain parts from both libraries, causing a collapse of the complexity. Additionally, a latent irreversible intercommunication could be developed. In such a way, a stable molecular system with specific host&#8211;guest and fluorescence properties, could be irreversibly transformed when the right stimulus was applied, triggering the cancellation of the original supramolecular and luminescent properties and the emergence of new ones.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Plasma&#8208;Driven Efficient Conversion of CO2 and H2O into Pure Syngas with Controllable Wide H2/CO Ratios over Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Featuring In Situ Evolved Ligand Defects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient plasma&#8208;driven catalytic conversion of CO2 and confined H2O into pure syngas with controllable wide H2/CO ratios is presented. The ligand defect&#8208;induced in situ dynamic structure evolution of porous MOF catalyst favors the generation of coordinatively unsaturated metal active sites with optimized geometric and electronic characteristics and the resultantly reduced energy barriers of syngas&#8208;production potential&#8208;determining steps.







Abstract
While the mild production of syngas (a mixture of H2 and CO) from CO2 and H2O is a promising alternative to the coal&#8208;based chemical engineering technologies, the inert nature of CO2 molecules, unfavorable splitting pathways of H2O and unsatisfactory catalysts lead to the challenge in the difficult integration of high CO2 conversion efficiency with produced syngas with controllable H2/CO ratios in a wide range. Herein, we report an efficient plasma&#8208;driven catalytic system for mild production of pure syngas over porous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) catalysts with rich confined H2O molecules, where their syngas production capacity is regulated by the in situ evolved ligand defects and the plasma&#8208;activated intermediate species of CO2 molecules. Specially, the Cu&#8208;based catalyst system achieves 61.9&#8201;% of CO2 conversion and the production of pure syngas with wide H2/CO ratios of 0.05&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8211;4.3&#8201;:&#8201;1. As revealed by the experimental and theoretical calculation results, the in situ dynamic structure evolution of Cu&#8208;containing MOF catalysts favors the generation of coordinatively unsaturated metal active sites with optimized geometric and electronic characteristics, the adsorption of reactants, and the reduced energy barriers of syngas&#8208;production potential&#8208;determining steps of the hydrogenation of CO2 to *COOH and the protonation of H2O to *H.

         <title>Dimensional Regulation in Metal&#8208;Free Perovskites by Compositional Engineering to Achieve Record Low X&#8208;Ray Detection Limits</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work innovatively utilizes compositional engineering to tailor octahedra, achieving a dimensional evolution in metal&#8208;free perovskites, and reports on metal&#8208;free perovskites with a two&#8208;dimensional structure for the first time. With the evolution in dimensions, there is a significant variation in their fluorescence and X&#8208;ray detection capabilities. Importantly, the 2D SC&#8208;based X&#8208;ray detector achieved an ultra&#8208;low LOD of 12.2&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
Utilizing the manipulation of perovskite dimensions has been proven as an effective approach in regulating perovskite properties. Nevertheless, achieving precise control over the dimensions of perovskites within the same system poses a significant challenge. In this study, we introduce a sophisticated method to attain precise dimensional control in metal&#8208;free perovskites (MFPs), specifically through the process of octahedron tailoring by compositional engineering. Accordingly, we successfully instigated a transition from HPIP&#8722;NH4I3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O (3D), HPIP2&#8722;NH4I5 (2D) and HPIP3&#8722;NH4I7 (1D) structures. Notably, HPIP2&#8722;NH4I5 is the first 2D MFP. As anticipated, these perovskites exhibited completely distinct fluorescence and X&#8208;ray detection capabilities due to their differing dimensions. Remarkably, the 2D HPIP2&#8722;NH4I5 device effectively hindered ion migration perpendicular to the 2D layers, achieving the lowest detection limit of 12.2&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1 among metal&#8208;free single crystals&#8208;based detectors. This study expands the dimensionality control strategies for MFPs and introduces, for the first time, the potential of 2D MFPs as high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray detectors, thereby enriching the diversity of the MFPs family.

         <title>Built&#8208;in Electric Fields in Heterostructured Lamellar Membranes Enable Highly Efficient Rejection of Charged Mass</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D nanochannels with built&#8208;in electric fields were constructed by assembling the heterostructured nanosheets to manipulate ion transport, achieving a high rejection of salts, dyes, and organic acids/bases and simultaneously ultrafast water transport, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art homogeneous charge nanochannel membranes.







Abstract
Separation membranes with homogeneous charge channels are the mainstream to reject charged mass by forming electrical double layer (EDL). However, the EDL often compresses effective solvent transport space and weakens channel&#8208;ion interaction. Here, built&#8208;in electric fields (BIEFs) are constructed in lamellar membranes by assembling the heterostructured nanosheets, which contain alternate positively&#8208;charged nanodomains and negatively&#8208;charged nanodomains. We demonstrate that the BIEFs are perpendicular to horizontal channel and the direction switches alternately, significantly weakening the EDL effect and forces ions to repeatedly collide with channel walls. Thus, highly efficient rejection for charged mass (salts, dyes, and organic acids/bases) and ultrafast water transport are achieved. Moreover, for desalination on four&#8208;stage filtration option, salt rejection reaches 99.9&#8201;% and water permeance reaches 19.2&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;bar&#8722;1. Such mass transport behavior is quite different from that in homogeneous charge channels. Furthermore, the ion transport behavior in nanochannels is elucidated by validating horizontal projectile motion model.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Redox&#8208;Neutral [3+2] Photocycloadditions of Cyclopropyl Ketones with Vinylazaarenes Enabled by Consecutive Photoinduced Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ConPET as a powerful and novel technique for photoredox catalysis has been first employed in asymmetric synthesis. In collaboration with chiral hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalysis, an unprecedented redox&#8208;neutral [3+2] photocycloaddition has been developed, facilitating the synthesis of a wide range of valuable azaarene&#8208;functionalized cyclopentyl ketones with high yields, ees and dr.







Abstract
Consecutive photoinduced electron transfer (ConPET) is a powerful and atom&#8208;economical protocol to overcome the limitations of the intrinsic redox potential of visible light&#8208;absorbing photosensitizers, thereby considerably improving the substrate and reaction types. Likely because such an exothermic single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) process usually does not require the aid of chiral catalysts, resulting in an inevitable racemic background reaction, notably, no enantioselective manifolds have been reported. Herein, we report on the viability of cooperative ConPET and chiral hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalysis for the [3+2] photocycloaddition of cyclopropyl ketones with vinylazaarenes. In addition to enabling the first use of olefins that preferentially interact with chiral catalysts, this catalysis platform paves the way for the efficient synthesis of pharmaceutically and synthetically important cyclopentyl ketones functionalized by azaarenes with high yields, ees and dr. The robust capacity of the method can be further highlighted by the low loading of the chiral catalyst (1.0&#8197;mol&#8201;%), the good compatibility of both 2&#8208;azaarene and 3&#8208;pyridine&#8208;based olefins, and the successful concurrent construction of three stereocenters on cyclopentane rings involving an elusive but important all&#8208;carbon quaternary.

The robust capacity of the method can be further highlighted by the low loading of the chiral catalyst (1.0&#8197;mol&#8201;%), the good compatibility of both 2-azaarene and 3-pyridine-based olefins, and the successful concurrent construction of three stereocenters on cyclopentane rings involving an elusive but important all-carbon quaternary.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Construction of Frustrated Lewis Pairs in Poly(heptazine imide) Nanosheets via Hydrogen Bonds for Boosting CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The creation of frustrated Lewis pairs on catalyst surface is an effective strategy for tuning CO2 activation. The critical step in the formation of frustrated Lewis pairs is the spatial effect of proximal Lewis acid&#8208;Lewis base pairs. Here, we demonstrate a facile surface functionalization methodology that enables hydrogen bonding between N and H atoms to mediate the construction of frustrated Lewis pairs in poly(heptazine imide), thereby increasing the propensity to activate CO2 molecules. Experimental and theoretical results show that the construction of active hydrogen bonding regions can facilitate the bending of CO2 molecules. Furthermore, the delocalization of electron clouds induced by the hydrogen bonding&#8208;mediated frustrated Lewis pairs can promote the heterolytic cleavage and photocatalytic conversion of CO2. This work highlights the potential of utilizing hydrogen bonding&#8208;mediated strategy in heterogeneously photocatalytic activation of CO2 over polymer materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Ionic Selectivity and Osmotic Energy by Using an Ultrathin Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;Based Heterogeneous Membrane with Trilayered Continuous Porous Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing a nanofluidic membrane with high selectivity and fast ion transport property is the key towards high&#8208;performance osmotic energy conversion. However, most of reported membranes can produce power density less than commercial benchmark (5 W/m2), due to the imbalance between ion selectivity and permeability. Here, we report a novel nanoarchitectured design of a heterogeneous membrane with an ultrathin and dense zirconium&#8208;based UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) layer and a highly aligned and interconnected branched alumina nanochannel membrane. The design leads to a continuous trilayered pore structure of large geometry gradient in the sequence from angstrom&#8208;scale to nano&#8208;scale to sub&#8208;microscale, which enables the enhanced directional ion transport, and the angstrom&#8208;sized (~6.6&#8208;7 &#197;) UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 windows render the membrane with high ion selectivity. Consequently, the novel heterogeneous membrane can achieve a high&#8208;performance power of ~8 W/m2 by mixing synthetic seawater and river water. The power density can be largely upgraded to an ultrahigh ~17.1 W/m2 along with ~48.5% conversion efficiency at a 50&#8208;fold KCl gradient. This work not only presents a new membrane design approach but also showcases the great potential of employing the zirconium&#8208;based MOF channels as ion&#8208;channel&#8208;mimetic membranes for highly efficient blue energy harvesting.</dc:description>

         <title>Continuous Transformation from Membrane&#8208;less Coacervates to Membranized Coacervates and Giant Vesicles: toward Multicompartmental Protocells with Complex (Membrane) Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The membranization of membrane&#8208;less coacervates paves the way for the exploitation of complex protocells with regard to structural and cell&#8208;like functional behaviors. However, the controlled transformation from membranized coacervates to vesicles remains a challenge. This can provide stable (multi)phase and (multi)compartmental architectures through the reconfiguration of coacervate droplets in the presence of (bioactive) polymers, bio(macro)molecules and/or nanoobjects. Herein, we present a continuous protocell transformation from membrane&#8208;less coacervates to membranized coacervates and, ultimately, to giant hybrid vesicles. This transformation process is orchestrated by altering the balance of non&#8208;covalent interactions through varying concentrations of an anionic terpolymer, leading to dynamic processes such as spontaneous membranization of terpolymer nanoparticles at the coacervate surface, disassembly of the coacervate phase mediated by the excess anionic charge, and the redistribution of coacervate components in membrane. The diverse protocells during the transformation course provide distinct structural features and molecular permeability. Notably, the introduction of multiphase coacervates in this continuous transformation process signifies advancements toward the creation of synthetic cells with different diffusible compartments. Our findings emphasize the highly controlled continuous structural reorganization of coacervate protocells and represents a novel step toward the development of advanced and sophisticated synthetic protocells with more precise compositions and complex (membrane) structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks (XOFs) Based on N&#8943;Br+&#8943;N Bonds: Robust Organic Networks Constructed by Fragile Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic frameworks face a trade&#8208;off between the framework stability and the bonds dynamics, which necessitates the development of innovative linkages that enable stable frameworks without hindering efficient synthesis. While iodine(I)&#8208;based halogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (XOFs) have been developed, constructing XOFs based on bromine(I) is desirable yet challenging due to the high sensitivity of bromine(I) species. Here, we present the inaugural construction of stable bromine(I)&#8208;bridged two&#8208;dimensional (2D) halogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks, XOF(Br)&#8208;TPy&#8208;BF4/OTf, based on sensitive [N&#8230;Br&#8230;N]+ halogen bonds. The formation of XOF(Br)&#8208;TPy&#8208;BF4/OTf was monitored by 1H NMR, XPS, IR, SEM, TEM, HR&#8208;TEM, SEAD. Their framework structures were established by the results from PXRD, theoretical simulations and SAXS. More importantly, XOF(Br)&#160;exhibited stable two&#8208;dimensional framework structures in various organic solvents and aqueous media, even over a wide pH range (pH 3&#8208;12), while the corresponding modelcompounds BrPy2BF4/OTf decomposed quickly even in the presence of minimal water. Furthermore, the influence of the counterions were investigated by replacing BF4 with OTf, which obviously improved the stability of XOF(Br). This characteristic enabled XOF(Br) to serve as efficient oxidizing reagents in aqueous environments, contrasting with the sensitivity of BrPy2BF4/OTf, which performed well only in organic media. This study opens new avenues for the development and application of multifunctional XOFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Spheroidization: The Impact of Precursor Morphology on Solid&#8208;State Lithiation Process for High&#8208;Quality Ultrahigh&#8208;Nickel Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered oxides with ultrahigh nickel content are considered promising high energy cathode materials. However, their cycle stability is constrained by a series of heterogeneous structural transformations during the complex solid&#8208;state lithiation process. By in&#8208;depth investigation into the solid&#8208;state lithiation process of LiNi0.92Co0.04Mn0.04O2, it is found that the protruded parts on the surface of precursor particles tend to be surrounded by locally excessive LiOH, which promotes the formation of a rigid and dense &#160;shell during the early stage of lithiation process. The shell will hinder the diffusion of lithium and topotactic lithiation within the particles, culminating in spatially heterogeneous intermediates that can impair the electrochemical properties of the cathode material. The spheroidization of the precursor can enhance uniformity in structural evolution during solid&#8208;phase lithiation. Ultrahigh nickel cathodes derived from spherical precursors demonstrate high initial discharge specific capacity (234.2 mAh g&#8208;1, in the range of 2.7&#8208;4.3V) and capacity retention (89.3% after 200 cycles), significantly superior to the non&#8208;spherical samples. This study not only sheds light on the intricate relationship between precursor shape and structural transformation but also introduces a novel strategy for enhancing cathode performance through precursor spheroidization.</dc:description>

         <title>Ion Current Rectification Activity Induced by Boron Hydride Nanosheets to Enhance Magnesium Analgesia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The low analgesic efficiency has limited magnesium used in analgesia. Here, we report boron hydride (BH) with ion current rectification activity can significantly improve the analgesic efficiency of magnesium, even higher than morphine. The synthesized injectable MgB2 composes of hexagonal boron sheets alternating with Mg2+. In pathological environment, while the intercalated Mg2+ will be exchanged by H+, the 2&#8208;dimensional borophene&#8208;analogue BH sheets will be formed to interact with the charged cations via the cation&#8208;pi interaction, synergistically leading to a sort of two&#8208;way dynamic modulation of sodium and potassium ion currents in neurons. By coordinating with the released Mg2+ to compete Ca2+, the threshold potential remarkably increases from the normal &#8208;35.9 mV to &#8208;5.9 mV, which significantly suppresses neuronal excitability, providing a potent analgesic effect. In three typical pain models&#160;, including CFA&#8208;induced inflammatory pain, PINP&#8208; or CCI&#8208;induced neuropathic pain, MgB2 demonstrates its analgesic efficiency&#160;approximately 2.23, 3.20, and 2.0 times higher than the clinical MgSO4, respectively. The development of MgB2 as analgesic drugs addresses the unmet medical need of pain relief without the risks of drug tolerance or addiction to opioids.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationships of the Structural Analogs Au8Cu1 and Au8Ag1 in the Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to the significant attention directed toward alloy metal nanoclusters, it is crucial to explore the relationship between their structures and their performance during the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) and discover potential synergistic effects for the design of novel functional nanoclusters. However, a lack of suitable analogs makes this investigation challenging. In this study, we synthesized and characterized a&#160; pair of structural analogs, [Au8Cu1(SAdm)4(Dppm)3Cl]2+ and [Au8Ag1(SAdm)4(Dppm)3Cl]2+ (Au8Cu1 and Au8Ag1, respectively). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed that Au8M1 consists of a tetrahedral Au3M1 core capped by three (Dppm)Au staples, one Au2(SR)3 staple, one lone SR ligand, and a terminal Cl ligand. Ag and Cu were doped at the same site . Au8Cu1 exhibited a significantly higher CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO; ~82.2%) during eCO2RR than that of Au8Ag1 (FECO; ~33.1%). DFT demonstrated that *COOH is the key intermediate in the reduction of CO2 to CO. The formation of *COOH on Au8Cu1 is more thermodynamically stable than on Au8Ag1, and Au8Cu1 shows a smaller *CO formation energy than that on Au8Ag1, which promotes the reduction of CO2. We believe that the structural analogs Au8Cu1 and Au8Ag1 offer a suitable template for the in&#8208;depth investigation of structure&#8208;property correlations at the atomic level.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of High&#8208;Capacity Sulfur Cathodes via In&#8208;Situ Polymerization of a Porous Imine&#8208;Based Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ polymerization techniques encapsulate sulfur within microporous imine polymers, addressing the sulfur&#8208;shuttle issue and boosting electrochemical performance. This innovative strategy marks a new direction for creating efficient sulfur&#8208;based cathodes in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries, essential for electronics and electric vehicles, predominantly use cathodes made from critical materials like cobalt. Sulfur&#8208;based cathodes, offering a high theoretical capacity of 1675&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and environmental advantages due to sulfur's abundance and lower toxicity, present a more sustainable alternative. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art sulfur&#8208;based electrodes do not reach the theoretical capacities, mainly because conventional electrode production relies on mixing of components into weakly coordinated slurries. Consequently, sulfur&#8216;s mobility leads to battery degradation&#8212;an effect known as the &#8220;sulfur&#8208;shuttle&#8221;. This study introduces a solution by developing a microporous, covalently&#8208;bonded, imine&#8208;based polymer network grown in situ around sulfur particles on the current collector. The polymer network (i) enables selective transport of electrolyte and Li&#8208;ions through pores of defined size, and (ii) acts as a robust host to retain the active component of the electrode (sulfur species). The resulting cathode has superior rate performance from 0.1&#8197;C (1360&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) to 3&#8197;C (807&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1). Demonstrating a high&#8208;performance, sustainable sulfur cathode produced via a simple one&#8208;pot process, our research underlines the potential of microporous polymers in addressing sulfur diffusion issues, paving the way for sulfur electrodes as viable alternatives to traditional metal&#8208;based cathodes.

         <title>Reversible Modulation of Plasmonic Coupling of Gold Nanoparticles Confined within Swellable Polymer Colloidal Spheres</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic optical modulation in response to stimuli provides exciting opportunities for designing novel sensing, actuating, and authentication devices. Here, we demonstrate that the reversible swelling and deswelling of crosslinked polymer colloidal spheres in response to pH and temperature changes can be utilized to drive the assembly and disassembly of the embedded gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), inducing their plasmonic coupling and decoupling and, correspondingly, color changes. The multi&#8208;responsive colloids are created by depositing a monolayer of AuNPs on the surface of resorcinol&#8208;formaldehyde (RF) nanospheres, then overcoating them with an additional RF layer, followed by a seeded growth process to enlarge the AuNPs and reduce their interparticle separation to induce significant plasmonic coupling. This configuration facilitates dynamic modulation of plasmonic coupling through the reversible swelling/deswelling of the polymer spheres in response to pH and temperature changes. The rapid and repeatable transitions between coupled and decoupled plasmonic states of AuNPs enable reversible color switching when the polymer spheres are in colloidal form or embedded in hydrogel substrates. Furthermore, leveraging the photothermal effect and stimuli&#8208;responsive plasmonic coupling of the embedded AuNPs enables the construction of hybrid hydrogel films featuring switchable anticounterfeiting patterns, showcasing the versatility and potential of this multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive plasmonic system.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalyzed Cascade Hydrogen Atom Transfers for Assembly of Multi&#8208;substituted &#945;&#8208;SCF3 and &#945;&#8208;SCF2H Cyclopentanones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photocatalyzed formal (3+2) cycloaddition has been developed to construct original polysubstituted &#945;&#8208;SCF3 cyclopentanones in a regio&#8208; and diastereoselective manner. This building block approach leverages trifluoromethylthio alkynes and branched / linear aldehydes, as readily available reaction partners, in consecutive hydrogen atom transfers and C&#8211;C bond formations. Difluoromethylthio alkynes are also compatible subtrates. Furthermore, the potential for telescoped reaction starting from alcohols instead of aldehydes was demonstrated, as well as process automatization and scale&#8208;up under continuous microflow conditions. This prompted density functional theory calculations to support a free radical&#8208;mediated cascade hydrogen atom transfer process.</dc:description>

Furthermore, the potential for telescoped reaction starting from alcohols instead of aldehydes was demonstrated, as well as process automatization and scale-up under continuous microflow conditions. This prompted density functional theory calculations to support a free radical-mediated cascade hydrogen atom transfer process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unsymmetric Chiral Ligands for Large Metallo&#8208;Macrocycles: Selectivity of Orientational Self&#8208;Sorting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nature uses various chiral and unsymmetric building blocks to form substantial and complex supramolecular assemblies. In contrary, majority of organic ligands used in metallosupramolecular chemistry are symmetric and achiral. Here we extend on the group of unsymmetric chiral bile acids used as a scaffold for organic bispyridyl ligands employing the chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), epimer of previously used ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Ligands&#8217; epimerism, flexibility, and bulkiness leads to large structural differences of coordination products upon reaction with Pd(NO3)2. The UDCA&#8208;bispyridyl ligand self&#8208;assembles quantitatively into a single crown&#8208;like Pd3L6 complex, whereas the CDCA&#8208;ligand provides a mixture of coordination complexes of general formula PdnL2n, i.e., Pd2L4, Pd3L6, Pd4L8, Pd5L10, and even Pd6L12 containing impressive 120 chiral centers. The coordination products were studied by a combination of analytical methods, where the ion mobility&#8208;mass spectrometry (IM&#8208;MS) provided valuable details on their structure and allowed an effective separation of m/z 1461 to individual signals according to arrival time distribution, revealing four different ions of [Pd3L6(NO3)3]3+, [Pd4L8(NO3)4]4+, [Pd5L10(NO3)5]5+, and [Pd6L12(NO3)6]6+. The structures of all complexes were modelled using DFT calculations. Finally, challenges and conclusions in determination of specific structural identity of these unsymmetric species are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Inherently Chiral Calix[4]arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inherently chiral&#160;calix[4]arenes&#160;are&#160;an excellent structural scaffold&#160;for asymmetric synthesis, chiral recognition,&#160;sensing, and circularly polarized luminescence. However,&#160;their&#160;catalytic asymmetric synthesis remains challenging. Herein, we report an efficient synthesis of inherently chiral calix[4]arene&#160;derivatives via cascade asymmetric cyclization and oxidation reactions. The three&#8208;component&#160;reaction features a broad substrate scope (33 examples), high efficiency (up to 90% yield), and excellent enantioselectivity (&gt;95%&#160;ee on average). The potential applications of calix[4]arene&#160;derivatives&#160;are highlighted by their&#160;synthetic transformation and a detailed investigation of their photophysical and chiroptical properties.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A heterometallic and paramagnetic one&#8208;dimensional aligned chain in &#8211;Rh(+2)&#8211;Rh(+2)&#8211;Pt(+2)&#8211;Ni(+2)&#8211;Pt(+2)&#8211; with direct metal&#8211;metal bonds was obtained via HOMO&#8211;LUMO interactions at the &#963;* (dz2) orbital between [Rh2(O2CCH3)4] and [Pt2Ni(piam)4(NH3)4] (piam = pivalamidate).

         <title>Radical&#8208;Induced Changes in Transition Metal Interfacial Magnetic Properties: A Blatter Derivative on Polycrystalline Cobalt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we study the interface obtained by depositing a monolayer of a Blatter radical derivative on polycrystalline cobalt. By examining the occupied and unoccupied states at the interface, using soft X&#8208;ray techniques, combined with electronic structure calculations, we could simultaneously determine the electronic structure of both the molecular and ferromagnetic sides of the interface, thus obtaining a full understanding of the interfacial magnetic properties. We found that the molecule is strongly hybridized with the surface. Changes in the core level spectra reflect the modification of the molecule and the cobalt electronic structures inducing a decrease in the magnetic moment of the cobalt atoms bonded to the molecules which, in turn, lose their radical character. Our method allowed us to screen, beforehand, organic/ferromagnetic interfaces in view of their potential applications in spintronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerating Anhydrous Proton Transport in Covalent Organic Frameworks: Pore Chemistry and Its Impacts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton conduction is important in both fundamental research and technological development. Here we report designed synthesis of crystalline porous covalent organic frameworks as a new platform for high&#8208;rate anhydrous proton conduction. By developing nanochannels with different topologies as proton pathways and loading neat phosphoric acid to construct robust proton carrier networks in the pores, we found that pore topology is crucial for proton conduction. Its effect on increasing proton conductivity is in an exponential mode other than linear fashion, endowing the materials with exceptional proton conductivities exceeding 10&#8211;2 S cm&#8211;1 over a broad range of temperature and a low activation energy barrier down to 0.24 eV. Remarkably, the pore size controls conduction mechanism, where mesopores promote proton conduction via a fast&#8208;hopping mechanism, while micropores follow a sluggish vehicle process. Notably, decreasing phosphoric acid loading content drastically reduces proton conductivity and greatly increases activation energy barrier, emphasizing the pivotal role of well&#8208;developed proton carrier network in proton transport. These findings and insights unveil a new general and transformative guidance for designing porous framework materials and systems for high&#8208;rate ion conduction, energy storage, and energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Super Hydrous Solvated Structure of Chaotropic Ca2+ Contributes Superior Anti&#8208;Freezing Aqueous Electrolytes and Stabilizes the Zn anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The further development of aqueous zinc (Zn)&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) is constrained by the high freezing points and the instability on Zn anodes. Current improvement strategies mainly focus on regulating hydrogen bond (HB) donors (H) of solvent water to disrupt HBs, while neglecting the environment of HB&#8208;acceptors (O). Herein, we propose a mechanism of chaotropic cation&#8208;regulated HB&#8208;acceptor via a &#8220;super hydrous solvated&#8221; structure. Chaotropic Ca2+ can form a solvated structure via competitively binding O atoms in H2O, effectively breaking the HBs among H2O molecules, thereby reducing the freezing point of hybrid 1 mol L&#8208;1 (M) ZnCl2 + 4 M CaCl2 electrolyte (&#8208;113.2 &#176;C). Meanwhile, the high hydratability of Ca2+ contributes to the water&#8208;poor solvated structure of Zn2+, suppressing side reactions and uneven Zn deposition. Benefiting from the anti&#8208;freezing electrolyte and high reversible Zn anode, the Zn||Pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone (PTO) batteries deliver an ultrahigh capacity of 183.9 mAh g&#8208;1 at 1.0 A g&#8208;1 over 1600&#8208;time stable cycling at &#8208;60 &#176;C. This work presents a cheap and efficient aqueous electrolyte to simultaneously improve low&#8208;temperature performances and Zn stability, broadening the design concepts for antifreeze electrolytes.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The further development of aqueous zinc (Zn)-ion batteries (AZIBs) is constrained by the high freezing points and the instability on Zn anodes. Current improvement strategies mainly focus on regulating hydrogen bond (HB) donors (H) of solvent water to disrupt HBs, while neglecting the environment of HB-acceptors (O). Herein, we propose a mechanism of chaotropic cation-regulated HB-acceptor via a &#8220;super hydrous solvated&#8221; structure. Chaotropic Ca2+ can form a solvated structure via competitively binding O atoms in H2O, effectively breaking the HBs among H2O molecules, thereby reducing the freezing point of hybrid 1 mol L-1 (M) ZnCl2 + 4 M CaCl2 electrolyte (-113.2 &#176;C). Meanwhile, the high hydratability of Ca2+ contributes to the water-poor solvated structure of Zn2+, suppressing side reactions and uneven Zn deposition. Benefiting from the anti-freezing electrolyte and high reversible Zn anode, the Zn||Pyrene-4,5,9,10-tetraone (PTO) batteries deliver an ultrahigh capacity of 183.9 mAh g-1 at 1.0 A g-1 over 1600-time stable cycling at -60 &#176;C. This work presents a cheap and efficient aqueous electrolyte to simultaneously improve low-temperature performances and Zn stability, broadening the design concepts for antifreeze electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailoring the Degradation of Cyano&#8208;arene based Photocatalysts for Enhanced Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Halogen Atom Transfer Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the strategic design of donor&#8208;acceptor cyanoarene&#8208;based photocatalysts (PCs) aiming to augment beneficial PC degradation for halogen atom transfer (XAT)&#8208;induced dehalogenation reactions.&#160;Our investigation reveals a competitive nature between the catalytic cycle and the degradation pathway, with degradation becoming dominant, particularly for less activated alkyl halides. The degradation behavior of PCs significantly impacts the efficiency of the XAT process, leading to exploration into manipulating the degradation behavior in a desirable direction. Recognizing the variation in the nature and rate of PC degradation, as well as its influence on the reaction across the range of PC structures, we carefully engineered the PCs to develop&#160;a pre&#8208;catalyst, named 3DP&#8208;DCDP&#8208;IPN. This pre&#8208;catalyst undergoes rapid degradation into an active form, 3DP&#8208;DCDP&#8208;Me&#8208;BN, exhibited an enhanced reducing ability in its radical anion form to induce better PC regeneration and consequently effectively catalyzes the XAT reaction, even with a challenging substrate.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding Ligand Effects on Bielectronic Transitions: Chemo&#8208; and Electroreduction of Rhodium Bis(Diphosphine) Complexes to Low Oxidation States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rhodium complexes in the &#8211;I and 0 oxidation states are of great potential interest in catalytic applications. In contrast to their rhodium +I congeners, however, the structural and electronic parameters governing their access and stability are far less understood. Herein, we investigate the two&#8208;electron reduction of a parameterized series of bis(diphosphine) Rh complexes [Rh(dxpy)2]NTf2 (x = P&#8208;substituent, y = alkanediyl bridging P atoms). Through (electro)reductions from the RhI parents, Rh&#8211;I&#160;d10&#8208;complexes were obtained and characterized spectroscopically, including 103Rh NMR data. The reductive steps convolute with structural rearrangements from square planar to tetrahedral coordination. We found that the extent of these reorganisations defines whether the first E0(RhI/0) and second E0(Rh0/&#8211;I) reduction potentials are normally ordered, leading to monoelectronic stepwise events, or inverted, giving bielectronic transitions. Reductionist approaches based on Hammett parameters or the P&#8208;Rh&#8208;P bite angles provide only partial correlations with the redox potentials. However, we identified the C&#8208;O stretch of analogue diphosphine complexes as an expedient computational parameter that enables these correlations through both electronic and geometric features, even in a predictive manner. Gaining control over two&#8208;electron reduction behaviors through rationalized ligand effects has potential impact beyond Rh complexes, for molecular and enzymatic metal sites commonly exhibiting bielectronic transitions.</dc:description>

         <title>Artificial Channels Based on Bottlebrush Polymers: Enhanced Ion Transport Through Polymer Topology Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic structures mimicking the transport function of natural ion channel proteins have a wide range of applications, including therapeutic treatments, separation membranes, sensing, and biotechnologies. However, the development of polymer&#8208;based artificial channels has been hampered due to the limitation on available models. In this study, we demonstrate the great potential of bottlebrush polymers as accessible and versatile molecular scaffolds for developing efficient artificial ion channels. Adopting the bottlebrush configuration enhanced ion transport activity of the channels compared to their linear analogs. Matching the structure of lipid bilayers, the bottlebrush channel with a hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic&#8208;hydrophilic triblock architecture exhibited the highest activity among the series. Functionalized with urea groups, these channels displayed high anion selectivity. Additionally, we illustrated that the transport properties could be fine&#8208;tuned by modifying the chemistry of ion binding sites. This work not only highlights the importance of polymer topology control in channel design, but also reveals the great potential for further developing bottlebrush channels with customized features and diverse functionalities.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Voltage Catholyte for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Nonaqueous Redox Flow Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox flow batteries (RFBs) with high energy densities are essential for efficient and sustainable long&#8208;term energy storage on a grid scale. To advance the development of nonaqueous RFBs with high energy densities, a new organic RFB system employing a molecularly engineered tetrathiafulvalene derivative ((PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF) as a high energy density catholyte was developed.&#160;When paired with a lithium metal anode, the two&#8208;electron&#8208;active (PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF catholyte produced a cell voltage of 3.56 V for the first reduction and 3.92 V for the second reduction process. In cyclic voltammetry and flow cell tests, the redox chemistry exhibited excellent cycling stability. The Li|(PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF batteries, with concentrations of 0.1 M and 0.5 M, demonstrated capacity retention rates of ~94% (99.87% per cycle, 97.52% per day) and 90% (99.93% per cycle, 99.16% per day), and the average Coulombic efficiencies of 99.38% and 98.35%, respectively. The flow cell achieved a high power density of 129 mW/cm2. Furthermore, owing to the high redox potential and solubility of (PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF, the flow cell attained a high operational energy density of 72 Wh/L (100 Wh/L theoretical). A 0.75 M flow cell exhibited an even higher operational energy density of 96 Wh/L (150 Wh/L theoretical).</dc:description>

         <title>Molecule Engineering of Sugar Derivatives as Electrolyte Additives for Deep&#8208;Reversible Zn Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cycling performance of zinc&#8208;ion batteries is greatly affected by dendrite formation and side reactions on zinc anode, particularly in scenarios involving high depth of discharge (DOD) and low negative/positive capacity (N/P) ratios in full cells. Herein, drawing upon principles of host&#8208;guest interaction chemistry, we investigate the impact of molecular structure of electrolyte additives, specifically the &#8208;COOH and &#8208;OH groups, on the zinc negative electrode through molecular design. Our findings reveal that molecules containing these groups exhibit strong adsorption onto zinc anode surfaces and chelate with Zn2+, forming a H2O&#8208;poor inner Helmholtz plane. This effectively suppresses side reactions and promotes dendrite&#8208;free zinc deposition of exposed (002) facets, enhancing stability and reversibility of an average coulombic efficiency of 99.89% with the introduction of Lactobionic acid (LA) additive. Under harsh conditions of 92% DOD, Zn//Zn cells exhibit stable cycling at challenging current densities of 15 mA&#183;cm&#8208;2. Even at a low N/P ratio of 1.3, Zn//NH4V4O10 full cells with LA electrolyte exhibit high&#8208;capacity retention of 73% after 300 cycles, significantly surpassing that of the blank electrolyte. Moreover, in a conversion type Zn//Br static battery with a high areal capacity (~ 5 mAh&#183;cm&#8208;2), LA electrolyte sustains an improved cycling stability of 700 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of &#8220;Structural Pin&#8221; Interactions and their Significance for the Conformational Control of Macrocyclic Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we identify structural pins as intramolecular hydrogen bonds in macrocycles that are predominantly responsible for conformational stabilization. Characterization and structural analysis of macrocycles with NMR and molecular modelling indicates that removal of a structural pin drastically influences the conformation of the entire ring, resulting in novel states with increased conformational heterogeneity.







Abstract
While peptide macrocycles with rigidified conformations have proven to be useful in the design of chemical probes of protein targets, conformational flexibility and rapid interconversion can be equally vital for biological activity and favorable physicochemical properties. This study introduces the concept of &#8220;structural pin&#8221;, which describes a hydrogen bond that is largely responsible for stabilizing the entire macrocycle backbone conformation. Structural analysis of macrocycles using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), molecular modelling and X&#8208;ray diffraction indicates that disruption of the structural pin can drastically influence the conformation of the entire ring, resulting in novel states with increased flexibility. This finding provides a new tool to interrogate dynamic behaviour of macrocycles. Identification of structural pins offers a useful conceptual framework to understand positions that can either be modified to give flexible structures or retained to maintain the rigidity of the scaffold.

         <title>Kinetics of Strand Displacement Reaction with Acyclic Artificial Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement (TMSD) reaction, one of the DNA nanotechnologies, has great potential as s biological programmable platform in the cellular environment. Various artificial nucleic acids have been developed to improve stability and affinity for biological applications. However, the lack of understanding of the kinetics of TMSD reaction among artificial nucleic acids has limited their applications. We herein systematically characterized the kinetics of TMSD reactions with acyclic xeno nucleic acids (XNAs): serinol nucleic acid (SNA), acyclic D&#8208;threoninol nucleic acid (D&#8208;aTNA), and acyclic L&#8208;threoninol nucleic acid (L&#8208;aTNA). We found that the strand displacement reactions by D&#8208;aTNA and by L&#8208;aTNA were highly dependent on temperature. D&#8208;aTNA and L&#8208;aTNA systems were orthogonal to each other, and chirality of the input can be switched by using SNA as an interface. We also applied TMSD reactions of XNAs to a seesaw gate amplification system which utilizes the orthogonality. This work will contribute to the developments of thermoresponsive and bioorthogonal nucleic acid circuits.</dc:description>

         <title>Anisotropic Dual S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunctions Mimic Natural Photosynthetic System for Boosting Photoelectric Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of heterojunctions that mimic natural photosynthetic systems holds great promise for enhancing photoelectric response. However, the limited interfacial space charge layer (SCL) often fails to provide sufficient driving force for the directional migration of inner charge carriers. Drawing inspiration from the electron transport chain (ETC) in natural photosynthesis system, we developed a novel anisotropic dual S&#8208;scheme heterojunction artificial photosynthetic system composed of Bi2O3&#8208;BiOBr&#8208;AgI for the first time, with Bi2O3 and AgI selectively distributed along the bicrystal facets of BiOBr. Compared to traditional semiconductors, the anisotropic carrier migration in BiOBr overcomes the recombination resulting from thermodynamic diffusion, thereby establishing a potential ETC for the directional migration of inner charge carriers. Importantly, this pioneering bioinspired design overcomes the limitations imposed by the limited distribution of SCL in heterojunctions, resulting in a remarkable 55&#8208;fold enhancement in photoelectric performance. Leveraging the etching of thiols on Ag&#8208;based materials, this dual S&#8208;scheme heterojunction is further employed in the construction of photoelectrochemical sensors for the detection of acetylcholinesterase and organophosphorus pesticides.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Selective CO2 Electroreduction to C2H4 Using a Dual&#8208;Sites Cu(II) Porphyrin Framework Coupled with Cu2O Nanoparticles via a Synergetic&#8208;Tandem Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low *CO coverage on the active sites is a major hurdle in the tandem electrocatalysis, resulting in unsatisfied C2H4 production efficiencies. In this work, we developed a synergetic&#8208;tandem strategy to construct a copper&#8208;based composite catalyst for the electroreduction of CO2 to C2H4, which was constructed via the template&#8208;directed polymerization of ultrathin Cu(II) porphyrin organic framework incorporating atomically isolated Cu(II) porphyrin and Cu(II) bipyridine sites on a carbon nanotube (CNT) scaffold, and then Cu2O nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed on the CNT scaffold. The presence of dual active sites within the Cu(II) porphyrin organic framework create a synergetic effect, leading to an increase in local *CO availability to enhance the C&#8211;C coupling step implemented on the adjacent Cu2O nanoparticles for further C2H4 production. Accordingly, the resultant catalyst affords an exceptional CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 Faradaic efficiency (FEC2H4) of 71.0% at &#8211;1.1 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), making it one of the most effective copper&#8208;based tandem catalysts reported to date. The superior performance of the catalyst is further confirmed through operando infrared spectroscopy and theoretic calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Fast&#8208;Healing Glassy Hyperbranched Plastics Capable of Restoring 26.4 MPa Tensile Strength within One Minute at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The growing concern regarding widespread plastic pollution has propelled the development of sustainable self&#8208;healing plastics. Although considerable efforts have been dedicated to fabricating self&#8208;healing plastics, achieving rapid healing at room temperature is extremely challenging. Herein, we have developed an ultra&#8208;fast&#8208;healing glassy polyurethane (UGPU) by designing a hyperbranched molecular structure with a high density of multiple hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds) on compliant acyclic heterochains and introducing trace water to form water bridge across the fractured surfaces. The compliant acyclic heterochains allow the dense multiple hydrogen bonds to form a frozen network, enabling tensile strength of up to 70 MPa and storage modulus of 2.5 GPa. The hyperbranched structure can drive the reorganization of the H&#8208;bonding network through the high mobility of the branched chains and terminals, thereby leading to self&#8208;healing ability at room temperature. Intriguingly, the presence of trace water vapor facilitates the formation of activated layers and the rearrangement of networks across the fractured UGPU sections, thereby enabling ultra&#8208;fast self&#8208;healing at room temperature. Consequently, the restored tensile strength after healing for 1 minute achieves a historic&#8208;record of 26.4 MPa. Furthermore, the high transparency (&gt;90%) and ultra&#8208;fast healing property of UGPU make it an excellent candidate for advanced optical and structural materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Pore Engineering of Zirconium Metal&#8208;Organic Cages for One&#8208;Step Ethylene Purification from Ternary Mixtures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One&#8208;step purification of ethylene from ternary mixtures (C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6) can greatly reduce the energy consumption of the separation process, but it is extremely challenging. Herein, we use crystal engineering and reticular chemistry to introduce unsaturated bonds (ethynyl and alkyne) into ligands, and successfully design and synthesized two novel Zr&#8208;MOCs (ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;ethenyl and ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;alkyne). The introduction of carbon&#8208;carbon unsaturated bonds provides abundant adsorption sites within the framework while modulating the pore window size. Comprehensive characterization techniques including single crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, as well as electrospray ionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS) confirm that ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;ethenyl and ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;alkyne possess an isostructural framework with ZrT&#8208;1 and ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;Me, respectively. Adsorption isotherms and breakthrough experiments combined with theoretical calculations demonstrate that ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;ethenyl can effectively remove trace C2H2 and C2H6 in C2H4 and achieve separation of C2H2 from C2H4 and CO2. ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;ethenyl can also directly purify C2H4 in liquid solutions. This work provides a benchmark for MOCs that one&#8208;step purification of ethylene from ternary mixtures.</dc:description>

         <title>Shape Shifting and Locking in Mechanically Responsive Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Materials for Thermoelastic Actuators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of mechanically responsive materials with reversible shape&#8208;shifting, shape&#8208;locking, and stretchability holds promise for a wide range of applications in fields such as soft robotics and flexible electronics. Here, we report novel thermoelastic one&#8208;dimensional organic&#8208;inorganic hybrids (R/S&#8208;Hmpy)PbI3 (Hmpy = 2&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;pyrrolidinium) to show mechanical responses. The single crystals undergo two phase transitions at 310 K and 380 K. When heated to 380 K, they show shape&#8208;shifting and expansion along the b&#8208;axis by about 13.4%, corresponding to a larger deformation than that of thermally activated shape memory alloys (8.5%), and exhibit a strong actuation force. During cooling process, the stretched crystal shape maintains and a shape&#8208;locking phenomenon occurs, which is lifted when the temperature decreasing to 305 K. Meanwhile, due to the introduction of chiral ions, the thermal switching shows a 10&#8208;fold second&#8208;order nonlinear switching contrast (common values typically below 3&#8208;fold). This study presents a thermoelastic actuator based on shape&#8208;shifting and &#8208;locking of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrids for the first time. The dielectric and nonlinear optical switching properties of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrids broaden the range of applications of mechanically responsive crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Introducing a &#960;&#8208;Skeleton Perpendicular to the Central Methylene Carbon in Alkanediamides: Design of Supramolecular Polymers with an Offset &#960;&#8208;Stacking Arrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The self&#8208;assembly behavior of a heptanediamide derivative that contains a four&#8208;ring fused &#960;&#8208;skeleton on its central methylene carbon atom has been examined. This molecule, which also contains two octyl chains, gelated the nonpolar solvent methylcyclohexane through the formation of fibrous nanostructures with hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks through a cooperative nucleation&#8211;elongation process. The supramolecular polymerization is accompanied by bathochromic shifts of both the absorption and fluorescence bands while maintaining a fluorescence quantum yield comparable to that of the monomeric state. Theoretical calculations provided an energetically stable structure, in which the &#960;&#8208;skeletons are stacked with an offset of more than 8.0 &#197;, replicating the experimentally observed absorption change due to exciton coupling. Moreover, a slow transition with an inversion of the chiral arrangement of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated moieties was induced by replacing the octyl chains with chiral alkyl chains. Our molecular&#8208;design strategy was further applied to a five&#8208;ring fused &#960;&#8208;skeleton, which also forms an offset &#960;&#8208;stacking arrangement and exhibits more effective chiral exciton coupling in the aggregated state.</dc:description>

         <title>Elevating Discharge Voltage of Li&#8322;CO&#8323;&#8208;routine Li&#8208;CO&#8322;&#160;Battery over 2.9 V at an Ultra&#8208;wide Temperature Window</title>

         <dc:description>The Li&#8208;CO&#8322; batteries utilizing greenhouse gas CO&#8322; possess advantages of high energy density and environmental friendliness. However, these batteries following Li&#8322;CO&#8323;&#8208;product route typically exhibit low work voltage (&lt;2.5 V) and energy efficiency. Herein, we have demonstrated for the first time that cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) as homogeneous catalyst can elevate the work plateau towards 2.98 V, which is higher than its theoretical discharge voltage without changing the Li&#8322;CO&#8323;&#8208;product route. This unprecedented discharge voltage is illustrated by mass spectrum and electrochemical analyses that CoPc has powerful adsorption capability with CO&#8322;&#160;(&#8208;7.484 kJ/mol) and forms discharge intermediate of C&#8323;&#8323;H&#8321;&#8326;CoN&#8328;O&#8322;. Besides high discharge capacity of 18724 mAh/g and robust cyclability over 1600 hours (1000 mAh/g&#160;cut&#8208;off) at a current density of 100 mA/g&#160;, the batteries show high temperature adaptability (&#8208;30~80 &#8304;C). Our work is paving a promising avenue for the progress of high&#8208;efficiency Li&#8208;CO&#8322; batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Induced Supramolecular Peptide Assemblies for Multi&#8208;pathway Cell Death and Tumor Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although self&#8208;assembly has emerged as an effective tool for fabricating biomaterials, achieving precise control over the morphologies and functionalities of the resultant assemblies remains an ongoing challenge. Inspired by the copper peptide naturally present in human plasma, in this study, we designed a synthetic precursor, FcGH. FcGH can self&#8208;assemble via two distinct pathways: spontaneous and Cu2+&#8208;induced. These two assembly pathways enabled the formation of assemblies with tunable morphologies by adjusting the amount of added Cu2+. We found that the nanoparticles formed by Cu2+&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly exhibited a significantly higher cellular uptake efficiency than the wormlike fibers formed spontaneously. Moreover, this Cu2+&#8208;induced assembly process occurred spontaneously at a 1:1 molar ratio of Cu2+ to FcGH, avoiding the excessive use of Cu&#178;&#8314; and a tedious preparation procedure. By co&#8208;assembling with FcGH&#8208;conjugated 10&#8208;hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT), Cu2+&#8208;induced supramolecular nanodrugs elicited multiple cell death modalities in cancer cells with elevated immunogenicity, enhancing the therapeutic effect compared to free HCPT. This study highlights Cu2+&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly as an efficient tool for directing the assembly of nanodrugs and for synergistic tumor therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacially Ordered NiCoMoS Nanosheets Arrays on Hierarchical Ti3C2Tx MXene for High&#8208;energy&#8208;density Fiber&#8208;Shaped Supercapacitors with Accelerated Pseudocapacitive Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Balancing electrochemical activity and structural reversibility of fibrous electrodes with accelerated Faradaic charge transfer kinetics and pseudocapacitive storage are highly crucial for fiber&#8208;shaped supercapacitors (FSCs). Herein, we report novel core&#8208;shell hierarchical fibers for high&#8208;performance FSCs, in which the ordered NiCoMoS nanosheets arrays are chemically anchored on Ti3C2Tx fiber. Beneficial from architecting stable polymetallic sulfide arrays and conductive networks, the NiCoMoS&#8208;Ti3C2Tx fiber maintains fast charge transfer, low diffusion and OH&#8208; adsorption barrier, and stabilized multi&#8208;electronic reaction kinetics of polymetallic sulfide. Consequently, the NiCoMoS&#8208;Ti3C2Tx fiber exhibits a large volumetric capacitance (2472.3 F cm&#8208;3) and reversible cycling performance (20,000 cycles). In addition, the solid&#8208;state symmetric FSCs deliver a high energy density of 50.6 mWh cm&#8208;3 and bending stability, which can significantly power electronic devices and offer sensitive detection for dopamine.</dc:description>

         <title>The effective separation of photogenerated carriers in MIL101 nanocomposites promoting the efficient photocatalytic desulfurization in air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The extensive industrial applications of fuel oil, a critical strategic resource, are accompanied by significant environmental and health concerns due to the presence of sulfur&#8208;containing compounds in its composition, which result in hazardous combustion waste. Extensive research has been conducted to develop technologies for low&#8208;vulcanization fuel production to address this issue. Consequently, the investigation of catalysts for environmentally friendly and safe photocatalytic desulfurization becomes imperative. To that end, we have designed efficient MIL&#8208;101(Fe)/CQDs@g&#8208;C3N4 (MIL101/CDs&#8208;C3N4) Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalysts with high carrier separation and mobility through a thermal polymerization&#8208;hydrothermal strategy. The high concentration of photogenerated carriers facilitates the activation of oxygen and H2O2, leading to increased production of ROS (&#183;O2&#8208;, &#183;OH, h+), thereby enhancing the photocatalytic desulfurization (PODS). Additionally, DFT calculations were utilized to determine the electron migration pathways of the catalysts and adsorption energies of DBT (dibenzothiophene). Moreover, Gibbs free energy calculations indicated that MIL101/CDs&#8208;C3N4 exhibited the lowest activation energy for oxygen and H2O2. The mechanism of photocatalytic desulfurization was proposed through a combination of theoretical calculations and experimental studies. This study provides guidance for the development of MOF&#8208;based Z&#8208;scheme systems and their practical application in desulfurization processes.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structure of molecular aggregates is crucial for charge transport and photovoltaic performance in organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, the intermolecular interactions and aggregated structures of nonfused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (NFREAs) are precisely regulated through a halogen transposition strategy, resulting in a noteworthy transformation from a 2D&#8208;layered structure to a 3D&#8208;interconnected packing network. Based on the 3D electron transport pathway, the binary and ternary devices deliver outstanding power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 17.46% and 18.24%, respectively, marking the highest value for NFREA&#8208;based OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Bis&#8208;azopyrazole Photoswitches for Efficient Solar Light Harvesting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although natural sunlight is one of the most abundant and sustainable energy resources, only a fraction of its energy is currently harnessed and utilized in photoactive systems. The development of molecular photoswitches that can be directly activated by sunlight is imperative for unlocking the full potential of solar energy and addressing the growing energy demands. Herein,&#160;we designed a series of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;azopyrazoles that features a coupled &#960;n system, resulting in a pronounced redshift in its spectral absorption, reaching up to 661 nm in the red region. By varying the amino substituents of these molecules, highly efficient E&#8594;Z photoisomerization under unfiltered sunlight can be achieved, with yields of up to 88.4%. Moreover, the Z,Z&#8208;isomers have high thermal stability with half&#8208;lives from days to years at room temperature. The introduction of ortho&#8208;amino substitutions and meta&#8208;bisazo units leads to a reversal of the n&#8211;&#960;* and &#960;n&#8211;&#960;* transitions on the energy scale. This change provides a new perspective for further tuning the visible absorption of azo&#8208;switches by utilizing the &#960;n&#8211;&#960;* band instead of the conventional n&#8211;&#960;* band. These results suggest that photoresponsive systems can be powered by sunlight instead of traditional artificial lights, thereby paving the way for sustainable smart materials and devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Steering Geometric Reconstruction of Bismuth with Accelerated Dynamics for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bismuth&#8208;based materials have emerged as promising catalysts in the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to formate. However, the reasons for the reconstruction of Bi&#8208;based precursors to form bismuth nanosheets are still puzzling, especially the formation of defective bismuth sites. Herein, we prepare bismuth nanosheets with vacancy&#8208;rich defects (V&#8208;Bi NS) by rapidly reconstructing Bi19Cl3S27 under negative potential. Theoretical analysis reveals that the introduction of chlorine induces the generation of intrinsic electric field in the precursor, thereby increasing the electron transfer rate and further promoting the metallization of trivalent bismuth. Meanwhile, in situ Raman and ex situ XRD tests verify that Bi19Cl3S27 has a faster reconstruction rate than Bi2S3. The formed V&#8208;Bi NS exhibits up to 96% HCOO&#8208; Faraday efficiency and 400 mA cm&#8208;2 HCOO&#8208; partial current densities, and its ECSA normalized formate current density and yield are 2.2 times higher than those of intact bismuth nanosheets (I&#8208;Bi NS). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that bismuth vacancies with electron&#8208;rich aggregation reduce the activation energy of CO2 to *CO2&#8208; radicals and stabilize the adsorption of the key intermediate *OCHO, thus facilitating the reaction kinetics of formate production.</dc:description>

         <title>Chromium Catalyzed Asymmetric Reformatsky Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study describes an unprecedented chromium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Reformatsky reaction, enabling the synthesis of chiral &#946;&#8208;hydroxy carbonyl compounds from &#945;&#8208;chlorinated or &#945;&#8208;brominated esters and amides. By employing a chiral chromium/diarylamine bis(oxazoline) catalyst, we achieved relatively broad functional group tolerance. Distinct from known reports, the protocol operates under both classical and photoredox conditions, facilitated by the in&#8208;situ formation of a nucleophilic chiral chromium intermediate through a radical&#8208;polar crossover mechanism. Preliminary mechanistic insights, supported by DFT calculations, identify the nucleophilic aldehyde addition as the key stereo&#8208;determining step. This approach not only overcomes the limitations of existing Reformatsky reactions but also provides a versatile strategy for accessing complex chiral molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Skeletal and Mechanistic Diversity&#160; in Ir&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloisomerizations of Allene&#8208;Tethered Pyrroles and Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyrroles and indoles bearing N&#8208;allenyl tethers participate in a variety of iridium&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization processes initiated by a C&#8208;H activation step, to deliver a diversity of synthetically relevant azaheterocyclic products. By appropriate selection of the ancillary ligand and the substitution pattern of the allene, the reactions can diverge from simple intramolecular hydrocarbonations to tandem processes involving intriguing mechanistic issues. Accordingly, a wide range of heterocyclic structures ranging from dihydro&#8208;indolizines and pyridoindoles to tetrahydroindolizines, as well as cyclopropane&#8208;fused tetrahydroindolizines can be obtained. Moreover, by using chiral ligands, these cascade processes can be carried out in an enantioselective manner. DFT studies provide insights into the underlying mechanisms and justify the observed chemo&#8208; regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Coupling of Aryl Chlorides with Lithium Nucleophiles Enabled by Molecularly Defined Alkynyllithium Palladium Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings of aryl chlorides usually call for bulky, electron&#8208;rich ligands such as phosphines or heterocyclic carbenes. We have now found that similarly powerful cross&#8208;coupling catalysts are obtained by the reaction of palladium salts with alkynyllithium reagents. The species initially formed in this process was characterized as a dilithium tetraalkinyl palladate complex. It catalyzes the coupling of aryl chlorides with the lithium salts of various terminal alkynes to give alkynyl arenes. The isolated Li&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;Pd complex also efficiently promotes the reaction of aryl, and allyl chlorides with (hetero)aryl&#8208;, alkyl&#8208;, and allyllithium compounds as well as lithium amines. None of these reactions proceeded in the presence of palladium salts alone. The preparative utility of this approach was demonstrated by the synthesis of 49 molecules, including pharmaceutically relevant compounds.</dc:description>

The preparative utility of this approach was demonstrated by the synthesis of 49 molecules, including pharmaceutically relevant compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inducing and Switching the Handedness of Polyacetylenes with Topologically Chiral [2]Catenane Pendants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To explore the chirality induction and switching of topological chirality, poly[2]catenanes composed of helical poly(phenylacetylenes) (PPAs) main chain and topologically chiral [2]catenane pendants are described for the first time. These poly[2]catenanes with optically active [2]catenanes on side chains were synthesized by polymerization of enantiomerically pure topologically chiral [2]catenanes with ethynyl polymerization site and/or point chiral moiety. The chirality information of [2]catenane pendants was successfully transferred to the main chain of polyene backbones, leading to preferred&#8208;handed helical conformations, while the introduction of point chiral units has negligible effect on the overall helices. More interestingly, attributed to unique dynamic feature of the [2]catenane pendants, these polymers revealed dynamic response behaviors to solvents, temperature, and sodium ions, resulting in the fully reversible switching on/off of the chirality induction. This work provides not only new design strategy for novel chiroptical switches with topologically chiral molecules but also novel platforms for the development of smart chiral materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Flexible aqueous Cr&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitors with remarkable electrochemical properties in all climates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The integration of hostless battery&#8208;like metal anodes for hybrid supercapacitors is a realistic design method for energy storage devices with promising future applications. With significant Cr element deposits on Earth, exceptionally high theoretical capacity (1546 mAh g&#8208;1), and accessible redox potential (&#8208;0.74 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) of Cr metals, the design of Cr anodes has rightly come into our focus. This work presents a breakthrough design of a flexible Cr&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitor (CHSC) based on a porous graphitized carbon fabric (PGCF) substrate prepared by K2FeO4 activation. In the CHSC device, PGCF acts as both a current collector and cathode material due to its high specific surface area and superior conductivity. The use of a highly concentrated LiCl&#8208;CrCl3 electrolyte with high Cr plating/stripping efficiency and excellent antifreeze properties enables the entire PGCF&#8208;based CHSC to achieve well&#8208;balanced performance in terms of energy density (up to 1.47 mWh cm&#8208;2), power characteristics (reaching 9.95 mW cm&#8208;2) and durability (95.4% capacity retention after 30,000 cycles), while realizing it to work well under harsh conditions of &#8208;40 &#176;C. This work introduces a new concept for low&#8208;temperature energy storage technology and confirms the potential application of Cr anodes in hybrid supercapacitors.</dc:description>

With significant Cr element deposits on Earth, exceptionally high theoretical capacity (1546 mAh g-1), and accessible redox potential (-0.74 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) of Cr metals, the design of Cr anodes has rightly come into our focus.

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure Molecular Sieving of High&#8208;Humidity C2H4/C2H6 Mixture by a Hydrophobic Flexible Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular sieving is an ideal separation mechanism, but controlling pore size, restricting framework flexibility, and avoiding strong adsorption are all very challenging. Here, we report a flexible adsorbent showing molecular sieving at ambient temperature and high pressure, even under high humidity. While typical guest&#8208;induced transformations are observed, a high transition pressure of 16.6 atm is observed for C2H4 at 298 K because of very weak C2H4 adsorption (~16 kJ mol&#8211;1). Also, C2H6 is completely excluded below the pore&#8208;opening pressure of 7.7 atm, giving single&#8208;component selectivity of ca. 300. Quantitative high&#8208;pressure column breakthrough experiments using 1:1 C2H4/C2H6 mixture at 10 atm as input confirms molecular sieving with C2H4 adsorption of 0.73 mmol g&#8211;1 or 32 cm3(STP) cm&#8211;3 and negligible C2H6 adsorption of 0.001(2) mmol g&#8211;1, and the adsorbent can be completely regenerated by inert gas purging. Furthermore, it is highly hydrophobic with negligible water adsorption, and the C2H4/C2H6 separation performance is unaffected at high humidity.</dc:description>

         <title>A Radical Activation Strategy for Versatile and Stereoselective N&#8208;Glycosylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Previous N&#8208;glycosylation approaches have predominately involved acidic conditions, facing challenges of low stereoselectivity and limited scope. Herein, we introduce a radical activation strategy that enables versatile and stereoselective N&#8208;glycosylation using readily accessible glycosyl sulfinate as a donor under basic conditions and exhibits exceptional tolerance towards various N&#8208;aglycones containing alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl and nucleobase functionalities. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate a pivotal role of iodide, which orchestrates the formation of a glycosyl radical from the glycosyl sulfinate and subsequent generation of the key intermediate, a configurationally well&#8208;defined glycosyl iodide, which is subsequently attacked by an N&#8208;aglycone in a stereospecific SN2 manner to give the desired N&#8208;glycosides. An alternative route involving the coupling of a glycosyl radical and a nitrogen&#8208;centered radical is also proposed, affording the exclusive 1,2&#8208;trans product. This novel approach promises to broaden the synthetic landscape of N&#8208;glycosides, offering a powerful tool for the construction of complex glycosidic structures under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>De Novo Discovery of Pseudo&#8208;Natural Prenylated Macrocyclic Peptide Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prenylation of peptides is widely observed in the secondary metabolites of diverse organisms, granting peptides unique chemical properties distinct from proteinogenic amino acids. Discovery of prenylated peptide agents has largely relied on isolation or genome mining of naturally occurring molecules. To devise a platform technology for de novo discovery of artificial prenylated peptides targeting a protein of choice, here we have integrated the thioether&#8208;macrocyclic peptide (teMP) library construction/selection technology, so&#8208;called RaPID (Random nonstandard Peptides Integrated Discovery) system, with a Trp&#8208;C3&#8208;prenyltransferase KgpF involved in the biosynthesis of a prenylated natural product. This unique enzyme exhibited remarkably broad substrate tolerance, capable of modifying various Trp&#8208;containing teMPs to install a prenylated residue with tricyclic constrained structure. We constructed a vast library of prenylated teMPs and subjected it to in vitro selection against a phosphoglycerate mutase. This selection platform has led to the identification of a pseudo&#8208;natural prenylated teMP inhibiting the target enzyme with an IC50 of 30 nM. Importantly, the prenylation was essential for the inhibitory activity, enhanced serum stability, and cellular uptake of the peptide, highlighting the benefits of peptide prenylation. This work showcases the de novo discovery platform for pseudo&#8208;natural prenylated peptides, which is readily applicable to other drug targets.</dc:description>

         <title>Ir(triNHC)&#8208;Catalyzed Upcycling of Waste PET for Lactic Acid Production with Sustainable Isolation via Bipolar Membrane Electrodialysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For the upcycling of waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET), encompassing both colored and fabric PET materials, we investigated the Ir(triNHC)&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative coupling of PET and methanol, leading to the production of sodium lactate with good yields. We proposed a sustainable method for isolating lactic acid from the catalytic reaction mixture of sodium lactate and regenerating the base using bipolar membrane electrodialysis (BMED). This isolation method demonstrated high effectiveness, achieving isolation of lactic acid while maintaining economic feasibility at $0.10 per kg of lactic acid, and enabling sustainable NaOH regeneration with complete resource circulation. We assessed the recyclability of the catalyst and elucidated the mechanism involving base&#8208;mediated depolymerization and catalyst&#8208;promoted dehydrogenation, highlighting the importance of triNHC ligands in enhancing catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery, Total Synthesis, and Anti&#8208;inflammatory Evaluation of Naturally Occurring Naphthopyrone&#8208;Macrolide Hybrids as Potent NLRP3 Inflammasome Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Numerous clinical disorders have been linked to the etiology of dysregulated NLRP3 (NACHT, LRR, and PYD domain&#8208;containing protein 3) inflammasome activation. Despite its potential as a pharmacological target, modulation of NLRP3 activity remains challenging. Only a sparse number of compounds have been reported that can modulate NLRP3 and none of them have been developed into a commercially available drug. In this research, we identified three potent NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors, gymnoasins A&#8722;C (1&#8722;3), with unprecedented pentacyclic scaffolds, from an Antarctic fungus Pseudogymnoascus sp. HDN17&#8208;895, which represent the first naturally occurring naphthopyrone&#8208;macrolide hybrids. Additionally, biomimetic synthesis of gymnoasin A (1) was also achieved validating the chemical structure and affording ample amounts of material for exhaustive bioactivity assessments. Biological assays indicated that 1 could significantly inhibited in vitro NLRP3 inflammasome activation and in vivo pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine IL&#8208;1&#946; release, representing a valuable new lead compound for the development of novel therapeutics with the potential to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome.</dc:description>

         <title>Dearomative Intramolecular meta&#8208;Thermocycloadditions of Benzene Rings via Wheland Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dearomative cycloadditions are powerful synthetic transformations utilizing aromatic compounds for cycloaddition reactions. They have been extensively applied to the synthesis of biologically relevant compounds not only because of the complexity generated from simplicity but also the atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economy. For the most studied yet challenging benzene ring systems, ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;cycloadditions have been realized both photochemically and thermally, while the meta&#8208;cycloadditions are still limited to the photochemical processes tracing back to the 1960s. Herein, we for the first time realized the thermal cycloadditions of benzene rings with alkenes in a meta fashion via Wheland intermediates. A broad spectrum of readily available C(sp2)&#8208;rich aniline&#8208;tethered enynes were transformed into C(sp3)&#8208;rich 3D complex polycyclic architectures simply by stirring in TFA. Moreover, the reaction could be performed in gram&#8208;scales and the products could be diversely elaborated.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Release of Diborane from Alkali Metal Borohydride using Ionic Liquid&#8208;Based Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkali metal borohydrides present a rich source of energy dense materials of boron and hydrogen, however their potential in propellants has been hitherto untapped. Potassium borohydride is a promising fuel with high gravimetric energy density and relatively low sensitivity to air and moisture. Problems arise due to the dehydrogenation of the borohydride on heating with minimal energy release. Common methods to extract both boron and hydrogen by means of borane species involve direct reaction of boron trifluoride species with alkali borohydrides. However, these methods face storage and safety issues due to rapid release of diborane on mixing the reactants. We propose a method of diborane release through controlled release of boron trifluoride by means of a tetrafluoroborate based ionic liquid. The trifluoride is released from the ionic liquid at elevated temperatures and enables safe mixture of the reactants at room temperature. It was found that the reaction between borohydride and boron trifluoride proceeds well above room temperature with potassium borohydride releasing diborane and potassium fluoride. The reaction pathway shows a primary reaction releasing diborane and potassium fluoride and a second less energy efficient step leading to the formation of potassium tetrafluoroborate. A 3d printed propellant formulation was also tested.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient C(sp3)&#8208;H bond oxidation on perovskite quantum dots based on Ce&#8208;oxygen affinity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have shown attractive prospects in the field of visible photocatalysis, especially in the synthesis of high value&#8208;added chemicals. However, under aerobic conditions, the stable operation of QD catalysts has been limited by the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by photoexcitation, especially superoxide species. Here, we propose a strategy of Ce3+ doping in perovskite QDs to guide superoxide species for photocatalytic oxidation reactions. In C(sp3)&#8208;H bond oxidation of hydrocarbons, superoxide species were rapidly generated and efficiently utilized on the surface of perovskite QDs, which achieves the stable operation of the catalytic system and obtains a high product conversion rate (15.3 mmol/g/h for benzaldehydes). The mechanism studies show that the strong Ce&#8208;oxygen affinity accelerates the relaxation process of photoinduced exciton transfer to superoxide species and inhibits the radiative recombination pathway. This work provides a new idea of utilizing oxygen species on perovskite surface and broadens the design strategy of high&#8208;performance QD photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating the Solvation Structure in Polymer Electrolytes for High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid polymer electrolytes are promising electrolytes for safe and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries. However, traditional ether&#8208;based polymer electrolytes are limited by their low lithium&#8208;ion conductivity and narrow electrochemical window because of the well&#8208;defined and intimated Li+&#8208;oxygen binding topologies in the solvation structure. Herein, we proposed a new strategy to reduce the Li+&#8208;polymer interaction and strengthen the anion&#8208;polymer interaction by combining strong Li+&#8208;O (ether) interactions, weak Li+&#8208;O (ester) interactions with steric hindrance in polymer electrolytes. In this way, a polymer electrolyte with a high lithium ion transference number (0.80) and anion&#8208;rich solvation structure is obtained. This polymer electrolyte possesses a wide electrochemical window (5.5 V versus Li/Li+) and compatibility with both Li metal anode and high&#8208;voltage NCM cathode. Li||LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 full cells with middle&#8208;high active material areal loading (~7.5 mg cm&#8208;2) can stably cycle at 4.5 V. This work provides new insight into the design of polymer electrolytes for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries through the regulation of ion&#8208;dipole interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Polycatenanes Formed of Self&#8208;Assembled Metal Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly&#8208;[n]&#8208;catenanes (PCs) self&#8208;assembled of 3D metal organic cages (MOCs) (hereafter PCs&#8208;MOCs) are a relatively new class of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) combining the properties of MOCs and polymers. The synthesis of PCs&#8208;MOCs is challenging because of the difficulties of interlocking MOCs, the arising of multiple weak supramolecular electrostatic interactions between cages, and the importance of solvent templating effects. The high density of mechanical bonds interlocking the MOCs endows mechanical and physical properties such as enhanced stability, responsive dynamic behavior and low solubility, which can unlock new functional properties. In this Minireview, we highlight the benefit of interlocking MOCs in the formation of PCs&#8208;MOCs as well as the synthetic approaches exploited in their preparation, from thermodynamic to kinetic ways. Examples disclosed&#160;are PCs&#8208;MOCs self&#8208;assembled of various types of MOCs, giving an overview on the research so far carried out in this area. The focus is on the structure&#8208;property relationship with examples of functional applications such as electron conductivity, X&#8208;ray attenuation, gas adsorption and molecular sensing. We believe that the structural and functional aspects of the reviewed PCs&#8208;MOCs will attract chemists and material scientists working a wide range of nanotechnological disciplines.</dc:description>

         <title>Closed&#8208;loop recycling of mixed plastics of polyester and CO2&#8208;based polycarbonate to a single monomer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Physical blending is an effective strategy for tailoring polymeric materials to specific application requirements. However, physically blended mixed plastics waste adds additional barriers in mechanical or chemical recycling. This difficulty arises from the intricate requirement for meticulous sorting and separation of the various polymers in the inherent incompatibility of mixed polymers during recycling. To overcome this impediment, this work furthers the emerging single&#8208;monomer &#8211; multiple&#8208;materials approach through the design of a bifunctional monomer that can not only orthogonally polymerize into two different types of polymers &#8211; specifically lactone&#8208;based polyester and CO2&#8208;based polycarbonate &#8211; but the resultant polymers and their mixture can also be depolymerized back to the single, original monomer when facilitated by catalysis. Specifically, the lactone/epoxide hybrid bifunctional monomer (BiLO) undergoes ring&#8208;opening polymerization through the lactone manifold to produce polyester, PE(BiLO), and is also applied to ring&#8208;opening copolymerization with CO2, via the epoxide manifold, to yield polycarbonate, PC(BiLO). Remarkably, a one&#8208;pot recycling process of a BiLO&#8208;derived PE/PC blend back to the constituent monomer BiLO in &gt;99% selectivity was achieved with a superbase catalyst at 150 &#176;C, thereby effectively obviating the requirement for sorting and separation typically required for recycling of mixed polymers.</dc:description>

To overcome this impediment, this work furthers the emerging single-monomer &#8211; multiple-materials approach through the design of a bifunctional monomer that can not only orthogonally polymerize into two different types of polymers &#8211; specifically lactone-based polyester and CO2-based polycarbonate &#8211; but the resultant polymers and their mixture can also be depolymerized back to the single, original monomer when facilitated by catalysis. Specifically, the lactone/epoxide hybrid bifunctional monomer (BiLO) undergoes ring-opening polymerization through the lactone manifold to produce polyester, PE(BiLO), and is also applied to ring-opening copolymerization with CO2, via the epoxide manifold, to yield polycarbonate, PC(BiLO). Remarkably, a one-pot recycling process of a BiLO-derived PE/PC blend back to the constituent monomer BiLO in &amp;gt;99% selectivity was achieved with a superbase catalyst at 150 &#176;C, thereby effectively obviating the requirement for sorting and separation typically required for recycling of mixed polymers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polycationic Open&#8208;Shell Cyclophanes: Synthesis of Electron&#8208;Rich Chiral Macrocycles, and Redox&#8208;Dependent Electronic States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;conjugated new chiral macrocycles 1 and 2 have been accessed using the redox&#8208;active main&#8208;group carbazole and &#960;&#8208;expanded aza[7]helicene moieties. Chemical and electrochemical oxidations of these electron&#8208;rich Figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight macrocycles readily enabled the conversion to chiral polycationic open&#8208;shell cyclophanes with tunable electronic states that are rarely accessible from the all&#8208;carbon&#8208;based analogues.







Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Conjugated chiral nanorings with intriguing electronic structures and chiroptical properties have attracted considerable interests in synthetic chemistry and materials science. We present the design principles to access new chiral macrocycles (1 and 2) that are essentially built on the key components of main&#8208;group electron&#8208;donating carbazolyl moieties or the &#960;&#8208;expanded aza[7]helicenes. Both macrocycles show the unique molecular conformations with a (quasi) figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight topology as a result of the conjugation patterns of 2,2&#8217;,7,7&#8217;&#8208;spirobifluorenyl in 1 and triarylamine&#8208;coupled aza[7]helicene&#8208;based building blocks in 2. This electronic nature of redox&#8208;active, carbazole&#8208;rich backbones enabled these macrocycles to be readily oxidized chemically and electrochemically, leading to the sequential production of a series of positively charged polycationic open&#8208;shell cyclophanes. Their redox&#8208;dependent electronic states of the resulting multispin polyradicals have been characterized by VT&#8208;ESR, UV/Vis&#8208;NIR absorption and spectroelectrochemical measurements. The singlet (&#916;ES&#8208;T=&#8722;1.29&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and a nearly degenerate singlet&#8208;triplet ground state (&#916;ES&#8722;T(calcd)=&#8722;0.15&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and &#916;ES&#8722;T(exp)=0.01&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) were proved for diradical dications 12+2&#8901; and 22+2&#8901;, respectively. Our work provides an experimental proof for the construction of electron&#8208;donating new chiral nanorings, and more importantly for highly charged polyradicals with potential applications in chirospintronics and organic conductors.

         <title>Domain Swapping in Abiotic Foldamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abiotic foldamers have been shown to reproduce some of the patterns of protein folding in organic solvents, including cooperative folding transition and the accommodation of conformational strain within tertiary folds. Here, we show that a foldamer initially designed to form a quaternary structure in fact leads to a domain&#8208;swapped dimer, another pattern well&#8208;known in proteins.







Abstract
Foldamer sequences that adopt tertiary helix&#8208;turn&#8208;helix folds mediated by helix&#8208;helix hydrogen bonding in organic solvents have been previously reported. In an attempt to create genuine abiotic quaternary structures, i.e. assemblies of tertiary structures, new sequences were prepared that possess additional hydrogen bond donors at positions that may promote an association between the tertiary folds. However, a solid state structure and extensive solution state investigations by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Circular Dichroism (CD) show that, instead of forming a quaternary structure, the tertiary folds assemble into stable domain&#8208;swapped dimer motifs. Domain swapping entails a complete reorganization of the arrays of hydrogen bonds and changes in relative helix orientation and handedness that can all be rationalized.

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Atom Transfer Enabled Catalytic Enantioselective Coupling to Chiral Trifluoromethylated Alkynes via Dual Nickel and Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With halogen&#8208;atom transfer as an effective tool, a novel catalytic enantioselective protocol generating chiral trifluoromethylated alkynes with high yields and selectivities has been established. It uses a cooperative photoredox and nickel catalysis system, and expands the nickel&#8208;catalysed asymmetric reductive cross&#8208;coupling of organohalides from the traditional single&#8208;electron transfer to halogen&#8208;atom transfer.







Abstract
With halogen&#8208;atom transfer as an effective tool, a novel catalytic enantioselective protocol to generate chiral trifluoromethylated alkynes has been established by a cooperative photoredox and nickel catalysis system, providing a straightforward and modular route to access this type of product in good yields and enantioselectivities. The halogen&#8208;atom transfer process is essential for the reaction and this novel strategy offers another promising way to utilize alkyl halides with highly negative reduction potentials. It firstly expands nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reductive cross&#8208;couplings of organohalides from the traditional single&#8208;electron transfer to halogen&#8208;atom transfer.

         <title>Including the Ensemble of Unstructured Conformations in the Analysis of Protein's Native State by High&#8208;Pressure NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The separation between general and structural related effects of hydrostatic pressure on protein chemical shifts is an issue which has so far been assessed by the impact hydrostatic pressure has on random coil peptides. Here, a new approach based on the response of the corresponding unfolded polypeptide chain under study to increasing hydrostatic pressure has been developed and is compared with existing approaches.







Abstract
The analysis of pressure induced changes in the chemical shift of proteins allows statements on structural fluctuations proteins exhibit at ambient pressure. The inherent issue of separating general pressure effects from structural related effects on the pressure dependence of chemical shifts has so far been addressed by considering the characteristics of random coil peptides on increasing pressure. In this work, chemically and pressure denatured states of the cold shock protein B from Bacillus subtilis (BsCspB) have been assigned in 2D 1H&#8208;15N HSQC NMR spectra and their dependence on increasing hydrostatic pressure has been evaluated. The pressure denatured polypeptide chain has been used to separate general from structural related effects on 1H and 15N chemical shifts of native BsCspB and the implications on the interpretation of pressure induced changes in the chemical shift regarding the structure of BsCspB are discussed. It has been found that the ensemble of unstructured conformations of BsCspB shows different responses to increasing pressure than random coil peptides do. Thus, the approach used for considering the general effects that arise when hydrostatic pressure increases changes the structural conclusions that are drawn from high pressure NMR spectroscopic experiments that rely on the analysis of chemical shifts.

         <title>Microwave Assisted Fast Synthesis of a Donor&#8208;Acceptor COF Towards Photooxidative Amidation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a microwave&#8208;assisted rapid synthesis (in time scale, t=10&#8197;seconds to 10&#8197;minutes) of a D&#8722;A based covalent organic framework, TzPm&#8208;COF towards photooxidative amidation reaction from aldehyde and amine. This photocatalytic approach works well with a variety of substituted aromatic aldehydes having electron&#8208;withdrawing or donating groups and cyclic, acyclic, primary or secondary amines with moderate to high yield.







Abstract
The synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) at bulk scale require robust, straightforward, and cost&#8208;effective techniques. However, the traditional solvothermal synthetic methods of COFs suffer low scalability as well as requirement of sensitive reaction environment and multiday reaction time (2&#8211;10&#8197;days) which greatly restricts their practical application. Here, we report microwave assisted rapid and optimized synthesis of a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) based highly crystalline COF, TzPm&#8208;COF in second (10&#8197;sec) to minute (10&#8197;min) time scale. With increasing the reaction time from seconds to minutes crystallinity, porosity and morphological changes are observed for TzPm&#8208;COF. Owing to visible range light absorption, suitable band alignment, and low exciton binding energy (Eb=64.6&#8197;meV), TzPm&#8208;COF can efficaciously produce superoxide radical anion (O2&#8901;&#8722;) after activating molecular oxygen (O2) which eventually drives aerobic photooxidative amidation reaction with high recyclability. This photocatalytic approach works well with a variety of substituted aromatic aldehydes having electron&#8208;withdrawing or donating groups and cyclic, acyclic, primary or secondary amines with moderate to high yield. Furthermore, catalytic mechanism was established by monitoring the real&#8208;time reaction progress through in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopic (DRIFTS) study.

     alt="Microwave Assisted Fast Synthesis of a Donor-Acceptor COF Towards Photooxidative Amidation Catalysis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report a microwave-assisted rapid synthesis (in time scale, t=10&#8197;seconds to 10&#8197;minutes) of a D&#8722;A based covalent organic framework, &lt;b&gt;TzPm-COF&lt;/b&gt; towards photooxidative amidation reaction from aldehyde and amine. This photocatalytic approach works well with a variety of substituted aromatic aldehydes having electron-withdrawing or donating groups and cyclic, acyclic, primary or secondary amines with moderate to high yield.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) at bulk scale require robust, straightforward, and cost-effective techniques. However, the traditional solvothermal synthetic methods of COFs suffer low scalability as well as requirement of sensitive reaction environment and multiday reaction time (2&#8211;10&#8197;days) which greatly restricts their practical application. Here, we report microwave assisted rapid and optimized synthesis of a donor-acceptor (D&#8722;A) based highly crystalline COF, &lt;b&gt;TzPm-COF&lt;/b&gt; in second (10&#8197;sec) to minute (10&#8197;min) time scale. With increasing the reaction time from seconds to minutes crystallinity, porosity and morphological changes are observed for &lt;b&gt;TzPm-COF&lt;/b&gt;. Owing to visible range light absorption, suitable band alignment, and low exciton binding energy (E&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;=64.6&#8197;meV), &lt;b&gt;TzPm-COF&lt;/b&gt; can efficaciously produce superoxide radical anion (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) after activating molecular oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) which eventually drives aerobic photooxidative amidation reaction with high recyclability. This photocatalytic approach works well with a variety of substituted aromatic aldehydes having electron-withdrawing or donating groups and cyclic, acyclic, primary or secondary amines with moderate to high yield. Furthermore, catalytic mechanism was established by monitoring the real-time reaction progress through &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopic (DRIFTS) study.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Guiding Transient Peptide Assemblies with Structural Elements Embedded in Abiotic Phosphate Fuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We focus on fuel modifications to impact non&#8208;equilibrium systems, demonstrating how amino acid side chains within abiotic phosphates direct assembly and reactivity changes during structure formation. Through covalent binding to substrates, fuels drive the yield, the lifetime and the structural organization of transient species. Activated amino acids with varying reactivity and energy contents can pave the way for fabricating structured fuels.







Abstract
Despite great progress in the construction of non&#8208;equilibrium systems, most approaches do not consider the structure of the fuel as a critical element to control the processes. Herein, we show that the amino acid side chains (A, F, Nal) in the structure of abiotic phosphates can direct assembly and reactivity during transient structure formation. The fuels bind covalently to substrates and subsequently influence the structures in the assembly process. We focus on the ways in which the phosphate esters guide structure formation and how structures and reactivity cross regulate when constructing assemblies. Through the chemical functionalization of energy&#8208;rich aminoacyl phosphate esters, we are able to control the yield of esters and thioesters upon adding dipeptides containing tyrosine or cysteine residues. The structural elements around the phosphate esters guide the lifetime of the structures formed and their supramolecular assemblies. These properties can be further influenced by the peptide sequence of substrates, incorporating anionic, aliphatic and aromatic residues. Furthermore, we illustrate that oligomerization of esters can be initiated from a single aminoacyl phosphate ester incorporating a tyrosine residue (Y). These findings suggest that activated amino acids with varying reactivity and energy contents can pave the way for designing and fabricating structured fuels.

         <title>Unraveling the Origin of Multichannel Circularly Polarized Luminescence in a Pyrene&#8208;Functionalized Topologically Chiral [2]Catenane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) are promising platform for developing functionalized artificial molecular machines. The construction of chiral MIMs with appealing circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties has boosted their potential application in biomedicine and optical industry. However, there is currently little knowledge about the CPL emission mechanism as well as the emission dynamics of these related MIMs. Herein, we demonstrate that time&#8208;resolved circularly polarized luminescence (TRCPL) spectroscopy combined with transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy offers a feasible approach to elucidate the origins of CPL emission in pyrene&#8208;functionalized topologically chiral [2]catenane as well as in a series of pyrene&#8208;functionalized chiral molecules. For the first time, direct evidence differentiating the chiroptical signals originating from either topological (local state emission) or Euclidean chirality (excimer state emission) in these pyrene&#8208;functionalized chiral molecules has been discovered. Our work not only establishes a novel and ideal methodology to study CPL mechanism, but also provides a theoretical foundation for the rational design of novel chiral materials in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Bithiophene&#8208;Functionalized Infrared Two&#8208;Photon Absorption Metal Complexes as Single&#8208;Molecule Platforms for Synergistic Photodynamic, Photothermal, and Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;molecule&#8208;based integrated diagnosis and treatment platform for infrared two&#8208;photon excitable synergistic photodynamic, photothermal, and chemotherapy has been constructed. The most potent Ru7 enters cells via macropinocytosis and regulates DNA&#8208;related chemotherapeutic mechanisms intranuclearly and their synergistic effects with photoactivated apoptosis, ferroptosis and DNA cleavage. Ru7 exhibits high efficacy and safety in vivo for melanoma and cisplatin&#8208;resistant non&#8208;small cell lung cancer.







Abstract
A planar conjugated ligand functionalized with bithiophene and its Ru(II), Os(II), and Ir(III) complexes have been constructed as single&#8208;molecule platform for synergistic photodynamic, photothermal, and chemotherapy. The complexes have significant two&#8208;photon absorption at 808&#8197;nm and remarkable singlet oxygen and superoxide anion production in aqueous solution and cells when exposed to 808&#8197;nm infrared irradiation. The most potent Ru(II) complex Ru7 enters tumor cells via the rare macropinocytosis, locates in both nuclei and mitochondria, and regulates DNA&#8208;related chemotherapeutic mechanisms intranuclearly including DNA topoisomerase and RNA polymerase inhibition and their synergistic effects with photoactivated apoptosis, ferroptosis and DNA cleavage. Ru7 exhibits high efficacy in vivo for malignant melanoma and cisplatin&#8208;resistant non&#8208;small cell lung cancer tumors, with a 100&#8201;% survival rate of mice, low toxicity to normal cells and low residual rate. Such an infrared two&#8208;photon activatable metal complex may contribute to a new generation of single&#8208;molecule&#8208;based integrated diagnosis and treatment platform to address drug resistance in clinical practice and phototherapy for large, deeply located solid tumors.

         <title>Palladium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Nondirected Late&#8208;Stage C(sp2)&#8722;H Deuteration of Heteroarenes Enabled Through a Multi&#8208;Substrate Screening Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a method for the Pd&#8208;catalyzed deuteration of heteroarenes. Reaction optimization was performed using a multi&#8208;substrate screening approach, which enabled the identification of optimal reaction conditions for different classes of heteroarenes from a minimal number of screening reactions. These conditions allowed us to deuterate various heteroarenes, including bioactive molecules.







Abstract
The importance of deuterium labelling in a variety of applications, ranging from mechanistic studies to drug&#8208;discovery, has spurred immense interest in the development of new methods for its efficient incorporation in organic, and especially in bioactive molecules. The five&#8208;membered heteroarenes at the center of this work are ubiquitous motifs in bioactive molecules and efficient methods for the deuterium labelling of these compounds are therefore highly desirable. However, the profound differences in chemical properties encountered between different heteroarenes hamper the development of a single set of broadly applicable reaction conditions, often necessitating a separate optimization campaign for a given type of heteroarene. In this study we describe the use of a multi&#8208;substrate screening approach to identify optimal reaction conditions for different classes of heteroarenes from a minimal number of screening reactions. Using this approach, four sets of complementary reaction conditions derived from our dual ligand&#8208;based palladium catalysts for nondirected C(sp2)&#8722;H activation were identified, that together enable the deuteration of structurally diverse heteroarenes, including bioactive molecules.

         <title>Shell Modulation of Hollow Metal Sulfide Nanocomposite for Stable Potassium Storage at Room and High Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hollow ZnS@C architecture with a precise shell modulation is reported to be very effective at stabling the high&#8208;capacity electrodes for high&#8208;performance KIBs anode at room and high temperature. An interesting structure&#8208;function correlation was revealed: with an increase in the shell thickness, the cyclability increases while the capacity decreases.







Abstract
The large size of K&#8208;ion makes the pursuit of stable high&#8208;capacity anodes for K&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) a formidable challenge, particularly for high temperature KIBs as the electrode instability becomes more aggravated with temperature climbing.

     alt="Shell Modulation of Hollow Metal Sulfide Nanocomposite for Stable Potassium Storage at Room and High Temperature"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hollow ZnS@C architecture with a precise shell modulation is reported to be very effective at stabling the high-capacity electrodes for high-performance KIBs anode at room and high temperature. An interesting structure-function correlation was revealed: with an increase in the shell thickness, the cyclability increases while the capacity decreases.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The large size of K-ion makes the pursuit of stable high-capacity anodes for K-ion batteries (KIBs) a formidable challenge, particularly for high temperature KIBs as the electrode instability becomes more aggravated with temperature climbing. Herein, we demonstrate that a hollow ZnS@C nanocomposite (h-ZnS@C) with a precise shell modulation can resist electrode disintegration to enable stable high-capacity potassium storage at room and high temperature. Based on a model electrode, we identify an interesting structure-function correlation of the h-ZnS@C: with an increase in the shell thickness, the cyclability increases while the rate and capacity decrease, shedding light on the design of high-performance h-ZnS@C anodes via engineering the shell thickness. Typically, the h-ZnS@C anode with a shell thickness of 60&#8197;nm can deliver an impressive comprehensive performance at room temperature; the h-ZnS@C with shell thickness increasing to 75&#8197;nm can achieve an extraordinary stability (88.6&#8201;% capacity retention over 450 cycles) with a high capacity (450&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and a superb rate even at an extreme temperature of 60&#8201;&#176;C, which is much superior than those reported anodes. This contribution envisions new perspectives on rational design of functional metal sulfides composite toward high-performance KIBs with insights into the significant structure-function correlation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Radical&#8208;Induced Photochromic Silver(I) Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: Alternative Topology, Dynamic Photoluminescence and Efficient Photothermal Conversion Modulated by Anionic Guests</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photogenerated radicals in silver(I) metal&#8211;organic frameworks with alternative topology devote to achieving wide CIE color space tunability and the switching of admirable NIR photothermal conversion.







Abstract
Photogenerated radicals are an indispensable member of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photochromic material family, as they can effectively modulate the photoluminescence and photothermal conversion performance of radical&#8208;induced photochromic complexes. Herein, two novel radical&#8208;induced photochromic metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), [Ag(TEPE)](AC)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;7/4H2O&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;5/4EtOH (1) and [Ag(TEPE)](NC)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;EtOH (2), are reported. Distinctly different topological networks can be obtained by judiciously introducing alternative &#960;&#8208;conjugated anionic guests, including a new topological structure (named as sfm) first reported in this work, describing as 4,4,4,4&#8208;c net. EPR data and UV&#8211;Vis spectra prove the radical&#8208;induced photochromic mechanism. Dynamic photochromism exhibits tunability in a wide CIE color space, with a linear segment from yellow to red for 1, while a curved coordinate line for 2, resulting in colorful emission from blue to orange. Moreover, photogenerated TEPE* radicals effectively activate the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal conversion effect of MOFs. Under 1&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 808&#8197;nm laser irradiation, the surface temperatures of photoproducts 1* and 2* can reach ~160&#8201;&#176;C and ~120&#8201;&#176;C, respectively, with competitive NIR photothermal conversion efficiencies &#951;=51.8&#8201;% (1*) and 36.2&#8201;% (2*). This work develops a feasible electrostatic compensation strategy to accurately introduce photoactive anionic guests into MOFs to construct multifunctional radical&#8208;induced photothermal conversion materials with tunable photoluminescence behavior.

         <title>On the Dendrite&#8208;Suppressing Effect of Laser&#8208;Processed Polylactic Acid&#8208;Derived Carbon Coated Zinc Anode in Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bare Zn metal when used as anode in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs), is prone to dendrite formation and parasitic side reactions due to uneven Zn deposition on its surface. A porous carbon layer derived from the laser&#8208;assisted carbonization of bio&#8208;derived polylactic acid (PLA) on Zn metal effectively mitigates the formation of dendrites and parasitic side reactions on the Zn anode, thereby enhancing the stability and lifespan of the battery.







Abstract
A major bottleneck limiting the commercialization of aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) is dendrite formation on the zinc (Zn) anode during the plating/stripping process, which leads to rapid deterioration in performance and, consequently to the device failure. In this regard, researchers are trying to design more stable anodes toward suppressing dendrite formation. One possible solution to tackle this problem and to extend the cycling life of AZIBs is to modify the zinc anode surface by coating carbonaceous materials, enabling more controlled charge flux and uniform ion distribution. This work reports sustainable and bio&#8208;derived polylactic acid (PLA) as a coating layer on the zinc anode. Carbonizing this polymer under ambient conditions using a high&#8208;power nanosecond laser forms a carbon&#8208;coated zinc foil, which was directly utilized as the anode in aqueous zinc ion batteries. The fabricated laser&#8208;processed PLA&#8208;derived carbon&#8208;coated zinc anode demonstrated an extended cycling life of almost 1600&#8197;hours, significantly outperforming the bare zinc anode. A full aqueous zinc ion battery assembled from as&#8208;modified anode and as&#8208;prepared V2O5 nanofibers as cathode was able to deliver a specific capacity of 238&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention of 70&#8201;% after 1000 cycles.

         <title>An Unprecedented [BO2]&#8208;Based Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Transparent Nonlinear Optical Crystal by Superhalogen Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first [BO2]&#8208;based deep&#8208;UV transparent NLO oxide K9[B4O5(OH)4]3(CO3)(BO2) has been synthesized by an ambient aqueous evaporation method. It possesses a strong phase&#8208;matchable SHG, a short UV absorption edge, and a significantly enlarged birefringence by a superhalogen substitution strategy.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state structures with the superhalogen [BO2]&#8722; have thus far only been observed with a few compounds whose syntheses require high reaction temperatures and complicated procedures, while their optical properties remain almost completely unexplored. Herein, we report a facile, energy&#8208;efficient synthesis of the first [BO2]&#8208;based deep&#8208;ultraviolet (deep&#8208;UV) transparent oxide K9[B4O5(OH)4]3(CO3)(BO2)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;7H2O (KBCOB). Detailed structural characterization and analysis confirm that KBCOB possesses a rare four&#8208;in&#8208;one three&#8208;dimensional quasi&#8208;honeycomb framework, with three &#960;&#8208;conjugated anions ([BO2]&#8722;, [BO3]3&#8722;, and [CO3]2&#8722;) and one non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated anion ([BO4]5&#8722;) in the one crystal. The evolution from the traditional halogenated nonlinear optical (NLO) analogues to KBCOB by superhalogen [BO2]&#8722; substitution confers deep&#8208;UV transparency (&lt;190&#8197;nm), a large second&#8208;harmonic generation response (1.0&#215;KH2PO4 @&#8197;1064&#8197;nm), and a 15&#8208;fold increase in birefringence. This study affords a new route to the facile synthesis of functional [BO2]&#8208;based oxides, paving the way for the development of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performing deep&#8208;UV NLO materials.

         <title>An MBene Modulating the Buried SnO2/Perovskite Interface in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new 2D material MBene is introduced into the buried interface of perovskite solar cells, it can strongly interact with both SnO2 and perovskite layer at the same time, forming a bridge at the buried interface, improving the charge transfer, and regulating the energy level structure, resulting in an enhanced power conversion efficiency of 24.32&#8201;% and better stability.







Abstract
The interface of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) plays an important role in transferring and collecting charges. Interface defects are important factors affecting the efficiency and stability of PSCs. Here, the buried interface between SnO2 and the perovskite layer is bridged by two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MBene, which improves charge transfer. MBene can deposit additional electrons on the surface of SnO2, passivate its surface defects and facilitate the charge collection. Moreover, the dipole moment formed at the interface increases the electron transfer ability in the PSCs. MBene also regulates the growth of perovskite crystals, improves the quality of perovskite films, and reduces its grain boundary defects. As a result, PSCs based on FA0.2MA0.8PbI3 and (FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05 get the enhanced efficiencies of 22.34&#8201;% and 24.32&#8201;% with negligible hysteresis. Furthermore, the optimized device exhibits better stability. This work opens up the application of MBene materials in PSCs, reveals a deeper understanding of the mechanism behind using 2D materials as an interface modification layer, and shows opportunities for using MBene as potential material in photoelectric devices.

         <title>Solvation Properties of Neutral Gold Species in Supercritical Water Studied By THz Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold clusters in aqueous supercritial solution are found to interact very strongly with the solvent, forming well&#8208;defined metal&#8208;water solvation complexes. Their THz spectrum is distinctly different from that of supercritical water, which can be exploited to probe such neutral metal species in hydrothermal fluids.







Abstract
Supercritical water provides distinctly different solvation properties compared to what is known from liquid water. Despite its prevalence deep in the Earth's crust and its role in chemosynthetic ecosystems in the vicinity of hydrothermal vents, molecular insights into its solvation mechanisms are still very scarce compared to what is known for liquid water. Recently, neutral metal particles have been detected in hydrothermal fluids and proposed to explain the transport of gold species to ore deposits on Earth. Using ab initio molecular dynamics, we elucidate the solvation properties of small gold species at supercritical conditions. The neutral metal clusters themselves contribute enormous THz intensity not because of their intramolecular vibrations, but due to their pronounced electronic polarization coupling to the dynamical supercritical solvent, leading to a continuum absorption up to about 1000&#8197;cm&#8722;1. On top, long&#8208;lived interactions between the gold clusters and solvation water leads at these supercritical conditions to a sharp THz resonance that happens to be close to the one due to H&#8208;bonding in liquid water at ambient conditions. The resulting distinct resonances can be used to analyse the solvation properties of neutral metal particles in supercritical aqueous solutions.

         <title>Revealing the Mechanism of Combining Best Properties of Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Catalysis in Hybrid Pd/NHC Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research explores the formation of hybrid nanoscale metal species from molecular precatalysts, which exhibit the unique attributes of molecular complexes and nanoparticles. This study addresses their detection difficulties and introduces solid&#8208;state NMR to demonstrate the generation of catalytically active Pd nanoparticles from Pd/NHC complexes. The findings underscore the critical role of NHC ligands in catalytic nanoparticle system stability and activity.







Abstract
The formation of transient hybrid nanoscale metal species from homogeneous molecular precatalysts has been demonstrated by in situ NMR studies of catalytic reactions involving transition metals with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands (M/NHC). These hybrid structures provide benefits of both molecular complexes and nanoparticles, enhancing the activity, selectivity, flexibility, and regulation of active species. However, they are challenging to identify experimentally due to the unsuitability of standard methods used for homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysis. Utilizing a sophisticated solid&#8208;state NMR technique, we provide evidence for the formation of NHC&#8208;ligated catalytically active Pd nanoparticles (PdNPs) from Pd/NHC complexes during catalysis. The coordination of NHCs via C(NHC)&#8722;Pd bonding to the metal surface was first confirmed by observing the Knight shift in the 13C NMR spectrum of the frozen reaction mixture. Computational modeling revealed that as little as few NHC ligands are sufficient for complete ligation of the surface of the formed PdNPs. Catalytic experiments combined with in situ NMR studies confirmed the significant effect of surface covalently bound NHC ligands on the catalytic properties of the PdNPs formed by decomposition of the Pd/NHC complexes. This observation shows the crucial influence of NHC ligands on the activity and stability of nanoparticulate catalytic systems.

         <title>Silylenes with a Small Chalcogenide Substituent: Tuning Frontier Orbital Energies from O to Te</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acyclic dicoordinated silylenes with small chalcogenide substituents were prepared and characterised, enabled by a bulky carbazolyl scaffold. The electronic properties change dramatically from O to Te, with decreasing HOMO&#8211;LUMO gaps and increasing chemical shift of the 29Si NMR resonances.







Abstract
The general synthesis of heteroleptic acyclic silylenes with a bulky carbazolyl substituent (dtbpCbz) is detailed and a series of compounds with a chalcogenide substituent of the type [(dtbpCbz)SiE16R] (E16R=OtBu, SEt, SePh, TePh) is reported. With the bulky carbazolyl substituent present, the chalcogenide moiety can be very small, as is shown by incorporating groups as small as ethyl, phenyl or tert&#8208;butyl. For the first time, the electronic properties of the silylene can be tuned along a complete series of chalcogenide substituents. The effects are clearly visible in the NMR and UV/Vis spectra, and were rationalised by DFT computations. The reactivity of the heaviest chalcogenide&#8208;substituted silylenes was probed by reactions with trimethylphosphine selenide and the terphenyl azide TerN3 (Ter=2,6&#8208;dimesitylphenyl).

         <title>Asymmetric Coordination Regulating D&#8208;Orbital Spin&#8208;Electron Filling in Single&#8208;Atom Iron Catalyst for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enhance the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C electrocatalyst, we implemented an asymmetric coordination within the first coordination shell of Fe site. The creation of the Fe&#8722;N3O configuration, characterized by asymmetrical oxygen coordination and adjacent defect, caused electrons in d orbitals from low&#8208;spin state to a medium&#8208;spin state. This optimization effectively weakened the adsorption of oxygen species and altered the potential&#8208;determining step.







Abstract
The single&#8208;atom Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst has shown great promise for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), yet the intrinsic activity is not satisfactory. There is a pressing need to gain a deeper understanding of the charge configuration of the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst and to develop rational modulation strategies. Herein, we have prepared a single&#8208;atom Fe catalyst with the co&#8208;coordination of N and O (denoted as Fe&#8722;N/O&#8722;C) and adjacent defect, proposing a strategy to optimize the d&#8208;orbital spin&#8208;electron filling of Fe sites by fine&#8208;tuning the first coordination shell. The Fe&#8722;N/O&#8722;C exhibits significantly better ORR activity compared to its Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C counterpart and commercial Pt/C, with a much more positive half&#8208;wave potential (0.927&#8197;V) and higher kinetic current density. Moreover, using the Fe&#8722;N/O&#8722;C catalyst, the Zn&#8208;air battery and proton exchange membrane fuel cell achieve peak power densities of up to 490 and 1179&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. Theoretical studies and in situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy reveal that Fe&#8722;N/O&#8722;C undergoes charge redistribution and negative shifting of the d&#8208;band center compared to Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C, thus optimizing the adsorption free energy of ORR intermediates. This work demonstrates the feasibility of introducing an asymmetric first coordination shell for single&#8208;atom catalysts and provides a new optimization direction for their practical application.

         <title>Crown Ether Electrolyte Induced Li2O2 Amorphization for Low Polarization and Long Lifespan Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coronal 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 ether shows strong affinity towards Li+, which stabilizes not only the intermediate LiO2 but also the resulting product. This transforms the typical crystalline Li2O2 into an amorphous state, thereby significantly reduces the product decomposition barriers. Thus, Li&#8208;O2 batteries shows lower charge overpotential and longer lifespan.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries possess an extremely high theoretical energy density, rendering them a prime candidate for next&#8208;generation secondary batteries. However, they still face multiple problems such as huge charge polarization and poor life, which lay a significant gap between laboratory research and commercial applications. In this work, we adopt 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 ether (C15) as solvent to regulate the generation of discharge products in lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries. The coronal structure endows C15 with strong affinity to Li+, firmly stabilizes the intermediate LiO2 and discharge product Li2O2. Thus, the crystalline Li2O2 is amorphized into easily decomposable amorphous products. The lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries assembled with 0.5&#8197;M C15 electrolyte show an increased discharge capacity from 4.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 to 5.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a low charge overpotential of 0.88&#8197;V during the whole lifespan at 0.05&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The batteries with 1&#8197;M C15 electrolyte can cycle stably for 140&#8197;cycles. Furthermore, the amorphous characteristic of Li2O2 product is preserved when matched with redox mediators such as LiI, with the charge polarization further decreasing to 0.74&#8197;V over a cycle life of 190&#8197;cycles. This provides new possibilities for electrolyte design to promote Li2O2 amorphization and reduce charge overpotential in lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries.

         <title>Water and Air Stable Copper(I) Complexes of Tetracationic Catenane Ligands for Oxidative C&#8722;C Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper(I) molecular catalysts that are water soluble and stable against oxidative degradation are obtained by the strategic use of multiply charged catenane ligands. By using the new catalysts, oxidative C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling is realized in water using H2O2 as a green and convenient oxidant, highlighting the potential of ligand interlocking in leveraging transition metal catalysis under challenging conditions.







Abstract
Aqueous soluble and stable Cu(I) molecular catalysts featuring a catenane ligand composed of two dicationic, mutually repelling but mechanically interlocked macrocycles are reported. The ligand interlocking not only fine&#8208;tunes the coordination sphere and kinetically stabilizes the Cu(I) against air oxidation and disproportionation, but also buries the hydrophobic portions of the ligands and prevents their dissociation which are necessary for their good water solubility and a sustained activity. These catenane Cu(I) complexes can catalyze the oxidative C&#8722;C coupling of indoles and tetrahydroisoquinolines in water, using H2O2 as a green oxidant with a good substrate scope. The successful use of catenane ligands in exploiting aqueous Cu(I) catalysis thus highlights the many unexplored potential of mechanical bond as a design element for exploring transition metal catalysis under challenging conditions.

         <title>Repurposing Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Excited Ene&#8208;Reductases for Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Lactones Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual bio&#8208;/photocatalytic system has been developed for achieving previously elusive diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective radical lactonizations. By integrating directed evolution and photoinduced single&#8208;electron oxidation, we repurposed engineered ene&#8208;reductases to steer non&#8208;natural radical C&#8722;O formations giving a diverse array of enantioenhanced 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered lactones with vicinal stereocenters, part of which bears a quaternary stereocenter.







Abstract
Repurposing enzymes to catalyze non&#8208;natural asymmetric transformations that are difficult to achieve using traditional chemical methods is of significant importance. Although radical C&#8722;O bond formation has emerged as a powerful approach for constructing oxygen&#8208;containing compounds, controlling the stereochemistry poses a great challenge. Here we present the development of a dual bio&#8208;/photo&#8208;catalytic system comprising an ene&#8208;reductase and an organic dye for achieving stereoselective lactonizations. By integrating directed evolution and photoinduced single electron oxidation, we repurposed engineered ene&#8208;reductases to steer non&#8208;natural radical C&#8722;O formations (one C&#8722;O bond for hydrolactonizations and lactonization&#8208;alkylations while two C&#8722;O bonds for lactonization&#8208;oxygenations). This dual catalysis gave a new approach to a diverse array of enantioenhanced 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered lactones with vicinal stereocenters, part of which bears a quaternary stereocenter (up to 99&#8201;% enantiomeric excess, up to 12.9&#8201;:&#8201;1 diastereomeric ratio). Detailed mechanistic studies, including computational simulations, uncovered the synergistic effect of the enzyme and the externally added organophotoredox catalyst Rh6G.

         <title>Hyperbranched Vitrimer for Ultrahigh Energy Dissipation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymers have been utilized as damping materials due to the high internal friction of molecular chains, enabling effectively dissipate energy as heat during service. Our work firstly presents hyperbranched vitrimers (HBVs) containing dense pendant chains and loose dynamic crosslinked networks, which exhibit ultrahigh energy&#8208;dissipation performance over a broad frequency range of nearly 10 orders of magnitude. This innovative design concept will provide opportunities for the further development of damping materials with multiple synergistic effects.







Abstract
Polymers are ideally utilized as damping materials due to the high internal friction of molecular chains, enabling effective suppression of vibrations and noises in various fields. Current strategies rely on broadening the glass transition region or introducing additional relaxation components to enhance the energy dissipation capacity of polymeric damping materials. However, it remains a significant challenge to achieve high damping efficiency through structural control while maintaining dynamic characteristics. In this work, we propose a new strategy to develop hyperbranched vitrimers (HBVs) containing dense pendant chains and loose dynamic crosslinked networks. A novel yet weak dynamic transesterification between the carboxyl and boronic acid ester was confirmed and used to prepare HBVs based on poly (hexyl methacrylate&#8208;2&#8208;(4&#8208;ethenylphenyl)&#8208;5,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;dioxaborinane) P(HMA&#8208;co&#8208;ViCL) copolymers. The

&#8208;type of macromonomers, the crosslinking points formed by the dynamic covalent connection via the associative exchange, and the weak yet dynamic exchange reaction are the three keys to developing high&#8208;performance HBV damping materials. We found that P(HMA&#8208;co&#8208;ViCL) 20k&#8208;40&#8208;60&#8197;HBV exhibited ultrahigh energy&#8208;dissipation performance over a broad frequency and temperature range, attributed to the synergistic effect of dense pendant chains and weak dynamic covalent crosslinks. This unique design concept will provide a general approach to developing advanced damping materials.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Low&#8208;Potential Methanol Oxidation on Single&#8208;Ir&#8208;Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under the coupling of thermocatalysis and electrocatalysis, methanol was first thermally catalyzed to decompose to CO and H2 under the voltage promotion, then the generated CO and H2 was electrochemically oxidized to CO2 and proton at ultra&#8208;low onset potential (&lt;0.1&#8197;V) over the the electron&#8208;deficient IrC4 sites, which strongly adsorb the methanol to break H&#8722;O/H&#8722;C.







Abstract
Methanol oxidation plays a central role to implement sustainable energy economy, which is restricted by the sluggish reaction kinetics due to the multi&#8208;electron transfer process accompanied by numerous sequential intermediate. In this study, an efficient cascade methanol oxidation reaction is catalyzed by single&#8208;Ir&#8208;atom catalyst at ultra&#8208;low potential (&lt;0.1&#8197;V) with the promotion of the thermal and electrochemical integration in a high temperature polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzer.

&lt;p&gt;Under the coupling of thermocatalysis and electrocatalysis, methanol was first thermally catalyzed to decompose to CO and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under the voltage promotion, then the generated CO and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was electrochemically oxidized to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and proton at ultra-low onset potential (&amp;lt;0.1&#8197;V) over the the electron-deficient IrC&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sites, which strongly adsorb the methanol to break H&#8722;O/H&#8722;C.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methanol oxidation plays a central role to implement sustainable energy economy, which is restricted by the sluggish reaction kinetics due to the multi-electron transfer process accompanied by numerous sequential intermediate. In this study, an efficient cascade methanol oxidation reaction is catalyzed by single-Ir-atom catalyst at ultra-low potential (&amp;lt;0.1&#8197;V) with the promotion of the thermal and electrochemical integration in a high temperature polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzer. At the elevated temperature, the electron deficient Ir site with higher methanol affinity could spontaneous catalyze the CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH dehydrogenation to CO under the voltage, then the generated CO and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was electrochemically oxidized to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and proton. However, the methanol cannot thermally decompose with the voltage absence, which confirm the indispensable of the coupling of thermal and electrochemical integration for the methanol oxidation. By assembling the methanol oxidation reaction with hydrogen evolution reaction with single-Ir-atom catalysts in the anode chamber, a max hydrogen production rate reaches 18&#8197;mol&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;Ir&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is much greater than that of Ir nanoparticles and commercial Pt/C. This study also demonstrated the electrochemical methanol oxidation activity of the single atom catalysts, which broadens the renewable energy devices and the catalyst design by an integration concept.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boron&#8208;Catalyzed C1 Copolymerization of Arsonium and Sulfoxonium Ylides toward Unrepresented Structures and Fluorescence Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of two novel arsonium ylides is achieved and used in the C1 copolymerization with dimethylsulfoxonium methylide. A third unexpected C1 unit resulting from a double bond rearrangement is confirmed by NMR. In addition, an unexpected red shift in the fluorescence spectrum is observed which is attributed to a phenomenon similar to through&#8208;space conjugation.







Abstract
The first synthesis of well&#8208;defined poly(methylene&#8208;co&#8208;1,1&#8208;diphenylpropenenylene) (C1&#8208;co&#8208;C1&#8217;), equivalent to poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;diphenylbutadiene) copolymers was accomplished by C1 copolymerization of novel diphenylpropenyl triphenyl arsonium ylides (Ph2AY) and dimethylsulfoxonium methylide (Me2SY) using B&#8208;thexylborepane as initiator. All polymerization conditions, including feed ratio, temperature, and reaction time, were optimized. A series of photoluminescent poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;diphenylbutadiene)s were synthesized at different feed ratios, opening a new synthetic horizon for poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;disubstitutedbutadiene) copolymers. Notably, a new C1 segment, arising from a double bond rearrangement, was confirmed by NMR, resulting in an unprecedented two&#8208;monomer three&#8208;structure random terpolymer. An unexpected red&#8208;shift phenomenon in the fluorescence spectra was observed with increasing the ratio of Ph2AY in the copolymer. This shift is attributed to the aggregation of diphenylbutadiene segment, similar to through&#8208;space conjugation (TSC), likely induced by a decrease in the crystallinity of copolymers. Furthermore, another disubstituted allylic triphenyl arsonium ylides, (E)&#8208;2&#8208;phenylbutenyl triphenyl arsonium ylide (MePhAY) was also synthesized and investigated. These additional compounds expand the knowledge and the potential applications of such copolymerization techniques in advanced materials.

         <title>Quantitative Factors Introduced in the Feasibility Analysis of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)&#8208;Sensitive Triggers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Success of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) triggered prodrug activation relies on two key functions: (1) sufficient magnitude of concentration difference for the interested ROS between normal tissue/cells and the intended site of delivery, (2) appropriate reaction kinetics to ensure a sufficient level of payload release. Herein, we examine ROS concentrations under various pathophysiological conditions and critically analyze ROS&#8208;triggered prodrug.







Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are critical for cellular signaling. Various pathophysiological conditions are also associated with elevated levels of ROS. Hence, ROS&#8208;sensitive triggers have been extensively used for selective payload delivery. Such applications are predicated on two key functions: (1) a sufficient magnitude of concentration difference for the interested ROS between normal tissue/cells and intended sites and (2) appropriate reaction kinetics to ensure a sufficient level of selectivity for payload release. Further, ROS refers to a group of species with varying reactivity, which should not be viewed as a uniform group. In this review, we critically analyze data on the concentrations of different ROS species under various pathophysiological conditions and examine how reaction kinetics affect the success of ROS&#8208;sensitive linker chemistry. Further, we discuss different ROS linker chemistry in the context of their applications in drug delivery and imaging. This review brings new insights into research in ROS&#8208;triggered delivery, highlights factors to consider in maximizing the chance for success and discusses pitfalls to avoid.

         <title>Template&#8208;Guided Silicon Micromotor Assembly for Enhanced Cell Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optomagnetic hybrid micromotor was developed using an optimized silicon&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Insulator&#8208;Semiconductor (MIS) solar cell. The micromotor displays diverse motion modes influenced by fracture surfaces and interactions with the environment. Additionally, an innovative hole&#8208;assisted assembly strategy is introduced, facilitating assembly into functional microrobots and enabling precise cell manipulation.







Abstract
Light&#8208;driven micro/nanorobots (LMNRs) are tiny, untethered machines with great potential in fields like precision medicine, nano manufacturing, and various other domains. However, their practicality hinges on developing light&#8208;manipulation strategies that combine versatile functionalities, flexible design options, and precise controllability. Our study introduces an innovative approach to construct micro/nanorobots (MNRs) by utilizing micro/nanomotors as fundamental building blocks. Inspired by silicon Metal&#8208;Insulator&#8208;Semiconductor (MIS) solar cell principles, we design a new type of optomagnetic hybrid micromotors (OHMs). These OHMs have been skillfully optimized with integrated magnetic constituent, resulting in efficient light propulsion, precise magnetic navigation, and the potential for controlled assembly. One of the key features of the OHMs is their ability to exhibit diverse motion modes influenced by fracture surfaces and interactions with the environment, streamlining cargo conveyance along &#8220;micro expressway&#8221;&#8212;the predesigned microchannels. Further enhancing their versatility, a template&#8208;guided assembly strategy facilitates the assembly of these micromotors into functional microrobots, encompassing various configurations such as &#8220;V&#8208;shaped&#8221;, &#8220;N&#8208;shaped&#8221;, and 3D structured microrobots. The heightened capabilities of these microrobots, underscore the innovative potential inherent in hybrid micromotor design and assembly, which provides a foundational platform for the realization of multi&#8208;component microrobots. Our work moves a step toward forthcoming microrobotic entities boasting advanced functionalities.

         <title>Formation of Supernarrow Borophene Nanoribbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of supernarrow borophene nanoribbons has been experimentally realized. The ribbons have a uniform width of &#8764;10&#8197;&#197; and can be as long as 200&#8197;&#197;. They are embedded in the outermost layer of Au(111) and shielded on top by evacuated Au atoms. Distinct edge states are revealed from the ribbons, which are primarily attributed to the localized spin at their zigzag edges.







Abstract
Borophenes have sparked considerable interest owing to their fascinating physical characteristics and diverse polymorphism. However, borophene nanoribbons (BNRs) with widths less than 2&#8197;nm have not been achieved. Herein, we report the experimental realization of supernarrow BNRs. Combining scanning tunneling microscopy imaging with density functional theory modeling and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that, under the applied growth conditions, boron atoms can penetrate the outermost layer of Au(111) and form BNRs composed of a pair of zigzag (2,2) boron rows. The BNRs have a width self&#8208;contained to &#8764;1&#8197;nm and dipoles at the edges to keep them separated. They are embedded in the outermost Au layer and shielded on top by the evacuated Au atoms, free of the need for post&#8208;passivation. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals distinct edge states, primarily attributed to the localized spin at the BNRs&#8217; zigzag edges. This work adds a new member to the boron material family and introduces a new physical feature to borophenes.

         <dc:description>
The ion&#8208;pair [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722;&#8208;mediated electrocatalytic benzylic C&#8722;H oxidation is described. In the absence of expensive oxidants and external supporting electrolyte, the selective oxidation of benzylic C&#8722;H bonds in air was achieved.







Abstract
The selective oxidation of benzylic C&#8722;H bonds is a pivotal transformation in organic synthesis. Undoubtedly, achieving efficient and highly selective aerobic oxidation of methylarenes to benzaldehydes has been highly challenging due to the propensity of benzaldehyde to undergo overoxidation under typical aerobic conditions. Herein, we propose an innovative approach to address this issue by leveraging electrocatalytic processes, facilitated by ion&#8208;pair mediators [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722;. By harnessing the power of electrochemistry, we successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of our strategy, which enables the selective oxidation of benzylic C&#8722;H bonds in benzylic molecules and toluene derivatives. Notably, our approach exhibited high efficiency, excellent selectivity, and compatibility with various functional groups, underscoring the broad applicability of our methodology.

         <title>New Alkalescent Electrolyte Chemistry for Zinc&#8208;Ferricyanide Flow Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new zinc&#8208;ferricyanide flow battery assembled with an alkalescent (pH=12) Zn&#8208;EDTA anolyte and Fe(CN)63&#8722;/Fe(CN)64&#8722; catholyte is constructed and has an energy density of ~74&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&#8722;1 at 60&#8201;&#176;C and remains stable for 1800&#8197;cycles (1800&#8197;hours) at 0&#8201;&#176;C and for &gt;1400&#8197;cycles (2300&#8197;hours) at 25&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Alkaline zinc&#8208;ferricyanide flow batteries are efficiency and economical as energy storage solutions. However, they suffer from low energy density and short calendar life. The strongly alkaline conditions (3&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 OH&#8722;) reduce the solubility of ferri/ferro&#8208;cyanide (normally only 0.4&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C) and induce the formation of zinc dendrites at the anode. Here, we report a new zinc&#8208;ferricyanide flow battery based on a mild alkalescent (pH&#8197;12) electrolyte. Using a chelating agent to rearrange ferri/ferro&#8208;cyanide ion&#8208;solvent interactions and improve salt dissociation, we increased the solubility of ferri/ferro&#8208;cyanide to 1.7&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 and prevented zinc dendrites. Our battery has an energy density of ~74&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&#8722;1catholyte at 60&#8201;&#176;C and remains stable for 1800&#8197;cycles (1800&#8197;hours) at 0&#8201;&#176;C and for &gt;1400&#8197;cycles (2300&#8197;hours) at 25&#8201;&#176;C. An alkalescent zinc&#8208;ferricyanide cell stack built using this alkalescent electrolyte stably delivers 608&#8197;W of power for ~40&#8197;days.

         <title>Single&#8208;cluster Functionalized TiO2 Nanotube Array for Boosting Water Oxidation and CO2 Photoreduction to CH3OH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile electrosynthesis strategy was developed to achieve single dispersion of various POMs on TiO2 nanotube array. The POMs can serve as electronic sponge to store multi&#8208;electrons thus greatly improving the surface hole concentration to promote water oxidation. The left electron on P2Mo18@TiO2 can effeiciently drive CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH3OH conversion with much enhanced performance compared to that of pristine TiO2 nanoarray.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction and water oxidation to liquid fuels represents a promising solution to alleviate energy crisis and climate issue, but it remains a great challenge for generating CH3OH and CH3CH2OH dominated by multi&#8208;electron transfer. Single&#8208;cluster catalysts with super electron acceptance, accurate molecular structure, customizable electronic structure and multiple adsorption sites, have led to greater potential in catalyzing various challenging reactions. However, accurately controlling the number and arrangement of clusters on functional supports still faces great challenge. Herein, we develop a facile electrosynthesis method to uniformly disperse Wells&#8208;Dawson&#8208; and Keggin&#8208;type polyoxometalates on TiO2 nanotube arrays, resulting in a series of single&#8208;cluster functionalized catalysts P2M18O62@TiO2 and PM12O40@TiO2 (M=Mo or W). The single polyoxometalate cluster can be distinctly identified and serves as electronic sponge to accept electrons from excited TiO2 for enhancing surface&#8208;hole concentration and promote water oxidation. Among these samples, P2Mo18O62@TiO2&#8208;1 exhibits the highest electron consumption rate of 1260&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH3OH conversion with H2O as the electron source, which is 11&#8197;times higher than that of isolated TiO2 nanotube arrays. This work supplied a simple synthesis method to realize the single&#8208;dispersion of molecular cluster to enrich surface&#8208;reaching holes on TiO2, thereby facilitating water oxidation and CO2 reduction.

         <title>Dilute RuCo Alloy Synergizing Single Ru and Co Atoms as Efficient and CO&#8208;Resistant Anode Catalyst for Anion Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing low&#8208;cost, highly active, stable, and CO resistant alkaline HOR electrocatalysts are crucial for achieving the application of AEMFCs. (RuCo)NC+SAs/N&#8208;CNT with and dilute RuCo alloy nanoparticles and highly dispersed Ru and Co single atoms can achieve efficient alkaline HOR, with superior stability and outstanding CO resistance. When used (RuCo)NC+SAs/N&#8208;CNT to AEMFC anode catalyst, AEMFCs can achieve high peak power density with low noble metal loading (1.98&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a load of 0.1&#8197;mgRu&#8201;cm&#8722;2).







Abstract
Ruthenium (Ru) is considered a promising candidate catalyst for alkaline hydroxide oxidation reaction (HOR) due to its hydrogen binding energy (HBE) like that of platinum (Pt) and its much higher oxygenophilicity than that of Pt. However, Ru still suffers from insufficient intrinsic activity and CO resistance, which hinders its widespread use in anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs). Here, we report a hybrid catalyst (RuCo)NC+SAs/N&#8208;CNT consisting of dilute RuCo alloy nanoparticles and atomically single Ru and Co atoms on N&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes The catalyst exhibits a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art activity with a high mass activity of 7.35&#8197;A&#8201;mgRu&#8722;1. More importantly, when (RuCo)NC+SAs/N&#8208;CNT is used as an anode catalyst for AEMFCs, its peak power density reaches 1.98&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is one of the best AEMFCs properties of noble metal&#8208;based catalysts at present. Moreover, (RuCo)NC+SAs/N&#8208;CNT has superior long&#8208;time stability and CO resistance. The experimental and density functional theory (DFT) results demonstrate that the dilute alloying and monodecentralization of the exotic element Co greatly modulates the electronic structure of the host element Ru, thus optimizing the adsorption of H and OH and promoting the oxidation of CO on the catalyst surface, and then stimulates alkaline HOR activity and CO tolerance of the catalyst.

         <title>Synthesis of 18F&#8208;labeled Aryl Trifluoromethyl Sulfones, &#8208;Sulfoxides, and &#8208;Sulfides for Positron Emission Tomography</title>

         <dc:description>
The mild and high&#8208;yielding synthesis of 18F&#8208;labeled aryl trifluoromethyl sulfones, &#8208;sulfoxides, and &#8208;sulfides using [18F]Ruppert&#8208;Prakash reagent is described. The application to the radiolabeling of different bioactive compounds using &gt;1&#8197;GBq of 18F&#8208;labeling reagent is demonstrated. This work expands the radiochemical space of [18F]CF3&#8208;containing structural motifs for the use in positron emission tomography.







Abstract
Positron emission tomography (PET) is becoming increasingly important in nuclear medicine and drug discovery. To date, the development of many potential PET tracers is hampered by the lack of suitable synthetic pathways for their preparation. This is particularly true for the highly desired radiolabeling of compounds bearing [18F]CF3&#8208;groups. For instance, S(O)nCF3&#8208;groups (n=0, 1, 2) serve as structural motif in a range of biologically active compounds, but their radiosynthesis remains largely unprecedented (for n=1, 2). Herein, we describe general methods for the radiosynthesis of 18F&#8208;labeled aryl trifluoromethyl sulfones, &#8208;sulfoxides, and &#8208;sulfides. All three methods are operationally straightforward, start from widely available precursors, i.e., sulfonyl fluorides and thiophenols, and make use of the recently established [18F]Ruppert&#8208;Prakash reagent. Further, the syntheses display good functional group tolerance as demonstrated by the 18F&#8208;labeling of more than 40&#8197;compounds. The applicability of the new method is demonstrated by the radiolabeling of three bioactive molecules, optionally to be used as PET tracers. In a broader context, this work presents a substantial expansion of the chemical space of radiofluorinated structural motifs to be used for the development of new PET tracers.

         <title>Facile Generation of Heterotelechelic Poly(2&#8208;Oxazoline)s Towards Accelerated Exploration of Poly(2&#8208;Oxazoline)&#8208;Based Nanomedicine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(2&#8208;oxazoline)s (POx) are promising materials for nanomedicine, yet straightforward end&#8208;group diversification strategies are necessary to promote rapid exploration of this structurally diverse polymer class. Van Guyse and Kataoka et&#8197;al. demonstrate the rapid generation of heterotelechelic POx libraries, and their subsequent use in the synthesis of block&#8208;copolymers, liposomes, and a lipid nanoparticle (LNP)&#8208;based SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 vaccine.







Abstract
Controlling the end&#8208;groups of biocompatible polymers is crucial for enabling polymer&#8208;based therapeutics and nanomedicine. Typically, end&#8208;group diversification is a challenging and time&#8208;consuming endeavor, especially for polymers prepared via ionic polymerization mechanisms with limited functional group tolerance. In this study, we present a facile end&#8208;group diversification approach for poly(2&#8208;oxazoline)s (POx), enabling quick and reliable production of heterotelechelic polymers to facilitate POxylation. The approach relies on the careful tuning of reaction parameters to establish differential reactivity of a pentafluorobenzyl initiator fragment and the living oxazolinium chain&#8208;end, allowing the selective introduction of N&#8208;, S&#8208;, O&#8208;nucleophiles via the termination of the polymerization, and a consecutive nucleophilic para&#8208;fluoro substitution. The value of this approach for the accelerated development of nanomedicine is demonstrated through the synthesis of well&#8208;defined lipid&#8208;polymer conjugates and POx&#8208;polypeptide block&#8208;copolymers, which are well&#8208;suited for drug and gene delivery. Furthermore, we investigated the application of a lipid&#8208;POx conjugate for the formulation and delivery of mRNA&#8208;loaded lipid nanoparticles for immunization against the SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 virus, underscoring the value of POx as a biocompatible polymer platform.

         <title>On&#8208;Water Surface Synthesis of Vinylene&#8208;Linked Cationic Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer Films as the Anion&#8208;Selective Electrode Coating</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two vinylene&#8208;linked cationic 2DPs (V&#8208;C2DPs) are synthesized on the water surface via Knoevenagel reaction, presenting as fully crystalline and highly oriented thin films. The obtained V&#8208;C2DPs exhibit well&#8208;defined cationic sites and 1D channels, facilitating the anion&#8208;selective transport. The integration of V&#8208;C2DPs as graphite cathode coatings into zinc&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries (ZDIBs) enables to improve its specific capacity and cycling life.







Abstract
Vinylene&#8208;linked two&#8208;dimensional polymers (V&#8208;2DPs) and their layer&#8208;stacked covalent organic frameworks (V&#8208;2D COFs) featuring high in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;conjugation and robust frameworks have emerged as promising candidates for energy&#8208;related applications. However, current synthetic approaches are restricted to producing V&#8208;2D COF powders that lack processability, impeding their integration into devices, particularly within membrane technologies reliant upon thin films. Herein, we report the novel on&#8208;water surface synthesis of vinylene&#8208;linked cationic 2DPs films (V&#8208;C2DP&#8208;1 and V&#8208;C2DP&#8208;2) via Knoevenagel polycondensation, which serve as the anion&#8208;selective electrode coating for highly&#8208;reversible and durable zinc&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries (ZDIBs). Model reactions and theoretical modeling revealed the enhanced reactivity and reversibility of the Knoevenagel reaction on the water surface. On this basis, we demonstrated the on&#8208;water surface 2D polycondensation towards V&#8208;C2DPs films that show large lateral size, tunable thickness, and high chemical stability. Representatively, V&#8208;C2DP&#8208;1 presents as a fully crystalline and face&#8208;on oriented film with in&#8208;plane lattice parameters of a=b&#8776;43.3&#8197;&#197;. Profiting from its well&#8208;defined cationic sites, oriented 1D channels, and stable frameworks, V&#8208;C2DP&#8208;1 film possesses superior bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anion (TFSI&#8722;)&#8208;transport selectivity (transference, t_=0.85) for graphite cathode in high&#8208;voltage ZDIBs, thus triggering additional TFSI&#8722;&#8208;intercalation stage and promoting its specific capacity (from ~83 to 124&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and cycling life (&gt;1000&#8197;cycles, 95&#8201;% capacity retention).

         <title>Design of 3D&#8208;Printed Heterogeneous Reactor Systems To Overcome Incompatibility Hurdles when Combining Metal and Enzyme Catalysis in a One&#8208;Pot Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of Wacker oxidation and enzymatic reduction in one reactor in spite of the use of incompatible catalysts is demonstrated. The chemoenzymatic process is based on embedding enzyme&#8208;deactivating Cu ions in a 3D&#8208;printed ceramic scaffold, which then &#8220;shields&#8221; the enzyme from the critical Cu component. By such compartmentalization, the desired product was obtained with 80&#8201;% overall conversion and excellent enantioselectivity (99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Combining chemo&#8208; and biocatalysis enables the design of novel economic and sustainable one&#8208;pot processes for the preparation of industrial chemicals, preferably proceeding in water. While a range of proofs&#8208;of&#8208;concept for the compatibility of such catalysts from these two different &#8220;worlds of catalysis&#8221; have recently been demonstrated, merging noncompatible chemo&#8208; and biocatalysts for joint applications within one reactor remained a challenge. A conceptual solution is compartmentalization of the catalytic moieties by heterogenization of critical catalyst components, thus &#8220;shielding&#8221; them from the complementary noncompatible catalyst, substrate or reagent. Exemplified for a one&#8208;pot process consisting of a metal&#8208;catalyzed Wacker oxidation and enzymatic reduction as noncompatible individual reactions steps, we demonstrate that making use of 3D printing of heterogeneous materials containing Cu as a critical metal component can overcome such incompatibility hurdles. The application of a 3D&#8208;printed Cu&#8208;ceramic device as metal catalyst component allows an efficient combination with the enzyme and the desired two&#8208;step transformation of styrene into the chiral alcohol product with high overall conversion and excellent enantioselectivity. This compartmentalization concept based on 3D printing of heterogenized metal catalysts represents a scalable methodology and opens up numerous perspectives to be used as a general tool also for other related chemoenzymatic research challenges.

This compartmentalization concept based on 3D printing of heterogenized metal catalysts represents a scalable methodology and opens up numerous perspectives to be used as a general tool also for other related chemoenzymatic research challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Deciphering Anion&#8208;Modulated Solvation Structure for Calcium Intercalation into Graphite for Ca&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

The electrostatic interactions between Ca ions and anions can regulate the solvated&#8208;Ca&#8208;ion configurations in the dimethylacetamide&#8208;based electrolytes, which govern the Ca ion storage capacities and reaction kinetics for graphite anodes in Ca ion batteries.







Abstract
Co&#8208;intercalation reactions make graphite a feasible anode in Ca ion batteries, yet the correlation between Ca ion intercalation behaviors and electrolyte structure remains unclear. This study, for the first time, elucidates the pivotal role of anions in modulating the Ca ion solvation structures and their subsequent intercalation into graphite. Specifically, the electrostatic interactions between Ca ion and anions govern the configurations of solvated&#8208;Ca&#8208;ion in dimethylacetamide&#8208;based electrolytes and graphite intercalation compounds. Among the anions considered (BH4&#8722;, ClO4&#8722;, TFSI&#8722; and [B(hfip)4]&#8722;), the coordination of four solvent molecules per Ca ion (CN=4) leads to the highest reversible capacities and the fastest reaction kinetics in graphite. Our study illuminates the origins of the distinct Ca ion intercalation behaviors across various anion&#8208;modulated electrolytes, employing a blend of experimental and theoretical approaches. Importantly, the practical viability of graphite anodes in Ca&#8208;ion full cells is confirmed, showing significant promise for advanced energy storage systems.

         <title>Multidimensional Electrochemistry Decodes the Operando Mechanism of Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining DC voltammetry and AC impedance spectroscopy, the operando mechanism of the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) conducted on a gas&#8208;diffusion electrode was decoded through data co&#8208;fitting. The reaction rates of three elementary steps (Tafel, Heyrovsky, and Volmer) over a practical potential range were thus distilled individually, revealing that the Volmer step had never been a rate determining step as presumed in previous reports.







Abstract
Being an efficient approach to the utilization of hydrogen energy, the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is of particular significance in the current carbon&#8208;neutrality time. Yet the mechanistic picture of the HOR is still blurred, mostly because the elemental steps of this reaction are rapid and highly entangled, especially when deviating from the thermodynamic equilibrium state. Here we report a strategy for decoding the HOR mechanism under operando conditions. In addition to the wide&#8208;potential&#8208;range I&#8211;V curves obtained using gas diffusion electrodes, we have applied the AC impedance spectroscopy to provide independent and complementary kinetic information. Combining multidimensional data sources has enabled us to fit, in mathematical rigor, the core kinetic parameter set in a 5&#8208;D data space. The reaction rate of the three elemental steps (Tafel, Heyrovsky, and Volmer reactions), as a function of the overpotential, can thus be distilled individually. Such an undocumented kinetic picture unravels, in detail, how the HOR is controlled by the elemental steps on polarization. For instance, at low polarization region, the Heyrovsky reaction is relatively slow and can be ignored; but at high polarization region, the Heyrovsky reaction will surpass the Tafel reaction. Additionally, the Volmer reaction has been the fastest within overpotentials of interest. Our findings not only offer a better understanding of the HOR mechanism, but also lay the foundation for the development of improved hydrogen energy utilization systems.

         <title>Magnetic Silica&#8208;Coated Fluorescent Microspheres (MagSiGlow) for Simultaneous Detection of Tumor&#8208;Associated Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid multiplexed, on&#8208;bead immune assay using highly fluorescent magnetic microspheres (MagSiGlow) loaded in microarrays to achieve simultaneous detection and co&#8208;localization of 7500 microspheres per image. We demonstrate remarkable sensitivity and an over 85&#8201;% reduction in signal cross&#8208;over in the simultaneous detection of tumor&#8208;associated protein biomarkers.







Abstract
Multiplexed bead assays for solution&#8208;phase biosensing often encounter cross&#8208;over reactions during signal amplification steps, leading to unwanted false positive and high background signals. Current solutions involve complex custom&#8208;designed and costly equipment, limiting their application in simple laboratory setup. In this study, we introduce a straightforward protocol to adapt a multiplexed single&#8208;bead assay to standard fluorescence imaging plates, enabling the simultaneous analysis of thousands of reactions per plate. This approach focuses on the design and synthesis of bright fluorescent and magnetic microspheres (MagSiGlow) with multiple fluorescent wavelengths serving as unique detection markers. The imaging&#8208;based, single&#8208;bead assay, combined with a scripted algorithm, allows the detection, segmentation, and co&#8208;localization on average of 7500 microspheres per field of view across five imaging channels in less than one second. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method with remarkable sensitivity at low protein detection limits (100&#8197;pg/mL). This technique showed over 85&#8201;% reduction in signal cross&#8208;over to the solution&#8208;based method after the concurrent detection of tumor&#8208;associated protein biomarkers. This approach holds the promise of substantially enhancing high throughput biosensing for multiple targets, seamlessly integrating with rapid image analysis algorithms.

High&#8208;temperature homopolymer dielectrics with anisotropy have been developed by leveraging the hierarchical structure in semicrystalline polymers. The unique ordering of lamellae in our dielectric films endue a significantly increased breakdown strength and a reduced leakage current compared to amorphous films.







Abstract
High&#8208;temperature dielectric polymers are in high demand for powering applications in extreme environments. Here, we have developed high&#8208;temperature homopolymer dielectrics with anisotropy by leveraging the hierarchical structure in semicrystalline polymers. The lamellae have been aligned parallel to the surface in the dielectric films. This structural arrangement resembles the horizontal alignment of nanosheet fillers in polymer nanocomposites and nanosheet&#8208;like lamellae in block copolymers, which has been proven to provide the optimal topological structure for electrical energy storage. The unique ordering of lamellae in our dielectric films endue a significantly increased breakdown strength and a reduced leakage current compared to amorphous films. This novel approach of enhancing the capacitive energy storage properties by controlled orientation of lamellae in homopolymer offers a new perspective for the design of high&#8208;temperature polymer dielectrics.

         <title>In Situ Formation of Platinum&#8208;Carbon Catalysts in Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Propane dehydrogenation over Pt nanoparticles is an essential industrial reaction to produce propylene. However, the structures that form under reaction conditions have remained elusive. Using operando transmission electron microscopy (OTEM) we found that in situ generated ordered Pt&#8722;C solid solutions are responsible for heightened selectivity. Its impact on propane dehydrogenation is discussed.







Abstract
The catalytic production of propylene via propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a key reaction in the chemical industry. By combining operando transmission electron microscopy with density functional theory analysis, we show that the intercalation and ordering of carbon on Pt interstitials to form Pt&#8722;C solid solutions is relevant for increasing propylene production. More specifically, we found that at the point of enhanced propylene formation, the structure of platinum nanoparticles is transformed into a transient caesium chloride&#8208;type Pt&#8722;C polymorph. At more elevated temperatures, the zincblende and rock salt polymorphs seemingly coexist. When propylene production was highest, multiple crystal structures consisting of Pt and carbon were occasionally found to coexist in one individual nanoparticle, distorting the Pt lattice. Catalyst coking was detected at all stages of the reaction, but did initially not affect all particles. These findings could lead to the development of novel synthesis strategies towards tailoring highly efficient PDH catalysts.

     alt="In Situ Formation of Platinum-Carbon Catalysts in Propane Dehydrogenation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Propane dehydrogenation over Pt nanoparticles is an essential industrial reaction to produce propylene. However, the structures that form under reaction conditions have remained elusive. Using &lt;i&gt;operando&lt;/i&gt; transmission electron microscopy (OTEM) we found that &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; generated ordered Pt&#8722;C solid solutions are responsible for heightened selectivity. Its impact on propane dehydrogenation is discussed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The catalytic production of propylene via propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a key reaction in the chemical industry. By combining &lt;i&gt;operando&lt;/i&gt; transmission electron microscopy with density functional theory analysis, we show that the intercalation and ordering of carbon on Pt interstitials to form Pt&#8722;C solid solutions is relevant for increasing propylene production. More specifically, we found that at the point of enhanced propylene formation, the structure of platinum nanoparticles is transformed into a transient caesium chloride-type Pt&#8722;C polymorph. At more elevated temperatures, the zincblende and rock salt polymorphs seemingly coexist. When propylene production was highest, multiple crystal structures consisting of Pt and carbon were occasionally found to coexist in one individual nanoparticle, distorting the Pt lattice. Catalyst coking was detected at all stages of the reaction, but did initially not affect all particles. These findings could lead to the development of novel synthesis strategies towards tailoring highly efficient PDH catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strategies to Diversification of the Mechanical Properties of Organic Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>

This study demonstrates the effects of halogenation on the mechanical and photomechanical behavior of organic crystals. Starting with (E)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diphenylbut&#8208;2&#8208;ene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dione, the brittle photoinert crystals evolve into mechanically flexible, photochemically reactive crystals via double and quadruple halogenation, an approach that advocates for combined chemical and crystal engineering strategies to determine the key factors determining the solid&#8208;state response dynamics.







Abstract
Structurally ordered soft materials that respond to complementary stimuli are susceptible to control over their spatial and temporal morphostructural configurations by intersectional or combined effects such as gating, feedback, shape&#8208;memory, or programming. In the absence of general and robust design and prediction strategies for their mechanical properties, at present, combined chemical and crystal engineering approaches could provide useful guidelines to identify effectors that determine both the magnitude and time of their response. Here, we capitalize on the purported ability of soft intermolecular interactions to instigate mechanical compliance by using halogenation to elicit both mechanical and photochemical activity of organic crystals. Starting from (E)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diphenylbut&#8208;2&#8208;ene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dione, whose crystals are brittle and photoinert, we use double and quadruple halogenation to introduce halogen&#8208;bonded planes that become interfaces for molecular gliding, rendering the material mechanically and photochemically plastic. Fluorination diversifies the mechanical effects further, and crystals of the tetrafluoro derivative are not only elastic but also motile, displaying the rare photosalient effect.

         <title>Operando Spectroscopic Monitoring of Metal Chalcogenides for Overall Water Splitting: New Views of Active Species and Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combined operando XAS and electrochemical characterizations unravel a divergent structural optimization of cobalt sulfide catalysts toward overall water splitting in different media. Our results highlight the crucial influence of in situ formed active species on the catalytic performance, and we show that these transient coordination environments are not evident from ex situ characterizations.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;based chalcogenides exhibit great promise for overall water splitting, yet their intrinsic catalytic reaction mechanisms remain to be fully understood. In this work, we employed operando X&#8208;ray absorption (XAS) and in situ Raman spectroscopy to elucidate the structure&#8211;activity relationships of low&#8208;crystalline cobalt sulfide (L&#8722;CoS) catalysts toward overall water splitting. The operando results for L&#8722;CoS catalyzing the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) demonstrate that the cobalt centers in the bulk are predominantly coordinated by sulfur atoms, which undergo a kinetic structural rearrangement to generate metallic cobalt in S&#8722;Co&#8722;Co&#8722;S moieties as the true catalytically active species. In comparison, during the acidic HER, L&#8722;CoS undergoes local structural optimization of Co centers, and H2 production proceeds with adsorption/desorption of key intermediates atop the Co&#8722;S&#8722;Co configurations. Further operando characterizations highlight the crucial formation of high&#8208;valent Co4+ species in L&#8722;CoS for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the formation of such active species was found to be far more facile than in crystalline Co3O4 and Co&#8208;LDH references. These insights offer a clear picture of the complexity of active species and site formation in different media, and demonstrate how their restructuring influences the catalytic activity.

         <title>Strategies for Achieving Ultra&#8208;Long ORR Durability&#8212;Rh Activates Interatomic Interactions in Alloys</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By modulating the interatomic interactions between the constituent atoms of the catalyst, a novel approach has been introduced to prevent the dissolution of transition metals, resulting in ultra&#8208;long durability in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Rh&#8722;Pt3Co/C catalysts demonstrate high activity and excellent durability with low platinum group metal (PGM) loading.







Abstract
The stability of platinum&#8208;based alloy catalysts is crucial for the future development of proton exchange membrane fuel cells, considering the potential dissolution of transition metals under complex operating conditions. Here, we report on a Rh&#8208;doped Pt3Co alloy that exhibits strong interatomic interactions, thereby enhancing the durability of fuel cells. The Rh&#8722;Pt3Co/C catalyst demonstrates exceptional catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) (1.31&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 at 0.9&#8197;V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and maintaining 92&#8201;% of its mass activity after 170,000 potential cycles). Long&#8208;term testing has shown direct inhibition of Co dissolution in Rh&#8722;Pt3Co/C. Furthermore, tests on proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) have shown excellent performance and long&#8208;term durability with low Pt loading. After 50,000&#8197;cycles, there was no voltage loss at 0.8&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for Rh&#8722;Pt3Co/C, while Pt3Co/C experienced a loss of 200&#8197;mV. Theoretical calculations suggest that introducing transition metal atoms through doping creates a stronger compressive strain, which in turn leads to increased catalytic activity. Additionally, Rh doping increases the energy barrier for Co diffusion in the bulk phase, while also raising the vacancy formation energy of the surface Pt. This ensures the long&#8208;term stability of the alloy over the course of the cycle.

         <title>Controllable Skeletal and Peripheral Editing of Pyrroles with Vinylcarbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly controllable molecular editing strategy of pyrroles was achieved by using trifluoromethyl vinyl N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones as vinylcarbene precursors, which led to the first dearomative single&#8208;atom skeletal editing of pyrroles through carbon&#8208;atom insertion, as well as three types of peripheral editing reactions: &#945;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;selective C&#8722;H insertion, and [3+2] cycloaddition.







Abstract
The skeletal editing of azaarenes through insertion, deletion, or swapping of single atoms has recently gained considerable momentum in chemical synthesis. Here, we describe a practical skeletal editing strategy using vinylcarbenes in situ generated from trifluoromethyl vinyl N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones, leading to the first dearomative skeletal editing of pyrroles through carbon&#8208;atom insertion. Furthermore, depending on the used catalyst and substrate, three types of peripheral editing reactions of pyrroles are also disclosed: &#945;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;selective C&#8722;H insertion, and [3+2] cycloaddition. These controllable molecular editing reactions provide a powerful platform for accessing medicinally relevant CF3&#8208;containing N&#8208;heterocyclic frameworks, such as 2,5&#8208;dihydropyridines, piperidines, azabicyclo[3.3.0]octadienes, and allylated pyrroles from readily available pyrroles. Mechanistic insights from experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations shed light on the origin of substrate&#8208; or catalyst&#8208;controlled chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity as well as the reaction mechanism.

         <dc:description>
We report a novel chemoselective dehydrogenative functionalization of cyclopropylamides enabled by cooperative photoredox and cobalt catalysis for forging the allylic N,O&#8208;acyl&#8208;acetal scaffolds in an environmental&#8208;friendly and atom&#8208;economic fashion. The starting materials were readily available and the transformation proceeded under extremely mild conditions with good functional group tolerance and broad scopes.







Abstract
We disclose herein a novel photoredox and cobalt co&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening/acceptorless dehydrogenative functionalization of mono&#8208;donor cyclopropanes. This sustainable and atom&#8208;economic approach allows the rapid assembly of a wide range of allylic N,O&#8208;acyl&#8208;acetal derivatives. The starting materials are readily available and the reaction features mild conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent functional group compatibility. The optimized conditions accommodate assorted cycloalkylamides and primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols, with applications in late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceutically relevant compounds, stimulating further utility in medicinal chemistry. Moreover, selective nucleophilic substitutions with various carbon nucleophiles were achieved in a one&#8208;pot fashion, offering a reliable avenue to access some cyclic and acyclic derivatives.

         <title>Breaking the Scaling Relationship in C&#8722;N Coupling via the Doping Effects for Efficient Urea Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>

We propose a strategy to break the scaling relationship of intermediate binding via the doping engineering, which minimizes the kinetic barrier of C&#8722;N coupling, thereby achieving excellent performance in urea electrosynthesis.







Abstract
Electrochemical C&#8722;N coupling reaction based on carbon dioxide and nitrate have been emerged as a new &#8220;green synthetic strategy&#8221; for the synthesis of urea, but the catalytic efficiency is seriously restricted by the inherent scaling relations of adsorption energies of the active sites, the improvement of catalytic activity is frequently accompanied by the decrease in selectivity. Herein, a doping engineering strategy was proposed to break the scaling relationship of intermediate binding and minimize the kinetic barrier of C&#8722;N coupling. A thus designed SrCo0.39Ru0.61O3&#8722;&#948; catalyst achieves a urea yield rate of 1522&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 and faradic efficiency of 34.1&#8201;% at &#8722;0.7&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. A series of characterizations revealed that Co doping not only induces lattice distortion but also creates rich oxygen vacancies (OV) in the SrRuO3. The oxygen vacancies weaken the adsorption of *CO and *NH2 intermediates on the Co and Ru sites respectively, and the strain effects over the Co&#8722;Ru dual sites promoting the occurrence of C&#8722;N coupling of the two monomers instead of selective hydrogenating to form by&#8208;products. This work presents an insight into molecular coupling reactions towards urea synthesis via the doping engineering on SrRuO3.

         <title>A 2D Acridine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Framework for Selective Detection and Efficient Extraction of Gold from Complex Aqueous&#8208;Based Matrices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D acridine&#8208;based covalent organic framework (TpDa&#8208;COF) was prepared for the selective detection and efficient capture of gold. Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the a&#8208;photoinduced electron transfer, selective coordination and reductive process of Au(III) to Au(0) are the possible sensing and adsorption mechanisms. Furthermore, TpDa&#8208;COF exhibits ultrahigh capture efficiency (&gt;96&#8201;%) for gold in real water environments including river water, seawater and CPU leaching solutions.







Abstract
Developing candidate materials which possess the ability of both selective detection and efficient capture of precious metal gold is highly desirable for environment and economy. However, most of reported materials only focus on single function, which seriously restricts their practical application as probes or adsorbents. Herein, a two dimensional (2D) acridine&#8208;based covalent organic framework (TpDa&#8208;COF) is prepared via the linkage of imine bonds for gold detection and adsorption. The synthesized COF can achieve both fluorescence and colorimetric dual sensing for Au3+ in a low concentration range (0.1&#8211;1.5&#8197;ppm) with the limit of detection (LOD) of 0.036&#8197;ppm. Impressively, the selectivity of TpDa&#8208;COF for the detection of Au3+ is admirable (Fe3+, Fe2+ and Cu2+ for negligible influence on its fluorescence). In addition, TpDa&#8208;COF exhibits ultrahigh adsorption capacity of 982.5&#8197;mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 for gold at pH=4, which is attributed the synergistic effect of both selective coordination and reductive process of Au(III) to Au(0). Meanwhile, both positive entropy change (&#916;S=76.07&#8197;J&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;K&#8722;1) and high distribution coefficient (Kd=12484.8&#8197;mL&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1) confirm the good affinity between TpDa&#8208;COF framework and gold. This work gives us a new insight to prepare COF with pyridine nitrogen sites for gold detection and adsorption.

         <title>Heteroatom Substitution Strategy Modulates Thermodynamics Towards Chemically Recyclable Polyesters and Monomeric Unit Sequence by Temperature Switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new monomer design strategy in the &#948;&#8208;valerolactone (VL) system, coined as heteroatom substitution strategy (HSS), is proposed for a) the synthesis of chemically recyclable polyesters, and b) the sequence control in copolyesters by temperature switching.







Abstract
In this paper, we proposed a heteroatom substitution strategy (HSS) in the &#948;&#8208;valerolactone (VL) system to modulate thermodynamics toward chemically recyclable polyesters. Three VL&#8208;based monomers containing different heteroatoms (M1 (N), M2 (S), and M3 (O)), instead of C&#8208;5 carbon, were designed and synthesized to verify our proposed HSS. All three monomers undergo organocatalytic living/controlled ROP and controllable depolymerization. Impressively, the resulting P(M1) achieved over 99&#8201;% monomer recovery under both mild solution depolymerization and high vacuum pyrolysis conditions without any side reactions, and the recycled monomers can be polymerized again forming new polymers. The systematic study of the relationship between heteroatom substitution and recyclability shows that introducing heteroatoms does change the thermodynamics of the monomers (&#916;Hpo, &#916;Spo and Tc values), thereby adjusting the polymerizability and depolymerizability. DFT calculations found that the introduction of heteroatoms adjusts the ring strain by changing the angular strain of the monomers, and the order of their angular strain (M2&gt;M1&gt;M3) is consistent with the order of the experimentally obtained enthalpy change. Notably, the one&#8208;pot/one&#8208;step copolymerization of two of each of the three monomers enables the synthesis of sequence&#8208;controlled copolymers from gradient to random to block structures, by simply switching the copolymerization temperature.

         <title>Layer&#8208;Controllable &#8220;2.5D&#8221; DNA Origami Crystals Synthesized by a Hierarchical Assembly Strategy</title>

A hierarchical assembly strategy for fabricating &#8220;2.5D&#8221; (2.5 dimensional) DNA origami crystals with customizable layer properties and achieve various 2.5D assemblies with different layer numbers, interlayer distances and surface morphologies.







Abstract
The finite periodic arrangement of functional nanomaterials on the two&#8208;dimensional scale enables the integration and enhancement of individual properties, making them an important research topic in the field of tuneable nanodevices. Although layer&#8208;controllable lattices such as graphene have been successfully synthesized, achieving similar control over colloidal nanoparticles remains a challenge. DNA origami technology has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in programmed nanoparticle assembly. Based on this technology, we proposed a hierarchical assembly strategy to construct a universal DNA origami platform with customized layer properties, which we called 2.5&#8208;dimensional (2.5D) DNA origami crystals. Methodologically, this strategy divides the assembly procedure into two steps: 1) array synthesis, and 2) lattice synthesis, which means that the layer properties, including layer number, interlayer distance, and surface morphology, can be flexibly customized based on the independent designs in each step. In practice, these synthesized 2.5D crystals not only pioneer the expansion of the DNA origami crystal library to a wider range of dimensions, but also highlight the technological potential for templating 2.5D colloidal nanomaterial lattices.

         <title>An Expanded Palette of Fluorescent COS/H2S&#8208;Releasing Donors for H2S Delivery, Detection, and In Vivo Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>

We report a palette of fluorescent turn&#8208;on COS/H2S donors that are based on a sulfenyl thiocarbonate scaffold. Reaction with thiols generates H2S and a fluorescent response that can be monitored in situ, in live cells, and in live rats.







Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an important reactive sulfur species that is involved in many biological functions, and H2S imbalances have been indicated as a potential biomarker for various diseases. Different H2S donors have been developed to deliver H2S directly to biological systems, but few reports include donors with optical responses that allow for tracking of H2S release. Moreover, donor systems that use the same chemistry to deliver H2S across a palette of fluorescent responses remain lacking. Here we report five thiol&#8208;activated fluorescence turn&#8208;on COS/H2S donors that utilize blue, yellow, orange, red, and near infrared&#8208;emitting dyes functionalized with an H2S&#8208;releasing sulfenyl thiocarbonate scaffold. Upon treatment with thiols, each donor provides a fluorescence turn&#8208;on response (3&#8211;310&#8208;fold) and high H2S release efficiencies (&gt;60&#8201;%). Using combined electrode and fluorescence experiments, we directly correlate the measured H2S release with the fluorescence response. All donors are biocompatible and release H2S in live cell environments. In addition, we demonstrate that the NIR donor allows for imaging H2S release in live rats via subcutaneous injection of the donor loaded into an alginate gel, which to the best of our knowledge is the first in vivo tracking of H2S release from a fluorogenic donor in non&#8208;transparent organisms.

         <title>A Stapled Peptide Inhibitor Targeting the Binding Interface of N6&#8208;Adenosine&#8208;Methyltransferase Subunits METTL3 and METTL14 for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a stapled peptide inhibitor, RSM3, of the N6&#8208;adenosine&#8208;methyltransferase subunit METTL3, discovered from the METTL3&#8211;METTL14 structure. This inhibitor induces METTL3 degradation and suppresses m6A mRNA methylation, differently from the mechanism of small molecule STM2457. RSM3 exhibits remarkable anticancer efficacy in a PC3 prostate cancer cell line xenograft tumor model, highlighting the potential of drug design targeting METTL3.







Abstract
METTL3, a primary methyltransferase catalyzing the RNA N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) modification, has been identified as an oncogene in several cancer types and thus nominated as a potentially effective target for therapeutic inhibition. However, current options using this strategy are limited. In this study, we targeted protein&#8211;protein interactions at the METTL3&#8211;METTL14 binding interface to inhibit complex formation and subsequent catalysis of the RNA m6A modification. Among candidate peptides, RM3 exhibited the highest anti&#8208;cancer potency, inhibiting METTL3 activity while also facilitating its proteasomal degradation. We then designed a stapled peptide inhibitor (RSM3) with enhanced peptide stability and formation of the &#945;&#8208;helical secondary structure required for METTL3 interaction. Functional and transcriptomic analysis in vivo indicated that RSM3 induced upregulation of programmed cell death&#8208;related genes while inhibiting cancer&#8208;promoting signals. Furthermore, tumor growth was significantly suppressed while apoptosis was enhanced upon RSM3 treatment, accompanied by increased METTL3 degradation, and reduced global RNA methylation levels in two in vivo tumor models. This peptide inhibitor thus exploits a mechanism distinct from other small&#8208;molecule competitive inhibitors to inhibit oncogenic METTL3 activity. Our findings collectively highlight the potential of targeting METTL3 in cancer therapies through peptide&#8208;based inhibition of complex formation and proteolytic degradation.

         <title>Functionalization of Supramolecular Polymers by Dynamic Covalent Boroxine Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boronic acid self&#8208;condensation provides ready access to boroxine&#8208;based, C3&#8208;symmetrical monomer architectures that can cooperatively assemble into helical supramolecular polymers. The dynamic boroxine scaffold enables fast intermolecular exchange of boronic acid between different monomers and facilitates the introduction of functionality into assembled structures by co&#8208;condensation with functional boronic acids.







Abstract
Molecular scaffolds that enable the combinatorial synthesis of new supramolecular building blocks are promising targets for the construction of functional molecular systems. Here, we report a supramolecular scaffold based on boroxine that enables the formation of chiral and ordered 1D supramolecular polymers, which can be easily functionalized for circularly polarized luminescence. The boroxine monomers are quantitatively synthesized in situ, both in bulk and in solution, from boronic acid precursors and cooperatively polymerize into 1D helical aggregates stabilized by threefold hydrogen&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. We then demonstrate amplification of asymmetry in the co&#8208;assembly of chiral/achiral monomers and the co&#8208;condensation of chiral/achiral precursors in classical and in situ sergeant&#8208;and&#8208;soldiers experiments, respectively, showing fast boronic acid exchange reactions occurring in the system. Remarkably, co&#8208;condensation of pyrene boronic acid with a hydrogen&#8208;bonding chiral boronic acid results in chiral pyrene aggregation with circularly polarized excimer emission and g&#8208;values in the order of 10&#8722;3. Yet, the electron deficiency of boron in boroxine makes them chemically addressable by nucleophiles, but also sensitive to hydrolysis. With this sensitivity in mind, we provide first insights into the prospects offered by boroxine&#8208;based supramolecular polymers to make chemically addressable, functional, and adaptive systems.

         <title>Overcoming Electrostatic Interaction via Pulsed Electroreduction for Boosting the Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling from carbon dioxide and nitrate is a sustainable and promising alternative for urea synthesis. We developed a stable CuSiOx catalyst with abundant atomic Cu&#8722;O&#8722;Si interfacial sites toward urea electrosynthesis, in which Cu species are uniformly dispersed in the silica matrix. Besides, we adopt pulsed electroreduction to overcome electrostatic interaction, promoting nitrate adsorption and reduction to urea.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic urea synthesis under ambient conditions offers a promising alternative strategy to the traditional energy&#8208;intensive urea industry protocol.

&lt;p&gt;The electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling from carbon dioxide and nitrate is a sustainable and promising alternative for urea synthesis. We developed a stable CuSiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst with abundant atomic Cu&#8722;O&#8722;Si interfacial sites toward urea electrosynthesis, in which Cu species are uniformly dispersed in the silica matrix. Besides, we adopt pulsed electroreduction to overcome electrostatic interaction, promoting nitrate adsorption and reduction to urea.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalytic urea synthesis under ambient conditions offers a promising alternative strategy to the traditional energy-intensive urea industry protocol. Limited by the electrostatic interaction, the reduction reaction of anions at the cathode in the electrocatalytic system is not easily achievable. Here, we propose a novel strategy to overcome electrostatic interaction via pulsed electroreduction.

         <title>Imidazole&#8208;Intercalated Cobalt Hydroxide Enabling the Li+ Desolvation/Diffusion Reaction and Flame Retardant Catalytic Dynamics for Lithium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of intercalated small organic molecules in the anode material was proposed to enhance the capacity and cycle stability of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The introduction of imidazole molecules provides more binding sites for lithium ions, which also can participate in the generation of SEI and maintain the stability of cobalt hydroxide structure. Moreover, the anode material has the function of smoke suppression and toxicity reduction when thermal runaway occurs, which can improve the thermal safety of lithium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries have found extensive applications due to their high energy density and low self&#8208;discharge rates, spanning from compact consumer electronics to large&#8208;scale energy storage facilities. Despite their widespread use, challenges such as inherent capacity degradation and the potential for thermal runaway hinder sustainable development. In this study, we introduce a unique approach to synthesize anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, specifically imidazole&#8208;intercalated cobalt hydroxide. This innovative material significantly enhances the Li+ desolvation/diffusion reaction and flame&#8208;retardant dynamics through complexing and catalytic synergetic effects. The lithium&#8208;ion batteries incorporating these materials demonstrate exceptional performance, boasting an impressive capacity retention of 997.91&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 500&#8197;cycles. This achievement can be attributed to the optimization of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) interface engineering, effectively mitigating anode degradation and minimizing electrolyte consumption. Experimental and theoretical calculations validate these improvements. Importantly, imidazole intercalated Co(OH)2 (MI&#8722;Co(OH)2) exhibits a remarkable catalytic effect on electrolyte carbonization and the conversion of CO to CO2. This dual action suppresses smoke and reduces toxicity significantly. The presented work introduces a novel approach to realizing high&#8208;performance and safe lithium&#8208;ion batteries, addressing key challenges in the pursuit of sustainable energy solutions.

This study introduces an innovative approach that combines high efficacy with safety through the synthesis of P(MAG&#8208;co&#8208;DMC) based micro&#8208;adjuvants. The utilization of metal&#8208;free surface&#8208;initiated atom transfer radical polymerization enables the production of safe and recyclable adjuvants. Additionally, the adjuvants exhibit a &#8220;micro&#8208;ligand&#8208;mediated maturation enhancement&#8221; effect for DC maturation.







Abstract
In the development of dendritic cell (DC) vaccines, the maturation of DCs is a critical stage. Adjuvants play a pivotal role in the maturation of DCs, with a major concern being to ensure both efficacy and safety. This study introduces an innovative approach that combines high efficacy with safety through the synthesis of micro&#8208;adjuvants grafted with copolymers of 2&#8208;(methacrylamido) glucopyranose (MAG) and methacryloxyethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (DMC). The utilization of metal&#8208;free surface&#8208;initiated atom transfer radical polymerization enables the production of safe and recyclable adjuvants. These micrometer&#8208;sized adjuvants surpass the optimal size range for cellular endocytosis, enabling the retrieval and reuse of them during the ex vivo maturation process, mitigating potential toxicity concerns associated with the endocytosis of non&#8208;metabolized nanoparticles. Additionally, the adjuvants exhibit a &#8220;micro&#8208;ligand&#8208;mediated maturation enhancement&#8221; effect for DC maturation. This effect is influenced by the shape of the particle, as evidenced by the distinct promotion effects of rod&#8208;like and spherical micro&#8208;adjuvants with comparable sizes. Furthermore, the porous structure of the adjuvants enables them to function as cargo&#8208;carrying &#8220;micro&#8208;shuttles&#8221;, releasing antigens upon binding to DCs to facilitate efficient antigen delivery.

         <title>Unlocking the Metalation Applications of TMP&#8208;powered Fe and Co(II) bis(amides): Synthesis, Structure and Mechanistic Insights</title>

Reversing the more usual trend of replicating transition metal chemistry with main group compounds, this work elaborates the applications of the new earth&#8208;abundant d&#8208;block amides Fe(TMP)2 and Co(TMP)2 in deprotonative metalation chemistry, a field dominated by highly polar s&#8208;block amides such as LiTMP and NaTMP (TMP=2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide).







Abstract
Typified by LiTMP and TMPMgCl.LiCl, (TMP=2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide), s&#8208;block metal amides have found widespread applications in arene deprotonative metalation. On the contrary, transition metal amides lack sufficient basicity to activate these substrates. Breaking new ground in this field, here we present the synthesis and full characterisation of earth&#8208;abundant transition metals M(TMP)2 (M=Fe, Co). Uncovering a new reactivity profile towards fluoroarenes, these amide complexes can promote direct M&#8722;H exchange processes regioselectively using one or two of their basic amide arms. Remarkably, even when using a perfluorinated substrate, selective C&#8208;H metalation occurs leaving C&#8722;F bonds intact. Their kinetic basicity can be boosted by LiCl or NBu4Cl additives which enables formation of kinetically activated ate species. Combining spectroscopic and structural studies with DFT calculations, mechanistic insights have been gained on how these low polarity metalation processes take place. M(TMP)2 can also be used to access ferrocene and cobaltocene by direct deprotonation of cyclopentadiene and undergo efficient CO2 insertion of both amide groups under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Acetobacter pasteurianus Lipid&#8201;A with a Unique Tetrasaccharide Backbone and Evaluation of Its Immunological Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lipid A contained in fermented foods is expected to be a safe immunostimulant. The first chemical synthesis of fermentative bacteria Acetobacter pasteurianus lipid&#8197;A, an immune component in black rice vinegar, was achieved via borinic acid catalyzed 1,1&#8217;&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;glycosylation. Furthermore, glucuronic acid residue, a unique structure of A.&#8197;pasteurianus lipid&#8197;A, was found to largely contribute to its immunological and acid&#8208;stable properties.







Abstract
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a cell surface component of Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, activates innate immunity. Its active principle is the terminal glycolipid lipid&#8197;A. Acetobacter pasteurianus is a Gram&#8208;negative bacterium used in the fermentation of traditional Japanese black rice vinegar (kurozu). In this study, we focused on A.&#8197;pasteurianus lipid&#8197;A, which is a potential immunostimulatory component of kurozu. The active principle structure of A.&#8197;pasteurianus lipid&#8197;A has not yet been identified. Herein, we first systematically synthesized three types of A.&#8197;pasteurianus lipid&#8197;As containing a common and unique tetrasaccharide backbone. We developed an efficient method for constructing the 2&#8208;trehalosamine skeleton utilizing borinic acid&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation to afford 1,1&#8217;&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;glycoside in high yield and stereoselectivity. A common tetrasaccharide intermediate with an orthogonal protecting group pattern was constructed via [2+2] glycosylation. After introducing various fatty acids, all protecting groups were removed to achieve the first chemical synthesis of three distinct types of A.&#8197;pasteurianus lipid&#8197;As. After evaluating their immunological function using both human and murine cell lines, we identified the active principles of A.&#8197;pasteurianus LPS.

     alt="Chemical Synthesis of Acetobacter pasteurianus Lipid&#8201;A with a Unique Tetrasaccharide Backbone and Evaluation of Its Immunological Functions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipid A contained in fermented foods is expected to be a safe immunostimulant. The first chemical synthesis of fermentative bacteria &lt;i&gt;Acetobacter pasteurianus&lt;/i&gt; lipid&#8197;A, an immune component in black rice vinegar, was achieved via borinic acid catalyzed 1,1&#8217;-&#945;,&#945;-glycosylation. Furthermore, glucuronic acid residue, a unique structure of &lt;i&gt;A.&#8197;pasteurianus&lt;/i&gt; lipid&#8197;A, was found to largely contribute to its immunological and acid-stable properties.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a cell surface component of Gram-negative bacteria, activates innate immunity. Its active principle is the terminal glycolipid lipid&#8197;A. &lt;i&gt;Acetobacter pasteurianus&lt;/i&gt; is a Gram-negative bacterium used in the fermentation of traditional Japanese black rice vinegar (kurozu). In this study, we focused on &lt;i&gt;A.&#8197;pasteurianus&lt;/i&gt; lipid&#8197;A, which is a potential immunostimulatory component of kurozu. The active principle structure of &lt;i&gt;A.&#8197;pasteurianus&lt;/i&gt; lipid&#8197;A has not yet been identified. Herein, we first systematically synthesized three types of &lt;i&gt;A.&#8197;pasteurianus&lt;/i&gt; lipid&#8197;As containing a common and unique tetrasaccharide backbone. We developed an efficient method for constructing the 2-trehalosamine skeleton utilizing borinic acid-catalyzed glycosylation to afford 1,1&#8217;-&#945;,&#945;-glycoside in high yield and stereoselectivity. A common tetrasaccharide intermediate with an orthogonal protecting group pattern was constructed via [2+2] glycosylation. After introducing various fatty acids, all protecting groups were removed to achieve the first chemical synthesis of three distinct types of &lt;i&gt;A.&#8197;pasteurianus&lt;/i&gt; lipid&#8197;As. After evaluating their immunological function using both human and murine cell lines, we identified the active principles of &lt;i&gt;A.&#8197;pasteurianus&lt;/i&gt; LPS. We also found the unique anomeric structure of &lt;i&gt;A.&#8197;pasteurianus&lt;/i&gt; lipid&#8197;A contributes to its high chemical stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Ion Anchor Induced Highly Reversible Zn Anodes for High Performance Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn&#8208;ion anchoring strategy was proposed to manipulate the coordination structure of solvated Zn&#8208;ions and guide the Zn&#8208;ion depositional behavior. Specifically, the amphoteric charged ion additives act as zinc&#8208;ion anchors, guiding the uniform zinc&#8208;ion distribution by using its positively charged groups. While the negatively charged groups reduces the active water molecules within solvation sheaths of Zn&#8208;ions, enabling AZMBs with high reversibility and extra&#8208;long lifespans.







Abstract
Unstable Zn interface with serious detrimental parasitic side&#8208;reactions and uncontrollable Zn dendrites severely plagues the practical application of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. The interface stability was closely related to the electrolyte configuration and Zn2+ depositional behavior. In this work, a unique Zn&#8208;ion anchoring strategy is originally proposed to manipulate the coordination structure of solvated Zn&#8208;ions and guide the Zn&#8208;ion depositional behavior. Specifically, the amphoteric charged ion additives (denoted as DM), which act as zinc&#8208;ion anchors, can tightly absorb on the Zn surface to guide the uniform zinc&#8208;ion distribution by using its positively charged &#8722;NR4+ groups. While the negatively charged &#8722;SO3&#8722; groups of DM on the other hand, reduces the active water molecules within solvation sheaths of Zn&#8208;ions. Benefiting from the special synergistic effect, Zn metal exhibits highly ordered and compact (002) Zn deposition and negligible side&#8208;reactions. As a result, the advanced Zn||Zn symmetric cell delivers extraordinarily 7000&#8197;hours long lifespan (0.25&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 0.25&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Additionally, based on this strategy, the NH4V4O10||Zn pouch&#8208;cell with low negative/positive capacity ratio (N/P ratio=2.98) maintains 80.4&#8201;% capacity retention for 180&#8197;cycles. A more practical 4&#8197;cm*4&#8197;cm sized pouch&#8208;cell could be steadily cycled in a high output capacity of 37.0&#8197;mAh over 50&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Cross&#8208;selective Deoxygenative Coupling of Aliphatic Alcohols: Installation of Methyl Groups including Isotopic Labels by Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling reaction provides, for the first time, a cross&#8208;selective reaction of two alcohols. Methanol, activated as methyl tosylate, undergoes XEC with a range of secondary alcohols activated as the corresponding mesylates. Catalyst turnover is achieved with a stoichiometric reducing metal or electrochemically. This transformation provides facile incorporation of isotopic labels, by deuteration of ketone intermediates and/or employing isotopically labelled methanol.







Abstract
Nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling reactions of two aliphatic alcohol derivatives remain a challenge. Herein, we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive methylation reaction of aliphatic mesylates with methyl tosylate. This reaction provides straightforward access to compounds bearing aliphatic methyl groups from alkyl alcohol derivatives. Isotopically labelled substrates and reagents can be employed in the reaction to provide perdeuterated and 13C&#8208;labelled products. This transformation can be achieved by employing stoichiometric Mn reductant or electrochemically. Additionally, mechanistic experiments show that alkyl iodides are key intermediates in the transformation which undergo a stereoablative reaction via radical intermediates.

         <title>Tensile Strain&#8208;Mediated Bimetallene Nanozyme for Enhanced Photothermal Tumor Catalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the first report on a novel tensile strain&#8208;mediated local amorphous RhRu (la&#8208;RhRu) bimetallene with exceptional intrinsic photothermal effect and photo&#8208;enhanced multiple enzyme&#8208;like activities. Functioning as a tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive nanozyme, la&#8208;RhRu exhibits remarkable therapeutic efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. This work highlights the tremendous potential of atomic&#8208;scale tensile strain engineering strategy in enhancing tumor catalytic therapy.







Abstract
Nanozymes have demonstrated significant potential in combating malignant tumor proliferation through catalytic therapy. However, the therapeutic effect is often limited by insufficient catalytic performance. In this study, we propose the utilization of strain engineering in metallenes to fully expose the active regions due to their ultrathin nature. Here, we present the first report on a novel tensile strain&#8208;mediated local amorphous RhRu (la&#8208;RhRu) bimetallene with exceptional intrinsic photothermal effect and photo&#8208;enhanced multiple enzyme&#8208;like activities. Through geometric phase analysis, electron diffraction profile, and X&#8208;ray diffraction, it is revealed that crystalline&#8208;amorphous heterophase boundaries can generate approximately 2&#8201;% tensile strain in the bimetallene. The ultrathin structure and in&#8208;plane strain of the bimetallene induce an amplified strain effect. Both experimental and theoretical evidence support the notion that tensile strain promotes multiple enzyme&#8208;like activities. Functioning as a tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive nanozyme, la&#8208;RhRu exhibits remarkable therapeutic efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. This work highlights the tremendous potential of atomic&#8208;scale tensile strain engineering strategy in enhancing tumor catalytic therapy.

         <title>Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly of Multidimensional Functional Materials from Sequence&#8208;Defined Peptoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The correlation between microscopic molecular structures of sequenced&#8208;defined peptoids and their resultant macroscopic assemblies was explored. By incorporating tetraphenylethylene and its derivative as functional groups at the termini of peptoid sequences, three&#8208;dimensional twisted bundles were evolved from discrete nanotubes or nanosheets, further enabling the creation of a highly efficient artificial light harvesting system.







Abstract
Hierarchical self&#8208;assembly represents a powerful strategy for the fabrication of functional materials across various length scales. However, achieving precise formation of functional hierarchical assemblies remains a significant challenge and requires a profound understanding of molecular assembly interactions. In this study, we present a molecular&#8208;level understanding of the hierarchical assembly of sequence&#8208;defined peptoids into multidimensional functional materials, including twisted nanotube bundles serving as a highly efficient artificial light harvesting system. By employing synchrotron&#8208;based powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and analyzing single crystal structures of model compounds, we elucidated the molecular packing and mechanisms underlying the assembly of peptoids into multidimensional nanostructures. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating aromatic functional groups, such as tetraphenyl ethylene (TPE), at the termini of assembling peptoid sequences promotes the formation of twisted bundles of nanotubes and nanosheets, thus enabling the creation of a highly efficient artificial light harvesting system. This research exemplifies the potential of leveraging sequence&#8208;defined synthetic polymers to translate microscopic molecular structures into macroscopic assemblies. It holds promise for the development of functional materials with precisely controlled hierarchical structures and designed functions.

         <title>Germaaluminocenes&#8212;Masked Heterofulvenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity pattern of germaaluminocenes is determined by the dichotomy of the electron&#8208;deficient aluminum atom and the electron&#8208;rich germanium center. The analysis of the product spectra obtained from the reaction with standard reagents reveals the role of these main group sandwich complexes as synthetic equivalents of otherwise not accessible aluminagermapentafulvenes.







Abstract
Germaaluminocenes are formed by salt metathesis reactions of dipotassium germacyclopentadienediides with pentamethylcyclopentadienylaluminum dichloride. The reactivity pattern of these sandwich complexes is determined by the electrophilic central aluminum atom and by the nucleophilic dicoordinated germanium center. Surprisingly, the products formed by reactions with Lewis acids, Lewis bases, amphiphiles and compounds with polar double bonds are those expected from the reaction of a hypothetical aluminagermapentafulvene with these types of reagents. This suggests that germaaluminocenes are synthetic equivalents to these pentafulvenes.

         <title>Revealing the Influence of Electron Migration Inside Polymer Electrolyte on Li+ Transport and Interphase Reconfiguration for Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>

In this work, La0.6Sr0.4CoO3&#8722;&#948; (LSC) enriched with high valence&#8208;state Co species and oxygen vacancies is developed as electronically conductive nanofillers embedded within ZnO/Zn3N2&#8208;functionalized polyimide nanofiber framework to establish Li+ transport highways for poly vinylene carbonate electrolyte and eliminate nonuniform Li deposits.







Abstract
The development of highly producible and interfacial compatible in situ polymerized electrolytes for solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) have been plagued by insufficient transport kinetics and uncontrollable dendrite propagation. Herein, we seek to explore a rationally designed nanofiber architecture to balance all the criteria of SSLMBs, in which La0.6Sr0.4CoO3&#8722;&#948; (LSC) enriched with high valence&#8208;state Co species and oxygen vacancies is developed as electronically conductive nanofillers embedded within ZnO/Zn3N2&#8208;functionalized polyimide (Zn&#8208;PI) nanofiber framework for the first time, to establish Li+ transport highways for poly vinylene carbonate (PVC) electrolyte and eliminate nonuniform Li deposits. Revealed by characterization and theoretical calculation under electric field, the positive&#8208;negative electrical dipole layer in LSC derived from electron migration between Co and O atoms aids in accelerating Li+ diffusion kinetics through densified electric field around filler particle, featuring a remarkable ionic conductivity of 1.50&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C and a high Li+ transference number of 0.91 without the risk of electron leakage. Integrating with the preferential sacrifice of ZnO/Zn3N2 on PI nanofiber upon immediate detection of dendritic Li, which takes part in reconfiguring hierarchical SEI chemistry dominated by LixNy/Li&#8722;Zn alloy inner layer and LiF outer layer, SSLMBs are further endowed with prolonged cycling lifespan and exceptional rate capability.

         <title>Oversaturating Liquid Interfaces with Nanoparticle&#8208;Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Explore the intriguing world of nanoparticle&#8208;surfactants at liquid interfaces. This study delves into how external electric fields can form and influence nanoparticle assemblies, leading to explosive emulsification behavior. It unveils a fascinating interplay between electrostatic forces and physiochemical conditions, offering a glimpse into the untapped possibilities of nanotechnology.







Abstract
Assemblies of nanoparticles at liquid interfaces hold promise as dynamic &#8220;active&#8221; systems when there are convenient methods to drive the system out of equilibrium via crowding. To this end, we show that oversaturated assemblies of charged nanoparticles can be realized and held in that state with an external electric field. Upon removal of the field, strong interparticle repulsive forces cause a high in&#8208;plane electrostatic pressure that is released in an explosive emulsification. We quantify the packing of the assembly as it is driven into the oversaturated state under an applied electric field. Physiochemical conditions substantially affect the intensity of the induced explosive emulsification, underscoring the crucial role of interparticle electrostatic repulsion.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Emission Beyond 900&#8197;nm from Stable Radicals in Nonconjugated Poly(diphenylmethane)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Full&#8208;spectrum emission, spanning from blue to near&#8208;infrared (beyond 900&#8197;nm), is attainable in poly(diphenylmethane) through adjustments in both concentration and excitation wavelength, which is attributed to the formation of stable radicals within the polymer and through&#8208;space conjugation. This study not only confirms the efficacy of polymerization in stabilizing radicals but also introduces a pioneering method for producing nonconjugated near&#8208;infrared emitters.







Abstract
Organic radicals with narrow energy gaps are highly sought&#8208;after for the production of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores. However, the current repertoire of developed organic radicals is notably limited, facing challenges related to stability and low fluorescence efficiency. This study addresses these limitations by achieving stable radicals in nonconjugated poly(diphenylmethane) (PDPM). Notably, PDPM exhibits a well&#8208;balanced structural flexibility and rigidity, resulting in a robust intra&#8208;/inter&#8208;chain through&#8208;space conjugation (TSC). The stable radicals within PDPM, coupled with strong TSC, yield a remarkable full&#8208;spectrum emission spanning from blue to NIR beyond 900&#8197;nm. This extensive tunability is achieved through careful adjustments of concentration and excitation wavelength. The findings highlight the efficacy of polymerization in stabilizing radicals and introduce a novel approach for developing nonconjugated NIR emitters based on triphenylmethane subunits.

         <title>On the Mechanisms of Hypohalous Acid Formation and Electrophilic Halogenation by Non&#8208;Native Halogenases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrophilic halogenases in nature are typically not efficient. Guided by flavin&#8208;dependent halogenase mechanisms and taking advantage of the versatile reactivity of a flavin hydroperoxide adduct and in situ generation of H2O2 by flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes, it was possible to promote the formation of a hypohalous acid&#8212;which is key for electrophilic halogenation&#8212;in various non&#8208;native halogenases by rerouting the flavin&#8208;generated peroxide.







Abstract
Enzymatic electrophilic halogenation is a mild tool for functionalization of diverse organic compounds. Only a few groups of native halogenases are capable of catalyzing such a reaction. In this study, we used a mechanism&#8208;guided strategy to discover the electrophilic halogenation activity catalyzed by non&#8208;native halogenases. As the ability to form a hypohalous acid (HOX) is key for halogenation, flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenases/oxidases capable of forming C4a&#8208;hydroperoxyflavin (FlC4a&#8208;OOH), such as dehalogenase, hydroxylases, luciferase and pyranose&#8208;2&#8208;oxidase (P2O), and flavin reductase capable of forming H2O2 were explored for their abilities to generate HOX in situ. Transient kinetic analyses using stopped&#8208;flow spectrophotometry/fluorometry and product analysis indicate that FlC4a&#8208;OOH in dehalogenases, selected hydroxylases and luciferases, but not in P2O can form HOX; however, the HOX generated from FlC4a&#8208;OOH cannot halogenate their substrates. Remarkably, in situ H2O2 generated by P2O can form HOI and also iodinate various compounds. Because not all enzymes capable of forming FlC4a&#8208;OOH can react with halides to form HOX, QM/MM calculations, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis and structural analysis were carried out to elucidate the mechanism underlying HOX formation and characterize the active site environment. Our findings shed light on identifying new halogenase scaffolds besides the currently known enzymes and have invoked a new mode of chemoenzymatic halogenation.

Guided by flavin-dependent halogenase mechanisms and taking advantage of the versatile reactivity of a flavin hydroperoxide adduct and in situ generation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by flavin-dependent enzymes, it was possible to promote the formation of a hypohalous acid&#8212;which is key for electrophilic halogenation&#8212;in various non-native halogenases by rerouting the flavin-generated peroxide.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enzymatic electrophilic halogenation is a mild tool for functionalization of diverse organic compounds. Only a few groups of native halogenases are capable of catalyzing such a reaction. In this study, we used a mechanism-guided strategy to discover the electrophilic halogenation activity catalyzed by non-native halogenases. As the ability to form a hypohalous acid (HOX) is key for halogenation, flavin-dependent monooxygenases/oxidases capable of forming C4a-hydroperoxyflavin (Fl&lt;sub&gt;C4a-OOH&lt;/sub&gt;), such as dehalogenase, hydroxylases, luciferase and pyranose-2-oxidase (P2O), and flavin reductase capable of forming H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; were explored for their abilities to generate HOX in situ. Transient kinetic analyses using stopped-flow spectrophotometry/fluorometry and product analysis indicate that Fl&lt;sub&gt;C4a-OOH&lt;/sub&gt; in dehalogenases, selected hydroxylases and luciferases, but not in P2O can form HOX; however, the HOX generated from Fl&lt;sub&gt;C4a-OOH&lt;/sub&gt; cannot halogenate their substrates. Remarkably, in situ H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generated by P2O can form HOI and also iodinate various compounds. Because not all enzymes capable of forming Fl&lt;sub&gt;C4a-OOH&lt;/sub&gt; can react with halides to form HOX, QM/MM calculations, site-directed mutagenesis and structural analysis were carried out to elucidate the mechanism underlying HOX formation and characterize the active site environment. Our findings shed light on identifying new halogenase scaffolds besides the currently known enzymes and have invoked a new mode of chemoenzymatic halogenation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Tandem Nitrate and CO2 Reduction for Urea Electrosynthesis: Role of Surface N&#8208;Intermediates in CO2 Capture and Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic coupling reaction of carbon dioxide and nitrate serves as a sustainable strategy for urea synthesis under ambient conditions. Herein we proposed a urea generation pathway via the tandem reduction of nitrate and CO2, in which the critical C&#8722;N coupling is achieved by the interaction between the nitrate reduction intermediate of *NH2 and free CO2.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of CO2 and nitrate offers a promising avenue to produce valuable chemicals through the using of greenhouse gas and nitrogen&#8208;containing wastewater. However, the generally proposed reaction pathway of concurrent CO2 and nitrate reduction for urea synthesis requires the catalysts to be both efficient in both CO2 and nitrate reduction, thus narrowing the selection range of suitable catalysts. Herein, we demonstrate a distinct mechanism in urea synthesis, a tandem NO3&#8722; and CO2 reduction, in which the surface amino species generated by nitrate reduction play the role to capture free CO2 and subsequent initiate its activation. When using the TiO2 electrocatalyst derived from MIL&#8208;125&#8208;NH2, it intrinsically exhibits low activity in aqueous CO2 reduction, however, in the presence of both nitrate and CO2, this catalyst achieves an excellent urea yield rate of 43.37&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 48.88&#8201;% at &#8722;0.9&#8197;V vs. RHE in a flow cell. Even at a low CO2 level of 15&#8201;%, the Faradaic efficiency of urea synthesis remains robust at 42.33&#8201;%. The tandem reduction procedure was further confirmed by in situ spectroscopies and theoretical calculations. This research provides new insights into the selection and design of electrocatalysts for urea synthesis.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered and Self&#8208;Recoverable Multimodal Force Sensors Based on Trap State and Interfacial Electron Transfer</title>

Multimodal force sensor: A self&#8208;powered and self&#8208;recoverable force sensor based on trap&#8208;controlled luminescence and interfacial electron transfer is presented. The magnitude of force can be converted into electrical responses, and force distribution can be visualized by optical signals simultaneously, without any power supply and high&#8208;energy irradiation. It has promising applications in a wide range of artificial intelligence systems.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;dimensional force sensing that combines intensity, location, area and the like could gather a wealth of information from mechanical stimuli. Developing materials with force&#8208;induced optical and electrical dual responses would provide unique opportunities to multi&#8208;dimensional force sensing, with electrical signals quantifying the force amplitude and the luminescence output providing spatial distribution of force. However, the reliance on external power supply and high&#8208;energy excitation source brings significant challenges to the applicability of multi&#8208;dimensional force sensors. Here we reported the mechanical energy&#8208;driven and sunlight&#8208;activated materials with force&#8208;induced dual responses, and investigated the underlying mechanisms of self&#8208;sustainable force sensing. Theoretical analysis and experimental data unraveled that trap&#8208;controlled luminescence and interfacial electron transfer play a major role in force&#8208;induced optical and electrical output. These materials were manufactured into pressure sensor with renewable dual&#8208;mode output for quantifying and visualization of pressures by electrical and optical output, respectively, without power supply and high&#8208;energy irradiation. The quantification of tactile sensation and stimuli localization of mice highlighted the multi&#8208;dimensional sensing ability of the sensor. Overall, this self&#8208;powered pressure sensor with multimodal output provides more modalities of force sensing, poised to change the way that intelligent devices sense with the world.

         <title>Achieving Near&#8208;Unity Red Light Photoluminescence in Antimony Halide Crystals via Polyhedron Regulation</title>

Three (TMS)2SbCl5 crystals have been prepared with diverse [SbCl5]2&#8722; configurations and distinct emission color (i.e., red, orange, and yellow) through solvent engineering. It is found that higher coordination symmetry and longer Sb&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Sb distance are in favor of the larger Stokes shift and lower energy emission. This work sheds insights into the structure&#8208;photoluminescence relationship towards development of highly efficient optoelectronic materials.







Abstract
Exploration of efficient red emitting antimony hybrid halide with large Stokes shift and zero self&#8208;absorption is highly desirable due to its enormous potential for applications in solid light emitting, and active optical waveguides. However, it is still challenging and rarely reported. Herein, a series of (TMS)2SbCl5 (TMS=triphenylsulfonium cation) crystals have been prepared with diverse [SbCl5]2&#8722; configurations and distinctive emission color. Among them, cubic&#8208;phase (TMS)2SbCl5 shows bright red emission with a large Stokes shift of 312&#8197;nm. In contrast, monoclinic and orthorhombic (TMS)2SbCl5 crystals deliver efficient yellow and orange emission, respectively. Comprehensive structural investigations reveal that larger Stokes shift and longer&#8208;wavelength emission of cubic (TMS)2SbCl5 can be attributed to the larger lattice volume and longer Sb&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Sb distance, which favor sufficient structural aberration freedom at excited states. Together with robust stability, (TMS)2SbCl5 crystal family has been applied as optical waveguide with ultralow loss coefficient of 3.67&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;4&#8197;dB&#8201;&#956;m&#8722;1, and shows superior performance in white&#8208;light emission and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. In short, our study provides a novel and fundamental perspective to structure&#8208;property&#8208;application relationship of antimony hybrid halides, which will contribute to future rational design of high&#8208;performance emissive metal halides.

         <title>A Nonlinear Photochromic Reaction Based on Sensitizer&#8208;Free Triplet&#8211;Triplet Annihilation in a Perylene&#8208;Substituted Rhodamine Spirolactam</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nonlinear photochromic reaction has been achieved in a perylene&#8208;substituted rhodamine spirolactam, which is easily synthesized from rhodamine B. Direct excitation with UV or blue light causes charge transfer and intersystem crossing, followed by triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation without triplet sensitizers to cause nonlinear behavior. In addition, using sensitizers enables the extension of the photoresponsivity from the blue to red region.







Abstract
Nonlinear photochromic reactions that work with weak incoherent light are important for molecular operations with high spatial resolution and multiple photofunctions based on single molecules. However, nonlinear photochromic compounds generally require complex molecular design, restricting accessibility in various fields. Herein, we report nonlinear photochromic properties in a perylene&#8208;substituted rhodamine spirolactam derivative (Rh&#8722;Pe), which is synthesized from rhodamine B in facile procedures. Direct excitation of Rh&#8722;Pe produces the triplet excited state via the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state. The triplet excited state causes triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation to bring the generation of the intensely colored ring&#8208;open form with nonlinear behavior. Furthermore, green&#8208; and red&#8208;light&#8208;induced photochromism was achieved in Rh&#8722;Pe using triplet sensitizers, although Rh&#8722;Pe can be directly excited only by ultraviolet and blue light.

     alt="A Nonlinear Photochromic Reaction Based on Sensitizer-Free Triplet&#8211;Triplet Annihilation in a Perylene-Substituted Rhodamine Spirolactam"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nonlinear photochromic reaction has been achieved in a perylene-substituted rhodamine spirolactam, which is easily synthesized from rhodamine B. Direct excitation with UV or blue light causes charge transfer and intersystem crossing, followed by triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation without triplet sensitizers to cause nonlinear behavior. In addition, using sensitizers enables the extension of the photoresponsivity from the blue to red region.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonlinear photochromic reactions that work with weak incoherent light are important for molecular operations with high spatial resolution and multiple photofunctions based on single molecules. However, nonlinear photochromic compounds generally require complex molecular design, restricting accessibility in various fields. Herein, we report nonlinear photochromic properties in a perylene-substituted rhodamine spirolactam derivative (Rh&#8722;Pe), which is synthesized from rhodamine B in facile procedures. Direct excitation of Rh&#8722;Pe produces the triplet excited state via the charge-transfer (CT) state. The triplet excited state causes triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation to bring the generation of the intensely colored ring-open form with nonlinear behavior. Furthermore, green- and red-light-induced photochromism was achieved in Rh&#8722;Pe using triplet sensitizers, although Rh&#8722;Pe can be directly excited only by ultraviolet and blue light. Our findings are expected to contribute to the development of photofunctional materials showing nonlinear behavior and low-energy light responsivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Gas&#8208;Induced Electrical and Magnetic Modulation of Two&#8208;Dimensional Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exposure to gaseous molecules can induce characteristic electrical and magnetic property changes of a semiconductive metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). The underlying interaction mechanism responsible for the electrical and magnetic modulation is found related to the intrinsic physical and chemical properties of the participating molecules which cause specific electronic and structural changes of the MOF.







Abstract
Controlled modulation of electronic and magnetic properties in stimuli&#8208;responsive materials provides valuable insights for the design of magnetoelectric or multiferroic devices. This paper demonstrates the modulation of electrical and magnetic properties of a semiconductive, paramagnetic metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF) Cu3(C6O6)2 with small gaseous molecules, NH3, H2S, and NO. This study merges chemiresistive and magnetic tests to reveal that the MOF undergoes simultaneous changes in electrical conductance and magnetization that are uniquely modulated by each gas. The features of response, including direction, magnitude, and kinetics, are modulated by the physicochemical properties of the gaseous molecules. This study advances the design of multifunctional materials capable of undergoing simultaneous changes in electrical and magnetic properties in response to chemical stimuli.

         <title>Silica Confinement for Stable and Magnetic Co&#8722;Cu Alloy Nanoparticles in Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon for Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile yet effective spatial confinement strategy is proposed to construct high&#8208;efficiency catalysts through carbonizing a mesoporous silica&#8208;confined Co&#8722;Cu bimetal&#8211;organic framework for hydrogen evolution from AB hydrolysis. The optimized Co0.8Cu0.2@NC@mSiO2 catalyst exhibits superior activity, outstanding stability, and magnetic recyclability for hydrogen evolution from AB hydrolysis under extremely mild conditions.







Abstract
Ammonia borane (AB) with 19.6&#8197;wt&#8201;% H2 content is widely considered a safe and efficient medium for H2 storage and release. Co&#8208;based nanocatalysts present strong contenders for replacing precious metal&#8208;based catalysts in AB hydrolysis due to their high activity and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, precisely adjusting the active centers and surface properties of Co&#8208;based nanomaterials to enhance their activity, as well as suppressing the migration and loss of metal atoms to improve their stability, presents many challenges. In this study, mesoporous&#8208;silica&#8208;confined bimetallic Co&#8722;Cu nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (CoxCu1&#8722;x@NC@mSiO2) were synthesized using a facile mSiO2&#8208;confined thermal pyrolysis strategy. The obtained product, an optimized Co0.8Cu0.2@NC@mSiO2 catalyst, exhibits enhanced performance with a turnover frequency of 240.9&#8197;molH2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;molmetal&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;min&#8722;1 for AB hydrolysis at 298&#8197;K, surpassing most noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalysts. Moreover, Co0.8Cu0.2@NC@mSiO2 demonstrates magnetic recyclability and extraordinary stability, with a negligible decline of only 0.8&#8201;% over 30&#8197;cycles of use. This enhanced performance was attributed to the synergistic effect between Co and Cu, as well as silica confinement. This work proposes a promising method for constructing noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalysts for AB hydrolysis.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Complementary Multicomponent Assembly of Low&#8208;Symmetry Co(III)Salphen&#8208;Based Coordination Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable, low&#8208;symmetry cages can be assembled by completing the octahedral coordination spheres of dinuclear Co(III)salphen macrocycles with shape&#8208;complementary bis&#8208;pyridyl bridges, starting from labile Co(II) precursors under aerobic conditions.







Abstract
While metal&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly is a popular technique to construct discrete nanosized objects, highly symmetric structures, built from one type of ligand at a time, are dominating reported systems. The tailored integration of a set of different ligands requires sophisticated approaches to avoid narcissistic separation or formation of statistical mixtures. Here, we demonstrate how the combination of three structure&#8208;guiding effects (metal&#8208;templated macrocyclization, additional bridging ligands and shape&#8208;complementarity) based on Co(III)salphen metal nodes allows for a rational and high&#8208;yielding synthesis of structurally complex, lantern&#8208;shaped cages with up to four differentiable bridges. Three new heteroleptic coordination cages based on dinuclear Co(III)salphen macrocycles were synthesized in a one&#8208;pot reaction approach and fully characterized, including single crystal X&#8208;ray analyses. One cage groups two of the same ligands, another two different ligands around a symmetric Co2&#8208;bis&#8208;salphen ring. In the most complex structure, this ring is unsymmetric, rendering all four connections between the two metal centers distinguishable. While heteroleptic assembly around Pd(II) nodes has been shown to be dynamic, beneficial for cage&#8208;to&#8208;cage transformations, assembly cascades and adaptive systems, the herein introduced cages based on kinetically more inert Co(III)salphen will be advantageous for applications in enzyme&#8208;like catalysis and molecular machinery that require enhanced structural and chemical stability.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Responsive Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Molecular Networks Capable of Retaining Crystalline Periodicity after Isomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochromic hydrogen&#8208;bonded network that retains crystalline periodicity after photo&#8208;isomerization was constructed using a tetracarboxylic acid derivative with a dihydrodimethylbenzo[e]pyrene core.







Abstract
The molecular conformation, crystalline morphology, and properties of photochromic organic crystals can be controlled through photoirradiation, making them promising candidates for functional organic materials. However, photochromic porous molecular crystals with a networked framework structure are rare due to the difficulty in maintaining space that allows for photo&#8208;induced molecular motion in the crystalline state. This study describes a photo&#8208;responsive single crystal based on hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) network of dihydrodimethylbenzo[e]pyrene derivative 4BDHP. A crystal composed of H&#8208;bonded undulate layers, 4BDHP&#8208;2, underwent photo&#8208;isomerization in the crystalline state due to loose stacking of the layers. Particularly, enantio&#8208;pure crystal (S,S)&#8208;4BDHP&#8208;2 allowed to reveal the structure of the photoisomerized crystal, in which the closed form (4BDHP) and open form (4CPD) were arranged alternately with keeping crystalline periodicity, although side reactions were also implied. The present proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept system of a photochromic framework that retains crystalline periodicity after photo&#8208;isomerization may provide new light&#8208;driven porous functional materials.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free Catalytic C&#8722;H Zincation and Alumination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition metal free catalytic C&#8722;H zincation and C&#8722;H alumination of heteroarenes using (&#946;&#8208;diketiminate)&#8208;metal complexes, where the only by&#8208;products are H2 or CH4, is reported. This is achieved by coupling endergonic C&#8722;H metalation with subsequent exergonic dehydrocoupling, with the latter process proceeding by metal&#8208;specific pathways.







Abstract
C&#8722;H metalation is the most efficient method to prepare aryl&#8211;zinc and &#8211;aluminium complexes that are ubiquitous nucleophiles. Virtually all C&#8722;H metalation routes to form Al/Zn organometallics require stoichiometric, strong Br&#248;nsted bases with no base&#8208;catalyzed reactions reported. Herein we present a catalytic in amine/ammonium salt (Et3N/[(Et3N)H]+) C&#8722;H metalation process to form aryl&#8208;zinc and aryl&#8208;aluminium complexes. Key to this approach is coupling an endergonic C&#8722;H metalation step with a sufficiently exergonic dehydrocoupling step between the ammonium salt by&#8208;product of C&#8722;H metalation ([(Et3N)H]+) and a Zn&#8722;H or Al&#8722;Me containing complex. This step, forming H2/MeH, makes the overall cycle exergonic while generating more of the reactive metal electrophile. Mechanistic studies supported by DFT calculations revealed metal&#8208;specific dehydrocoupling pathways, with the divergent reactivity due to the different metal valency (which impacts the accessibility of amine&#8208;free cationic metal complexes) and steric environment. Notably, dehydrocoupling in the zinc system proceeds through a ligand&#8208;mediated pathway involving protonation of the &#946;&#8208;diketiminate C&#947; position. Given this process is applicable to two disparate metals (Zn and Al), other main group metals and ligand sets are expected to be amenable to this transition metal&#8208;free, catalytic C&#8722;H metalation.

         <title>Recycling Valuable Alkylbenzenes from Polystyrene through Methanol&#8208;Assisted Depolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A methanol&#8208;assisted depolymerization of PS (PS&#8208;MAD) process was developed for effectively converting PS into value&#8208;added alkylbenzenes. Methanol is regarded as a hydrogen carrier decomposed in situ to provide moderate pressure of hydrogen which prevents benzene rings hydrogenation and promotes the depolymerization of PS. PS&#8208;MAD achieved a high yield of liquid products which accounted for 93.2&#8197;wt&#8201;% of virgin PS over Ru/SiO2 at 280&#8201;&#176;C for 6&#8197;h.







Abstract
The vast bulk of polystyrene (PS), a major type of plastic polymers, ends up in landfills, which takes up to thousands of years to decompose in nature. Chemical recycling promises to enable lower&#8208;energy pathways and minimal environmental impacts compared with traditional incineration and mechanical recycling. Herein, we demonstrated that methanol as a hydrogen supplier assisted the depolymerization of PS (denoted as PS&#8208;MAD) into alkylbenzenes over a heterogeneous catalyst composed of Ru nanoparticles on SiO2. PS&#8208;MAD achieved a high yield of liquid products which accounted for 93.2&#8197;wt&#8201;% of virgin PS at 280&#8201;&#176;C for 6&#8197;h with the production rate of 118.1&#8197;mmolcarbon&#8201;gcatal.&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. The major components were valuable alkylbenzenes (monocyclic aromatics and diphenyl alkanes), the sum of which occupied 84.3&#8197;wt&#8201;% of liquid products. According to mechanistic studies, methanol decomposition dominates the hydrogen supply during PS&#8208;MAD, thereby restraining PS aromatization which generates by&#8208;products of fused polycyclic arenes and polyphenylenes.

         <title>Organic Donor&#8211;Acceptor Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Photocatalysts in the Photoinduced Dehalogenation of Aryl Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of donor&#8208;acceptor thermally activated delayed fluorescence compounds based on DMAC&#8208;TRZ and containing aryl subtituents on the DMAC donor have been applied as photocatalysts in the dehalogenation of aryl halides having Ered up to &#8722;2.72&#8197;V vs SCE. Mechanistic studies indicate that these DMAC&#8208;TRZ based compounds act as pre&#8208;photocatalysts and photodegrade under the reaction conditions, with the photodecomposition product responsible for the photocatalysis.







Abstract
We report a family of donor&#8208;acceptor thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) compounds based on derivatives of DMAC&#8208;TRZ, that are strongly photoreducing. Both Eox and thus E*ox could be tuned via substitution of the DMAC donor with a Hammett series of p&#8208;substituted phenyl moieties while Ered remained effectively constant. These compounds were assessed in the photoinduced dehalogenation of aryl halides, and analogues bearing electron withdrawing groups were found to produce the highest yields. Substrates of up to Ered=&#8722;2.72&#8197;V could be dehalogenated at low PC loading (1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) and under air, conditions much milder than previously reported for this reaction. Spectroscopic and chemical studies demonstrate that all PCs, including literature reference PCs, photodegrade, and that it is these photodegradation products that are responsible for the reactivity.

         <title>Synthesis of ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite Nanosheets with Tunable Silanol Nest Contents across an Ultra&#8208;wide pH Range and Their Catalytic Validation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a method for synthesizing ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite nanosheets via aggregation crystallization of zeolite subcrystals within a broad pH range, detailing its crystallization process. pH manipulation enables precise control of silanol nest content, opening new avenues in zeolite engineering. Catalytic results in furfuryl alcohol etherification highlight the positive impact of regulating silanol nest content on catalytic reactions.







Abstract
Zeolite synthesis under acidic conditions has always presented a challenge. In this study, we successfully prepared series of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite nanosheets (Z&#8208;5&#8208;SCA&#8208;X) over a broad pH range (4 to 13) without the need for additional supplements. This achievement was realized through aggregation crystallization of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite subcrystal (Z&#8208;5&#8208;SC) with highly short&#8208;range ordering and ultrasmall size extracted from the synthetic system of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite. Furthermore, the crystallization behavior of Z&#8208;5&#8208;SC was investigated, revealing its non&#8208;classical crystallization process under mildly alkaline and acidic conditions (pH&lt;10), and the combination of classical and non&#8208;classical processes under strongly alkaline conditions (pH&#8805;10). What's particularly intriguing is that, the silanol nest content in the resultant Z&#8208;5&#8208;SCA&#8208;X samples appears to be dependent on the pH values during the Z&#8208;5&#8208;SC crystallization process rather than its crystallinity. Finally, the results of the furfuryl alcohol etherification reaction demonstrate that reducing the concentration of silanol nests significantly enhances the catalytic performance of the Z&#8208;5&#8208;SCA&#8208;X zeolite. The ability to synthesize zeolite in neutral and acidic environments without the additional mineralizing agents not only broadens the current view of traditional zeolite synthesis but also provides a new approach to control the silanol nest content of zeolite catalysts.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Responsive Colorimetric and Fluorometric Red&#8208;Shift in Triarylborane Derivatives: Dual Role of Phenazaborine as Lewis Acid and Electron Donor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of modulating photophysical properties by balancing the contradictory role of phenazaborine as a Lewis acid and an electron donor has been used to synthesize anion&#8208;responsive triarylborane compounds that displayed significant red&#8208;shift in their absorption and photoluminescence spectra in solution. This approach has also been successfully applied to modulate the emission color in polymer films.







Abstract
Photophysical modulation of triarylboranes (TABs) through Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions is a fundamental approach for sensing anions. Yet, design principles for anion&#8208;responsive TABs displaying significant red&#8208;shift in absorption and photoluminescence (PL) have remained elusive. Herein, a new strategy for modulating the photophysical properties of TABs in a red&#8208;shift mode has been presented, by using a nitrogen&#8208;bridged triarylborane (1,4&#8208;phenazaborine: PAzB) with a contradictory dual role as a Lewis acid and an electron donor. Following the strategy, PAzB derivatives connected with an electron&#8208;deficient azaaromatic have been developed, and these compounds display a distinct red&#8208;shift in their absorption and PL in response to an anion. Spectroscopic analyses and quantum chemical calculations have revealed the formation of a tetracoordinate borate upon the addition of fluoride, narrowing the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap and enhancing the charge&#8208;transfer character in the excited state. This approach has also been demonstrated in modulating the photophysical properties of solid&#8208;state films.

         <title>Preserving Mesoporosity in Type III Porous Liquids through Dual&#8208;layer Surface Weaving</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reported a dual&#8208;layer surface weaving strategy on metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) to realize Type III porous liquids (PLs) with apertures larger than the solvent molecules. The 1st polymer layer, cross&#8208;linked poly (t&#8208;butyl methacrylate), serves as a physical barrier to block the solvent molecules from entering the MOF pore. The 2nd layer uses a solvent&#8208;compatible polymer to reduce PL viscosity. As a result, a PL bearing a 3.1&#8197;nm aperture was successfully constructed.







Abstract
The fundamental limitation for pore preservation in a Type III porous liquid (T3PL) is the need for a small aperture from the porous filler to realize size exclusion of a bulky solvent. We present a dual&#8208;layer surface weaving strategy that can disregard this limitation and achieve micro&#8208; and mesoporous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based T3PLs even with apertures much larger than the solvent molecules. By first weaving a tight network of poly(tert&#8208;butyl methacrylate) on the MOF surface, the poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) solvent can be effectively excluded from the pores while smaller guest molecules such as CO2, C2H4, and H2O can freely access the interior, as confirmed by low&#8208;pressure adsorption isotherms. Further application of a PDMS&#8208;containing polymer coating helps lower the viscosity of the PL due to increased particle dispersibility. This strategy has resulted in the successful construction of T3PLs with aperture sizes up to 3.1&#8197;nm.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence Induced by Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Networks in a One&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Manganese(II) Chloride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new one&#8208;dimensional (1D) hybrid chiral manganese chloride with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), and high&#8208;thermal stability is presented. It is extremely promising for applications in red circularly polarized light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;LED) and X&#8208;ray imaging.







Abstract
Chiral hybrid metal halides hold great potential as circularly polarized luminescence light sources. Herein, we have obtained two enantiomeric pairs of one&#8208;dimensional hybrid chiral manganese(II) chloride single crystals, R/S&#8208;(3&#8208;methyl piperidine)MnCl3 (R/S&#8208;1) and R/S&#8208;(3&#8208;hydroxy piperidine)MnCl3 (R/S&#8208;2), crystallizing in the non&#8208;centrosymmetric space group P212121. In comparison to R/S&#8208;1, R/S&#8208;2 single crystals not only show red emission with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and high resistance to thermal quenching but also exhibit circularly polarized luminescence with an asymmetry factor (glum) of 2.5&#215;10&#8722;3, which can be attributed to the enhanced crystal rigidity resulting from the hydrogen bonding networks between R/S&#8208;(3&#8208;hydroxy piperidine) cations and [MnCl6]4&#8722; chains. The circularly polarized luminescence activities originate from the asymmetric [MnCl6]4&#8722; luminophores induced by N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cl hydrogen bonding with R/S&#8208;(3&#8208;hydroxy piperidine). Moreover, these samples demonstrate great application potential in circularly polarized light&#8208;emitting diodes and X&#8208;ray scintillators. This work shows a highly efficient photoluminescent Mn&#8208;based halide and offers a strategy for designing multifunctional chiral metal halides.

         <title>Water&#8208;Ice Microstructures and Hydration States of Acridinium Iodide Studied by Phosphorescence Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphorescence spectroscopy was utilized to visualize the microstructure transition of water at varying temperatures from 298&#8197;K to 77&#8197;K at a probe concentration of ~10&#8722;5&#8197;M, showing higher sensitivity by at least two orders of magnitude than absorption&#8208;base techniques. By this unique means, it was found that a trace amount (as low as 10&#8722;5&#8197;M) of organic hydrophiles could thoroughly prevent the crystallization of water ice at freezing temperatures.







Abstract
Ice has been suggested to have played a significant role in the origin of life partly owing to its ability to concentrate organic molecules and promote reaction efficiency. However, the techniques for studying organic molecules in ice are absorption&#8208;based, which limits the sensitivity of measurements. Here we introduce an emission&#8208;based method to study organic molecules in water ice: the phosphorescence displays high sensitivity depending on the hydration state of an organic salt probe, acridinium iodide (ADI). The designed ADI aqueous system exhibits phosphorescence that can be severely perturbed when the temperature is higher than 110&#8197;K at a concentration of the order of 10&#8722;5&#8197;M, indicating changes in hydration for ADI. Using the ADI phosphorescent probe, it is found that the microstructures of water ice, i.e., crystalline vs. glassy, can be strongly dictated by a trace amount (as low as 10&#8722;5&#8197;M) of water&#8208;soluble organic molecules. Consistent with cryoSEM images and temperature&#8208;dependent Raman spectral data, the ADI is dehydrated in more crystalline ice and hydrated in more glassy ice. The current investigation serves as a starting point for using more sensitive spectroscopic techniques for studying water&#8208;organics interactions at a much lower concentration and wider temperature range.

         <title>Synergistic Al&#8722;Al Dual&#8208;Atomic Site for Efficient Artificial Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;metal bonded dual&#8208;atomic Al&#8722;Al site was designed and synthesized on a nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbon matrix for the electrocatalytic conversion of N2 to NH3. The catalyst with the bonded Al2&#8208;pair site exhibited high Faradaic efficiency and selective NH3 generation. The mechanism follows a six&#8208;electrons transfer pathway for the selective generation of NH3, as revealed by operando surface&#8208;enhanced IR spectroelectrochemistry.







Abstract
Synthesis of ammonia by electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is a promising alternative to the Haber&#8211;Bosch process. However, it is commonly obstructed by the high activation energy. Here, we report the design and synthesis of an Al&#8722;Al bonded dual atomic catalyst stabilized within an amorphous nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbon matrix (Al2NC) with high NRR performance. The dual atomic Al2&#8208;sites act synergistically to catalyze the complex multiple steps of NRR through adsorption and activation, enhancing the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer. This Al2NC catalyst exhibits a high Faradaic efficiency of 16.56&#177;0.3&#8201;% with a yield rate of 29.22&#177;1.2&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1. The dual atomic Al2NC catalyst shows long&#8208;term repeatable, and stable NRR performance. This work presents an insight into the identification of synergistic dual atomic catalytic site and mechanistic pathway for the electrochemical conversion of N2 to NH3.

         <title>Confined&#8208;Coordination Induced Intergrowth of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks into Precise Molecular Sieving Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coordination space properties (size and shape) and environment (solvents: water and DMF) were regulated to decrease the MOF nucleation and growth rate during membrane formation process, alleviating the preferential generation of MOF in the bulk solution and facilitating the intergrowth of MOF crystals into integrated membrane layer with progressively eliminating defects, which endows the MOF membrane with intrinsic angstrom&#8208;sized lattice apertures showing excellent H2/CO2 separation and water desalination performance.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membranes with rich functionality and tunable pore system are promising for precise molecular separation; however, it remains a challenge to develop defect&#8208;free high&#8208;connectivity MOF membrane with high water stability owing to uncontrollable nucleation and growth rate during fabrication process. Herein, we report on a confined&#8208;coordination induced intergrowth strategy to fabricate lattice&#8208;defect&#8208;free Zr&#8208;MOF membrane towards precise molecular separation. The confined&#8208;coordination space properties (size and shape) and environment (water or DMF) were regulated to slow down the coordination reaction rate via controlling the counter&#8208;diffusion of MOF precursors (metal cluster and ligand), thereby inter&#8208;growing MOF crystals into integrated membrane. The resulting Zr&#8208;MOF membrane with angstrom&#8208;sized lattice apertures exhibits excellent separation performance both for gas separation and water desalination process. It was achieved H2 permeance of ~1200 GPU and H2/CO2 selectivity of ~67; water permeance of ~8&#8197;L&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;bar&#8722;1 and MgCl2 rejection of ~95&#8201;%, which are one to two orders of magnitude higher than those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes. The molecular transport mechanism related to size&#8208;sieving effect and transition energy barrier differential of molecules and ions was revealed by density functional theory calculations. Our work provides a facile approach and fundamental insights towards developing precise molecular sieving membranes.

         <title>Regulating the Topology of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting Overall H2O2 Photogeneration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By linking site design, two novel two dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with similar chemical constitutions but different topologies were constructed. TBD&#8208;COF with six&#8208;arm cores and cpt topology exhibited better H2O2 photosynthetic activity than TBC&#8208;COF with three&#8208;arm cores and hcb topology through the O2&#8208;O2.&#8722;&#8208;H2O2, O2&#8208;O2.&#8722;&#8208;O21&#8208;H2O2, and H2O&#8208;H2O2 three channels, inspiring regulating the topology of COFs for boosting overall H2O2 photogeneration.







Abstract
Photocatalytic oxygen reduction reactions and water oxidation reactions are extremely promising green approaches for massive H2O2 production. Nonetheless, constructing effective photocatalysts for H2O2 generation is critical and still challenging. Since the network topology has significant impacts on the electronic properties of two dimensional (2D) polymers, herein, for the first time, we regulated the H2O2 photosynthetic activity of 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) by topology. Through designing the linking sites of the monomers, we synthesized a pair of novel COFs with similar chemical components on the backbones but distinct topologies. Without sacrificial agents, TBD&#8208;COF with cpt topology exhibited superior H2O2 photoproduction performance (6085 and 5448&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in O2 and air) than TBC&#8208;COF with hcb topology through the O2&#8208;O2&#8901;&#8722;&#8208;H2O2, O2&#8208;O2&#8901;&#8722;&#8208;O21&#8208;H2O2, and H2O&#8208;H2O2 three paths. Further experimental and theoretical investigations confirmed that during the H2O2 photosynthetic process, the charge carrier separation efficiency, O2&#8901;&#8722; generation and conversion, and the energy barrier of the rate determination steps in the three channels, related to the formation of *OOH, *O21, and *OH, can be well tuned by the topology of COFs. The current study enlightens the fabrication of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts for H2O2 production by topological structure modulation.

         <title>A Computational Pipeline for Accurate Prioritization of Protein&#8208;Protein Binding Candidates in High&#8208;Throughput Protein Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a computational pipeline that identifies peptide epitopes that bind a particular receptor from a library of possible protein sequences (e.g., coming from high&#8208;throughput experiments). The pipeline uses an AlphaFold&#8208;Competitive Binding Assay (AF&#8208;CBA) to rank order different plausible epitopes and select the most likely one.







Abstract
Identifying the interactome for a protein of interest is challenging due to the large number of possible binders. High&#8208;throughput experimental approaches narrow down possible binding partners but often include false positives. Furthermore, they provide no information about what the binding region is (e.g., the binding epitope). We introduce a novel computational pipeline based on an AlphaFold2 (AF) Competitive Binding Assay (AF&#8208;CBA) to identify proteins that bind a target of interest from a pull&#8208;down experiment and the binding epitope. Our focus is on proteins that bind the Extraterminal (ET) domain of Bromo and Extraterminal domain (BET) proteins, but we also introduce nine additional systems to show transferability to other peptide&#8208;protein systems. We describe a series of limitations to the methodology based on intrinsic deficiencies of AF and AF&#8208;CBA to help users identify scenarios where the approach will be most useful. Given the method&#8216;s speed and accuracy, we anticipate its broad applicability to identify binding epitope regions among potential partners, setting the stage for experimental verification.

We introduce a novel computational pipeline based on an AlphaFold2 (AF) Competitive Binding Assay (AF-CBA) to identify proteins that bind a target of interest from a pull-down experiment and the binding epitope. Our focus is on proteins that bind the Extraterminal (ET) domain of Bromo and Extraterminal domain (BET) proteins, but we also introduce nine additional systems to show transferability to other peptide-protein systems. We describe a series of limitations to the methodology based on intrinsic deficiencies of AF and AF-CBA to help users identify scenarios where the approach will be most useful. Given the method&#8216;s speed and accuracy, we anticipate its broad applicability to identify binding epitope regions among potential partners, setting the stage for experimental verification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantiopure Corral[4]BINOLs as Ultrastrong Receptors for Recognition and Differential Sensing of Steroids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of enantiomeric macrocycles, RRRR&#8208; and SSSS&#8208;C[4]BINOL, demonstrated exceptionally high recognition affinities (up to 1012&#8197;M&#8722;1) towards 16 important steroidal compounds in aqueous solutions, establishing them the most effective known steroid receptors. The two C[4]BINOL enantiomers were employed to compose a fluorescent sensor array which achieved discrimination and sensing of 16 structurally similar steroids in biofluids.







Abstract
The precise recognition and sensing of steroids, a type of vital biomolecules, hold immense practical value across various domains. In this study, we introduced corral[4]BINOLs (C[4]BINOLs), a pair of enantiomeric conjugated deep&#8208;cavity hosts, as novel synthetic receptors for binding steroids. Due to the strong hydrophobic effect of their deep nonpolar, chiral cavities, the two enantiomers of C[4]BINOLs demonstrated exceptionally high recognition affinities (up to 1012&#8197;M&#8722;1) for 16 important steroidal compounds as well as good enantioselectiviy (up to 15.5) in aqueous solutions, establishing them as the most potent known steroid receptors. Harnessing their ultrahigh affinity, remarkable enantioselectivity, and fluorescence emission properties, the two C[4]BINOL enantiomers were employed to compose a fluorescent sensor array which achieved discrimination and sensing of 16 structurally similar steroids at low concentrations.

         <dc:description>
Nonlinear photochromic reaction of a rhodamine spirolactam derivative easily synthesized from rhodamine B has been achieved in the Research Article (e202404140) by Yuki Nagai, Yoichi Kobayashi et&#8197;al. The nonlinear behavior results from efficient intersystem crossing and thereby triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation without triplet sensitizers. In addition, using triplet sensitizers extends the responsive wavelength from the blue to red region.

         <title>Recent Advances in Environmentally Friendly Dual&#8208;crosslinking Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Environmentally friendly dual&#8208;crosslinking polymer networks (EF&#8208;DCPNs) emerge as breakthrough solutions to address the trade&#8208;off between mechanical robustness and dynamic behaviors, while greatly eliminating environmental impacts. This review summarizes current status of synthesis, properties, and applications of EF&#8208;DCPNs and provides perspectives on the future development in this important field.







Abstract
Environmentally friendly crosslinked polymer networks feature degradable covalent or non&#8208;covalent bonds, with many of them manifesting dynamic characteristics. These attributes enable convenient degradation, facile reprocessibility, and self&#8208;healing capabilities. However, the inherent instability of these crosslinking bonds often compromises the mechanical properties of polymer networks, limiting their practical applications. In this context, environmentally friendly dual&#8208;crosslinking polymer networks (denoted EF&#8208;DCPNs) have emerged as promising alternatives to address this challenge. These materials effectively balance the need for high mechanical properties with the ability to degrade, recycle, and/or self&#8208;heal. Despite their promising potential, investigations into EF&#8208;DCPNs remain in their nascent stages, and several gaps and limitations persist. This Review provides a comprehensive overview of the synthesis, properties, and applications of recent progress in EF&#8208;DCPNs. Firstly, synthetic routes to a rich variety of EF&#8208;DCPNs possessing two distinct types of dynamic bonds (i.e., imine, disulfide, ester, hydrogen bond, coordination bond, and other bonds) are introduced. Subsequently, complex structure&#8208; and dynamic nature&#8208;dependent mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties of EF&#8208;DCPNs are discussed, followed by their exemplary applications in electronics and biotechnology. Finally, future research directions in this rapidly evolving field are outlined.

         <title>Best Practices for Experiments and Reports in Photocatalytic Methane Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review intends to establish standardized practices for experimental procedures and reporting metrics in photocatalytic CH4 conversion. It is structured into sections that focus on reactor design, products measurement and definition of performance metrics. We provide comprehensive insights into the field of photocatalytic CH4 conversion, and envision that this overview will promote the transition of solar fuel technology from laboratory to manufacture.







Abstract
Efficiently converting methane into valuable chemicals via photocatalysis under mild condition represents a sustainable route to energy storage and value&#8208;added manufacture. Despite continued interest in this area, the achievements have been overshadowed by the absence of standardized protocols for conducting photocatalytic methane oxidation experiments as well as evaluating the corresponding performance. In this review, we present a structured solution aimed at addressing these challenges. Firstly, we introduce the norms underlying reactor design and outline various configurations in the gas&#8211;solid and gas&#8211;solid&#8211;liquid reaction systems. This discussion helps choosing the suitable reactors for methane conversion experiments. Subsequently, we offer a comprehensive step&#8208;by&#8208;step protocol applicable to diverse methane&#8208;conversion reactions. Emphasizing meticulous verification and accurate quantification of the products, this protocol highlights the significance of mitigating contamination sources and selecting appropriate detection methods. Lastly, we propose the standardized performance metrics crucial for evaluating photocatalytic methane conversion. By defining these metrics, the community could obtain the consensus of assessing the performance across different studies. Moving forward, the future of photocatalytic methane conversion necessitates further refinement of stringent experimental standards and evaluation criteria. Moreover, development of scalable reactor is essential to facilitate the transition from laboratory proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept to potentially industrial production.

Solar&#8208;driven photocatalysis employing particulate semiconductors represents a promising approach for sustainable production of valuable chemical feedstock. Metal poly(heptazine imide) (MPHI), a novel 2D ionic carbon nitride, has been recognized as an emerging photocatalyst with distinctive properties. In this minireview, we first delineate the forefront innovations of MPHI photocatalysts, spanning from synthetic strategies and solving structures to the exploration of novel properties. We place special emphasis on the structural design principles aimed at developing high&#8208;performance MPHI systems toward photocatalytic solar fuel production such as H2 evolution, H2O oxidation, H2O2 production and CO2 reduction.

         <title>Disaggregation&#8208;Activated pan&#8208;COX Imaging Agents for Human Soft tissue Sarcoma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>

First disaggregation induced pan&#8208;COX imaging agents shed light on cancer stem cells in human sarcoma tissue. Using the pan&#8208;COX targeting indomethacin conjugated BODIPY fluorophore, disaggregation dependent turn&#8208;on chemosensor was designed for parafin&#8208;fixed tissue imaging. Disaggregation schematics are created with BioRender.com







Abstract
Cancer stem cells are pivotal players in tumors initiation, growth, and metastasis. While several markers have been identified, there remain challenges particularly in heterogeneous malignancies like adult soft tissue sarcomas, where conventional markers are inherently overexpressed. Here, we designed BODIPY scaffold fluorescence probes (BD&#8208;IMC&#8208;1, BD&#8208;IMC&#8208;2) that activate via disaggregation targeting for cyclooxygenase (COX), a potential marker for CSCs in sarcoma in clinical pathology. Based on their structures, BD&#8208;IMC&#8208;1 showcased higher susceptibility to disaggregation compared to BD&#8208;IMC&#8208;2, consistent with their selective interaction with COX. Notably, the BD&#8208;IMC&#8208;1 revealed positive cooperativity binding to COX&#8208;2 at sub&#8208;micromolar ranges. Both probes showed significant fluorescence turn&#8208;on upon LPS or PMA triggered COX&#8208;2 upregulation in live RAW264.7, HeLa, and human sarcoma cell line (Saos&#8208;LM2) up to 2&#8208;fold increase with negligible toxicity. More importantly, the BD&#8208;IMC&#8208;1 demonstrated their practical imaging for COX&#8208;2 positive cells in paraffin&#8208;fixed human sarcoma tissue. Considering the fixed tissues are most practiced pathological sample, our finding suggests a potential of disaggregation activated chemosensor for clinical applications.

         <title>Self&#8208;Sorting of Interfacial Compatibility in MOF&#8208;Based Mixed Matrix Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spontaneous partitioning of MOF particles into one polymer domain in a phase separated&#8208;mixed matrix membrane (PS&#8208;MMM) realizes rapid ranking of the interfacial compatibility of various MOF&#8208;polymer pairs. This strategy will be a valuable tool to guide the design of MMMs with more predictable gas separation properties.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) have shown great promises to overcome the performance upper limit of polymeric membranes for various gas separation processes. However, the gas separation properties of the MMMs largely depend on the MOF&#8208;polymer interfacial compatibility which is a metric difficult to quantify. In most cases, whether a MOF filler and a polymer matrix make a good pair is not revealed until the gas transport experiments are performed. This is because there is a lack of characterization techniques to directly probe the MOF&#8208;polymer interfacial compatibility. In this work, we demonstrate a self&#8208;sorting method to rank the interface compatibility among several MOF&#8208;polymer pairs. By mixing one MOF with two polymers in an MMM, the demixing of two polymers will form two polymer domains. The MOF particles will preferably partition into the &#8220;preferred&#8221; polymer domain due to their higher interfacial affinity.

     alt="Self-Sorting of Interfacial Compatibility in MOF-Based Mixed Matrix Membranes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spontaneous partitioning of MOF particles into one polymer domain in a phase separated-mixed matrix membrane (PS-MMM) realizes rapid ranking of the interfacial compatibility of various MOF-polymer pairs. This strategy will be a valuable tool to guide the design of MMMs with more predictable gas separation properties.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)-based mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) have shown great promises to overcome the performance upper limit of polymeric membranes for various gas separation processes. However, the gas separation properties of the MMMs largely depend on the MOF-polymer interfacial compatibility which is a metric difficult to quantify. In most cases, whether a MOF filler and a polymer matrix make a good pair is not revealed until the gas transport experiments are performed. This is because there is a lack of characterization techniques to directly probe the MOF-polymer interfacial compatibility. In this work, we demonstrate a self-sorting method to rank the interface compatibility among several MOF-polymer pairs. By mixing one MOF with two polymers in an MMM, the demixing of two polymers will form two polymer domains. The MOF particles will preferably partition into the &#8220;preferred&#8221; polymer domain due to their higher interfacial affinity. By scanning different polymer pairs, a rank of MOF-polymer interfacial compatibility from high to low can be obtained. Moreover, based on this ranking, it was also found that a highly compatible MOF-polymer pair suggested by this method also corresponds to a more predictable MMM gas separation performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

An unprecedented photo&#8208;driven quadruple sequential sigmatropic rearrangements of &#945;&#8208;aryl &#945;&#8208;diazo alkynylketones with aminals via 1,6&#8208;dipolar ion intermediate is disclosed. This protocol provides a facile access to synthetically useful multi&#8208;substituted conjugated dienes in highly stereoselective manner via visible light catalysis in mild conditions.







Abstract
We here reported a highly stereoselective method for the synthesis of polysubstituted conjugated dienes from &#945;&#8208;aryl &#945;&#8208;diazo alkynyl ketones and pyrazole&#8208;substituted unsymmetric aminals under mild conditions, which was promoted by photo&#8208;irridation and involved with 1,6&#8208;dipolar intermediate and quadruple sigmatropic rearrangements, was successfully developed. In this transformation, the cleavage of four bonds and the recombination of five bonds were implemented in one operational step. This protocol provided a modular tool for constructing dienes from amines, pyrazoles and &#945;&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diazoketones in one&#8208;pot manner. The results of mechanistic investigation indicated that the plausible reaction path underwent the 1,6&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement instead of the 1,5&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement.

         <title>Mechanistic Approach Toward the C4&#8208;Selective Amination of Pyridines via Nucleophilic Substitution of Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailored pyridine reagents undergo nucleophilic substitution of hydrogen (SNH) reactions with activated pyridines to afford pyridyl pyridinium salts in C4&#8208;selectivity. These salts can be in situ converted to 4&#8208;aminopyridines by aqueous ammonia or utilized as synthetic linchpins for general pyridine C4&#8208;functionalization. The elucidation of the selectivity principles has further guided the C4&#8208;selective functionalization of other (di)azines.







Abstract
The development of site&#8208;selective functionalization of N&#8208;heteroarenes is highly desirable in streamlined synthesis. In this context, direct amination of pyridines stands as an important synthetic methodology, with particular emphasis on accessing 4&#8208;aminopyridines, a versatile pharmacophore in medicinal chemistry. Herein, we report a reaction manifold for the C4&#8208;selective amination of pyridines by employing nucleophilic substitution of hydrogen (SNH). Through 4&#8208;pyridyl pyridinium salt intermediates, 4&#8208;aminopyridine products are obtained in reaction with aqueous ammonia without intermediate isolation. The notable regioselectivity was achieved by the electronic tuning of the external pyridine reagents along with the maximization of polarizability in the proton elimination stage. Further mechanistic investigations provided a guiding principle for the selective C&#8722;H pyridination of additional N&#8208;heteroarenes, presenting a strategic avenue for installation of diverse functional groups.

         <title>Achieving Exceptional Thermal and Hydrolytic Resistance in Chemically Circular Polyesters via In&#8208;Chain 1,3&#8208;Cyclobutane Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyesters P(4R&#8208;BL) (R=Ph, Bu), with 1,3&#8208;cyclobutane rings in the backbone, have been developed to demonstrate exceptional thermal stability (Td,5%=376&#8211;380&#8201;&#176;C) and resistance to hydrolysis (intact in pH&#8197;0&#8211;14). Distinguished from classic polyesters, they exhibit good chemical circularity and offer adjustable material performances comparable to those of non&#8208;degradable syndiotactic polystyrene and low&#8208;density polyethylene.







Abstract
Polyesters, a highly promising class of circular polymers for achieving a closed&#8208;loop sustainable plastic economy, inherently exhibit material stability defects, especially in thermal and hydrolytic instability. Here, we introduce a class of polyesters, P(4R&#8208;BL) (R=Ph, Bu), featuring conformationally rigid 1,3&#8208;cyclobutane rings in the backbone. These polyesters not only exhibit superior thermostability (Td,5%=376&#8211;380&#8201;&#176;C) but also demonstrate exceptional hydrolytic resistance with good integrity even after 1 year in basic and acidic aqueous solutions, distinguishing themselves from typical counterparts. Tailoring the flexibility of the side group R enables the controlled thermal and mechanical performance of P(4Ph&#8208;BL) and P(4Bu&#8208;BL) to rival durable syndiotactic polystyrene (SPS) and low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE), respectively. Significantly, despite their high stability, both polyesters can be effectively depolymerized into pristine monomers, establishing a circular life cycle.

         <title>Selective Defluorination of Trifluoromethyl Substituents by Conformationally Induced Remote Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amide derivatives of trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted benzaldehydes, and their heterocyclic congeners, may be selectively cyclodefluorinated by a remote substitution reaction under mild conditions, giving difluoromethyl&#8208;substituted aldehydes after hydrolysis. Selective single and double defluorinations are possible using this method, which provides a versatile route to difluoromethyl arenes.







Abstract
The selective reduction of an aromatic trifluoromethyl substituent to a difluoromethyl substituent may be achieved by base&#8208;promoted elimination to form a difluoro&#8208;p&#8208;quinomethide which is trapped by an intramolecular nucleophile. High yields are obtained when the nucleophilic trap entails the conformationally favoured cyclisation of an aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) derivative. The resulting cyclised difluoromethyl&#8208;substituted arylimidazolidinone products are readily converted to versatile difluoromethyl&#8208;substituted aldehydes by reduction and hydrolysis. Defluorination is successful on a range of benzenoid (both para and ortho CF3&#8208;substituted) and heterocyclic substrates. Double defluorination may likewise be achieved sequentially, or in a single step, from an Aib dipeptide derivative.

         <title>Perfluorooxosulfate Salts as SOF4&#8208;Gas&#8208;Free Precursors to Multidimensional SuFEx Electrophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfurimidoyl difluorides (RNSOF2) are excellent multidimensional SuFEx hubs, however their preparation from the scarcely available thionyl tetrafluoride (SOF4) gas limits this chemistry. Here, we propose silver pentafluorooxosulfate (AgOSF5) as a viable alternative to SOF4. Prepared by the AgF2&#8208;mediated oxidation of SOCl2, we found that the adduct produces sulfurimidoyl fluorides in high yields from primary amines, also extendable to AgOSF4CF3.







Abstract
Sulfur(VI) Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx) chemistry stands as a well&#8208;established method for swiftly constructing complex molecules in a modular fashion. An especially promising segment of this toolbox is reserved for multidimensional SuFEx hubs: three or more substituents pluggable into a singular SVI centre to make &#8216;beyond&#8208;linear&#8217; clicked constructions. Sulfurimidoyl difluorides (RNSOF2) stand out as the prime example of this, however their preparation from the scarcely available thionyl tetrafluoride (SOF4) limits this chemistry to only a few laboratories with access to this gas. In this work, we identify silver pentafluorooxosulfate (AgOSF5) as a viable SuFEx hub with reactivity equal to SOF4. The AgF2&#8208;mediated oxidation of SOCl2 gives rise to the hexacoordinate AgOSF5 adduct, which in contact with primary amines produces the sulfurimidoyl fluorides in high yields. In addition, we have found this workflow to be fully extendable to the trifluoromethyl homologue, AgOSF4CF3, and we propose the use of AgOSF4X salts as a general route to azasulfur SuFEx electrophiles from commercial starting materials.

         <title>Beyond Tertiary Amines: Introducing Secondary Amines by Palladium/Norbornene&#8208;Catalyzed Ortho Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of secondary amines at the aryl iodide ortho position by the palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) catalysis has been developed, which leads to versatile synthetic applications, such as primary amino group installation and concise heterocycle formations.







Abstract
Since the discovery of the palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE)&#8208;catalyzed ortho amination in 2013, escaping the limitation of only yielding tertiary anilines has been a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here, we describe that, by carefully choosing the phosphine ligand and NBE mediator, the installation of a N&#8208;mono&#8208;alkylamino group becomes feasible. The reaction tolerates a wide range of aryl iodide substrates and various N&#8208;mono&#8208;tertiary alkylamine&#8208;derived electrophiles. Both ipso alkenylation and alkynylation can be realized. The synthetic utility of this method is exemplified by the formation of primary amino group via selective deprotection and streamlined access to N&#8208;heterocycles. Preliminary success of installing a bulky N&#8208;secondary alkylamino group and a mechanistic understanding of the decomposition pathways of mono N&#8208;alkylamine electrophiles have been obtained.

A Ni&#8208;catalyzed cyclization/coupling has been developed in which the products are readily linearized to permit regiodefined alkene dicarbofunctionalization. In this reaction, a silicon&#8208;oxygen (Si&#8722;O) bond functions as a detachable linker that can be delinked with several hydride, alkyl, aryl and vinyl nucleophiles to create profusely functionalized 3&#8208;hydroxysilanes.







Abstract
We disclose a Ni&#8208;catalyzed cyclization/alkylmetal interception reaction in which products are readily linearized to permit regiodefined alkene dicarbofunctionalization. This method offers a convenient route to access 1,2&#8208;oxasilolane heterocycles, 3&#8208;hydroxysilanes and 4&#8208;arylalkanols with the formation of C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds at primary and secondary alkyl carbon centers. In this reaction, a silicon&#8208;oxygen (Si&#8722;O) bond functions as a detachable linker that can be delinked with several hydride, alkyl, aryl and vinyl nucleophiles to create profusely functionalized 3&#8208;hydroxysilanes. A silicon motif in the cyclic C(sp3)&#8722;Si&#8722;O construct in 1,2&#8208;oxasilolane heterocycles can also be selectively deleted by Pd&#8208;catalyzed hydrodesilylation affording Si&#8208;ablated linear alcohol products reminiscent of vicinal ethylene dicarbofunctionalization with C(sp3) and C(sp2) carbon sources.

         <title>Buffer Chain Model for Understanding Crystallization Competition in Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystallization competition between conjugated backbones and side chains is critical to obtaining modulated microstructures and improved properties of conjugated polymers. A buffer chain model is proposed here to describe the linker between backbone and side chains. Longer buffer chains in a model polymer system could effectively relieve this crystallization competition, resulting in better charge transport performance.







Abstract
It remains challenging to comprehensively understand the packing models of conjugated polymers, in which side chains play extremely critical roles. The side chains are typically flexible and non&#8208;conductive and are widely used to improve the polymer solubility in organic solutions. Herein, a buffer chain model is proposed to describe link between conjugated backbone and side chains for understanding the relationship of crystallization competition of conductive conjugated backbones and non&#8208;conductive side chains. A longer buffer chain is beneficial for alleviating such crystallization competition and further promoting the spontaneous packing of conjugated backbones, resulting in enhanced charge transport properties. Our results provide a novel concept for designing conjugated polymers towards ordered organization and enhanced electronic properties and highlight the importance of balancing the competitive interactions between different parts of conjugated polymers.

         <title>Discovery of Alloy Catalysts Beyond Pd for Selective Hydrogenation of Reformate via First&#8208;Principle Screening with Consideration of H&#8208;Coverage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the consideration of H coverage effect, the activity of reformate hydrogenation was evaluated according to descriptors, i.e. H coverage and binding energy of atomic hydrogen, and the selectivity was determined based on adsorption energy of benzene. 172 stable alloys were scanned, and Zn3Ir1 alloy was found to present high performance, which was verified by experiments.







Abstract
The highly selective hydrogenation to remove olefins is a significant refining approach for the reformate. Herein, a library of transition metal for reformate hydrogenation is tested experimentally to validate the predictive level of catalytic activity from our theoretical framework, which combines ab initio calculations and microkinetic modeling, with consideration of surface H&#8208;coverage effect on hydrogenation kinetics. The favorable H coverage of specific alloy surface under relevant hydrogenation condition, is found to be determined by its corresponding alloy composition. Besides, olefin hydrogenation rate is determined as a function of two descriptors, i.e. H coverage and binding energies of atomic hydrogen, paving the way to computationally screen on metal component in the periodic table. Evaluation of 172 bimetallic alloys based on the activity volcano map, as well as benzene hydrogenation rate, identifies prospective superior candidates and experimentally confirms that Zn3Ir1 outperforms pure Pd catalysts for the selective hydrogenation refining of reformate. The insights into H&#8208;coverage&#8208;related microkinetic modelling have enabled us to both theoretically understand experimental findings and identify novel catalysts, thus, bridging the gap between first&#8208;principle simulations and industrial applications. This work provides useful guidance for experimental catalyst design, which can be easily extended to other hydrogenation reaction.

         <title>Acceptor&#8208;Reactivity&#8208;Controlled Stereoconvergent Synthesis and Immunological Activity of a Unique Pentasaccharide from the Cell Wall Polysaccharide of Cutibacterium acnes C7</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of a unique pentasaccharide repeating unit from the cell wall polysaccharide of Cutibacterium acnes C7 has been achieved via an acceptor&#8208;reactivity&#8208;controlled stereoconvergent [2+2+1] and one&#8208;pot chemoselective glycosylation strategy. Immunological activity tests indicate that the pentasaccharide can induce the production of proinflammatory cytokine TNF&#8208;&#945; in a dose&#8208;dependent manner.







Abstract
Bacterial cell&#8208;surface polysaccharides are involved in various biological processes and have attracted widespread attention as potential targets for developing carbohydrate&#8208;based drugs. However, the accessibility to structurally well&#8208;defined polysaccharide or related active oligosaccharide domains remains challenging. Herein, we describe an efficiently stereocontrolled approach for the first total synthesis of a unique pentasaccharide repeating unit containing four difficult&#8208;to&#8208;construct 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glycosidic linkages from the cell wall polysaccharide of Cutibacterium acnes C7. The features of our approach include: 1)&#8197;acceptor&#8208;reactivity&#8208;controlled glycosylation to stereoselectively construct two challenging rare 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;ManA2,3(NAc)2 (&#946;&#8208;2,3&#8208;diacetamido&#8208;2,3&#8208;dideoxymannuronic acid) linkages, 2)&#8197;combination use of 6&#8208;O&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldiphenylsilyl (6&#8208;O&#8208;TBDPS)&#8208;mediated steric shielding effect and ether solvent effect to stereoselectively install a 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glucosidic linkage, 3)&#8197;bulky 4,6&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsilylene (DTBS)&#8208;directed glycosylation to stereospecifically construct a 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;galactosidic linkage, 4)&#8197;stereoconvergent [2+2+1] and one&#8208;pot chemoselective glycosylation to rapidly assemble the target pentasaccharide. Immunological activity tests suggest that the pentasaccharide can induce the production of proinflammatory cytokine TNF&#8208;&#945; in a dose&#8208;dependent manner.
