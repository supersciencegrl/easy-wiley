         <title>Alumina &#8208; Stabilized SEI and CEI in Potassium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aluminum oxide (Al2O3) nanopowder is spin&#8208;coated onto both sides of commercial polypropene separator to create artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) and artificial cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) in potassium metal batteries (KMBs). This significantly enhances the stability, including of KMBs with Prussian Blue (PB) cathodes. For example, symmetric cells are stable after 1,000 cycles at 0.5 mA/cm2 &#8208; 0.5 mAh/cm2 and 3.0 mA/cm2 &#8208; 0.5 mAh/cm2. Alumina modified separators promote electrolyte wetting and increase ionic conductivity (0.59 vs. 0.2 mS/cm) and transference number (0.81 vs. 0.23). Cryo&#8208;stage focused ion beam (cryo&#8208;FIB) analysis of cycled modified anode demonstrates dense and planar electrodeposits, versus unmodified baseline consisting of metal filaments (dendrites) interspersed with pores and SEI. Alumina&#8208;modified CEI also suppresses elemental Fe crossover and reduces cathode cracking. Mesoscale modeling of metal &#8211; SEI interactions captures crucial role of intrinsic heterogeneities, illustrating how artificial SEI affects reaction current distribution, conductivity and morphological stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Assisted Catalytic Construction of Nitrogen Stereogenic Center via Formal Desymmetrization of Remote Diols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The control of noncarbon stereogenic centers is of profound importance owing to their enormous interest in bioactive compounds and chiral catalyst or ligand design for enantioselective synthesis. Despite various elegant approaches have been achieved for construction of S&#8208;, P&#8208;, Si&#8208; and B&#8208;stereocenters over the past decades, the catalyst&#8208;controlled strategies to govern the formation of N&#8208;stereogenic compounds have garnered less attention. Here, we disclose the first organocatalytic approach for efficient access to a wide range of nitrogen&#8208;stereogenic compounds through a desymmetrization approach. Intriguingly, the pro&#8208;chiral remote diols, which are previously not well addressed with enantiocontrol, are well differentiated by potent chiral carbene&#8208;bound acyl azolium intermediates. Preliminary studies shed insights on the critical importance of the ionic hydrogen bond (IHB) formed between the dimer aggregate of diols to afford the chiral N&#8208;oxide products that feature a tetrahedral nitrogen as the sole stereogenic element with good yields and excellent enantioselectivities. Notably, the chiral N&#8208;oxide products could offer an attractive strategy for chiral ligand design and discovery of potential antibacterial agrochemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling Tin Halide Perovskite Oxidation Dynamics in Solution for Perovskite Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a leading contender to replace lead halide perovskites, tin&#8208;based perovskites have demonstrated ever increasing performance in solar cells and light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). They tend to be processed with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvent, which has been identified as a major contributor to the Sn(II) oxidation during film fabrication, posing a challenge to the further improvement of Sn&#8208;based perovskites. Herein, we use NMR spectroscopy to investigate the kinetics of the oxidation of SnI2, revealing that autoamplification takes place, accelerating the oxidation as the reaction progresses. We propose a mechanism consistent with these observations involving water participation and HI generation. Building upon these insights, we have developed low&#8208;temperature Sn&#8208;based perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) processed at 60 &#176;C, achieving enhanced external quantum efficiencies (EQEs). Our research underscores the substantial potential of low&#8208;temperature DMSO solvent processes and DMSO&#8208;free solvent systems for fabricating oxidation&#8208;free Sn&#8208;based perovskites, shaping the future direction in processing Sn&#8208;containing perovskite materials and optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Stable MOF&#8208;Type Lead Halide Luminescent Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lead halide molecular ferroelectrics represent an important class of luminescent ferroelectrics, distinguished by their high chemical and structural tunability, excellent processability and distinctive luminescent characteristics. However, their inherent instability, prone to decomposition upon exposure to moisture and light, hinders their broader ferroelectric applications. Herein, for the first time, we present a series of isoreticular metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;type lead halide luminescent ferroelectrics, demonstrating exceptional robustness under ambient conditions for at least 15 months and even when subjected to aqueous boiling conditions. Unlike conventional metal&#8208;oxo secondary building units (SBUs) in MOFs adopting highly centrosymmetric structure with limited structural distortion, our lead halide&#8208;based MOFs occupy structurally deformable [Pb2X]+ (X=Cl&#8722;/Br&#8722;/I&#8722;) SBUs that facilitate a c&#8208;axis&#8208;biased displacement of Pb2+ centers and substantially contribute to thermoinducible structural transformation. Importantly, this class of MOF&#8208;type lead halide ferroelectrics undergo ferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;paraelectric phase transitions with remarkably high Curie temperature of up to 505 K, superior to most of molecular ferroelectrics. Moreover, the covalent bonding between phosphorescent organic component and the light&#8208;harvesting inorganic component achieves efficient spin&#8208;orbit coupling and intersystem crossing, resulting in long&#8208;lived afterglow emission. The compelling combination of high stability, ferroelectricity and afterglow emission exhibited by lead halide MOFs opens up many potential opportunities in energy&#8208;conversion applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Processible and Ultrahigh&#8208;temperature Organic Photothermal Material through Spontaneous and Quantitative [2+2] Cycloaddition&#8211;Cycloreversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Energy conversion, particularly light to heat conversion, has garnered significant attention owing to its prospect in renewable energy exploitation and utilization. Most previous efforts have focused on developing organic photothermal materials for low&#8208;temperature applications, whereas the importance of simplifying the preparation methods of photothermal materials and enhancing their maximum photothermal temperature have been less taken. Herein, we prepare an organic near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal material namely ATT by a spontaneous [2+2] cycloaddition&#8208;cycloreversion reaction. In addition to the solution&#8208;based method, ATT could also be readily preapred by ball milling in a high yield of 90% in just 15 min. ATT powder exhibits a broad absorption extending beyond 2000 nm, excellent processability, and thermal stability. Remarkably, ATT powder can reach an unprecedently temperature as high as 450 &#176;C while maintaining excellent photostability upon photoirradiation. Leveraging its extraordinary photothermal and processable properties, ATT was used in the high&#8208;temperature applications, such as photo&#8208;ignition, photo&#8208;controlled metal processing and high&#8208;temperature shape memory, all of which offer spatiotemporal control capabilities. This work provides a new approach to prepare organic photothermal materials with high temperatures, and pave the way for their applications in extreme environments.</dc:description>

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Conjugated Nanohoops: A new generation of curved materials for organic electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanohoops, cyclic association of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems to form a hoop&#8208;shaped molecule, have been widely developed in the last 15 years. Beyond the synthetic challenge, the strong interest towards these molecules arise from their radially&#8208;oriented &#960;&#8208;orbitals, which provide singular properties to these fascinating structures. Thanks to their particular cylindrical arrangement, this new generation of curved molecules have been already used in many applications such as &#160;host&#8208;guest complexation, biosensing, bioimaging, solid&#8208;state emission and catalysis. However, their potential in organic electronics has only started to be explored. From the first incorporation as an emitter in fluorescent Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED), to the recent first incorporation as host in Phosphorescent OLED or as charge transporter in Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistor (OFET) and in Organic Photovoltaics (OPV), this field has shown important breakthroughs in recent years. These finding have revealed that curved materials can play a key role in the future and can even be more efficient than their linear counterparts. This can have important repercussions for the future of electronics. Time is now come to overview the different nanohoops used to date in electronic devices in order to stimulate the future molecular designs of functional materials based on these macrocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong and Tough MXene Bridging&#8208;induced Conductive Nacre</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nacre is a classic model, providing an inspiration for fabricating high&#8208;performance bulk nanocomposites with the two&#8208;dimensional platelets. However, the &#8220;brick&#8221; of nacre, aragonite platelet, is an ideal building block for making high&#8208;performance bulk nanocomposites. Herein, we demonstrated a strong and tough conductive nacre through reassembling aragonite platelets with bridged by MXene nanosheets and hydrogen bonding, not only providing high mechanical properties but also excellent electrical conductivity. The flexural strength and fracture toughness of the obtained conductive nacre reach ~ 282 MPa and ~ 6.3 MPa m1/2, which is 1.6 and 1.6 times higher than that of natural nacre, respectively. These properties are attributed to densification and high orientation degree of the conductive nacre, which is effectively induced by the combined interactions of hydrogen bonding and MXene nanosheets bridging. The crack propagations in conductive nacre are effectively inhibited through crack deflection with hydrogen bonding, and MXene nanosheets bridging between aragonite platelets. In addition, our conductive nacre also provides a self&#8208;monitoring function for structural damage and offers exceptional electromagnetic interference shielding performance. Our strategy of reassembling the aragonite platelets exfoliated from waste nacre into high&#8208;performance artificial nacre, provides an avenue for fabricating high&#8208;performance bulk nanocomposites through the sustainable reutilization of shell resources.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Arylation of RNA 2&#8242;&#8208;OH Groups via SNAr Reaction with Trialkylammonium Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterocyclic trialkylammonium arylating agents are shown to react efficiently with RNA in water, placing aryl ethers at 2&#8242;&#8208;O positions in the biopolymer. The reagents, which are stable for weeks in water but react with RNA in minutes to hours, can be used to modify and label RNA, and to probe its structure.







Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule reactions at the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH groups of RNA enable useful applications for transcriptome technology and biology. To date, all reactions have involved carbonyl acylation and mechanistically related sulfonylation, limiting the types of modifications and properties that can be achieved. Here we report that electron&#8208;deficient heteroaryl species selectively react with 2&#8242;&#8208;OH groups of RNA in water via SNAr chemistry. In particular, trialkyl&#8208;ammonium (TAA)&#8208;activated aromatic heterocycles, prepared in one step from aryl chloride precursors, give high conversions to aryl ether adducts with RNAs in aqueous buffer in ~2&#8211;3&#8197;h. Remarkably, a TAA triazine previously used only for reaction with carboxylic acids, shows unprecedented selectivity for RNA over water, reacting rapidly with 2&#8242;&#8208;OH groups while exhibiting a half&#8208;life in water of &gt;10&#8197;days. We further show that a triazine aryl species can be used as a probe at trace&#8208;level yields to map RNA structure in vitro. Finally, we prepare a number of functionalized trialkylammonium triazine reagents and show that they can be used to covalently label RNA efficiently for use in vitro and in living cells. This direct arylation chemistry offers a simple and distinct structural scaffold for post&#8208;synthetic RNA modification, with potential utility in multiple applications in transcriptome research.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Arylation Polymerization at Ambient Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present an ambient&#8208;temperature ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylative polymerization. The present polymerization can produce various meta&#8208; and para&#8208;linked polymers with high molecular weights. Notably, the mild reaction conditions are beneficial in terms of chemoselectivity. Our strategy thus opens a new avenue for sustainable and highly selective polymerizations.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation polymerization (CHAP) is an attractive tool for constructing &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers in a sustainable manner. However, the existing methods primarily rely on palladium catalysis, which usually entails harsh reaction conditions and branching/cross&#8208;linking. Here we report the first example of an ambient&#8208;temperature ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation polymerization induced by visible light irradiation. The present polymerization can produce various meta&#8208; and para&#8208;linked polymers in excellent yields with high molecular weights. The remarkable feature of our mild reaction platform is represented by high chemoselectivity, leading to polymers that are otherwise inaccessible under conventional reaction conditions at high temperatures.

         <title>Unveiling the Pivotal Role of dx2&#8722;y2 Electronic States in Nickel&#8208;Based Hydroxide Electrocatalysts for Methanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dx2&#8722;y2 electronic state within antibonding bands plays a decisive role in the Ni(OH)2&#8208;based methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). The onset potential depends on the deprotonation ability (Ni2+ to Ni3+), which was closely related to the band center of dx2&#8722;y2 orbital. The closer of dx2&#8722;y2 orbital to the Fermi level showed the stronger the deprotonation ability. Meanwhile, in the high potential region, the broadening of dx2&#8722;y2 orbital would facilitate the electron transfer from methanol to catalysts (Ni3+ to Ni2+), further enhancing the catalytic properties. This work provides a new design paradigm for developing next&#8208;generation high&#8208;efficiency Ni(OH)2&#8208;based catalysts for MOR.







Abstract
The anodic methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) plays a crucial role in coupling with the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and enables the sustainable production of the high&#8208;valued formate. Nickel&#8208;based hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) as MOR electrocatalyst has attracted enormous attention. However, the key factor determining the intrinsic catalytic activity remains unknown, which significantly hinders the further development of Ni(OH)2 electrocatalyst. Here, we found that the 
 electronic state within antibonding bands plays a decisive role in the whole MOR process. The onset potential depends on the deprotonation ability (Ni2+ to Ni3+), which was closely related to the band center of 
 orbital. The closer of 
 orbital to the Fermi level showed the stronger the deprotonation ability. Meanwhile, in the high potential region, the broadening of 
 orbital would facilitate the electron transfer from methanol to catalysts (Ni3+ to Ni2+), further enhancing the catalytic properties. Our work for the first time clarifies the intrinsic relationship between 
 electronic state and the MOR activities, which adds a new layer of understanding to the methanol electrooxidation research scene.

         <title>3D Printing of Aqueous Two&#8208;Phase Systems with Linear and Bottlebrush Polyelectrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new polyelectrolyte complex, comprising anionic bottlebrush polymer and cationic linear polymer, exhibits a broader phase separation diagram and higher salt resistance capacity and vary spherical&#8208;like to core&#8211;shell&#8208;like conformation. Utilizing this system creates a tubular&#8208;like flow structure at the interface of two aqueous liquids, enhancing the structural stability, offering a more efficient and easy method for particle transport.







Abstract
We formed core&#8211;shell&#8208;like polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) from an anionic bottlebrush polymer with poly (acrylic acid) side chains with a cationic linear poly (allylamine hydrochloride). By varying the pH, the number of side chains of the polyanionic BB polymers (Nbb), the charge density of the polyelectrolytes, and the salt concentration, the phase separation behavior and salt resistance of the complexes could be tuned by the conformation of the BBs. By combining the linear/bottlebrush polyelectrolyte complexation with all&#8208;liquid 3D printing, flow&#8208;through tubular constructs were produced that showed selective transport across the PEC membrane comprising the walls of the tubules. These tubular constructs afford a new platform for flow&#8208;through delivery systems.

By combining the linear/bottlebrush polyelectrolyte complexation with all-liquid 3D printing, flow-through tubular constructs were produced that showed selective transport across the PEC membrane comprising the walls of the tubules. These tubular constructs afford a new platform for flow-through delivery systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Reductive &#945;&#8208;Chloro&#8208;Carbonyl Addition of Ketimine to Construct the &#946;&#8208;Tertiary Amino Acid Analogues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reductive addition reaction of ketimine using &#945;&#8208;chloro carbonyl electrophile has been developed to access diversified enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;tertiary amino acid with excellent enantioselectivity and broad functional group tolerance. The synthetic utility of this protocol includes the efficient assembly of iterative amino acid units and oligopeptide.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Tertiary amino acid derivatives constitute one of the most frequently occurring units in natural products and bioactive molecules. However, the efficient asymmetric synthesis of this motif still remains a significant challenge. Herein, we disclose a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reductive addition reaction of ketimine using &#945;&#8208;chloro carbonyl compound as a radical precursor, providing expedient access to a diverse array of enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;quaternary amino acid analogues. This protocol exhibits outstanding enantioselectivity and broad substrate scope with excellent functional group tolerance. Preliminary mechanism studies rule out the possibility of Reformatsky&#8208;type addition and confirm the involvement of radical species in stereoselective addition process. The synthetic utility has been demonstrated through the rapid assembly of iterative amino acid units and oligopeptide, showcasing its versatile platform for late&#8208;stage modification of drug candidates.

         <title>Taylor Dispersion&#8208;Induced Phase Separation for the Efficient Characterisation of Protein Condensate Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein phase separation (PPS) is important in functional and disease biology but is challenging to study. We present Taylor dispersion induced phase separation (TDIPS) to study PPS in a reaction&#8208;diffusion system inside a microfluidic capillary. The resulting data is highly information&#8208;rich and allows for thermodynamic analysis but also efficient screening campaigns of phase separation&#8208;modulating compounds using only nanoliters of sample per data point.







Abstract
Biomolecular condensates have emerged as important structures in cellular function and disease, and are thought to form through liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS). Thorough and efficient in vitro experiments are therefore needed to elucidate the driving forces of protein LLPS and the possibility to modulate it with drugs. Here we present Taylor dispersion&#8208;induced phase separation (TDIPS), a method to robustly measure condensation phenomena using a commercially available microfluidic platform. It uses only nanoliters of sample, does not require extrinsic fluorescent labels, and is straightforward to implement. We demonstrate TDIPS by screening the phase behaviour of two proteins that form biomolecular condensates in vivo, PGL&#8208;3 and Ddx4. Uniquely accessible to this method, we find an unexpected re&#8208;entrant behaviour at very low ionic strength, where LLPS is inhibited for both proteins. TDIPS can also probe the reversibility of assemblies, which was shown for both &#945;&#8208;synuclein and for lysozyme, relevant for health and biotechnology, respectively. Finally, we highlight how effective inhibition concentrations and partitioning of LLPS&#8208;modifying compounds can be screened highly efficiently.

         <title>Consolidation of the Oxidant&#8208;Free Au(I)/Au(III) Catalysis Enabled by the Hemilabile Ligand Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this minireview we survey the novel approaches for oxidant&#8208;free Au(I)/Au(III) catalysis focusing on the hemilabile ligand strategy, where (P^N) MeDalphos hemilabile ligand stands as the most successful example. Moreover, hemilabile ligand&#8208;enabled catalysis allows merging oxidative addition with &#960;&#8208;activation, expanding gold&#8216;s versatility in C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom couplings and unprecedented cyclizations. Moreover, recent enantioselective catalysis using chiral hemilabile (P^N) ligands and novel (C^N) hemilabile ligands are also reviewed.







Abstract
In this minireview we survey the challenges and strategies in gold redox catalysis. Gold's reluctance to oxidative addition reactions due to its high redox potential limits its applicability. Initial attempts to overcome this problem focused on the use of sacrificial external oxidants in stoichiometric amounts to bring Au(I) compounds to Au(III) reactive species. Recently, innovative approaches focused on employing hemilabile ligands, which are capable of coordinating to Au(I) and stabilizing square&#8208;planar Au(III) intermediates, thus facilitating oxidative addition steps and enabling oxidant&#8208;free catalysis. Notable examples include the use of the (P^N) bidendate MeDalphos ligand to achieve various cross&#8208;coupling reactions via oxidative addition Au(I)/Au(III). Importantly, hemilabile ligand&#8208;enabled catalysis allows merging oxidative addition with &#960;&#8208;activation, such as oxy&#8208; and aminoarylation of alkenols and alkenamines using organohalides, expanding gold&#8216;s versatility in C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bond formations and unprecedented cyclizations. Moreover, recent advancements in enantioselective catalysis using chiral hemilabile (P^N) ligands are also surveyed. Strikingly, versatile bidentate (C^N) hemilabile ligands as competitors of MeDalphos have appeared recently, by designing scaffolds where phosphine groups are substituted by N&#8208;heterocyclic or mesoionic carbenes. Overall, these approaches highlight the evolving landscape of gold redox catalysis and its tremendous potential in a broad scope of transformations.

         <title>Non&#8208;Fluorinated Ethers to Mitigate Electrode Surface Reactivity in High&#8208;Voltage NCM811&#8208;Li Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a non&#8208;fluorinated ether&#8208;based electrolyte to prolong the lifespan of high&#8208;voltage Ni&#8208;rich ternary LMBs. The electrolyte simultaneously solves the challenges of both the high&#8208;voltage cathode and Li metal anode by mitigating the electrode surface reactivity. The problems of NiO rock&#8208;salt transition, intragranular crack/microstructural defect formation, gas releases, and over&#8208;growth SEI have been alleviated.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) with nickel (Ni)&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes exhibit twice the energy density of conventional Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, their lifespan is limited by severe side reactions caused by high electrode reactivity. Fluorinated solvent&#8208;based electrolytes can address this challenge, but they pose environmental and biological hazards. This work reports on the molecular engineering of fluorine (F)&#8208;free ethers to mitigate electrode surface reactivity in high&#8208;voltage Ni&#8208;rich LMBs. By merely extending the alkyl chains of traditional ethers, we effectively reduce the catalytic reactivity of the cathode towards the electrolyte at high voltages, which suppresses the oxidation decomposition of the electrolyte, microstructural defects and rock&#8208;salt phase formation in the cathode, and gas release issues. The high&#8208;voltage Ni&#8208;rich NCM811&#8208;Li battery delivers capacity retention of 80&#8201;% after 250&#8197;cycles with a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.85&#8201;%, even superior to that in carbonate electrolytes. Additionally, this strategy facilitates passivation of the Li anode by forming a robust solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, boosting the Li reversibility to 99.11&#8201;% with a cycling life of 350&#8197;cycles, which outperforms conventional F&#8208;free ether electrolytes. Consequently, the lifespan of practical LMBs has been prolonged by over 100&#8201;% and 500&#8201;% compared to those in conventional carbonate&#8208; and ether&#8208;based electrolytes, respectively.

         <title>Engineering of Halide Methyltransferase BxHMT through Dynamic Cross&#8208;Correlation Network Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
S&#8208;Adenosylmethionine assumes a crucial role in biocatalytic alkylation. To improve the catalytic ability of BxHMT towards methyl toluene sulfonate, a strategy named dynamic cross&#8208;correlation network analysis (DCCNA) was proposed for the identification of potential mutation sites, both distal and proximal. Experimental results proved the efficiency of the approach, which is expected to be a useful tool for other enzyme engineering studies.







Abstract
Halide methyltransferases (HMTs) provide an effective way to regenerate S&#8208;adenosyl methionine (SAM) from S&#8208;adenosyl homocysteine and reactive electrophiles, such as methyl iodide (MeI) and methyl toluene sulfonate (MeOTs). As compared with MeI, the cost&#8208;effective unnatural substrate MeOTs can be accessed directly from cheap and abundant alcohols, but shows only limited reactivity in SAM production. In this study, we developed a dynamic cross&#8208;correlation network analysis (DCCNA) strategy for quickly identifying hot spots influencing the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme, and applied it to the evolution of HMT from Paraburkholderia xenovorans. Finally, the optimal mutant, M4 (V55T/C125S/L127T/L129P), exhibited remarkable improvement, with a specific activity of 4.08&#8197;U/mg towards MeOTs, representing an 82&#8208;fold increase as compared to the wild&#8208;type (WT) enzyme. Notably, M4 also demonstrated a positive impact on the catalytic ability with other methyl donors. The structural mechanism behind the enhanced enzyme activity was uncovered by molecular dynamics simulations.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-Adenosylmethionine assumes a crucial role in biocatalytic alkylation. To improve the catalytic ability of &lt;i&gt;Bx&lt;/i&gt;HMT towards methyl toluene sulfonate, a strategy named dynamic cross-correlation network analysis (DCCNA) was proposed for the identification of potential mutation sites, both distal and proximal. Experimental results proved the efficiency of the approach, which is expected to be a useful tool for other enzyme engineering studies.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halide methyltransferases (HMTs) provide an effective way to regenerate &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-adenosyl methionine (SAM) from &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-adenosyl homocysteine and reactive electrophiles, such as methyl iodide (MeI) and methyl toluene sulfonate (MeOTs). As compared with MeI, the cost-effective unnatural substrate MeOTs can be accessed directly from cheap and abundant alcohols, but shows only limited reactivity in SAM production. In this study, we developed a dynamic cross-correlation network analysis (DCCNA) strategy for quickly identifying hot spots influencing the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme, and applied it to the evolution of HMT from &lt;i&gt;Paraburkholderia xenovorans&lt;/i&gt;.

Notably, M4 also demonstrated a positive impact on the catalytic ability with other methyl donors. The structural mechanism behind the enhanced enzyme activity was uncovered by molecular dynamics simulations.

         <title>Detergent Chemistry Modulates the Transgression of Planetary Boundaries including Antimicrobial Resistance and Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It's detergent o'clock and the role of detergent chemistry in transgressing Earth's resources is reviewed to support future research that secures safe operating spaces that humanity needs for its survival.







Abstract
Detergent chemistry enables applications in the world today while harming safe operating spaces that humanity needs for survival. Aim of this review is to support a holistic thought process in the design of detergent chemistry. We harness the planetary boundary concept as a framework for literature survey to identify progresses and knowledge gaps in context with detergent chemistry and five planetary boundaries that are currently transgressed, i.e., climate, freshwater, land system, novel entities, biosphere integrity. Our survey unveils the status of three critical challenges to be addressed in the years to come, including (i) the implementation of a holistically, climate&#8208;friendly detergent industry; (ii) the alignment of materialistic and social aspects in creating technical solutions by means of sustainable chemistry; (iii) the development of detergents that serve the purpose of applications but do not harm the biosphere in their role as novel entities. Specifically, medically relevant case reports revealed that even the most sophisticated detergent design cannot sufficiently accelerate drug discovery to outperform the antibiotic resistance development that detergents simultaneously promote as novel entities. Safe operating spaces that humanity needs for its survival may be secured by directing future efforts beyond sustainable chemistry, resource efficiency, and net zero emission targets.

         <title>Alveoli&#8208;Inspired Carbon Cathodes with Interconnected Porous Structure and Asymmetric Coordinated Vanadium Sites for Superior Li&#8722;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alveoli&#8208;inspired carbon cathode with interconnected porous structure and asymmetric coordinated V&#8722;S1N3 sites has been proposed for efficient and stable Li&#8722;S batteries. The asymmetric electronic distribution and large atom radius of S resulted in the sloping adsorption for polysulfide and low thermodynamic energy barriers, which resulted in enhanced sulfur adsorption&#8208;catalytic conversion and stable long&#8208;cycle performance for high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
Accelerating sulfur conversion catalysis to alleviate the shuttle effect has become a novel paradigm for effective Li&#8722;S batteries. Although nitrogen&#8208;coordinated metal single&#8208;atom (M&#8722;N4) catalysts have been investigated, further optimizing its utilization rate and catalytic activities is urgently needed for practical applications. Inspired by the natural alveoli tissue with interconnected structure and well&#8208;distributed enzyme catalytic sites on the wall for the simultaneously fast diffusion and in situ catalytic conversion of substrates, here, we proposed the controllable synthesis of bioinspired carbon cathode with interconnected porous structure and asymmetric coordinated V&#8722;S1N3 sites for efficient and stable Li&#8722;S batteries. The enzyme&#8208;mimetic V&#8722;S1N3 shows asymmetric electronic distribution and high tunability, therefore enhancing in situ polysulfide conversion activities. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the high charge asymmetry degree and large atom radius of S in V&#8722;S1N3 result in sloping adsorption for polysulfide, thereby exhibiting low thermodynamic energy barriers and long&#8208;range stability (0.076&#8201;% decay over 600&#8197;cycles).

         <title>Catalytic Kinetic Resolution of Monohydrosilanes via Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Intramolecular Hydrosilylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic kinetic resolution strategy was developed for the access of chiral Si&#8208;stereogenic silanes. By employing Rh&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydrosilylation, both dihydrobenzosilole&#8208;based organosilanes and monohydrosilane containing ortho&#8208;vinyl group could be prepared with high efficiency and good to excellent selectivity factors in one single operation.







Abstract
The catalytic access of silicon&#8208;stereogenic organosilanes remains a big challenge, and largely depends on the desymmetrization of the symmetric precursors with two identical substitutes attached to silicon atom. Here we report the construction of silicon&#8208;stereogenic organosilanes via catalytic kinetic resolution of racemic monohydrosilanes with good to excellent selectivity factors. Both Si&#8208;stereogenic dihydrobenzosiloles and Si&#8208;stereogenic monohydrosilanes could be efficiently accessed in one single operation via Rh&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective intramolecular hydrosilylation, employing (R,R)&#8208;Et&#8208;DuPhos as the optimal ligand. This catalytic protocol features mild conditions, a low catalyst loading (0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% [Rh(cod)Cl]2), high stereoinduction (S factor up to 152), and excellent scalability. Moreover, further derivatizations led to the efficient synthesis of uncommon middle&#8208;size (7&#8208; and 8&#8208;membered) Si&#8208;stereogenic silacycles. Preliminary mechanistic study indicates this reaction might undergo a modified Chalk&#8211;Harrod mechanism.

         <title>Fabrication of Large&#8208;Area Multi&#8208;Stimulus Responsive Thin Films via Interfacially Confined Irreversible Katritzky Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The large&#8208;area, free&#8208;standing, robust and multi&#8208;stimulus responsive thin films were fabricated through a catalyst&#8208;free and irreversible Katritzky reaction at a liquid&#8211;liquid interface. The thin films exhibit fast photo&#8208;mechanical motions, vapor&#8208;mechanical motions, as well as photo&#8208;chromic and solvato&#8208;chromic behaviors. In addition, the films can harvest anionic radicals and the radicals as captured can be efficiently degraded under UV light illumination.







Abstract
Fabrication of large&#8208;area thin films through irreversible reactions remains a formidable task. This study reports a breakthrough strategy for in situ synthesis of large&#8208;area, free&#8208;standing, robust and multi&#8208;stimulus responsive thin films through a catalyst&#8208;free and irreversible Katritzky reaction at a liquid&#8211;liquid interface. The as resulted films are featured with adjustable thickness of 1&#8211;3&#8197;&#956;m and an area up to 50&#8197;cm2. The thin films exhibit fast photo&#8208;mechanical motions (a response time of ca 0.1&#8197;s), vapor&#8208;mechanical motions, as well as photo&#8208;chromic and solvato&#8208;chromic behaviors. It was revealed that the reason behind the observable motions is proton transfer from the imine groups to the carbonyl structures within the film induced by photo&#8208; and/or dimethyl sulfoxide&#8208;stimulus. In addition, the films can harvest anionic radicals and the radicals as captured can be efficiently degraded under UV light illumination. This study provides a new strategy for fabricating smart thin films via interfacially confined irreversible Katritzky reaction.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the anodic electrocarbonylation of methanol to produce DMC, our theoretical studies suggest Cu&#8722;Pd alloy not only stabilizes Pd0, the true active site, but also reduces the overall energy barrier for DMC formation. The theoretically predicted Pd3Cu, synthesized by a two&#8208;step thermal shock method, achieves FEDMC of 93&#8201;%@1.0&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl, far surpassing existing Pd&#8208;based electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic carbonylation of CO and CH3OH to dimethyl carbonate (DMC) on metallic palladium (Pd) electrode offers a promising strategy for C1 valorization at the anode. However, its broader application is limited by the high working potential and the low DMC selectivity accompanied with severe methanol self&#8208;oxidation. Herein, our theoretical analysis of the intermediate adsorption interactions on both Pd0 and Pd4+ surfaces revealed that inevitable reconstruction of Pd surface under strongly oxidative potential diminishes its CO adsorption capacity, thus damaging the DMC formation. Further theoretical modeling indicates that doping Pd with Cu not only stabilizes low&#8208;valence Pd in oxidative environments but also lowers the overall energy barrier for DMC formation. Guided by this insight, we developed a facile two&#8208;step thermal shock method to prepare PdCu alloy electrocatalysts for DMC. Remarkably, the predicted Pd3Cu demonstrated the highest DMC selectivity among existing Pd&#8208;based electrocatalysts, reaching a peaked DMC selectivity of 93&#8201;% at 1.0&#8197;V versus Ag/AgCl electrode. (Quasi) in situ spectra investigations further confirmed the predicted dual role of Cu dopant in promoting Pd&#8208;catalyzed DMC formation.

         <dc:description>
High&#8208;temperature homopolymer dielectrics with anisotropy have been developed by leveraging the hierarchical structure in semicrystalline polymers. The unique ordering of lamellae in our dielectric films endue a significantly increased breakdown strength and a reduced leakage current compared to amorphous films.







Abstract
High&#8208;temperature dielectric polymers are in high demand for powering applications in extreme environments. Here, we have developed high&#8208;temperature homopolymer dielectrics with anisotropy by leveraging the hierarchical structure in semicrystalline polymers. The lamellae have been aligned parallel to the surface in the dielectric films. This structural arrangement resembles the horizontal alignment of nanosheet fillers in polymer nanocomposites and nanosheet&#8208;like lamellae in block copolymers, which has been proven to provide the optimal topological structure for electrical energy storage. The unique ordering of lamellae in our dielectric films endue a significantly increased breakdown strength and a reduced leakage current compared to amorphous films. This novel approach of enhancing the capacitive energy storage properties by controlled orientation of lamellae in homopolymer offers a new perspective for the design of high&#8208;temperature polymer dielectrics.

         <title>Ethylenedioxythiophene&#8208;Based Small Molecular Donor with Multiple Conformation Locks for Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency of 19.3&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ethylenedioxythiophene was adopted to construct small molecular donor with multiple conformation locks, which can serve as efficient guest donor in ternary organic solar cells to provide cascade energy levels and two&#8208;dimensional charge transport channels, thus enabling high efficiency of 19.3&#8201;% compared to 18.2&#8201;% of the binary device.







Abstract
Ternary organic solar cells (T&#8208;OSCs) represent an efficient strategy for enhancing the performance of OSCs. Presently, the majority of high&#8208;performance T&#8208;OSCs incorporates well&#8208;established Y&#8208;acceptors or donor polymers as the third component. In this study, a novel class of conjugated small molecules has been introduced as the third component, demonstrating exceptional photovoltaic performance in T&#8208;OSCs. This innovative molecule comprises ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) bridge and 3&#8208;ethylrhodanine as the end group, with the EDOT unit facilitating the creation of multiple conformation locks. Consequently, the EDOT&#8208;based molecule exhibits two&#8208;dimensional charge transport, distinguishing it from the thiophene&#8208;bridged small molecule, which displays fewer conformation locks and provides one&#8208;dimensional charge transport. Furthermore, the robust electron&#8208;donating nature of EDOT imparts the small molecule with cascade energy levels relative to the electron donor and acceptor. As a result, OSCs incorporating the EDOT&#8208;based small molecule as the third component demonstrate enhanced mobilities, yielding a remarkable efficiency of 19.3&#8201;%, surpassing the efficiency of 18.7&#8201;% observed for OSCs incorporating thiophene&#8208;based small molecule as the third component. The investigations in this study underscore the excellence of EDOT as a building block for constructing conjugated materials with multiple conformation locks and high charge carrier mobilities, thereby contributing to elevated photovoltaic performance in OSCs.

         <title>Electrochemical Asymmetric Radical Functionalization of Aldehydes Enabled by a Redox Shuttle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aminocatalysis and electrochemistry cooperate, enabling SOMO&#8208;type transformations for asymmetric electrochemical synthesis. Electricity drives enantioselective radical processes via oxidation of catalytically generated enamines. Key is the use of a biphenyl redox shuttle to prevent catalyst degradation, yielding desired compounds with high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Aminocatalysis is a well&#8208;established tool that enables the production of enantioenriched compounds under mild conditions. Its versatility is underscored by its seamless integration with various synthetic approaches. While the combination of aminocatalysis with metal catalysis, photochemistry, and stoichiometric oxidants has been extensively explored, its synergy with electrochemical activation remains largely unexplored. Herein, we present the successful merger of electrochemistry and aminocatalysis to perform SOMO&#8208;type transformations, expanding the toolkit for asymmetric electrochemical synthesis. The methodology harnesses electricity to drive the oxidation of catalytically generated enamines, which ultimately partake in enantioselective radical processes, leading to &#945;&#8208;alkylated aldehydes. Crucially, mechanistic studies highlight how this electrochemical strategy is enabled by the use of a redox shuttle, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dimethoxybiphenyl, to prevent catalyst degradation and furnishing the coveted compounds in good yield and high enantioselectivity.

         <title>Photon Upconversion Cooperates with Downshifting in Chiral Systems: Modulation, Amplification, and Applications of Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photon upconversion, cooperating with downshifting in chiral systems, offers a powerful method to modulate circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in several ways: (1) Dual upconverted CPL (UCCPL) from the acceptor and downshifting CPL (DSCPL) from the donor can be simultaneously emitted upon excitation with low&#8208;energy light. (2) In dual&#8208;excitation system, the acceptor can produce both UCCPL and DSCPL, each with distinct dissymmetry factor values, depending on whether it is excited by low energy or high energy.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active materials are increasingly recognized for their potential applications such as 3D imaging, data storage, and optoelectronic devices. Typically, CPL materials have required high&#8208;energy (HE) photons for excitation to emit low&#8208;energy (LE) circularly polarized light, a process known as downshifting CPL (DSCPL). However, the emergence of upconverted CPL (UCCPL), where the absorption of multi LE photons results in the emission of a single HE photon with circular polarization, has recently attracted considerable attention. This minireview highlights the intricate relationship between upconversion and CPL phenomena. During upconversion, the dissymmetry factor (glum) value can be improved in certain systems. Additionally, the integration of both LE and HE photons in upconversion&#8208;downshifting&#8208;synergistic systems offers avenues for dual&#8208;excitation or dual&#8208;emission CPL functionalities. More in detail, the emerging UCCPL based on various photon upconversion mechanisms and their synergy with DSCPL are introduced. Additionally, several examples that demonstrate the applications of UCCPL are presented to highlight the future opportunities.

Generation of an artificial enzyme that features a secondary amine residue by genetic code expansion is described. The designer enzyme was evolved to catalyze the asymmetric nitrocyclopropanation of cinnamaldehydes at high conversions with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The introduction of an abiological catalytic group into the binding pocket of a protein host allows for the expansion of enzyme chemistries. Here, we report the generation of an artificial enzyme by genetic encoding of a non&#8208;canonical amino acid that contains a secondary amine side chain. The non&#8208;canonical amino acid and the binding pocket function synergistically to catalyze the asymmetric nitrocyclopropanation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes by the iminium activation mechanism. The designer enzyme was evolved to an optimal variant that catalyzes the reaction at high conversions with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. This work demonstrates the application of genetic code expansion in enzyme design and expands the scope of enzyme&#8208;catalyzed abiological reactions.

         <title>Chemical Control of Fluorescence Lifetime towards Multiplexing Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the chemical control of fluorescence lifetimes of boron dipyrromethene derivatives through the photo&#8208;induced electron transfer process and the intramolecular charge transfer process. The resulting fluorophores were applied in fluorescence lifetime multiplexing imaging both in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Fluorescence lifetime imaging has been a powerful tool for biomedical research. Recently, fluorescence lifetime&#8208;based multiplexing imaging has expanded imaging channels by using probes that harbor the same spectral channels and distinct excited state lifetime. While it is desirable to control the excited state lifetime of any given fluorescent probes, the rational control of fluorescence lifetimes remains a challenge. Herein, we chose boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) as a model system and provided chemical strategies to regulate the fluorescence lifetime of its derivatives with varying spectral features. We find electronegativity of structural substituents at the 8&#8242; and 5&#8242; positions is important to control the lifetime for the green&#8208;emitting and red&#8208;emitting BODIPY scaffolds. Mechanistically, such influences are exerted via the photo&#8208;induced electron transfer and the intramolecular charge transfer processes for the 8&#8242; and 5&#8242; positions of BODIPY, respectively. Based on these principles, we have generated a group of BODIPY probes that enable imaging experiments to separate multiple targets using fluorescence lifetime as a signal. In addition to BODIPY, we envision modulation of electronegativity of chemical substituents could serve as a feasible strategy to achieve rational control of fluorescence lifetime for a variety of small molecule fluorophores.

         <title>Similarities and Differences in Benzene Reduction with Ca, Sr, Yb and Sm: Strong Evidence for Tetra&#8208;Anionic Benzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inverse sandwich benzene complexes are prone to metal oxidation state ambiguities. Based on comparisons between alkaline&#8208;earth and lanthanide metals, we provide strong evidence for the formal formation of a SmIII&#8208;benzene4&#8722;&#8208;SmIII complex.







Abstract
Inverse sandwich complexes of Yb and Sm stabilized by a bulky &#946;&#8208;diketiminate (BDI) ligand have been prepared: (BDI)Ln(&#951;6,&#951;6&#8208;C6H6)Ln(BDI); Ln=lanthanide. Coordinated benzene ligands can be neutral, di&#8208;anionic or, often controversially discussed, even tetra&#8208;anionic. The formal charge on benzene is correlated to assignment of the metal oxidation state which generally poses a problem. Herein, we take advantage of the structural similarities found when comparing CaII with YbII, and SrII with SmII complexes. In this work, we found an excellent overlap of the Ca/Yb inverse sandwich structures but a striking difference for the Sr/Sm pair. The much shorter Sm&#8722;N and Sm&#8208;C6H6 distances are strong evidence for a SmIII&#8208;benzene&#8722;4&#8208;SmIII assignment. This was further supported by NMR spectroscopy, magnetic susceptibility, reactivity and comprehensive computational investigation.

         <title>Breaking Highly Ordered PtPbBi Intermetallic with Disordered Amorphous Phase for Boosting Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution and Alcohol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin amorphous/intermetallic heterophase PtPbBi NSs were synthesized for the first time, which exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performance in HER and AORs owing to their unique heterointerfaces and abundant exposed active sites. Construction of amorphous/crystalline heterophase structures with multimetallic composition can effectively optimize the Gibbs free energy and enhance the electron transfer from the surface of the catalyst to *CH2OH.







Abstract
Constructing amorphous/intermetallic (A/IMC) heterophase structures by breaking the highly ordered IMC phase with disordered amorphous phase is an effective way to improve the electrocatalytic performance of noble metal&#8208;based IMC electrocatalysts because of the optimized electronic structure and abundant heterophase boundaries as active sites. In this study, we report the synthesis of ultrathin A/IMC PtPbBi nanosheets (NSs) for boosting hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and alcohol oxidation reactions. The resulting A/IMC PtPbBi NSs exhibit a remarkably low overpotential of only 25&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for the HER in an acidic electrolyte, together with outstanding stability for 100&#8197;h. In addition, the PtPbBi NSs show high mass activities for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR), which are 13.2 and 14.5 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the synergistic effect of amorphous/intermetallic components and multimetallic composition facilitate the electron transfer from the catalyst to key intermediates, thus improving the catalytic activity of MOR. This work establishes a novel pathway for the synthesis of heterophase two&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials with high electrocatalytic performance across a wide range of electrochemical applications.

         <title>Recent Advances and Opportunities in Reactivating Inactive Lithium in Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of inactive lithium is one of the main culprits of lithium metal battery failures. In this Minireview, the first of this kind, we summarized the formation of inactive lithium and reassessed its impact on battery performance metrics, discussed the cutting&#8208;edge of various strategies that have been devised to rejuvenate inactive lithium. By concluding existing strategies, we raised some unsolved questions and highlighted opportunities regarding inactive lithium and essential factors for reactivation strategies.







Abstract
The loss of active materials is one of the main culprits of the battery failures. As a typical example, the presence of inactive lithium, also known as &#8220;dead lithium&#8221;, contributes to the rapid capacity deterioration and reduces energy output in lithium batteries. This phenomenon has long been recognized as irreversible. In this Minireview, the first of this kind, we aim to summarize the formation of inactive lithium and reassess its impact on battery performance metrics. Additionally, we explore various strategies that have been devised to rejuvenate inactive lithium. This comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in reactivating inactive lithium not only offers insights into restoring capacity and enhancing battery performance metrics but also provides a foundation for future research in reviving other inactive materials found in next&#8208;generation batteries, such as lithium metal batteries, lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries, other alkali metal batteries, and liquid flow batteries.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An open&#8208;shell conjugated polymer has been synthesized with the ultralow&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels (&#8722;4.63&#8197;eV) and high&#8208;spin ground&#8208;state, affording a high intrinsic conductivity of 1.04&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 without additional dopants and a power factor of 12.59&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 in organic thermoelectrics.







Abstract
Open&#8208;shell conjugated polymers with a high intrinsic conductivity and high&#8208;spin ground state hold considerable promise for applications in organic electronics and spintronics. Herein, two novel acceptor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8211;A) conjugated polymers based on a highly electron&#8208;deficient quinoidal benzodifurandione unit have been developed, namely DPP&#8208;BFDO&#8208;Th and DPP&#8208;BFDO. The incorporation of the quinoidal moiety into the polymers backbones enables deeply aligned lower&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of below &#8722;4.0&#8197;eV. Notably, DPP&#8208;BFDO exhibits an exceptionally low LUMO (&#8722;4.63&#8197;eV) and a high&#8208;spin ground state characterized by strong diradical characters. Moreover, a self&#8208;doping through intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer is observed for DPP&#8208;BFDO, as evidenced by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies. The high carrier concentration in combination with a planar and linear conjugated backbone yields a remarkable electrical conductivity (&#963;) of 1.04&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 in the &#8220;undoped&#8221; native form, ranking among the highest values reported for n&#8208;type radical&#8208;based conjugated polymers. When employed as an n&#8208;type thermoelectric material, DPP&#8208;BFDO achieves a power factor of 12.59&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2. Furthermore, upon n&#8208;doping, the &#963; could be improved to 65.68&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1. This study underscores the great potential of electron&#8208;deficient quinoidal units in constructing dopant&#8208;free n&#8208;type conductive polymers with a high&#8208;spin ground state and exceptional intrinsic conductivity.

         <title>Small Ionic&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Based Molecule Drives Strong Adhesives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we develop a facile supramolecular modification strategy for the construction of ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;based small&#8208;molecule adhesives. A fundamental understanding of the mechanism underlying the high adhesion strength could serve as a guiding principle for the molecular design of novel adhesive materials. We anticipate that our work will facilitate the advancement and application of small&#8208;molecule adhesives in many burgeoning fields.







Abstract
Nature has inspired scientists to fabricate adhesive materials for applications in many burgeoning areas. However, it is still a significant challenge to develop small&#8208;molecule adhesives with high&#8208;strength, low&#8208;temperature and recyclable properties, although these merits are of great interest in various aspects. Herein, we report a series of strong adhesives based on low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight molecular solids driven by the terminal modification of ionic liquids (ILs) and subsequent supramolecular self&#8208;assembly. The emergence of high strength and liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transitions for these supramolecular aggregates relies on modifying IL with a high melting point motif and enriching the types of noncovalent interactions in the original ILs. Using this strategy, we demonstrate that our IL&#8208;based molecular solids can efficiently obtain a high adhesion strength (up to 8.95&#8197;MPa). Importantly, we elucidate the mechanism underlying the reversible and strong adhesion enabled by monomer&#8208;to&#8208;polymer transitions. These fundamental findings provide guidance for the design of high&#8208;performance supramolecular adhesive materials.

         <title>Development of an FeII Complex Exhibiting Intermolecular Proton Shifting Coupled Spin Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystalline material based on an FeII hydrazone complex was synthesized to observe intermolecular proton shifting. The complex exhibits reversible intermolecular proton shifting&#8208;coupled spin transition. This study paves the way for the development of novel functional materials with tunable properties.







Abstract
In this study, we investigated reversible intermolecular proton shifting (IPS) coupled with spin transition (ST) in a novel FeII complex. The host FeII complex and the guest carboxylic acid anion were connected by intermolecular hydrogen bonds (IHBs). We extended the intramolecular proton transfer coupled ST phenomenon to the intermolecular system. The dynamic phenomenon was confirmed by variable&#8208;temperature single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, neutron crystallography, and infrared spectroscopy. The mechanism of IPS was further validated using density functional theory calculations. The discovery of IPS&#8208;coupled ST in crystalline molecular materials provides good insights into fundamental processes and promotes the design of novel multifunctional materials with tunable properties for various applications, such as optoelectronics, information storage, and molecular devices.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational design of advanced electrolytes to improve the high&#8208;voltage capability has been attracting wide attention as one critical solution to enable next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. However, the limited understanding of electrolyte antioxidant chemistry as well as the lack of valid quantization approaches have resulted in knowledge gap, which hinders the formulation of new electrolytes. Herein, we construct a standard curve based on representative solvation structures to quantify the oxidation stability of ether&#8208;based electrolytes, which reveals the linear correlation between the oxidation potential and the atomic charge of the least oxidation&#8208;resistant solvent. Dictating by the regularity between solvation composition and oxidation potential, a (Trifluoromethyl)cyclohexane&#8208;based localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte dominated by anion&#8208;less solvation structures was designed to optimize the cycling performance of 4.5 V 30&#8208;&#956;m&#8208;Li||3.8&#8208;mAh cm&#8208;2&#8208;LiCoO2 batteries, which maintained 80% capacity retention even after 440 cycles. The consistency of experimental and computational results validates the proposed principles, offering a fundamental guideline to evaluate and design aggressive electrochemical systems.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrazone&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with structural flexibility, heteroatomic sites, post&#8208;modification ability and high hydrolytic stability have attracted great attention from scientific community. Hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs, as a subclass of Schiff&#8208;base COFs, was firstly reported in 2011 by Yaghi&#8217;s group and later witnessed prosperous development in various aspects. Their adjustable structures, precise pore channels and plentiful heteroatomic sites of hydrazone&#8208;linked structures possess much potential in diverse applications, for example, adsorption/separation, chemical sensing, catalysis and energy storage, etc. Up to date, the systematic reviews about the reported hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs are still rare. Therefore, in this review, we will summarize their preparation methods, characteristics and related applications, and discuss the opportunity or challenge of hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs. We hope this review could provide new insights about hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs for exploring more appealing functions or applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Coupling CO2 Reduction and Acetyl&#8208;CoA Formation: The Role of a CO Capturing Tunnel in Enzymatic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bifunctional CO&#8208;dehydrogenase/acetyl&#8208;CoA synthase (CODH/ACS) complex couples the reduction of CO2 to the condensation of CO with a methyl&#8208;moiety and CoA to acetyl&#8208;CoA. Catalysis occurs at two sites connected by a tunnel transporting the CO. Here, we investigated how the bifunctional complex and its tunnel support catalysis using the CODH/ACS from Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans as a model. Although CODH/ACS adapted to form a stable bifunctional complex with a secluded substrate tunnel, catalysis and CO transport is even more efficient when two monofunctional enzymes are coupled. Efficient CO channeling appears to be ensured by hydrophobic binding sites for CO, which act in a bucket&#8208;brigade fashion rather than as a simple tube. Tunnel remodeling showed that opening the tunnel increased activity but impaired directed transport of CO. Constricting the tunnel impaired activity and CO transport, suggesting that the tunnel evolved to sequester CO rather than to maximize turnover.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Adsorbate&#8208;Mediated Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction by Oxygen Vacancy: A Case Study in Ru/TiO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The adsorbate&#8208;mediated strong metal&#8208;support interaction (A&#8208;SMSI) offers a reversible means of altering the selectivity of supported metal catalysts, thereby providing a powerful tool for facile modulation of catalytic performance. However, the fundamental understanding of A&#8208;SMSI remains inadequate and methods for tuning A&#8208;SMSI are still in their nascent stages, impeding its stabilization under reaction conditions. Here, we report that the initial concentration of oxygen vacancy in oxide supports plays a key role in tuning the A&#8208;SMSI between Ru nanoparticles and defected titania (TiO2&#8208;x). Based on this new understanding, we demonstrate the in&#8208;situ formation of A&#8208;SMSI under reaction conditions, obviating the typically required CO2&#8208;rich pretreatment. The as&#8208;formed A&#8208;SMSI layer exhibits remarkable stability at various temperatures, enabling excellent activity, selectivity and long&#8208;term stability in catalyzing the reverse water gas&#8208;shift reaction. This study deepens the understanding of the A&#8208;SMSI and the ability to stabilize A&#8208;SMSI under reaction conditions represents a key step for practical catalytic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Size Control of Chiral Nanospheres Obtained via Nanoprecipitation of Helical Poly(phenylacetylene)s in the Absence of Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanostructuration of dynamic helical polymers such as poly(phenylacetylene)s (PPAs) depends on the secondary structure adopted by the polymer and the functional group used to connect the chiral pendant to the PPA backbone. Thus, while PPAs with dynamic and flexible scaffolds (para&#8208; and meta&#8208;substituted, &#969;1&lt; 165&#186;) generate by nanoprecipitation low polydisperse nanospheres with controllable size at different acetone/water mixtures, those with a quasi&#8208;static behavior and the presence of an extended, almost planar structure (ortho&#8208;substituted, &#969;1&gt; 165&#186;), aggregate into a mixture of spherical and oval nanostructures whose size is not controlled. Photostability studies show that poly(phenylacetylene) particles are more stable to light irradiation than when dissolved macromolecularly. Moreover, the photostability of the particle depends on the secondary structure of the PPA and its screw sense excess. This fact, in combination with the encapsulation ability of these polymer particles, allows the creation of light stimuli&#8208;responsive nanocarriers, whose cargo can be delivered by light irradiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Industrial&#8208;scale Hard Carbon Designed to Regulate Electrochemical Polarization for Fast Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given the merits of abundant resource, low cost and high electrochemical activity, hard carbons have been regarded as one of the most commercializable anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, poor rate capability is one of the main obstacles that severely hinder its further development. In addition, the relationships between preparation method, material structure and electrochemical performance have not been clearly elaborated. Herein, a simple but effective strategy is proposed to accurately construct the multiple structural features in hard carbon via adjusting the components of precursors. Through detailed physical characterization of the hard carbons derived from different regulation steps, and further combined with in&#8208;situ Raman and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) analysis, the network of multiple relationships between preparation method, microstructure, sodium storage behavior and electrochemical performance have been successfully established. Simultaneously, exceptional rate capability about 108.8 mAh g&#8208;1 at 8 A g&#8208;1 have been achieved from RHC sample with high reversible capacity and desirable initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE). Additionally, the practical applications can be extended to cylindrical battery&#160;with excellent cycle behaviors. Such facile approach can provide guidance for large&#8208;scale production of high&#8208;performance hard carbons and provides the possibility of building practical SIBs with high energy density and durability.</dc:description>

         <title>NbC Nanoparticles Decorated Carbon Nanofibers as Highly Active and Robust Heterostructural Electrocatalysts for Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal carbides with metallic properties have been extensively used as electrocatalysts due to their excellent conductivity and unique electronic structures. Herein, NbC nanoparticles decorated carbon nanofibers (NbC@CNFs) are proposed as an efficient and robust catalyst for electrochemical synthesis of ammonia from nitrate/nitrite reduction, which achieves a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 94.4% and a large ammonia yield of 30.9 mg h&#8211;1 mg&#8211;1cat.. In situ electrochemical tests reveal the nitrite reduction at the catalyst surface follows the *NO pathway and theoretical calculations reveal the formation of NbC@CNFs heterostructure significantly broadens density of states nearby the Fermi energy. Finite element simulations unveil that the current and electric field converge on the NbC nanoparticles along the fiber, suggesting the dispersed carbides are highly active for nitrite reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequential Selective Dissolution of Coinage Metals in Recyclable Ionic Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coinage metals Cu, Ag and Au are essential for modern electronics and their recycling from waste materials is becoming increasingly important to guarantee the security of their supply. Designing new sustainable and selective procedures that would substitute currently used processes is crucial. Here, we describe an unprecedented approach for the sequential dissolution of single metals from Cu, Ag and Au mixtures using biomass&#8208;derived ionic solvents and green oxidants. First, Cu can be selectively dissolved in the presence of Ag and Au with choline chloride/urea/H2O2 mixture, followed by the dissolution of Ag in lactic acid/H2O2. Finally, the metallic Au, which is not soluble in either solution above, is dissolved in choline chloride/urea/Oxone. Subsequently, the metals were simply and quantitatively recovered from dissolutions, and the solvents recycled and reused. The applicability of developed approach was demonstrated by recovering metals from electronic waste substrates such as printed circuit boards, gold fingers and solar panels. The dissolution reactions and selectivity were explored with different analytical techniques and DFT calculations. We anticipate our approach will pave a new way for contemporary and sustainable recycling of multi&#8208;metal waste substrates.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Morphological anisotropic engineering is powerful to synthesize metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOF) with versatile physicochemical properties for diverse applications ranging from gas storage/separation to electrocatalysis and batteries, etc. Herein, we developed a carbon substrate guided strategy for facet&#8208;anisotropic growth of Fe&#8208;THBQ (tetrahydroxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone) frameworks, which is built with cubic Fe octamer bridged by two parallel THBQ ligands along three orthogonal axes, extending to a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) framework with pcu&#8208;e network topology. The electronegative O&#8208;containing functional groups on carbon surfaces compete with THBQ linkers to interact with the unsaturated coordinated Fe cations on the {111} facets and selectively inhibit crystal growth along the &lt;111&gt; direction. The morphology of Fe&#8208;THBQ evolves from thermodynamically favored truncated cube to cuboctahedron depending on the O&#8208;containing functional groups on carbon substrate. The Fe&#8208;THBQ with varied morphologies exhibits facet&#8208;dependent performances for lithium storage. This work will shed lights on morphology modulation of MOFs for promising applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemiluminescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is rapidly evolving from an analytical method into an optical microscopy. The orthogonality of the electrochemical trigger and the optical readout distinguishes it from classic microscopy and electrochemical techniques, owing to its near&#8208;zero background, remarkable sensitivity, and absence of photobleaching and phototoxicity. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in ECL imaging technology, emphasising original configurations which enable the imaging of biological entities and the improvement of the analytical properties by increasing the complexity and multiplexing of bioassays.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is rapidly evolving from an analytical method into an optical microscopy. The orthogonality of the electrochemical trigger and the optical readout distinguishes it from classic microscopy and electrochemical techniques, owing to its near-zero background, remarkable sensitivity, and absence of photobleaching and phototoxicity. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in ECL imaging technology, emphasising original configurations which enable the imaging of biological entities and the improvement of the analytical properties by increasing the complexity and multiplexing of bioassays. Additionally, mapping the (electro)chemical reactivity in space provides valuable information on nanomaterials and facilitates deciphering ECL mechanisms for improving their performances in diagnostics and (electro)catalysis. Finally, we highlight the recent achievements in imaging at the ultimate limits of single molecules, single photons or single chemical reactions, and the current challenges to translate the ECL imaging advances to other fields such as material science, catalysis and biology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed Carbon Nanoneedle Electrodes for Dopamine Detection in Drosophila</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In vivo&#160;electrochemistry in small brain regions or synapses requires nanoelectrodes with long straight tips for submicron scale measurements. Nanoelectrodes can be fabricated using a Nanoscribe two&#8208;photon printer, but annealed tips curl if they are long and thin. We propose a new pulling&#8208;force strategy to fabricate a straight carbon nanoneedle structure. A micron&#8208;width bridge is printed between two blocks. The annealed structure shrinks during pyrolysis, and the blocks create a pulling force to form a long, thin, and straight carbon bridge. Parameterization study and COMSOL modeling indicate changes in the block size, bridge size and length affect the pulling force and bridge shrinkage. Electrodes were printed on niobium wires, insulated with aluminum oxide, and the bridge cut with focused ion beam (FIB) to expose the nanoneedle tip. Annealed needle diameters ranged from 400 nm to 5.25 &#181;m and length varied from 50.5 &#181;m to 146 &#181;m. The electrochemical properties are similar to glassy carbon, with good performance for dopamine detection with fast&#8208;scan cyclic voltammetry. Nanoelectrodes enable biological applications, such as dopamine detection in a specific&#160;Drosophila&#160;brain region. Long and thin nanoneedles are generally useful for other applications such as cellular sensing, drug delivery, or gas sensing.</dc:description>

         <title>Acyl Phosphates as Chemically Fueled Building Blocks for Self&#8208;Sustaining Protocells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lipids spontaneously assemble into vesicle&#8208;forming membranes. Such vesicles serve as compartments for even the simplest living systems. Vesicles have been extensively studied for constructing synthetic cells or as models for protocells&#8212;the cells hypothesized to have existed before life. These compartments exist almost always close to equilibrium. Life, however, exists out of equilibrium. In this work, we studied vesicle&#8208;based compartments regulated by a non&#8208;equilibrium chemical reaction network that converts activating agents. In this way, the compartments require a constant or periodic supply of activating agents to sustain themselves. Specifically, we use activating agents to condense carboxylates and phosphate esters into acyl phosphate&#8208;based lipids that form vesicles. These vesicles can only be sustained when condensing agents are present; without them, they decay. We demonstrate that the chemical reaction network can operate on prebiotic activating agents, opening the door to prebiotically plausible, self&#8208;sustainable protocells that compete for resources. In future work, such protocells should be endowed with a genotype, e.g., self&#8208;replicating RNA structures, to alter the protocell's behavior. Such protocells could enable Darwinian evolution in a prebiotically plausible chemical system.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Tetranuclear Manganese Cubane Complex as an Efficient Molecular Electrocatalyst for Two&#8208;electron Water Oxidation Towards Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stable homogenous two&#8208;electron water oxidation electrocatalysts are highly demanded to understand the precise mechanism and reaction intermediates of electrochemical H2O2 production.Here we report a tetranuclear manganese complex with a cubane structure which can electrocatalyze water oxidation to hydrogen peroxide under alkaline and neutral conditions. Such a complex demonstrates an optimal Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 87%, which is the highest FE(H2O2) among reported homogeneous and heterogeneous electrocatalysts. In addition, active species were identified and co&#8208;catalysts were excluded through ESI&#8208;MS characterization. Furthermore, we identified water binding sites and isolated one&#8208;electron oxidation intermediate by chemical oxidation of the catalyst in the presence of water substrates. It is evident that efficient proton&#8208;accepting electrolytes avoid rapid proton building&#8208;up at electrode and substantially improve reaction rate and selectivity. Accordingly, we propose a two&#8208;electron catalytic cycle model for water oxidation to hydrogen peroxide with the bioinspired molecular electrocatalyst. The present work is expected to provide an ideal platform to elucidate the two&#8208;electron WOR mechanism at the atomic level.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;Cyclohexadienes by Birch Reduction in the Presence of Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Birch reductions are well&#8208;known transformations of arenes, applied for large scale synthesis of 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadienes. Herein, we describe first reactions of benzoic acids in the presence of carbonyl compounds, affording aldol products in moderate to high yields. Alkyl aldehydes give the expected nonconjugated dienes by reaction at the &#945;&#8208;position. Interestingly, the intermediately formed enolate attacks aryl aldehydes and ketones from its &#947;&#8208;position, which can be explained by steric hindrance. This opens the door for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes, which are not accessible by classical Birch reductions. Our method is applicable to benzoic, m&#8208; and p&#8208;toluic acid and various carbonyl compounds, and more than 25 new products were isolated in up to 93% yield. Prochiral aryl aldehydes afford diastereomeric mixtures in ratios of about 4:1, but in the cyclohexadiene ring only trans isomers are formed with high selectivity. Finally, the 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes are suitable precursors for further transformations, which we have demonstrated in first examples. Thus, aromatization affords products of a formal meta selective Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation, and four new stereocenters were generated by cycloaddition of singlet oxygen with excellent selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>An Asymmetric Coumarin&#8208;Anthracene Conjugate as Efficient Fullerene&#8208;Free Acceptor for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric wide&#8208;bandgap fullerene&#8208;free acceptors (FFAs) play a crucial role in organic solar cells (OSCs). Here, we designed and synthesized a simple asymmetric coumarin&#8208;anthracene conjugate named CA&#8208;CN with optical bandgap of 2.1 eV in a single&#8208;step condensation reaction. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis confirms various multiple intermolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions. The molecular orbital energy levels of CA&#8208;CN estimated from cyclic voltammetry were found to be suitable for its use as an acceptor for OSCs. Binary OSCs fabricated using CA&#8208;CN as acceptor and PTB7&#8208;Th as the donor achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.13%. We further demonstrate that the insertion of 20 wt% of CA&#8208;CN as a third component in ternary OSCs with PTB7&#8208;Th:DICTF as the host material achieved an impressive PCE of 14.91%, an improvement of ~43% compared to the PTB7&#8208;Th:DICTF binary device (10.38%). Importantly, the ternary blend enhances the absorption coverage from 400 to 800 nm and improves the morphology of the active layer. The findings highlight the efficacy of an asymmetric design approach for FFAs, which paves the way for developing high&#8208;efficiency OSCs at low cost.</dc:description>

         <title>Ruthenium Nanoclusters and Single Atoms on &#945;&#8208;MoC/N&#8208;Doped Carbon Achieves Low&#8208;input/Input&#8208;free Hydrogen Evolution via Decoupled/Coupled Hydrazine Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted H2 evolution method promises low&#8208;input and input&#8208;free hydrogen production. However, developing high&#8208;performance catalysts for hydrazine oxidation (HzOR) and hydrogen evolution (HER) is challenging. Here, we introduce a bifunctional electrocatalyst &#945;&#8208;MoC/N&#8208;C/RuNSA, merging ruthenium (Ru) nanoclusters (NCs) and single atoms (SA) into cubic &#945;&#8208;MoC nanoparticles&#8208;decorated N&#8208;doped carbon (&#945;&#8208;MoC/N&#8208;C) nanowires, through electrodeposition. The composite showcases exceptional activity for both HzOR and HER, requiring &#8208;80 mV and &#8208;9 mV respectively to reach 10 mA cm&#8208;2. Theoretical and experimental insights confirm the importance of two Ru species for bifunctionality: NCs enhance the conductivity, and its coexistence with SA balances the H adsorption for HER and facilitates the initial dehydrogenation during the HzOR. In the overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) system, &#945;&#8208;MoC/N&#8208;C/RuNSA excels as both anode and cathode materials, achieving 10 mA cm&#8208;2 at just 64 mV. The zinc hydrazine (Zn&#8208;Hz) battery assembled with &#945;&#8208;MoC/N&#8208;C/RuNSA cathode and Zn foil anode can exhibit 96% energy efficiency, as well as temporary separation of hydrogen gas during the discharge process. Therefore, integrating Zn&#8208;Hz with OHzS system enables self&#8208;powered H2 evolution, even in hydrazine sewage. Overall, the amalgamation of NCs with SA achieves diverse catalytic activities for yielding multifold hydrogen gas through advanced cell&#8208;integrated&#8208;electrolyzer system.</dc:description>

Here, we introduce a bifunctional electrocatalyst &#945;-MoC/N-C/RuNSA, merging ruthenium (Ru) nanoclusters (NCs) and single atoms (SA) into cubic &#945;-MoC nanoparticles-decorated N-doped carbon (&#945;-MoC/N-C) nanowires, through electrodeposition. The composite showcases exceptional activity for both HzOR and HER, requiring -80 mV and -9 mV respectively to reach 10 mA cm-2. Theoretical and experimental insights confirm the importance of two Ru species for bifunctionality: NCs enhance the conductivity, and its coexistence with SA balances the H adsorption for HER and facilitates the initial dehydrogenation during the HzOR. In the overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) system, &#945;-MoC/N-C/RuNSA excels as both anode and cathode materials, achieving 10 mA cm-2 at just 64 mV. The zinc hydrazine (Zn-Hz) battery assembled with &#945;-MoC/N-C/RuNSA cathode and Zn foil anode can exhibit 96% energy efficiency, as well as temporary separation of hydrogen gas during the discharge process. Therefore, integrating Zn-Hz with OHzS system enables self-powered H2 evolution, even in hydrazine sewage. Overall, the amalgamation of NCs with SA achieves diverse catalytic activities for yielding multifold hydrogen gas through advanced cell-integrated-electrolyzer system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Advances in Environmentally Friendly Dual&#8208;crosslinking Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Environmentally friendly dual&#8208;crosslinking polymer networks (EF&#8208;DCPNs) emerge as breakthrough solutions to address the trade&#8208;off between mechanical robustness and dynamic behaviors, while greatly eliminating environmental impacts. This review summarizes current status of synthesis, properties, and applications of EF&#8208;DCPNs and provides perspectives on the future development in this important field.







Abstract
Environmentally friendly crosslinked polymer networks feature degradable covalent or non&#8208;covalent bonds, with many of them manifesting dynamic characteristics. These attributes enable convenient degradation, facile reprocessibility, and self&#8208;healing capabilities. However, the inherent instability of these crosslinking bonds often compromises the mechanical properties of polymer networks, limiting their practical applications. In this context, environmentally friendly dual&#8208;crosslinking polymer networks (denoted EF&#8208;DCPNs) have emerged as promising alternatives to address this challenge. These materials effectively balance the need for high mechanical properties with the ability to degrade, recycle, and/or self&#8208;heal. Despite their promising potential, investigations into EF&#8208;DCPNs remain in their nascent stages, and several gaps and limitations persist. This Review provides a comprehensive overview of the synthesis, properties, and applications of recent progress in EF&#8208;DCPNs. Firstly, synthetic routes to a rich variety of EF&#8208;DCPNs possessing two distinct types of dynamic bonds (i.e., imine, disulfide, ester, hydrogen bond, coordination bond, and other bonds) are introduced. Subsequently, complex structure&#8208; and dynamic nature&#8208;dependent mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties of EF&#8208;DCPNs are discussed, followed by their exemplary applications in electronics and biotechnology. Finally, future research directions in this rapidly evolving field are outlined.

         <title>Boost the Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence of Chiral Organometallic Platinum Complexes by Hierarchical Assembly into Fibrillar Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thin films of chiral Pt(II) complexes exhibit giantly&#8208;amplified circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with |glum| of 0.53 at 560&#8197;nm and &#934; of ~50&#8201;% in air, as a result of the hierarchical formation of crystalline fibrillar networks upon spin coating. These films display promising potentials in CPL&#8208;contrast imaging and inducing circularly polarized light generation from achiral emitters and common LED lamps.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active molecular materials have drawn increasing attention due to their promising applications for next&#8208;generation display and optoelectronic technologies. Currently, it is challenging to obtain CPL materials with both large luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) and high quantum yield (&#934;). A pair of enantiomeric N&#8201;N&#8201;C&#8208;type Pt(II) complexes (L/D)&#8208;1 modified with chiral Leucine methyl ester are presented herein. Though the solutions of these complexes are CPL&#8208;inactive, the spin&#8208;coated thin films of (L/D)&#8208;1 exhibit giantly&#8208;amplified circularly polarized phosphorescences with |glum| of 0.53 at 560&#8197;nm and &#934;air of ~50&#8201;%, as well as appealing circular dichroism (CD) signals with the maximum absorption dissymmetry factor |gabs| of 0.37&#8211;0.43 at 480&#8197;nm. This superior CPL performance benefits from the hierarchical formation of crystalline fibrillar networks upon spin coating. Comparative studies of another pair of chiral Pt(II) complexes (L/D)&#8208;2 with a symmetric N&#8201;C&#8201;N coordination mode suggest that the asymmetric N&#8201;N&#8201;C coordination of (L/D)&#8208;1 are favorable for the efficient exciton delocalization to amplify the CPL performance. Optical applications of the thin films of (L/D)&#8208;1 in CPL&#8208;contrast imaging and inducing CP light generation from achiral emitters and common light&#8208;emitting diode lamps have been successfully realized.

         <title>Construct Phenylethanoid Glycosides Harnessing Biosynthetic Networks, Protein Engineering and One&#8208;Pot Multienzyme Cascades</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot multienzyme cascade platform was established to synthesize various phenylethanoid glycosides (PhGs). In total 12 catalytic enzymes were characterized to illustrate a complex biosynthetic network; 3&#8197;enzymes were engineered to broaden sugar donor and substrate selectivity; 46&#8197;PhGs could be constructed. PhGs with additional glycosyl and hydroxyl modules demonstrated liver cell protection effect.







Abstract
Phenylethanoid glycosides (PhGs) exhibit a multitude of structural variations linked to diverse pharmacological activities. Assembling various PhGs via multienzyme cascades represents a concise strategy over traditional synthetic methods. However, the challenge lies in identifying a comprehensive set of catalytic enzymes. This study explores biosynthetic PhG reconstruction from natural precursors, aiming to replicate and amplify their structural diversity. We discovered 12 catalytic enzymes, including four novel 6&#8242;&#8208;OH glycosyltransferases and three new polyphenol oxidases, revealing the intricate network in PhG biosynthesis. Subsequently, the crystal structure of CmGT3 (2.62&#8197;&#197;) was obtained, guiding the identification of conserved residue 144# as a critical determinant for sugar donor specificity. Engineering this residue in PhG glycosyltransferases (FsGT61, CmGT3, and FsGT6) altered their sugar donor recognition. Finally, a one&#8208;pot multienzyme cascade was established, where the combined action of glycosyltransferases and acyltransferases boosted conversion rates by up to 12.6&#8208;fold. This cascade facilitated the reconstruction of 26&#8197;PhGs with conversion rates ranging from 5&#8211;100&#8201;%, and 20 additional PhGs detectable by mass spectrometry. PhGs with extra glycosyl and hydroxyl modules demonstrated notable liver cell protection. This work not only provides catalytic tools for PhG biosynthesis, but also serves as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for cell&#8208;free enzymatic construction of diverse natural products.

         <title>Tuning Electron Delocalization of Redox&#8208;Active Porous Aromatic Framework for Low&#8208;Temperature Aqueous Zn&#8722;K Hybrid Batteries with Air Self&#8208;Chargeability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate the first case of applying redox&#8208;active porous organic polymer for aqueous Zn&#8722;K hybrid batteries with air self&#8208;chargeability, presenting a redox chemistry with K+ as the charge carriers and regulates Zn&#8208;ion solvation chemistry to guide uniform Zn plating/stripping, thus showing the impressively electrochemical properties in bending, all&#8208;climate and air self&#8208;charging conditions.







Abstract
Air self&#8208;charging aqueous batteries promise to integrate energy harvesting technology and battery systems, potentially overcoming a heavy reliance on energy and the spatiotemporal environment. However, the exploitation of multifunctional air self&#8208;charging battery systems using promising cathode materials and suitable charge carriers remains challenging. Herein, for the first time, we developed low&#8208;temperature self&#8208;charging aqueous Zn&#8722;K hybrid ion batteries (AZKHBs) using a fully conjugated hexaazanonaphthalene (HATN)&#8208;based porous aromatic framework as the cathode material, exhibiting redox chemistry using K+ as charge carriers, and regulating Zn&#8208;ion solvation chemistry to guide uniform Zn plating/stripping. The unique AZKHBs exhibit the exceptional electrochemical properties in all&#8208;climate conditions. Most importantly, the large potential difference causes the AZKHBs discharged cathode to be oxidized using oxygen, thereby initiating a self&#8208;charging process in the absence of an external power source. Impressively, the air self&#8208;charging AZKHBs can achieve a maximum voltage of 1.15&#8197;V, an impressive discharge capacity (466.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), and exceptional self&#8208;charging performance even at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. Therefore, the development of self&#8208;charging AZKHBs offers a solution to the limitations imposed by the absence of a power grid in harsh environments or remote areas.

         <title>A Dielectric MXene&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Built Electric Field in Polymer Electrolyte Triggering Fast Lithium&#8208;Ion Transport and High&#8208;Voltage Cycling Stability</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel self&#8208;built electric field strategy is proposed to enhance Li+ transportation and accelerate the degradation dynamics of LiTFSI by optimizing the termination of MXene, resulting in the formation of LiF&#8208;enriched SEI and CEI enhanced stable interfaces, as evidenced by XPS etching and ToF&#8208;SIMS. It showcases prolonged cycle life at a high voltage up to 4.6&#8197;V, showing promising applications for quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolytes.







Abstract
Quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte (QPE) lithium (Li)&#8208;metal battery holds significant promise in the application of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries, yet it suffers from low ionic conductivity and poor oxidation stability. Herein, a novel self&#8208;built electric field (SBEF) strategy is proposed to enhance Li+ transportation and accelerate the degradation dynamics of carbon&#8208;fluorine bond cleavage in LiTFSI by optimizing the termination of MXene. Among them, the SBEF induced by dielectric Nb4C3F2 MXene effectively constructs highly conductive LiF&#8208;enriched SEI and CEI stable interfaces, moreover, enhances the electrochemical performance of the QPE. The related Li&#8208;ion transfer mechanism and dual&#8208;reinforced stable interface are thoroughly investigated using ab initio molecular dynamics, COMSOL, XPS depth profiling, and ToF&#8208;SIMS. This comprehensive approach results in a high conductivity of 1.34&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1, leading to a small polarization of approximately 25&#8197;mV for Li//Li symmetric cell after 6000&#8197;h. Furthermore, it enables a prolonged cycle life at a high voltage of up to 4.6&#8197;V. Overall, this work not only broadens the application of MXene for QPE but also inspires the great potential of the self&#8208;built electric field in QPE&#8208;based high&#8208;voltage batteries.

         <title>Silica Confinement for Stable and Magnetic Co&#8722;Cu Alloy Nanoparticles in Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon for Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile yet effective spatial confinement strategy is proposed to construct high&#8208;efficiency catalysts through carbonizing a mesoporous silica&#8208;confined Co&#8722;Cu bimetal&#8211;organic framework for hydrogen evolution from AB hydrolysis. The optimized Co0.8Cu0.2@NC@mSiO2 catalyst exhibits superior activity, outstanding stability, and magnetic recyclability for hydrogen evolution from AB hydrolysis under extremely mild conditions.







Abstract
Ammonia borane (AB) with 19.6&#8197;wt&#8201;% H2 content is widely considered a safe and efficient medium for H2 storage and release. Co&#8208;based nanocatalysts present strong contenders for replacing precious metal&#8208;based catalysts in AB hydrolysis due to their high activity and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, precisely adjusting the active centers and surface properties of Co&#8208;based nanomaterials to enhance their activity, as well as suppressing the migration and loss of metal atoms to improve their stability, presents many challenges. In this study, mesoporous&#8208;silica&#8208;confined bimetallic Co&#8722;Cu nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (CoxCu1&#8722;x@NC@mSiO2) were synthesized using a facile mSiO2&#8208;confined thermal pyrolysis strategy. The obtained product, an optimized Co0.8Cu0.2@NC@mSiO2 catalyst, exhibits enhanced performance with a turnover frequency of 240.9&#8197;molH2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;molmetal&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;min&#8722;1 for AB hydrolysis at 298&#8197;K, surpassing most noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalysts. Moreover, Co0.8Cu0.2@NC@mSiO2 demonstrates magnetic recyclability and extraordinary stability, with a negligible decline of only 0.8&#8201;% over 30&#8197;cycles of use. This enhanced performance was attributed to the synergistic effect between Co and Cu, as well as silica confinement. This work proposes a promising method for constructing noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalysts for AB hydrolysis.

         <title>In situ/Operando Synchrotron Radiation Analytical Techniques for CO2/CO Reduction Reaction: From Atomic Scales to Mesoscales</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically introduces the cross&#8208;scale applications of synchrotron radiation technologies classified by radiation sources with varying wavelengths in CO(2)RR, covering electronic structure, atomic configuration, molecular adsorption, crystal structure, and devices, spanning from atomic scales to mesoscopic scales.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide/carbon monoxide reduction reaction (CO(2)RR) has emerged as a prospective and appealing strategy to realize carbon neutrality for manufacturing sustainable chemical products. Developing highly active electrocatalysts and stable devices has been demonstrated as effective approach to enhance the conversion efficiency of CO(2)RR. In order to rationally design electrocatalysts and devices, a comprehensive understanding of the intrinsic structure evolution within catalysts and micro&#8208;environment change around electrode interface, particularly under operation conditions, is indispensable. Synchrotron radiation has been recognized as a versatile characterization platform, garnering widespread attention owing to its high brightness, elevated flux, excellent directivity, strong polarization and exceptional stability. This review systematically introduces the applications of synchrotron radiation technologies classified by radiation sources with varying wavelengths in CO(2)RR. By virtue of in situ/operando synchrotron radiationanalytical techniques, we also summarize relevant dynamic evolution processes from electronic structure, atomic configuration, molecular adsorption, crystal lattice and devices, spanning scales from the angstrom to the micrometer. The merits and limitations of diverse synchrotron characterization techniques are summarized, and their applicable scenarios in CO(2)RR are further presented. On the basis of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art fourth&#8208;generation synchrotron facilities, a perspective for further deeper understanding of the CO(2)RR process using synchrotron radiation analytical techniques is proposed.

         <title>Molecular Engineering for Modulating Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution of Fully Conjugated 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of fully conjugated 3D covalent organic frameworks were synthesized by using the molecular engineering strategy. The influences of key factors including the D&#8208;A structure, hydrophilicity, porosity, as well as the conjugated/non&#8208;conjugated structures on their photocatalytic hydrogen evolution properties were discussed. The as&#8208;synthesized fully conjugated 3D COFs could generate H2 up to 40.36&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have recently shown great potential for photocatalytic hydrogen production. Currently almost all reports are focused on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COFs, while the 3D counterparts are rarely explored due to their non&#8208;conjugated frameworks derived from the sp3 carbon based tetrahedral building blocks. Here, we rationally designed and synthesized a series of fully conjugated 3D COFs by using the saddle&#8208;shaped cyclooctatetrathiophene derivative as the building block. Through molecular engineering strategies, we thoroughly discussed the influences of key factors including the donor&#8208;acceptor structure, hydrophilicity, specific surface areas, as well as the conjugated/non&#8208;conjugated structures on their photocatalytic hydrogen evolution properties. The as&#8208;synthesized fully conjugated 3D COFs could generate the hydrogen up to 40.36&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1. This is the first report on intrinsic metal&#8208;free 3D COFs in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution application. Our work provides insight on the structure design of 3D COFs for highly&#8208;efficient photocatalysis, and also reveals that the semiconducting fully conjugated 3D COFs could be a useful platform in clear energy&#8208;related fields.

         <title>A Fluorine&#8208;Effect&#8208;Enabled Photocatalytic 4&#8208;Exo&#8208;Trig Cyclization Cascade to Access Fluoroalkylated Cyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclobutanes are popular structural units in bioactive compounds and versatile intermediates in synthetic chemistry, but their synthesis is challenging owing to high ring strain. In this study, a novel method for highly regio&#8208; and diastereoselective synthesis of fluoroalkylcyclobutanes bearing vicinal quaternary and tertiary stereocenters is realized by a photocatalytic 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization cascade of thioalkynes or trifluoromethylalkenes. Density functional theory calculations reveal that a unique fluorine effect, arising from hyperconjugative &#960;&#8594;&#963;*C&#8208;F interactions, accounts for the regio&#8208;reversed radical addition at the sterically hindered alkene carbon, which facilitates an unprecedented 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig ring closure. This chemistry enables the direct and controllable construction of medicinally valuable quaternary&#8208;carbon&#8208;containing cyclobutanes from readily available raw materials, nicely complementing the existing methods.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A multifunctional photoinitiator is presented, offering precise control over light&#8208;induced polymerization initiation at 450 nm and material degradation at 365 nm. This is accomplished by covalently linking photoactive bis(acyl)phosphane oxide and photocleavable o&#8208;nitrobenzyl ether moieties onto the surface of &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin. Upon degradation, the resulting linear polymers can be easily re&#8208;dissolved in their corresponding monomer and re&#8208;cured, exhibiting superior mechanical properties compared to the pristine material. Moreover, this photoinitiator enables the successful 3D printing of intricate and precise structures, representing a promising general strategy for developing recyclable photoresins for 3D printing applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Macroscopic Superlattice Membranes Self&#8208;Assembled from Gold Nanobipyramids with Precisely Tunable Tip Arrangements for SERS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and efficient strategy is proposed to fabricate macroscopic two&#8208;dimensional superlattice (SL) membranes composed of Au nanobipyramids, the microstructure and tip arrangements of which can be precisely tailored by adjusting the amount of free ligands added during self&#8208;assembly. Among various SLs, the tip&#8208;on&#8208;tip SLs exhibit the highest enhancement factor for surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), reaching an impressive value of 1.95&#215;108, with uniform and consistent SERS signals across a large area.







Abstract
A persistent challenge in utilizing Au nanocrystals for surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) lies in achieving controllable superstructures that maximize SERS performance. Here, a novel strategy is proposed to enhance the SERS performance by precisely adjusting the tip arrangements of Au nanobipyramids (BPs) in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) superlattices (SLs). This is achieved through ligand&#8208;exchange of Au BPs, followed by liquid&#8208;air interfacial assembly, resulting in large&#8208;area, transferrable SL membranes. The key to controlling the arrangement of Au BPs in the SLs is the regulation of the amount of free ligands added during self&#8208;assembly, which allows for the precise formation of various configurations such as tilted SLs, tip&#8208;on&#8208;tip SLs, and tip&#8208;to&#8208;tip SLs. Among these configurations, tip&#8208;on&#8208;tip SLs exhibit the highest enhancement factor for SERS, reaching an impressive value of 1.95&#215;108, with uniform and consistent SERS signals across a large area. The experimental findings are further corroborated by simulations using the finite element method. This study establishes an efficient method for engineering the microstructure of 2D SLs composed of Au BPs, highlighting the importance of fine&#8208;tuning the tip arrangements of Au BPs to regulate SERS performance.

         <title>Network Polymer Properties Engineered Through Polymer Backbone Dispersity and Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer networks using chains of distinct backbone length variability were developed with control over both length and dispersity. The impact of primary chain length dispersity on material properties including strength, swelling, adhesion and extensibility were evaluated. Materials with intermediate primary chain dispersity showed superior materials properties.







Abstract
Dispersity (&#208; or Mw/Mn) is an important parameter in material design and as such can significantly impact the properties of polymers. Here, polymer networks with independent control over the molecular weight and dispersity of the linear chains that form the material are developed. Using a RAFT polymerization approach, a library of polymers with dispersity ranging from 1.2&#8212;1.9 for backbone chain&#8208;length (DP) 100, and 1.4&#8212;3.1 for backbone chain&#8208;length 200 were developed and transformed to networks through post&#8208;polymerization crosslinking to form disulfide linkers. The tensile, swelling, and adhesive properties were explored, finding that both at DP 100 and DP 200 the swelling ratio, tensile strength, and extensibility were superior at intermediate dispersity (1.3&#8212;1.5 for DP 100 and 1.6&#8212;2.1 for DP 200) compared to materials with either substantially higher or lower dispersity. Furthermore, adhesive properties for materials with chains of intermediate dispersity at DP 200 revealed enhanced performance compared to the very low or high dispersity chains.

         <title>Precisely Engineering Asymmetric Atomic CoN4 by Electron Donating and Extracting for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By coordinating cobalt salts and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligands with different substituents (phen(X), X=OH, CH3, H, Br, Cl) onto CTFs, a series of well&#8208;defined CoN4 centers were synthesized as model electrocatalysts. The experimental results proved a positive correlation between the electron&#8208;pushing ability of the substituent groups on the phen&#8208;based ligands and both the adsorption strength of the CoN4 centers on oxygen molecules and their ORR kinetic activity.







Abstract
The development of nonpyrolytic catalysts featuring precisely defined active sites represents an effective strategy for investigating the fundamental relationship between the catalytic activity of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts and their local coordination environments. In this study, we have synthesized a series of model electrocatalysts with well&#8208;defined CoN4 centers and nonplanar symmetric coordination structures. These catalysts were prepared by a sequential process involving the chelation of cobalt salts and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;based ligands with various substituent groups (phen(X), where X=OH, CH3, H, Br, Cl) onto covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs). By modulating the electron&#8208;donating or electron&#8208;withdrawing properties of the substituent groups on the phen&#8208;based ligands, the electron density surrounding the CoN4 centers was effectively controlled. Our results demonstrated a direct correlation between the catalytic activity of the CoN4 centers and the electron&#8208;donating ability of the substituent group on the phenanthroline ligands. Notably, the catalyst denoted as BCTF&#8722;Co&#8208;phen(OH), featuring the electron&#8208;donating OH group, exhibited the highest ORR catalytic activity. This custom&#8208;crafted catalyst achieved a remarkable half&#8208;wave potential of up to 0.80&#8197;V vs. RHE and an impressive turnover frequency (TOF) value of 47.4&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;Hz at 0.80&#8197;V vs. RHE in an alkaline environment.

&lt;p&gt;By coordinating cobalt salts and 1,10-phenanthroline ligands with different substituents (phen(X), X=OH, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, H, Br, Cl) onto CTFs, a series of well-defined CoN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; centers were synthesized as model electrocatalysts. The experimental results proved a positive correlation between the electron-pushing ability of the substituent groups on the phen-based ligands and both the adsorption strength of the CoN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; centers on oxygen molecules and their ORR kinetic activity.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of nonpyrolytic catalysts featuring precisely defined active sites represents an effective strategy for investigating the fundamental relationship between the catalytic activity of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts and their local coordination environments. In this study, we have synthesized a series of model electrocatalysts with well-defined CoN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; centers and nonplanar symmetric coordination structures. These catalysts were prepared by a sequential process involving the chelation of cobalt salts and 1,10-phenanthroline-based ligands with various substituent groups (phen(X), where X=OH, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, H, Br, Cl) onto covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs). By modulating the electron-donating or electron-withdrawing properties of the substituent groups on the phen-based ligands, the electron density surrounding the CoN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; centers was effectively controlled. Our results demonstrated a direct correlation between the catalytic activity of the CoN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; centers and the electron-donating ability of the substituent group on the phenanthroline ligands. Notably, the catalyst denoted as BCTF&#8722;Co-phen(OH), featuring the electron-donating OH group, exhibited the highest ORR catalytic activity. This custom-crafted catalyst achieved a remarkable half-wave potential of up to 0.80&#8197;V vs. RHE and an impressive turnover frequency (TOF) value of 47.4&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;Hz at 0.80&#8197;V vs. RHE in an alkaline environment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Attenuating N&#8208;Oxyl Decomposition for Improved Hydrogen Atom Transfer Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>

This work details a new N&#8208;oxyl scaffold that is a promising hydrogen atom transfer catalyst. Although the conventional N&#8208;oxyl catalyst design within the phthalimide&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl scaffold provides modest improvement on either reactivity or stability, the increase of one parameter often strongly impacts the other. For the first time, we found that within hydantoin&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl scaffold, the N&#8208;oxyl persistence can be increased without sacrificing reactivity.







Abstract
The design of N&#8208;oxyl hydrogen atom transfer catalysts has proven challenging to date. Previous efforts have focused on the functionalization of the archetype, phthalimide&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl. Driven in part by the limited options for modification of this structure, this strategy has provided only modest improvements in reactivity and/or solubility. Our previous mechanistic efforts suggested that while the electron&#8208;withdrawing carbonyls of the phthalimide are necessary to maximize the O&#8722;H bond dissociation enthalpy of the HAT product hydroxylamine and overall reaction thermodynamics, they undergo nucleophilic substitution leading to catalyst decomposition. In an attempt to minimize this vulnerability, we report the characterization of N&#8208;oxyl catalysts wherein the aryl ring in PINO is replaced with the combination of a substituted heteroatom and quaternary carbon. By rendering one carbonyl carbon less electrophilic and the other less sterically accessible, the corresponding N1&#8208;aryl&#8208;hydantoin&#8208;N3&#8208;oxyl radical showed significantly higher stability than PINO as well as a modest improvement in reactivity. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle in new scaffold design may accelerate future HAT catalyst discovery and development.

         <title>The Use of Xenonucleic Acids Significantly Reduces the In Vivo Drift of Electrochemical Aptamer&#8208;Based Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical aptamer&#8208;based (EAB) sensors made with DNA support high&#8208;frequency, real&#8208;time monitoring of molecules&#8208;of&#8208;interest in vivo. However, to use these sensors for long durations requires their signal to remain stable overtime. Here, we show that, in the living body, enzymatic cleavage of the sensor's DNA aptamer is a major source of signal loss and that this can be reduced by replacing it with an enzyme resistant xeno nucleic acid.







Abstract
Electrochemical aptamer&#8208;based sensors support the high&#8208;frequency, real&#8208;time monitoring of molecules&#8208;of&#8208;interest in vivo. Achieving this requires methods for correcting the sensor drift seen during in vivo placements. While this correction ensures EAB sensor measurements remain accurate, as drift progresses it reduces the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio and precision. Here, we show that enzymatic cleavage of the sensor's target&#8208;recognizing DNA aptamer is a major source of this signal loss. To demonstrate this, we deployed a tobramycin&#8208;detecting EAB sensor analog fabricated with the DNase&#8208;resistant &#8220;xenonucleic acid&#8221; 2&#8217;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;RNA in a live rat. In contrast to the sensor employing the equivalent DNA aptamer, the 2&#8217;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;RNA aptamer sensor lost very little signal and had improved signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise. We further characterized the EAB sensor drift using unstructured DNA or 2&#8217;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;RNA oligonucleotides. While the two devices drift similarly in vitro in whole blood, the in vivo drift of the 2&#8217;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;RNA&#8208;employing device is less compared to the DNA&#8208;employing device. Studies of the electron transfer kinetics suggested that the greater drift of the latter sensor arises due to enzymatic DNA degradation. These findings, coupled with advances in the selection of aptamers employing XNA, suggest a means of improving EAB sensor stability when they are used to perform molecular monitoring in the living body.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Network Breakdown Boosts Selective CO2 Photoreduction by Suppressing H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we discover that breaking down the hydrogen bond network can suppress the H2 evolution side reaction in CO2 photoreduction, leading to improved CO production. We design a series of photosensitive poly(ionic liquid)s as photocatalysts to study the effect of hydrogen bond network on CO2 photoreduction. The optimized CO rate and selectivity are 35.4&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and 98.9&#8201;%, respectively, with no H2 detected.







Abstract
Conventional strategies for highly efficient and selective CO2 photoreduction focus on the design of catalysts and cocatalysts. In this study, we discover that hydrogen bond network breakdown in reaction system can suppress H2 evolution, thereby improving CO2 photoreduction performance. Photosensitive poly(ionic liquid)s are designed as photocatalysts owing to their strong hydrogen bonding with solvents. The hydrogen bond strength is tuned by solvent composition, thereby effectively regulating H2 evolution (from 0 to 12.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). No H2 is detected after hydrogen bond network breakdown with trichloromethane or tetrachloromethane as additives. CO production rate and selectivity increase to 35.4&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and 98.9&#8201;% with trichloromethane, compared with 0.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and 26.2&#8201;%, respectively, without trichloromethane. Raman spectroscopy and theoretical calculations confirm that trichloromethane broke the systemic hydrogen bond network and subsequently suppressed H2 evolution. This hydrogen bond network breakdown strategy may be extended to other catalytic reactions involving H2 evolution.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Characterization and Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Alzheimer's Disease&#8208;Relevant Tau Aggregates in Human Samples</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing MAPTau, a novel single&#8208;molecule approach for detailed analysis of tau aggregates in human brain and blood, offering unprecedented insights into the quantity, size, and phosphorylation profile of individual tau aggregates. By identifying distinctive Alzheimer's disease&#8208;specific tau aggregate morphologies and phosphorylation patterns, MAPTau opens new avenues for investigating disease mechanisms and novel diagnostic strategies.







Abstract
Hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of the protein tau play key roles in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). While the molecular structure of the filamentous tau aggregates has been determined to atomic resolution, there is far less information available about the smaller, soluble aggregates, which are believed to be more toxic. Traditional techniques are limited to bulk measures and struggle to identify individual aggregates in complex biological samples. To address this, we developed a novel single&#8208;molecule pull&#8208;down&#8208;based assay (MAPTau) to detect and characterize individual tau aggregates in AD and control post&#8208;mortem brain and biofluids. Using MAPTau, we report the quantity, as well as the size and circularity of tau aggregates measured using super&#8208;resolution microscopy, revealing AD&#8208;specific differences in tau aggregate morphology. By adapting MAPTau to detect multiple phosphorylation markers in individual aggregates using two&#8208;color coincidence detection, we derived compositional profiles of the individual aggregates. We find an AD&#8208;specific phosphorylation profile of tau aggregates with more than 80&#8201;% containing multiple phosphorylations, compared to 5&#8201;% in age&#8208;matched non&#8208;AD controls. Our results show that MAPTau is able to identify disease&#8208;specific subpopulations of tau aggregates phosphorylated at different sites, that are invisible to other methods and enable the study of disease mechanisms and diagnosis.

&lt;p&gt;Introducing MAPTau, a novel single-molecule approach for detailed analysis of tau aggregates in human brain and blood, offering unprecedented insights into the quantity, size, and phosphorylation profile of individual tau aggregates. By identifying distinctive Alzheimer's disease-specific tau aggregate morphologies and phosphorylation patterns, MAPTau opens new avenues for investigating disease mechanisms and novel diagnostic strategies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of the protein tau play key roles in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). While the molecular structure of the filamentous tau aggregates has been determined to atomic resolution, there is far less information available about the smaller, soluble aggregates, which are believed to be more toxic. Traditional techniques are limited to bulk measures and struggle to identify individual aggregates in complex biological samples. To address this, we developed a novel single-molecule pull-down-based assay (MAPTau) to detect and characterize individual tau aggregates in AD and control post-mortem brain and biofluids. Using MAPTau, we report the quantity, as well as the size and circularity of tau aggregates measured using super-resolution microscopy, revealing AD-specific differences in tau aggregate morphology. By adapting MAPTau to detect multiple phosphorylation markers in individual aggregates using two-color coincidence detection, we derived compositional profiles of the individual aggregates. We find an AD-specific phosphorylation profile of tau aggregates with more than 80&#8201;% containing multiple phosphorylations, compared to 5&#8201;% in age-matched non-AD controls. Our results show that MAPTau is able to identify disease-specific subpopulations of tau aggregates phosphorylated at different sites, that are invisible to other methods and enable the study of disease mechanisms and diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Theoretical Prediction Leads to Synthesize GDY Supported InOx Quantum Dots for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The target catalysts with high activity and selectivity towards CO2RR were predicted by integrating DFT calculations and high&#8208;throughput screening and by using GDY supported QDs as the ideal model, which presents an effective strategy for rational design of new heterostructure electrocatalysts to achieve highly efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion.







Abstract
The preparation of formic acid by direct reduction of carbon dioxide is an important basis for the future chemical industry and is of great significance. Due to the serious shortage of highly active and selective electrocatalysts leading to the development of direct reduction of carbon dioxide is limited. Herein the target catalysts with high CO2RR activity and selectivity were identified by integrating DFT calculations and high&#8208;throughput screening and by using graphdiyne (GDY) supported metal oxides quantum dots (QDs) as the ideal model. It is theoretically predicted that GDY supported indium oxide QDs (i.e., InOx/GDY) is a new heterostructure electrocatalyst candidate with optimal CO2RR performance. The interfacial electronic strong interactions effectively regulate the surface charge distribution of QDs and affect the adsorption/desorption behavior of HCOO* intermediate during CO2RR to achieve highly efficient CO2 conversion. Based on the predicted composition and structure, we synthesized the advanced catalytic system, and demonstrates superior CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion performance. The study presents an effective strategy for rational design of highly efficient heterostructure electrocatalysts to promote green chemical production.

         <title>A Fast&#8208;Charge Graphite Anode with a Li&#8208;Ion&#8208;Conductive, Electron/Solvent&#8208;Repelling Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Application of a MoOx&#8722;MoNx (MoON) layer onto the conventional graphite (Gr) surface enables formation of a Li+&#8208;permeable, solvent&#8208;/electron&#8208;repelled anode&#8208;electrolyte interface in a rechargeable Li&#8208;ion battery, which is beneficial for achieving &#8220;kinetically stable&#8221; mass and charge transfer across the interface during fast Li&#8208;ion (de)intercalation and building of a 10&#8208;min&#8208;rechargeable battery with a long cycle life.







Abstract
Graphite has been serving as the key anode material of rechargeable Li&#8208;ion batteries, yet is difficultly charged within a quarter hour while maintaining stable electrochemistry. In addition to a defective edge structure that prevents fast Li&#8208;ion entry, the high&#8208;rate performance of graphite could be hampered by co&#8208;intercalation and parasitic reduction of solvent molecules at anode/electrolyte interface. Conventional surface modification by pitch&#8208;derived carbon barely isolates the solvent and electrons, and usually lead to inadequate rate capability to meet practical fast&#8208;charge requirements. Here we show that, by applying a MoOx&#8722;MoNx layer onto graphite surface, the interface allows fast Li&#8208;ion diffusion yet blocks solvent access and electron leakage. By regulating interfacial mass and charge transfer, the modified graphite anode delivers a reversible capacity of 340.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 4000&#8197;cycles at 6&#8197;C, showing promises in building 10&#8208;min&#8208;rechargeable batteries with a long operation life.

         <title>Gain of Function Recyclable Photoswitches: Reversible Simultaneous Substitution and Photochromism Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concept for the simultaneous functionalization and gain of photoswitching capability has been developed. By using reversible aniline alkylation as a functionalization strategy, a symmetric non&#8208;photochromic precursor is converted into a capable photoswitch with visible and red&#8208;light responsiveness. Upon heating, the alkylation is reversed and the symmetric precursor can be recycled and used for a different functionalization/photoswitch generation round.







Abstract
The use of molecular photoswitches has spread to virtually every field of pure and applied chemistry because of the extraordinary level of control they provide over the behavior of matter at the smallest scales. Photoswitches possess at least two different states with distinct structures and/or electronics and further functionalization of their core chromophore structures is needed to tailor them for a specific application. In this work we present a different concept for the generation and use of molecular photoswitches. It allows not only simultaneous establishment of photochromism and functionalization, but also full recyclability of a non&#8208;photochromic precursor material. Using a high&#8208;yielding and reversible ammonium salt formation, a functional group is introduced into a symmetric precursor while at the same time a strong electronic push&#8208;pull character is established in the structure. The resulting desymmetrization leads to efficient photoswitching capacity and the functional group can be fully removed subsequently by a simple heating step recovering the precursor for another functionalization round. We finally demonstrate feasibility of this concept over two consecutive closed loop functionalization/photoswitching/recovery steps. This concept offers great potential in any chemical research and application driven area but especially for the creation of responsive reprogrammable materials, no&#8208;background photoswitch labeling, and sustainable chemistry.

         <title>Synergistic Ni&#8722;W Dimer Sites Induced Stable Compressive Strain for Boosting the Performance of Pt as Electrocatalyst for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni&#8722;W dimer atoms on the Pt surface was prepared by atomic layer deposition method. The compressive strain induced by the stable dimer structure modulated Pt electronic structure and thus enhanced oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
Alloying Pt catalysts with transition metal elements is an effective pathway to enhance the performance of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), but often accompanied with severe metal dissolution issue, resulting in poor stability of alloy catalysts. Here, instead of forming traditional alloy structure, we modify Pt surface with a novel Ni&#8722;W dimer structure by the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique. The obtained NiW@PtC catalyst exhibits superior ORR performance both in liquid half&#8208;cell and practical fuel cell compared with initial Pt/C. It is discovered that strong synergistic Ni&#8722;W dimer structure arising from short atomic distance induced a stable compressive strain on the Pt surface, thus boosting Pt catalytic performance. This surface modification by synergistic dimer sites offers an effective strategy in tailoring Pt with excellent activity and stability, which provides a significant perspective in boosting the performance of commercial Pt catalyst modified with polymetallic atom sites.

         <title>Crystal Engineering of MOF&#8208;Derived Bimetallic Oxide Solid Solution Anchored with Au Nanoparticles for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Syngas and C2 Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>

Through crystal engineering and MOF derivation, the Zr/Ti bimetallic oxide solid solution anchored with Au nanoparticles can be elaborately designed and synthesized to integrate multiple active sites, achieving photocatalytic CO2 reduction to syngas and eventually C2 hydrocarbons under simulated solar light irradiation.







Abstract
Considering that CO2 reduction is mostly a multielectron reaction, it is necessary for the photocatalysts to integrate multiple catalytic sites and cooperate synergistically to achieve efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction to various products, such as C2 hydrocarbons. Herein, through crystal engineering, we designed and constructed a metal&#8211;organic framework&#8208;derived Zr/Ti bimetallic oxide solid solution support, which was confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction, electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. After anchoring Au nanoparticles, the composite photocatalyst exhibited excellent performances toward photocatalytic CO2 reduction to syngas (H2 and CO production rates of 271.6 and 260.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and even C2 hydrocarbons (C2H4 and C2H6 production rates of 6.80 and 4.05&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). According to the control experiments and theoretical calculations, the strong interaction between bimetallic oxide solid solution support and Au nanoparticles was found to be beneficial for binding intermediates and reducing CO2 reduction, highlighting the synergy effect of the catalytic system with multiple active sites.

         <title>Triplet&#8208;Triplet Energy Transfer: A Simple Strategy for an Efficient Visible Light&#8208;Induced Photoclick Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient triplet&#8208;sensitized photoclick reactions of 9,10&#8208;phenanthrenequinone with electron&#8208;rich alkenes is introduced. Photocycloadditions are achieved at low concentrations of triplet photosensitizers under green or orange light, exhibiting a significant bathochromic shift of over 100&#8197;nm compared to conventional systems. This method enables precise control of product distribution using orthogonal blue and green light&#8208;induced photoclick reactions.







Abstract
Photoclick reactions combine the advantages offered by light&#8208;driven processes and classical click chemistry and have found applications ranging from surface functionalization, polymer conjugation, photo&#8208;crosslinking, and protein labeling. Despite these advances, the dependency of most of the photoclick reactions on UV light poses a severe obstacle for their general implementation, as this light can be absorbed by other molecules in the system resulting in their degradation or unwanted reactivity. However, the development of a simple and efficient system to achieve bathochromically shifted photoclick transformations remains challenging. Here, we introduce triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer as a fast and selective way to enable visible light&#8208;induced photoclick reactions. Specifically, we show that 9,10&#8208;phenanthrenequinones (PQs) can efficiently react with electron&#8208;rich alkenes (ERAs) in the presence of a catalytic amount (as little as 5&#8197;mol&#8201;%) of photosensitizers. The photocycloaddition reaction can be achieved under green (530&#8197;nm) or orange (590&#8197;nm) light irradiation, representing a bathochromic shift of over 100&#8197;nm as compared to the classical PQ&#8208;ERAs system. Furthermore, by combining appropriate reactants, we establish an orthogonal, blue and green light&#8208;induced photoclick reaction system in which the product distribution can be precisely controlled by the choice of the color of light.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Dense Supported Ruthenium Oxide Clusters via Directed Ion Exchange for Efficient Valorization of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;dense supported Ru oxide clusters prepared by directed ion exchange enable the efficient deep electrochemical oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (5&#8208;HMF) into 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) under neutral conditions.







Abstract
Maximizing the loadings of active centers without aggregation for a supported catalyst is a grand challenge but essential for achieving high gravimetric catalytic activity, especially toward multi&#8208;step reactions. The oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), a key biomass&#8208;derived platform molecule, into 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), a promising alternative to polyester monomer, is such a multi&#8208;step reaction that involves 6 proton and electron transfers. This process often demands strong alkaline environment but also suffers from the alkali&#8208;driven polymerization side&#8208;reaction. Meanwhile, neutral media ameliorates the polymerization, but lacks efficient catalyst toward deep oxidation. Herein, we devised a strategy of creating ultra&#8208;dense supported Ru oxide clusters via directed ion exchange in a Co hydroxyanion (CoHA) support material. Pyrimidine ligands were first incorporated into the CoHA interlayers, and the subsequent evacuation of pyrimidines created porous channels for the directed ion exchange with the built&#8208;in anions in CoHA, which allowed the dense and mono&#8208;disperse functionalization of RuCl62&#8722; anions and their resulting Ru oxide clusters. These ultra&#8208;dense Ru oxide clusters not only enable high HMF electrooxidation currents under neutral conditions but also create microscopic channels in&#8208;between the clusters for the expedited re&#8208;adsorption and oxidation of intermediates toward highly oxidized product, such as 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;2&#8208;furoic acid (FFCA) and FDCA. A two&#8208;stage HMF oxidation process, consisting of ambient conversion of HMF into FFCA and FFCA oxidation into FDCA under 60&#8201;&#176;C, was eventually developed to first achieve a high FDCA yield of 92.1&#8201;% under neutral media with significantly reduced polymerization.

         <title>A Tandem&#8208;Locked Chemiluminescent Probe for Imaging of Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophage Polarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrophilic tandem&#8208;locked probe based on a highly efficient chemiluminophore is developed to only activate chemiluminescent signal in the presence of both tumour and M1 macrophage biomarkers, enabling monitoring tumor&#8208;associated macrophage polarization.







Abstract
Tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) play a role in both pro&#8208; and anti&#8208;tumor functions; and the targeted polarization from M2 to M1 TAMs has become an effective therapy option. Although detection of M1 TAMs is imperative to assess cancer immunotherapeutic efficacy, existing optical probes suffer from shallow tissue penetration depth and poor specificity toward M1 TAMs. Herein, we report a tandem&#8208;locked NIR chemiluminescent (CL) probe for specific detection of M1 TAMs. Through a combined molecular engineering approach via both atomic alternation and introduction of electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, near&#8208;infrared (NIR) chemiluminophores are screened out to possess record&#8208;long emission (over 800&#8197;nm), record&#8208;high CL quantum yield (2.7&#8201;% einstein/mol), and prolonged half&#8208;life (7.7&#8197;h). Based on an ideal chemiluminophore, the tandem&#8208;locked probe (DPDGN) is developed to only activate CL signal in the presence of both tumour (&#947;&#8208;glutamyl transpeptidase) and M1 macrophage biomarkers (nitric oxide). Such a tandem&#8208;lock design ensures its high specificity towards M1 macrophages in the tumor microenvironment over those in normal tissues or peripheral blood. Thus, DPDGN permits noninvasive imaging and tracking of M1 TAM in the tumor of living mice during R837 treatment, showing a good correlation with ex vivo methods. This study not only reports a new molecular approach towards highly efficient chemiluminophores but also reveals the first tandem&#8208;locked CL probes for enhanced imaging specificity.

         <title>A Tag&#8208;Free Platform for Synthesis and Screening of Cyclic Peptide Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The platform PEPTIC for cyclic peptide drug discovery offers a tag&#8208;free workflow for the synthesis, sequencing, and identification of cyclic peptide binders. This innovative approach enables the generation of diverse cyclic peptide libraries, as well as facile linearization and decoding of cyclic peptide binder sequences, and is expected to expedite the discovery of novel cyclic peptide binders of biological targets.







Abstract
In the realm of high&#8208;throughput screening (HTS), macrocyclic peptide libraries traditionally necessitate decoding tags, essential for both library synthesis and identifying hit peptide sequences post&#8208;screening. Our innovation introduces a tag&#8208;free technology platform for synthesizing cyclic peptide libraries in solution and facilitates screening against biological targets to identify peptide binders through unconventional intramolecular CyClick and DeClick chemistries (CCDC) discovered through our research. This combination allows for the synthesis of diverse cyclic peptide libraries, the incorporation of various amino acids, and facile linearization and decoding of cyclic peptide binder sequences. Our sensitivity&#8208;enhancing derivatization method, utilized in tandem with nano LC&#8208;MS/MS, enables the sequencing of peptides even at exceedingly low picomolar concentrations. Employing our technology platform, we have successfully unearthed novel cyclic peptide binders against a monoclonal antibody and the first cyclic peptide binder of HIV capsid protein responsible for viral infections as validated by microscale thermal shift assays (TSA), biolayer interferometry (BLI) and functional assays.

         <title>Stereodivergent, Kinetically Controlled Isomerization of Terminal Alkenes via Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nickel&#8208;catalyzed kinetic alkene mono&#8208;transposition generates E&#8208; or Z&#8208;olefins depending on the steric properties and denticity of the ligand employed. Mechanistic studies reveal that the aryl iodide additive acts as a redox buffer for nickel in the Z&#8208;selective reaction, generating the most&#8208;selective NiII&#8211;H that outcompetes a less Z&#8208;selective NiI&#8211;H species. For the E&#8208;selective reaction, the phosphonium salt plays a dual role as an acid and ligand, forming a phosphine&#8208;bound cationic Ni&#8722;H catalyst in situ.







Abstract
Because internal alkenes are more challenging synthetic targets than terminal alkenes, metal&#8208;catalyzed olefin mono&#8208;transposition (i.e., positional isomerization) approaches have emerged to afford valuable E&#8208; or Z&#8208; internal alkenes from their complementary terminal alkene feedstocks. However, the applicability of these methods has been hampered by lack of generality, commercial availability of precatalysts, and scalability. Here, we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed platform for the stereodivergent E/Z&#8208;selective synthesis of internal alkenes at room temperature. Commercial reagents enable this one&#8208;carbon transposition of terminal alkenes to valuable E&#8208; or Z&#8208;internal alkenes via a Ni&#8722;H&#8208;mediated insertion/elimination mechanism. Though the mechanistic regime is the same in both systems, the underlying pathways that lead to each of the active catalysts are distinct, with the Z&#8208;selective catalyst forming from comproportionation of an oxidative addition complex followed by oxidative addition with substrate and the E&#8208;selective catalyst forming from protonation of the metal by the trialkylphosphonium salt additive. In each case, ligand sterics and denticity control stereochemistry and prevent over&#8208;isomerization.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Spontaneous Electropolymerization Enables Robust Hydrogel Electrolyte Interfaces in Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ electropolymerization strategy is introduced to form robust hydrogel electrolyte interfaces in aqueous batteries. This approach effectively enhances the interface stability between electrodes and hydrogel, concurrently stabilizing zinc metal anodes and facilitating the charge transfer on the rough cathode.







Abstract
Hydrogels hold great promise as electrolytes for emerging aqueous batteries, for which establishing a robust electrode&#8208;hydrogel interface is crucial for mitigating side reactions. Conventional hydrogel electrolytes fabricated by ex situ polymerization through either thermal stimulation or photo exposure cannot ensure complete interfacial contact with electrodes. Herein, we introduce an in situ electropolymerization approach for constructing hydrogel electrolytes. The hydrogel is spontaneously generated during the initial cycling of the battery, eliminating the need of additional initiators for polymerization. The involvement of electrodes during the hydrogel synthesis yields well&#8208;bonded and deep infiltrated electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces. As a case study, we attest that, the in situ&#8208;formed polyanionic hydrogel in Zn&#8208;MnO2 battery substantially improves the stability and kinetics of both Zn anode and porous MnO2 cathode owing to the robust interfaces. This research provides insight to the function of hydrogel electrolyte interfaces and constitutes a critical advancement in designing highly durable aqueous batteries.

         <title>ATP&#8208;Independent Turnover of Dinitrogen Intermediates Captured on the Nitrogenase Cofactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The N2 species captured asymmetrically at the two cofactors of the Azotobacter vinelandii Mo&#8208;nitrogenase (designated Av1*) can be distinguished upon ATP&#8208;independent, EuII/SO32&#8722;&#8208;driven turnover under H2, where the non&#8208;hydrogenated N2 species (presumably bound at one cofactor belt&#8208;sulfur site, S3A) is displaced by H2 and the hydrogenated N2* species (presumably bound at the other two cofactor belt&#8208;sulfur sites, S2B and S5A) are reduced to NH3.







Abstract
Nitrogenase reduces N2 to NH3 at its active&#8208;site cofactor. Previous studies of an N2&#8208;bound Mo&#8208;nitrogenase from Azotobacter vinelandii suggest binding of three N2 species via asymmetric belt&#8208;sulfur displacements in the two cofactors of its catalytic component (designated Av1*), leading to the proposal of stepwise N2 reduction involving all cofactor belt&#8208;sulfur sites; yet, the evidence for the existence of multiple N2 species on Av1* remains elusive. Here we report a study of ATP&#8208;independent, EuII/SO32&#8722;&#8208;driven turnover of Av1* using GC&#8208;MS and frequency&#8208;selective pulse NMR techniques. Our data demonstrate incorporation of D2&#8208;derived D by Av1* into the products of C2H2&#8208; and H+&#8208;reduction, and decreased formation of NH3 by Av1* concomitant with the release of N2 under H2; moreover, they reveal a strict dependence of these activities on SO32&#8722;. These observations point to the presence of distinct N2 species on Av1*, thereby providing strong support for our proposed mechanism of stepwise reduction of N2 via belt&#8208;sulfur mobilization.

         <title>Weakly Coordinating Diluent Modulated Solvation Chemistry for High&#8208;Performance Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel diluent&#8208;participated solvation electrolyte is designed to afford a new path to advanced electrolyte engineering. By introducing the weak solvation diluent to incorporate into the Na+ solvation structure, the electrolyte exhibits improved ionic conductivity, low desolvation energy, excellent oxidation resistance, high safety, and highly robust and conductive EEI films with superior electrochemical performances.







Abstract
Diluents have been extensively employed to overcome the disadvantages of high viscosity and sluggish kinetics of high&#8208;concentration electrolytes, but generally do not change the pristine solvation structure. Herein, a weakly coordinating diluent, hexafluoroisopropyl methyl ether (HFME), is applied to regulate the coordination of Na+ with diglyme and anion and form a diluent&#8208;participated solvate. This unique solvation structure promotes the accelerated decomposition of anions and diluents, with the construction of robust inorganic&#8208;rich electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphases. In addition, the introduction of HFME reduces the desolvation energy of Na+, improves ionic conductivity, strengthens the antioxidant, and enhances the safety of the electrolyte.

&lt;p&gt;A novel diluent-participated solvation electrolyte is designed to afford a new path to advanced electrolyte engineering. By introducing the weak solvation diluent to incorporate into the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; solvation structure, the electrolyte exhibits improved ionic conductivity, low desolvation energy, excellent oxidation resistance, high safety, and highly robust and conductive EEI films with superior electrochemical performances.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diluents have been extensively employed to overcome the disadvantages of high viscosity and sluggish kinetics of high-concentration electrolytes, but generally do not change the pristine solvation structure. Herein, a weakly coordinating diluent, hexafluoroisopropyl methyl ether (HFME), is applied to regulate the coordination of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; with diglyme and anion and form a diluent-participated solvate. This unique solvation structure promotes the accelerated decomposition of anions and diluents, with the construction of robust inorganic-rich electrode-electrolyte interphases. In addition, the introduction of HFME reduces the desolvation energy of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, improves ionic conductivity, strengthens the antioxidant, and enhances the safety of the electrolyte. As a result, the assembled Na||Na symmetric cell achieves a stable cycle of over 1800&#8197;h. The cell of Na||P&#8217;2-Na&lt;sub&gt;0.67&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; delivers a high capacity retention of 87.3&#8201;% with a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.7&#8201;% after 350&#8197;cycles. This work provides valuable insights into solvation chemistry for advanced electrolyte engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrogels with Differentiated Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Networks for Bioinspired Stress Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the deformation of Mimosa, a hydrogel designed by differentiated hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks exhibits stress response behavior. In contrast to current artificial materials, it autonomously undergoes reversible, multi&#8208;path, and multi&#8208;state deformation/locomotion responses based on a cooperative regulation mechanism. Furthermore, the hydrogel shows significant potential for time&#8208;dependent &#8220;double&#8208;lock&#8221; information encoding system.







Abstract
Stress response, an intricate and autonomously coordinated reaction in living organisms, holds a reversible, multi&#8208;path, and multi&#8208;state nature. However, existing stimuli&#8208;responsive materials often exhibit single&#8208;step and monotonous reactions due to the limited integration of structural components. Inspired by the cooperative interplay of extensor and flexor cells within Mimosa's pulvini, we present a hydrogel with differentiated hydrogen&#8208;bonding (H&#8208;bonding) networks designed to enable the biological stress response. Weak H&#8208;bonding domains resemble flexor cells, confined within a hydrophobic network stabilized by strong H&#8208;bonding clusters (acting like extensor cells). Under external force, strong H&#8208;bonding clusters are disrupted, facilitating water diffusion from the bottom layer and enabling transient expansion pressure gradient along the thickness direction. Subsequently, water diffuses upward, gradually equalizing the pressure, while weak H&#8208;bonding domains undergo cooperative elastic deformation. Consequently, the hydrogel autonomously undergoes a sequence of reversible and pluralistic motion responses, similar to Mimosa's touch&#8208;triggered stress response. Intriguingly, it exhibits stress&#8208;dependent color shifts under polarized light, highlighting its potential for applications in time&#8208;sensitive &#8220;double&#8208;lock&#8221; information encryption systems. This work achieves the coordinated stress response inspired by natural tissues using a simple hydrogel, paving the way for substantial advancements in the development of intelligent soft robots.

         <title>Differential Substrate Sensing in Terpene Synthases from Plants and Microorganisms: Insight from Structural, Bioinformatic, and EnzyDock Analyses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>

Terpene synthases sense their substrates in a binary manner via one of two reactive oxygen atoms. We hypothesize that this alteration in binding, and subsequent chemistry, is due to these enzymes originating from plants or microorganisms.







Abstract
Terpene synthases (TPSs) catalyze the first step in the formation of terpenoids, which comprise the largest class of natural products in nature. TPSs employ a family of universal natural substrates, composed of isoprenoid units bound to a diphosphate moiety. The intricate structures generated by TPSs are the result of substrate binding and folding in the active site, enzyme&#8208;controlled carbocation reaction cascades, and final reaction quenching. A key unaddressed question in class I TPSs is the asymmetric nature of the diphosphate&#8208;(Mg2+)3 cluster, which forms a critical part of the active site. In this asymmetric ion cluster, two diphosphate oxygen atoms protrude into the active site pocket. The substrate hydrocarbon tail, which is eventually molded into terpenes, can bind to either of these oxygen atoms, yet to which is unknown. Herein, we employ structural, bioinformatics, and EnzyDock docking tools to address this enigma. We bring initial data suggesting that this difference is rooted in evolutionary differences between TPSs. We hypothesize that this alteration in binding, and subsequent chemistry, is due to TPSs originating from plants or microorganisms. We further suggest that this difference can cast light on the frequent observation that the chiral products or intermediates of plant and bacterial terpene synthases represent opposite enantiomers.

         <title>Achieving Strong Circularly Polarized Luminescence through Cascade Cationic Insertion in Lead&#8208;free Hybrid Metal Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Playing a &#8220;cascade cationic insertion&#8221; trick to achieve strong CPL (with PLQY of ~100&#8201;%) in lead&#8208;free metal halides with simultaneous high glum values reaching &#8722;2.3&#215;10&#8722;2 from only achiral building blocks.







Abstract
Generating circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with simultaneous high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and dissymmetry factor (glum) is difficult due to usually unmatched electric transition dipole moment (&#956;) and magnetic transition dipole moment (m) of materials. Herein we tackle this issue by playing a &#8220;cascade cationic insertion&#8221; trick to achieve strong CPL (with PLQY of ~100&#8201;%) in lead&#8208;free metal halides with high glum values reaching &#8722;2.3&#215;10&#8722;2 without using any chiral inducers. Achiral solvents of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) infiltrate the crystal lattice via asymmetric hydrogen bonding, distorting the perovskite structure to induce the &#8220;intrinsic&#8221; chirality. Surprisingly, additional insertion of Cs+ cation to substitute partial (CH3)2NH2+ transforms the chiral space group to achiral but the crystal maintains chiroptical activity. Further doping of Sb3+ stimulates strong photoluminescence as a result of self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) formation without disturbing the crystal framework. The chiral perovskites of indium&#8208;antimony chlorides embedded on LEDs chips demonstrate promising potential as CPL emitters. Our work presents rare cases of chiroptical activity of highly luminescent perovskites from only achiral building blocks via spontaneous resolution as a result of symmetry breaking.

         <title>Postsynthetically Modified Alkoxide&#8208;Exchanged Ni2(OR)2BTDD: Synergistic Interactions of CO2 with Open Metal Sites and Functional Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through fine&#8208;tuned post&#8208;synthetic modifications, the bridging ligands of Ni2Cl2BTDD were selectively replaced by various alkoxide groups while retaining open metal sites. Alkoxide&#8208;exchanged MOFs showed synergistic CO2 uptake aided by multiple interactions with open metal sites and ligands.







Abstract
Postsynthetic modifications (PSMs) of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) play a crucial role in enhancing material performance through open metal site (OMS) functionalization or ligand exchange. However, a significant challenge persists in preserving open metal sites during ligand exchange, as these sites are inherently bound by incoming ligands. In this study, for the first time, we introduced alkoxides by exchanging bridging chloride in Ni2Cl2BTDD (BTDD=bis (1H&#8208;1,2,3,&#8211;triazolo [4,5&#8208;b],&#8211;[4&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;i]) dibenzo[1,4]dioxin) through PSM. Rietveld refinement of synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction data indicated that the alkoxide oxygen atom bridges Ni(II) centers while the OMSs of the MOF are preserved. Due to the synergy of the existing OMS and introduced functional group, the alkoxide&#8208;exchanged MOFs showed CO2 uptakes superior to the pristine MOF. Remarkably, the tert&#8208;butoxide&#8208;substituted Ni_T exhibited a nearly threefold and twofold increase in CO2 uptake compared to Ni2Cl2BTDD at 0.15 and 1&#8197;bar, respectively, as well as high water stability relative to the other exchanged frameworks. Furthermore, the Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations for Ni_T suggested that CO2 interacts with the OMS and the surrounding methyl groups of tert&#8208;butoxide groups, which is responsible for the enhanced CO2 capacity. This work provides a facile and unique synthetic strategy for realizing a desirable OMS&#8208;incorporating MOF platform through bridging ligand exchange.

In this study, for the first time, we introduced alkoxides by exchanging bridging chloride in Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BTDD (BTDD=bis (1H-1,2,3,&#8211;triazolo [4,5-b],&#8211;[4&#8242;,5&#8242;-i]) dibenzo[1,4]dioxin) through PSM. Rietveld refinement of synchrotron X-ray diffraction data indicated that the alkoxide oxygen atom bridges Ni(II) centers while the OMSs of the MOF are preserved. Due to the synergy of the existing OMS and introduced functional group, the alkoxide-exchanged MOFs showed CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptakes superior to the pristine MOF. Remarkably, the tert-butoxide-substituted &lt;b&gt;Ni_T&lt;/b&gt; exhibited a nearly threefold and twofold increase in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake compared to Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BTDD at 0.15 and 1&#8197;bar, respectively, as well as high water stability relative to the other exchanged frameworks. Furthermore, the Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations for &lt;b&gt;Ni_T&lt;/b&gt; suggested that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; interacts with the OMS and the surrounding methyl groups of tert-butoxide groups, which is responsible for the enhanced CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capacity. This work provides a facile and unique synthetic strategy for realizing a desirable OMS-incorporating MOF platform through bridging ligand exchange.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Pd/Organoboron&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective Carbohydrate Functionalization with Alkoxyallenes Involving Noncovalent Stereocontrol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing synergistic asymmetric palladium and organoboron catalysis, a host of formidable site&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and chemoselectivity challenges can be concomitantly addressed to precisely functionalize one out of multiple hydroxyl groups on a remarkable range of carbohydrate polyols. Mechanistic investigations unexpectedly revealed the pivotal stereocontrolling role of noncovalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding and CH&#8208;&#960; interactions.







Abstract
Herein, we demonstrate the robustness of a synergistic chiral Pd/organoboron system in tackling a challenging suite of site&#8208;, regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity issues across a considerable palette of biologically relevant carbohydrate polyols, when prochiral alkoxyallenes were employed as electrophiles. In view of the burgeoning role of noncovalent interactions (NCIs) in stereoselective carbohydrate synthesis, our mechanistic experiments and DFT modeling of the reaction path unexpectedly revealed that NCIs such as hydrogen bonding and CH&#8208;&#960; interactions between the resting states of the Pd&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl complex and the borinate saccharide are critically involved in the stereoselectivity control. Our strategy thus illuminates the untapped potential of harnessing NCIs in the context of transition metal catalysis to tackle stereoselectivity challenges in carbohydrate functionalization.

Ethyl propionate solvent with low&#8208;polarity and low&#8208;freezing&#8208;point enhances ion diffusion and Na+&#8208;desolvation kinetics at sub&#8208;zero temperatures. In addition, the combinatorial borate&#8208; and nitrile&#8208;based additive strategy facilitate uniform and inorganic&#8208;rich electrode interphases, ensuring excellent rate performance and cycle stability over a wide temperature range from &#8722;45&#8201;&#176;C to 60&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) present a promising avenue for next&#8208;generation grid&#8208;scale energy storage. However, realizing all&#8208;climate SIBs operating across a wide temperature range remains a challenge due to the poor electrolyte conductivity and instable electrode interphases at extreme temperatures. Here, we propose a comprehensively balanced electrolyte by pairing carbonates with a low&#8208;freezing&#8208;point and low&#8208;polarity ethyl propionate solvent which enhances ion diffusion and Na+&#8208;desolvation kinetics at sub&#8208;zero temperatures. Furthermore, the electrolyte leverages a combinatorial borate&#8208; and nitrile&#8208;based additive strategy to facilitate uniform and inorganic&#8208;rich electrode interphases, ensuring excellent rate performance and cycle stability over a wide temperature range from &#8722;45&#8201;&#176;C to 60&#8201;&#176;C. Notably, the Na||sodium vanadyl phosphate cell delivers a remarkable capacity of 105&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a high rate of 2&#8197;C at &#8722;25&#8201;&#176;C. In addition, the cells exhibit excellent cycling stability over a wide temperature range, maintaining a high capacity retention of 84.7&#8201;% over 3,000 cycles at 60&#8201;&#176;C and of 95.1&#8201;% at &#8722;25&#8201;&#176;C over 500 cycles. The full cell also exhibits impressive cycling performance over a wide temperature range. This study highlights the critical role of electrolyte and interphase engineering for enabling SIBs that function optimally under diverse and extreme climatic environments.

         <title>Boosting Cathode Activity and Anode Stability of Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries with Vigorous Iodic Species Triggered by Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iodine&#8208;nitrate (I2&#8722;LiNO3)&#8208;containing ether&#8208;based electrolyte has been applied to Li&#8722;S battery with a sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathode. The I&#8722;/HI&#8208;induced polymerization of 1,3&#8208;dioxolane is inhibited in the presence of nitrate. The nitrate can chemically oxidize I&#8722;/HI to I3&#8722;/IO3&#8722;, which play a crucial role to accelerate cathode conversion reaction and rejuvenate anode dead Li simultaneously. With the modified electrolyte, Li&#8722;S battery demonstrates long calendar life, high energy density and power efficiency.







Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) battery with a sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathode is a promising alternative to Li&#8208;ion systems. However, the sluggish charge transfer of cathode and accumulation of inactive Li on anode remain persistent challenges. An advanced electrolyte additive with function towards both cathode and anode holds great promise to address these issues. Herein, we present a new strategy to boost sulfur activity and rejuvenate dead Li simultaneously. In the polar electrolyte containing I2&#8722;LiNO3 additives, I3&#8722;/IO3&#8722; are triggered significantly by the reaction between NO3&#8722; and I&#8722; ions. The I3&#8722;/IO3&#8722; are reactive to insulated Li2S product of cathode and inactive Li on anode, thus accelerating the conversion reaction of sulfur and recovering Li sources back to battery cycling. The in situ/ex situ spectroscopic and morphologic monitoring reveal the crucial role of iodine in promoting Li2S dissociation and inhibiting dendritic Li growth. With the modified electrolyte, the symmetric Li||Li cells deliver a lifespan of 4000&#8197;h with an overpotential less than 12&#8197;mV at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. For Li&#8722;S cells, 100&#8201;% capacity retention up to thousands of cycles and enhanced rate capability are available. This work demonstrates a feasible strategy on electrolyte engineering for practical applications of Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Effective C4 Separation by Zeolite Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Composite Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;supported zeolite CGC membranes were fabricated by incorporating zeolites as fillers within the agZIF&#8208;62 matrix. There was excellent compatibility between two microporous phases through the formation of interfacial bonds, ensuring efficient separation of C4H6/C4 hydrocarbon gases. The strategy of combining zeolite with agZIF&#8208;62 reduces the catalysis of olefin gas and facilitates the stable separation process.







Abstract
Inorganic zeolites have excellent molecular sieving properties, but they are difficult to process into macroscopic structures. In this work, we use metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) glass as substrates to engineer the interface with inorganic zeolites, and then assemble the discrete crystalline zeolite powders into monolithic structures. The zeolites are well dispersed and stabilized within the MOF glass matrix, and the monolith has satisfactory mechanical stabilities for membrane applications. We demonstrate the effective separation performance of the membrane for 1,3&#8208;butadiene (C4H6) from other C4 hydrocarbons, which is a crucial and challenging separation in the chemical industry. The membrane achieves a high permeance of C4H6 (693.00&#177;21.83&#8197;GPU) and a high selectivity over n&#8208;butene, n&#8208;butane, isobutene, and isobutane (9.72, 9.94, 10.31, and 11.94, respectively). This strategy opens up new possibilities for developing advanced membrane materials for difficult hydrocarbon separations.

There was excellent compatibility between two microporous phases through the formation of interfacial bonds, ensuring efficient separation of C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; hydrocarbon gases. The strategy of combining zeolite with &lt;i&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;ZIF-62 reduces the catalysis of olefin gas and facilitates the stable separation process.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inorganic zeolites have excellent molecular sieving properties, but they are difficult to process into macroscopic structures. In this work, we use metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) glass as substrates to engineer the interface with inorganic zeolites, and then assemble the discrete crystalline zeolite powders into monolithic structures. The zeolites are well dispersed and stabilized within the MOF glass matrix, and the monolith has satisfactory mechanical stabilities for membrane applications. We demonstrate the effective separation performance of the membrane for 1,3-butadiene (C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) from other C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; hydrocarbons, which is a crucial and challenging separation in the chemical industry. The membrane achieves a high permeance of C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (693.00&#177;21.83&#8197;GPU) and a high selectivity over n-butene, n-butane, isobutene, and isobutane (9.72, 9.94, 10.31, and 11.94, respectively). This strategy opens up new possibilities for developing advanced membrane materials for difficult hydrocarbon separations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Search drugs for pain from freshly&#8208;made polychiral heterocycles: Asymmetric Cascade to a C5aR1 inhibitor as a Novel Pain Blocker.







Abstract
This study introduces a novel approach for synthesizing Benzoxazine&#8208;centered Polychiral Polyheterocycles (BPCPHCs) via an innovative asymmetric carbene&#8208;alkyne metathesis&#8208;triggered cascade. Overcoming challenges associated with intricate stereochemistry and multiple chiral centers, the catalytic asymmetric Carbene Alkyne Metathesis&#8208;mediated Cascade (CAMC) is employed using dirhodium catalyst/Br&#248;nsted acid co&#8208;catalysis, ensuring precise stereo control as validated by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Systematic substrate scope evaluation establishes exceptional diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities, creating a unique library of BPCPHCs. Pharmacological exploration identifies twelve BPCPHCs as potent Nav ion channel blockers, notably compound 8&#8201;g. In vivo studies demonstrate that intrathecal injection of 8&#8201;g effectively reverses mechanical hyperalgesia associated with chemotherapy&#8208;induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), suggesting a promising therapeutic avenue. Electrophysiological investigations unveil the inhibitory effects of 8&#8201;g on Nav1.7 currents. Molecular docking, dynamics simulations and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay provide insights into the stable complex formation and favorable binding free energy of 8&#8201;g with C5aR1. This research represents a significant advancement in asymmetric CAMC for BPCPHCs and unveils BPCPHC 8&#8201;g as a promising, uniquely acting pain blocker, establishing a C5aR1&#8208;Nav1.7 connection in the context of CIPN.

         <title>Spontaneous Molecule Aggregation for Nearly Single&#8208;Ion Conducting Sol Electrolyte to Advance Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries: The Case of Tetraphenylporphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetraphenylporphyrin tetrasulfonic acid (TPPS) is explored as an electrolyte additive for aqueous zinc metal batteries. It spontaneously assembles into unique aggregates, inhibiting electrolyte percolation and dendrite growth. It also facilitates anion association in the solvation sheath of Zn2+ and boosts the Zn&#8208;ion transfer. Therefore, the electrolyte containing TPPS greatly improves electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Zn metal as a promising anode of aqueous batteries faces severe challenges from dendrite growth and side reactions. Here, tetraphenylporphyrin tetrasulfonic acid (TPPS) is explored as an electrolyte additive for advanced Zn anodes. It is interesting to note that TPPS spontaneously assembles into unique aggregates. As they adsorb on the Zn anode, the aggregates enhance the resistance to electrolyte percolation and dendrite growth compared to single molecules. Meanwhile, TPPS facilitates anion association in the solvation sheath of Zn2+, and boosts the transference number of Zn2+ up to 0.95. Therefore, anion&#8208;related side reactions and anion&#8208;induced electrode overpotentials are reduced accordingly. In this context, the electrolyte containing TPPS exhibits excellent electrochemical performance. Even under a high loading of MnO2 (25&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2), a limited Zn supply (N/P ratio=1.7), and a lean electrolyte (15&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mAh&#8722;1), the full cells still represent a higher cumulative capacity compared to the reported data. The advantages of this electrolyte are also adapted to other cathode materials. The pouch cells of Zn||NaV3O8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1.5H2O realize a capacity of ~0.35&#8197;Ah at 0.4&#8197;C under harsh conditions.

Abstract
The generation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) largely determines the comprehensive performance of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. Herein, a novel &#8220;carrier&#8208;catalytic&#8221; integrated design is strategically exploited to in situ construct a stable LiF&#8208;LiBr rich SEI by improving the electron transfer kinetics to accelerate the bond&#8208;breaking dynamics. Specifically, the high electron transport capacity of Br&#8208;TPOM skeleton increases the polarity of C&#8722;Br, thus promoting the generation of LiBr. Then, the enhancement of electron transfer kinetics further promotes the fracture of C&#8722;F from TFSI&#8722; to form LiF. Finally, the stable and homogeneous artificial&#8208;SEI with enriched lithium dihalide is constructed through the in situ co&#8208;growth mechanism of LiF and LiBr, which facilitatse the Li&#8208;ion transport kinetics and regulates the lithium deposition behavior. Impressively, the PEO&#8208;Br&#8208;TPOM paired with LiFePO4 delivers ultra&#8208;long cycling stability over 1000&#8197;cycles with 81&#8201;% capacity retention at 1&#8197;C while the pouch cells possess 88&#8201;% superior capacity retention after 550&#8197;cycles with initial discharge capacity of 145&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1at 0.2&#8197;C in the absence of external pressure. Even under stringent conditions, the practical pouch cells possess the practical capacity with stable electric quantities plateau in 30&#8197;cycles demonstrates its application potential in energy storage field.

         <title>Proximity Effects on the Reactivity of a Nonheme Iron (IV) Oxo Complex in C&#8722;H Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report evidence that supramolecular substrate binding increases several aspects of iron (IV) oxo (Fe(IV)=O) reactivity not only in nonheme oxygenases but also in synthetic models. Recognition&#8208;induced proximity of certain substrate C&#8722;H bonds increases both rate and selectivity for their C&#8722;H abstraction, analyzed by Effective Molarity, and increases the efficiency of subsequent Oxygen Rebound, as exclusively observed in enzymes.







Abstract
Precise control of substrate positioning and orientation (its proximity to the reactive unit) is often invoked to rationalize the superior enzymatic reaction rates and selectivities when compared to synthetic models. Artificial nonheme iron (IV) oxo (Fe(IV)=O) complexes react with C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds via a biomimetic Hydrogen Atom Transfer/Hydroxyl Rebound mechanism, but rates, site&#8208;selectivity and even hydroxyl rebound efficiency (ligand rebound versus substrate radical diffusion) are smaller than in oxygenases. Herein, we quantitatively analyze how substrate binding modulates nonheme Fe(IV)=O reactivity by comparing rates and outcomes of C&#8722;H oxidation by a pair of Fe(IV)=O complexes that share the same first coordination sphere but only one contains a crown ether receptor that recognizes the substrate. Substrate binding makes the reaction intramolecular, exhibiting Michaelis&#8211;Menten kinetics and increased reaction rates.

     alt="Proximity Effects on the Reactivity of a Nonheme Iron (IV) Oxo Complex in C&#8722;H Oxidation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report evidence that supramolecular substrate binding increases several aspects of iron (IV) oxo (Fe(IV)=O) reactivity not only in nonheme oxygenases but also in synthetic models. Recognition-induced proximity of certain substrate C&#8722;H bonds increases both rate and selectivity for their C&#8722;H abstraction, analyzed by Effective Molarity, and increases the efficiency of subsequent Oxygen Rebound, as exclusively observed in enzymes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precise control of substrate positioning and orientation (its proximity to the reactive unit) is often invoked to rationalize the superior enzymatic reaction rates and selectivities when compared to synthetic models. Artificial nonheme iron (IV) oxo (Fe(IV)=O) complexes react with C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bonds via a biomimetic Hydrogen Atom Transfer/Hydroxyl Rebound mechanism, but rates, site-selectivity and even hydroxyl rebound efficiency (ligand rebound versus substrate radical diffusion) are smaller than in oxygenases. Herein, we quantitatively analyze how substrate binding modulates nonheme Fe(IV)=O reactivity by comparing rates and outcomes of C&#8722;H oxidation by a pair of Fe(IV)=O complexes that share the same first coordination sphere but only one contains a crown ether receptor that recognizes the substrate. Substrate binding makes the reaction intramolecular, exhibiting Michaelis&#8211;Menten kinetics and increased reaction rates. In addition, C&#8722;H oxidation occurs with high site selectivity for remote sites. Analysis of Effective Molarity reveals that the system operates at its maximal theoretical capability for the oxidation of these remote sites. Remarkably, substrate positioning also affects Hydroxyl Rebound, whose efficiency only increases on the sites placed in proximity by recognition. Overall, these observations provide evidence that supramolecular control of substrate positioning can effectively modulate the reactivity of oxygenases and its models.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Calcium&#8208;Ligand Cooperation Promoted Activation of N2O, Amine, and H2 as well as Catalytic Hydrogenation of Imines, Quinoline, and Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report here a series of dearomatized calcium pincer complexes. They exhibit high activity toward N2O, secondary amines, and D2(H2), leading to the facile synthesis of calcium diazotate complexes and heterolytic cleavage of N&#8722;H and D&#8722;D(H&#8722;H) bonds by a metal&#8208;ligand cooperation (MLC) manner. In addition, hydrogenation of various unsaturated molecules was realized, catalyzed by dearomatized calcium pincer complexes.







Abstract
Bond activation and catalysis using s&#8208;block metals are of great significance. Herein, a series of calcium pincer complexes with deprotonated side arms have been prepared using pyridine&#8208;based PNP and PNN ligands. The complexes were characterized by NMR and X&#8208;ray crystal diffraction. Utilizing the obtained calcium complexes, unprecedented N2O activation by metal&#8208;ligand cooperation (MLC) involving dearomatization&#8208;aromatization of the pyridine ligand was achieved, generating aromatized calcium diazotate complexes as products. Additionally, the dearomatized calcium complexes were able to activate the N&#8722;H bond as well as reversibly activate H2, offering an opportunity for the catalytic hydrogenation of various unsaturated molecules. DFT calculations were applied to analyze the electronic structures of the synthesized complexes and explore possible reaction mechanisms. This study is an important complement to the area of MLC and main&#8208;group metal chemistry.

         <title>Engineering a Dual&#8208;Functionalized PolyHIPE Resin for Photobiocatalytic Flow Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new polyHIPE (high internal phase emulsion) resin served as a solid support system for both a halogenase enzyme and a benzothiadiazole (BTZ) photosensitizer. It was then used in a continuous flow system for the electrophilic bromination of aromatic substrates. This support offers excellent single pass and recirculation yields. It is stable and reusable and allows for straightforward product separation owing to its heterogeneous nature.







Abstract
The use of a dual resin for photobiocatalysis, encompassing both a photocatalyst and an immobilized enzyme, brings several challenges, including effective immobilization, maintaining photocatalyst and enzyme activity and ensuring sufficient light penetration. However, the benefits, such as integrated processes, reusability, easier product separation, and potential for scalability, can outweigh these challenges, making dual resin systems promising for efficient and sustainable photobiocatalytic applications. In this study, we employed a photosensitizer&#8208;containing porous emulsion&#8208;templated polymer as a functional support that is used to covalently anchor a chloroperoxidase from Curvularia inaequalis (CiVCPO). We demonstrate the versatility of this heterogeneous photobiocatalytic material, which enables the bromination of four aromatic substrates, including rutin&#8212;a natural occurring flavonol&#8212;under blue light (456&#8197;nm) irradiation and continuous flow conditions.

         <title>Reduced Volume Expansion of Micron&#8208;Sized SiOx via Closed&#8208;Nanopore Structure Constructed by Mg&#8208;Induced Elemental Segregation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The segregation of O was adjusted by in situ Mg doping during the vacuum deposition process to construct closed&#8208;nanopore structure in micron&#8208;sized SiOx. The obtained SiOxMgy@C realized a porosity of 14.4&#8201;% with closed&#8208;nanopores, leading to a reduced volume expansion of the electrode from 77.8&#8201;% to 29.8&#8201;% and thus improved cycling stability.







Abstract
The inherently huge volume expansion during Li uptake has hindered the use of Si&#8208;based anodes in high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries. While some pore&#8208;forming and nano&#8208;architecting strategies show promises to effectively buffer the volume change, other parameters essential for practical electrode fabrication, such as compaction density, are often compromised. Here we propose a new in situ Mg doping strategy to form closed&#8208;nanopore structure into a micron&#8208;sized SiOx particle at a high bulk density. The doped Mg atoms promote the segregation of O, so that high&#8208;density magnesium silicates form to generate closed nanopores. By altering the mass content of Mg dopant, the average radii (ranged from 5.4 to 9.7&#8197;nm) and porosities (ranged from 1.4&#8201;% to 15.9&#8201;%) of the closed pores are precisely adjustable, which accounts for volume expansion of SiOx from 77.8&#8201;% to 22.2&#8201;% at the minimum. Benefited from the small volume variation, the Mg&#8208;doped micron&#8208;SiOx anode demonstrates improved Li storage performance towards realization of a 700&#8208;(dis)charge&#8208;cycle, 11&#8208;Ah&#8208;pouch&#8208;type cell at a capacity retention of &gt;80&#8201;%. This work offers insights into reasonable design of the internal structure of micron&#8208;sized SiOx and other materials that undergo conversion or alloying reactions with drastic volume change, to enable high&#8208;energy batteries with stable electrochemistry.

         <title>Steric&#8208;hindrance Effect Tuned Ion Solvation Enabling High Performance Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of versatile low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;safety steric&#8208;hindrance electrolytes are fabricated by dissolving large&#8208;sized sucrose biomolecule in aqueous electrolyte for aqueous zinc ion batteries, which possess the uniformly&#8208;distributed and enlarged Zn2+ solvation structure due to the steric&#8208;hindrance effect of sucrose and effectively induce in situ formation of organic and inorganic hybrid SEI, thus affording high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc ion batteries working at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C~+40&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Despite many additives have been reported for aqueous zinc ion batteries, steric&#8208;hindrance effect of additives and its correlation with Zn2+ solvation structure have been rarely reported. Herein, large&#8208;sized sucrose biomolecule is selected as a paradigm additive, and steric&#8208;hindrance electrolytes (STEs) are developed to investigate the steric&#8208;hindrance effect for solvation structure regulation. Sucrose molecules do not participate in Zn2+ solvation shell, but significantly homogenize the distribution of solvated Zn2+ and enlarge Zn2+ solvation shell with weakened Zn2+&#8722;H2O interaction due to the steric&#8208;hindrance effect. More importantly, STEs afford the water&#8208;shielding electric double layer and in situ construct the organic and inorganic hybrid solid electrolyte interface, which effectively boost Zn anode reversibility. Remarkably, Zn//NVO battery presents high capacity of 3.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with long cycling stability for over 650&#8197;cycles at lean electrolyte of 4.5&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mg&#8722;1 and low N/P ratio of 1.5, and the stable operation at wide temperature (&#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C~+40&#8201;&#176;C).

Remarkably, Zn//NVO battery presents high capacity of 3.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with long cycling stability for over 650&#8197;cycles at lean electrolyte of 4.5&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and low N/P ratio of 1.5, and the stable operation at wide temperature (&#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C~+40&#8201;&#176;C).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Design of an In&#8208;Situ Polymer&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Realising Stable Zn Metal Anode under Harsh Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust polymer&#8208;inorganic SEI is in situ constructed on Zn anode through controllable polymerization and coprecipitation mechanism. Compared with bare Zn and recent in situ SEIs, polymer&#8208;inorganic SEI combines both superiorities of polymer phases for high toughness and inorganic phases for high modulus, enabling stable electrode/electrolyte interface even under harsh conditions.







Abstract
The in&#8208;depth understanding of the composition&#8208;property&#8208;performance relationship of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is the basis of developing a reliable SEI to stablize the Zn anode&#8208;electrolyte interface, but it remains unclear in rechargeable aqueous zinc ion batteries. Herein, a well&#8208;designed electrolyte based on 2&#8197;M Zn(CF3SO3)2&#8208;0.2&#8197;M acrylamide&#8208;0.2&#8197;M ZnSO4 is proposed. A robust polymer (polyacrylamide)&#8208;inorganic (Zn4SO4(OH)6.xH2O) hybrid SEI is in situ constructed on Zn anodes through controllable polymerization of acrylamide and coprecipitation of SO42&#8722; with Zn2+ and OH&#8722;. For the first time, the underlying SEI composition&#8208;property&#8208;performance relationship is systematically investigated and correlated. The results showed that the polymer&#8208;inorganic hybrid SEI, which integrates the high modulus of the inorganic component with the high toughness of the polymer ingredient, can realize high reversibility and long&#8208;term interfacial stability, even under ultrahigh areal current density and capacity (30&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2~30&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The resultant Zn||NH4V4O10 cell also exhibits excellent cycling stability. This work will provide a guidance for the rational design of SEI layers in rechargeable aqueous zinc ion batteries.

         <title>Unveiling the Role of Water in Heterogeneous Photocatalysis of Methanol Conversion for Efficient Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water shows adverse effects on the adsorption of methanol and the desorption of liquid products from photocatalytic methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion, which leads to a nearly linear increase of the H2 production with the reduction of water content in methanol aqueous solution.







Abstract
Water molecules, which act as both solvent and reactant, play critical roles in photocatalytic reactions for methanol conversion. However, the influence of water on the adsorption of methanol and desorption of liquid products, which are two essential steps that control the performance in photocatalysis, has been well under&#8208;explored. Herein, we reveal the role of water in heterogeneous photocatalytic processes of methanol conversion on the platinized carbon nitride (Pt/C3N4) model photocatalyst. In situ spectroscopy techniques, isotope effects, and computational calculations demonstrate that water shows adverse effects on the adsorption of methanol molecules and desorption processes of methanol oxidation products on the surface of Pt/C3N4, significantly altering the reaction pathways in photocatalytic methanol conversion process. Guided by these discoveries, a photothermal&#8208;assisted photocatalytic system is designed to achieve a high solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of 2.3&#8201;%, which is among the highest values reported. This work highlights the important roles of solvents in controlling the adsorption/desorption behaviours of liquid&#8208;phase heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Silylation: Spin&#8208;Crossover&#8208;Efficiency&#8208;Determined Chemoselectivity</title>

         <dc:description>
An iron&#8208;catalyzed allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H silylation/alkyne hydrosilylation reaction was developed in which the spin state of the open&#8208;shell iron catalyst dictates the reaction kinetics and pathway. This chemoselectivity, governed by the spin&#8208;crossover efficiency, indicates an unexpected dimension in spin effects.







Abstract
The nuanced role of spin effects remains a critical gap in designing proficient open&#8208;shell catalysts. This study elucidates an iron&#8208;catalyzed allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H silylation/alkyne hydrosilylation reaction, in which the spin state of the open&#8208;shell iron catalyst dictates the reaction kinetics and pathway. Specifically, spin crossover led to alkyne hydrosilylation, whereas spin conservation resulted in a novel allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H silylation reaction. This chemoselectivity, governed by the spin&#8208;crossover efficiency, reveals an unexpected dimension in spin effects and a first in the realm of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed in situ silylation of allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, which had been previously inhibited by the heightened reactivity of alkenes in hydrosilylation reactions. Furthermore, this spin crossover can either accelerate or hinder the reaction at different stages within a single catalytic reaction, a phenomenon scarcely documented. Moreover, we identify a substrate&#8208;assisted C&#8722;H activation mechanism, a departure from known ligand&#8208;assisted processes, offering a fresh perspective on C&#8722;H activation strategies.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;chiral Nonlinear Optical Effect with Large Anisotropic Response in Two&#8208;Dimensional Halide Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient discrimination and generation of circularly polarized light through nonlinear optical responses are achieved by dominant contribution of magnetic dipole (MD) transitions in two&#8208;dimensional perovskite. This study not only contributes to the advancement of our comprehension of chiral nonlinear optics in organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites but also showcases the advantageous potential in optical quantum information devices.







Abstract
The chiral organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskites (OIHPs) are vital candidates for superior nonlinear optical (NLO) effects associated with circularly polarized (CP) light. NLO in chiral materials often couples with magnetic dipole (MD) transition, as well as the conventional electric dipole (ED) transition. However, the importance of MD transition in NLO process of chiral OIHPs has not yet been well recognized. Here, the circular polarized probe analysis of second harmonic generation circular dichroism (SHG&#8208;CD) provides the direct evidence that the contribution of MD leads to a large anisotropic response to CP lights in chiral OIHPs, (R&#8208;/S&#8208;MBACl)2PbI4. The thin films exhibit great sensitivity to CP lights over a wide wavelength range, and the g&#8208;value reaches up to 1.57 at the wavelength where the contribution of MD is maximized. Furthermore, it is also effective as CP light generator, outputting CP&#8208;SHG with maximum g&#8208;factor of 1.76 upon the stimulation of linearly polarized light. This study deepens the understanding of relation between chirality and magneto&#8208;optical effect, and such an efficient discrimination and generation of CP light signal is highly applicable for chirality&#8208;based sensor and optical communication devices.

         <title>Accelerated Dynamic Reconstruction in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Ligand Defects for Selective Electrooxidation of Amines to Azos Coupling with Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand defects promote potential&#8208;dependent multistep dynamic reconstruction of Ni MOFs, enabling the overall reaction of selectively electrocatalytic amine to azo coupled with hydrogen production. Various in situ techniques were used to monitor the effect of Ni&#8722;O and Ni&#8722;Ni distance on the electrosynthesis process, guiding the design of efficient catalysts.







Abstract
Electrosynthesis coupled hydrogen production (ESHP) mostly involves catalyst reconstruction in aqueous phase, but accurately identifying and controlling the process is still a challenge. Herein, we modulated the electronic structure and exposed unsaturated sites of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) via ligand defect to promote the reconstruction of catalyst for azo electrosynthesis (ESA) coupled with hydrogen production overall reaction. The monolayer Ni&#8208;MOFs achieved 89.8&#8201;% Faraday efficiency and 90.8&#8201;% selectivity for the electrooxidation of 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;amine (Pyr&#8722;NH2) to azo, and an 18.5&#8208;fold increase in H2 production compared to overall water splitting. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption fine spectroscopy (XAFS) and various in situ spectroscopy confirm that the ligand defect promotes the potential dependent dynamic reconstruction of Ni(OH)2 and NiOOH, and the reabsorption of ligand significantly lowers the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step (*Pyr&#8722;NH to *Pyr&#8722;N). This work provides theoretical guidance for modulation of electrocatalyst reconstruction to achieve highly selective ESHP.

         <title>RNA Control via Redox&#8208;Responsive Acylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cloaking strategy that enables the redox&#8208;responsive control of RNA via 2&#8242;&#8208;OH acylation is described. The introduced disulfide&#8208;containing acyl groups can temporarily cloak structures and functions of RNA, and mediate the cellular uptake of RNA, while responding to reducing environments to trigger the restoration of cloaked RNA.







Abstract
Incorporating stimuli&#8208;responsive components into RNA constructs provides precise spatiotemporal control over RNA structures and functions. Despite considerable advancements, the utilization of redox&#8208;responsive stimuli for the activation of caged RNAs remains scarce. In this context, we present a novel strategy that leverages post&#8208;synthetic acylation coupled with redox&#8208;responsive chemistry to exert control over RNA. To achieve this, we design and synthesize a series of acylating reagents specifically tailored for introducing disulfide&#8208;containing acyl adducts into the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH groups of RNA (&#8220;cloaking&#8221;). Our data reveal that these acyl moieties can be readily appended, effectively blocking RNA catalytic activity and folding. We also demonstrate the traceless release and reactivation of caged RNAs (&#8220;uncloaking&#8221;) through reducing stimuli. By employing this strategy, RNA exhibits rapid cellular uptake, effective distribution and activation in the cytosol without lysosomal entrapment. We anticipate that our methodology will be accessible to laboratories engaged in RNA biology and holds promise as a versatile platform for RNA&#8208;based applications.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Trisubstituted Vicinal Diols through Copper(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Diastereoselective and Enantioselective Allylation of Ketones with Siloxypropadienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric synthesis of trisubstituted vicinal diols is accomplished by copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed diastereoselective and enantioselective reductive allylation of ketones with siloxypropadienes. The generation of both syn&#8208;diols and anti&#8208;diols is rationalized by DFT calculations, which show that cis&#8208;&#947;&#8208;siloxy&#8208;allyl copper species are generated favorably in the reduction of either 1&#8208;TBSO&#8208;propadiene or 1&#8208;TIPSO&#8208;propadiene by copper hydride species.







Abstract
Chiral trisubstituted vicinal diols are a type of important organic compounds, serving as both common structure units in bioactive natural products and chiral auxiliaries in asymmetric synthesis. Herein, by using siloxypropadienes as the precursors of allyl copper(I) species, a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed diastereoselective and enantioselective reductive allylation of ketones was achieved, providing both syn&#8208;diols and anti&#8208;diols in good to excellent enantioselectivity. DFT calculations show that cis&#8208;&#947;&#8208;siloxy&#8208;allyl copper species are generated favorably with either 1&#8208;TBSO&#8208;propadiene or 1&#8208;TIPSO&#8208;propadiene. Moreover, the steric difference of TBS group and TIPS group distinguishes the face selectivity of acetophenone, leading to syn&#8208;selectivity for 1&#8208;TBSO&#8208;propadiene and anti&#8208;selectivity for 1&#8208;TIPSO&#8208;propadiene. Easy transformations of the products were performed, demonstrating the synthetic utility of the present method. Moreover, one chiral diol prepared in the above transformations was used as a suitable organocatalyst for the catalytic asymmetric reductive self&#8208;coupling of aldimines generated in situ with B2(neo)2.

         <title>Vinyl&#8208;Group&#8208;Anchored Covalent Organic Framework for Promoting the Photocatalytic Generation of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vinyl&#8208;anchored covalent organic frameworks were designed to enhance interlayer forces, broaden the light&#8208;absorption range, and improve charge&#8208;separation and &#8208;transfer efficiency. This strategy promotes the photocatalytic two&#8208;electron oxygen&#8208;reduction reaction to produce hydrogen peroxide.







Abstract
The artificial photosynthesis of H2O2 from water and oxygen using semiconductor photocatalysts is attracting increasing levels of attention owing to its green, environmentally friendly, and energy&#8208;saving characteristics. Although covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising materials for promoting photocatalytic H2O2 production owing to their structural and functional diversity, they typically suffer from low charge&#8208;generation and &#8208;transfer efficiencies as well as rapid charge recombination, which restricts their use as catalysts for photocatalytic H2O2 production. Herein, we report a strategy for anchoring vinyl moieties to a COF skeleton to facilitate charge separation and migration, thereby promoting photocatalytic H2O2 generation. This vinyl&#8208;group&#8208;bearing COF photocatalyst exhibits a H2O2&#8208;production rate of 84.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 (per 10&#8197;mg), which is ten&#8208;times higher than that of the analog devoid of vinyl functionality and superior to most reported COF photocatalysts. Both experimental and theoretical studies provide deep insight into the origin of the improved photocatalytic performance. These findings are expected to facilitate the rational design and modification of organic semiconductors for use in photocatalytic applications.

         <title>Li3PO4&#8208;Enriched SEI on Graphite Anode Boosts Li+ De&#8208;Solvation Enabling Fast&#8208;Charging and Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

In this article, we embark on a systematic exploration of the influence exerted by various inorganic components (Li2CO3, LiF, Li3PO4) found in the SEI on their role in promoting the Li+ de&#8208;solvation. The findings highlight that an Li3PO4&#8208;enriched SEI effectively weakens the interaction between Li+ and solvent. Building on this, we engineer a Li3PO4 interphase on graphite (LPO&#8722;Gr) via a simple solid&#8208;phase coating, significantly facilitating the Li+ de&#8208;solvation and building an inorganic&#8208;rich SEI.







Abstract
Li+ de&#8208;solvation at solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI)&#8208;electrolyte interface stands as a pivotal step that imposes limitations on the fast&#8208;charging capability and low&#8208;temperature performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Unraveling the contributions of key constituents in the SEI that facilitate Li+ de&#8208;solvation and deciphering their mechanisms, as a design principle for the interfacial structure of anode materials, is still a challenge. Herein, we conducted a systematic exploration of the influence exerted by various inorganic components (Li2CO3, LiF, Li3PO4) found in the SEI on their role in promoting the Li+ de&#8208;solvation. The findings highlight that Li3PO4&#8208;enriched SEI effectively reduces the de&#8208;solvation energy due to its ability to attenuate the Li+&#8208;solvent interaction, thereby expediting the de&#8208;solvation process. Building on this, we engineer Li3PO4 interphase on graphite (LPO&#8722;Gr) anode via a simple solid&#8208;phase coating, facilitating the Li+ de&#8208;solvation and building an inorganic&#8208;rich SEI, resulting in accelerated Li+ transport crossing the electrode interfaces and interphases. Full cells using the LPO&#8722;Gr anode can replenish its 80&#8201;% capacity in 6.5&#8197;minutes, while still retaining 70&#8201;% of the room temperature capacity even at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. Our strategy establishes connection between the de&#8208;solvation characteristics of the SEI components and the interfacial structure design of anode materials for high performance LIBs.

         <title>Interfacial Engineering for Oriented Crystal Growth toward Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Anode for Aqueous Zinc Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Planar nucleation and oriented growth of (002) crystal plane is visualized by in situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy on an Ag&#8208;modified surface. The high solubility of Ag in Zn metal enables formation of solid solution buffer layer with greatly decreased nucleation barrier. The preferential orientation of deposition exhibits dendrite&#8208;free morphology with suppressed side reactions, meriting the high Zn utilization and improved electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Zn deposition with a surface&#8208;preferred (002) crystal plane has attracted extensive attention due to its inhibited dendrite growth and side reactions. However, the nucleation and growth of the Zn(002) crystal plane are closely related to the interfacial properties. Herein, oriented growth of Zn(002) crystal plane is realized on Ag&#8208;modified surface that is directly visualized by in situ atomic force microscopy. A solid solution HCP&#8208;Zn (~1.10&#8197;at.&#8201;% solubility of Ag, 30&#8201;&#176;C) is formed on the Ag coated Zn foil (Zn@Ag) and possesses the same crystal structure as Zn to reduce its nucleation barrier caused by their lattice mismatch. It merits oriented Zn deposition and corrosion&#8208;resistant surface, and presents long cycling stability in symmetric cells and full cells coupled with V2O5 cathode. This work provides insights into interfacial regulation of Zn anodes for high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc metal batteries.

         <title>Unusual Stabilisation of Remarkably Bent Tetra&#8208;Cationic Tetra&#8208;radical Intermolecular Fe(III) &#956;&#8208;Oxo Tetranuclear Complexes</title>

A hitherto unknown series of air stable, &#960;&#8208;conjugated, remarkably bent tetra&#8208;cation tetra&#8208;radical intermolecular &#956;&#8208;oxo tetranuclear complexes has been reported and structurally characterised. These species facilitate long&#8208;range charge/radical delocalisation through the bridge across the entire tetranuclear unit, manifesting unusually intense NIR bands. Assorted spin states of Fe(III) centres are stabilised: terminal six&#8208;coordinate iron centres stabilise the admixed&#8208;intermediate spin states, while the central five&#8208;coordinate iron centres stabilise the high&#8208;spin states. A strong exchange coupling among the centres, coupled with the bent nature of the Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Fe moiety, promotes intense NIR bands.







Abstract
A hitherto unknown series of air stable, &#960;&#8208;conjugated, remarkably bent tetra&#8208;cation tetra&#8208;radical intermolecular Fe(III) &#956;&#8208;oxo tetranuclear complex, isolated from the dication diradical diiron(III) porphyrin dimers, has been synthesised and spectroscopically characterised along with single crystal X&#8208;ray structure determination of two such molecules. These species facilitate long&#8208;range charge/radical delocalisation through the bridge across the entire tetranuclear unit manifesting an unusually intense NIR band. Assorted spin states of Fe(III) centres are stabilised within these unique tetranuclear frameworks: terminal six&#8208;coordinate iron centres stabilise the admixed intermediate spin states while the central five&#8208;coordinate iron centres stabilise the high&#8208;spin states. Variable temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements indicated strong antiferromagnetic coupling for the Fe(III)&#8722;O&#8722;Fe(III) unit while the exchange interactions between the Fe centres and the porphyrin &#960;&#8208;cation radicals are weaker as supported both by magnetic data and DFT calculations. The nature of orbital overlap between the SOMOs of Fe(III) and &#960;* orbital of the porphyrin was found to rationalise the observed exchange coupling, establishing such a complex magnetic exchange in this tetranuclear model with a significant bioinorganic relevance.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Migratory Hydrocyanation of Internal Alkenes: Expanding the Scope to &#945;,&#969;&#8208;Diaryl Internal Alkenes</title>

         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrocyanation of internal alkenes involving a chain&#8208;walking process is reported. The reaction exhibits excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity, proceeds under mild reaction conditions, and delivers benzylic nitriles in high yields. Even &#945;,&#969;&#8208;diaryl internal alkenes could be successfully converted to the desired products with good regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity by modifying the electronic and steric effects.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed migratory functionalization of alkenes witnessed extensive development in the past few years. However, the asymmetric version of this reaction has remained largely underdeveloped owing to the difficulty in simultaneous control of both regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. In addition, exploring the wider alkene substrate scope to enable more synthetically valuable applications represents another challenge in this field. In this context, a nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrocyanation of internal alkenes involving a chain&#8208;walking process is demonstrated. The reaction exhibits excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity, proceeds under mild reaction conditions, and delivers benzylic nitriles in high yields. Even &#945;,&#969;&#8208;diaryl internal alkenes, which are known to be one of the most challenging substrates of this type, could be successfully converted to the desired products with good regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity by modifying the electronic and steric effects. Theoretical calculations suggest that the &#951;3&#8208;benzyl coordination mode and the aryl substituent (3,5&#8208;(OMe)2C6H3) on the diphosphite ligand are both key factors in regulating regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity.

         <title>Discovery of Terminal Oxazole&#8208;Bearing Natural Products by a Targeted Metabologenomic Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metabologenomic discovery method for terminal oxazole&#8208;bearing natural products was devised by integrating genomic screening utilizing a PCR primer set for oxazole cyclase genes with spectroscopic detection of oxazole based on the unique 1JCH values and chemical shifts. This metabologenomic method enables the logical and efficient discovery of new microbial natural products with a target structural motif without isotopic labeling.







Abstract
A targeted metabologenomic method was developed to selectively discover terminal oxazole&#8208;bearing natural products from bacteria. For this, genes encoding oxazole cyclase, a key enzyme in terminal oxazole biosynthesis, were chosen as the genomic signature to screen bacterial strains that may produce oxazole&#8208;bearing compounds. Sixteen strains were identified from the screening of a bacterial DNA library (1,000&#8197;strains) using oxazole cyclase gene&#8208;targeting polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers. The PCR amplicon sequences were subjected to phylogenetic analysis and classified into nine clades. 1H&#8722;13C coupled&#8208;HSQC NMR spectra obtained from the culture extracts of the hit strains enabled the unequivocal detection of the target compounds, including five new oxazole compounds, based on the unique 1JCH values and chemical shifts of oxazole: lenzioxazole (1) possessing an unprecedented cyclopentane, permafroxazole (2) bearing a tetraene conjugated with carboxylic acid, tenebriazine (3) incorporating two modified amino acids, and methyl&#8208;oxazolomycins A and B (4 and 5). Tenebriazine displayed inhibitory activity against pathogenic fungi, whereas methyl&#8208;oxazolomycins A and B (4 and 5) selectively showed anti&#8208;proliferative activity against estrogen receptor&#8208;positive breast cancer cells. This metabologenomic method enables the logical and efficient discovery of new microbial natural products with a target structural motif without the need for isotopic labeling.

         <title>Investigating the Therapeutic Effects of Ferroptosis on Myocardial Ischemia&#8208;Reperfusion Injury Using a Dual&#8208;Locking Mitochondrial Targeting Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;lock mitochondrial targeting strategy for probe CBS, which incorporates electrostatic forces and probe&#8208;protein docking principles, was firstly proposed and demonstrated. Our work achieved stable and precise visualization of mitochondrial viscosity in triggered and medicated myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MIRI) and confirmed the therapeutic value of ferroptosis in MIRI







Abstract
Research on ferroptosis in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MIRI) using mitochondrial viscosity as a nexus holds great promise for MIRI therapy. However, high&#8208;precision visualisation of mitochondrial viscosity remains a formidable task owing to the debilitating electrostatic interactions caused by damaged mitochondrial membrane potential. Herein, we propose a dual&#8208;locking mitochondria&#8208;targeting strategy that incorporates electrostatic forces and probe&#8208;protein molecular docking. Even in damaged mitochondria, stable and precise visualisation of mitochondrial viscosity in triggered and medicated MIRI was achieved owing to the sustained driving forces (e.g., pi&#8208;cation, pi&#8208;alkyl interactions, etc.) between the developed probe, CBS, and the mitochondrial membrane protein. Moreover, complemented by a western blot, we confirmed that ferrostatin&#8208;1 exerts its therapeutic effect on MIRI by improving the system xc&#8722;/GSH/GPX4 antioxidant system, confirming the therapeutic value of ferroptosis in MIRI. This study presents a novel strategy for developing robust mitochondrial probes, thereby advancing MIRI treatment.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Photochemical Cascade Process Boosting Smart Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence in Bismuth Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach to leveraging photochemical cascade processes (PCCPs) involved photocycloaddition and photogenerated radicals in molecular crystals was proposed, which can be further used to design stepwise smart room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) switch. It provides a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for developing solid&#8208;state PCCPs integrating light&#8208;chemical&#8208;mechanical energy conversion, paving an effective way to design photo&#8208;controllable ultralong RTP.







Abstract
Molecular ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), exhibiting multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive characteristics, has garnered considerable attention due to its potential applications in light&#8208;emitting devices, sensors, and information safety. This work proposes the utilization of photochemical cascade processes (PCCPs) in molecular crystals to design a stepwise smart RTP switch. By harnessing the sequential dynamics of photo&#8208;burst movement (induced by [2+2] photocycloaddition) and photochromism (induced by photogenerated radicals) in a bismuth (Bi)&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic halide (MOH), a continuous and photo&#8208;responsive ultralong RTP can be achieved. Furthermore, utilizing the same Bi&#8208;based MOH, diverse application demonstrations, such as multi&#8208;mode anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption, can be easily implemented. This work thus not only serves as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for the development of solid&#8208;state PCCPs that integrate photosalient effect and photochromism with light&#8208;chemical&#8208;mechanical energy conversion, but also lays the groundwork for designing new Bi&#8208;based MOHs with dynamically responsive ultralong RTP.

         <title>Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Organic Solar Cells Enabled by 1,3,4&#8208;Selenadiazole&#8208;Containing Crystalline Small Molecule with Double&#8208;Fibril Network Morphology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fibrilization of the small molecule acceptor by adding a trace amount of small molecule donors and fibril network optimization of the donor layer by introducing another polymer donor resulted in an optimal double&#8208;fibril network of the photoactive layer and an impressive power conversion efficiency of 19.38&#8201;% for layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer organic solar cells.







Abstract
A double&#8208;fibril network of the photoactive layer morphology is recognized as an ideal structure facilitating exciton diffusion and charge carrier transport for high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs). However, in the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer processed OSCs (LbL&#8208;OSCs), polymer donors and small molecule acceptors (SMAs) are separately deposited, and it is challenging to realize a fibril network of pure SMAs with the absence of tight interchain entanglement as polymers. In this work, crystalline small molecule donors (SMDs), named TDZ&#8208;3TR and SeDZ&#8208;3TR, were designed and introduced into the L8&#8208;BO acceptor solution, forcing the phase separation and molecular fibrilization. SeDZ&#8208;3TR showed higher crystallinity and lower miscibility with L8&#8208;BO acceptor than TDZ&#8208;3TR, enabling more driving force to favor the phase separation and better molecular fibrilization of L8&#8208;BO. On the other hand, two donor polymers of PM6 and D18 with different fibril widths and lengths were put together to optimize the fibril network of the donor layer. The simultaneously optimization of the acceptor and donor layers resulted in a more ideal double&#8208;fibril network of the photoactive layer and an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.38&#8201;% in LbL&#8208;OSCs.

         <title>Chelating Additive Regulating Zn&#8208;Ion Solvation Chemistry for Highly Efficient Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two carbonyl groups of N&#8208;ac (N&#8208;Acetyl&#8208;&#1013;&#8208;caprolactam) chelating additive could coordinate with Zn2+ to maximally reduce the water molecules within Zn&#8208;ion solvation sheaths, thereby greatly inhibited water induced side&#8208;reactions and HER. Moreover, the N&#8208;ac additive can also preferentially adsorb on Zn (002) facets, thereby promote the highly reversible Zn2+ deposition and led to dendrite&#8208;free Zn&#8208;metal.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;metal batteries (AZMBs) usually suffered from poor reversibility and limited lifespan because of serious water induced side&#8208;reactions, hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and rampant zinc (Zn) dendrite growth. Reducing the content of water molecules within Zn&#8208;ion solvation sheaths can effectively suppress those inherent defects of AZMBs. In this work, we originally discovered that the two carbonyl groups of N&#8208;Acetyl&#8208;&#1013;&#8208;caprolactam (N&#8208;ac) chelating ligand can serve as dual solvation sites to coordinate with Zn2+, thereby minimizing water molecules within Zn&#8208;ion solvation sheaths, and greatly inhibit water&#8208;induced side&#8208;reactions and HER.

&lt;p&gt;The two carbonyl groups of N-ac (N-Acetyl-&#1013;-caprolactam) chelating additive could coordinate with Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to maximally reduce the water molecules within Zn-ion solvation sheaths, thereby greatly inhibited water induced side-reactions and HER. Moreover, the N-ac additive can also preferentially adsorb on Zn (002) facets, thereby promote the highly reversible Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; deposition and led to dendrite-free Zn-metal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous zinc-metal batteries (AZMBs) usually suffered from poor reversibility and limited lifespan because of serious water induced side-reactions, hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and rampant zinc (Zn) dendrite growth. Reducing the content of water molecules within Zn-ion solvation sheaths can effectively suppress those inherent defects of AZMBs. In this work, we originally discovered that the two carbonyl groups of N-Acetyl-&#1013;-caprolactam (N-ac) chelating ligand can serve as dual solvation sites to coordinate with Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, thereby minimizing water molecules within Zn-ion solvation sheaths, and greatly inhibit water-induced side-reactions and HER. Moreover, the N-ac chelating additive can form a unique physical barrier interface on Zn surface, preventing the harmful contacting with water. In addition, the preferential adsorption of N-ac on Zn (002) facets can promote highly reversible and dendrite-free Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; deposition. As a result, Zn//Cu half-cell within N-ac added electrolyte delivered ultra-high 99.89&#8201;% Coulombic efficiency during 8000&#8197;cycles. Zn//Zn symmetric cells also demonstrated unprecedented long life of more than 9800&#8197;hours (over one year). Aqueous Zn//ZnV&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;8H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (Zn//ZVO) full-cell preserved 78&#8201;% capacity even after ultra-long 2000&#8197;cycles. A more practical pouch-cell was also obtained (90.2&#8201;% capacity after 100&#8197;cycles).

         <title>Synergistic Palladium/Copper&#8208;Catalyzed 1,4&#8208;Difunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;Dienes for Stereodivergent Construction of 1,5&#8208;Nonadjacent Stereocenters</title>

         <dc:description>
A synergistic palladium/copper&#8208;catalyzed 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;dienes is reported for stereodivergent construction of 1,5&#8208;nonadjacent stereocenters. Mechanistic studies indicate a mechanism involving a Heck/Tsuji&#8211;Trost cascade. DFT calculations disclose that the palladium and copper catalysts separately control the newly formed stereocenters at C1 and C5.







Abstract
The construction of two distal stereocenters through a single catalytic process is of great interest in organic synthesis. While there are some successful reports regarding stereodivergent preparation of 1,3&#8208; or 1,4&#8208;stereocenters, the more challenged 1,5&#8208;nonadjacent stereocenters have never been achieved in a stereodivergent fashion. Herein we describe a synergistic palladium/copper catalysis for 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization reactions of 1,3&#8208;dienes, providing access to 1,5&#8208;nonadjacent quaternary stereocenters. Because each of the two catalysts separately controlled one of the newly formed stereocenters, stereodivergent synthesis of all four diastereomers of the products could readily be achieved simply by choosing an appropriate combination of chiral catalysts. Experimental and computational studies supported a mechanism involving a Heck/Tsuji&#8211;Trost cascade reaction, and the origins of the stereoselectivity were elucidated.

         <title>Fluorinated Polyimide Tunneling Layer for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new insulating and hydrophobic fluorinated polyimide was employed as the interface layer between perovskite and hole transport layer in perovskite solar cells. This insulating interface layer facilitates carrier transport via the tunneling effect while effectively passivating defects and providing field&#8208;effect passivation. The optimized devices attained a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 24.61&#8201;% and demonstrated excellent stability.







Abstract
Despite the remarkable progress of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), challenges remain in terms of finding effective and viable strategies to enhance their long&#8208;term stability while maintaining high efficiency. In this study, a new insulating and hydrophobic fluorinated polyimide (FPI: 6FDA&#8208;6FAPB) was used as the interface layer between the perovskite layer and the hole transport layer (HTL) in PSCs. The functional groups of FPI play a pivotal role in passivating interface defects within the device. Due to its high work function, FPI demonstrates field&#8208;effect passivation (FEP) capabilities as an interface layer, effectively mitigating non&#8208;radiative recombination at the interface. Notably, the FPI insulating interface layer does not impede carrier transmission at the interface, which is attributed to the presence of hole tunneling effects. The optimized PSCs achieve an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.61&#8201;% and demonstrate excellent stability, showcasing the efficacy of FPI in enhancing device performance and reliability.

We developed a new D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type polymer donor QQ1 via introducing a dithienoquinoxalineimide (DTQI) A unit. The binary QQ1&#8201;:&#8201;PY&#8208;IT and ternary QQ1&#8201;:&#8201;PY&#8208;IT&#8201;:&#8201;F&#8208;BTA3 all&#8208;PSCs present high PCEs of 18.81&#8201;% and 19.20&#8201;% respectively, benefiting from broad absorption range, reduced energy loss, and compact &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. These results provide new insight in the rational design of novel nonhalogenated polymer donors for further development of all&#8208;PSCs.







Abstract
All&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) have been regarded as one of the most promising candidates for commercial applications owing to their outstanding advantages such as mechanical flexibility, light weight and stable film morphology. However, compared to large amount of new&#8208;emerging excellent polymer acceptors, the development of high&#8208;performance polymer donor lags behind. Herein, a new D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type polymer donor, namely QQ1, was developed based on dithienoquinoxalineimide (DTQI) as the A unit, benzodithiophene with thiophene&#8208;conjugated side chains (BDTT) as the D unit, and alkyl&#8208;thiophene as the &#960;&#8208;bridge, respectively. QQ1 not only possesses a strong dipole moment, but also shows a wide band gap of 1.80&#8197;eV and a deep HOMO energy level of &#8722;5.47&#8197;eV, even without halogen substituents that are commonly indispensable for high&#8208;performance polymer donors. When blended with a classic polymer acceptor PY&#8208;IT, the QQ1&#8208;based all&#8208;PSC delivers an outstanding PCE of 18.81&#8201;%. After the introduction of F&#8208;BTA3 as the third component, a record PCE of 19.20&#8201;% was obtained, the highest value reported so far for all&#8208;PSCs. The impressive photovoltaic performance originates from broad absorption range, reduced energy loss, and compact &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. These results provide new insight in the rational design of novel nonhalogenated polymer donors for further development of all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Ruthenium Single Atomic Sites Surrounding the Support Pit with Exceptional Photocatalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of single&#8208;atomic Ru sites anchored on Ni(OH)x (SA&#8208;Ru/Ni(OH)x) with high content of vacancies and pits are synthesized by a photoreduction strategy. Single&#8208;atomic Ru sites are anchored on vacancies and near pits in SA&#8208;Ru/Ni(OH)x. Pits afford the adsorption of CO2 and Ru sites help with converting the as&#8208;adsorbed CO2, thus improving the catalytic performance of CO2RR.







Abstract
Single&#8208;metal atomic sites and vacancies can accelerate the transfer of photogenerated electrons and enhance photocatalytic performance in photocatalysis. In this study, a series of nickel hydroxide nanoboards (Ni(OH)x NBs) with different loadings of single&#8208;atomic Ru sites (w&#8208;SA&#8208;Ru/Ni(OH)x) were synthesized via a photoreduction strategy.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with experimental results revealed that CO2 can be adsorbed in the pits; single&#8208;atomic Ru sites can help with the conversion of as&#8208;adsorbed CO2 and lower the energy of *COOH formation accelerating the reaction; the excessive single&#8208;atomic Ru sites occupy vacancies that retard the completion of CO2RR.

&lt;p&gt;A series of single-atomic Ru sites anchored on Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; (SA-Ru/Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) with high content of vacancies and pits are synthesized by a photoreduction strategy. Single-atomic Ru sites are anchored on vacancies and near pits in SA-Ru/Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;. Pits afford the adsorption of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Ru sites help with converting the as-adsorbed CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, thus improving the catalytic performance of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR.

&lt;p&gt;Single-metal atomic sites and vacancies can accelerate the transfer of photogenerated electrons and enhance photocatalytic performance in photocatalysis. In this study, a series of nickel hydroxide nanoboards (Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; NBs) with different loadings of single-atomic Ru sites (&lt;i&gt;w&lt;/i&gt;-SA-Ru/Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) were synthesized via a photoreduction strategy. In such catalysts, single-atomic Ru sites are anchored to the vacancies surrounding the pits. Notably, the SA-Ru/Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; with 0.60&#8197;wt&#8201;% Ru loading (0.60-SA-Ru/Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) exhibits the highest catalytic performance (27.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) during the photocatalytic reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR).

         <title>Directed Electron Delivery from a Pb&#8208;Free Halide Perovskite to a Co(II) Molecular Catalyst Boosts CO2 Photoreduction Coupled with Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal halide photocatalyst immobilized with a molecular catalyst achieves an optimal performance for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion coupled with water oxidation to O2, which mainly benefits from the rapid directional electron transfer from the metal halide to the catalyst via its carboxyl anchors.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance photocatalytic systems for CO2 reduction is appealing to address energy and environmental issues, while it is challenging to avoid using toxic metals and organic sacrificial reagents. We here immobilize a family of cobalt phthalocyanine catalysts on Pb&#8208;free halide perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 nanosheets with delicate control on the anchors of the cobalt catalysts. Among them, the molecular hybrid photocatalyst assembled by carboxyl anchors achieves the optimal performance with an electron consumption rate of 300&#177;13&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion coupled with water oxidation to O2, over 8&#8197;times of the unmodified Cs2AgBiBr6 (36&#177;8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), also far surpassing the documented systems (&lt;150&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). Besides the improved intrinsic activity, electrochemical, computational, ex&#8208;/in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopic results indicate that the electrons photogenerated at the Bi atoms of Cs2AgBiBr6 can be directionally transferred to the cobalt catalyst via the carboxyl anchors which strongly bind to the Bi atoms, substantially facilitating the interfacial electron transfer kinetics and thereby the photocatalysis.

         <title>Cascade Reaction in Organic Hole Transport Layer Enables Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposed a new doping strategy by constructing a cascade reaction in organic hole transport layer (HTL) to achieve high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Owing to the dual functions of cascade reaction that is rapid and efficient oxidation and inhibition of sustained erosion from 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyridine to perovskite, the PSCs with Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD exhibit a champion power conversion efficiency of 25.76&#8201;% (certificated of 25.38&#8201;%) with good reproducibility and stability.







Abstract
The doped organic hole transport layer (HTL) is crucial for achieving high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the traditional doping strategy undergoes a time&#8208;consuming and environment&#8208;dependent oxidation process, which hinders the technology upgrades and commercialization of PSCs. Here, we reported a new strategy by introducing a cascade reaction in traditional doped Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, which can simultaneously achieve rapid oxidation and overcome the erosion of perovskite by 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyridine (tBP) in organic HTL. The ideal dopant iodobenzene diacetate was utilized as the initiator that can react with Spiro to generate Spiro&#8901;+ radicals quickly and efficiently without the participation of ambient air, with the byproduct of iodobenzene (DB). Then, the DB can coordinate with tBP through a halogen bond to form a tBP&#8208;DB complex, minimizing the sustained erosion from tBP to perovskite. Based on the above cascade reaction, the resulting Spiro&#8208;based PSCs have a champion PCE of 25.76&#8201;% (certificated of 25.38&#8201;%). This new oxidation process of HTL is less environment&#8208;dependent and produces PSCs with higher reproducibility. Moreover, the PTAA&#8208;based PSCs obtain a PCE of 23.76&#8201;%, demonstrating the excellent applicability of this doping strategy on organic HTL.

         <dc:description>
Hydrogen bond network breakdown in the CO2 photoreduction system can suppress H2 evolution and boost CO production, as reported by Chengcheng Liu, Weiqiao Deng et&#8197;al. in a Research Article (e202316991). Photosensitive poly(ionic liquid)s are designed as photocatalysts owing to their robust hydrogen bonding with solvents. The suppression of H2 evolution in photocatalytic CO2 reduction was effectively achieved by disrupting the hydrogen bond network with solvent additives.

Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are porous nanomaterials that offer exceptional biocompatibility and versatility for integrating proteins for biomedical applications. This minireview concisely discusses recent advancements in the chemistry and functionality of protein&#8208;HOF interfaces. It particularly focuses on strategic methodologies, such as the careful selection of building blocks and the genetic engineering of proteins, to facilitate protein&#8208;HOF interactions. We examine the role of enzyme encapsulation within HOFs, highlighting its capability to preserve enzyme function, a crucial aspect for applications in biosensing and disease diagnosis. Moreover, we discuss the emerging utility of nanoscale HOFs for intracellular protein delivery, illustrating their applicability as nanoreactors for intracellular catalysis and neuroprotective biorthogonal catalysis within cellular compartments. We highlight the significant advancement of designing biodegradable HOFs tailored for cytosolic protein delivery, underscoring their promising application in targeted cancer therapies. Finally, we provide a perspective viewpoint on the design of biocompatible protein&#8208;HOF assemblies, underlining their promising prospects in drug delivery, disease diagnosis, and broader biomedical applications.

         <title>Electrochemical CO2 Activation and Valorization on Metallic Copper and Carbon&#8208;Embedded N&#8208;Coordinated Single Metal MNC Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical reductive valorization of CO2 (CO2RR) has been studied and compared using copper surfaces and graphene&#8208;embedded, N&#8208;coordinated single metal atom (MNC) catalysts. This study explains the reaction mechanisms of CO2RR and identifies future challenges in optimizing catalyst design to improve efficiency and selectivity.







Abstract
The electrochemical reductive valorization of CO2, referred to as the CO2RR, is an emerging approach for the conversion of CO2&#8208;containing feeds into valuable carbonaceous fuels and chemicals, with potential contributions to carbon capture and use (CCU) for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Copper surfaces and graphene&#8208;embedded, N&#8208;coordinated single metal atom (MNC) catalysts exhibit distinctive reactivity, attracting attention as efficient electrocatalysts for CO2RR. This review offers a comparative analysis of CO2RR on copper surfaces and MNC catalysts, highlighting their unique characteristics in terms of CO2 activation, C1/C2(+) product formation, and the competing hydrogen evolution pathway. The assessment underscores the significance of understanding structure&#8211;activity relationships to optimize catalyst design for efficient and selective CO2RR. Examining detailed reaction mechanisms and structure&#8208;selectivity patterns, the analysis explores recent insights into changes in the chemical catalyst states, atomic motif rearrangements, and fractal agglomeration, providing essential kinetic information from advanced in/ex situ microscopy/spectroscopy techniques. At the end, this review addresses future challenges and solutions related to today's disconnect between our current molecular understanding of structure&#8211;activity&#8208;selectivity relations in CO2RR and the relevant factors controlling the performance of CO2 electrolyzers over longer times, with larger electrode sizes, and at higher current densities.

         <title>The Impact of Metagenomics on Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metagenomics generally involves isolation and extraction of DNA from various environmental samples, which can then be cloned and expressed into proteins of interest to address difficult chemical reactions in biocatalysis.







Abstract
In the ever&#8208;growing demand for sustainable ways to produce high&#8208;value small molecules, biocatalysis has come to the forefront of greener routes to these chemicals. As such, the need to constantly find and optimise suitable biocatalysts for specific transformations has never been greater. Metagenome mining has been shown to rapidly expand the toolkit of promiscuous enzymes needed for new transformations, without requiring protein engineering steps. If protein engineering is needed, the metagenomic candidate can often provide a better starting point for engineering than a previously discovered enzyme on the open database or from literature, for instance. In this review, we highlight where metagenomics has made substantial impact on the area of biocatalysis in recent years. We review the discovery of enzymes in previously unexplored or &#8216;hidden&#8217; sequence space, leading to the characterisation of enzymes with enhanced properties that originate from natural selection pressures in native environments.

         <title>Recent Advances in Dearomative Partial Reduction of Benzenoid Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dearomative partial reduction of benzenoid arenes, historically used for reactions like the Birch reduction and Crich addition, has experienced a significant revival with the advent of electrochemistry and photochemistry. Recent advances in this area are depicted, highlighting reduction processes such as dihydrogenation, hydroalkylation, and other hydrofunctionalizations, while also showcasing their applications in natural product synthesis.







Abstract
Dearomative partial reduction is an extraordinary approach for transforming benzenoid arenes and has been well&#8208;known for many decades, as exemplified by the dehydrogenation of Birch reduction and the hydroarylation of Crich addition. Despite its remarkable importance in synthesis, this field has experienced slow progress over the last half&#8208;century. However, a revival has been observed with the recent introduction of electrochemical and photochemical methods. In this Minireview, we summarize the recent advancements in dearomative partial reduction of benzenoid arenes, including dihydrogenation, hydroalkylation, arylation, alkenylation, amination, borylation and others. Further, the intriguing utilization of dearomative partial reduction in the synthesis of natural products is also emphasized. It is anticipated that this Minireview will stimulate further progress in arene dearomative transformations.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Enabled Cycloaddition of Bicyclobutanes with Isocyanides for the Synthesis of Polysubstituted 3&#8208;Azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A remarkably simple silver&#8208;enabled strategy to access polysubstituted 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes in a single operation from readily accessible bicyclobutanes and isocyanides has been developed. This novel protocol allows for rapid generation of molecular complexity from simple starting materials, and the products can be subjected to diverse downstream transformations, offering opportunities for the exploration of new sp3&#8208;rich chemical space.







Abstract
Synthesis of bicyclic scaffolds has emerged as an important research topic in modern drug development because they can serve as saturated bioisosters to enhance the physicochemical properties and metabolic profiles of drug candidates. Here we report a remarkably simple silver&#8208;enabled strategy to access polysubstituted 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes in a single operation from readily accessible bicyclobutanes (BCBs) and isocyanides. The process is proposed to involve a formal (3+3)/(3+2)/retro&#8208;(3+2) cycloaddition sequence. This novel protocol allows for rapid generation of molecular complexity from simple starting materials, and the products can be easily derivatized, further enriching the BCB cycloaddition chemistry and the growing set of valuable sp3&#8208;rich bicyclic building blocks.

         <title>The Celiac&#8208;Disease Superantigen Oligomerizes and Increases Permeability in an Enterocyte Cell Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 33&#8208;mer deamidated gliadin peptide is formed in active celiac disease and related to T&#8208;cell activation. We determined its oligomeric nature and found a significant increase in gut epithelial permeability mediated by the tight junction protein zonula occludens&#8208;1. These findings shed light on this pathological peptide and its oligomers and have implications for advancing our understanding and treatment of celiac disease.







Abstract
Celiac disease (CeD) is an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten proteins, affecting approximately 1&#8201;% of the global population. The 33&#8208;mer deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP) is a metabolically modified wheat&#8208;gluten superantigen for CeD. Here, we demonstrate that the 33&#8208;mer DGP spontaneously assembles into oligomers with a diameter of approximately 24&#8197;nm. The 33&#8208;mer DGP oligomers present two main secondary structural motifs&#8211;a major polyproline II helix and a minor &#946;&#8208;sheet structure. Importantly, in the presence of 33&#8208;mer DGP oligomers, there is a statistically significant increase in the permeability in the gut epithelial cell model Caco&#8208;2, accompanied by the redistribution of zonula occludens&#8208;1, a master tight junction protein. These findings provide novel molecular and supramolecular insights into the impact of 33&#8208;mer DGP in CeD and highlight the relevance of gliadin peptide oligomerization.

         <title>Electrochemiluminescence of a First&#8208;Row d6 Transition Metal Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chromium(0) complex was explored as an earth&#8208;abundant 3d6 alternative to the precious metal complexes that dominate electrochemiluminescence (ECL) detection. A sufficiently reactive intermediate for chemi&#8208;excitation was obtained by reduction of Ir(ppy)3, providing a multi&#8208;colour ECL system in which the ratio of the two spectrally distinct emissions can be controlled through the applied potential.







Abstract
We report the electrochemiluminescence (ECL) of a 3d6 Cr(0) complex ([Cr(LMes)3]; &#955;em=735&#8197;nm) with comparable photophysical properties to those of ECL&#8208;active complexes of 4d6 or 5d6 precious metal ions. The electrochemical potentials of [Cr(LMes)3] are more negative than those of [Ir(ppy)3] and render the [Cr(LMes)3]* excited state inaccessible through conventional co&#8208;reactant ECL with tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine or oxalate. ECL can be obtained, however, through the annihilation route in which potentials sufficient to oxidise and reduce the luminophore are alternately applied. When combined with [Ir(ppy)3] (&#955;em=520&#8197;nm), the annihilation ECL of [Cr(LMes)3] was greatly enhanced whereas that of [Ir(ppy)3] was diminished. Under appropriate conditions, the relative intensities of the two spectrally distinct emissions can be controlled through the applied potentials. From this starting point for ECL with 3d6 metal complexes, we discuss some directions for future development.

         <title>Superoxide Radicals in Uranyl Peroxide Solids: Lasting Signatures Identified by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>

U(VI) peroxide phases synthesized between 1945&#8211;2023 contained the superoxide radical with the number of spins related to the specific activity of the uranium X age.







Abstract
U(VI) peroxide phases (studtite and meta&#8208;studtite) are found throughout the nuclear fuel cycle and exist as corrosion products in high radiation fields. Peroxides are part of a family of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that include hydroperoxyl and superoxide species and are produced during alpha radiolysis of water. While U(VI) peroxides have been thoroughly investigated, the incorporation and stability of ROS species within studtite have not been validated. In the current study, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was used to identify the presence of free radicals within a series of U(VI) peroxide samples containing depleted, highly enriched, and natural uranium. Density functional theory calculations indicated that the predicted EPR signals matched well with a superoxide (O2&#8722;&#8901;) species incorporated into the studtite structure, confirming the presence of ROS in the material. Further analysis of samples that were synthesized between 1945 and 2023 indicated that there is a correlation between the radical signal and the product of specific activity multiplied by age of the sample.

         <title>A Stoichiometric Haloform Coupling for Ester Synthesis with Secondary Alcohols</title>

         <dc:description>
A general haloform coupling reaction for the synthesis of esters from methyl ketones is reported using one equivalent of alcohol. Detailed kinetic modelling studies demonstrate that the key intermediates are formed under equilibrium, which led to the development of conditions that are amenable to secondary alcohols.

Abstract
The haloform reaction from methyl ketones to carboxylic acids is one of the oldest known synthetic organic reactions, which has been used in myriad applications over the decades. The corresponding reaction to produce esters is, however, less developed, as the reaction is generally limited to simple, primary alcohols that are used in solvent&#8208;level quantities, thereby restricting the complexity of esters that can be directly formed. Herein, we detail the development of a general ester&#8208;forming haloform coupling reaction using one equivalent of alcohol. Mechanistic and kinetic modelling studies demonstrated that the key intermediates are formed under equilibrium, which facilitated the development of conditions that are amenable to secondary alcohols.

         <title>A Lipopeptidomimetic of Transcriptional Activation Domains Selectively Disrupts the Coactivator Med25 Protein&#8211;Protein Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A short, amphipathic peptide derived from transcriptional activators is transformed from a weak inhibitor of transcriptional protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPIs) to an effective inhibitor through the addition of a chiral, medium&#8208;length lipid. The resulting lipopeptidomimetic (8) selectively blocks Med25 PPIs in vitro, stabilizes full&#8208;length protein, and down&#8208;regulates a key Med25&#8208;dependent gene.







Abstract
Short amphipathic peptides are capable of binding to transcriptional coactivators, often targeting the same binding surfaces as native transcriptional activation domains. However, they do so with modest affinity and generally poor selectivity, limiting their utility as synthetic modulators. Here we show that incorporation of a medium&#8208;chain, branched fatty acid to the N&#8208;terminus of one such heptameric lipopeptidomimetic (LPPM&#8208;8) increases the affinity for the coactivator Med25 &gt;20&#8208;fold (Ki &gt;100&#8197;&#956;M to 4&#8197;&#956;M), rendering it an effective inhibitor of Med25 protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPIs). The lipid structure, the peptide sequence, and the C&#8208;terminal functionalization of the lipopeptidomimetic each influence the structural propensity of LPPM&#8208;8 and its effectiveness as an inhibitor. LPPM&#8208;8 engages Med25 through interaction with the H2 face of its activator interaction domain and in doing so stabilizes full&#8208;length protein in the cellular proteome. Further, genes regulated by Med25&#8208;activator PPIs are inhibited in a cell model of triple&#8208;negative breast cancer. Thus, LPPM&#8208;8 is a useful tool for studying Med25 and mediator complex biology and the results indicate that lipopeptidomimetics may be a robust source of inhibitors for activator&#8208;coactivator complexes.

         <title>Total Synthesis of the Euphorbia Diterpenoid Pepluacetal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategic utilization of a Wolff rearrangement/lactonization cascade reaction, a ring&#8208;closing metathesis/cyclopropanation protocol, and a transannular C(sp3)&#8722;H insertion/Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation/ring&#8208;opening sequence enabled the first total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208; and (+)&#8208;pepluacetal. The synthesis also features the control of concave&#8208;face bond formation and the application of a remote traceless stereochemical relay strategy.







Abstract
The first total synthesis of the Euphorbia diterpenoid pepluacetal is disclosed in both racemic and chiral fashions. The synthesis strategically relies on a photo&#8208;induced Wolff rearrangement/lactonization cascade (WRLC) reaction to access the cyclobutane moiety, a ring&#8208;closing metathesis/cyclopropanation sequence to rapidly forge the 7&#8211;3&#8197;bicyclic system, and a late&#8208;stage Rh&#8208;catalyzed transannular carbenoid insertion to C(sp3)&#8722;H bond followed by a Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation and ring&#8208;opening manipulations to install the side chain. The synthetic route demonstrates excellent stereochemical control on the non&#8208;classical concave&#8208;face bond formation, remote traceless stereochemical relay and high scalability to provide 20&#8197;mg of (+)&#8208;pepluacetal.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light Activated Formulation for the Spatially Controlled Release of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 Ribonucleoprotein for Brain Gene Editing</title>

A nanoparticle formulation, using oligonucleotide chemistry, able to release a gene editing system with single cell resolution after near infrared laser activation. The full potential of the formulation was demonstrated in the brain after intracerebral and intranasal administrations. The spot of the laser defined the region of gene editing.







Abstract
The CRISPR/Cas9 system has emerged as a promising platform for gene editing; however, the lack of an efficient and safe delivery system to introduce it into cells continues to hinder clinical translation. Here, we report a rationally designed gene&#8208;editing nanoparticle (NP) formulation for brain applications: an sgRNA:Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complex is immobilized on the NP surface by oligonucleotides that are complementary to the sgRNA. Irradiation of the formulation with a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser generates heat in the NP, leading to the release of the ribonucleoprotein complex. The gene&#8208;editing potential of the formulation was demonstrated in vitro at the single&#8208;cell level. The safety and gene editing of the formulation were also demonstrated in the brains of reporter mice, specifically in the subventricular zone after intracerebral administration and in the olfactory bulb after intranasal administration. The formulation presented here offers a new strategy for the spatially controlled delivery of the CRISPR system to the brain.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CRISPR/Cas9 system has emerged as a promising platform for gene editing; however, the lack of an efficient and safe delivery system to introduce it into cells continues to hinder clinical translation. Here, we report a rationally designed gene-editing nanoparticle (NP) formulation for brain applications: an sgRNA:Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complex is immobilized on the NP surface by oligonucleotides that are complementary to the sgRNA. Irradiation of the formulation with a near-infrared (NIR) laser generates heat in the NP, leading to the release of the ribonucleoprotein complex. The gene-editing potential of the formulation was demonstrated &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; at the single-cell level. The safety and gene editing of the formulation were also demonstrated in the brains of reporter mice, specifically in the subventricular zone after intracerebral administration and in the olfactory bulb after intranasal administration. The formulation presented here offers a new strategy for the spatially controlled delivery of the CRISPR system to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modular Design of Highly Stable Semiconducting Porous Coordination Polymer for Efficient Electrosynthesis of Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semiconductive PCP with excellent chemical and thermal stability was constructed using the &#8220;modular design&#8221; approach. The Fe&#8208;pyNDI exhibits a well&#8208;defined structure and shows promise as a new platform for investigating electrocatalysts for superior catalytic performance in reducing nitrate to ammonia. In&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectra analysis during the reaction revealed that some of the Fe3+ present in Fe&#8208;pyNDI underwent reduction to Fe2+, which serves as a potential active species for the nitrate reduction reaction.







Abstract
Developing highly stable porous coordination polymers (PCPs) with integrated electrical conductivity is crucial for advancing our understanding of electrocatalytic mechanisms and the structure&#8211;activity relationship of electrocatalysts. However, achieving this goal remains a formidable challenge because of the electrochemical instability observed in most PCPs. Herein, we develop a &#8220;modular design&#8221; strategy to construct electrochemically stable semiconducting PCP, namely, Fe&#8208;pyNDI, which incorporates a chain&#8208;type Fe&#8208;pyrazole metal cluster and &#960;&#8208;stacking column with effective synergistic effects. The three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) technique resolves the precise structure. Both theoretical and experimental investigation confirms that the &#960;&#8208;stacking column in Fe&#8208;pyNDI can provide an efficient electron transport path and enhance the structural stability of the material. As a result, Fe&#8208;pyNDI can serve as an efficient model electrocatalyst for nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) to ammonia with a superior ammonia yield of 339.2&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (14677&#8197;&#956;g&#8197;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1) and a faradaic efficiency of 87&#8201;% at neutral electrolyte, which is comparable to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. The in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveals that during the reaction, the structure of Fe&#8208;pyNDI can be kept, while part of the Fe3+ in Fe&#8208;pyNDI was reduced in situ to Fe2+, which serves as the potential active species for NO3RR.

         <title>Ynamide and Azaalleneyl. Acid&#8208;Base Promoted Chelotropic and Spin&#8208;State Rearrangements in a Versatile Heterocumulene [(Ad)NCC(tBu)]&#8722;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this communication, we highlight the chelotropic rearrangement of a relatively rare heterocumulene, [(Ad)NCC(tBu)]&#8722; on a [VIII] core from &#954;1&#8208;N&#8208;ynamide to a &#954;2&#8208;C,N&#8208;azaalleneyl and vice versa, with an accompanying change in the spin&#8208;state of the metal ion. Our system demonstrates how Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;base chemistry can trigger, reversibly, chelotropic rearrangements along with significant spin&#8208;state changes.







Abstract
We introduce the heterocumulene ligand [(Ad)NCC(tBu)]&#8722; (Ad=1&#8208;adamantyl (C10H15), tBu=tert&#8208;butyl, (C4H9)), which can adopt two forms, the azaalleneyl and ynamide. This ligand platform can undergo a reversible chelotropic shift using Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;base chemistry, which promotes an unprecedented spin&#8208;state change of the [VIII] ion. These unique scaffolds are prepared via addition of 1&#8208;adamantyl isonitrile (C&#8801;NAd) across the alkylidyne in complexes [(BDI)V&#8801;CtBu(OTf)] (A) (BDI&#8722;=ArNC(CH3)CHC(CH3)NAr), Ar=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) and [(dBDI)V&#8801;CtBu(OEt2)] (B) (dBDI2&#8722;=ArNC(CH3)CHC(CH2)NAr). Complex A reacts with C&#8801;NAd, to generate the high&#8208;spin [VIII] complex with a &#954;1&#8208;N&#8208;ynamide ligand, [(BDI)V{&#954;1&#8208;N&#8208;(Ad)NCC(tBu)}(OTf)] (1). Conversely, B reacts with C&#8801;NAd to generate a low&#8208;spin [VIII] diamagnetic complex having a chelated &#954;2&#8208;C,N&#8208;azaalleneyl ligand, [(dBDI)V{&#954;2&#8208;N,C&#8208;(Ad)NCC(tBu)}] (2). Theoretical studies have been applied to better understand the mechanism of formation of 2 and the electronic reconfiguration upon structural rearrangement by the alteration of ligand denticity between 1 and 2.

         <title>Peroxygenase&#8208;Enabled Reductive Kinetic Resolution for the Enantioenrichment of Organoperoxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peroxygenase from Agrocybe aegerita has been shown to be a robust and selective catalyst for the reductive kinetic resolution of racemic organoperoxides, whereby a broad range of optically pure (S)&#8208;organoperoxides was produced. It is also possible to obtain (R)&#8208;organoperoxides by using commercially available peroxygenases.







Abstract
Enantiomerically pure organoperoxides serve as valuable precursors in organic transformations. Herein, we present the first examples of unspecific peroxygenase catalyzed kinetic resolution of racemic organoperoxides through asymmetric reduction. Through meticulous investigation of the reaction conditions, it is shown that the unspecific peroxygenase from Agrocybe aegerita (AaeUPO) exhibits robust catalytic activity in the kinetic resolution reactions of the model substrate with turnover numbers up to 60000 and turnover frequency of 5.6&#8197;s&#8722;1. Various aralkyl organoperoxides were successfully resolved by AaeUPO, achieving excellent enantioselectivities (e.g., up to 99&#8201;% ee for the (S)&#8208;organoperoxide products). Additionally, we screened commercial peroxygenase variants to obtain the organoperoxides with complementary chirality, with one mutant yielding the (R)&#8208;products. While unspecific peroxygenases have been extensively demonstrated as a powerful oxidative catalysts, this study highlights their usefulness in catalyzing the reduction of organoperoxides and providing versatile chiral synthons.

         <title>Lewis Acid Decorated Hexacyanodiborane(6) Dianion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
First examples of functionalization of diborane(6) dianions are presented, resulting in a novel weakly coordinating dianion decorated with tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane units and a neutral silylated hexacyanodiborane(6) derivative. These diborane(6) compounds are thermally very robust and possess remarkable oxidative stability.







Abstract
First examples of diborane(6) dianions decorated with weakly coordination B(C6F5)3 (BCF) groups and SiEt3+ moieties have been synthesized demonstrating the synthetic potential of the [B2(CN)6]2&#8722; dianion. [B2{CNB(C6F5)3}6]2&#8722; (1) was isolated as potassium and tetrabutylammonium salt. 1 is a rare example for a weakly coordinating dianion and it was used for the stabilization of the carbocation [Ph3C]+ and the oxonium acid [H(OEt2)2]+. Reaction of [Ph3C]21 with HSiEt3 resulted in the silylated neutral diborane(6) [B2{CNB(C6F5)3}4(CNSiEt3)2] (2) in which two BCF groups have been selectively replaced by SiEt3+ substituents, underscoring the stability and chemical versatility of the [B2(CN)6]2&#8722; dianion. The chemical properties and physicochemical data of 1 and 2 provide insight into electronic, coordinating, and steric properties of theses novel diborane(6) compounds.

         <title>Experimental Evidence for Non&#8208;Fermi&#8208;Contact J Coupling Across Chalcogen Bonds in Ionic Salt Cocrystal Polymorphs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental evidence for non&#8208;Fermi&#8208;contact contributions to J couplings across chalcogen bonds is presented for a pair of newly discovered ionic cocrystal polymorphs. Large and anisotropic J(125Te, 79/81Br) coupling and 79/81Br quadrupolar coupling tensor magnitudes measured via 125Te and 79/81Br solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy provide new experimental insight into the nature of the chalcogen bond.







Abstract
A pair of novel polymorphic ionic cocrystals of 3,4&#8208;dicyanotelluradiazole and tetraphenylphosphonium bromide are synthesized and are characterized by single&#8208;crystal XRD. Strong and directional non&#8208;covalent chalcogen bonds (ChB) between Te and Br are analyzed via solid&#8208;state NMR to reveal large and anisotropic J(125Te,79/81Br) coupling tensors, providing unequivocal evidence for non&#8208;Fermi contact contributions across ChBs. Along with large 79/81Br quadrupolar couplings for the Br&#8722; anions, these data provide new tools to characterize chalcogen bonds and to differentiate between ChB polymorphs.

         <title>Induced Chirality in Canthaxanthin Aggregates Reveals Multiple Levels of Supramolecular Organization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixing chiral polysaccharides with the achiral carotenoid canthaxanthin (CAX) leads to a unique chirality induction, with strong optical activity visible in the electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and resonance Raman optical activity (RROA) spectra. Interpretation of the data using density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) modelling suggests an intricate supramolecular structure with multiple carotenoid&#8211;carotenoid interactions.







Abstract
Carotenoids tend to form supramolecular aggregates via non&#8208;covalent interactions where the chirality of individual molecules is amplified to the macroscopic level. We show that this can also be achieved for non&#8208;chiral carotenoid monomers interacting with polysaccharides. The chirality induction in canthaxanthin (CAX), caused by heparin (HP) and hyaluronic acid (HA), was monitored by chiroptical spectroscopy. Electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and Raman optical activity (ROA) spectra indicated the presence of multiple carotenoid formations, such as H&#8208; and J&#8208;type aggregates. This is consistent with molecular dynamics (MD) and density functional theory (DFT) simulations of the supramolecular structures and their spectroscopic response.

         <title>Bypassing Ammonia: From N2 to Nitrogen Heterocycles without N1 Intermediates or Transition Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 21, May 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new heterocyclic species are prepared from diboradiazene compounds, thus completing two&#8208;step routes to complex N&#8208;heterocycles from N2 that both circumvent the need for transition metal reagents and completely bypass the traditional intermediate ammonia.







Abstract
Diboradiazene compounds, derived in one step from the boron&#8208;mediated reduction of dinitrogen (N2), were treated separately with sulfur and acetic anhydride, providing heterocyclic compounds that are BN isosteres of thiophene and 1,3&#8208;oxazole, respectively. These simple reactions represent the final steps in two&#8208;step routes to complex heterocycles from N2 that both circumvent the need for transition metal reagents and completely bypass the traditional intermediate ammonia.

         <title>Leveraging DNA&#8208;encoded Cell&#8208;mimics for Environment&#8208;adaptive Transmembrane Channel Release&#8208;induced Cell Death</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The advancement of cell&#8208;mimic materials, which can forge sophisticated physicochemical dialogues with living cells, has unlocked a realm of intriguing prospects within the fields of synthetic biology and biomedical engineering. Inspired by the evolutionarily acquired ability of T lymphocytes to release perforin and generate transmembrane channels on targeted cells for killing, herein we present a pioneering DNA&#8208;encoded artificial T cell mimic model (ARTC) that accurately mimics T&#8208;cell&#8208;like behavior. ARTC responds to acidic conditions similar to those found in the tumor microenvironment and then selectively releases a G&#8208;rich DNA strand (LG4) embedded with C12 lipid and cholesterol molecules. Once released, LG4 effectively integrates into the membranes of neighboring live cells, behaving as an artificial transmembrane channel that selectively transports K+ ions and disrupts cellular homeostasis, ultimately inducing apoptosis. We hope that the emergence of ARTC will usher in new perspectives for revolutionizing future disease treatment and catalyzing the development of advanced biomedical technologies</dc:description>

         <title>Protonation of an Imine&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient H2O2 Photosynthesis under Visible Light up to 700 nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising photocatalysts for H2O2 production from water via oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). The design of COFs for efficient H2O2 production indubitably hinges on an in&#8208;depth understanding of their ORR mechanisms. In this work, taking an imine&#8208;linked COF as an example, we demonstrate that protonation of the functional units such as imine, amine, and triazine, is a highly efficient strategy to upgrade the activity levels for H2O2 synthesis. The protonation not only extends the light absorption of the COF but also provides proton sources that directly participate in H2O2 generation. Notably, the protonation simplifies the reaction pathways of ORR to H2O2, i.e. from an indirect superoxide radical ([[EQUATION]]) mediated route to a direct one&#8208;step two&#8208;electron route. Theoretical calculations confirm that the protonation favors H2O2 synthesis due to easy access of protons near the reaction sites that removes the energy barrier for generating *OOH intermediate. These findings not only extend the mechanistic insight into H2O2 photosynthesis but also provide a rational guideline for the design and upgradation of efficient COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Stepwise Protonation of Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhancing Hydrogen Peroxide Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs), recognized for their tailorable structures and accessible active sites, offer a promising platform for developing advanced photocatalysts. However, the difficulty in the synthesis and functionalization of 3D COFs hinders their further development. In this study, we present a series of 3D&#8208;bcu&#8208;COFs with 8 connected porphyrin units linked by linear linkers through imine bonds as a versatile platform for photocatalyst design. The photoresponse of 3D&#8208;bcu&#8208;COFs was initially modulated by functionalizing linear linkers with benzo&#8208;thiadiazole or benzo&#8208;selenadiazole groups. Furthermore, taking advantage of the well&#8208;exposed porphyrin and imine sites in 3D&#8208;bcu&#8208;COFs, their photocatalytic activity was optimized by stepwise protonation of imine bonds and porphyrin centers. The dual protonated COF with benzo&#8208;selenadiazole groups exhibited enhanced charge separation, leading to an increased photocatalytic H2O2 production under visible light. This enhancement demonstrates the combined benefits of linker functionalization and stepwise protonation on photocatalytic efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Self&#8208;Assembly of Heterometallic [2]Catenanes and Cyclic Bis[2]catenanes via Orthogonal Metal&#8208;Coordination Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although catenated cages have been widely constructed due to their unique and elegant topological structures, cyclic catenanes formed by the connection of multiple catenane units have been rarely reported. Herein, based on the orthogonal metal&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, we prepare a series of heterometallic [2]catenanes and cyclic bis[2]catenanes, whose structures are clearly evidenced by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Owing to the multiple positively charged nature, as well as the potential synergistic effect of the Cu(I) and Pt(II) metal ions, the cyclic bis[2]catenanes display broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity. This work not only provides an efficient strategy for the construction of heterometallic [2]catenanes and cyclic bis[2]catenanes but also explores their applications as superior antibacterial agents, which will promote the construction of advanced supramolecular structures for biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid oxide electrolysis cells are prospective approaches for CO2 utilization but face significant challenges due to the sluggish reaction kinetics and poor stability of the fuel electrodes. Herein, we strategically addressed the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off phenomenon between enhanced exsolution and improved structural stability via topotactic ion exchange. The surface dynamic reconstruction of the MnOx/La0.7Sr0.3Cr0.9Ir0.1O3&#8208;&#948; (LSCIr) catalyst was visualized at the atomic scale. Compared with the Ir@LSCIr interface, the in situ self&#8208;assembled Ir@MnOx/LSCIr interface exhibited greater CO2 activation and easily removable carbonate intermediates, thus reached a 42% improvement in CO2 electrolysis performance at 1.6 V. Furthermore, an improved CO2 electrolysis stability was achieved due to the uniformly wrapped MnOx shell of the Ir@MnOx/LSCIr cathode. Our approach enables a detailed understanding of the dynamic microstructure evolution at active interfaces and provides a roadmap for the rational design and evaluation of efficient metal/oxide catalysts for CO2 electrolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorophilic Sigma(&#963;)&#8208;Lock Self&#8208;Healable Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although F&#8208;containing molecules and macromolecules are often used in molecular biology to increase the binding with Lewis acidic groups by introducing favorable C&#8208;F dipoles, there is virtually no experimental evidence and limited understanding of the nature of these interactions, especially their role in synthetic polymeric materials. These studies elucidate the molecular origin of inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;chain interactions responsible for self&#8208;healing of F&#8208;containing copolymers composed of pentafluorostyrene and n&#8208;butyl acrylate units (p(PFS/nBA). Guided by dynamic surface oscillating force (SOF) and spectroscopic measurements supported by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, these studies show that the reformation of&#160;&#963;&#8208;&#963;&#160;orbitals in &#8208;C&#8208;F of PFS and CH3CH2&#8208; of nBA units enables the recovery of entropic energy via&#160;flouorophilic&#8208;&#963;&#8208;lock&#160;van der Waals forces when PFS/nBA molar ratios are ~50/50. The strength of these interactions determined experimentally for self&#8208;healable PFS/nBA compositions is in the order ~0.3 kcal/mol which primarily comes from&#160;flouorophilic&#8208;&#963;&#8208;lock&#160;(~70%) contributions. These interactions are significantly diminished for non&#8208;self&#8208;healable counterparts. Strongly polarized &#8208;C&#8208;F&#160;&#963;&#160;orbitals create lateral dipolar forces enhancing the affinity towards &#8208;C&#8208;H orbitals, facilitating energetically favorable interactions. Entropic recovery driven by non&#8208;covalent bonding offers a valuable tool in designing materials with unique functionalities, particularly self&#8208;healable batteries or other&#160;energy storage devices.</dc:description>

Entropic recovery driven by non-covalent bonding offers a valuable tool in designing materials with unique functionalities, particularly self-healable batteries or other&#160;energy storage devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Scalable Precise Nanofilm Coating and Gradient Al Doping Enable Stable Battery Cycling of LiCoO2 at 4.7 V</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The quest for smart electronics with higher energy densities has intensified the development of high&#8208;voltage LiCoO2 (LCO). Despite their potential, LCO materials operating at 4.7 V faces critical challenges, including interface degradation and structural collapse. Herein, we propose a collective surface architecture through precise nanofilm coating and doping that combines an ultra&#8208;thin LiAlO2 coating layer and gradient doping of Al. This architecture not only mitigates side reactions, but also improves the Li+ migration kinetics on the LCO surface. Meanwhile, gradient doping of Al inhibited the severe lattice distortion caused by the irreversible phase transition of O3&#8208;H1&#8208;3&#8208;O1, thereby enhanced the electrochemical stability of LCO during 4.7 V cycling. DFT calculations further revealed that our approach significantly boosts the electronic conductivity. As a result, the modified LCO exhibited an outstanding reversible capacity of 230 mAh g&#8208;1 at 4.7 V, which is approximately 28% higher than the conventional capacity at 4.5 V. To demonstrate their practical application, our cathode structure shows improved stability in full pouch cell configuration under high operating voltage. LCO exhibited an excellent cycling stability, retaining 82.33% after 1000 cycles at 4.5 V. This multifunctional surface modification strategy offers a viable pathway for the practical application of LCO materials.</dc:description>

         <title>An Alkyne&#8208;bridged Covalent Organic Framework Featuring Interactive Pockets for Bromine Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high degree of corrosivity and reactivity of bromine, which is released from various sources poses a serious threat to the environment. Moreover, its coexistence with iodine forming an equilibrium compound, iodine monobromide (IBr) necessitates the selective capture of bromine from halogen mixtures. The electrophilicity of halogens to &#960;&#8208;electron rich structures enabled us to strategically design a covalent organic framework for halogen capture, featuring a defined pore environment with localized sorption sites. The higher capture capacity of bromine (4.6&#160;g&#160;g&#8208;1) over iodine by ~41&#160;% shows its potential in selective capture. Spectroscopic results uncovering the preferential interaction sites are supported by theoretical investigations. The alkyne bridge is a core functionality promoting the selectivity in capture by synergistic physisorption, rationalized by the higher orbital overlap of bromine due to its smaller atomic size as well as reversible chemical interactions. The slip stacking in the structure has further promoted this phenomenon by creating clusters of molecular interaction sites with bromine intercalated between the layers. The inclusion of unsaturated moieties, i.e. triple bonds and the complementary pore geometry offer a promising design strategy for the construction of porous materials for halogen capture.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Enzymatic Synthesis of Carbamates in Water Using Promiscuous Esterases/Acyltransferases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biocatalysis provides an attractive approach to facilitate synthetic reactions in aqueous media. Motivated by the discovery of promiscuous aminolysis activity of esterases, we exploited the esterase from&#160;Pyrobaculum calidifontis&#160;VA1 (PestE) for the synthesis of carbamates from different aliphatic, aromatic, and arylaliphatic amines and a set of carbonates such as dimethyl&#8208;, dibenzyl&#8208;, or diallyl carbonate. Thus, aniline and benzylamine derivatives, aliphatic and even secondary amines could be efficiently converted into the corresponding&#160;benzyloxycarbonyl&#160;(Cbz)&#8208; or allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc)&#8208;protected products in bulk water, with (isolated) yields of up to 99%.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantification of native lignin structural features with gel&#8208;phase 2D&#8208;HSQC0 reveals lignin structural changes during extraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Our ability to study and valorize the lignin fraction of biomass is hampered by the fundamental and still unmet challenge of precisely quantifying native lignin&#8217;s structural features. Here, we developed a rapid elevated&#8208;temperature 1H&#8211;13C Heteronuclear Single&#8208;Quantum Coherence Zero (HSQC0) NMR method that enables this precise quantification of native lignin structural characteristics even with whole plant cell wall (WPCW) NMR spectroscopy, overcoming fast spin relaxation in the gel phase. We also formulated a Gaussian fitting algorithm to perform automatic and reliable spectral integration. By combining HSQC0 measurements with yield measurements following depolymerization, we can confirm the combinatorial nature of radical coupling reactions during biosynthesis leading to a random sequential organization of linkages within a largely linear lignin chain. Such analyses illustrate how this analytical method can greatly facilitate the study of native lignin structure, which can then be used for fundamental studies or to understand lignin depolymerization methods like reductive catalytic fractionation or aldehyde&#8208;assisted fractionation.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling Stoichiometry Effect in Nickel&#8208;Tungsten Alloys for Efficient Hydrogen Oxidation Catalysis in Alkaline Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells provide the possibility to use platinum group metal&#8208;free catalysts, but the anodic hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) suffers from sluggish kinetics and its source is still debated. Here, over nickel&#8208;tungsten (Ni&#8208;W) alloy catalysts, we show that the Ni:W ratio greatly governs the HOR performance in alkaline electrolyte. Experimental and theoretical studies unravel that alloying with W can tune the unpaired electrons in Ni, tailoring the potential of zero charge and the catalytic surface to favor hydroxyl adsorption (OHad). The OHad species coordinately interact with potassium (K+) ions, which break the K+ solvation sheath to leave free water molecules, yielding an improved connectivity of hydrogen&#8208;bond networks. Consequently, the optimal Ni17W3 alloy exhibits alkaline HOR activity superior to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art platinum on carbon (Pt/C) catalyst and operates steadily with negligible decay after 10,000 cycles. Our findings offer new understandings of alloyed HOR catalysts and will guide rational design of next&#8208;generation catalysts for fuel cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Near&#8208;Infrared Circularly Polarized Luminescence Encoded by Transient Supramolecular Chiral Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is promising for applications in many fields. However, most systems involving CPL are within the visible range; near&#8210;infrared (NIR) CPL&#8210;active materials, especially those that exhibit high glum values and can be controlled spatially and temporally, are rare. Herein, dynamic NIR&#8210;CPL with a glum value of 2.5[[EQUATION]]10&#8210;2 was achieved through supramolecular coassembly and energy transfer strategies. The chiral assemblies formed by the coassembly between adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and a pyrene derivative exhibit a red CPL signal (glum of 10&#8210;3). The further introduction of sulfo&#8210;cyanine5 resulted in a cooperative energy transfer process, which not only aroused the NIR CPL but also increased the glum value to 10&#8210;2. Temporal control of these chiral assemblies was realized by introducing alkaline phosphatase to fabricate a biomimetic enzyme&#8210;catalyzed network, allowing the dynamic NIR CPL signal to be turned on. Based on these enzyme&#8208;regulated temporally controllable dynamic CPL&#8208;active chiral assemblies, a multilevel information encryption system was further developed. Our work provides a pioneering example for constructing dynamic NIR CPL materials holding the ability to perform temporal control via the supramolecular assembly strategy, which is expected to aid in the design of supramolecular complex systems that more closely resemble natural biological systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing Dual&#8208;Site Catalysts for Selectively Converting CO2 into Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The variability of CO2 hydrogenation reaction demands new potential strategies to regulate the fine structure of the catalysts for optimizing the reaction pathways. Herein, we report a dual&#8208;site strategy to boost the catalytic efficiency of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methanol (MA) conversion. A new descriptor, &#964;, was initially established for screening the promising candidates with low&#8208;temperature activation capability of CO2, and sequentially a high&#8208;performance catalyst was fabricated centred with oxophilic Mo single atoms, who was further decorated with Pt nanoparticles. In CO2 hydrogenation, the obtained dual&#8208;site catalysts possess a remarkably&#8208;improved MA generation rate (0.27 mmol gcat.&#8208;1 h&#8208;1). For comparison, the singe&#8208;site Mo and Pt&#8208;based catalysts can only produce ethanol (EA) and formate acid (FA) at a relatively low reaction rate (0.11 mmol gcat.&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 for EA and 0.034 mmol gcat.&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 for FA), respectively. Mechanism studies indicate that the introduction of Pt species could create an active hydrogen&#8208;rich environment, leading to the alterations of the adsorption configuration and conversion pathways of the *OCH2 intermediates on Mo sites. As a result, the catalytic selectivity was successfully switched.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Super&#8208;Assembly of Vacancy Engineered Ultrathin&#8208;Nanosheets toward Nanochannels for Smart Ion Transport and Salinity Gradient Power Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ion&#8208;selective nanochannel membranes assembled from two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanosheets hold immense promise for power conversion using salinity gradient. However, they face challenges stemming from insufficient surface charge density, which impairs both permselectivity and durability. Herein, we present a novel vacancy&#8208;engineered, oxygen&#8208;deficient NiCo layered double hydroxide (NiCoLDH)/cellulose nanofibers&#8208;wrapped carbon nanotubes (VOLDH/CNF&#8208;CNT) composite membrane. This membrane, featuring abundant angstrom&#8208;scale, cation&#8208;selective nanochannels, is designed and fabricated through a synergistic combination of vacancy engineering and interfacial super&#8208;assembly. The membrane shows interlayer free&#8208;spacing of ~3.62 &#197;, which validates the membrane size exclusion selectivity.This strategy, validated by DFT calculations and experimental data, improves hydrophilicity and surface charge density, leading to the strong interaction with K+ ions to benefit the low ion transport resistance and exceptional charge selectivity. When employed in an artificial river water|seawater salinity gradient power generator, it delivers a high&#8208;power density of 5.35 W/m2 with long&#8208;term durability (20,000s), which is almost 400% higher than that of the pristine NiCoLDH membrane. Furthermore, it displays both pH&#8208; and temperature&#8208;sensitive ion transport behavior, offering additional opportunities for optimization. This work establishes a basis for high&#8208;performance salinity gradient power conversion and underscores the potential of vacancy engineering and super&#8208;assembly in customizing 2D nanomaterials for diverse advanced nanofluidic energy devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Acidic Electrosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide at Industrial&#8208;Level Current Densities Promoted by Alkali Metal Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acidic H2O2 synthesis through electrocatalytic 2e&#8211; oxygen reduction presents a sustainable alternative to the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone oxidation technology. Nevertheless, acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis suffers from low H2O2 Faradaic efficiencies primarily due to the competing reactions of 4e&#8211; oxygen reduction to H2O and hydrogen evolution in environments with high H+ concentrations. Here, we demonstrate the significant effect of alkali metal cations, acting as competing ions with H+, in promoting acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis at industrial&#8208;level currents, resulting in an effective current densities of 50&#8210;421 mA cm&#8210;2 with 84&#8210;100% Faradaic efficiency and a production rate of 856&#8210;7842 &#956;mol cm&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 that far exceeds the performance observed in pure acidic electrolytes or low&#8208;current electrolysis. Finite&#8208;element simulations indicate that high interfacial pH near the electrode surface formed at high currents is crucial for activating the promotional effect of K+. In situ attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal the central role of alkali metal cations in stabilizing the key *OOH intermediate to suppress 4e&#8211; oxygen reduction through interacting with coordinated H2O.</dc:description>

         <title>Reverse Separation of Carbon Dioxide and Acetylene in Two Isostructural Copper Pyridine&#8208;Carboxylate Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Separating acetylene from carbon dioxide is important but highly challenging due to their similar molecular shapes and physical properties. Adsorptive separation of carbon dioxide from acetylene can directly produce pure acetylene but is hardly realized because of relatively polarizable acetylene binds more strongly. Here, we reverse the CO2 and C2H2 separation by adjusting the pore structures in two isoreticular ultramicroporous metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs). Under ambient conditions, copper isonicotinate (Cu(ina)2), with relatively large pore channels shows C2H2&#8208;selective adsorption with a C2H2/CO2 selectivity of 3.4, whereas&#160;its smaller&#8208;pore analogue,&#160;copper quinoline&#8208;5&#8208;carboxylate (Cu(Qc)2) shows an inverse CO2/C2H2 selectivity of 5.6. Cu(Qc)2 shows compact pore space that well matches the optimal orientation of CO2 but is not compatible for C2H2. Neutron powder diffraction experiments confirmed that CO2 molecules adopt preferential orientation along the pore channels during adsorption binding, whereas C2H2 molecules bind in an opposite fashion with distorted configurations due to their opposite quadrupole moments. Dynamic breakthrough experiments have validated the separation performance of Cu(Qc)2 for CO2/C2H2 separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling Dynamic Structure and Bond Evolutions in BiOIO3 Photocatalysts during CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have established a correlation between photocatalytic activity and dynamic structure/bond evolutions of BiOIO3&#8208;based photocatalysts during CO2 reduction by combining operando X&#8208;ray diffraction with photoelectron spectroscopy. More specifically, the selective photo&#8208;deposition of PtOx species on BiOIO3 (010) facets could effectively promote the electron enrichment on Bi active sites of (100) facets for facilitating the adsorption/activation of CO2 molecules, leading to the formation of Bi sites with high oxidation state and the shrink of crystalline structures. With introducing light irradiation to drive CO2 reduction, the Bi active sites with high oxidation states transformed into normal Bi3+ state, accompanying with the expansion of crystalline structures. Owing to the dynamic structure, bond, and chemical&#8208;state evolutions, a significant improvement of photocatalytic activity for CO evolution has been achieved on PtOx&#8208;BiOIO3 (195.0 &#956;mol g&#8208;1&#8226;h&#8208;1), much higher than the pristine (61.9 &#956;mol g&#8208;1&#8226;h&#8208;1) as well as metal&#8208;Pt decorated BiOIO3 (70.3 &#956;mol g&#8208;1&#8226;h&#8208;1) samples. This work provides new insights to correlate the intrinsically dynamic structure/bond evolutions with CO2 reduction activity, which may help to guide future photocatalyst design.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Ti&#8208;incorporated Zeolite Topology and Pore Condensation on Vapor Phase Propylene Epoxidation Kinetics with Gaseous H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vapor&#8208;phase propylene (C3H6) epoxidation kinetics with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) strongly reflects the physical properties of Ti&#8208;incorporated zeolite catalysts and the presence of spectating molecules (&#8220;solvent&#8221;) near active sites even without a bulk liquid phase. Steady&#8208;state turnover rates of C3H6 epoxidation and product selectivities vary by orders of magnitudes, depending on the zeolite silanol ((SiOH)x) density, pore topology (MFI, *BEA, FAU), and the quantity of condensed acetonitrile (CH3CN) molecules nearby active sites, under identical reaction mechanisms sharing activated H2O2 intermediates on Ti surfaces. Individual kinetic analyses for propylene oxide (PO) ring&#8208;opening, homogeneous diol oxidative cleavage, and homogeneous aldehyde oxidation reveal that secondary reaction kinetics following C3H6 epoxidation responds more sensitively to the changes in zeolite physical properties and pore condensation with CH3CN. Thus, higher PO selectivities achieved in hydrophilic Ti&#8208;MFI at steady&#8208;state reflect the preferential stabilization of transition states for C3H6 epoxidation (a primary reaction) relative to PO ring&#8208;opening and oxidative cleavage (secondary reactions) that solvation effects that reflect interactions among condensed CH3CN within pores and the extended pore structure.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative Oxygenation of Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report an iron&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8211;O bond&#8208;forming reaction under mild, base&#8208;free conditions with visible light irradiation. The transformation uses readily available and structurally diverse carboxylic acids, iron photocatalyst, and 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine 1&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO) derivatives as oxygenation reagents. The process exhibits a broad scope in acids possessing a wide range of stereoelectronic properties and functional groups. The developed reaction was applied to late&#8208;stage oxygenation of a series of bio&#8208;active molecules. The reaction leverages the ability of iron complexes to generate carbon&#8208;centered radicals directly from carboxylic acids by photoinduced carboxylate&#8208;to&#8208;iron charge transfer. Kinetic, electrochemical, EPR, UV&#8208;Vis, HRMS and DFT studies revealed that TEMPO has a triple role in the reaction: as an oxygenation reagent, an oxidant to turn over the Fe&#8208;catalyst, and an internal base for the carboxylic acid deprotonation. The obtained TEMPO adducts represent versatile synthetic intermediates that were further engaged in C&#8211;C and C&#8211;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions using commercial organo&#8208;photocatalysts and nucleophilic reagents</dc:description>

         <title>Optimizing Molecular Packing via Steric Hindrance for Reducing Non&#8208;Radiative Recombination in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Innovative molecule design strategy holds promise for the development of next&#8208;generation acceptor materials for efficient organic solar cells with low non&#8208;radiative energy loss (&#916;Enr). In this study, we designed and prepared three novel acceptors, namely BTP&#8208;Biso, BTP&#8208;Bme and BTP&#8208;B, with sterically structured triisopropylbenzene, trimethylbenzene and benzene as side chains inserted into the shoulder of the central core. The progressively enlarged steric hindrance from BTP&#8208;B to BTP&#8208;Bme and BTP&#8208;Biso induces suppressed intramolecular rotation and altered the molecule packing mode in their aggregation states, leading to significant changes in absorption spectra and energy levels. By regulating the intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, BTP&#8208;Bme possesses relatively reduced non&#8208;radiative recombination rate and extended exciton diffusion lengths. The binary device based on PB2:BTP&#8208;Bme exhibits an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.5% with a low &#916;Enr of 0.19 eV. Furthermore, the ternary device comprising PB2:PBDB&#8208;TF:BTP&#8208;Bme achieves an outstanding PCE of 19.3%. The molecule design strategy in this study proposed new perspectives for developing high&#8208;performance acceptors with low &#916;Enr in OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Dumbbell&#8208;Shaped, Block&#8208;Graft Copolymer with Aligned Domains for High&#8208;performance Hydrocarbon Polymer Electrolyte Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given the environmental concerns surrounding fluoromaterials, the use of high&#8208;cost perfluorinated sulfonic acids (PFSAs) in fuel cells and water electrolysis contradicts the pursuit of clean energy systems. Herein, we present a fluorine&#8208;free dumbbell&#8208;shaped block&#8208;graft copolymer, derived from the cost&#8208;effective triblock copolymer poly(styrene&#8208;b&#8208;ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;butylene&#8208;b&#8208;styrene) (SEBS), for polymer electrolyte membranes (PEMs). This unique polymer shape led to the alignment of the hydrophobic&#8208;hydrophilic domains along a preferred orientation, resulting in the construction of interconnected proton channels across the membrane. A bicontinuous network allowed efficient proton transport with reduced tortuosity, leading to an exceptional ionic conductivity (249 mS cm&#8208;1 at 80 &#176;C and 90% relative humidity (RH)), despite a low ion exchange capacity (IEC; 1.41). Furthermore, membrane&#8208;electrode assembly (MEA) prepared with our membrane exhibited stable performance over a period of 150 h at 80 &#176;C and 30% RH. This study demonstrates a novel polymer structure design and highlights a promising outlook for hydrocarbon PEMs as alternatives to PFSAs.</dc:description>

         <title>Switching between the [2&#960;+2&#963;] and Hetero&#8208;[4&#960;+2&#963;] Cycloaddition Reactivity of Bicyclobutanes with Lewis Acid Catalysts Enables the Synthesis of Spirocycles and Bridged Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exploration of the complex chemical diversity of bicyclo[n.1.1]alkanes and their use as benzene bioisosteres has garnered significant attention over the past two decades. Regiodivergent syntheses of thiabicyclo[4.1.1]octanes (S&#8208;BCOs) and highly substituted bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (BCHs) using a Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed formal cycloaddition of bicyclobutanes (BCBs) and 3&#8208;benzylideneindoline&#8208;2&#8208;thione derivatives have been established. The first hetero&#8208;(4+3) cycloaddition of BCBs, catalyzed by Zn(OTf)2, was achieved with a broad substrate scope under mild conditions. In contrast, the less electrophilic BCB ester undergoes a Sc(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed [2&#960;+2&#963;] reaction with 1,1,2&#8208;trisubstituted alkenes, yielding BCHs with a spirocyclic quaternary carbon center. Control experiments and preliminary theoretical calculations suggest that the diastereoselective [2&#960;+2&#963;] product formation may involve a concerted cycloaddition between a zwitterionic intermediate and E&#8208;1,1,2&#8208;trisubstituted alkenes. Additionally, the hetero&#8208;(4+3) cycloaddition may involve a concerted nucleophilic ring&#8208;opening mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Designed Additive to Regulated Crystallization for High Performance Perovskite Solar Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is a crucial role for enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to prepare high&#8208;quality perovskite films, which can be achieved by delaying the crystallization of perovskite film. Hence, we designed difluoroacetic anhydride (DFA) as an additive to regulating crystallization process thus reducing defect formation during perovskite film formation. It was found DFA reacts with DMSO by forming two molecules, difluoroacetate thioether ester (DTE) and difluoroacetic acid (DA). The strong bonding DTE&#183;PbI2 and DA&#183;PbI2 retard perovskite crystallization process for high&#8208;quality film formation, which was monitored through in situ UV&#8208;vis and PL tests. By using DFA additives, we prepared perovskite films with high&#8208;quality and low defects. Finally, a champion PCE of 25.28% was achieved with excellent environmental stability, which retained 95.75% of the initial PCE after 1152 h at 25 &#176;C under 25% RH.</dc:description>

         <title>Bias&#8208;switchable Dual&#8208;Mode Organic Photodetector with High Operational Stability Using Self&#8208;trapped Cs3Cu2I5 Interfacial layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional photovoltaic (PV)&#8208;photodetectors are hard to detect fainted signals, while photomultiplication (PM)&#8208;capable devices indispensable for detecting weak light and are prone to degrade under strong light illumination and large bias, and it is urgent to realize highly efficient integrated detecting system with both PM and PV operation modes. In this work, one lead&#8208;free Cs3Cu2I5 nanocrystals with self&#8208;trapping exciton nature was introduced as interfacial layer adjacent to bulk and layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer heterojunction structure, and corresponding organic photodetectors with bias&#8208;switchable dual modes are demonstrated. The fabricated device exhibits low operating bias (0 V for PV mode and 0.8 V for PM mode), high specific detectivity (~1013 Jones), fast response speed as low as 1.59 &#181;s, large bandwidth over 0.2&#160;MHz and long&#8208;term operational stability last for 4 months in ambient condition. This synergy strategy also validated in different materials and device architectures, providing a convenient and scalable production process to develop highly efficient bias&#8208;switchable multi&#8208;functional organic optoelectrical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Leveraging Electron Push&#8208;Pull Effect for Catalytic Polymerization and Degradation of a Cyclobutane Monomer System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) offers a striking solution to solve problems encountered in step&#8208;growth condensation polymerization, including precise control over molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, and topology. This has inspired our interest in ROP of cycloalkanes with an ultimate goal to rethink polyolefins, which clearly poses a number of challenges. Practicality of ROP of cycloalkanes is actually limited by their low polymerizability and elusive mechanisms which arise from significantly varied ring size and non&#8208;polar C&#8211;C bonds in monomers. In this work, by using Lewis acid/Br&#248;nsted base/C(sp3)&#8211;H initiator system previously developed in our laboratory, we focus on cyclobutanes and explore the positional and electronic effects of substituents on the ring, namely electron push&#8208;pull effect, in promoting controlled polymerization to afford densely functionalized poly(cyclobutanes), as well as catalytic degradation of obtained polymers for upcycling. More importantly, experiments and DFT calculations unveil considerable population of Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;induced thermostabilized 1,4&#8208;zwitterions, which distinguish cyclobutanes from cyclopropanes and others. All these findings would shed light on catalytic synthesis and degradation of saturated all&#8208;carbon main&#8208;chain polymers, as well as small molecule transformations of cyclobutanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Bridging Nickel&#8208;MOF and Copper Single Atoms/Clusters with H&#8208;Substituted Graphdiyne for the Tandem Catalysis of Nitrate to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interfacial engineering of synergistic catalysts is one of the keys to achieving multiple proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer processes in nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion. Herein, by joining ultrathin nickel&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (denoted Ni&#8208;MOF) nanosheets with few&#8208;layered hydrogen&#8208;substituted graphdiyne&#8208;supported copper single atoms and clusters (denoted HsGDY@Cu), a tandem catalyst of Ni&#8208;MOFs@HsGDY@Cu with dual&#8208;active interfaces was developed for the concerted catalysis of nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia. In such a system, the sandwiched HsGDY layer could serve as a bridge to connect the coordinated unsaturated Ni2+ sites with Cu single atoms/clusters in a limited range of 0 to 3.6 nm. From Ni2+ to Cu, via the hydrogen spillover process, the hydrogen radicals (H&#183;) generated at the unsaturated Ni2+ sites could migrate across HsGDY to the Cu sites to participate in the transformation of *HNO3 to NH3. From Cu to Ni2+, bypassing the higher reaction energy for *HNO3 formation on the Ni2+ sites, the NO2&#8722; detached from the Cu sites could diffuse onto the unsaturated Ni2+ sites to form NH3 as well. The combined results make this hybrid a tandem catalyst with dual active sites for the catalysis of nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion with improved Faradaic efficiency at lower overpotentials.</dc:description>

         <title>Carboxylesterase Activatable Molecular Probe for Personalized Treatment Guidance by Analyte&#8208;Induced Molecular Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accurate visualization of tumor microenvironment is of great significance for personalized medicine. Here, we develop a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence/photoacoustic (FL/PA) dual&#8208;mode molecular probe (denoted as NIR&#8208;CE) for distinguishing tumors based on carboxylesterase (CE) level by an analyte&#8208;induced molecular transformation (AIMT) strategy. The recognition moiety for CE activity is the acetyl unit of NIR&#8208;CE, generating the pre&#8208;product, NIR&#8208;CE&#8208;OH, which undergoes spontaneous hydrogen atom exchange between the nitrogen atoms in the indole group and the phenol hydroxyl group, eventually transforming into NIR&#8208;CE&#8208;H. In cellular experiments and in vivo blind studies, the human hepatoma cells and tumors with high level of CE were successfully distinguished by both NIR FL and PA imaging. Our findings provide a new molecular imaging strategy for personalized treatment guidance.</dc:description>

         <title>Indium Tin Oxide Induced Internal Positive Feedback and Indium Ion Transport in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stability is the most pressing challenge hindering the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), and previous efforts focused more on enhancing the resistance of PSCs to external stimulus. Here, we found that the indium tin oxide (ITO) will deteriorate the photovoltaic performance of PSCs through positive feedback cycles. Specifically, the perovskite degradation products will cross the electron transport layer &#160;to chemically etch the electrode ITO to generate In3+, which will migrate upwards into the perovskite film. Then, the reaction that corrodes ITO consumes the decomposition products of perovskite and shifts the balance of the perovskite decomposition reaction, further promoting the degradation and thus falling into a positive feedback cycle. Moreover, the In3+ in the perovskite film was found to accumulate at the upper surface, which would lead to n&#8208;type doping of perovskite film to form the energy barrier for interface carrier extraction. Subsequently, the chelating molecule ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA&#8208;2Na) was introduced onto ITO to firmly chelate the In3+ and prevent it from migrating upward, thus breaking this internal positive feedback cycle and significantly enhancing the efficiency and stability of PSCs. This work provides new perspectives for understanding the mechanism of photovoltaic performance loss and ionic transport in PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Multidimensional Electrochemistry Decodes the Operando Mechanism of Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining DC voltammetry and AC impedance spectroscopy, the operando mechanism of the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) conducted on a gas&#8208;diffusion electrode was decoded through data co&#8208;fitting. The reaction rates of three elementary steps (Tafel, Heyrovsky, and Volmer) over a practical potential range were thus distilled individually, revealing that the Volmer step had never been a rate determining step as presumed in previous reports.







Abstract
Being an efficient approach to the utilization of hydrogen energy, the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is of particular significance in the current carbon&#8208;neutrality time. Yet the mechanistic picture of the HOR is still blurred, mostly because the elemental steps of this reaction are rapid and highly entangled, especially when deviating from the thermodynamic equilibrium state. Here we report a strategy for decoding the HOR mechanism under operando conditions. In addition to the wide&#8208;potential&#8208;range I&#8211;V curves obtained using gas diffusion electrodes, we have applied the AC impedance spectroscopy to provide independent and complementary kinetic information. Combining multidimensional data sources has enabled us to fit, in mathematical rigor, the core kinetic parameter set in a 5&#8208;D data space. The reaction rate of the three elemental steps (Tafel, Heyrovsky, and Volmer reactions), as a function of the overpotential, can thus be distilled individually. Such an undocumented kinetic picture unravels, in detail, how the HOR is controlled by the elemental steps on polarization. For instance, at low polarization region, the Heyrovsky reaction is relatively slow and can be ignored; but at high polarization region, the Heyrovsky reaction will surpass the Tafel reaction. Additionally, the Volmer reaction has been the fastest within overpotentials of interest. Our findings not only offer a better understanding of the HOR mechanism, but also lay the foundation for the development of improved hydrogen energy utilization systems.

         <title>Cross&#8208;selective Deoxygenative Coupling of Aliphatic Alcohols: Installation of Methyl Groups including Isotopic Labels by Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling reaction provides, for the first time, a cross&#8208;selective reaction of two alcohols. Methanol, activated as methyl tosylate, undergoes XEC with a range of secondary alcohols activated as the corresponding mesylates. Catalyst turnover is achieved with a stoichiometric reducing metal or electrochemically. This transformation provides facile incorporation of isotopic labels, by deuteration of ketone intermediates and/or employing isotopically labelled methanol.







Abstract
Nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling reactions of two aliphatic alcohol derivatives remain a challenge. Herein, we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive methylation reaction of aliphatic mesylates with methyl tosylate. This reaction provides straightforward access to compounds bearing aliphatic methyl groups from alkyl alcohol derivatives. Isotopically labelled substrates and reagents can be employed in the reaction to provide perdeuterated and 13C&#8208;labelled products. This transformation can be achieved by employing stoichiometric Mn reductant or electrochemically. Additionally, mechanistic experiments show that alkyl iodides are key intermediates in the transformation which undergo a stereoablative reaction via radical intermediates.

         <title>In Situ Formation of Platinum&#8208;Carbon Catalysts in Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Propane dehydrogenation over Pt nanoparticles is an essential industrial reaction to produce propylene. However, the structures that form under reaction conditions have remained elusive. Using operando transmission electron microscopy (OTEM) we found that in situ generated ordered Pt&#8722;C solid solutions are responsible for heightened selectivity. Its impact on propane dehydrogenation is discussed.







Abstract
The catalytic production of propylene via propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a key reaction in the chemical industry. By combining operando transmission electron microscopy with density functional theory analysis, we show that the intercalation and ordering of carbon on Pt interstitials to form Pt&#8722;C solid solutions is relevant for increasing propylene production. More specifically, we found that at the point of enhanced propylene formation, the structure of platinum nanoparticles is transformed into a transient caesium chloride&#8208;type Pt&#8722;C polymorph. At more elevated temperatures, the zincblende and rock salt polymorphs seemingly coexist. When propylene production was highest, multiple crystal structures consisting of Pt and carbon were occasionally found to coexist in one individual nanoparticle, distorting the Pt lattice. Catalyst coking was detected at all stages of the reaction, but did initially not affect all particles. These findings could lead to the development of novel synthesis strategies towards tailoring highly efficient PDH catalysts.

         <title>Achieving Near&#8208;Unity Red Light Photoluminescence in Antimony Halide Crystals via Polyhedron Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three (TMS)2SbCl5 crystals have been prepared with diverse [SbCl5]2&#8722; configurations and distinct emission color (i.e., red, orange, and yellow) through solvent engineering. It is found that higher coordination symmetry and longer Sb&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Sb distance are in favor of the larger Stokes shift and lower energy emission. This work sheds insights into the structure&#8208;photoluminescence relationship towards development of highly efficient optoelectronic materials.







Abstract
Exploration of efficient red emitting antimony hybrid halide with large Stokes shift and zero self&#8208;absorption is highly desirable due to its enormous potential for applications in solid light emitting, and active optical waveguides. However, it is still challenging and rarely reported. Herein, a series of (TMS)2SbCl5 (TMS=triphenylsulfonium cation) crystals have been prepared with diverse [SbCl5]2&#8722; configurations and distinctive emission color. Among them, cubic&#8208;phase (TMS)2SbCl5 shows bright red emission with a large Stokes shift of 312&#8197;nm. In contrast, monoclinic and orthorhombic (TMS)2SbCl5 crystals deliver efficient yellow and orange emission, respectively. Comprehensive structural investigations reveal that larger Stokes shift and longer&#8208;wavelength emission of cubic (TMS)2SbCl5 can be attributed to the larger lattice volume and longer Sb&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Sb distance, which favor sufficient structural aberration freedom at excited states. Together with robust stability, (TMS)2SbCl5 crystal family has been applied as optical waveguide with ultralow loss coefficient of 3.67&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;4&#8197;dB&#8201;&#956;m&#8722;1, and shows superior performance in white&#8208;light emission and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. In short, our study provides a novel and fundamental perspective to structure&#8208;property&#8208;application relationship of antimony hybrid halides, which will contribute to future rational design of high&#8208;performance emissive metal halides.

         <title>Water&#8208;Ice Microstructures and Hydration States of Acridinium Iodide Studied by Phosphorescence Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphorescence spectroscopy was utilized to visualize the microstructure transition of water at varying temperatures from 298&#8197;K to 77&#8197;K at a probe concentration of ~10&#8722;5&#8197;M, showing higher sensitivity by at least two orders of magnitude than absorption&#8208;base techniques. By this unique means, it was found that a trace amount (as low as 10&#8722;5&#8197;M) of organic hydrophiles could thoroughly prevent the crystallization of water ice at freezing temperatures.







Abstract
Ice has been suggested to have played a significant role in the origin of life partly owing to its ability to concentrate organic molecules and promote reaction efficiency. However, the techniques for studying organic molecules in ice are absorption&#8208;based, which limits the sensitivity of measurements. Here we introduce an emission&#8208;based method to study organic molecules in water ice: the phosphorescence displays high sensitivity depending on the hydration state of an organic salt probe, acridinium iodide (ADI). The designed ADI aqueous system exhibits phosphorescence that can be severely perturbed when the temperature is higher than 110&#8197;K at a concentration of the order of 10&#8722;5&#8197;M, indicating changes in hydration for ADI. Using the ADI phosphorescent probe, it is found that the microstructures of water ice, i.e., crystalline vs. glassy, can be strongly dictated by a trace amount (as low as 10&#8722;5&#8197;M) of water&#8208;soluble organic molecules. Consistent with cryoSEM images and temperature&#8208;dependent Raman spectral data, the ADI is dehydrated in more crystalline ice and hydrated in more glassy ice. The current investigation serves as a starting point for using more sensitive spectroscopic techniques for studying water&#8208;organics interactions at a much lower concentration and wider temperature range.

         <title>Perfluorooxosulfate Salts as SOF4&#8208;Gas&#8208;Free Precursors to Multidimensional SuFEx Electrophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfurimidoyl difluorides (RNSOF2) are excellent multidimensional SuFEx hubs, however their preparation from the scarcely available thionyl tetrafluoride (SOF4) gas limits this chemistry. Here, we propose silver pentafluorooxosulfate (AgOSF5) as a viable alternative to SOF4. Prepared by the AgF2&#8208;mediated oxidation of SOCl2, we found that the adduct produces sulfurimidoyl fluorides in high yields from primary amines, also extendable to AgOSF4CF3.







Abstract
Sulfur(VI) Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx) chemistry stands as a well&#8208;established method for swiftly constructing complex molecules in a modular fashion. An especially promising segment of this toolbox is reserved for multidimensional SuFEx hubs: three or more substituents pluggable into a singular SVI centre to make &#8216;beyond&#8208;linear&#8217; clicked constructions. Sulfurimidoyl difluorides (RNSOF2) stand out as the prime example of this, however their preparation from the scarcely available thionyl tetrafluoride (SOF4) limits this chemistry to only a few laboratories with access to this gas. In this work, we identify silver pentafluorooxosulfate (AgOSF5) as a viable SuFEx hub with reactivity equal to SOF4. The AgF2&#8208;mediated oxidation of SOCl2 gives rise to the hexacoordinate AgOSF5 adduct, which in contact with primary amines produces the sulfurimidoyl fluorides in high yields. In addition, we have found this workflow to be fully extendable to the trifluoromethyl homologue, AgOSF4CF3, and we propose the use of AgOSF4X salts as a general route to azasulfur SuFEx electrophiles from commercial starting materials.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of SCF3&#8208;Substituted Alkylboronates by Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroboration of 1&#8208;Trifluoromethylthioalkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and enantioselective hydroboration of 1&#8208;trifluoromethylthio(SCF3)&#8208;alkenes with H&#8208;Bpin has been developed. The enantioselective hydrocupration and subsequent boration reaction generate a chiral SCF3&#8208;containing alkylboronate, of which Bpin moiety can be further transformed to deliver various optically active SCF3 molecules. Computational studies suggest that SCF3 group successfully controls the regioselectivity.

The enantioselective hydrocupration of an in situ generated CuH species and subsequent boration reaction generate a chiral SCF3&#8208;containing alkylboronate, of which Bpin moiety can be further transformed to deliver various optically active SCF3 molecules. Computational studies suggest that the SCF3 group successfully controls the regioselectivity in the reaction.

         <title>Selective Defluorination of Trifluoromethyl Substituents by Conformationally Induced Remote Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amide derivatives of trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted benzaldehydes, and their heterocyclic congeners, may be selectively cyclodefluorinated by a remote substitution reaction under mild conditions, giving difluoromethyl&#8208;substituted aldehydes after hydrolysis. Selective single and double defluorinations are possible using this method, which provides a versatile route to difluoromethyl arenes.







Abstract
The selective reduction of an aromatic trifluoromethyl substituent to a difluoromethyl substituent may be achieved by base&#8208;promoted elimination to form a difluoro&#8208;p&#8208;quinomethide which is trapped by an intramolecular nucleophile. High yields are obtained when the nucleophilic trap entails the conformationally favoured cyclisation of an aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) derivative. The resulting cyclised difluoromethyl&#8208;substituted arylimidazolidinone products are readily converted to versatile difluoromethyl&#8208;substituted aldehydes by reduction and hydrolysis. Defluorination is successful on a range of benzenoid (both para and ortho CF3&#8208;substituted) and heterocyclic substrates. Double defluorination may likewise be achieved sequentially, or in a single step, from an Aib dipeptide derivative.

         <title>Regulating the Topology of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting Overall H2O2 Photogeneration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By linking site design, two novel two dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with similar chemical constitutions but different topologies were constructed. TBD&#8208;COF with six&#8208;arm cores and cpt topology exhibited better H2O2 photosynthetic activity than TBC&#8208;COF with three&#8208;arm cores and hcb topology through the O2&#8208;O2&#8901;&#8722;&#8208;H2O2, O2&#8208;O2&#8901;&#8722;&#8208;O21&#8208;H2O2, and H2O&#8208;H2O2 three channels, inspiring regulating the topology of COFs for boosting overall H2O2 photogeneration.







Abstract
Photocatalytic oxygen reduction reactions and water oxidation reactions are extremely promising green approaches for massive H2O2 production. Nonetheless, constructing effective photocatalysts for H2O2 generation is critical and still challenging. Since the network topology has significant impacts on the electronic properties of two dimensional (2D) polymers, herein, for the first time, we regulated the H2O2 photosynthetic activity of 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) by topology. Through designing the linking sites of the monomers, we synthesized a pair of novel COFs with similar chemical components on the backbones but distinct topologies. Without sacrificial agents, TBD&#8208;COF with cpt topology exhibited superior H2O2 photoproduction performance (6085 and 5448&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in O2 and air) than TBC&#8208;COF with hcb topology through the O2&#8208;O2&#8901;&#8722;&#8208;H2O2, O2&#8208;O2&#8901;&#8722;&#8208;O21&#8208;H2O2, and H2O&#8208;H2O2 three paths. Further experimental and theoretical investigations confirmed that during the H2O2 photosynthetic process, the charge carrier separation efficiency, O2&#8901;&#8722; generation and conversion, and the energy barrier of the rate determination steps in the three channels, related to the formation of *OOH, *O21, and *OH, can be well tuned by the topology of COFs. The current study enlightens the fabrication of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts for H2O2 production by topological structure modulation.

         <dc:description>
We report a novel chemoselective dehydrogenative functionalization of cyclopropylamides enabled by cooperative photoredox and cobalt catalysis for forging the allylic N,O&#8208;acyl&#8208;acetal scaffolds in an environmental&#8208;friendly and atom&#8208;economic fashion. The starting materials were readily available and the transformation proceeded under extremely mild conditions with good functional group tolerance and broad scopes.







Abstract
We disclose herein a novel photoredox and cobalt co&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening/acceptorless dehydrogenative functionalization of mono&#8208;donor cyclopropanes. This sustainable and atom&#8208;economic approach allows the rapid assembly of a wide range of allylic N,O&#8208;acyl&#8208;acetal derivatives. The starting materials are readily available and the reaction features mild conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent functional group compatibility. The optimized conditions accommodate assorted cycloalkylamides and primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols, with applications in late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceutically relevant compounds, stimulating further utility in medicinal chemistry. Moreover, selective nucleophilic substitutions with various carbon nucleophiles were achieved in a one&#8208;pot fashion, offering a reliable avenue to access some cyclic and acyclic derivatives.

         <title>Unlocking the Metalation Applications of TMP&#8208;powered Fe and Co(II) bis(amides): Synthesis, Structure and Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversing the more usual trend of replicating transition metal chemistry with main group compounds, this work elaborates the applications of the new earth&#8208;abundant d&#8208;block amides Fe(TMP)2 and Co(TMP)2 in deprotonative metalation chemistry, a field dominated by highly polar s&#8208;block amides such as LiTMP and NaTMP (TMP=2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide).







Abstract
Typified by LiTMP and TMPMgCl.LiCl, (TMP=2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide), s&#8208;block metal amides have found widespread applications in arene deprotonative metalation. On the contrary, transition metal amides lack sufficient basicity to activate these substrates. Breaking new ground in this field, here we present the synthesis and full characterisation of earth&#8208;abundant transition metals M(TMP)2 (M=Fe, Co). Uncovering a new reactivity profile towards fluoroarenes, these amide complexes can promote direct M&#8722;H exchange processes regioselectively using one or two of their basic amide arms. Remarkably, even when using a perfluorinated substrate, selective C&#8208;H metalation occurs leaving C&#8722;F bonds intact. Their kinetic basicity can be boosted by LiCl or NBu4Cl additives which enables formation of kinetically activated ate species. Combining spectroscopic and structural studies with DFT calculations, mechanistic insights have been gained on how these low polarity metalation processes take place. M(TMP)2 can also be used to access ferrocene and cobaltocene by direct deprotonation of cyclopentadiene and undergo efficient CO2 insertion of both amide groups under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Responsive Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Molecular Networks Capable of Retaining Crystalline Periodicity after Isomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochromic hydrogen&#8208;bonded network that retains crystalline periodicity after photo&#8208;isomerization was constructed using a tetracarboxylic acid derivative with a dihydrodimethylbenzo[e]pyrene core.







Abstract
The molecular conformation, crystalline morphology, and properties of photochromic organic crystals can be controlled through photoirradiation, making them promising candidates for functional organic materials. However, photochromic porous molecular crystals with a networked framework structure are rare due to the difficulty in maintaining space that allows for photo&#8208;induced molecular motion in the crystalline state. This study describes a photo&#8208;responsive single crystal based on hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) network of dihydrodimethylbenzo[e]pyrene derivative 4BDHP. A crystal composed of H&#8208;bonded undulate layers, 4BDHP&#8208;2, underwent photo&#8208;isomerization in the crystalline state due to loose stacking of the layers. Particularly, enantio&#8208;pure crystal (S,S)&#8208;4BDHP&#8208;2 allowed to reveal the structure of the photoisomerized crystal, in which the closed form (4BDHP) and open form (4CPD) were arranged alternately with keeping crystalline periodicity, although side reactions were also implied. The present proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept system of a photochromic framework that retains crystalline periodicity after photo&#8208;isomerization may provide new light&#8208;driven porous functional materials.

         <title>Disaggregation&#8208;Activated pan&#8208;COX Imaging Agents for Human Soft tissue Sarcoma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
First disaggregation induced pan&#8208;COX imaging agents shed light on cancer stem cells in human sarcoma tissue. Using the pan&#8208;COX targeting indomethacin conjugated BODIPY fluorophore, disaggregation dependent turn&#8208;on chemosensor was designed for parafin&#8208;fixed tissue imaging. Disaggregation schematics are created with BioRender.com







Abstract
Cancer stem cells are pivotal players in tumors initiation, growth, and metastasis. While several markers have been identified, there remain challenges particularly in heterogeneous malignancies like adult soft tissue sarcomas, where conventional markers are inherently overexpressed. Here, we designed BODIPY scaffold fluorescence probes (BD&#8208;IMC&#8208;1, BD&#8208;IMC&#8208;2) that activate via disaggregation targeting for cyclooxygenase (COX), a potential marker for CSCs in sarcoma in clinical pathology. Based on their structures, BD&#8208;IMC&#8208;1 showcased higher susceptibility to disaggregation compared to BD&#8208;IMC&#8208;2, consistent with their selective interaction with COX. Notably, the BD&#8208;IMC&#8208;1 revealed positive cooperativity binding to COX&#8208;2 at sub&#8208;micromolar ranges. Both probes showed significant fluorescence turn&#8208;on upon LPS or PMA triggered COX&#8208;2 upregulation in live RAW264.7, HeLa, and human sarcoma cell line (Saos&#8208;LM2) up to 2&#8208;fold increase with negligible toxicity. More importantly, the BD&#8208;IMC&#8208;1 demonstrated their practical imaging for COX&#8208;2 positive cells in paraffin&#8208;fixed human sarcoma tissue. Considering the fixed tissues are most practiced pathological sample, our finding suggests a potential of disaggregation activated chemosensor for clinical applications.

         <title>Buffer Chain Model for Understanding Crystallization Competition in Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystallization competition between conjugated backbones and side chains is critical to obtaining modulated microstructures and improved properties of conjugated polymers. A buffer chain model is proposed here to describe the linker between backbone and side chains. Longer buffer chains in a model polymer system could effectively relieve this crystallization competition, resulting in better charge transport performance.







Abstract
It remains challenging to comprehensively understand the packing models of conjugated polymers, in which side chains play extremely critical roles. The side chains are typically flexible and non&#8208;conductive and are widely used to improve the polymer solubility in organic solutions. Herein, a buffer chain model is proposed to describe link between conjugated backbone and side chains for understanding the relationship of crystallization competition of conductive conjugated backbones and non&#8208;conductive side chains. A longer buffer chain is beneficial for alleviating such crystallization competition and further promoting the spontaneous packing of conjugated backbones, resulting in enhanced charge transport properties. Our results provide a novel concept for designing conjugated polymers towards ordered organization and enhanced electronic properties and highlight the importance of balancing the competitive interactions between different parts of conjugated polymers.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction Using Metastable Zirconium Suboxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strategies for discovery of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts are important to advance clean energy technologies. Metastable phases such as low temperature or interfacial structures that are difficult to access in bulk may offer such catalytically active surfaces. We report here that the suboxide Zr3O, which is formed at Zr&#8208;ZrO2 interfaces but does not appear in the experimental Zr&#8208;O phase diagram exhibits outstanding oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance surpassing that of benchmark Pt/C and most transition metal&#8208;based catalysts. Addition of Fe3C nanoparticles to give a Zr&#8208;Zr3O&#8208;Fe3C/NC catalyst (NC = nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon) gives a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.914 V, outperforming Pt/C and showing only a 3 mV decrease after 20,000 electrochemical cycles. A zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB) using this cathode material has a high power density of 241.1 mW cm&#8208;2 and remains stable for over 50 days of continuous cycling, demonstrating potential for practical applications. Zr3O demonstrates that interfacial or other phases that are difficult to stabilize may offer new directions for the discovery of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are two&#8208;dimensional, crystalline porous framework materials with numerous scopes of tunability like porosity, functionality, stability and aspect ratio (thickness to length ratio). The manipulation of &#960;&#8208;stacking in COFs results in truly 2D materials, namely covalent organic nanosheets (CONs) adds advantages in many applications. In this review, we have discussed both top&#8208;down (COFs&#8594;CONs) and bottom&#8208;up (molecules&#8594;CONs) with precise information on thickness and lateral growth. We have showcased the research progress of CONs in few selected applications like batteries, catalysis, sensing and biomedical applications. This review specifically highlights the reports where the authors compare the performance of CONs with COFs by demonstrating the impact of thickness and lateral growth of the nanosheets. Eventually, we have provided the possible scope of exploration of CONs research in terms of inter&#8208;dimensional conversion like graphene to carbon nanotube and future technologies..</dc:description>

         <title>Reviving Cost&#8208;Effective Organic Cathodes in Halide&#8208;Based All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The evolution of inorganic solid electrolytes has revolutionized the field of sustainable organic cathode materials, particularly addressing the dissolution problems in traditional liquid electrolytes. However, current sulfide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;organic batteries still face challenges such as high working temperatures, high costs, and low voltage. Here, we design an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium battery based on a cost&#8208;effective organic cathode material phenanthrenequinone (PQ) and a halide solid electrolyte Li2ZrCl6. Thanks to the good compatibility between PQ and Li2ZrCl6, the PQ cathode achieved a high specific capacity of 248 mAh g&#8208;1 (96% of the theoretical capacity), a high average discharge voltage of 2.74 V (vs. Li+/Li), and a good capacity retention of 95% after 100 cycles at room temperature (25 &#176;C). Furthermore, the interaction between the high&#8208;voltage carbonyl PQ cathode and both sulfide and halide solid electrolytes, as well as the redox mechanism of PQ cathode in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries,&#160; were carefully studied by a variety of advanced characterizations. We believe such a design and the corresponding investigations for the underlying chemistry give insights into the further development of practical all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;organic batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Dearomatization of Pyridinium Salts by Copper&#8208;Catalyzed C4&#8208;Selective Addition of Silicon Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A copper&#8208;catalyzed C4&#8208;selective addition of silicon nucleophiles released from an Si&#8211;B reagent to prochiral pyridinium triflates is reported. The dearomatization proceeds with excellent enantioselectivity using Cu(CH3CN)4PF6 as the precatalyst and (R,R)&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE as the chiral ligand. A carbonyl group at C3 is required, likely acting a weak group to preorganize and direct the nucleophilc attack towards C4. The resulting 4&#8208;silylated 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines can be further converted into functionalized piperidine derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;dependent Reactivity of Heavy Pnictogen Double Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemistry of light dipnictenes has been widely investigated in the last century with remarkable achievements especially for azobenzene derivatives. In contrast, distibenes and dibismuthenes are relatively rare and show very limited reactivity. Herein, we have designed a protocol using visible light to enhance&#160;the reactivity of heavy dipnictenes. Exploiting the distinctive &#960;&#8208;&#960;* transition, we have been able to isolate unique examples of dipnictene&#8208;cobalt complexes. The reactivity of the distibene complex was further exploited using red light in the presence of a diazoolefin to access an unusual four&#8208;membered bicyclo[1.1.0]butane analog, containing only a single carbon atom. These findings set the bases to a conceptually new strategy in heavy element double bonds chemistry where visible light is at the front seat of bond activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct a&#8208;Hydroxy Acid Loading onto a Bacterial Thiotemplate Assembly Line via a Multienzyme Gateway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Various nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) create structural and functional diversity by incorporating a&#8208;hydroxy acids into peptide backbones. Trigonic acid, an unusual cyclopropanol&#8208;substituted hydroxy acid, is the source of the molecular warhead of malleicyprol, a critical virulence factor of human and animal pathogens of the Burkholderia pseudomallei (BP) group. The process of selecting and loading this building block remained enigmatic as the NRPS module designated for this task is noncanonical. Using a combination of bioinformatics, mutational analyses, targeted metabolomics, and in vitro biochemical assays, we show that two trans&#8208;acting enzymes are required to load this central building block onto the modular assembly line. An adenylation&#8208;thiolation didomain enzyme (BurJ) activates trigonic acid, followed by the translocation of the enzyme&#8208;bound &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acid thioester by an FkbH&#8208;like protein with a mutated phosphatase domain (BurH). This specialized gateway is the first reported direct loading of a hydroxy acid onto a bona fide NRPS module in bacteria and expands the synthetic biology toolbox for the site&#8208;specific incorporation of non&#8208;canonical building blocks. Moreover, insight into the biochemical basis of virulence factor biosynthesis can provide a foundation for developing enzyme inhibitors as anti&#8208;virulence therapeutics against BP pathogen infections.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Mechanisms of Hypohalous Acid Formation and Electrophilic Halogenation by Non&#8208;Native Halogenases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrophilic halogenases in nature are typically not efficient. Guided by flavin&#8208;dependent halogenase mechanisms and taking advantage of the versatile reactivity of a flavin hydroperoxide adduct and in situ generation of H2O2 by flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes, it was possible to promote the formation of a hypohalous acid&#8212;which is key for electrophilic halogenation&#8212;in various non&#8208;native halogenases by rerouting the flavin&#8208;generated peroxide.







Abstract
Enzymatic electrophilic halogenation is a mild tool for functionalization of diverse organic compounds. Only a few groups of native halogenases are capable of catalyzing such a reaction. In this study, we used a mechanism&#8208;guided strategy to discover the electrophilic halogenation activity catalyzed by non&#8208;native halogenases. As the ability to form a hypohalous acid (HOX) is key for halogenation, flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenases/oxidases capable of forming C4a&#8208;hydroperoxyflavin (FlC4a&#8208;OOH), such as dehalogenase, hydroxylases, luciferase and pyranose&#8208;2&#8208;oxidase (P2O), and flavin reductase capable of forming H2O2 were explored for their abilities to generate HOX in situ. Transient kinetic analyses using stopped&#8208;flow spectrophotometry/fluorometry and product analysis indicate that FlC4a&#8208;OOH in dehalogenases, selected hydroxylases and luciferases, but not in P2O can form HOX; however, the HOX generated from FlC4a&#8208;OOH cannot halogenate their substrates. Remarkably, in situ H2O2 generated by P2O can form HOI and also iodinate various compounds. Because not all enzymes capable of forming FlC4a&#8208;OOH can react with halides to form HOX, QM/MM calculations, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis and structural analysis were carried out to elucidate the mechanism underlying HOX formation and characterize the active site environment. Our findings shed light on identifying new halogenase scaffolds besides the currently known enzymes and have invoked a new mode of chemoenzymatic halogenation.

         <title>Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly of Multidimensional Functional Materials from Sequence&#8208;Defined Peptoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The correlation between microscopic molecular structures of sequenced&#8208;defined peptoids and their resultant macroscopic assemblies was explored. By incorporating tetraphenylethylene and its derivative as functional groups at the termini of peptoid sequences, three&#8208;dimensional twisted bundles were evolved from discrete nanotubes or nanosheets, further enabling the creation of a highly efficient artificial light harvesting system.







Abstract
Hierarchical self&#8208;assembly represents a powerful strategy for the fabrication of functional materials across various length scales. However, achieving precise formation of functional hierarchical assemblies remains a significant challenge and requires a profound understanding of molecular assembly interactions. In this study, we present a molecular&#8208;level understanding of the hierarchical assembly of sequence&#8208;defined peptoids into multidimensional functional materials, including twisted nanotube bundles serving as a highly efficient artificial light harvesting system. By employing synchrotron&#8208;based powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and analyzing single crystal structures of model compounds, we elucidated the molecular packing and mechanisms underlying the assembly of peptoids into multidimensional nanostructures. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating aromatic functional groups, such as tetraphenyl ethylene (TPE), at the termini of assembling peptoid sequences promotes the formation of twisted bundles of nanotubes and nanosheets, thus enabling the creation of a highly efficient artificial light harvesting system. This research exemplifies the potential of leveraging sequence&#8208;defined synthetic polymers to translate microscopic molecular structures into macroscopic assemblies. It holds promise for the development of functional materials with precisely controlled hierarchical structures and designed functions.

By employing synchrotron-based powder X-ray diffraction and analyzing single crystal structures of model compounds, we elucidated the molecular packing and mechanisms underlying the assembly of peptoids into multidimensional nanostructures. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating aromatic functional groups, such as tetraphenyl ethylene (TPE), at the termini of assembling peptoid sequences promotes the formation of twisted bundles of nanotubes and nanosheets, thus enabling the creation of a highly efficient artificial light harvesting system. This research exemplifies the potential of leveraging sequence-defined synthetic polymers to translate microscopic molecular structures into macroscopic assemblies. It holds promise for the development of functional materials with precisely controlled hierarchical structures and designed functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantiopure Corral[4]BINOLs as Ultrastrong Receptors for Recognition and Differential Sensing of Steroids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of enantiomeric macrocycles, RRRR&#8208; and SSSS&#8208;C[4]BINOL, demonstrated exceptionally high recognition affinities (up to 1012&#8197;M&#8722;1) towards 16 important steroidal compounds in aqueous solutions, establishing them the most effective known steroid receptors. The two C[4]BINOL enantiomers were employed to compose a fluorescent sensor array which achieved discrimination and sensing of 16 structurally similar steroids in biofluids.







Abstract
The precise recognition and sensing of steroids, a type of vital biomolecules, hold immense practical value across various domains. In this study, we introduced corral[4]BINOLs (C[4]BINOLs), a pair of enantiomeric conjugated deep&#8208;cavity hosts, as novel synthetic receptors for binding steroids. Due to the strong hydrophobic effect of their deep nonpolar, chiral cavities, the two enantiomers of C[4]BINOLs demonstrated exceptionally high recognition affinities (up to 1012&#8197;M&#8722;1) for 16 important steroidal compounds as well as good enantioselectiviy (up to 15.5) in aqueous solutions, establishing them as the most potent known steroid receptors. Harnessing their ultrahigh affinity, remarkable enantioselectivity, and fluorescence emission properties, the two C[4]BINOL enantiomers were employed to compose a fluorescent sensor array which achieved discrimination and sensing of 16 structurally similar steroids at low concentrations.

         <title>The CF3 Group as a Synthon of the CF+ Unit in Palladium Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pulling fluorine off: The unusually high activity of the C&#8722;F bond found in the homoleptic trifluoromethyl&#8208;palladium(II) complex [Pd(CF3)4]2&#8722; is correlated to the very low fluoride&#8208;ion affinity of the conjugate difluorocarbene complex [(CF3)3Pd(CF2)]&#8722;, which is experimentally detected. Selective single, double or triple defluorination of a CF3 group is achieved under very mild conditions.







Abstract
The homoleptic trifluoromethyl&#8208;palladium(II) complex [Pd(CF3)4]2&#8722; (1) is shown to be highly active towards amines. Thus, when treated with primary amines RNH2, it readily undergoes aminolysis of one of the CF3 ligands affording the isocyanide complexes [(CF3)3Pd(CNR)]&#8722; (R=aryl). In this process the original CF3 group undergoes total defluorination. Interestingly, the reaction of 1 with secondary amines R2NH proceeds with loss of just two F&#8208;substituents, whereby the Fischer&#8208;type fluoroaminocarbene complexes [(CF3)3Pd(CFNR2)]&#8722; are formed (R=Et, Ph). The reaction of 1 with diamines affords different [(CF3)3Pd(NHC)]&#8722; complexes containing sterically non&#8208;demanding NHC ligands. Representative examples of various topologies are reported based on the common imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene or benzimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene rings as well as the expanded&#8208;ring perimidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene. This metal&#8208;tailored synthetic route, where a CF3 group acts as a pre&#8208;carbenic unit, is unprecedented in the vast NHC&#8208;chemistry. It takes place under very mild conditions and is envisaged to be extensible to other non&#8208;isolable NHC ligands. The key difluorocarbene intermediate [(CF3)3Pd(CF2)]&#8722; is experimentally detected.

         <dc:description>
A novel tetraphenylethene&#8208;based octacationic spirobicycle has been easily synthesized via one&#8208;step bicyclization based on the size&#8208;matching strategy. Through host&#8211;guest interaction with d(GpC) dinucleotide, the spirobicycle can capture a biomimetic hydrogen&#8208;bonded G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C quadruplex within its dual cavities in the crystalline state and show the adaptive chirality sensing in the aqueous solution.







Abstract
In biological systems, nucleotide quadruplexes (such as G&#8208;quadruplexes) in DNA and RNA that are held together by multiple hydrogen bonds play a crucial functional role. The biomimetic formation of these hydrogen&#8208;bonded quadruplexes captured by artificial systems in water poses a significant challenge but can offer valuable insights into these complex functional structures. Herein, we report the formation of biomimetic hydrogen&#8208;bonded G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C quadruplex captured by a tetraphenylethene (TPE) based octacationic spirobicycle (1). The spirobicyclic compound possesses a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) crossing dual&#8208;cavity structure, which enables the encapsulation of four d(GpC) dinucleotide molecules, thereby realizing 1&#8201;:&#8201;4 host&#8211;guest complexation in water. The X&#8208;ray structure reveals that four d(GpC) molecules further form a two&#8208;layer G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C quadruplex with Watson&#8211;Crick hydrogen bonds, which are stabilized within the dual hydrophobic cavities of 1 through the cooperative non&#8208;covalent interactions of hydrogen bonds, CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions, and hydrophobic effect. Due to the dynamically&#8208;rotational propeller chirality of TPE units, 1 with adaptive chirality can further serve as a chiroptical sensor to exhibit opposite Cotton effects with mirror&#8208;image CD spectra for the pH&#8208;dependent hydrogen&#8208;bonded assemblies of d(GpC) including the Watson&#8211;Crick G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C (pH&#8197;9.22) and Hoogsteen G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C+ (pH&#8197;5.74) quartets through the host&#8211;guest chirality transfer in water.

         <title>Gas&#8208;Induced Electrical and Magnetic Modulation of Two&#8208;Dimensional Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exposure to gaseous molecules can induce characteristic electrical and magnetic property changes of a semiconductive metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). The underlying interaction mechanism responsible for the electrical and magnetic modulation is found related to the intrinsic physical and chemical properties of the participating molecules which cause specific electronic and structural changes of the MOF.







Abstract
Controlled modulation of electronic and magnetic properties in stimuli&#8208;responsive materials provides valuable insights for the design of magnetoelectric or multiferroic devices. This paper demonstrates the modulation of electrical and magnetic properties of a semiconductive, paramagnetic metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF) Cu3(C6O6)2 with small gaseous molecules, NH3, H2S, and NO. This study merges chemiresistive and magnetic tests to reveal that the MOF undergoes simultaneous changes in electrical conductance and magnetization that are uniquely modulated by each gas. The features of response, including direction, magnitude, and kinetics, are modulated by the physicochemical properties of the gaseous molecules. This study advances the design of multifunctional materials capable of undergoing simultaneous changes in electrical and magnetic properties in response to chemical stimuli.

&lt;p&gt;Controlled modulation of electronic and magnetic properties in stimuli-responsive materials provides valuable insights for the design of magnetoelectric or multiferroic devices. This paper demonstrates the modulation of electrical and magnetic properties of a semiconductive, paramagnetic metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF) Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with small gaseous molecules, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, and NO. This study merges chemiresistive and magnetic tests to reveal that the MOF undergoes simultaneous changes in electrical conductance and magnetization that are uniquely modulated by each gas. The features of response, including direction, magnitude, and kinetics, are modulated by the physicochemical properties of the gaseous molecules. This study advances the design of multifunctional materials capable of undergoing simultaneous changes in electrical and magnetic properties in response to chemical stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Functionalization of Supramolecular Polymers by Dynamic Covalent Boroxine Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boronic acid self&#8208;condensation provides ready access to boroxine&#8208;based, C3&#8208;symmetrical monomer architectures that can cooperatively assemble into helical supramolecular polymers. The dynamic boroxine scaffold enables fast intermolecular exchange of boronic acid between different monomers and facilitates the introduction of functionality into assembled structures by co&#8208;condensation with functional boronic acids.







Abstract
Molecular scaffolds that enable the combinatorial synthesis of new supramolecular building blocks are promising targets for the construction of functional molecular systems. Here, we report a supramolecular scaffold based on boroxine that enables the formation of chiral and ordered 1D supramolecular polymers, which can be easily functionalized for circularly polarized luminescence. The boroxine monomers are quantitatively synthesized in situ, both in bulk and in solution, from boronic acid precursors and cooperatively polymerize into 1D helical aggregates stabilized by threefold hydrogen&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. We then demonstrate amplification of asymmetry in the co&#8208;assembly of chiral/achiral monomers and the co&#8208;condensation of chiral/achiral precursors in classical and in situ sergeant&#8208;and&#8208;soldiers experiments, respectively, showing fast boronic acid exchange reactions occurring in the system. Remarkably, co&#8208;condensation of pyrene boronic acid with a hydrogen&#8208;bonding chiral boronic acid results in chiral pyrene aggregation with circularly polarized excimer emission and g&#8208;values in the order of 10&#8722;3. Yet, the electron deficiency of boron in boroxine makes them chemically addressable by nucleophiles, but also sensitive to hydrolysis. With this sensitivity in mind, we provide first insights into the prospects offered by boroxine&#8208;based supramolecular polymers to make chemically addressable, functional, and adaptive systems.

         <title>Germaaluminocenes&#8212;Masked Heterofulvenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity pattern of germaaluminocenes is determined by the dichotomy of the electron&#8208;deficient aluminum atom and the electron&#8208;rich germanium center. The analysis of the product spectra obtained from the reaction with standard reagents reveals the role of these main group sandwich complexes as synthetic equivalents of otherwise not accessible aluminagermapentafulvenes.







Abstract
Germaaluminocenes are formed by salt metathesis reactions of dipotassium germacyclopentadienediides with pentamethylcyclopentadienylaluminum dichloride. The reactivity pattern of these sandwich complexes is determined by the electrophilic central aluminum atom and by the nucleophilic dicoordinated germanium center. Surprisingly, the products formed by reactions with Lewis acids, Lewis bases, amphiphiles and compounds with polar double bonds are those expected from the reaction of a hypothetical aluminagermapentafulvene with these types of reagents. This suggests that germaaluminocenes are synthetic equivalents to these pentafulvenes.

         <title>A 2D Acridine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Framework for Selective Detection and Efficient Extraction of Gold from Complex Aqueous&#8208;Based Matrices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D acridine&#8208;based covalent organic framework (TpDa&#8208;COF) was prepared for the selective detection and efficient capture of gold. Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the a&#8208;photoinduced electron transfer, selective coordination and reductive process of Au(III) to Au(0) are the possible sensing and adsorption mechanisms. Furthermore, TpDa&#8208;COF exhibits ultrahigh capture efficiency (&gt;96&#8201;%) for gold in real water environments including river water, seawater and CPU leaching solutions.







Abstract
Developing candidate materials which possess the ability of both selective detection and efficient capture of precious metal gold is highly desirable for environment and economy. However, most of reported materials only focus on single function, which seriously restricts their practical application as probes or adsorbents. Herein, a two dimensional (2D) acridine&#8208;based covalent organic framework (TpDa&#8208;COF) is prepared via the linkage of imine bonds for gold detection and adsorption. The synthesized COF can achieve both fluorescence and colorimetric dual sensing for Au3+ in a low concentration range (0.1&#8211;1.5&#8197;ppm) with the limit of detection (LOD) of 0.036&#8197;ppm. Impressively, the selectivity of TpDa&#8208;COF for the detection of Au3+ is admirable (Fe3+, Fe2+ and Cu2+ for negligible influence on its fluorescence). In addition, TpDa&#8208;COF exhibits ultrahigh adsorption capacity of 982.5&#8197;mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 for gold at pH=4, which is attributed the synergistic effect of both selective coordination and reductive process of Au(III) to Au(0). Meanwhile, both positive entropy change (&#916;S=76.07&#8197;J&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;K&#8722;1) and high distribution coefficient (Kd=12484.8&#8197;mL&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1) confirm the good affinity between TpDa&#8208;COF framework and gold. This work gives us a new insight to prepare COF with pyridine nitrogen sites for gold detection and adsorption.

         <title>Strategies for Achieving Ultra&#8208;Long ORR Durability&#8212;Rh Activates Interatomic Interactions in Alloys</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By modulating the interatomic interactions between the constituent atoms of the catalyst, a novel approach has been introduced to prevent the dissolution of transition metals, resulting in ultra&#8208;long durability in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Rh&#8722;Pt3Co/C catalysts demonstrate high activity and excellent durability with low platinum group metal (PGM) loading.







Abstract
The stability of platinum&#8208;based alloy catalysts is crucial for the future development of proton exchange membrane fuel cells, considering the potential dissolution of transition metals under complex operating conditions. Here, we report on a Rh&#8208;doped Pt3Co alloy that exhibits strong interatomic interactions, thereby enhancing the durability of fuel cells. The Rh&#8722;Pt3Co/C catalyst demonstrates exceptional catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) (1.31&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 at 0.9&#8197;V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and maintaining 92&#8201;% of its mass activity after 170,000 potential cycles). Long&#8208;term testing has shown direct inhibition of Co dissolution in Rh&#8722;Pt3Co/C. Furthermore, tests on proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) have shown excellent performance and long&#8208;term durability with low Pt loading. After 50,000&#8197;cycles, there was no voltage loss at 0.8&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for Rh&#8722;Pt3Co/C, while Pt3Co/C experienced a loss of 200&#8197;mV. Theoretical calculations suggest that introducing transition metal atoms through doping creates a stronger compressive strain, which in turn leads to increased catalytic activity. Additionally, Rh doping increases the energy barrier for Co diffusion in the bulk phase, while also raising the vacancy formation energy of the surface Pt. This ensures the long&#8208;term stability of the alloy over the course of the cycle.

A Ni&#8208;catalyzed cyclization/coupling has been developed in which the products are readily linearized to permit regiodefined alkene dicarbofunctionalization. In this reaction, a silicon&#8208;oxygen (Si&#8722;O) bond functions as a detachable linker that can be delinked with several hydride, alkyl, aryl and vinyl nucleophiles to create profusely functionalized 3&#8208;hydroxysilanes.







Abstract
We disclose a Ni&#8208;catalyzed cyclization/alkylmetal interception reaction in which products are readily linearized to permit regiodefined alkene dicarbofunctionalization. This method offers a convenient route to access 1,2&#8208;oxasilolane heterocycles, 3&#8208;hydroxysilanes and 4&#8208;arylalkanols with the formation of C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds at primary and secondary alkyl carbon centers. In this reaction, a silicon&#8208;oxygen (Si&#8722;O) bond functions as a detachable linker that can be delinked with several hydride, alkyl, aryl and vinyl nucleophiles to create profusely functionalized 3&#8208;hydroxysilanes. A silicon motif in the cyclic C(sp3)&#8722;Si&#8722;O construct in 1,2&#8208;oxasilolane heterocycles can also be selectively deleted by Pd&#8208;catalyzed hydrodesilylation affording Si&#8208;ablated linear alcohol products reminiscent of vicinal ethylene dicarbofunctionalization with C(sp3) and C(sp2) carbon sources.
