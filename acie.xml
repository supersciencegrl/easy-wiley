         <title>Highly Efficient Acceptors with a Non&#8208;Aromatic Thianthrene Central Core for Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the great role in determining molecular packings and organic photovoltaic outcomes, very rare candidates could be employed as central cores in current high&#8208;performance acceptors except diimide&#8208;based moieties. Herein, a new type central core of non&#8208;aromatic thianthrene is explored firstly, affording an exotic but structurally tailorable molecular platform for acceptor design. A unique puckered rather than planar conformation of central core is adopted, caused by the 4n &#960;e&#8722; feature, great ring strain and largely the insufficient p&#8208;&#960; orbital overlap of lone pair on sulfur of thianthrene and coterminous benzene planes. As a result, the absorption of thianthrene&#8208;based acceptors (CS1, CS2 and CS3) shows unexpected blue shift comparing to the phenazine&#8208;based counterpart (CH20), regardless of the intrinsically strong electron&#8208;donating characteristic of low valence sulfur atoms. Even so, the desired molecular packing and fibrillary film morphology, assisted by the suitable chlorination on thianthrene, still contribute to the best device efficiency of 19.0% based on D18:CS2 blends. Such a novel work renders an underdeveloped NFA platform with the potentials for achieving PCE of over 20%.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Mn&#8211;Br Hybrid Perovskite Assembled by Achiral Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining rotationally symmetric [Me&#8208;Pr&#8208;dabco]2+ dications with the noncentrosymmetric [MnX4]2&#8722; coordination tetrahedra, a pair of Mn2+&#8208;based halide enantiomeric hybrids (P&#8208;1 and M&#8208;1) were self&#8208;assembled from achiral molecular architectures, which exhibit exceptionally high CPL performance with a record&#8208;high figure of merit (FM) of 4.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 and remarkable luminous brightness (74&#160;5912&#160;cd m&#8722;2) among reported Mn2+&#8208;based CPL materials.








Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active materials have attracted considerable attention due to their potential applications in various advanced technological fields. CPL activity typically requires compounds that crystallize in noncentrosymmetric chiral space groups. Achieving noncentrosymmetric crystal structures using achiral molecular architectures is highly appealing but remains a significant challenge. Herein, we present a strategy for designing and synthesizing high&#8208;performance CPL materials via crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly using achiral architectures. We successfully obtained Mn2+&#8208;based halide enantiomeric hybrids (P&#8208;1 and M&#8208;1), self&#8208;assembled from [MnBr4]2&#8722; anions and rotational symmetric [Pr&#8208;dabco]2+ cations (Pr&#8208;dabco2+ = 1&#8208;propyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo&#8208;[2.2.2]octan&#8208;1&#8208;ium), crystallizing in the chiral space group P212121. The single crystals of 1 exhibit exceptionally high CPL performance, with a luminescence dissymmetry factor |glum| and photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) up to 4.8&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 and 86.8%, respectively, thus a record&#8208;high figure of merit (FM) of 4.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 among reported Mn2+&#8208;based CPL materials. Furthermore, P/M&#8208;1 based UV&#8208;LED devices demonstrated outstanding light&#8208;emitting performance, including high color&#8208;purity, excellent stability, remarkable luminous brightness (74&#160;591.94&#160;cd m&#8722;2), and a high electroluminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) value of 3.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2. This study offers a robust strategy for the design and development of high&#8208;performance CPL materials utilizing achiral molecular architectures.

         <title>Management of Intramolecular Noncovalent Interactions in Dopant&#8208;Free Hole Transport Materials for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic semiconductors with intramolecular noncovalent interactions are promising hole transport materials (HTMs) for efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but the effects of different types of noncovalent bonds on the properties of HTMs are rarely reported. Here, three thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole (TzTz)&#8208;based HTMs with different side chains were developed. Compared with alkyl side chains, functional side chains can improve the crystallinity and charge transport ability of HTMs by forming intramolecular noncovalent interactions. However, the steric hindrance of S&#183;&#183;&#183;O in TzTzTPA&#8208;SO distorted the molecular skeleton, leading to edge&#8208;on stacking and local aggregation of film. Fortunately, TzTzTPA&#8208;NH with intramolecular hydrogen bond showed high planarity, proper crystallinity and preferred stacking orientation. Consequently, a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.2% with a nice long&#8208;term stability was achieved by dopant&#8208;free TzTzTPA&#8208;NH&#8208;based PSCs, which is superior to the doped Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD&#8208;based PSCs. In addition, TzTzTPA&#8208;NH is well used as HTM in wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs and perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (TSCs). Encouragingly, the TSCs based on TzTzTPA&#8208;NH achieved an excellent PCE of 25.4%, which is the highest PCE of n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite/organic TSCs. This work clearly illustrates the effect of intramolecular noncovalent interactions on the properties of HTMs, and provides guidance for designing high&#8208;performance dopant&#8208;free HTMs in PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Simple "Directional Trimming" Strategy engineered Platinum Atomic Clusters with Controllable Coordination Numbers for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The coordination number (CN) in atomic cluster (AC) catalysts endows their catalytic performance with flexible tunability. However, the quantitative relationship between the coordination number (CN) and catalytic activity of atomic cluster (AC) catalysts remains ambiguity. Herein, inspired by the gardeners trimming plants branches to obtain ornamental value shape. We propose a &#8220;directional trimming&#8221; strategy to obtain a series of AC catalysts with wide range of Cl CN and establish an inverted volcano curve to explain the effect of CN on hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Moreover, Pt/CB&#8208;90 (moderate Cl CN of 3.7) exhibits the lowest overpotential of 22.94 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 and outstanding mass activity (25 times to commercial Pt/C). This proposed synthesis strategy fully utilizes the precursor atoms and is widely applicable. The reaction liquid can be reused up to 20 times to obtain 1130 mg catalysts without introducing any other chemicals. Additionally, Theoretical calculations highlight the appropriate Cl CN benefits the HER on Pt2 ACs. This fundamental understanding of the role of CN in catalytic activity offers valuable guidance to promote performance in various catalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling the Surface Chemistry of Aluminum Oxo Archimedean Cages for Efficient Serial Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multifunctional materials that meet diverse application needs hold profound significance in resource optimization, efficiency enhancement, and environmental sustainability. However, the development of these materials faces numerous challenges, including raw material acquisition, design feasibility, and long&#8208;term stability. This study demonstrates the innovative application of the surface chemistry of aluminum oxo Archimedean cages in efficient serial adsorption. The "Four&#8208;in&#8208;One" surface chemistry enables various single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SC&#8208;SC) structural transformations, involving ligand modification, cation exchange, post&#8208;synthetic metalation, and metal elimination, successfully achieving the first reversible SC&#8208;SC transformation from cluster structures to infinite frameworks. The fundamental reason behind these dynamic structural changes lies in the exceptional balance between rigidity and flexibility provided by the intercluster tri&#8208;pyrazole sites on the Archimedean cages. This diverse structural transformation characteristic offers extensive application potential for solid&#8208;liquid and solid&#8208;gas serial adsorption. For instance, this material effectively adsorbs heavy metal ions in water treatment and can subsequently be used for the permanent fixation of gaseous radionuclides. This work not only deepens our understanding of dynamic chemistry but also provides practical solutions for environmental remediation.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Multifunctional materials that meet diverse application needs hold profound significance in resource optimization, efficiency enhancement, and environmental sustainability. However, the development of these materials faces numerous challenges, including raw material acquisition, design feasibility, and long-term stability. This study demonstrates the innovative application of the surface chemistry of aluminum oxo Archimedean cages in efficient serial adsorption. The "Four-in-One" surface chemistry enables various single-crystal-to-single-crystal (SC-SC) structural transformations, involving ligand modification, cation exchange, post-synthetic metalation, and metal elimination, successfully achieving the first reversible SC-SC transformation from cluster structures to infinite frameworks. The fundamental reason behind these dynamic structural changes lies in the exceptional balance between rigidity and flexibility provided by the intercluster tri-pyrazole sites on the Archimedean cages. This diverse structural transformation characteristic offers extensive application potential for solid-liquid and solid-gas serial adsorption. For instance, this material effectively adsorbs heavy metal ions in water treatment and can subsequently be used for the permanent fixation of gaseous radionuclides.

         <title>Synthetic Reversible Fibrous Network Hydrogels Based on a Double&#8208;Helical Polyelectrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unique mechanical properties of fibrous networks in biological tissues have inspired the development of synthetic fibrous network hydrogels, yet few polymers can reversibly form such structures. Here, we report the first reversible fibrous network hydrogel composed of synthetic polyelectrolytes with extremely rigid conformation (persistence length is ~1 &#956;m), made up of double&#8208;helical poly(2,2'&#8208;disulfonyl&#8208;4,4'&#8208;benzidine terephthalamide) (PBDT) and tetrabutylphosphonium bromide ([P4444]Br). The hydrogel exhibits a unique sol&#8208;gel transition, triggered by the hydrophobicity increase of [P4444]Br above lower critical solution temperature (LCST). This drives PBDT aggregation into fibrous bundles through electrostatic interactions. These bundles grow and branch into a continuous network, with the molecular rigidity of PBDT&#8217;s double&#8208;helix conformation being key to gel formation. The hydrogel displays strain&#8208;stiffening mechanical responses akin to biological systems and shows a significant hysteresis (21 &#176;C) between heating and cooling cycles. Uniquely, the effects of salts on the transition temperature deviate from the Hofmeister series, highlighting coordination with sulfonate groups as the dominant factor. Leveraging its modulus change during gelation, the hydrogel was successfully applied as a spray coating on superhydrophobic vertical Teflon surfaces. This study broadens the scope of thermoreversible hydrogels introducing gelation mechanisms for rigid polyelectrolytes and demonstrates their potential in advanced coatings.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecularly Designed Cathode for Copper&#8208;Benzimidazole&#8208;Induced CO2 Reduction to MeOH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into value&#8208;added products is aimed to develop scalable technologies to promote circular economy. While the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to carbon monoxide (CO) and formic acid has advanced significantly, a major challenge remains: achieving further reduced and more energy&#8208;dense products, such as methanol (MeOH), through sustainable pathways. Herein we report, a molecular electrode capable of direct six&#8208;electron reduction of CO2 to MeOH using water as a proton source with a global faradaic efficiency (FEG) of 22% and product selectivity of 61% for MeOH. The design consists of an active copper&#8208;hydride center surrounded by two closely spaced benzimidazole&#8208;hydride units, facilitating the catalytic transfer of three hydrides to produce MeOH. The concurrent formation of formic acid and the absence of formaldehyde suggest that MeOH is generated via a formato pathway. DFT investigations revealed the complete mechanistic pathway which supports the experimental observations. The morphology and stability of the electrode were evaluated before and after prolonged electrolysis (12 h) experiments using electron microscopic techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;high Optical Anisotropy with UV Transmission Achieved by Rational Arrangement of Extended &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Birefringent material serves as a cornerstone in photonic applications, including optical communications, polarization control, and laser technologies. The development of birefringent materials with large birefringence (&#916;n &gt; 0.3) and short ultraviolet (UV) cut&#8208;off edge (&#955;cut&#8208;off edge &lt; 400 nm) remains a significant challenge. Here, we demonstrate that properly aligned expanded &#960;&#8208;conjugated groups provide a solution to balance the birefringence and UV transmittance. We report a new birefringent material, Li3(C9N13)&#183;6H2O (LCN), in which the Li atoms and water molecules act as linkers to connect the birefringence&#8208;active group [C9N13]. This crystal material exhibits a giant optical anisotropy (&#916;nexp = 1.031 @ 546 nm), which is one of the highest among bulk crystal materials known to date. In addition, LCN shows a band gap of 3.62 eV, indicating its applicability in the UV optical range. Owing to favorable Li cation linkers and hydrogen bonding, the [C9N13] groups achieve a perfectly coplanar arrangement, thereby maximizing the optical anisotropy. This work offers a novel strategy for the rational design of advanced birefringent materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>2,3&#8208;Dialkylindoles play crucial roles in natural products and pharmaceuticals, but the step&#8208;efficient and regioselective construction of such privileged structures remains a long&#8208;standing challenge.

         <title>Intermolecular Toroidal Conjugation: Circularly Stacked 16 &#960;&#8208;Planes Formed by Supramolecular Assembly Enabling Cyclic Charge and Energy Delocalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Toroidal conjugation is a unique way of charge and exciton delocalization via through&#8208;space overlap among circularly stacked &#960;&#8208;orbitals, but the examples have been limited to intramolecular phenomena where &#960;&#8208;planes are arranged around a hub molecule. In this study, we extend this concept to intermolecular phenomena and demonstrate the first example of intermolecular toroidal conjugation in designed systems, in which a circular &#960;&#8208;stacked array is formed by molecular self&#8208;assembly. X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal analysis unequivocally revealed a toroidal array of 16 &#960;&#8208;planes formed by the supramolecular dimerization of phthalocyanines substituted with eight pillar&#8208;like diazapentacenes interdigitating their &#960;&#8208;pillars. The experimentally determined interplanar distances in the toroidal &#960;&#8208;stacking array were close enough to realize through&#8208;space conjugation. We investigated the existence of charge and exciton delocalization in the toroidal &#960;&#8208;stacking array using various steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopies and found that the positive charge migrated in the toroidal &#960;&#8208;stacking array in the cationic and photoexcited states.</dc:description>

         <title>Crosslinking Profiling of Molecular Glue Degrader&#8208;Induced E3 Ligase Interactome to Expand Target Space</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular glue (MG) degraders, small molecules with significant therapeutic potential for targeting undruggable proteins, are emerging as new modality in drug discovery. Profiling the E3 ligase interactome induced by MG degraders provides insights into their mechanism of action and identifies clinically relevant neo&#8208;substrates for degradation, thereby offering new therapeutic opportunities. However, established methods face significant challenges in comprehensive and accurate profiling of MG degrader&#8208;induced E3 ligase interactome. Herein, we introduce the concept of globally crosslinking profiling of the MG degrader&#8208;induced E3 ligase interactome in living cells, achieved by integrating genetic code expansion technology with mass spectrometry&#8208;based proteomics. Our approach presents an efficient and robust strategy for identifying neo&#8208;substrates recruited to cereblon E3 ligase by the known degraders CC&#8208;885 and DKY709, offering valuable insights for clinical evaluation and significantly expanding their target space. Moreover, we developed two novel MG degraders with potent anti&#8208;proliferative effects on cancer cells, and application of our method identified neo&#8208;substrates, revealing a previously unrecognized target landscape and advancing our understanding of E3 ligase&#8211;neo&#8208;substrate interactions. Overall, our study provides a powerful tool for neo&#8208;substrate identification and expanding target space of E3 ligase, opening new opportunities for developing next&#8208;generation MG degraders to address the clinical challenge of undruggable targets.</dc:description>

Herein, we introduce the concept of globally crosslinking profiling of the MG degrader-induced E3 ligase interactome in living cells, achieved by integrating genetic code expansion technology with mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Our approach presents an efficient and robust strategy for identifying neo-substrates recruited to cereblon E3 ligase by the known degraders CC-885 and DKY709, offering valuable insights for clinical evaluation and significantly expanding their target space. Moreover, we developed two novel MG degraders with potent anti-proliferative effects on cancer cells, and application of our method identified neo-substrates, revealing a previously unrecognized target landscape and advancing our understanding of E3 ligase&#8211;neo-substrate interactions. Overall, our study provides a powerful tool for neo-substrate identification and expanding target space of E3 ligase, opening new opportunities for developing next-generation MG degraders to address the clinical challenge of undruggable targets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Isolation of a Square Pyramidal Bis(amidophenolate)&#8208;supported As(III)&#8208;Cation: Coordination&#8208;Induced Electromerism at As</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and structural characterization of a slightly distorted square pyramidal arsenium cation is reported. Spectroscopic, crystallographic and computational evidence indicates that coordination of typical Lewis&#8208;bases to the As(III)&#8208;center induces its oxidation to As(V) with concomitant reduction of the supporting, redox&#8208;active, bis(amidophenolate) ligand. That reaction is reversible and represents a well&#8208;defined example of base&#8208;induced electromerism in an As&#8208;complex. Single electron reduction of the same As(III) species initially generates a ligand&#8208;centered radical, which is persistent enough to be observed by EPR, but slowly decays to an heterodimer. Preliminary experiments demonstrate the utility of the As(III)&#8208;cation as initiator for transfer hydrogenation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>A Light&#8208;driven Electrochromic Materials&#8208;Based Nanomotor for H2S&#8208;Controlled Drug Release in Synergistic Cancer Chemotherapy Immunotherapy.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanomotors hold tremendous potential for drug delivery. However, current nanomotors face limitations that compromise efficiency of drug utilization, including the use of inorganic materials with suboptimal soft interface and biocompatibility, uncontrollable drug release, insufficient directional control and slow movement speeds. Herein, we present a novel near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;driven porous unsymmetric nanomotor with ultrafast motion, which utilizes hydrogen sulfide (H2S)&#8208;responsive cationic organic &#960;&#8208;electron structure&#8208;based electrochromic material (F12+) for the payload and controlled release of anionic anticancer drugs, enabling synergistic cancer chemotherapy and immunotherapy. We demonstrate that the nanomotor can precisely target tumors driven by thermophoresis, tumor&#8208;targeting peptide (RGD) and H2S (highly expressed in tumors and acted as chemoattractants), which induces chemotactic behavior to guide nanomotors into tumors. Once in the tumors, the cationic F12+ is reduced to the diene F2 upon reaction with H2S, activating the nanomotor&#8217;s NIR fluorescence for real&#8208;time monitoring of drug delivery and release in vivo. Upon exposure to H2S, the nanomotor undergoes disassembly due to the disruption of electrostatic interactions between the anionic anticancer drugs and the cationic F12+, leading to the precise and controlled drug release, ensuring uniform distribution across the tumor. This innovative strategy would open avenues for delivering mRNA vaccines or other anionic drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Dimensional Ni@TiN/CNT Heterostructure with Tandem Catalysis for Efficient Electrochemical&#160;Nitrite Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical nitrite reduction reaction (NO2RR) is considered as a sustainable ammonia (NH3) synthesis strategy. However, there are still significant challenges in designing efficient NO2RR catalysts. Here, carbon nanotube (CNT) encapsulated Ni nanoparticles (NPs) loaded on MXene&#8208;derived TiN (Ni@TiN/CNT) heterostructure is constructed by combining molten salt etching strategy and chemical vapor deposition. Ni@TiN/CNT exhibits excellent NH3 yield rate (15.6 mg h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1), Faradaic efficiency (95.6%) and record cycle stability (NO2RR performance is virtually unattenuated after 60 cycles) at &#8722;0.7 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE). In addition, the Zn&#8208;nitrite battery with Ni@TiN/CNT as the cathode shows high power density (9.6 mW cm&#8722;2) and NH3 synthesis performance. Combining validation experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal that Ni@TiN/CNT follows the tandem catalytic mechanism. The TiN site preferentially adsorbs and activates NO2&#8722;, while the Ni site provides abundant active hydrogen for the subsequent reduction process. Meanwhile, the chainmail structure of CNT prevents the oxidation and leaching of active sites, thereby significantly enhancing the stability of Ni@TiN/CNT. This work provides a new inspiration for the preparation of durable and efficient NO2RR electrocatalysts with tandem catalytic sites.</dc:description>

         <title>High Entropy Deep Eutectic Solvent Achieves Ultra&#8208;Low Polarization Zinc Anode Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deep eutectic solvents (DESs), a new class of green solvents, have emerged as promising candidates for electrolytes due to their exceptional electrochemical stability. However, the DES always exhibits unacceptable polarization of cells due to its high viscosity and low ionic conductivity, which limit its practical application in batteries. In this work, the cell polarization of DES is effectively reduced to a level comparable to that of pure aqueous electrolytes by increasing the entropy of DES via disorder&#8208;making strategy of solvation structure. Theoretically, construct the high entropy deep eutectic solvent (HEDES) promotes the formation of more aggregates with high disorder, which accelerates mass transfer kinetics. As a result, the proposed HEDES (configuration entropy 17 times higher than traditional electrolyte) can achieve durable zinc plating/stripping behavior for more than 2000 h with low polarization, and still maintain good stability even in extreme environments. The cylindrical zinc&#8208;ion capacitor under gram&#8208;level loading can achieve a high discharge current up to 3 A, providing ideas for the design of electrolytes for zinc&#8208;based energy storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Methyl Group Reinforced Amphiphilic Poly(Ionic Liquid) Additive for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8211;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amphiphilic polymer additive PVEMA was polymerized by imidazole ionic liquid and methacrylamide to fast Zn2+ diffusion rate, inhibit shuttle effect of polyiodides for cathode and alleviate the side reactions on Zn anode. Moreover, the &#945;&#8208;methyl group can enhance the hydrophobic property of polymer for further side reaction resistance, thus rendering the Zn&#8211;I2 battery with stable cycling and rate performances at various scenario.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8211;I2) batteries are prospective on energy storage, yet the practical application is severely hindered by side reactions of Zn metal and the shuttle effects for polyiodide. Herein, a polymer additive was copolymerized by 1&#8208;vinyl&#8208;3&#8208;ethylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate (VEImOTf) and methacrylamide (MAAm) (PVEMA) to alleviate the above issues. The polymer chain of PVEMA endows amphipathic properties for Zn2+ diffusion and solvation structure regulation, and the &#945;&#8208;methyl of MAAm enhances the hydrophobic properties to avoid side reactions on Zn metal. In addition, the imidazole groups adsorb onto Zn metal with electrostatic shielding effect for further side reaction alleviation and mitigate shuttle effects by electrostatic interactions with polyiodides. Consequently, the PVEMA confers the symmetrical Zn battery with great cycling stability for over 400&#160;h at 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and high depth of discharge (DOD) of 77.7%. The Zn&#8211;I2 batteries with PVEMA also demonstrate stable cycling performance under various current densities and temperatures.

         <title>Engineering Aqueous Electrolytes with Vicinal S&#8208;based Organic Additives for Highly Reversible Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile sulfur&#8208;based organic electrolyte additive, 3,3&#8242;&#8208;dithiobis&#8208;1&#8208;propanesulfonic acid disodium salt (SPS), has been introduced in aqueous electrolyte, enabling dense (100) growth through a unique symmetrically aligned concentration&#8208;controlled adsorption network, affording structural uniformity and compactness to the Zn deposit layer. SPS additive afforded stabilization of the Zn anode under severe testing conditions with high reversibility.








Abstract
The commercial deployment of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) is hampered by dendrites, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and corrosion reactions. To tackle these challenges, we have introduced 3,3&#8242;&#8208;dithiobis&#8208;1&#8208;propanesulfonic acid disodium salt (SPS), a symmetrical sulfur&#8208;based organic salt, as an electrolyte additive for AZIBs.

As validation, the Zn/NaV3O8&#183;1.35H2O cell with SPS&#8208;additive afforded high cycling stabilization and excellent capacity retention of 95.5%.

&lt;p&gt;A versatile sulfur-based organic electrolyte additive, 3,3&#8242;-dithiobis-1-propanesulfonic acid disodium salt (SPS), has been introduced in aqueous electrolyte, enabling dense (100) growth through a unique symmetrically aligned concentration-controlled adsorption network, affording structural uniformity and compactness to the Zn deposit layer. SPS additive afforded stabilization of the Zn anode under severe testing conditions with high reversibility.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commercial deployment of aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) is hampered by dendrites, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and corrosion reactions. To tackle these challenges, we have introduced 3,3&#8242;-dithiobis-1-propanesulfonic acid disodium salt (SPS), a symmetrical sulfur-based organic salt, as an electrolyte additive for AZIBs. Unlike conventional electrolyte additives that favor (002) deposition, SPS enables dense (100) growth through a unique symmetrically aligned concentration-controlled adsorption network, affording structural uniformity and compactness to the Zn deposit layer. The dual-action symmetrical SPS additive adsorbs onto the Zn surface via vicinal sulfur atoms, blocking electrolyte access to the Zn anode, enhancing the transportation kinetics of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and simultaneously promoting desolvation by displacing water molecules from the solvation shell.

         <title>Activating Molybdenum Peroxide Scissors for Converting Polyamide Plastic into Low Carbon Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise molybdenum peroxide scissors, composed of localized radicals on quasi&#8208;2D Mo&#8208;O sheets, are activated by H2O2 through a ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer process to upgrade micro&#8208;scale Polyamide 6 to low carbon alcohols with exceptionally high efficiency and selectivity.








Abstract
Direct chemical conversion of plastic waste into low&#8208;carbon oxygenates, rather than carbon dioxide, with renewable energy, is important yet challenging. Due to high C&#9472;X (X&#9552;C, H, N) bond energy, fully optimized catalysts are required to enable precise bond cleavage for boosted efficiency and selectivity. Here, adaptable and recyclable molybdenum peroxide photocatalysts that demonstrate chemical scissors for the selective conversion of polyamide to alcohols are reported. It shows that dimensionally adaptable Mo(+5.8)&#8208;(O2) is activated via a ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) process for localized catalysis to precisely cleave C&#9472;X bonds into C2 and C1 alcohols. The additional hydrogen peroxide facilitates the activation and regeneration of the catalytic scissors. These scissors ultimately cut PA6 into methanol with an efficiency of 2.55&#160;mmol&#160;L&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and a selectivity of 82.4&#160;%. This work provides insights into the role of adaptable metal peroxides in precisely cutting C&#9472;X bonds, which benefits chemical conversion of plastic wastes.

         <title>Hydrogen Bond Network Assisted Ultrafast Ion Transport of Anion Exchange Membrane Grafting with Covalent Organic Frameworks for Hydrogen Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent Organic Frameworks (COF) grafted polymers not only achieve high ionic transport but also maintain the mechanical stability of the membrane. The tailored COFs contain abundant polar groups, such as &#9472;NH, &#9472;OH, C&#9552;N, and &#9472;O&#9472;, particularly the &#9472;OH groups, which form a well&#8208;developed hydrogen bond network within the membrane, thereby facilitating the rapid transport of hydroxide ions by the Grotthuss mechanism.








Abstract
The development of anion exchange membranes (AEMs) capable of facilitating rapid hydroxide ion transport, while maintaining robust mechanical stability, is considered a key direction for advancing hydrogen energy conversion systems. Herein, we synthesized a series of AEMs by grafting covalent organic frameworks (COFs) onto triphenylpiperidine copolymer and systematically evaluated the performance of AEMs. The tailored COFs, characterized by an extensive hydrogen bond network and high micro&#8208;porosity, created interconnected high&#8208;speed ion transport channels, significantly reducing the resistance to hydroxide ion conduction. Remarkably, the COF&#8208;grafted membranes exhibited superior ionic conductivity compared to pristine triphenylpiperidine, even at lower ion exchange capacities. Additionally, the crystalline and highly rigid structure of the grafted COFs effectively preserved the mechanical stability of the membranes. The optimized COF&#8208;grafted AEMs demonstrated outstanding performance, achieving a peak power density of 1.54&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 in H2&#8211;O2 fuel cells and exceptional current densities of 4.5&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 2.0&#160;V in 1&#160;m KOH and 1.1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 2.0&#160;V in pure water at 80&#160;&#176;C. The present work provides an effective strategy for enhancing AEM performance through the grafting of COFs.

         <title>Low&#8208;Coordination Triangular Cu3 Motif Steers CO2 Photoreduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;high&#8208;loading Cu multi&#8208;atom catalyst with low&#8208;coordination triangular Cu3 motifs (Cu3 MAC) on polymeric carbon nitride mesoporous nanofibers is developed, which accelerates asymmetric C&#9472;C coupling with unique adsorption configuration of bridge&#8208;adsorbed *CO at paired Cu sites and atop&#8208;adsorbed *CO at adjacent single Cu atom, thus enabling preferential formation of *CHCHOH intermediates to produce ethanol.








Abstract
Photoreduction of CO2 using copper&#8208;based multi&#8208;atom catalysts (MACs) offers a potential approach to achieve value&#8208;added C2+ products. However, achieving MACs with high metal contents and suppressing the thermodynamically favored competing ethylene production pathway remain challenging, thus leading to unsatisfactory performance in ethanol production. Herein, we developed a &#8220;pre&#8208;locking and nanoconfined polymerization&#8221; strategy for synthesis of an ultra&#8208;high&#8208;density Cu MAC with low&#8208;coordination triangular Cu3 motifs (Cu3 MAC) on polymeric carbon nitride mesoporous nanofibers. The Cu3 MAC with Cu contents of 36&#8201;wt% achieves a high reactivity of 117 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 for ethanol production from CO2 and H2O, with a remarkable selectivity of 98% under simulated sunlight irradiation, representing one of the highest performances in ambient conditions without sacrificial reagents. The superior catalytic efficiency is attributed to the triangular Cu3 configuration, in which both Cu(I) and Cu(II) coexist, predominantly as Cu(I). Such Cu3 motifs act as strong alkaline sites that effectively chemisorb and activate CO2, extend visible&#8208;light absorption range, while accumulating high&#8208;density electrons and favoring 12&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer products. An accelerated asymmetric C&#9472;C coupling with adsorption configuration of the bridge&#8208;adsorbed *CO at paired Cu sites and atop&#8208;adsorbed *CO at adjacent single Cu atom was observed, enabling preferential formation of *CHCHOH intermediates to produce ethanol.

         <title>The Cooperative Effects of the Rh&#8208;M Dual&#8208;Metal Atomic Pairs in Formic Acid Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Rh&#8208;M dual atomic pairs (M&#160;=&#160;V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) anchored on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon catalysts (DAP&#8208;(M, Rh)/CN) have been synthesized via a host&#8208;guest strategy. DAP&#8208;(Cr, Rh)/CN shows the highest mass activity toward formic acid oxidation among the reported catalysts as far as it is known. The most suitable adsorption strength of HCOO on the Cr sites cooperated with the acceptance of H on the Rh sites and accelerated the FAOR rates.








Abstract
The continuously increasing mass activity of precious metal in formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR) is the key to achieving the practical application of direct formic acid fuel cells (DFAFCs). Herein, Rh&#8208;based dual&#8208;metal atomic pairs supported on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon catalysts [DAP&#8208;(M, Rh)/CN] with adjacent interatomic Rh&#8208;M (M = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) have been synthesized by a &#8220;host&#8208;guest&#8221; strategy. It is discovered that DAP&#8208;(Cr, Rh)/CN shows the highest mass activity of 64.1&#160;A&#160;mg&#8722;1, which is 3.8 times higher than that of the single atom Rh catalyst (17.0&#160;A&#160;mg&#8722;1) and two orders of magnitude higher than Pd/C (0.58&#160;A&#160;mg&#8722;1). Interestingly, the mass activity of DAP&#8208;(M, Rh)/CN first increases from 11.7&#160;A&#160;mg&#8722;1 (Rh&#8208;V) to 64.1&#160;A&#160;mg&#8722;1 (Rh&#8208;Cr) and then decreases to 21.8&#160;A&#160;mg&#8722;1 (Rh&#8208;Cu), forming a volcano curve of the reaction activity. Density functional theory calculations combined with in situ Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) spectra reveal that formic acid oxidized on a series of DAP&#8208;(M, Rh)/CN catalysts through the formate route with the subsidiary M metal atoms binding the HCOO species and the Rh atom accepting the H atoms.

     alt="The Cooperative Effects of the Rh-M Dual-Metal Atomic Pairs in Formic Acid Oxidation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of Rh-M dual atomic pairs (M&#160;=&#160;V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon catalysts (DAP-(M, Rh)/CN) have been synthesized via a host-guest strategy. DAP-(Cr, Rh)/CN shows the highest mass activity toward formic acid oxidation among the reported catalysts as far as it is known. The most suitable adsorption strength of HCOO on the Cr sites cooperated with the acceptance of H on the Rh sites and accelerated the FAOR rates.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The continuously increasing mass activity of precious metal in formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR) is the key to achieving the practical application of direct formic acid fuel cells (DFAFCs). Herein, Rh-based dual-metal atomic pairs supported on nitrogen-doped carbon catalysts [DAP-(M, Rh)/CN] with adjacent interatomic Rh-M (M = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) have been synthesized by a &#8220;host-guest&#8221; strategy. It is discovered that DAP-(Cr, Rh)/CN shows the highest mass activity of 64.1&#160;A&#160;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is 3.8 times higher than that of the single atom Rh catalyst (17.0&#160;A&#160;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and two orders of magnitude higher than Pd/C (0.58&#160;A&#160;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Interestingly, the mass activity of DAP-(M, Rh)/CN first increases from 11.7&#160;A&#160;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (Rh-V) to 64.1&#160;A&#160;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (Rh-Cr) and then decreases to 21.8&#160;A&#160;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (Rh-Cu), forming a volcano curve of the reaction activity. Density functional theory calculations combined with in situ Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) spectra reveal that formic acid oxidized on a series of DAP-(M, Rh)/CN catalysts through the formate route with the subsidiary M metal atoms binding the HCOO species and the Rh atom accepting the H atoms. The most suitable adsorption strength of HCOO on the Cr sites luckily contributes to two spontaneous elementary steps and thus accelerates the FAOR rates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anode Engineering with pH&#8208;neutral Conjugated Polyelectrolyte Enabling over 19% Efficiency in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The lack of effective hole&#8208;transporting layers (HTLs) materials has become a significant bottleneck in the advancement of organic solar cells (OSCs). Particularly, to obtain sufficient doping property, most HTLs have to be used by mixing with substantial amounts of acid, which causes serious corrosion problems. Herein, by optimizing molecular conformation, we designed and synthesized two conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) that exhibited superior hole&#8208;transporting capability without involving the addition of acid. The PEP&#8208;BT features a planar conjugated backbone constructed from non&#8208;fused segment, which leads to an enhanced doping effect, highly ordered molecular arrangement and reduced &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking from 4.13 &#197; to 3.85 &#197;. These contributed to the outstanding hole collection performance of polyoxometalate&#8208;doped PEP&#8208;BT:POM while maintaining a neutral pH. The binary OSC showed a photovoltaic efficiency of 19.16%, demonstrating an unprecedented example that a CPE&#8208;based HTL can provide a photovoltaic efficiency exceeding 19% in OSCs. Moreover, as an another evidence of high&#8208;performance HTL, the organic light&#8208;emitting diode by incorporating PEP&#8208;BT:POM exhibited a superior luminous efficiency to the reference device, along with a decrease of 0.4 V for turn&#8208;on voltage. The results from this work demonstrates the great potential of CPEs as high&#8208;performance HTL materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Role of Interfacial Water in Improving the Activity and Stability of Lattice&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Mediated Acidic Oxygen Evolution on RuO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The free&#8208;H2O&#8208;enriched local environment is conducive to reducing the energy barrier of interfacial water dissociation, realizing the continuous supply of the available reactants, and leading to the dynamic balance between consumption and replenishment for lattice oxygen atoms in RuS0.45Ox.








Abstract
Although RuO2&#8208;based electrocatalysts have been widely studied for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), triggering the conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism to suppress kinetically favorable lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) pathway at the expense of activity is the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategy. To date, approaches to simultaneously achieve remarkable activity and stability of RuO2&#8208;based electrocatalysts through the kinetically favorable LOM pathway toward acidic OER are still elusive. Herein, we report that RuS0.45Ox catalyst with the synergetic regulation of asymmetric S&#8211;Ru&#8211;O microstructure and Ru&#8211;SO4 local environments can simultaneously boost the lattice&#8208;oxygen&#8208;mediated OER activity and stability under acidic electrolyte. Experimental results, including operando attenuated total reflectance surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy, operando X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and theoretical studies, indicate the dynamic evolution of interfacial water structure from hydrogen&#8208;bond water to free&#8208;H2O on the surface of RuS0.45Ox. The generated continuous free&#8208;H2O&#8208;enriched local environment is in favor of accelerating the sluggish kinetics of interfacial water dissociation and facilitating the replenishment of lattice oxygen vacancies generated during the lattice&#8208;oxygen&#8208;mediated OER process, thereby significantly enhancing the stability. Consequently, the obtained RuS0.45Ox displays remarkable acidic OER performance with 160&#160;mV to reach 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and robust stability with negligible activity decay over 500 h at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Guiding Design of Mn&#8208;Rich Phosphate Cathodes with Less Intrinsic Antisite Defects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introduction of lower valence metal cations (vs. Ti4+) with lower electronegativity (vs. Ti4+) and good solid solubility in Na3MnTi(PO4)3 system can not only construct a sodium&#8208;rich environment to reduce the possibility of Mn occupying sodium vacancies but also enhance interatomic interactions of Mn&#9472;O bond to restrain Mn delocalization, synergistically reducing the intrinsic&#8208;antisite&#8208;defects (IASDs) of Mn2+&#8208;occupied Na vacancies (Mn/Na&#9633;) in structure.








Abstract
The serious voltage hysteresis phenomenon in Na3MnTi(PO4)3 has received extensive research interests, which is determined by the intrinsic&#8208;antisite&#8208;defects (IASDs) of Mn2+ resided in Na vacancies (Mn/Na&#9633;) in structure. However, a general guideline to decrease IASDs is still lacking for the design of a higher&#8208;performance Na3MnTi(PO4)3 system. Herein, we find that generation of Mn/Na&#9633; IASDs in Na3MnTi(PO4)3 system is mainly related to Na vacancies and weaker Mn&#9472;O bonds in structure. The more Na vacancies, the more probability for Mn2+ occupation on Na sites. Meanwhile, the weaker Mn&#9472;O bond, the more probability for Mn2+ delocalization/migration to other sites, finally leading to the Mn/Na&#9633; IASDs. To decrease Mn/Na&#9633; IASDs, we propose to introduce dopants with lower valence (vs. Ti4+), lower electronegativity (vs. Ti4+), and good solid solubility in Na3MnTi(PO4)3 system. Based on the guiding rule, we have selected several doping cations (including Cr3+, Ti3+, Fe3+, and V3+) to construct a Na&#8208;rich environment and enhance Mn&#9472;O strength. Among various dopants, the substitution of V3+ for Ti4+ leads to the strongest Mn&#8211;O interaction, thus demonstrating the most effective suppression of Mn/Na&#9633; IASDs. With these discoveries, we further developed a series of V&#8208;doped Mn&#8208;richer phosphate cathodes, Na3.3+yMn1.15VyTi0.85&#8208;y(PO4)3 (0.1&#160;&#8804;&#160;y&#160;&#8804;&#160;0.25) as the promising candidates for Na&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>SiO2 Nanoparticles&#8208;Induced Antifreezing Hydrogel Electrolyte Enables Zn&#8211;I2 Batteries with Complete and Reversible Four&#8208;Electron&#8208;Transfer Mechanisms at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An antifreezing hydrogel electrolyte (HC&#8208;SiO2) is developed through the gelation of a high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (1&#160;m Zn(OAc)2 + 21&#160;m LiCl, HC) with SiO2 nanoparticles. The interactions between negatively charged SiO2 surface and cations facilitate a reduction in close ion&#8208;pairs (CIPs) and aggregations (AGGs) by dissociating ion&#8208;pairs, which alleviates salt precipitation in the concentrated electrolyte and further lowers the freezing point, enabling low&#8208;temperature operation of quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8211;I2 batteries with complete and reversible I&#8722;/I2/I+Cl&#8722; processes.

Four&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine batteries hold significant promise for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their high specific capacities. However, achieving four&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer mechanisms under subzero temperatures remains challenging due to freezing point limitations of conventional aqueous electrolytes and sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, an antifreezing hydrogel electrolyte (HC&#8208;SiO2) is developed through the spontaneous gelation of a high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (1&#160;m Zn(OAc)2 + 21&#160;m LiCl, HC) with SiO2 nanoparticles, enabling low&#8208;temperature operation of quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8211;I2 batteries with complete and reversible four&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer processes. Abundant interactions between dispersed SiO2 nanoparticles and cations enlarge ion&#8208;pair distances, reducing close ion&#8208;pair formation and lowering the freezing temperature (&#8722;60.7&#160;&#176;C). Furthermore, the quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state hydrogel electrolyte combines advantages of reduced water activity and disrupted hydrogen&#8208;bond networks, effectively suppressing I+ hydrolysis while inhibiting ice nucleation. Additionally, the utilization of low&#8208;concentration Zn(OAc)2 combined with high&#8208;concentration LiCl increases availability of free Cl&#8722; by mitigating strong ionic interaction in conventional ZnCl2&#8208;based concentrated electrolytes, thereby enhancing reaction kinetics of the I2/I+ conversion. Benefiting from synergistic manipulation of ionic interaction, water activity, and Cl&#8722; activity, the HC&#8208;SiO2 hydrogel achieves a high capacity of 490.9 mAh g&#8722;1 and durable lifespan exceeding 11,000 cycles at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C. These findings offer valuable insights for advancing practical low&#8208;temperature Zn&#8211;I2 batteries.

         <title>Transition from Tunneling to Schottky Barriers in Molecular Junctions Based on Polyoxometalate Monolayers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates molecular&#8208;scale Schottky diodes based on polyoxometalate (POM) nanoclusters, forming self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) on Au with EGaIn top&#8208;electrodes. POMs' high electron affinity and redox versatility enable Schottky&#8208;like barriers at the POM/EGaIn interface, achieving a rectification ratio&#160;&gt;&#160;3000. Temperature&#8208;dependent studies reveal a transition from direct tunneling to thermionic emission at&#160;&gt;1.0&#160;V bias.








Abstract
Schottky barriers are typically observed in mesoscale materials but are challenging to form at the molecular scale due to the discrete energy levels of molecules and the limited length of the transport channel, which hinder the development of an effective depletion region. In this study, we present the development of a molecular&#8208;scale Schottky diode within a monolayer junction by utilizing self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) of polyoxometalate (POM) nanoclusters. The high electron affinity and multiple redox states of POMs facilitate band bending at the molecule/EGaIn (Ga and In alloy) electrode interface, promoting the formation of a Schottky&#8208;like band structure. This molecular monolayer junction demonstrates an exceptional rectification ratio exceeding 3000, and temperature&#8208;dependent measurements reveal a transition in the charge transport mechanism from direct tunneling at low bias to thermionic emission at high bias. POM&#8208;based molecular junctions offer promising potential for molecular&#8208;scale Schottky devices, introducing novel mechanisms for high&#8208;performance molecular diodes. With their low power consumption, molecular diversity, and potential for integration into nanoscale circuits, molecular Schottky diodes are well&#8208;positioned to become key components in functional molecular devices.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Ketenimine Intermediates as Active Catalysts in the Michael Addition of Unactivated Nitriles to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PCNHCP Manganese hydride complex [(PCNHCP)Mn(CO)2H] (1) is able to reversibly activate unactivated nitriles. The resulting manganese&#8208;ketenimine complexes have proven to be competent catalysts for the Michael addition of unactivated nitriles (e.g., acetonitrile, propionitrile, and butyronitrile) to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. The reaction occurs under mild conditions, exhibits a wide substrate scope, and is easily scalable.







Abstract
The Michael addition of unactivated nitriles to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones is a challenging yet desirable strategy for installing alkyl cyano&#8208;groups (R&#8208;CN) in organic molecules. However, despite formidable efforts, using acetonitrile as a Michael donor in these reactions has remained a significant challenge. Herein, we report a highly active manganese(I) complex [(PCNHCP)Mn(CO)2H] (1), which chemoselectively catalyzes the 1,4&#8208;addition of unactivated nitriles (incl. acetonitrile) to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. The developed methodology operates under mild conditions, does not require any additives or bases, features low catalyst loadings (1&#8197;mol&#8201;%), fast reaction times (2&#8211;8&#8197;hours), and is compatible with a wide variety of functional groups, including halides, trifluoromethyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, and (hetero)aryl groups. Extensive mechanistic studies revealed that after base&#8208;free activation of the nitrile, either the N&#8208;bound manganese&#8208;ketenimine (propionitrile or benzyl cyanide) or the C&#8208;bound manganese&#8208;cyanoalkyl (acetonitrile) complex is formed. The difference in stability of these two species explains why more sterically hindered and presumably less activated nitriles (i.e., propionitrile, and butyronitrile) show higher reactivity than their corresponding more activated congeners (i.e., acetonitrile). Finally, the practicality of our approach was demonstrated through a gram&#8208;scale reaction and subsequent derivatizations of the obtained product into important organic motifs such as ene&#8208;lactams and tetrahydropyridines.

         <title>Cascaded Metalation of Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting Electrochemical CO Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon monoxide reduction reaction (CORR) to yield value&#8208;added methanol entails the delicate design of catalysts due to the large overpotential of this reaction. Especially, achieving precise modification of electrocatalysts while preserving the periodic alignment of active sites to optimize performance remains a significant challenge. Here, we report the cascaded metalation of phthalocyanine&#8208;based COFs for selective reduction of CO to methanol. After implanting the secondary metal (Ni), CityU&#8208;35 achieves a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 48.4% at &#8208;0.85 V vs. RHE, surpassing that of CityU&#8208;34 (2.1%) with only Co atoms. The enhanced methanol production originates from the optimization of electronic structure with improved *CO adsorption, which is substantiated by the spectroscopic shift in UV and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and a stronger *CO signal in the in&#8208;situ attenuated total reflectance surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS). Theoretical calculations have demonstrated that the cascaded metalation with the introduction of secondary Ni sites in CityU&#8208;35 not only improves the adsorption towards *CO intermediates but also supplies a fast generation of protons for the hydrogenation of *CO towards CH3OH. The optimized electronic structures with synergistic effects between Co and Ni sites after cascaded metalation reduce the energy barriers and improve the overall electroactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>A Triatomic Cobalt Catalyst for Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The advancement of rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries significantly depends on bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts to provide outstanding oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) performance. However, it is still challenging to design electrocatalysts with excellent bifunctional activity and stability. Here, we adopt an ultrafast printing method to efficiently embed a tri&#8208;atom cobalt complex precursor onto graphene nanosheets to obtain a triatomic catalyst (Co3&#8208;NG), exhibiting a durable and excellent bifunctional catalyst in the electrocatalytic ORR (Ehalf&#8208;wave &#8201;=&#8201; 0.903&#8201;V)and OER (Ej=10&#8201; = &#8201;1.596&#8201;V). The Co3&#8208;NG&#8208;assembled zinc&#8208;air battery can output a maximum power density of 189.0 mW cm&#8722;2 at 330 mA cm&#8722;2 and can be charged and discharged over 3,000 cycles significantly outperforming the Pt/C+RuO2 benchmark (146.5 mW cm&#8722;2, 360 cycles) under testing conditions of 25 &#176;C. In situ XAS analysis and theoretical calculations unclose that Co3ON6 is the catalytic site for bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysis. The constructed triangular pyramidal active sites effectively regulate the d&#8208;band center and electronic configuration, and promote the adsorption/desorption of oxygen intermediates. This work uncovers that the geometry and electronic structure of triatomic active center play a key role in improving bifunctional ORR/OER performance for electrochemical energy applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Sustainable and Scalable Approach for In&#8208;Situ Induction of Gradient Nucleation Sites in Biomass&#8208;Derived Interface Layers for Ultra&#8208;Stable Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc metal batteries are promising candidates for large&#8208;grid energy storage due to their safety, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and durability. However, challenges like dendrite growth, corrosion, and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on the zinc anode hinder their performance. Herein, we propose a sustainable and scalable approach to form a copper gluconate@carboxymethyl chitosan@kaolin (CuCK) interface layer, inducing gradient nucleation sites via in&#8208;situ galvanic and galvanostatic processes. The biomass&#8208;based CuCK coating features a gradient CuxZny alloy structure that homogenizes interfacial electric field distribution and enhances electrochemical stability. Furthermore, the incorporated Cu2+&#8208;loaded kaolin and carboxymethyl chitosan regulate Zn2+ flux, accelerate Zn2+ desolvation, and suppress HER. The resulting Zn@CuCK anode achieves a high cumulative capacity of 5500 mAh cm&#8722;2 in symmetrical cells, exhibits excellent durability in Zn@CuCK//NaV3O8&#183;1.5H2O full cells across a wide temperature range (&#8722;30 to 60 &#176;C), and endows the assembly of pouch cells with high energy density.</dc:description>

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Tandem Catalysis for Plastic Depolymerization: In Situ Hydrogen Generation via Methanol APR for Sustainable PE Hydrogenolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyethylene waste undergoes hydrogenolysis using in situ hydrogen from methanol aqueous phase reforming (APR) over a Ru&#8211;Pt/TiO2 catalyst, achieving 85.1% conversion with 81.0% selectivity for liquid fuels and lubricants. Pt enhances APR&#8208;driven H2 generation, while Ru facilitates C&#9472;C cleavage in polyethylene. Isotope labeling confirms methanol&#8208;derived hydrogen utilization. This approach provides a sustainable alternative to fossil&#8208;derived hydrogen, as reported by Insoo Ro et&#160;al. in their Communication (e202420748).

         <title>Molecular Stiffening by Macrocycle Clustering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allosteric stiffening of a portion of a protein surface is a strategy used in nature to regulate protein oligomerization and provide crucial functions for cells. However, a similar strategy to selectively control part of a compound dynamics remains elusive. Here we show that cucurbit[n]uril (CB[n]) macrocycles can bind almost all portions of a tetratopic guest molecule, stiffening the different parts of the guest to different extents. &#8220;Host&#8208;guest&#8221; interactions were found to be instrumental in selectively &#8220;freezing&#8221; guest molecular motions. The combination of 1H&#8208;NMR (1D, 2D), DOSY, VT&#8208;NMR, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), mass spectrometry and molecular modelling enabled to highlight the crucial role of cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) binding in the selective hardening of relevant portions of the guest molecule. Beyond implications for bioinspired systems mimicking control of a system dynamic to create a new function, this approach has relevance for improving room temperature phosphorescence, and could also be used to allosterically control organocatalysis in water.</dc:description>

         <title>Nuclear&#8208;Targeted Material Enabled Intranuclear MicroRNA Imaging for Tracking Gene Editing Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gene editing technology based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/associated protein (CRISPR/Cas) systems serves as an efficient tool in cancer therapy. Tracking the gene editing process can help identify the progress of cancer treatment. However, existing techniques for monitoring the gene editing process rely on lysed cells, which can not reflect the dynamic changes of nucleic acid in living cells. It urgently needs in&#8208;situ and real&#8208;time imaging technologies to track gene editing process at living single cell level more effectively and precisely. Here, we reported a highly efficient nuclear&#8208;targeted material, phenylboronic acid modified linear PEI (LPBA), for loading gene editing plasmids and fluorescent probes to track gene editing processes of microRNA. Based on LPBA, we achieved efficient intranuclear microRNA imaging at the living cell level, reaching 32.4&#8208;fold higher than linear PEI (LPEI) delivery system, which facilitated further sensitive monitoring of the gene editing process both in living cells and in vivo. Meanwhile, this efficient gene&#8208;editing and real&#8208;time detection technique could be extended to screening effective gene editing plasmids. Such LPBA&#8208;based imaging technology extended imaging area of microRNA and offered new insight in the field of gene editing and nucleic acid detection.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Electron Acceptors Containing Transition Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel molecular platform characteristic of multiple transition metals (CH&#8208;Zn, CH&#8208;Ni, CH&#8208;Pt) on conjugated backbones, is firstly established as high&#8208;performance electron acceptors. The CH&#8208;Pt&#8208;based ternary organic photovoltaics render an excellent power conversion efficiency surpassing 20%, more importantly, the unexplored dependency of central metals on intrinsic physicochemical properties of acceptors, nanoscale morphologies of donor/acceptor blends and final photovoltaic outcomes is fully disclosed. By demonstrating such a rare case of metal&#8208;containing acceptor, our work provides insight into whether metal complexes can serve as the building blocks of high&#8208;performance acceptors and gives guidance to rational design of metal&#8208;containing acceptors.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative Redox Reactions Encoded by Two Gene Clusters Enable Intermolecular Cycloaddition Cascade for the Formation of Meroaspochalasins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Meroaspochalasins (mAPOs) are a group of intricate heteromers comprising two distinct subunits, dienophile aspochalasin and diene isobenzofuran, of which the biosynthetic mechanism is of great interest yet unrevealed. In this study, two independent biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), flas and epi, being responsible for the biosynthesis of aspochalasin B (7) and pre&#8208;diene hemiacetal 21 (or 26), respectively, were identified in the filamentous fungus Aspergillusflavipes. In vivo and in vitro studies proved that a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)&#8208;dependent oxidase FlasF in the flas cluster catalyzes the crucial oxidation to generate diverse aspochalasin monomers, particularly the dienophile 7. Interactive reduction catalyzed by the short&#8208;chain alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) FlasG and endogenous NADPH further increases the complexity of this anabolic network. The cytochrome P450 enzyme EpiC and SDR enzyme EpiD in the epi cluster collaboratively catalyze the formation of pre&#8208;diene 21 (or 26), which can spontaneously dehydrate to yield a diene, leading to the non&#8208;enzymatic cascade of [4&#960; + 2&#960;] Diels&#8208;Alder and formal [5&#960; + 2&#960;] cycloaddition reaction to generate mAPO dimers and trimer progressively. Moreover, the FAD&#8208;dependent oxidase EpiG catalyzes the hydroxylation at the C3 position of the diene as a critical step in the formation of mAPO trimers.</dc:description>

         <title>Cl3Al&#8208;PH3 is a Weak Lewis Pair Allowing the Synthesis of Sterically Highly Hindered Primary and Secondary Alkyl Phosphanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphane (PH3) gas has the highest phosphorus content of all commercial phosphorus compounds, yet its use for valuable chemicals is very limited. Aluminum chloride and phosphane yield quantitatively the adduct Cl3Al&#8208;PH3, which is easy to handle and reacts with a large set of alkyl halides to give phosphonium salts that can be converted to primary phosphanes. This sequence has been generalized to access various secondary and tertiary phosphanes in excellent yields under mild conditions and short reaction times. With unprecedented ease, these reactions allow in particular, the preparation of sterically demanding phosphanes, which, as ligands, are key components of highly catalytically competent transition metal complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing Collaborative Effects of Binary Additives on Regulating Precursor Crystallization toward Highly Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fabricating high&#8208;quality perovskite layers with large grains and low defect density is essential for achieving high&#8208;performance solar cells. Considering the significant advancements made in additive engineering for optimizing perovskite crystallization using single additive, exploring the collaborative effect of dual additives on precursor for perovskite crystallization may be an effective way for further advancing device performance. Herein, a binary additives strategy is proposed, where PMAI and 2PACz are introduced into the precursor. Compared with the precursor with no additives or a single additive, the use of dual additives more effectively cleaves edge&#8208;shared Pb&#8208;I octahedra to expedite the transformation from PbI2 to PbI3&#8208; complexes as prenucleation clusters, and produces much larger colloidal particles with accelerated nucleation. Concurrently, the crystallization in both spin&#8208;coating and annealing processes is significantly retarded due to the stronger interaction between perovskite and binary additives with more functional groups. Benefiting from such rapid nucleation and slow crystallization, high&#8208;quality perovskite layer with larger&#8208;sized crystals and fewer defects is formed, resulting in mitigated micro&#8208;strain, enhanced charge extraction, and suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination. Consequently, the device with dual additives could achieve an impressive efficiency of 26.05% (certified 25.49%) and retained 90% of its initial efficiency after 1200 hours of maximum power point tracking.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer lipids (PLs) are essential components of liposomes and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for drug and gene delivery, providing colloidal stabilization and defining the biological interface. While poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)&#8208;based PLs are the current standard, they are suspected to be responsible for rare adverse reactions, e. g. to LNP&#8208;based Covid&#8208;19 vaccines. Therefore, PLs based on alternative stealth polymers are being intensively investigated for their use in LNPs. However, alternative PLs often lack comparability due to different synthesis protocols and are often not easily accessible. Herein we present a catalyst&#8208;free, efficient and versatile coupling procedure for PL synthesis based on azide&#8208;functionalized polymers and electron&#8208;deficient acetylene dicarboxylate lipids. To highlight the versatility of this approach, we prepared PLs based on PEG and 4 alternative stealth polymers with quantitative coupling efficiencies. The linker structure showed appropriate pH stability and biocompatibility. All PLs enabled the preparation of well&#8208;defined liposomes with excellent stability. Our facile and versatile approach yields comparable PLs with minimized linker size, making them promising candidates for future comparative studies and biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron&#8208;deficient Cobalt Centers Realized by Rational p&#8208;&#960; Conjugation Regulation

         <dc:description>Rational design of the coordination environment of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) can enhance their catalytic activity, which is of great significance for high&#8208;loading and lean&#8208;electrolyte lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. Inspired by the Lewis acid&#8208;base theory, we design a unique coordination environment for constructing electron&#8208;deficient Co SACs on carbon nanotubes (named as CNT@f&#8208;CoNC), which function as a Lewis acid, to enhance the chemisorption and catalytic activity towards polysulfides (Lewis base). Compared with porphyrin&#8208;like Co SACs, electron&#8208;deficient Co SACs (Lewis acid) exhibit much stronger binding affinity towards polysulfides (Lewis base) and significantly lower energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step in the sulfur reduction reaction. As expected, even with a high sulfur loading (6.9 mg cm&#8722;2) and lean electrolyte to sulfur (E/S) ratio (4.0 &#956;L mg&#8722;1), the areal capacity still reaches 7.7 mAh cm&#8722;2. Moreover, a 1.6 Ah&#8208;class pouch cell is successfully assembled under the harsh conditions and delivers an energy density of 422 Wh kg&#8722;1. This work provides novel insights into enhancing the electrochemical performance of Li&#8208;S batteries by modulating the local electronic density of metal sites through the rational design of the coordination environment.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering an Excellent &#946;&#8208;BaB2O4&#8208;Inspired UV Nonlinear Optical Material Through Secondary Building Unit Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel &#946;&#8208;BBO&#8208;like compound, Li3[Be3(OH)3(C3H2O4)3]&#183;7H2O (LBOC), has been successfully designed through the substitution of secondary building units (SBUs). Thanks to the thoughtfully engineered [Be3(OH)3(C3H2O4)3]3&#8722; SBU, LBOC not only inherits the strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response characteristic of &#946;&#8208;BBO but also effectively mitigates its excessive birefringence. Additionally, it features a short UV cut&#8208;off edge at 200&#160;nm. Importantly, its favorable growth habit underscores its potential as a promising UV nonlinear optical (NLO) crystal.








Abstract
The development of nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals with tailored properties has been a long&#8208;standing pursuit, yet remains challenging to achieve. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of a novel high&#8208;performance UV NLO material, Li3[Be3(OH)3(C3H2O4)3]&#183;7H2O (LBOC), by substituting the [B3O6] functional building units (FBUs) in the classic &#946;&#8208;BaB2O4 (&#946;&#8208;BBO) with meticulously designed [Be3(OH)3(C3H2O4)3]3&#8722; secondary building units (SBUs). The [Be3(OH)3(C3H2O4)3]3&#8722; SBUs within LBOC preserve the ordered arrangement of the [B3O6] FBUs found in &#946;&#8208;BBO, enabling LBOC to inherit the strong second harmonic generation (SHG) response from &#946;&#8208;BBO. Additionally, the increased dimensionality of the [Be3(OH)3(C3H2O4)3]3&#8722; SBUs, compared to the planar [B3O6] FBUs, leads to a reduction in optical anisotropy. Consequently, LBOC demonstrates a moderate birefringence of 0.067@589.3&#160;nm, lower than that of &#946;&#8208;BBO (0.118@589.3&#160;nm). Notably, bulk crystals of LBOC can be easily grown using a straightforward solution evaporation method, making it a promising candidate for UV NLO applications. This strategic design of the SBU opens new avenues for the rational development of NLO crystals with tailored properties.

         <title>Direct Quantification of Neuroprotective Effect of Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst on Neurochemical Transmission by Multi&#8208;Spatiotemporal Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neuroprotective effects of single&#8208;atom catalysts on neurochemical transmission have been quantified by multi&#8208;spatiotemporal electrochemistry including in vivo analysis and single&#8208;cell amperometry (SCA). This study uncovers the molecular mechanism underlying neuroprotection of single&#8208;atom nanozyme at multiple levels, offering new insights into therapeutic strategies of restoring dopamine release for brain disorders and injuries.








Abstract
Maintaining redox homeostasis through biocatalytic reactions has emerged as a widely studied neuroprotective strategy for various brain disorders and injuries. However, current research on neuroprotection primarily focuses on functional and behavioral assessments. The impact of neuroprotective interventions on neurotransmission, a critical function of the central nervous system (CNS), remains relatively underexplored. In this study, we report the first direct evidence for neuroprotective effect on neurochemical transmission by multi&#8208;spatiotemporal electrochemistry. We employed in vivo and single&#8208;vesicle electrochemistry to quantitatively evaluate the neuroprotective effect of an antioxidative Fe single&#8208;atom nanozyme (Fe1/NC SAzyme) on neurotransmission, using a 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;phenylpyridinium (MPP+)&#8208;induced Parkinson's disease (PD) model. In the PD animal model, Fe1/NC SAzyme mitigates MPP+ neurotoxicity by decreasing damage to dopaminergic neurons, increasing evoked dopamine release, attenuating spontaneous firing, and alleviating locomotor impairment. At the single&#8208;cell level, pretreatment with Fe1/NC SAzyme inhibits MPP+ effects by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), increasing cell viability and ATP concentration, and enhancing the exocytotic release. This study not only provides a research paradigm for directly quantifying therapeutic mechanisms of brain disorders and injury but also reinforces a novel neuroprotective strategy through modulating the redox homeostasis with biocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Tuning Ru&#8211;O Coordination for Switching Redox Centers in Acidic Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By precisely controlling the Ru&#8211;O coordination number, the dominant acidic OER mechanism in RuOx&#8208;based catalysts is switched from the detrimental lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) to the more favorable oxide path mechanism (OPM), achieving both high activity and robust stability. Our findings reveal that Ru2&#8211;O11 moieties enable selective redox switching, while Ru2&#8211;O9 and Ru2&#8211;O8 moieties either activate both LOM and OPM or bypass them entirely.








Abstract
Avoiding lattice oxygen involvement (oxygen redox) while promoting the coupling of adjacent adsorbed oxygen (metal redox) during the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential for gaining high activity and robust stability in RuO2&#8208;based catalysts but remains elusive. Here, we present a precise strategy to selectively activate the metal redox process while suppressing the undesired oxygen redox pathway by fine&#8208;tuning the Ru&#8211;O coordination number in amorphous RuOx. The optimized catalyst exhibits outstanding acidic OER performance, achieving a low overpotential of 215&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and maintaining stability for 300 h with a negligible degradation rate of 100 &#181;V h&#8722;1. X&#8208;ray absorption measurements and multiple operando spectra reveal that only Ru2&#8211;O11 moieties can selectively activate the metal redox process, whereas Ru2&#8211;O9 and Ru2&#8211;O8 moieties either trigger both redox pathways or bypass them. Theoretical calculations reveal that Ru2&#8211;O11 moiety reduces crystal field splitting energy at active Ru sites, disables lattice oxygen activation, and lowers the energy barrier for oxygen coupling. The strategy developed in this work offers new avenues for switching redox centers and refining OER mechanisms to enhance catalytic performance and long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>Engineered Probiotics Enable Targeted Gut Delivery of Dual Gasotransmitters for Inflammatory Bowel Disease Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We engineer Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) with CO/H2S&#8208;releasing copolymers, enabling targeted and controlled CO/H2S release at inflamed sites. This strategy alleviates IBD by reducing inflammation, restoring gut barrier integrity, and promoting beneficial microbiota. Additionally, CO/H2S enhances neuroprotective metabolites, reducing neuroinflammation and anxiety&#8208;like behaviors, offering a novel therapeutic avenue.








Abstract
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains an incurable condition, often accompanied by high rates of anxiety and depression, further diminishing the quality of life of patients. Endogenous gasotransmitters, such as carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H&#8322;S), exhibit potent anti&#8208;inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. However, their therapeutic application is limited by challenges in targeted delivery to affected tissues. Here, we propose a novel strategy for targeted gut delivery of CO/H2S through engineering Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) with CO/H2S&#8208;releasing copolymer (POSR) loading. This engineered probiotic (POSR@EcN) enhances EcN colonization in the intestine and enables controlled, localized release of CO/H2S at inflamed sites. The release of CO/H2S modulates inflammation, restores intestinal barrier integrity, and reshapes gut microbiota by promoting beneficial bacteria and increasing short&#8208;chain fatty acids production, effectively alleviating IBD symptoms. Notably, targeted CO/H2S delivery also elevates neuroprotective metabolites like indoleacetic acid and &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid, reducing neuroinflammation via the gut&#8208;brain axis and mitigating anxiety&#8208; and depression&#8208;like behaviors in IBD mice. This approach highlights the potential of EcN as a probiotic carrier for the targeted delivery of gasotransmitters, offering a promising strategy for IBD treatment.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Responsive Immunomodulator Prodrugs Rejuvenating Immune Microenvironment for &#8220;Cold&#8221; Tumor Photoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;responsive immunomodulator prodrugs are constructed with imiquimod and boron dipyrromethene via a reactive oxygen species&#8208;cleavable linker for cancer phototherapy and immunotherapy. Under 808&#160;nm laser irradiation, the immunomodulator prodrug effectively reverses the &#8220;cold&#8221; tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment and inhibits primary and distant tumor progression, with excellent immune memory for suppressing spontaneous lung metastasis.








Abstract
Light&#8208;activatable prodrugs have been applied in precision cancer therapy because of their spatiotemporal controllability and minimal toxic side effects. However, the reported prodrugs were limited by the ultraviolet and visible light regions, which seriously restricted their application in deep tissues. Developing a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;activatable release system remains a great challenge. Herein, the 808&#160;nm light&#8208;activatable prodrugs were constructed with imiquimod (R837) and NIR boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) via a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;cleavable linker for photoimmunotherapy of &#8220;cold&#8221; cancer. ROS produced by BODIPY could cleave the linker under 808&#160;nm laser irradiation, and R837 was released spatiotemporally at the tumor site. The combination of the immune response produced by R837 and immunogenic cell death caused by phototherapy significantly potentiated adaptive antitumor immunity and enhanced cytotoxic CD8+ T cell infiltration for tumor metastasis and distant tumor inhibition. This work provides an effective NIR light&#8208;activatable controlled release system for cancer immunotherapy and metastasis suppression.

         <title>Electric&#8208;Dipole Coupling Ion&#8208;Dipole Engineering Induced Rational Solvation&#8208;Desolvation Behavior for Constructing Stable Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electric&#8208;dipole coupling ion&#8208;dipole engineering improves the solvation&#8208;desolvation behavior and enables rapid Li+ transfer kinetics in composite polymer electrolytes. The tailored solvation environment promotes the generation of inorganic&#8208;rich SEI/CEI and ensures the long&#8208;term cycling stability of solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) with high ionic conductivity, a wide voltage window, and an ultrastability electrolyte/electrode interface are essential for practical applications of solid lithium&#8208;metal batteries but particularly challenging. The key to overcoming these long&#8208;term obstacles lies in the rational design of the Li+ solvation&#8208;desolvation behavior in SPEs. Herein, we propose an electric&#8208;dipole coupling ion&#8208;dipole strategy to modulate the Li+ solvation structure and enhance Li+ desolvation kinetics. The experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate that the free solvents and FSI&#8722; are anchored by ion&#8211;dipole interactions, which facilitate the transfer of Li+ and obtain a wide electrochemical stability window. Coupling the electric&#8208;dipole interactions that promote lithium salt dissociation and rapid ion desolvation contributes to obtaining more mobile Li+ and realizing an inorganic&#8208;rich electrolyte/electrode interface. Benefiting from the above benefits, the assembled lithium symmetric cells and the full cells demonstrate ultralong cycling life. More importantly, full cells with high&#8208;loading cathodes (LiFePO4 with 11.25&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, NCM811 with 7.84&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) and pouch cell still display stable cycling. This research gives valuable insights into regulating the solvation&#8208;desolvation behavior in SPEs and facilitates the development of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li metal batteries.

         <title>Expanding the Spectral Range in T2&#8208;Supertetrahedral Nonlinear Optical Chalcogenides via Incorporating Inorganic Polycations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of the inorganic (Cl4K8Ba2)8+ salt cation instead of an organic ligand cation endowed [K4BaCl2][In6Se11] with a wide infrared transparency range (0.7&#8211;18.1&#160;&#181;m), which can be considered the finishing touch in advancing [K4BaCl2][In6Se11] as a viable IR NLO candidate.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;chalcogenide supertetrahedral clusters that exhibit significant hyperpolarizability are highly sought after as promising nonlinear optical (NLO) function modules. However, these &#8220;naked&#8221; anionic clusters are commonly coordinated with organic ligands to maintain electrical neutrality, which unfortunately limits their utility in the mid&#8208; and far&#8208;infrared (MFIR) region due to strong absorption. In this study, we successfully substituted the organic ligand with the unprecedented (X4K8Ba2)8+ supertetrahedral cations, which are suitable size and high charge, and integrated them with (In4Se10)8&#8722; supertetrahedral clusters to form 3D salt&#8208;inclusion chalcogenides (SICs), [K4BaX2][In6Se11] (X&#160;=&#160;Cl 1,&#160;Br 2). As anticipated, the parallel arrangement of the (In4Se10)8&#8722; clusters yielded splendid second&#8208;harmonic generation intensities (2.2&#8211;2.4&#160;&#215;&#160;benchmark AgGaS2 @1910&#160;nm for 1 and 2, respectively), ranking among the top within the SICs category. Most importantly, the introduction of inorganic polycations with a broad cut&#8208;off IR edge is a key factor in enabling 1 to achieve an ultrawide transparency range (0.7 to 18.1&#160;&#181;m) that covers the crucial atmospheric windows (3&#8211;5 and 8&#8211;14&#160;&#181;m). Indeed, replacing the organic ligand with an inorganic polycation allows supertetrahedra&#8208;based chalcogenides to fulfill the broad&#8208;spectrum criteria of NLO materials.

         <title>Intercalation of Transition&#8208;Metal Complexes into 2D Hybrid Perovskites for Tailored Dual&#8208;Band Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intercalation of transition&#8208;metal complexes into 2D hybrid lead&#8208;bromide perovskites is presented, enabling tailored dual&#8208;band emission. The material features distinct intralayer and interlayer photoluminescence pathways with tunable optical properties, showcasing its potential in advanced optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
The recently emerging two&#8208;dimensional (2D) hybrid lead&#8208;halide perovskites are mostly templated by &#8220;inert&#8221; organic cations, limiting their light emission solely from the inorganic components. Using &#8220;optically active&#8221; organic cations can grant access to the coupling between the two luminescent components, potentially leading to new excitation and emission pathways. However, employing optically active organic cations requires delicate design and complicated synthesis. To circumvent these problems, transition&#8208;metal complexes (e.g., Cu2+ and Ni2+) were intercalated in 2D perovskites and reported, for the first time, the photoluminescence (PL) profiles. 2D perovskites incorporating transition&#8208;metal complexes can be considered a molecular &#8220;type II&#8221; heterostructure where the &#8220;conduction band&#8221; is localized on the complexes and the &#8220;valence band&#8221; on the haloplumbate layers. As evident in the absorption and PL spectra of the materials, the &#8220;type II&#8221; configuration allows inter&#8208;band transitions to occur in addition to intraband within 2D Pb&#9472;Br layers. This makes the material's PL excitation wavelength dependent, allowing activation of only inter&#8208;band or inter&#8208;band plus intraband transitions by certain wavelengths. As the transition&#8208;metal complexes are highly tunable, this extra variable renders 2D hybrid perovskites a fertile playground for PL engineering as desired outcome can be targeted through fine&#8208;tailoring of inorganic lattice structures and selection of complexes with specific electronic configuration.

         <title>A Site&#8208;Specific Photo&#8208;Crosslinking Proteomics Approach Provides Insights into Noncanonical Pyroptotic Caspase&#8208;4 Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Caspase&#8208;4 plays critical roles in mediating noncanonical pyroptosis. We employed a site&#8208;specific photo&#8208;crosslinking proteomics approach to profile caspase&#8208;4 substrates. Among the newly identified substrates, caspase&#8208;5/12 and an important kinase, AKT1, were validated to be cleaved into their active forms. Our findings provide insights into the pathways that interact with the pyroptosis pathway.








Abstract
Inflammatory caspases (1/4/5) are key effectors in the process of pyroptosis by cleaving and activating the pore&#8208;forming protein gasdermin D (GSDMD). Unlike other caspases whose substrates have been well characterized, the substrates for caspase&#8208;4, which mediate noncanonical pyroptosis, remain poorly understood. Here, we combined noncanonical amino acids, photo&#8208;crosslinking, and proteomics to profile caspase&#8208;4 substrates, enabling the capture of transient protein interactions with activated caspase&#8208;4. A set of new substrates were identified by photo&#8208;crosslinking mass spectrometry, revealing the signaling pathway and biological process affected by pyroptosis. Notably, we found that AKT1 is cleaved at D108, which removes its autoinhibition and membrane localization domain, resulting in the release of activated AKT1. Our results also showed the precursor of caspase&#8208;5/12 could be cleaved by caspase&#8208;4 to form the p20/p10 active conformation, uncovering a previously unrecognized pyroptotic caspase cascade. Overall, this study presents an approach for identifying caspase&#8208;4 substrates and offers further understanding of noncanonical pyroptosis.

         <title>A Titanium Silicalite&#8208;1 (TS&#8208;1) Catalyst with Abundant Active Ti&#8208;VI Species for Efficient Conversion of Ethylene to Glycol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective dual&#8208;alkali post&#8208;treatment strategy for preparing the bifunctional TS&#8208;1 catalyst involving highly active TiO4&#160;+&#160;Ti&#8208;VI species and enhanced diffusion properties was explored through the clear understanding of Ti species transformation law. The resulting catalyst exhibits an outstanding activity for ethylene to glycol, achieving 98.6&#160;% conversion of H2O2 and 99.8&#160;% selectivity of EG, which is &#8776;2 times of the conventional TS&#8208;1.








Abstract
One&#8208;pot synthesis of glycol from ethylene and H2O2 is simple and environmentally friendly, making it a potential alternative for glycol production. The key to the success of this is to have a bifunctional catalyst with both oxidative activity for ethylene epoxidation and acidic centers for the hydration of ethylene oxide. Typically, the incorporation of trivalent metal ions into titanium silicalite&#8208;1 (TS&#8208;1) framework can provide the two types of active centers, but this often results in decreased oxidative activity. Here, we propose a dual&#8208;chemical post&#8208;treatment regime to introduce acid centers in TS&#8208;1 while simultaneously improving oxidative activity. The combined tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH)&#160;+&#160;(NH4)2CO3 post&#8208;treatment not only produces abundant Ti(OSi)2(OH)4 (Ti&#8208;VI) species from Ti(OSi)4, but also creates internal cavities within TS&#8208;1. Ti&#8208;VI possesses both high oxidative activity and acidic sites. The presence of internal cavities enhances the diffusion on the catalyst as well as increases the accessibility of Ti&#8208;VI species. Consequently, when applied as a catalyst, the combined&#8208;treated TS&#8208;1 demonstrates an outstanding catalytic performance, achieving 98.6&#160;% conversion of H2O2 and 99.8&#160;% selectivity of EG, which is &#8776;2 times of the conventional TS&#8208;1. This study also unveils the formation mechanism of Ti&#8208;VI during the post&#8208;treatment.

         <title>Simple Boron&#8211;Nitrogen Covalent Bond Constructs Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emitters: Ultra&#8208;Narrowband Deep&#8208;Blue Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging a &#960;&#8208;extended BN&#8208;bond framework, we developed a deep&#8208;blue MR&#8208;TADF emitter using a lithium&#8208;free, amine&#8208;directed borylation strategy. The emitter exhibits an ultra&#8208;narrow emission band (FWHM = 13&#160;nm) and efficient reverse intersystem crossing, consequently affording a maximum external quantum efficiency of nearly 30% at CIE coordinates of (0.155, 0.060) in the device.








Abstract
High&#8208;efficiency, pure deep&#8208;blue emitters are critically needed to meet the rising demands of ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition displays. Although high&#8208;order B/N&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) leveraging multi&#8208;resonance (MR) effects show promise, their complex syntheses and large molecular weights hinder practical application. Here, we report a compact MR framework featuring three nitrogen&#8208;linked boron centers, synthesized at the gram scale via a single&#8208;step, amine&#8208;directed borylation. This emitter displays deep&#8208;blue emission with an ultra&#8208;narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 13&#160;nm and achieves an order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude increase in the reverse intersystem crossing rate constant (kRISC) compared to previous BN&#8208;bond&#8208;based blue MR emitters. Theoretical studies reveal that its &#960;&#8208;extended framework and partially distorted geometry synergistically minimize structural relaxation to reduce FWHM and enhance spin&#8211;orbit coupling to facilitate efficient spin&#8208;flip processes. As a result, the corresponding deep&#8208;blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibit an FWHM of 15&#160;nm and a high maximum external quantum efficiency (&#951;EQE,max) approaching 30% at color coordinates of (0.155, 0.060), rivaling the leading performance of deep&#8208;blue OLEDs based on conventional B/N&#8208;doped frameworks.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of a Self&#8208;Sustaining Modular Afterglow Scaffold for In Vivo Activatable Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) derivative (i.e., BDI) is molecularly tailored with iodine substitution for 1O2 generation and prolonged ethylene bonds to increase 1O2 reactivity, enabling a self&#8208;sustaining afterglow initiator, substrate, and relay unit simultaneously. By introducing a biomarker&#8208;responsive unit on the N,N&#8208;dimethylaniline group, activatable afterglow probes can be fabricated for sensitive and precise imaging of biomarker&#8208;related diseases.








Abstract
Self&#8208;sustaining afterglow molecules (SAMs) offer high simplicity, reproducibility, and design flexibility compared to common multicomponent systems. To date, only a few SAMs have been reported. However, these studies mainly focus on probe selection and screening, without providing the guidance for constructing SAMs from the bottom up. Herein, we report the molecular design and tuning of a boron dipyrromethene derivative (BDI), with structural engineering to enhance the singlet oxygen (1O2) reactivity and photosensitivity, aiming to construct SAMs for activatable afterglow imaging. The optimized BDI is customized into water&#8208;soluble nanoparticles (i.e., BDI&#8208;NPs) aided by an amphiphilic polymer, achieving all&#8208;in&#8208;one afterglow luminescence with a peak at 780&#160;nm. An activatable afterglow probe (i.e., BDIS&#8208;NPs) is fabricated, which can simultaneously activate fluorescence and afterglow signals in the presence of hydrogen disulfide (H2S). Owing to the elimination of autofluorescence and high activation contrast of the afterglow signal, BDIS&#8208;NPs enables early monitoring of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#8208;induced acute lung injury within 15&#160;min and sensitive visualization of H2S accumulation in the brain of schizophrenia mice with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR), which is not achievable by fluorescence imaging. This study provides an in&#8208;depth understanding and design guidelines for SAMs and activatable afterglow imaging.

         <title>La3+ Doped Nickel&#8208;Manganese Oxide as High&#8208;Capacity Cathode for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries Guided by Bayesian Optimization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The La3+ doped O3&#8208;NaNi0.39Mn0.5Cu0.06La0.05O2 cathode material has been successfully prepared guided by Bayesian optimization, which can realize the O3&#8208;P3&#8208;OP2 phase transition to induce negative lattice expansion during cycling. Besides, it delivers an excellent specific capacity attributed to the fact that La3+ doping can achieve the anionic redox during charge.







Abstract
In sodium&#8208;ion batteries, the layered transition metal oxides used as cathode often experience interlayer sliding of interlayer spacing and lattice variations during charge/discharge, leading to structural damage and capacity degradation. To address this challenge, a La3+ doping strategy guided by Bayesian optimization has been employed to prepare the high&#8208;performance O3&#8208;NaNi0.39Mn0.50Cu0.06La0.05O2 (NMCL) cathode material. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the O&#160;2p orbital overlaps with the t2g orbital of transition metals in NMCL, facilitating the formation of Na&#8722;O&#8722;La bonds and promoting the oxygen redox reaction kinetics. During the Na+ (de)intercalation process, NMCL exhibits significant negative lattice expansion, characterized by an increase in the c lattice parameter and exceptionally low volume expansion of 1.8&#8201;% and 3.1&#8201;%, respectively. Consequently, it delivers an excellent specific capacity of 243.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 over a wide voltage range of 2.0&#8197;V to 4.5&#8197;V, which can be attributed to La3+ doping that promotes oxidation of O2&#8722; to peroxide O2n&#8722; (n&lt;2) during charge.

         <title>Improving Photocatalytic Hydrogen Generation via Polycitric Acid&#8208;based Carbon Nanodots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence, that polycitric acid&#8208;based carbon nanodot (CND) can pose on the properties of incorporated N&#8208;hetero&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated chromophores was investigated. Phenazine was used as the probe chromophore, because of its well&#8208;understood redox chemistry. Striking differences in spectral and electrochemical properties upon reduction between phenazine incorporated within CND (P&#8208;CND) and free phenazine were observed.







Abstract
Bottom&#8208;up syntheses of carbon nanodots (CND) using solvothermal treatment of citric acid are known to afford nanometer&#8208;sized, amorphous polycitric acid&#8208;based materials. The addition of suitable co&#8208;reactants in the form of in situ synthesized N&#8208;hetero&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated chromophores facilitates hereby the overall functionalization. Reports regarding the influence of CND on the properties of, for example, N&#8208;hetero&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated chromophores are scarce. Thus, our incentive was to design a CND model that features phenazine (P&#8208;CND) &#8211; a well&#8208;known N&#8208;hetero&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated chromophore &#8211; to investigate the influence of the CND matrix on its redox chemistry as well as photochemistry. The scope of our work was to go beyond investigating the electrochemical properties of the resulting P&#8208;CND by shedding light onto differences relative to nano&#8208;aggregates of phenazine (PNZNA), which served as reference. In particular, chemical as well as electrochemical reduction of PNZNA initiated a reaction cascade that affords the primary reduction intermediate, that is, the reduced and protonated (PNZ&#8208;H)&#8901;. In accordance with existing literature, the final product of a bimolecular disproportionation was 5,10&#8208;dihydrophenazine (PNZ&#8208;H2). Reducing P&#8208;CND also resulted in the formation of (PNZ&#8208;H)&#8901;. But, no evidence for a subsequent bimolecular disproportionation was gathered. Instead, (PNZ&#8208;H)&#8901; as an integrative part of P&#8208;CND was found to be actively involved in a H2 generation reaction. A more than twofold increase in efficiency compared to PNZNA under identical conditions was the consequence.

         <title>Conduction Band and Defect Engineering for the Prominent Visible&#8208;Light Responsive Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling the stacking structure of the cationic 2D sheets enables the formation of the defect&#8208;tolerant bonding&#8208;based conduction band minimum (CBM). The key is in the hybridization of empty Bi&#8208;6pz orbitals via the interlayer interaction of [Bi2O2]2+ slabs in Bi4NbO8Cl. Such a CBM is almost unaffected by anion vacancies, preventing the deep trapping of photogenerated electrons and maintaining them in reactive states. This property contributes significantly to enhancing the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of Bi4NbO8Cl by keeping photogenerated electrons available for surface reactions.







Abstract
Controlling trap depth is crucial to improve photocatalytic activity, but designing such crystal structures has been challenging. In this study, we discovered that in 2D materials like BiOCl and Bi4NbO8Cl, composed of interleaved [Bi2O2]2+ and Cl&#8208; slabs, the trap depth can be controlled by manipulating the slab stacking structure. In BiOCl, oxygen vacancies (VO) create deep electron traps, while chlorine vacancies (VCl) produce shallow traps. The depth is determined by the coordination around anion vacancies: VO forms strong &#963; bonds with Bi&#8208;6p dangling bonds below the conduction band minimum (CBM), while those around Cl are parallel, forming weak &#960;&#8208;bonding. The strong re&#8208;hybridization makes the trap depth deeper. In Bi4NbO8Cl, VCl also creates shallow traps, but VO does not produce deep traps although Bi&#8208;6p orbitals are also forming strong &#963; bonding. This difference is attributed to the difference of the energy level of CBM. In both cases, the CBM consists of Bi&#8208;6p orbitals extending into the Cl layers. However, these orbitals are isolated in BiOCl, but those in Bi4NbO8Cl are bonded with each other between neighboring [Bi2O2]2+ layers. This unique bonding&#8208;based CBM prevents the formation of deep electron traps, and significantly enhances H2 evolution activity by prolonging the lifetime of highly reactive free electrons.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Water Splitting in Isoindigo&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, two isoindigo&#8208;functionalized covalent organic frameworks (I&#8208;TTA and I&#8208;TG) were synthesized using a microwave&#8208;assisted method. By modulating core planarity, distinct morphological variations were achieved, with the highly crystalline, planar sheet&#8208;like I&#8208;TTA material standing out. This material exhibits exceptional electrocatalytic performance for water splitting (OER and HER) reactions with low overpotential and promotes the potential of COFs in sustainable energy applications.







Abstract
Developing a low&#8208;cost, robust, and high&#8208;performance electrocatalyst capable of efficiently performing both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under both basic and acidic conditions is a major challenge. This area of research has attracted much attention in recent decades due to its importance in energy storage and conversion. Herein, we report the synthesis of two imine&#8208;linked isoindigo&#8208;based covalent organic networks I&#8208;TTA and I&#8208;TG (I=Isoindigo, TTA=4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triyl)&#8208;trianiline, TG=triamino&#8208;guanidinium hydrochloride salt). By introducing two amine core units with different planarity, such as triazine and ionic guanidinium units, we control the morphology, crystallinity, and corresponding electrocatalytic properties of the materials. The combination of isoindigo dialdehyde with a planar triazine core, leads to the formation of thin, highly crystalline, planar two dimensional (2D) nanosheets covalent organic framework (COF), I&#8208;TTA whereas its combination with ionic non&#8208;planar guanidinium core leads to an amorphous covalent organic polymer (COP), I&#8208;TG with a fibrous morphology. The sheet&#8208;like crystalline I&#8208;TTA COF shows better electrocatalytic activity compared to the amorphous fibrous I&#8208;TG COP. I&#8208;TTA exhibits a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at an overpotential of ~134&#8197;mV for HER (in 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4) and ~283&#8197;mV for OER (in 1&#8197;M KOH). The electrocatalytic activity of the I&#8208;TTA COF in the OER exceeds that of other metal&#8208;free COFs. The catalytic activity is maintained even after 24&#8197;hours of chronoamperometry and 500 cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV) at high scan rates.

Herein, we report the synthesis of two imine-linked isoindigo-based covalent organic networks I-TTA and I-TG (I=Isoindigo, TTA=4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;-(1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triyl)-trianiline, TG=triamino-guanidinium hydrochloride salt). By introducing two amine core units with different planarity, such as triazine and ionic guanidinium units, we control the morphology, crystallinity, and corresponding electrocatalytic properties of the materials. The combination of isoindigo dialdehyde with a planar triazine core, leads to the formation of thin, highly crystalline, planar two dimensional (2D) nanosheets covalent organic framework (COF), I-TTA whereas its combination with ionic non-planar guanidinium core leads to an amorphous covalent organic polymer (COP), I-TG with a fibrous morphology. The sheet-like crystalline I-TTA COF shows better electrocatalytic activity compared to the amorphous fibrous I-TG COP. I-TTA exhibits a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at an overpotential of ~134&#8197;mV for HER (in 0.5&#8197;M H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and ~283&#8197;mV for OER (in 1&#8197;M KOH). The electrocatalytic activity of the I-TTA COF in the OER exceeds that of other metal-free COFs. The catalytic activity is maintained even after 24&#8197;hours of chronoamperometry and 500 cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV) at high scan rates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Expanding Polycyclic Tetramate Macrolactam (PoTeM) Core Structure Diversity by Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Synthesis and Bioengineering</title>

Polycyclic tetramate macrolactams (PoTeMs) derive from ornithine&#8208;based lysobacterene A. To expand the PoTeM core structure carbon skeleton by a CH2&#8208;unit, a synthetic access to lysobacterene A and an extended analog was developed, and cyclization by cognate ikarugamycin cyclases IkaBC was achieved in vitro. Building on these results, the adenylation domain of the NRPS IkaA was programmed to directly incorporate l&#8208;lysine, giving biotechnological access to the first backbone&#8208;engineered PoTeM, homo&#8208;ikarugamycin.







Abstract
Polycyclic tetramate macrolactams (PoTeMs) represent a growing class of bioactive natural products that are derived from a common tetramate polyene precursor, lysobacterene A, produced by an unusual bacterial iterative polyketide synthase (PKS)/non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). The structural and functional diversity of PoTeMs is biosynthetically elaborated from lysobacterene A by pathway&#8208;specific cyclizing and modifying enzymes. This results in diverse core structure decoration and cyclization patterns. However, approaches to directly edit the PoTeM carbon skeleton do currently not exist. We thus set out to modify the PoTeM core structure by exchanging the natural l&#8208;ornithine&#8208;derived building block by l&#8208;lysine, hence extending macrocycle size by an additional CH2 group. We developed streamlined synthetic access to lysobacterene A and the corresponding extended analog and achieved cyclization of both precursors by the cognate PoTeM cyclases IkaBC in vitro. This chemo&#8208;enzymatic approach corroborated the catalytic competence of IkaBC to produce a larger macrolactam yielding homo&#8208;ikarugamycin. We thus engineered the adenylation domain active site of IkaA to directly accept l&#8208;lysine, which upon co&#8208;expression with IkaBC delivered a recombinant bacterial homo&#8208;ikarugamycin producer. Our work establishes an entirely new PoTeM structural framework and sets the stage for the biotechnological diversification of the PoTeM natural product class in general.

         <title>Electrochemical CO2 Fixation and Release Cycle Featuring a Trinuclear Zinc Complex for Direct Air Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic fixation&#8208;release of dilute CO2 was carried out continuously in a system consisting of a zinc complex and an electrolytic cell with bipolar membrane. CO2 fixation is promoted by the formation of carbonate&#8208;coordinated complex, and CO2 release is induced by decomposition of the complex structure accompanied by protonation of the ligand. Reconstruction of the complex structure by ligand deprotonation closes the cycle to enable CO2 refixation.







Abstract
CO2 capture technology can mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and global warming. CO2 capture driven by electrochemical reactions is attractive because the operation is carried out at normal temperature and pressure and involves a simple input system using electrical energy. Although promising metal complexes with high CO2 fixation performance have been reported, there are few studies on systems that combine electrochemical reactions and metal complexes. Here, we demonstrated stable CO2 fixation&#8208;release cycles using an electrochemical system with trinuclear Zn(II) complex (Zn3L) as the CO2 fixative and an ionic liquid as a supporting electrolyte for the stable operation. This system showed a faster CO2 fixation rate than that of an aqueous alkaline solution at the same concentration. Continuous release and refixation of CO2 were achieved by decomposition and reconstruction of the complex structure induced by H+ and OH&#8722; supplied from a bipolar membrane equipped in the electrolytic cell. The CO2 fixation&#8208;release cycle was demonstrated even for dilute CO2 (450&#8197;ppm) in air, where the CO2 capture rate reached approximately 46&#8201;% of CO2 contained in the air under an air flow condition of 200&#8197;mL&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;min&#8722;1. This case, combining electrochemical drive and metal complexes, will provide a new option for CO2 capture technology.

         <title>Scalable and Low&#8208;Energy Synthesis of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks by a Seed&#8208;Mediated Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A seed&#8208;mediated metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) synthetic protocol has been developed under mild conditions. This allows MOF production at temperatures from room temperature to 50&#8201;&#176;C, producing highly crystalline structures with increased defects. These features result in a tenfold activity improvement in catalytic iodination. Additionally, the approach is scalable to gram&#8208;level production, demonstrating its potential toward practical applications.







Abstract
The synthesis of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) by low energy input has been a long&#8208;term target for practical applications yet remains a great challenge. Herein, we developed a low&#8208;energy MOF growth strategy at a temperature down to 50&#8201;&#176;C by simply introducing seeds into the reaction system. The MOFs are continuously grown on the surface of the seeds at a growth rate dozens of times higher than that of conventional solvothermal synthesis at low temperature, while the resulting MOFs possess high crystallinity, porosity, and stability similar to solvothermal seeds. Remarkably, the obtained MOFs feature high&#8208;density structural defects with Lewis acidity, thereby displaying more than one order of magnitude higher activity than the MOFs obtained by the conventional solvothermal method in the iodination reaction of substituted arenes. This low&#8208;energy synthetic approach is readily scaled up, which would be a significant step forward in the dream of the MOF industry.

Inspired by natural photosynthesis system, we develop herein an artificial solar energy converter (ASEC) architecture assembled by depositing (CNT) units as &#8220;artificial chlorophyll&#8221; on ordered ionic COF aerogel as reactors and transporters. The ASEC demonstrates a total solar energy conversion (SEC) value of 8047&#8197;kJ&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1, corresponding to parallel production freshwater and H2O2 with rates of 3.56&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 and 19&#8197;mM&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1, respectively.







Abstract
Efficient utilization of solar energy is widely regarded as a crucial solution to addressing the energy crisis and reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Coupling photothermal and photochemical conversion can effectively improve solar energy utilization yet remains challenging. Here, inspired by the photosynthesis system in green plants, we report herein an artificial solar energy converter (ASEC) composed of light&#8208;harvesting units as solar collector and oriented ionic hydrophilic channels as reactors and transporters. Based on such architecture, the obtained ASEC (namely ASEC&#8208;NJFU&#8208;1) can efficiently realize parallel production of freshwater and H2O2 from natural seawater under natural light. The total solar energy conversion (SEC) of ASEC&#8208;NJFU&#8208;1 reaches up to 8047&#8197;kJ&#8197;m&#8722;2&#8197;h&#8722;1, corresponding to production rates of freshwater and H2O2 are 3.56&#8197;kg&#8197;m&#8722;2&#8722;1&#8197;h&#8722;1 and 19&#8197;mM&#8197;m&#8722;2&#8197;h&#8722;1, respectively, which is a record&#8208;high value among all photothermal&#8208;photocatalytic systems reported to date. Mechanism investigation of combining spectrum and experimental studies indicated that the high SEC performance for ASEC&#8208;NJFU&#8208;1 was attributed to the presence of plant bioinspired architecture with carbon nanotubes as solar&#8208;harvestor and COF&#8208;based oriented aerogel as reactors and transporters. Our work thus establishes a novel artificial photosynthesis system for highly efficient solar energy utilization.

The ASEC demonstrates a total solar energy conversion (SEC) value of 8047&#8197;kJ&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, corresponding to parallel production freshwater and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with rates of 3.56&#8197;kg&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 19&#8197;mM&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficient utilization of solar energy is widely regarded as a crucial solution to addressing the energy crisis and reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Coupling photothermal and photochemical conversion can effectively improve solar energy utilization yet remains challenging. Here, inspired by the photosynthesis system in green plants, we report herein an artificial solar energy converter (ASEC) composed of light-harvesting units as solar collector and oriented ionic hydrophilic channels as reactors and transporters. Based on such architecture, the obtained ASEC (namely ASEC-NJFU-1) can efficiently realize parallel production of freshwater and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from natural seawater under natural light. The total solar energy conversion (SEC) of ASEC-NJFU-1 reaches up to 8047&#8197;kJ&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, corresponding to production rates of freshwater and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are 3.56&#8197;kg&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 19&#8197;mM&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, which is a record-high value among all photothermal-photocatalytic systems reported to date. Mechanism investigation of combining spectrum and experimental studies indicated that the high SEC performance for ASEC-NJFU-1 was attributed to the presence of plant bioinspired architecture with carbon nanotubes as solar-harvestor and COF-based oriented aerogel as reactors and transporters. Our work thus establishes a novel artificial photosynthesis system for highly efficient solar energy utilization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enzymatic Cascades for Stereoselective and Regioselective Amide Bond Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amide bond synthetase (ABS) enzymes catalyse amide formation in an environmentally friendly manner. This study advances the application of ABS by integrating these enzymes with other compatible biocatalysts, creating enantioselective and scalable cascade reactions to produce valuable amide products from abundant nitrile precursors. Furthermore, two innovative methods for C&#8722;H bond amidation of aromatic compounds are introduced.







Abstract
Amide bond formation is fundamental in nature and is widely used in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and other valuable products. Current methods for amide synthesis are often step and atom inefficient, requiring the use of protecting groups, deleterious reagents and organic solvents that create significant waste. The development of cleaner and more efficient catalytic methods for amide synthesis remains an urgent unmet need. Herein, we present novel biocatalytic cascade reactions for synthesising various amides under mild aqueous conditions from readily available organic nitriles combining nitrile hydrolysing enzymes and amide bond synthetase enzymes. These cooperative biocatalytic cascades enable kinetic resolution of racemic nitriles and provide a highly enantioselective biocatalytic extension of the Strecker reaction. The regioselective non&#8208;directed C&#8722;H bond amidation of simple arenes was demonstrated through the incorporation of photoredox catalysis to the front end of the cascade. C&#8722;H bond amidation of simple aromatic precursors was also achieved via a CO2 fixation cascade combining enzymatic carboxylation and amide bond synthesis in one&#8208;pot.

         <title>General and Versatile Nanoarchitectonics for Amino Acid&#8208;Based Glasses via Co&#8208;Assembly of Organic Counterions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A counterion co&#8208;assembly strategy has been developed to controllably synthesize amino acid&#8208;based glasses featuring customizable shapes, high mechanical rigidity, and tunable optical properties. This approach addresses the long&#8208;standing challenge of vitrifying small molecules with a strong crystallization tendency, opening avenues for the development of functional supramolecular glasses.







Abstract
Amino acid&#8208;based biomolecular glasses represent an emerging material to meet the demand for sustainable development. However, most amino acids are difficult to vitrify due to their strong crystallization tendency, limiting further advancements of this field. In this study, we demonstrate that the introduction of counterions effectively suppresses crystallization, as hydrogen bonds within the system stabilize the disordered structures. Based on this, we propose a counterion co&#8208;assembly strategy to synthesize a wide range of amino acid&#8208;based glasses. This strategy enables the facile fabrication of glass with customizable shapes, high mechanical rigidity, and tunable multicolor fluorescence, ranging from blue to red depending on the excitation wavelength. Furthermore, this strategy allows the integration and enhancement of counterion properties within the glass matrix. Through the co&#8208;assembly of phosphorescent counterions, we synthesized a series of long&#8208;persistent luminescent glasses with significantly extended afterglow lifetimes. This work presents an effective approach for the synthesis of amino acid&#8208;based glasses and provides insights into the development of supramolecular glasses with tailored functionalities.

         <title>Multicomponent Polymerization toward Poly(BODIPY&#8208;sulfonamide)s as Unique SO2 Generators for Sonodynamic and Gas Combination Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multicomponent polymerization strategy utilizing bipyrroles, sulfonyl azides, and diynes was successfully developed, leading to the synthesis of a library of structurally diverse poly(bipyrrole&#8208;sulfonylimides), which were then converted to the corresponding poly(BODIPY&#8208;sulfonamide) polymers. The unique ultrasound&#8208;induced SO2&#8208;releasing ability of these polymers together with their ability to generate reactive oxygen species endow them as excellent therapeutic agents for combined sonodynamic and gas therapy against cancer.







Abstract
In this work, a multicomponent polymerization (MCP) approach involving bipyrroles, sulfonyl azides, and diynes was developed to afford a library of poly(bipyrrole&#8208;sulfonylimide)s (PPSIs) in high yields and molecular weights, which were further modified to form unique sulfur dioxide (SO2) generators. Bipyrroles served as carbon&#8208;based nucleophiles to undergo Cu&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C coupling during the MCP. Upon post&#8208;MCP modification by transforming the bipyrrole unit to boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) and the sulfonylimide moiety to sulfonamide, poly(BODIPY&#8208;sulfonamide)s (PBSAs) were obtained as potent anticancer therapeutic agents. This study disclosed the decomposition and SO2&#8208;releasing ability of PBSAs under ultrasound (US) irradiation. Furthermore, one of these polymers having a reactive oxygen species&#8208;cleavable thioketal linker was modified with triethylene glycol chains to give PBSA&#8208;EG, which was further studied for in vitro and in vivo US&#8208;induced anti&#8208;cancer therapy. Upon tail veil administration of PBSA&#8208;EG nanoparticles into tumor&#8208;bearing mice followed by US irradiation, remarkable tumor suppression was observed. This study demonstrates that the innovative and efficient MCP method can construct polymers bearing the BODIPY&#8208;sulfonamide moieties, which show a great potential as safe and potent materials for combined gas and sonodynamic therapy against cancer.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Active, Arginine&#8208;Targeting Irreversible Covalent Inhibitors for Non&#8208;Kinases and Kinases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>

We report herein a glyoxal&#8208;based, arginine&#8208;reactive strategy to generate potent and selective small&#8208;molecule Targeted covalent inhibitors (TCIs) of Mcl&#8208;1 (an important anti&#8208;apoptotic protein), Aurora A (a cancer&#8208;related kinase). We showed the resulting compounds were potent, selective and cell&#8208;active with long residence time. We further showed this glyoxal&#8208;based TCI strategy in targeting an acquired drug&#8208;resistance mutant of ALK kinase (G1202R).







Abstract
Targeted covalent inhibitors (TCIs) play an essential role in the fields of kinase research and drug discovery. TCI strategies to target more common amino acid side&#8208;chains have yet to be demonstrated. Targeting other amino acids would also expand the pharmaceutical industry&#8216;s toolbox for targeting other tough&#8208;to&#8208;drug proteins. We report herein a glyoxal&#8208;based, arginine&#8208;reactive strategy to generate potent and selective small&#8208;molecule TCIs of Mcl&#8208;1 (an important anti&#8208;apoptotic protein) by selectively targeting the conserved arginine (R263) in the protein. We further validated the generality of this strategy by developing glyoxal&#8208;based, irreversible covalent inhibitors of AURKA (a cancer&#8208;related kinase) that showed exclusive reactivity with a solvent&#8208;exposed arginine (R220) of this enzyme. We showed the resulting compounds were potent, selective and cell&#8208;active, capable of covalently engaging endogenous AURKA in MV&#8208;4&#8211;11&#8197;cells with long residence time. Finally, we showed the potential application of glyoxal&#8208;based TCIs in targeting an acquired drug&#8208;resistance mutant of ALK kinase (G1202R).

         <title>Multiple Near&#8208;Infrared Chromisms of a Heteromerous Overcrowded Ethylene with Large Permanent Dipole Moment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overcrowded ethylene composed of electron&#8208;donating anion and electron&#8208;accepting cation shows multiple NIR chromisms accompanying the conformational change between folded and twisted conformers. The weak interaction between the anion and cation moieties in the twisted conformer is crucial for multiple NIR chromisms.







Abstract
An overcrowded ethylene composed of electron&#8208;donating anion, naphthoxide, and electron&#8208;accepting cation, acridinium, has been synthesized. It is in equilibrium between a folded conformer having a smaller permanent dipole moment with visible light absorption and a twisted conformer having a larger permanent dipole moment with NIR light absorption. The overcrowded ethylene shows multiple NIR chromisms, such as solvatochromism, thermochromism, mechanochromism, vapochromism, halochromism, and amphoteric electrochromisms, which are caused by the conformational change between folded and twisted conformers or by controlling the energy difference between the HOMO of the donor moiety and the LUMO of the acceptor moiety. The small difference between the HOMO energy level of naphthoxide moiety and the LUMO energy level of acridinium moiety, and their weak interaction are crucial for NIR absorption and large dipole moment in the twisted conformer. The drastic change in the ratio of folded and twisted conformers by changing the polarity of solvents, the detection of CO2, and the disappearance of NIR absorption by electrochemical oxidation and reduction are noteworthy for this new type of organic dye.

         <title>Isolation and Structure Elucidation of the Heterocumulene Anions [NCC&#8208;L]&#8722; (L=CO, CS, N2)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cumulated 5&#8208;atomic cyanodiazomethanide [NCCNN]&#8722; and thioketenyl anion [NCCCS]&#8722; were synthesized from the metalated ylide and ketenyl anion, respectively. Both anions exhibit unexpected stability, but with notable structural differences. While the cyanodiazomethanide features a distinctly bent geometry, the thioketenyl anion was found to be linear, which can be explained by to the stronger &#960;&#8208;accepting properties of the CS ligand.







Abstract
Cumulenes are molecules characterized by a series of consecutive double bonds. They serve as important reagents and intermediates in the synthesis of polymers and a wide variety of functionalized compounds, including various heterocycles. Understanding the properties of cumulenes and developing synthetic routes to these often highly reactive species is essential for unlocking new applications. Here, we report the synthesis and isolation of the cyanodiazomethanide [NCCNN]&#8722; and cyanothioketenyl anion [NCCCS]&#8722;. These 5&#8208;atomic anions exhibit unexpected stabilities but distinct structural differences. Despite the explosive nature of diazoacetonitrile, the [NCCNN]&#8722; anion was sufficiently stable at 0&#8201;&#176;C to allow for first reactivity studies and its structure elucidation revealing a bent structure. The thioketenyl anion is stable at room&#8208;temperature and can be accessed from the cyanoketenyl anion [NCCCO]&#8722; via a [2+2] cycloaddition and cycloreversion sequence with COS elimination. Comparative structural, spectroscopic and computational studies including those on the cyanoketenyl anion [NCCCO]&#8722;, demonstrate that the degree of bending of these heterocumulene anions [NCC&#8208;L]&#8722; can be explained by a transition in the bonding situation from a cumulene structure to an anionic carbone, with the strongly &#960; accepting CS ligand leading to a linear structure of the thioketenyl anion.

         <title>Mastering the Copolymerization Behavior of Ethyl Cyanoacrylate as Gel Polymer Electrolyte for Lithium&#8208;metal Battery Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a facile approach to achieve efficient and controllable copolymerization behaviour of ethyl cyanoacrylate (ECA) without adding undesired additives, affording mechanically robust and high ion&#8208;conduction gel polymer electrolytes for high voltage and long cycle&#8208;life lithium&#8208;metal batteries.







Abstract
Polymers with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (e.g., cyano&#8208;containing polymers) are attractive for a wide range of applications due to their high dielectric constant and outstanding electrochemical stability. However, the polymerization of such monomers is difficult to control with trace of water affording instant reactions, and copolymerization with other monomers without using strong acid is even more challenging. The present study demonstrates a facile approach enabling efficient and controllable copolymerization of ethyl cyanoacrylate (ECA) without adding undesired additives, achieving mechanically robust and high ion&#8208;conduction gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) for safe and long cycle&#8208;life lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). The incorporated dual&#8208;lithium salts, i.e., lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulphonyl)imide (LiTFSI) not only facilitate radical polymerization of ECA monomers by suppressing their anionic polymerization, but also promote the formation of high&#8208;ionic conducting GPE. The incorporated methyl methacrylate (MMA) monomer accelerates the radical polymerization of ECA (confirmed by DFT calculations), achieving controlled copolymerization of ECA&#8208;based copolymers. The mechanically robust polymer network made by the ECA copolymer enables LMBs with both LFP cathodes and high&#8208;voltage LCO cathodes (4.5&#8197;V) operatable at different temperatures with ultra&#8208;long cycle life at 1&#8197;C (capacity retention of 81.1&#8201;% and 83.8&#8201;%, respectively, over 1000 cycles).

A designed tripeptide, which organizes in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail manner as supramolecular helices in its crystal, undergoes a regiospecific single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition polymerization, yielding a malleable and mouldable protein&#8208;mimic. This biocompatible collagen&#8208;mimic undergoes moisture induced hardening and glues both biological specimens and synthetic materials, making it an attractive bioadhesive.







Abstract
A collagen&#8208;inspired helical protein&#8208;mimic has been synthesized via topochemical polymerization of a designed tripeptide monomer. In the monomer crystal, molecules arrange in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail manner, forming supramolecular helices. The azide and alkyne of adjacent molecules in the supramolecular helix are proximally preorganized in a ready&#8208;to&#8208;react arrangement. On heating, the monomer crystals undergo regiospecific single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition polymerization, yielding triazolyl&#8208; polypeptide. Polymerization softens the crystals, making the polymer malleable and mouldable. The polymer grains absorb moisture and form agglomerates through water&#8208;bridged adhesion, which hardens over time. The weight&#8208;bearing capacity of a mould made from this polymer increased by 50&#8208;fold due to moisture&#8208;induced hardening. We have demonstrated that this collagen&#8208;mimic can glue both biological specimens such as wood and bone and synthetic materials such as glass and paper. In vitro studies established the biocompatibility, making it an attractive bioinspired material for potential application as a bioadhesive.

We developed a polymer&#8208;based flexible microelectrode (rGPF) with suitable bending stiffness for self&#8208;supporting brain implantation, low Young's modulus, high biocompatibility, and minimal position shifts. Using DFT calculation, we designed Mg2+ and Ca2+ ligands, creating sensors with excellent selectivity, reversibility, and response time, enabling in vivo recording for 90&#8197;days. Our findings revealed Mg2+ inhibited Ca2+ influx and changes in Mg2+ and Ca2+ aligned with neural pathways during seizures.







Abstract
Monitoring dynamic neurochemical signals in the brain of free&#8208;moving animals remains great challenging in biocompatibility and direct implantation capability of current electrodes. Here we created a self&#8208;supporting polymer&#8208;based flexible microelectrode (rGPF) with sufficient bending stiffness for direct brain implantation without extra devices, but demonstrating low Young's modulus with remarkable biocompatibility and minimal position shifts. Meanwhile, screening by density functional theory (DFT) calculation, we designed and synthesized specific ligands targeting Mg2+ and Ca2+, and constructed Mg&#8722;E and Ca&#8722;E sensors with high selectivity, good reversibility, and fast response time, successfully monitoring Mg2+ and Ca2+ in vivo up to 90&#8197;days. Using this powerful tool, we discovered for the first time that, during the 4&#8208;aminopyridine&#8208;induced seizure in the live brain, extracellular Mg2+ inhibited Ca2+ influx. Moreover, the timing of initial changes in Mg2+ and Ca2+ levels during seizures aligned with neural pathways, which had not been previously reported.

         <title>Amide&#8208;Directed Highly Enantioselective Hydrogenation of Diverse Acyclic Multisubstituted Alkenes Under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed amide&#8208;directed highly enantioselective hydrogenation of acyclic multisubstituted alkenes has been developed. This general catalyst enables enantioselective hydrogenation of a diverse range of alkenes containing 3&#8211;4 alkyl substituents under mild conditions, delivering compounds with contiguous tertiary chiral centers in high yields with &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and up to 99&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
Enantioselective hydrogenation of tetrasubstituted alkenes to form 1,2&#8208;contiguous stereocenters is a particularly appealing but highly challenging transformation in asymmetric catalysis. Despite the notable progress achieved in enantioselective hydrogenation over the past decades, enantioselective hydrogenation of all&#8208;carbon tetrasubstituted alkenes containing multiple alkyl groups remains an unsolved challenge. Here, we report a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrogenation of diverse acyclic multisubstituted alkenes under mild conditions. The coordination assistance of the amide group to the metal center generates a highly active catalyst that effectively overcomes the low reactivity of substrates and precisely controls the stereoselectivity. The generality of this catalyst system is exemplified by its efficacy across at least three types of alkenes including &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated amides, &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides, and enamides.

         <title>An Anionic Mesoionic Carbene (anMIC) and its Transformation to Metallo MIC&#8208;Boranes: Synthesis and Properties</title>

The first general synthesis of triazole&#8208;based anionic mesoionic carbene and their follow&#8208;up chemistry are presented.







Abstract
Neutral mesoionic carbenes (MICs) based on a 1,2,3&#8208;triazole core have had a strong impact on various branches of chemistry such as homogeneous catalysis, electrocatalysis, and photochemistry/photophysics. We present here the first general synthesis of anionic mesoionic carbenes (anMICs, 2) based on a 1,2,3&#8208;triazole core and a borate backbone. The free anMIC is stable in solution under an inert atmosphere at low temperatures, and can be stored for several weeks. Analysis of donor properties shows that these anMICs are extremely strong &#963;&#8208;donors, bypassing the donor properties of strong donors such as MICs, NHCs, anionic NHCs and N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins. The room temperature conversion of the free anMICs leads to three equally interesting compound classes: an amide&#8208;coordinated borane based on a MIC&#8208;borane backbone (2BR3), a polymeric triazolide (1Li) and an amide&#8208;coordinated metallo&#8208;MIC&#8208;borane. The metallo&#8208;MIC&#8208;borane (3Li) is an interesting precursor for the synthesis of further amide&#8208;coordinated MIC&#8208;borane compounds. Quantum chemical calculations have been used to elucidate the mechanism of transformation of the anMICs. We thus introduce three new categories of mesoionic compounds here with potential for different branches of chemistry and beyond.

         <title>Reductive Carbon Materials: Tailoring Chemistry and Electronic Properties to Improve Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ketenes are electron&#8208;rich and highly reactive molecules that are widely used in organic chemistry. Here, electron&#8208;rich ketenes are used to synthesize reductive carbon materials, which are carbon materials with work function lower than that of graphite. By designing ketene&#8208;derivative precursors we can tailor the chemical and electronic properties of the reductive carbons. Furthermore, it is shown that the materials&#8217; work function impacts the plateau capacity of the negative electrode in sodium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
The development of versatile strategies for preparing functional carbon materials is essential for advancing a wide range of applications in materials science. Precursor design plays a pivotal role in governing the chemistry and structure of carbon materials for target applications. In this work, we report the synthesis of Meldrum's acid derivatives through Knoevenagel condensation with aromatic heterocycles such as pyrrole, furan, and thiophene, which serve as precursors for carbonaceous materials with tailored chemical and electronic properties. The thermal condensation of these precursors proceeds via highly reactive, electron&#8208;rich ketene intermediates, playing a crucial role in the formation of the carbon materials. The resulting heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon materials exhibit tunable chemical, physico&#8208;chemical, and structural properties, which we have correlated with their energy storage performances. Eventually, we deem this strategy of high interest for designing high&#8208;performance carbonaceous materials with tunable properties for a broad range of applications, from electrochemical energy storage to conversion, water filtration, environmental remediation, and beyond.

         <title>Photocatalytic Dehalogenation of Aryl Halides Mediated by the Flexible Metal&#8211;Organic Framework MIL&#8208;53(Cr)</title>

         <dc:description>
MIL&#8208;53(Cr), a flexible &#8220;breathing&#8221; metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), exhibits exceptional photocatalytic performance in the dehalogenation of aryl halides. Structural flexibility, driven by the interactions of the MOF with the solvent and substrate, tunes the pore apertures and enhances catalytic efficiency. This study unveils MIL&#8208;53(Cr)&#8242;s dynamic framework reconfiguration, highlighting its potential as a tunable, enzyme&#8208;mimicking photocatalyst for sustainable chemical processes.







Abstract
The catalytic potential of flexible metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) remains underexplored, particularly in liquid&#8208;phase reactions. This study employs MIL&#8208;53(Cr), a prototypical &#8220;breathing&#8221; MOF capable of structural adaptation via pore size modulation, as a photocatalyst for the dehalogenation of aryl halides. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and Pair Distribution Function analyses reveal that organic solvents influence pore opening, while substrates and products dynamically adjust the framework configuration during catalysis. This structural flexibility enables precise tuning of photocatalytic efficiency via solvent&#8208;mediated control of the pore aperture. The results demonstrate that the dynamic behavior of MIL&#8208;53(Cr) facilitates enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity, advancing the application of flexible MOFs as tunable, enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalysts. These findings pave the way for the rational design of next&#8208;generation flexible photocatalysts.

         <title>On the Role of Hydrogen Migrations in the Taxadiene System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long range proton migrations are known to play a role in the biosynthesis of taxa&#8208;4,11&#8208;diene. This study demonstrates the involvement of long distance hydrogen transfers also in the mass spectrometric fragmentation, and combined approaches through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis and enzymatic conversion of designed substrate analogs give detailed insights into their involvement in the biosynthesis of taxa&#8208;4,11&#8208;diene and related compounds.







Abstract
Taxa&#8208;4,11&#8208;diene is made by the taxa&#8208;4,11&#8208;diene synthase (TxS) from Taxus brevifolia. The unique reactivity of the taxane system is characterised by long distance hydrogen migrations in the biosynthesis. This study demonstrates that selective long range hydrogen migrations also play a role in the high energy process of the EI&#8208;MS fragmentation of taxa&#8208;4,11&#8208;diene. A TxS enzyme variant was generated that produces cyclophomactene, a compound that is formed through a concerted process involving a long range proton shift and a ring closure that can also be described as the addition of a methylcarbinyl cation to an olefin. Based on a previous computational study the cyclisation mechanism towards taxa&#8208;4,11&#8208;diene was suggested to involve two long distance proton migrations instead of one direct transfer. A substrate analog with a shifted double bond was converted with TxS to obtain experimental evidence for this proposal.

         <title>A Zero&#8208;Gap Electrolyzer Enables Supporting Electrolyte&#8208;Free Seawater Splitting for Energy&#8208;Saving Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>

A zero&#8208;gap electrolyzer design by integrating the cation exchange membrane (CEM) and bipolar membrane (BPM) assemblies for supporting electrolyte&#8208;free DSS without compromises in operation durability and efficiency.







Abstract
Membrane&#8208;assisted direct seawater splitting (DSS) technologies are actively studied as a promising route to produce green hydrogen (H2), whereas the indispensable use of supporting electrolytes that help to extract water and provide electrochemically&#8208;accelerated reaction media results in a severe energy penalty, consuming up to 12.5&#8201;% of energy input when using a typical KOH electrolyte. We bypass this issue by designing a zero&#8208;gap electrolyzer configuration based on the integration of cation exchange membrane and bipolar membrane assemblies, which protects stable DSS operation against the precipitates and corrosion in the absence of additional supporting electrolytes. The heterolytic water dissociation function of the bipolar membrane in&#8197;situ creates an asymmetric acidic&#8208;alkaline environment, kinetically facilitating H2 and O2 evolution reactions. When working in natural seawater without any chemical inputs, this zero&#8208;gap electrolyzer sustains nearly 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency toward H2 for 120&#8197;h at a current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. With the high&#8208;integrity merit, our electrolyzer can be facilely scaled up into practical cell stacks with significantly increased active area and promising prospects for volume/space&#8208;sensitive application scenarios. This electrolyzer concept opens an underexplored design space for energy&#8208;saving H2 production from low&#8208;grade saline water sources, being complementary to, and potentially competitive with the pre&#8208;purification Schemes.

         <title>Formamidine as an Easy&#8208;On and Easy&#8208;Off Linker for Reversible Crosslinking of Two Alkyl Amines in Peptide Stapling and Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decarboxylative condensation with glyoxylic acid enables facile crosslinking of two alkyl amines via a compact formamidine linkage, facilitating peptide macrocyclization and biomolecule conjugation. This linkage is stable under pH&#8208;neutral and acidic conditions but can be readily cleaved under mild conditions with ethylenediamine or hydrazine in alcohol or aqueous media, fully restoring the amino groups.







Abstract
Amino groups are abundant in both natural and synthetic molecules, offering highly accessible sites for modifying native biorelevant molecules. Despite significant progress with more reactive thiol groups, methods for ligating two amino groups with reversible linkers for bioconjugation applications remain elusive. Herein, we report the use of oxidative decarboxylative condensation of glyoxylic acid to crosslink or ligate two alkyl amines via a compact formamidine linkage, applicable in both intra&#8208; and intermolecular contexts. This linking chemistry exhibits unique hetero&#8208;coupling selectivity between primary and secondary alkyl amines. Although the formamidine linkage is stable under pH&#8208;neutral buffers and acidic conditions, it can be readily cleaved with ethylenediamine or hydrazine under mild conditions in alcohol solvents or aqueous media, fully restoring the amino groups. This study introduces a rare &#8216;easy&#8208;on and easy&#8208;off&#8217; strategy for connecting two native amines in peptide stapling and biomolecule conjugation.

         <title>Competitive Coordination and Dual Interphase Regulation of MOF&#8208;Modified Solid&#8208;State Polymer Electrolytes for High&#8208;Performance Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a MOF&#8208;Modified PEO&#8208;based SPEs for sodium metal batteries. Benefitting from the competitive coordination with PEO and TFSI&#8722; anions, the open metal sites (OMS) of Cu&#8208;MOF effectively weaken Na+&#8722;O bonds and facilitate Na+ migration. More importantly, the formed NaF/Na3N&#8208;rich CEI/SEI layers contribute to realize dual interphase regulation.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have emerged as prominent candidates for solid&#8208;state sodium metal batteries (SMBs) due to their enhanced flexibility and reduced interfacial resistance. However, their performance is limited by poor Na+ conductivity at room temperature, disordered ion transport properties and unstable interfaces. Herein, a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) interconnected copper metal&#8211;organic framework (Cu&#8208;MOF) on polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers is introduced into polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based SPEs to construct a composite electrolyte (PPNM). The open metal sites (OMS) of the Cu&#8208;MOF compete with Na+, effectively coordinating with TFSI&#8722; anions and oxygen atoms in PEO, thereby reducing concentration polarization, weakening the Na+&#8722;O binding strength and facilitating Na+ migration. By harnessing the multifunctional properties of Cu&#8208;MOF and PAN, the PPNM electrolyte exhibits superior ionic conductivity (1.03&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and a high Na+ transference number (0.58) at room temperature. The strong anchoring of TFSI&#8722; anions by Cu&#8208;MOF promotes the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich (NaF and Na3N) cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers, enhancing dual interfacial stability. The Na3V2(PO4)3@C/PPNM/Na full cells realize robust cycling performance for 2000 cycles at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. This work provides a facile strategy for regulating the Na+ coordination state and interphase engineering in solid&#8208;state SMBs.

         <title>Discrete Hybrid Vanadium&#8208;oxo Cluster as a Targeted Tool for Selective Protein Oxidative Modifications and Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid vanadium&#8208;oxo cluster selectively binds to hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) and facilitates localized oxidation in the vicinity of its binding site. These modifications occur under physiological conditions through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of ascorbate (Asc) as a reducing agent. This innovative approach highlights the potential of hybrid metal&#8208;oxo clusters for precise, targeted protein modification.







Abstract
Understanding the impact of oxidative modification on protein structure and functions is essential for developing therapeutic strategies to combat macromolecular damage and cell death. However, selectively inducing oxidative modifications in proteins under physiological conditions remains challenging. Herein we demonstrate that [V6O13{(OCH2)3CCH2OH}2]2&#8722; (V6&#8208;OH) hybrid metal&#8208;oxo cluster can be used for selective protein oxidative cleavage and modifications. We present the first example of a protein&#8208;bound hybrid vanadate cluster, where its interactions with protein surfaces and the redox activity of vanadium enable selective oxidative modifications. Single Crystal X&#8208;ray Diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD) of the V6&#8208;OH and hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) complex revealed that the binding is dictated both by the inorganic core and the organic ligands attached to it. Selective oxidation or cleavage of HEWL occurs under physiological conditions by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) in presence of ascorbate (Asc) as a reducing agent. The outcome of the oxidative reaction can be tuned by varying the concentration of V6&#8208;OH to result either in selective oxidation of the amino acid side chains or peptide bond cleavage. LC&#8211;MS and crystallography revealed that oxidative modifications were mainly concentrated near the cluster binding sites, providing spatial control of ROS production. This study advances our understanding of vanadium's role in biological systems and demonstrates the potential of hybrid metal&#8208;oxo clusters in protein modification.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Localization Transfer Regulation in 3D COFs Enhances Photocatalytic Acetylene Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of [8+4] 3D covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) were developed and applied to photocatalytic acetylene hydrogenation for the first time, which expanded the scope of application of 3D COFs and provided new insight into the design and development of highly efficient photocatalysts.







Abstract
In this work, a series of new crystalline three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) based on [8+4] construction was designed and successfully realized efficient photocatalytic acetylene (C2H2) hydrogenation to ethylene (C2H4). By regulating the hydrogen&#8208;localization transfer effect in these 3D COFs, the Cz&#8722;Co&#8722;COF&#8722;H containing cobalt glyoximate active centers exhibited excellent C2H2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 performance, with an average C2H4 yield of 1755.33&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in pure C2H2, also showed near 100&#8201;% conversion of C2H2 in 1&#8201;% C2H2 contained crude C2H4 mixtures (industry&#8208;relevant conditions), and finally obtain polymer grade C2H4. In contrast, the Cz&#8722;Co&#8722;COF&#8722;BF2 only showed one fifth activity due to lack of hydrogen&#8208;localization transfer. The density functional theory (DFT), projected density of states (PDOS) and molecular dynamics &#8220;slow&#8208;growth&#8221; kinetic calculations based on precise 3D COF structures confirmed that the rapid hydrogen species transfer, enhanced water dissociation and suitable C2H2 adsorption in COFs jointly contributed efficient photocatalytic acetylene hydrogenation (PAH). This work provides new opportunity towards rational design and development of crystalline photocatalysts for C2H2 hydrogenation.

         <title>Efficient Alkaline&#8208;Free Electrooxidation of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;Furandicarboxylic Acid using Electrochemically&#8208;Charged NixCo1&#8208;x(OH)2 as a Redox Mediator</title>

         <dc:description>
Nickel cobalt hydroxide serves as an effective redox medium, which decomposes the traditional oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into independent production processes of hydrogen (H2) and 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). This approach addresses the challenges associated with employing strong alkalis in the oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural and eliminates the necessity for a membrane. The introduction of a moderate amount of Co significantly enhanced the dehydrogenation of the substrate, facilitating the efficient oxidation of HMF in pure water, with the yield and selectivity of the product FDCA nearing 100&#8201;%. This base&#8208;free and membrane&#8208;free system demonstrates the promising scalability and broad applicability for sustainable chemical and energy production.







Abstract
Converting biomass&#8208;derived molecules like 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into value&#8208;added products alongside hydrogen production using renewable energy offers significant opportunities for sustainable chemical and energy production. Yet, HMF electrooxidation requires strong alkaline conditions and membranes for efficient conversion. These harsh conditions destabilize HMF, leading to humin formation and reduced product purity, meanwhile membranes increase costs. Addressing these challenges, we introduce a two&#8208;step, decoupling system that operates without strong alkaline conditions and eliminates the need of membranes. In this system, nickel&#8208;cobalt hydroxides serve as effective redox mediators, driving HMF oxidation in pure water. The experimental results showed that Ni0.85Co0.15OOH effectively promotes the dehydrogenation of substrate and achieves a highly efficient oxidation of HMF in pure water, with the selectivity of product 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) approaching 100&#8201;%. This system has been expanded to oxidize various substrates, achieving yields exceeding 92&#8201;% for the corresponding acids of functionalized compounds such as furfuryl alcohol, furfural, benzyl alcohol, and benzaldehyde. By replacing fixed electrodes with flow electrodes, the scalability of decoupling strategy was evaluated for the harvesting of pure solid FDCA, highlighting the broad prospects in practical applications.

         <title>Mesoporous Cu Nanoplates with Exposed Cu+ Sites for Efficient Electrocatalytic Transfer Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoporous copper nanoplates were prepared by a facile epitaxial growth strategy with the thiol&#8208;functional surfactant as concurrent mesopore&#8208;forming and structure&#8208;controlled template. The product featured oxidated Cu+ sites around mesopores, which stabilized active hydrogen radicals and facilitated transfer semi&#8208;hydrogenation reaction for selective alkene electrosynthesis.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic transfer alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation with H2O as hydrogen source is industrially promising for selective electrosynthesis of high value&#8208;added alkenes while inhibiting byproduct alkanes. Although great achievements, their development has remarkably restricted by designing atomically sophisticated electrocatalysts. Here, we reported single&#8208;crystalline mesoporous copper nanoplates (meso&#8208;Cu PLs) as a robust yet highly efficient electrocatalyst for selective alkene electrosynthesis from transfer semi&#8208;hydrogenation reaction of alkyne in H2O. Anisotropic meso&#8208;Cu PLs were prepared through a facile epitaxial growth strategy with functional C22H45N(CH3)2&#8208;C3H6&#8208;SH as concurrent mesopore&#8208;forming and structure&#8208;controlled surfactant. Different to nonporous Cu counterparts with flat surface, meso&#8208;Cu PLs with spherical mesopores exposed abundant Cu+ sites, which not only stabilized active H* radicals from electrocatalytic H2O splitting without coupling into molecular H2 but also accelerated kinetically the desorption of semi&#8208;hydrogenated alkenes. With 4&#8208;aminophenylacetylene (4&#8208;AP) as the substrate, anisotropic meso&#8208;Cu PLs delivered superior electrocatalytic transfer semi&#8208;hydrogenation performance with up to 99&#8201;% of 4&#8208;aminostyrene selectivity and 100&#8201;% of 4&#8208;AP conversion as well as good cycle stability. Meanwhile, meso&#8208;Cu PLs were electrocatalytically applicable for transfer semi&#8208;hydrogenation of various alkynes. This work thus paved an alternative paradigm for designing robust mesoporous metal electrocatalysts with structurally functional metal sites applied in the selective electrosynthesis of industrially value&#8208;added chemicals in H2O.

With 4-aminophenylacetylene (4-AP) as the substrate, anisotropic &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-Cu PLs delivered superior electrocatalytic transfer semi-hydrogenation performance with up to 99&#8201;% of 4-aminostyrene selectivity and 100&#8201;% of 4-AP conversion as well as good cycle stability. Meanwhile, &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-Cu PLs were electrocatalytically applicable for transfer semi-hydrogenation of various alkynes. This work thus paved an alternative paradigm for designing robust mesoporous metal electrocatalysts with structurally functional metal sites applied in the selective electrosynthesis of industrially value-added chemicals in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient and Robust Europium(III)&#8208;Based Hybrid Lanthanide Scintillators for Advanced X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Current X&#8208;ray scintillators face challenges in efficiency, stability, and flexibility for advanced imaging applications. In this study, we introduce Europium(III)&#8208;based hybrid ternary complex scintillators, integrated with flexible and transparent polymer matrices, offering high radioluminescence, excellent stability, and sensitivity, enabling high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging with superior image quality.







Abstract
Scintillators that convert ionizing radiation into low&#8208;energy photons are essential for medical diagnostics and industrial inspections. Despite advances in X&#8208;ray scintillators, challenges remain in achieving high efficiency, environmental compatibility, stability, and flexibility. Here, we present experimental investigations of a new type of europium(III)&#8208;based hybrid ternary complex scintillators for improved X&#8208;ray detection and imaging. Benefiting from the synergistic interaction between dual organic ligands and lanthanide ions, the Eu(TTA)3Phen complex demonstrates exceptional radioluminescence and light yield under X&#8208;ray excitation, with a detection limit of 19.97&#8197;nGy&#8201;s&#8722;1, well below typical radiation doses used in medical diagnostics. Moreover, lanthanide complex Eu(TTA)3Phen exhibited excellent thermal and photostability, showing minimal degradation even after extended X&#8208;ray exposure. By integrating with flexible polymer matrices, a high&#8208;transmission Eu(TTA)3Phen&#8208;PMMA composite film was fabricated for X&#8208;ray radiography, demonstrating high spatial resolution (&lt;10&#8197;um) and superior image quality across various target samples. These findings hold substantial promise for next&#8208;generation X&#8208;ray imaging applications, offering high sensitivity, stability, flexibility, and versatility, making them ideally suited for advanced radiographic systems.

         <title>Highly Efficient Photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO on Ni&#8208;Based Cationic Polymer with TiO2&#8208;Assisted Exfoliation and Stabilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present an in situ photocatalytic exfoliation strategy to obtain TiO2/NiIP nanosheets with more accessible active sites, shorten electron transport pathways, and favorable key intermediate adsorption, resulting in the high CO production as 54.9&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 with selectivity of 99.9&#8201;%. This work presents a new pathway to acquire efficient and stable porous photocatalysts for CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Porous organic polymers have shown great potential in photocatalytic CO2 reduction due to their unique tunable structure favoring gas adsorption and metal sites integration. However, efficient photocatalysis in porous polymers is greatly limited by the low surface reactivity and electron mobility of bulk structure. Herein, we incorporate TiO2 nanoparticles and Ni(II) sites into a layered cationic imidazolium polymer (IP), in which the imidazolium moieties and free anions can stabilize the key intermediates and enhance the reaction kinetics of CO2 reduction. During the photocatalytic reaction, the layered TiO2/NiIP is in situ exfoliated to nanosheets (NSs) with more accessible active sites and shorten electron transport pathways. The formed TiO2/NiIP&#8208;NSs exhibit an impressively high CO production rate as 54.9&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 with selectivity of 99.9&#8201;%. The embedding with TiO2 nanoparticles could improve the electron transport efficiency so as to facilitate the photochemical stripping process of layered polymer. Moreover, the exfoliated nanosheets with assistance of TiO2 possess excellent stability during the recycling experiments in comparison to the rapidly declined activity of NiIP&#8208;NSs. This work presents a new strategy to construct highly efficient photocatalysts for CO2 reduction.

         <title>In Situ Growth of Metal&#8208;Organic Layer on Polyoxometalate&#8208;etching Cu2O to Boost CO2 Reduction with High Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
POM&#8208;etching for in situ growth of metal&#8208;organic layer can simultaneously incorporate electron sponge and protective layer into Cu2O. The resulting ternary composites exhibit exceptional robustness and achieve efficient CO2 conversion to HCOOH with a yield 55 times higher than that of binary Cu2O@HKUST.







Abstract
Low&#8208;cost Cu2O with a suitable band gap holds great potential for solar utilization. However severe photocorrosion and weak CO2 capture capability have significantly hindered their application in artificial photosynthesis. Herein, polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;etching and in situ growth of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) can simultaneously incorporate electron&#8208;sponge and HKUST protective layer into Cu2O. The resulting ternary composites Cu2O@POM@HKUST&#8208;n (POM=PMo12O40 and PW12O40) with dual hetero&#8208;interfaces can efficiently convert CO2 to HCOOH with 5226&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 yield, over 5 and 55 times higher than that of Cu2O (1010&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1) and Cu2O@HKUST (95.02&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1). In situ XPS and DFT studies reveal that Cu mainly existed in the form of Cu2O and Cu&#8208;MOF, while a unique Cux+ (1&lt;x&#8804;2) surface layer formed upon the Cu2O matrix surrounding POMs for CO2 absorption and activation. Systematic investigations demonstrate that the electron&#8208;sponge can efficiently capture electrons from excited Cu2O to promote the generation of a Cux+ surface layer, while the closely surface&#8208;coating metal&#8208;organic layer can act as protective layer and CO2 adsorbent. This dual function concurrently contributes to promote photocatalysis and prevent Cu2O degradation. Remarkably, the composites exhibit much enhanced photochemical stability and can be used for over 60&#8197;h without noticeable activity loss.

         <title>Porphyrin&#8208;based Vinylene&#8208;linked 3D Covalent Organic Framework with Unprecedented cya Topology for Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cya topological COF was synthesized through the vinylene linkage between saddle porphyrin units and triazine units. This innovative integration of light&#8208;harvesting porphyrin unit, vinylene&#8208;linked conjugated framework, and incorporation of tetrathiafulvalene guests substantially enhanced H2O2 production.







Abstract
Designing and realizing new topologies represent one of the most important ways toward developing new structures and functionalities for molecule&#8208;based frameworks including SOFs, MOFs, and COFs.

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;b&gt;cya&lt;/b&gt; topological COF was synthesized through the vinylene linkage between saddle porphyrin units and triazine units. This innovative integration of light-harvesting porphyrin unit, vinylene-linked conjugated framework, and incorporation of tetrathiafulvalene guests substantially enhanced H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production.

         <title>Ultrastable Imidazole&#8208;linked Porous Organic Cages for Ammonia Capture and Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile one&#8208;pot synthesis has been developed for a new class of porous organic cages (POCs) with imidazole linkages, which exhibit remarkable chemical stability in harsh environments, including strong acidic and alkaline solutions, rendering them promising candidates for ammonia capture and detection.







Abstract
Here, we report the facile synthesis of imidazole&#8208;linked porous organic cages (IPOCs) via an in situ cyclization reaction protocol. Specifically, three IPOCs with [2+4] lantern&#8208;like structures and one with a [3+6] triangular prism structure were successfully prepared through condensation reactions between tetraformyl&#8208;functionalized calix[4]arene and bis(o&#8208;phenylenediamine) monomers in a single pot. Notably, these IPOCs exhibit high porosity, with Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller (BET) specific surface areas reaching up to 1162&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1. Moreover, they demonstrate excellent chemical stability in both strong acidic and alkaline solutions. Furthermore, IPOC&#8208;2 and IPOC&#8208;4 display a remarkable NH3 capturing capability, with uptakes of up to 11.5&#8197;mmol g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K, surpassing most reported porous organic materials. Additionally, IPOC&#8208;1 exhibits highly efficient fluorescent quenching sensing of aqueous NH3, with a detection limit as low as 3.35&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;M. These findings strongly suggest the potential for widespread use of imidazole linkages in the development of robust functional porous organic cage materials for diverse applications.

         <title>Heteroarchitectural Gas Diffusion Layer Promotes CO2 Reduction Coupled with Biomass Oxidation at Ampere&#8208;Level Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
TiB2&#8208;Ag&#8208;PTFE heteroarchitectural gas diffusion layer (GDL) is developed for CO2 electrolyzer. Such GDL possesses good conductivity, strong hydrophobicity, high chemical stability, and compatibility with various catalysts and electrolytes. Coupling the CO2 reduction reaction with 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction, Faradaic efficiencies of 49.2&#8201;% for ethylene and 85.4&#8201;% for 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid are achieved at 1.2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Achieving high product selectivity at ampere&#8208;level current densities is essential for the industrial application of electrochemical CO2 reduction. However, the operational stability of CO2 electrolyzers at large current density has long been hindered by flooding of gas diffusion layer (GDL). Herein, a new heteroarchitectural GDL is designed to overcome flooding. Such GDL is constructed by sequentially sputtering the conductive silver and titanium boride (TiB2) onto a polytetrafluoroethylene substrate. Assembled with Cu catalyst in a flow cell, a maximum ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 64.7&#8201;% was achieved at a current density of 1.2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 6&#8197;M KOH. Furthermore, the GDL is capable of stable operation for over 40&#8197;hours at 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Theoretical calculations and in situ experiments demonstrate enhanced intermediates adsorption on the TiB2&#8208;supported Cu surface, thereby reducing the energy barrier for C&#8722;C coupling. When coupling the CO2 reduction reaction with 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction, Faradaic efficiencies of 49.2&#8201;% for ethylene and 85.4&#8201;% for 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid were achieved at 1.2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work provides a highly stable GDL for efficient CO2 conversion at ampere&#8208;level current density and paves the way for integrating biomolecules conversion in stack&#8208;level devices.

We report a two&#8208;step approach to fabricate CsPbBr3 superstructures with circularly polarized photoluminescence by self&#8208;assembly of nanoclusters, followed by annealing.







Abstract
We report a two&#8208;step approach to fabricate CsPbBr3 superstructures with strongly circularly polarized photoluminescence by self&#8208;assembly of nanoclusters on a substrate, followed by their annealing. In the first step, the nanoclusters self&#8208;assemble upon solvent evaporation, a process that forms mesoscopic superstructures whose geometrical arrangement at the &#956;m&#8208;scale confers them optical chirality. In the second step, mild annealing of such superstructures induces the coalescence of the nanoclusters, accompanied by a continuous red shift of the photoluminescence up to 530&#8197;nm, with preservation of the &#956;m&#8208;scale wires bundles and the chiral properties of the sample (glum=0.1). The successful chirality transfer from the initial nanoclusters assemblies to these final CsPbBr3 superstructures provides a convenient way to obtain circularly polarized emitters.

Two&#8208; and threefold&#8208;fused bipolar dyes based on naphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;dicarboximide and various electron&#8208;rich motifs were synthesized by a facile and efficient cascade process with cesium carbonate. These polyaromatic systems could not be obtained by transition&#8208;metal catalysis.







Abstract
The development of straightforward synthetic methods for photoactive polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that avoid Pd&#8208;catalyzed or radical&#8208;based processes remains a challenge. Such methods are essential to reducing the cost and environmental impact of organic photodevices. In this work, we present a one&#8208;pot synthetic approach for creating novel bipolar PAHs with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation, which are not accessible via conventional Pd&#8208;catalyzed routes. Our cascade process operates exclusively under basic conditions, utilizing cesium carbonate and molecular sieves to facilitate the coupling of electron&#8208;deficient 4&#8208;fluoronaphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;dicarboximide with halogenated electron&#8208;rich moieties. This results in the regio&#8208; and chemoselective formation of new 6&#8208; and/or 5&#8208;membered conjugated rings via consecutive SNAr reactions, as confirmed through experimental and computational studies. The resulting PAHs exhibit strong emissive properties, with quantum yields ranging from 34&#8201;% to 99&#8201;%. This work provides a simple and efficient synthetic strategy for producing novel semiconducting materials, offering a new framework for designing bipolar PAHs with distinct optical characteristics.

         <title>Tailoring Water&#8208;in&#8208;DMSO Electrolyte for Ultra&#8208;stable Rechargeable Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>

A water&#8208;in&#8208;DMSO electrolyte was proposed to achieve stable Zn anodes and cathodes. The Zn2+ solvation structure composed of DMSO and BF4&#8722; leads to the formation of the Zn2+&#8208;conducting SEIs and superior stability of Zn anode. Simultaneously, the water&#8208;in&#8208;DMSO solvent environment reduces deleterious proton insertion, enhancing the stability of VO2 cathode.







Abstract
Rechargeable zinc batteries (RZBs) are hindered by two primary challenges: instability of Zn anode and deterioration of the cathode structure in traditional aqueous electrolytes, largely attributable to the decomposition of active H2O. Here, we design and synthesize a non&#8208;flammable water&#8208;in&#8208;dimethyl sulfoxide electrolyte to address these issues. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ techniques and computational simulations demonstrate that the activity of H2O in this electrolyte is extremely compressed, which not only suppresses the side reactions and increases the reversibility of Zn anode, but also diminishes the cathode dissolution and proton intercalation. The hybrid solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI), formed in situ, helps Zn&#8722;Zn symmetric cell a prolonged lifespan exceeding 10000&#8197;h at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 600&#8197;h at a 60&#8201;% discharge depth. The versatility of this electrolyte endows the Zn&#8208;VO2 full batteries ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance. This work provides insights into electrolyte structure&#8211;property relationships, and facilitates the design of high&#8208;performance RZBs.

         <title>1.5D Chiral Perovskites Mediated by Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Network with Remarkable Spin&#8208;Polarized Property</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
New 1.5D chiral hybrid perovskites, (R/S&#8208;MBA)(GA)PbI4, feature a hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;network&#8208;induced arrangement of zigzag 1D inorganic chains forming a layered architecture. They exhibit long spin lifetimes, stable spin polarization retention, and a remarkable CISS effect with maximum spin polarization degrees of 92&#8201;%&#8211;94&#8201;%, highlighting their potential for spintronics and the vital role of chemical environment in sculpturing spin property of chiral perovskites.







Abstract
In this study, we developed new chiral hybrid perovskites, (R/S&#8208;MBA)(GA)PbI4, by incorporating achiral guanidinium (GA+) and chiral R/S&#8208;methylbenzylammonium (R/S&#8208;MBA+) into the perovskite framework. The resulting materials possess a distinctive structural configuration, positioned between 1D and 2D perovskites, which we describe as 1.5D. This structure is featured by a hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;network&#8208;induced arrangement of zigzag inorganic chains, further forming an organized layered architecture. The structural dimensionality affects both electronic and spin&#8208;related properties. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal Rashba splitting induced by the inversion asymmetry of the crystal structure, while circularly polarized transient absorption spectroscopy confirms spin lifetime on the nanosecond timescale. Magnetic conductive&#8208;probe atomic force microscopy (mCP&#8208;AFM) measurements demonstrate exceptional chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) with maximum spin polarization degrees of (92&#177;1)% and (&#8722;94&#177;2)% for (R&#8208;MBA)(GA)PbI4 and (S&#8208;MBA)(GA)PbI4, respectively. These findings underscore the potential of (R/S&#8208;MBA)(GA)PbI4 as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation spintronic devices, also highlight the critical role of chemical environment in sculpturing the structural dimension and spin&#8208;polarized property of chiral perovskites.

         <title>A Low&#8208;Symmetry Copper Benzenehexathiol Coordination Polymer with In&#8208;Plane Electrical Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel electrically conductive coordination polymer, Cu5BHT, featuring a low&#8208;symmetry structure, is synthesized on the water surface. We demonstrate that Cu5BHT is metallic and exhibits in&#8208;plane electrical anisotropy due to the structure arranged in interconnected well&#8208;conducting CuS4 chains and less&#8208;conducting Cu2S4 slabs oriented along single crystal directions.







Abstract
Electrically conductive coordination polymers (ECCPs), particularly those incorporating benzenehexathiol (BHT) ligands, are emerging as a distinctive class of electronic materials with tunable semiconducting and metallic properties. However, the exploration of novel ECCPs with low&#8208;symmetry structures and electrical anisotropy remains under development. Here, we report the on&#8208;water surface synthesis of a novel ECCP, namely Cu5BHT, which exhibits a low&#8208;symmetry structure and unique in&#8208;plane electrical anisotropy that differs from the well&#8208;known Cu3BHT phase. Utilizing imaging and diffraction techniques, we elucidate the unit cell and crystal structure of Cu5BHT, revealing an asymmetric arrangement of the kagome resembling lattice connected by two different secondary building units: square planar CuS4 and non&#8208;planar Cu2S4. Theoretical studies indicate that Cu5BHT is metallic and exhibits in&#8208;plane electrical anisotropy due to the structure arranged in interconnected well&#8208;conducting CuS4 chains and less&#8208;conducting Cu2S4 slabs oriented along single crystal direction. Single&#8208;crystal electrical measurements confirm a metallic character characterized by the increase of conductance upon cooling. Notably, the measured conductance along different crystal directions within the ab plane unambiguously reveals a significant anisotropy, with an anisotropic factor reaching ~8. This work demonstrates a novel low&#8208;symmetry ECCP and highlights its potential for achieving in&#8208;plane electrical anisotropy.

The Re0.03Ir0.97O2 electrocatalyst, synthesized via the molten&#8208;alkali method, leverages high&#8208;valence ion doping to create abundant oxygen vacancies. These vacancies enhance acidic OER performance by reducing OH intermediate adsorption energy and lowering the rate&#8208;determining step barrier in the AEM pathway.







Abstract
Developing durable IrO2&#8208;based electrocatalysts with high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity under acidic condition is crucial for proton exchange membrane electrolyzers. While oxygen defects are considered potentially important in OER, their direct relationship with catalytic activity has yet to be established. In this study, we introduced abundant oxygen vacancies through Re doping in 2D IrO2 (Re0.03Ir0.97O2), demonstrating their decisive role in enhancing OER performance. The Re0.03Ir0.97O2 catalyst exhibited excellent OER performance with an overpotential of 193&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and sustained activity for over 650&#8197;hours, significantly surpassing the undoped catalyst. Moreover, it maintained operation at a cell voltage of 1.70&#8197;V (~1200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) for over 140&#8197;hours without significant performance degradation. Theoretical calculations coupled with cyclic voltammetry, transient potential scanning and in&#8197;situ characterizations confirmed the adsorbate evolving mechanism on Re0.03Ir0.97O2, as well as the critical role of Re&#8208;induced oxygen vacancies in enhancing OER performance. These findings highlight that oxygen defects directly influence OER activity, providing guidance for the application of oxygen vacancy engineering in electrocatalyst design.

         <title>Chlorine&#8208;Doped SnO2 Nanoflowers on Nickel Hollow Fiber for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction at Ampere&#8208;Level Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chlorine&#8208;doped SnO2 nanoflowers were grown on a hollow fiber electrode with a 3D hierarchical porous structure for exclusive and stable CO2 conversion to formate at ampere&#8208;level current densities. An extremely high CO2 single&#8208;pass conversion rate of 93&#8201;% is achieved through the significantly enhanced mass transfer, well&#8208;retained Sn4+ species and favorable *OCHO intermediate formation.







Abstract
Renewable energy&#8208;driven electrochemical CO2 reduction has emerged as a promising technology for a sustainable future. However, achieving efficient production of storable liquid fuels at ampere&#8208;level current densities remains a significant hurdle in the large&#8208;scale implementation of CO2 electroreduction. Here we report a novel catalytic electrode comprising chlorine&#8208;doped SnO2 nanoflowers arrayed on the exterior of three&#8208;dimensional nickel hollow fibers. This electrode demonstrates exceptional electrocatalytic performance for converting CO2 to formate, achieving a remarkable formate selectivity of 99&#8201;% and a CO2 single&#8208;pass conversion rate of 93&#8201;% at 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, it exhibits excellent stability, maintaining a formate selectivity of above 94&#8201;% for 520&#8197;h at a current density of 3&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Experimental results combined with theoretical calculations confirm that the enhanced mass transfer facilitated by the hollow fiber penetration effect, coupled with the well&#8208;retained Sn4+ species and Sn&#8722;Cl bonds, synergistically elevates the activity of CO2 conversion. The incorporation of chlorine into SnO2 enhances electron transport and CO2 adsorption, substantially lowering the reaction energy barrier for the crucial intermediate *OCHO formation, and boosting the formate production.

         <title>Phosphorescent Liquid Crystalline Polymer&#8208;based Circularly Polarized Luminescence Optical Waveguides for Enhanced Photonic Signal Processing and Information Encryption</title>

         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized phosphorescent optical waveguides with high efficiency have been designed and synthesized using liquid crystalline polymers. These waveguides exhibit low optical loss and emit circularly polarized phosphorescence, making them promising candidates for applications in information encryption, decryption, and optical switching.







Abstract
Efficient circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) optical waveguides have significant potential for advancing photonic and optoelectronic devices. However, the development of CPL optical waveguides materials (OWMs) with low optical loss coefficient remains a considerable challenge. To overcome this, we design and synthesize CPL OWMs based on room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent liquid crystalline polymers (LCPs). Experimental results demonstrate that these LCPs exhibit a nematic liquid crystal phase and a phosphorescence lifetime of approximately 0.145&#8197;ms. By introducing a chiral dopant, we induce a chiral arrangement in the LCPs, followed by crosslinking via photo&#8208;cycloaddition and removal of the chiral dopants through solvent soaking. The resulting polymers exhibit stable solvent resistance and highly efficient circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) properties, with dissymmetric factors (gRTP) in the range of 0.16 to 0.17. Notably, the CPP&#8208;active OWMs exhibit efficient circularly polarized photonic signal waveguiding, with an optical loss coefficient of approximately 0.175 dB/mm. Ultimately, these CPP&#8208;active OWMs are sucessfully applied in information encryption, decryption, and optical switching, paving the way for advanced photonic and optoelectronic devices.

         <title>CeO2 Modification Promotes the Oxidation Kinetics for Adipic Acid Electrosynthesis from KA Oil Oxidation at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiCo2O4/CeO2 is reported to be an outstanding electrocatalyst for the electrooxidation of cyclohexanol to adipic acid. The electronic interactions between CeO2 and NiCo2O4 decrease the energy barrier of cyclohexanone oxidation to 2&#8208;hydroxy cyclohexanone and inhibit the *OH to *O step, thus resulting in AA electrosynthesis with a high yield rate and FE.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic oxidation of cyclohexanol/cyclohexanone in water provides a promising strategy for obtaining adipic acid (AA), which is an essential feedstock in the polymer industry. However, this process is impeded by slow kinetics and limited Faradaic efficiency (FE) due to a poor understanding of the reaction mechanism. Herein, NiCo2O4/CeO2 is developed to enable the electrooxidation of cyclohexanol to AA with a 0.0992&#8197;mmol&#8201; h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 yield rate and 87&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency at a lower potential. Mechanistic investigations demonstrate that cyclohexanol electrooxidation to AA is a gradual oxidation process involving the dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol to cyclohexanone, the generation of 2&#8208;hydroxy cyclohexanone, and subsequent C&#8722;C cleavage. Theoretical calculations reveal that electronic interactions between CeO2 and NiCo2O4 decrease the energy barrier of cyclohexanone oxidation to 2&#8208;hydroxy cyclohexanone and inhibit the *OH to *O step, leading to AA electrosynthesis with a high yield rate and FE. Kinetic analysis further elucidates the effect of CeO2 on promoting cyclohexanone adsorption and activation on the electrode surface, thus facilitating the reaction kinetics. Moreover, a two&#8208;electrode flow reactor is constructed to produce 72.1&#8197;mmol AA and 10.4&#8197;L H2 by using KA oil as the anode feedstock at 2.5&#8197;A (200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), demonstrating promising potential.

         <title>Chiral Nanofibers of Camptothecin Trigger Pyroptosis for Enhanced Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral supramolecular nanofiber of camptothecin (CNF), featuring a right&#8208;handed helicity, is constructed as a pyroptosis inducer for tumor immunotherapy. Upon accumulation in the mitochondria of tumor cells, CNF induces superior reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, thereby activating the caspase&#8208;1/gasdermin D (GSDMD) pathway to trigger pyroptosis. This therapeutic approach effectively modulates the tumor immune microenvironment and enhances cytotoxic T cell&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity, inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis.







Abstract
Camptothecin (CPT), a chemotherapeutic agent, demonstrates significant potential in cancer therapy. However, as a drug, CPT molecule suffers from poor water solubility, limited bioavailability, and insufficient immune response. Herein, we construct CPT nanofibers (CNF) with a right&#8208;handed chiral property via supramolecular self&#8208;assembly, which significantly overcomes the solubility barriers associated with bioavailability and improves tumor immune prognosis. The CNF exhibits high chiral asymmetry factor (gabs) (~0.11) and remarkable structure stability under pH&#8197;6.5 condition. By formulating chiral CNF with mitochondrial&#8208;targeted DSPE&#8208;PEG&#8208;TPP, CNF accumulates specifically in the mitochondria of cancer cells, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and a 3.42&#8208;fold increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation compared to the CPT molecule. This ROS amplification activates the caspase&#8208;1/gasdermin D (GSDMD) pathway, inducing pyroptosis that promotes M1 macrophage polarization and enhances CD8+ T&#8208;cell&#8208;dependent antitumor immunity. Consequently, CNF achieves 1.8&#8208;fold greater growth inhibition of distant tumor and reduces tumor metastasis compared to the CPT molecule. Our innovative platform, assembling CPT molecules into chiral CNF structure, is highly anticipated to overcome the current clinical limitations of CPT molecules and offer a new direction for the development of next&#8208;generation immunotherapy strategies.

         <title>Anchoring Sn Nanoparticles in Necklace&#8208;Like B,N,F&#8208;Doped Carbon Fibers Enables Anode&#8208;Less 5V&#8208;Class Li&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Necklace&#8208;like B,N,F&#8208;doped carbon macroporous fibers embedded with Sn nanoparticles are designed as a lightweight and functionalized host for anode&#8208;less 5V&#8208;class Li&#8208;metal batteries. The macroporous framework, B,N,F&#8208;doped carbon, and lithiophilic Sn nanoparticles enable high plating capacity and homogeneous Li deposition towards anode&#8208;less 5V&#8208;class Li&#8208;metal pouch cells with high energy density and stable cycling performance.







Abstract
Li metal batteries (LMBs), particularly with a limited Li metal anode and a 5V&#8208;class cathode, offer significantly higher energy density compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, the limited Li anode poses severe challenges to cycling stability due to low efficiency and large volume expansion issues associated with Li. Herein, we design a lightweight and functionalized host composed of Sn nanoparticles embedded into necklace&#8208;like B,N,F&#8208;doped carbon macroporous fibers (Sn@B/N/F&#8208;CMFs) toward anode&#8208;less 5V&#8208;class LMBs. The macroporous framework can decrease the local current density to homogenize Li deposition and release structural stress to realize high areal capacity of over 40&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The lithiophilic B,N,F&#8208;doped carbon and Sn nanoparticles can function as high&#8208;affinity Li+ binding sites to uniformize Li nucleus growth on the internal and external surface of hollow fibers. Accordingly, the Sn@B/N/F&#8208;CMFs enable stable dendrite&#8208;free Li plating/stripping behaviors for 1700&#8197;h even in the carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte. When coupled with a 5V&#8208;class LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cathode, the assembled anode&#8208;less pouch cell also displays stable cycling performance even under harsh conditions.

         <title>Confining Phosphoric Acid in Quaternized COF Channels for Ultra&#8208;Stable and Fast Anhydrous Proton Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quaternized covalent organic framework membranes (QACOFMs) with different positively charged groups were fabricated. The strong confinement effect affords ultrahigh H3PO4 retention capability under hydration condition, and the suitable H&#8208;bond length between H3PO4 and highly interconnected H&#8208;bond network enables ultra&#8208;fast anhydrous proton transport.







Abstract
Phosphoric acid (H3PO4) doping is a widely employed strategy to facilitate anhydrous proton transport in high&#8208;temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells (HT&#8208;PEMFCs). However, significant H3PO4 leaching during long&#8208;term operation poses critical challenges to maintaining membrane stability and proton conductivity. Herein, H3PO4 is incorporated into positively charged nanochannels of quaternized covalent organic framework membranes (QACOFMs), leveraging strong electrostatic interactions and confinement effects to achieve exceptional H3PO4 retention under hydration conditions. Moreover, the shortened hydrogen bond length between H3PO4 (O&#8722;H&#8230;O &lt;2.7&#8201;&#197;) and the highly interconnected hydrogen bond network in the H3PO4@QACOFMs facilitate ultra&#8208;fast anhydrous proton transport. As a result, the H3PO4@QACOFMs exhibit superior anhydrous proton transport in a broader temperature range (60&#8201;&#176;C&#8211;200&#8201;&#176;C) and the highest proton conductivity reaches about 379.7&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 200&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Accurate Molecular Sensing based on a Modular and Customizable CRISPR/Cas&#8208;Assisted Nanopore Operational Nexus (CANON)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we establish a universal nanopore sensing strategy named CRISPR/Cas&#8208;Assisted Nanopore Operational Nexus (CANON), which can accurately transduce different targeting sources/species into different DNA structural probes of distinctive nanopore signals. The detection thus can be easily customized into various application scenes with all advantages of high accuracy, high resolution, high simplicity and multi&#8208;assay available.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state nanopore is a promising single molecular detection technique, but is largely limited by relatively low resolution to small&#8208;size targets and laborious design of signaling probes. Here we establish a universal, CRISPR/Cas&#8208;Assisted Nanopore Operational Nexus (CANON), which can accurately transduce different targeting sources/species into different DNA structural probes via a &#8220;Signal&#8208;ON&#8221; mode. Target recognition activates the cleavage activity of a Cas12a/crRNA system and then completely digest the blocker of an initiator. The unblocked initiator then triggers downstream DNA assembly reaction and generate a large&#8208;size structure easy for nanopore detection. Such integration of Cas12a/crRNA with DNA assembly establishes an accurate correspondence among the input targets, output DNA structures, and the ultimate nanopore signals. We demonstrated dsDNA, long RNA (i.e., Flu virus gene), short microRNA (i.e., let&#8208;7d) and non&#8208;nucleic acids (i.e., Pb2+) as input paradigms. Various structural assembly reactions, such as hybridization chain reaction (HCR), G&#8208;HCR and duplex polymerization strategy (DPS), are adapted as outputs for nanopore signaling. Simultaneous assay is also verified via transferring FluA and FluB genes into HCR and G&#8208;HCR, respectively. CANON is thus a modular sensing platform holding multiple advantages such as high accuracy, high resolution and high universality, which can be easily customized into various application scenes.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent adaptable networkshave been created that feature oligo[2]rotaxane backbones densely integrated with mechanical bonds and cross&#8208;linked through dynamic C&#8722;N bonds. The oligo[2]rotaxane backbones provide mechanical robustness and enable unique mechanical adaptability through the dissociation of host&#8211;guest interactions followed by a sliding motion. The dynamic C&#8722;N bond transalkylation at 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium sites imparts the material with excellent reprocessability.







Abstract
Covalent adaptable networks (CANs), a novel class of crosslinked polymers with dynamic covalent bonds, have gained significant attention for combining the durability of thermosets with the reprocessability of thermoplastics, making them promising for emerging applications. Here, we report the first example of poly[2]rotaxane&#8208;type covalent adaptable networks (PRCANs), in which oligo[2]rotaxane backbones characterized by densely packed mechanical bonds, are cross&#8208;linked through dynamic C&#8722;N bonds. The oligo[2]rotaxane backbones could guarantee the mechanical properties of the CANs. Under an external force, the synergy of numerous microscopic motions of the cascade [2]rotaxane units, progressively introducing the initially hidden short chains, expands the polymer network, imparting good stretchability to the PRCANs (217&#8201;%). On the other hand, the dissociation of host&#8208;guest recognition, followed by the motion of mechanical bonds, constitutes a unique energy dissipation pathway, ultimately enhancing the toughness of PRCANs (7.6&#8197;MJ/m3). In contrast, the control CAN, which lacks movable mechanical bonds, demonstrates significantly lower stretchability (40&#8201;%) and toughness (1.5&#8197;MJ/m3). Moreover, the dynamic C&#8722;N bond can undergo high efficiency of 1,2,3&#8208;triazole alkylation and trans&#8208;N&#8208;alkylation exchanges at 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium sites at elevated temperatures, with good reprocessability and without compromising their mechanical performance. This work demonstrates the great potential of oligo[2]rotaxanes as a novel polymer backbone for the development of sustainable materials with excellent mechanical properties.

         <title>Delocalized Nonbonding Orbitals of Thioxanthone in Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons for Reduced Energy Gap and Narrowband Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chalcogen&#8208;containing carbonyl groups have been incorporated into fused organoboron multiple resonance emitters. 2TXBN and BNTXBN exhibit bright orange&#8208;red emissions with maxima at 582 and 585&#8197;nm, respectively, along with narrow full widths at half maximum of 30 and 32&#8197;nm. Furthermore, the nonbonding orbital of 2TXBN delocalizes within the thioxanthone segment, which raises the first triplet energy level and reduces the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap.







Abstract
Chalcogen&#8208;containing carbonyls, specifically thioxanthone (TX), hold great potential in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). While the development of narrowband OLEDs with chalcogen&#8208;containing carbonyls remains challenging due to difficulties in achieving both high device efficiency and narrow emission spectra. Herein, via a strategic incorporation of the TX moiety, two orange&#8208;red narrowband emitters, 2TXBN and BNTXBN, are designed and synthesized for the first time. Both 2TXBN and BNTXBN exhibit bright orange&#8208;red emissions with peaks at 582 and 585&#8197;nm, respectively, along with narrow full widths at half maxima of 30 and 32&#8197;nm. Notably, 2TXBN demonstrates delocalization of the nonbonding orbital within the TX segment, which raises the first triplet energy level and reduces the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap. This electronic structural adjustment effectively shortens the delayed fluorescence lifetime, leading to enhanced device performance. Accordingly, OLED employing 2TXBN as the emitter achieves remarkable performance, with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 31.0&#8201;%, a current efficiency of 69.0&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1, and a power efficiency of 76.0&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1, highlighting the efficacy of the nonbonding orbital delocalization strategy in achieving bathochromic&#8208;shifted narrowband OLED materials.

         <title>Leveraging Multivalent Assembly towards High&#8208;Temperature Liquid&#8208;Phase Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient strategy based on the supramolecular assembly of multivalent modules has been used to obtain high&#8208;temperature liquid&#8208;phase phosphorescence (HTLP) rosettes. The assembled rosettes demonstrate excellent HTLP emissions even in various high&#8208;temperature polar media such as boiling water, DMSO and NMP as a result of the suppression of non&#8208;radiative dissipations through multivalent interactions.







Abstract
High&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (HTP) materials have attracted considerable attention owing to their expanded application prospects, whereas they still suffer from severe deactivation in polar media, limiting their reliability and utility. Here, we present an efficient multivalent assembly strategy to achieve high&#8208;temperature liquid&#8208;phase phosphorescence (HTLP). The supramolecular assembly of multivalent modules leads to extremely robust hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks, which firmly immobilize the organic phosphors and protect triplet excitons from annihilation in high&#8208;temperature polar media, resulting in excellent HTLP emission. Moreover, the photophysical properties of HTLP are significantly enhanced by boosting multivalent interactions using multitopic phosphors, demonstrating a visible afterglow of 5&#8197;s in boiling water, more than 2&#8197;s in dimethylsulfoxide at 460&#8197;K (187&#8201;&#176;C), and a long lifetime of 70.3&#8197;ms in N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone at 476&#8197;K (203&#8201;&#176;C). Based on their fluidity and robust HTLP emission, in&#8197;situ microcracks detection of high&#8208;temperature operating instruments and spatial&#8208;time&#8208;temperature&#8208;resolved anticounterfeiting are demonstrated.

         <title>Stabilizing Lattice Oxygen of Bi2O3 by Interstitial Insertion of Indium for Efficient Formic Acid Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insertion of active indium atoms enhances the bond stability within Bi2O3 lattice and preserves the oxygen stability, leading to In&#8208;Bi2O3 catalysts that deliver high current densities with excellent formic acid selectivity (&gt;95&#8201;%) and robust stability over prolonged electrochemical operations.







Abstract
Bismuth oxide (Bi2O3) emerges as a potent catalyst for converting CO2 to formic acid (HCOOH), leveraging its abundant lattice oxygen and the high activity of its Bi&#8722;O bonds. Yet, its durability is usually impeded by the loss of lattice oxygen causing structure alteration and destabilized active bonds. Herein, we report an innovative approach via the interstitial incorporation of indium (In) into the Bi2O3, significantly enhancing bond stability and preserving lattice oxygen. The optimized In&#8208;Bi2O3&#8208;100 catalyst achieves over 90&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency for HCOOH production across a wide potential range, in both H&#8208;cells and flow cells, maintaining robust stability after 100&#8197;hours of continuous operation. In situ surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the interstitial In doping precisely tunes the adsorption of CO2* and OCHO* intermediate, facilitating rapid conversion. Further in situ Raman spectroscopy confirms the role of In bolstering the oxidized structure's stability within Bi2O3, critical for sustaining lattice oxygen during electrochemical CO2 reduction.

Sym&#8208; and asym&#8208;expanded heterohelicene isomers were developed by one&#8208;pot borylation synthesis, which exhibit narrowband deep&#8208;blue emission with record&#8208;setting FWHM of 18&#8197;nm and near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield. Corresponding OLED showed superb performance with external quantum efficiency up to 25&#8201;% and small efficiency roll&#8208;off even at high luminance of 10, 000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
Expanded heterohelicenes composed of alternating linearly and angularly fused multi&#8208;resonance (MR) skeletons have gained wide interest owing to their promising narrowband emissions. Herein, a pair of sym&#8208; and asym&#8208;expanded heterohelicene isomers was obtained by merging boron/oxygen (B/O)&#8208;embedded MR triangulene and indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole units via one&#8208;pot synthesis. Owing to their fully resonating extended helical skeleton, the target heterohelicenes exhibit a significantly narrowed spectra bandwidth while emission red&#8208;shifting, thus affording deep&#8208;blue narrowband emission with a peak at approximately 460&#8197;nm, full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of only 18&#8197;nm, and near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yields. In comparison to the symmetrical structure, the asym&#8208;expanded heterohelicene displays suppressed aggregation within doped films, thereby showing superior narrowband electroluminescence in devices with CIE coordinates of (0.12, 0.18) and a high external quantum efficiency of up to 25&#8201;%, which retains 18.1&#8201;% even at a high luminance of 10,000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;1. Overall, this work provides a novel paradigm for the development of narrowband expanded heterohelicenes.

         <title>A BODIPY&#8208;Containing Covalent Organic Framework as a Highly Porous Photosensitizer for Environmental Remediation and Pollutants Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Borondipyrromethene (BODIPY) chromophores have been directly implemented into the highly porous covalent organic framework BDP&#8208;TFP&#8208;COF which crystallizes in AA stacking mode with hbc topology. The versatility of multifunctional BODIPY&#8208;COFs is highlighted in various applications ranging from dual&#8208;mode fluorescence sensing to pollutants removal from aqueous solutions and detoxification of a mustard gas simulant via photosensitization.







Abstract
The direct incorporation of borondipyrromethene (BODIPY) subunits into the structural backbone of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) gives facile access to porous photosensitizers but is still a challenging task. Here, we introduce &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked BDP&#8208;TFP&#8208;COF, which crystallizes in AA&#8208;stacking mode with hcb topology. A comprehensive characterization reveals high crystallinity and enhanced stability in a variety of solvents, excellent mesoporosity (SABET=1042&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), broad light absorption in the visible region, and red emission upon the exfoliation of few&#8208;layer COF nanosheets. The versatility of multifunctional BODIPY&#8208;COFs is highlighted in various applications. Pollutants Bisphenol A (BPA, qmax=426&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1) and Methylene Blue (MB, qmax=96&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1) have been efficiently removed from H2O. Fluorescence quenching or enhancement of exfoliated BDP&#8208;TFP&#8208;COF nanosheets have been utilized for dual&#8208;mode sensing of MB or NEt3, respectively. Ultimately, the photosensitizing effect of the BODIPY units is retained in the COF. Thus, BPD&#8208;TFP&#8208;COF was established as a metal&#8208;free triplet photosensitizer, which efficiently oxidized a mustard gas simulant under visible light irradiation.

         <title>Size&#8208;Adjustable High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Nanoparticles as an Efficient Platform for Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>

A series of ultrasmall and size&#8208;tunable high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles are synthesized via a spatially confined strategy, which demonstrate a size&#8208;dependent activity in various electrocatalytic reactions.







Abstract
The high entropy alloy (HEA) possesses distinctive thermal stability and electronic characteristics, which exhibits substantial potential for diverse applications in electrocatalytic reactions. The nanosize of HEA also has a significant impact on its catalytic performance. However, accurately controlling nanosize and synthesizing small HEA nanomaterials remains a challenge, especially for the ultrasmall HEA nanoparticles. Herein, we firstly calculate and illustrate the impact of size on the electronic structure of HEA as well as the adsorption energies of crucial intermediates involved in typical electrocatalytic processes, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) and NO3&#8722; electroreduction (NO3RR). Under the guidance of theoretical calculations, we synthesize a range of ultrasmall PtRuPdCoNi HEA nanoparticles with adjustable sizes (1.7, 2.3, 3.0, and 3.9&#8197;nm) using a one&#8208;step spatially confined approach, without any further treatment. Experimentally, the smaller size of HEAs is more favorable for the HER and ORR performances, aligning well with theoretical predictions. Specifically, HEA nanoparticles sized at 1.7&#8197;nm (HEA&#8208;1.7) endows a 16&#8197;mV overpotential at current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, yielding a mass activity of 31.9&#8197;A&#8201;mgNM&#8722;1 of noble metal in HER, significantly outperforming commercial Pt/C catalyst. This strategy can also be easily applicable to other reduction reactions (e.g. CO2, NO3&#8722;) attributed to the richness of metal components and size adjustability, presenting a promising platform for various electrocatalytic applications as advanced catalysts.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted Prediction of Photothermal Metal&#8208;Phenolic Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To extend the scope of photothermal metal phenolic networks (MPN), a photothermal library of 80 MPNs was made in&#8208;house and used for the construction of machine learning models. Potential high photothermal MPNs were screened from a virtual library of 44,438 MPN by the optimal model and verified by experiments.







Abstract
Photothermal therapy (PTT) demonstrates significant potential in cancer treatment, wound healing, and antibacterial therapy, with its efficacy largely depending on the performance of photothermal agents (PTAs). Metal&#8208;phenolic network (MPN) materials are ideal PTA candidates due to their low cost, good biocompatibility and excellent ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer properties. However, not all MPNs exhibit significant photothermal properties, and the vast chemical space of MPNs (over 700,000 potential combinations) complicates the screening of high&#8208;photothermal materials. To address this challenge, this study introduces machine learning (ML) methods for predicting the photothermal performance of MPNs. A database of photothermal properties of 80 modular MPNs was constructed, and the ML process was optimized through feature engineering and model training. The selected extreme gradient boosting model (XGBoost) successfully identified 1,654 high photothermal MPNs from a virtual database of 44,438. Subsequent experimental validation revealed a remarkable success rate of 70&#8201;% in predicting high photothermal MPNs. Additionally, several previously unreported high photothermal MPNs were discovered, demonstrating advantages in photothermal antibacterial applications. This study offers an innovative ML&#8208;driven approach for the efficient screening of MPN materials, providing a solid foundation for PTA design in PTT and other biomedical applications.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processed Blue Narrowband OLED Devices with External Quantum Efficiency Beyond 35&#8201;% through Horizontal Dipole Orientation Induced by Electrostatic Interaction</title>

Electrostatic interaction between a dendritic host (8CzTPS) with a strong positive electrostatic potential (ESP) and a dendritic emitter (D2&#8208;DBN) with multiple negative ESP sites was used to induce a high horizontal dipole orientation of 83.0&#8201;% for the emitter in solution&#8208;processed films. The resulting blue narrowband device realizes an external quantum efficiency of 35.3&#8201;% and narrow bandwidth of 17&#8197;nm.







Abstract
The multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) device has drawn great attention due to their outstanding efficiency and color purity. However, the efficiency of solution&#8208;processed MR&#8208;TADF devices is still far behind their vacuum&#8208;deposited counterparts, due to the uncontrollable horizontal emitting dipole orientation for emitters during solution process, resulting in low light out&#8208;coupling efficiency. Here, we proposed a new strategy namely electrostatic interaction between a dendritic host with high positive electrostatic potential (ESP) and dendritic emitter with multiple negative ESP sites, which could induce high horizontal dipole ratio (&#920;||) up to 83.0&#8201;% in solution&#8208;processed films. For this couple, the largest plane of dendritic host tends to anchor on the substrate, and thus the strong positive electrostatic site mainly lies at the exposed tetraphenylsilicon, which could electrostatically attract the multiple negative electrostatic sites of the dendritic emitter, realizing horizontal dipole orientation. Moreover, the highly twisted structure of dendritic host and dendron encapsulation of emitter could effectively suppress aggregation, leading a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 98.6&#8201;%. As a result, the solution&#8208;processed blue MR&#8208;TADF devices exhibit a record&#8208;break external quantum efficiency of 35.3&#8201;%, as well as narrow bandwidth of 17&#8197;nm and pure blue color with CIE coordinates of (0.137, 0.176).

We utilize the mixed SAM strategy via the MeO&#8208;2PACz along with perfluorotripropylamine (FC&#8208;3283) to improve the SAM coverage. The champion device with the mixed&#8208;SAM achieves an efficiency of 25.70&#8201;% (certified efficiency of 25.6&#8201;%) with long&#8208;term stability (maintained the initial efficiency of 90&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;h and 180&#8197;h under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1 and ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2).







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAM) as hole transport layers have been widely used in high&#8208;efficiency inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exceeded 26&#8201;%. However, the poor coverage and non&#8208;uniform distribution on the substrate of SAM further restrict the improvement of device performance. Herein, we utilize the mixed SAM strategy via the MeO&#8208;2PACz along with perfluorotripropylamine (FC&#8208;3283) to improve the SAM coverage, aiming to accelerate the carrier transport, promote the perovskite growth, regulate the surface energy levels and suppress the nonradiative recombination. The champion device with the mixed&#8208;SAM achieves an efficiency of 25.70&#8201;% (certified efficiency of 25.6&#8201;%) with long&#8208;term stability (maintained the initial efficiency of 90&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;h and 180&#8197;h under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1 and ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2).

         <title>Orderly Arranged Cubic Quantum Dots along Supramolecular Templates of Naphthalenediimide Aggregates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;dimensional array superstructures of cubic quantum dots are formed by sandwiching them between unique supramolecular polymer templates composed of organic molecular assemblies. The array superstructures of cubic quantum dots exhibit energy transfer between uniformly arranged quantum dots.







Abstract
Precise control of assembled structures of quantum dots (QDs) is crucial for realizing the desired photophysical properties, but this remains challenging. Especially, the one&#8208;dimensional (1D) control is rare due to the nearly isotropic nature of QDs. Herein, we propose a novel strategy for controlling the 1D&#8208;arrangement range of cubic perovskite QDs in solution based on the morphological modification of a supramolecular polymer (SP) template. The original template with a short and tangled fibrous structure is prepared in a low&#8208;polarity solvent mixture via self&#8208;assembly of a naphthalenediimide&#8208;functionalized cholesterol derivative with an adhesion group for QDs. Mixing this template with QDs leads to the co&#8208;aggregation into short&#8208;range 1D&#8208;arrays of QDs on the templates. Notably, subsequent heating and cooling of the co&#8208;aggregate solution forms longer&#8208;range 1D&#8208;arrays of QDs with lateral growth, where arranged QDs are sandwiched between reconstructed SP templates. Furthermore, the longer&#8208;range 1D&#8208;array of QDs is achieved via an alternative route involving the pre&#8208;organization of templates into longer and dispersed fibers by heating and cooling of the original template, succeeded by co&#8208;assembly with QDs. Finally, we reveal continuous fluorescence resonance energy transfer between 1D&#8208;arranged QDs by an in&#8208;depth analysis of the photoluminescence decay curves.

         <title>From Guest&#8208;Induced Crystallization to Molecular Imprinting: Calculation&#8208;Guided Discovery of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Tetrazole Frameworks for p&#8208;Xylene Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermodynamic principles for the guest&#8208;induced crystallization of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) were established from crystal structure data and DFT calculations of the formation energy. Suitable guests could be identified for kinetically challenging but structurally interesting HOFs. Moreover, a new HOF for p&#8208;xylene separation with molecular imprinting effect was discovered.







Abstract
Exploring host&#8211;guest interactions to regulate hydrogen&#8208;bonding assembly offers a promising approach for developing advanced porous crystal materials (PCMs). However, screening compatible guests with appropriate geometries and host&#8211;guest interactions that could inhibit the dense packing of building blocks remains a primary challenge. This study presents a novel guest&#8208;induced crystallization (GIC) strategy, guided by thermodynamic calculations, to develop porous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) using structurally challenging tetrazole building units. Thermodynamic principles are established from the crystal structure data and the density functional theory calculation of the formation energy (&#916;E). This provides criteria to identify available guests in GIC, enabling the successful discovery of a hidden HOF that is kinetically challenging to crystallize. Furthermore, the potential application for p&#8208;xylene (PX) separation is predicted by analyzing the &#916;E of guest&#8208;induced HOFs. A high PX selectivity (PX/m&#8208;xylene=6.1, PX/o&#8208;xylene=7.2, and PX/ethylbenzene=4.1) is achieved through selective inclusion of PX from C8 aromatic isomers within the guest&#8208;induced HOFs. Significantly, the guest&#8208;free HOF (HOF&#8208;PX&#8208;a), bearing PX&#8208;templated cavities derived from molecular imprinting, shows a record&#8208;high PX/ethylbenzene selectivity (21.7) in liquid adsorption. This work elucidates the underpinning self&#8208;assembly rules of GIC for HOF construction, providing exciting new opportunities for the predictable assembly of PCMs for molecular recognition and target&#8208;specific separations.

A modular approach for the first catalytic asymmetric total syntheses of (+)&#8208;chamaecydin and (+)&#8208;isochamaecydin and their 1&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;epimers is presented. Our synthesis is highlighted by a metal&#8208;halogen exchange/addition reaction to connect the A&#8722;B ring system with E ring system through a convergent strategy and a Michael/aldol cascade for constructing the central C&#8722;D ring system, allowing for a rapid construction of the pentacyclic framework.







Abstract
A modular approach was developed for the first catalytic asymmetric total syntheses of naturally occurring C30 terpene quinone methides and their non&#8208;natural stereoisomers, which feature the presence of an unprecedented spiro[4.4]nonane&#8208;containing 6&#8211;6&#8211;6&#8208;5&#8211;5&#8211;3 hexacyclic skeleton. Resting on a chiral phosphinamide&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reduction of 2,2&#8208;disubstituted cyclohexane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione, a concise route for the synthesis of enantioenriched 6&#8211;6 bicyclic fragment was developed. The 6&#8211;6 ring fragment and the five&#8208;membered ring fragment were unified via a metal&#8208;halogen exchange/intermolecular addition reaction. Subsequently, the central 6&#8211;5 bicyclic ring system was constructed through a Michael/aldol cascade. The successful establishment of these strategic transformations allowed for an efficient and rapid construction of spiroannulated 6&#8211;6&#8211;6&#8211;5&#8211;5 pentacarbocyclic core via a convergent manner. Finally, the total syntheses of naturally occurring (+)&#8208;chamaecydin and (+)&#8208;isochamaecydin and their corresponding 1&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;stereoisomers have been achieved divergently by appropriately orchestrating the reaction sequence including isopropyl incorporation, oxidation state adjustment, and carbonyl group&#8208;directed regio&#8208; and stereoselective cyclopropanation at a late stage.

     alt="Catalytic Asymmetric Total Synthesis of (+)-Chamaecydin and (+)-Isochamaecydin and their Stereoisomers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A modular approach for the first catalytic asymmetric total syntheses of (+)-chamaecydin and (+)-isochamaecydin and their 1&#8217;,5&#8217;-epimers is presented. Our synthesis is highlighted by a metal-halogen exchange/addition reaction to connect the A&#8722;B ring system with E ring system through a convergent strategy and a Michael/aldol cascade for constructing the central C&#8722;D ring system, allowing for a rapid construction of the pentacyclic framework.

         <title>Cationic Magnetically Active Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon with Record Low Band Gap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extended long polycyclic hydrocarbon incorporating two pyrrole units has been developed. Its cationic species exhibit remarkable electronic and magnetic properties, including a record&#8208;low energy gap for the cationic radical, with an extinction coefficient of 3.8&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 2570&#8197;nm, and unusual symmetry&#8208;broken charge transfer. The dication exhibits high Chichibabin diradical character with separated spin localizations.







Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have attracted significant interest in material chemistry, particularly if they own extremely low band gaps and magnetic properties. However, challenges remain regarding the synthetic accessibility and energy saturation issues. In this study, we introduce NR&#8208;11, which consists of eleven aromatic rings in its main conjugation and is separately doped with two electron&#8208;rich nitrogen atoms. This unique structure imparts intriguing oxidation characteristics to NR&#8208;11. The cationic radical NR&#8208;11+&#8901; exhibits enhanced stability and demonstrates strong absorption in the range of 1250&#8197;nm to 3000&#8197;nm, peaking at 2570&#8197;nm. As a result, the optical energy gap of NR&#8208;11+&#8901; is one of the lowest reported to date. Additionally, X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis reveals that NR&#8208;11+&#8901; displays unusual symmetry&#8208;broken charge separation. For the dication, variable&#8208;temperature NMR and variable&#8208;temperature EPR studies indicate that NR&#8208;112+ exhibits a high diradical character with a &#9653;ES&#8208;T of approximately &#8722;1&#8197;kcal/mol. Additionally, its spins are polarized at two ends of the PAH. Meanwhile, its strong absorption in the near&#8208;infrared II region suggests promise in photoacoustic (PA) conversion applications. This work underscores the significance of cationic species of extended long PAHs, highlighting their exceptional properties and potential applications.

         <title>Symmetry Breaking of FeN4 Moiety via Edge Defects for Acidic Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through morphology engineering, asymmetric edge&#8208;carbon is introduced into Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts, effectively breaking the symmetry of the FeN4 structure and enabling precise control over its geometric and electronic properties, thereby enhancing catalytic activity for the acidic oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts, with a planar D4h symmetric FeN4 structure, show promising as noble metal&#8208;free oxygen reduction reaction catalysts. Nonetheless, the highly symmetric structure restricts the effective manipulation of its geometric and electronic structures, impeding further enhancements in oxygen reduction reaction performance. Here, a high proportion of asymmetric edge&#8208;carbon was successfully introduced into Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts through morphology engineering, enabling the precise modulation of the FeN4 active site. Electrochemical experimental results demonstrate that FeN4@porous carbon (FeN4@PC), featuring enriched asymmetric edge&#8208;FeN4 active sites, exhibits higher acidic oxygen reduction reaction catalytic activity compared to FeN4@flaky carbon (FeN4@FC), where symmetric FeN4 is primarily distributed within the basal&#8208;plane. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectra, X&#8208;ray emission spectra, and theoretical calculations indicate that the enhanced oxygen reduction reaction catalytic activity of FeN4@PC is attributed to the higher oxidation state of Fe species in the edge structure of FeN4@PC. This finding paves the way for controlling the local geometric and electronic structures of single&#8208;atom active sites, leading to the development of novel and efficient Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts.

         <title>Functionalization of Pyridines at the C4 Position via Metalation and Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
n&#8208;Butylsodium can be used to selectively deprotonate pyridine at the C4 position, in sharp contrast to organolithium reagents which lead to nucleophilic addition at the C2 position. A wide range of 4&#8208;alkyl pyridines and 4&#8208;aryl pyridines were synthesized by this protocol. Rapid injection NMR studies indicate that the interchange of different sodiopyridine species follows thermodynamic distribution and results in the selection of the C4 position.







Abstract
The functionalization of pyridines at positions remote to the N&#8208;atom remains an outstanding problem in organic synthesis. The inherent challenges associated with overriding the influence of the embedded N&#8208;atom within pyridines was overcome using n&#8208;butylsodium, which provided an avenue to deprotonate and functionalize the C4&#8208;position over traditionally observed addition products that are formed with organolithium bases. In this work, we show that freshly generated 4&#8208;sodiopyrdines could undergo transition metal free alkylation reactions directly with a variety of primary alkyl halides bearing diverse functional groups. In addition, after transmetalation to zinc chloride a simple and efficient Negishi cross&#8208;coupling protocol was formulated for a variety of aromatic and heteroaromatic halides. The robustness of this protocol was demonstrated through the late&#8208;stage installation of 4&#8208;pyridyl fragments into a variety of complex active pharmaceutical ingredients including loratadine and prochlorperazine. Furthermore, through rapid injection NMR investigations, we are able to directly observe the evolution of anionic intermediates and determined that two distinct mechanistic pathways lead to the observed site selectivity: (1) the C4&#8208;H within 2,6&#8208;disubstituted pyridines could be removed directly and (2) the C4 selectivity of unsubstituted pyridine originates from the intermolecular exchange of metalation sites via a thermodynamic pathway.

         <title>Asymmetric gem&#8208;Hydroboration and gem&#8208;Hydrogenation of Ynamides: A New Gateway to Chiral Fischer Carbene Complexes and their Catalytic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
gem&#8208;Hydrogenation and gem&#8208;hydroboration of alkynes are highly unorthodox transformations, but asymmetric such gem&#8208;addition reactions are unprecedented. They have now been achieved with excellent levels of regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity using ynamides carrying an Evans oxazolidinone as the substrates. The resulting pianostool ruthenium carbenes were fully characterized and could even be engaged in catalytic downstream reactions.

Ynamides, when reacted with H2 or HBpin in the presence of [Cp*RuCl]4, convert into chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal Fischer carbenes by regioselective gem&#8208;hydrogenation or gem&#8208;hydroboration of the polarized triple bond, respectively. gem&#8208;Hydroboration concomitantly affords a carbogenic borylated stereocenter adjacent to the ruthenium carbene unit, the configuration of which can be controlled using an Evans auxiliary. These are the first examples of asymmetric gem&#8208;addition reactions to alkynes known in the literature; representative pianostool ruthenium carbene complexes formed by this unconventional route were characterized by crystallographic and spectroscopic means. They undergo various stoichiometric reactions and can even entertain catalytic asymmetric transformations, such as hydrogenative cyclopropanations or a novel type of borylative cycloisomerization.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-Hydrogenation and &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-hydroboration of alkynes are highly unorthodox transformations, but asymmetric such &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-addition reactions are unprecedented. They have now been achieved with excellent levels of regio- and stereoselectivity using ynamides carrying an Evans oxazolidinone as the substrates.

         <title>Interfacial Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;Copper Pair Sites on Inverse CeO2/Cu Catalyst Enable Efficient CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol in Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interfacial oxygen vacancy&#8208;neighboring Cu pair sites are identified as the active sites for CO2 electroreduction to ethanol under acidic conditions. By maximizing the density of active pair sites, a high Faradaic efficiency of 48.5&#8201;% and a partial current density of 344.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for ethanol production are achieved over the inverse CeO2/Cu catalyst.







Abstract
Renewable electricity&#8208;driven electrochemical reduction of CO2 offers a promising route for the production of high&#8208;value ethanol. However, the current state of this technology is hindered by low selectivity and productivity, primarily due to a limited understanding of the atomic&#8208;level active sites involved in ethanol formation. Herein, we identify that the interfacial oxygen vacancy&#8208;neighboring Cu (Ov&#8208;Cu) pair sites are the active sites for CO2 electroreduction to ethanol. A linear correlation between the density of Ov&#8208;Cu pair sites and ethanol productivity is experimentally evidenced. Moreover, a high Faradaic efficiency of 48.5&#8201;% and a partial current density of 344.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for ethanol production are achieved over the inverse CeO2/Cu catalyst with a high density of Ov&#8208;Cu pair sites in acid. Mechanistic studies that combine density functional theory calculations and spectroscopic techniques propose an Ov&#8208;involved mechanism where interfacial Ov sites directly activate and dissociate CO2 into *CO in a thermodynamically spontaneous manner, thus favoring the subsequent *CHO formation and asymmetric CHO&#8208;CO coupling. Besides, the asymmetric Ov&#8208;Cu pair sites could preferentially stabilize the *CH2CHOH intermediate, resulting in the favorable formation of ethanol over ethylene. Our findings provide new atomic&#8208;level insights into CO2 electroreduction to ethanol, paving the way for the rational design of future catalysts.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Reductive Coupling of Imines and Internal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reductive coupling of imines with internal alkynes is reported for the first time. Tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted chiral allylamines were synthesized in high yields and excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. Experimental and computational studies show that an in situ cobalt(I) catalyst drives oxidative cyclization. Zinc acts as an electron source and a transmetallating agent for catalyst turnover.







Abstract
Chiral allylamines are important structural components in natural products, pharmaceuticals, and chiral catalysts. Herein, we report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reductive coupling of imines with internal alkynes to synthesize chiral allylamines. The reaction is catalyzed by a cobalt complex derived from commercially available bisphosphine ligand utilizing zinc as the electron donor. The substrate scope is extensive. Symmetric and unsymmetric alkyl and aryl alkynes have been successfully coupled with various imines derived from aryl and alkyl aldehydes. Tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted allyl amines were isolated in high yields, with enantiomeric excess surpassing &gt;99.9&#8201;% and regioselectivities exceeding &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1. These chiral allyl amines can serve as versatile platforms for subsequent transformations while preserving their stereochemical integrity. Extensive experimental and computational mechanistic studies were performed to elucidate the mechanism. These investigations have indicated that an in situ cobalt(I) catalyst enables the oxidative cyclization of alkynes and imines, and a spin crossover occurs during the enantio&#8208;determining step. Zinc plays a pivotal role in facilitating the transmetallation of the resulting azacobaltacycle. The observed enantioselectivity was interpreted by the stabilization of the transition state through higher stabilizing interaction energy from high negative polarization, dispersion, and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions.

         <title>Engineering Lattice Dislocations of TiO2 Support of PdZn&#8722;ZnO Dual&#8208;Site Catalysts to Boost CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By engineering lattice dislocations of TiO2 support, a dual&#8208;site catalyst with a synergistic combination of highly alloyed PdZn and hydroxyl&#8208;/oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich ZnO was developed for efficient CO2 hydrogenation, achieving the selective and robust methanol synthesis performance (9028.0&#8197;mgMeOH gPd+Zn&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) via deviating the reaction routes from the carboxylate pathway to formate pathway.







Abstract
CO2 hydrogenation to methanol using green hydrogen derived from renewable resources provides a promising method for sustainable carbon cycle but suffers from high selectivity towards byproduct CO. Here, we develop an efficient PdZn&#8722;ZnO/TiO2 catalyst by engineering lattice dislocation structures of TiO2 support. We discover that this modification orders irregularly arranged atoms in TiO2 to stabilize crystal lattice, and consequently weakens electronic interactions with supported active phases. It facilitates the transformation of metallic Pd into PdZn alloy, effectively suppressing CO production through inhibiting the reverse water&#8208;gas shift reaction mediated by the carboxylate pathway on Pd0 sites. Moreover, it enables the efficient transfer of hydrogen species via hydrogen spillover from PdZn alloy to ZnO for compensating the poor hydrogen dissociation ability of ZnO, thereby creating both more oxygen vacancies essential for CO2 activation and a hydroxyl&#8208;rich environment conducive to hydrogenation of intermediates. These collective modifications on PdZn&#8722;ZnO dual sites synergistically induce the propensity of the formate pathway for methanol synthesis. Consequently, compared to the unmodified catalyst, our as&#8208;designed catalyst increases methanol selectivity from 64.2 to 80.0&#8201;%, reduces CO selectivity from 35.0 to 19.8&#8201;%, and achieves an impressive methanol space&#8208;time yield of 9028.0&#8197;mgMeOH gPd+Zn&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at a similar CO2 conversion (~8.0&#8201;%).

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks with Carbon&#8208;Centered Radical Sites for Promoting the 4e&#8722; Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks with well&#8208;defined, stable carbon&#8208;centered radical sites were prepared by a facile post&#8208;oxidation process. The redox&#8208;active carbon radical sites demonstrated outstanding catalytic activity in promoting the 4e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway and greatly suppressing the 2e&#8722; pathway, thus contributing to safer and more sustainable fuel cell and metal&#8208;air battery applications.







Abstract
Radical covalent organic frameworks (RCOFs) have demonstrated significant potential in redox catalysis and energy conversion applications.

         <title>Regulation of TADF by Internal and External Heavy Atom Effect in D&#8208;A MOF for Heterocrystal based Temperature&#8208;Compensated Photonic Device</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facilely tunable through&#8208;space charge transfer thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) was realized by synergy of internal and external heavy atom effect induced by decorated &#8208;Br on different components in donor&#8208;acceptor metal&#8211;organic frameworks (D&#8722;A MOFs). Photonic temperature compensated device based on heterocrystal was fabricated through integrating D&#8722;A MOFs with contrary tendency of temperature&#8208;dependent emission intensity, indicating a potential paradigm in photonic integrated circuits (PICs).







Abstract
The application of temperature&#8208;compensated photonic device is hampered by poor accuracy and overly simplistic functions of propagation in photonic integrated circuits (PICs) field. Herein, we report a new library of donor&#8208;acceptor metal&#8211;organic framework (D&#8722;A MOF) with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and the fabricating of temperature&#8208;compensated photonic device by virtue of the unique temperature response character of TADF emitters. Highly tunable through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) of TADF was realized within the D&#8722;A MOFs through a novel strategy that synergistically combines the internal heavy atom effect (HAE) with an external HAE, induced by the incorporation of heavy atoms into different components, achieving the regulable photophysical indicators including adjustable PL wavelength (534 to 592&#8197;nm) and surging quantum yield (5.02&#8201;%&#8211;47.39&#8201;%). Further investigation of the impact of external HAE on TADF was conducted through crystal structures and Hirshfeld surface plots of four D&#8722;A regimes featuring substituent&#8208;based linkers. Notably, temperature&#8208;compensated photonic device based on heterocrystal was fabricated through integrating D&#8722;A MOFs with contrary temperature response. The emission signal output of the heterojunction remained nearly stable in 215&#8197;K to 295&#8197;K range, highlighting the promising potential application of TADF D&#8722;A MOF featuring sensitive temperature response in PICs field.

         <title>Vesicle&#8208;Encapsulated Chemosensing Ensembles Allow Monitoring of Transmembrane Uptake Coupled with Enzymatic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have encapsulated a host&#8211;guest reporter pair together with three enzymes within vesicles to monitor a two&#8208;compartment cascade reaction which includes transmembrane transport of peptide substrates and their subsequent enzymatic conversion inside the vesicles. Our &#8220;protocell&#8221; system mimics a simplistic cellular uptake&#8208;metabolism cycle. To reflect the various mechanisms of nutrient uptake by cells, we studied the uptake of different analytes by means of pore&#8208;forming proteins, amphiphilic transmembrane carriers, and direct bilayer permeation.







Abstract
Compartmentalized models with coupled catalytic networks are considered as &#8220;protocells&#8221; in the context of research related to the origin of life. To model the kinetics of a simple cellular uptake&#8208;metabolism process, we use a compartmentalized protocell system that combines liposome&#8208;encapsulated intravesicular reporter pairs with co&#8208;encapsulated enzymes to monitor the membrane transport of a substrate (analyte uptake) and its subsequent enzymatic reaction inside the vesicles (metabolism to the product). The intravesicular chemosensing ensembles consist of the macrocycles cucurbit[7]uril or p&#8208;sulfonatocalix[4]arene and matching fluorescent dyes to set up suitable reporter pairs. When these macrocycle/dye reporter pairs are co&#8208;encapsulated with enzymes (trypsin, protein kinase A, or butyrylcholinesterase), it is possible to monitor first the transport of different substrates (polylysine, protamine, H&#8208;LRRWSLG&#8208;OH, or butyrylcholine) through added pores (outer membrane proteins F and C), with synthetic carriers (amphiphilic calixarenes), or by direct permeation (only for butyrylcholine). The subsequent enzymatic conversions of the substrates after they have entered the corresponding protocells can be monitored as consecutive reactions. The new type of in vitro assays can be applied to different enzymes and analytes, affording a comprehensive chemosensing system of high chemical complexity.

         <title>Intensifying Interfacial Reverse Hydrogen Spillover for Boosted Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni3N nanosheet array intimately decorated with Cu nanoclusters is proposed for remarkably boosted NO3RR. Benefiting from strengthened reverse hydrogen spillover effect via elegantly engineering the Ni3N/Cu heterointerface, *H generated from Ni3N can rapidly transfer to Cu site through Ni&#8722;N&#8722;Cu bridge bond for deoxygenation/hydrogenation steps, thus delivering a prominent NO3RR performance, favorably presenting the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art level.







Abstract
Rational regulation of active hydrogen (*H) behavior is crucial for advancing electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) to ammonia (NH3), yet in&#8208;depth understanding of the *H generation, transfer, and utilization remains ambiguous, and explorations for *H dynamic optimization are urgently needed. Herein we engineer a Ni3N nanosheet array intimately decorated with Cu nanoclusters (NF/Ni3N&#8722;Cu) for remarkably boosted NO3RR. From comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigations, the Ni3N moieties favors water dissociation to generate *H, and then *H can rapidly transfer to the Cu via unique reverse hydrogen spillover mediating interfacial Ni&#8722;N&#8722;Cu bridge bond, thus increasing *H coverage on the Cu site for subsequent deoxygenation/hydrogenation. More impressively, such intriguing reverse hydrogen spillover effect can be further strengthened via elegant engineering of the Ni3N/Cu heterointerface with more intimate contact. Consequently, the NF/Ni3N&#8722;Cu with Cu nanoclusters intimate anchoring presents record NH3 yield rate of 1.19&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and Faradaic efficiency of 98.7&#8201;% at &#8722;0.3&#8197;V vs. RHE, being on par with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ones. Additionally, with NF/Ni3N&#8722;Cu as the cathode, a high&#8208;performing Zn&#8722;NO3&#8722; battery can be assembled. This contribution illuminates a novel pathway to optimize *H behavior via distinct reverse hydrogen spillover for promoted NO3RR and other hydrogenation reactions.

         <dc:description>
To address the challenge of limited Li+ mobility in traditional molten salt, which hinders the prelithiation and regeneration of spent cathodes, we present an organic/inorganic LiOH&#8208;LiNO3&#8208;LiC7H5O2 molten salt system that promotes rapid Li+ transport to the cathode surface via a quasi&#8208;Grotthuss topochemistry mechanism. Simulations reveal the incorporation of benzoic acid lithium salt (BAL) facilitates this quasi&#8208;Grotthuss pathway, enabling swift Li+ transport and thereby achieving effictive repair and regeneration of spent cathodes.







Abstract
Direct regeneration of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries offers economic benefits and a reduced CO2 footprint. Surface prelithiation, particularly through the molten salt method, is critical in enhancing spent cathode repair during high&#8208;temperature annealing. However, the sluggish Li+ transport kinetics, which predominantly relies on thermally driven processes in the traditional molten salt methods, limit the prelithiation efficiency and regeneration of spent cathodes. Here, we introduce a special molecular configuration (benzoate) into molten salts that facilitates rapid Li+ transport to the surface of LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM) via a quasi&#8208;Grotthuss topochemistry mechanism. This approach effectively avoids the phase transitions that could adversely degrade the electrochemical performance due to insufficient lithiation during the repair process. Computational and experimental analyses reveal that the system enables fast Li+ migration through the topological hopping of benzoate in organic lithium salt, rather than relying solely on thermally driven diffusion, thereby significantly improving the prelithiation and repair efficiency of spent NCM cathodes. Benefiting from the quasi&#8208;Grotthuss Li+ topochemistry transport, the degraded structure and Li vacancies in the spent cathode are effectively eliminated, yieding the regenerated cathode with good cycling stability comparable to commercial counterparts. The proposed Li+ transport mechanism presents a promising route for the efficient and sustainable regeneration of spent cathodes.

         <title>Optimizing Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction via Modulation Doping in Van der Waals Layered Iridium Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>

An acid&#8208;resistant niobium doped Van der Waals layered edge&#8208;sharing 1&#8197;T&#8208;phase IrO2, has been successfully created, which exhibits excellent catalytic stability under the current density of 1.2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a voltage of 1.7&#8197;V for 50&#8197;days PEMWE testing. Mechanism investigation reveals that doping Nb changes the potential&#8208;determining step (PDS) from the *OOH deprotonation process to the *O&#8722;OH coupling process and regulate the binding strength of the intermediates.







Abstract
Anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) exhibits a sluggish four&#8208;electron transfer process, necessitating catalysts with exceptional catalytic activity to enhance its kinetic rate. Van der Waals layered oxides are ideal materials for catalyst design, yet its stability for acidic OER remains large obstacle. Doping provides a crucial way to improve the activity and stability simultaneously. However, doping in Van der Waals layered oxides remains a great challenge since it easily leads to lattice distortion or even the crystal structure damage. In this work, we successfully doping acid&#8208;resistant niobium (Nb) into Van der Waals layered edge&#8208;shared 1T phase iridium oxide (1&#8197;T&#8208;IrO2) via alkali&#8208;assisted thermal method. 1&#8197;T&#8208;IrO2 with a 5&#8201;% Nb doping (Nb0.05Ir0.95O2) only required an overpotential of 191&#8197;mV to achieve a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4, 56&#8197;mV lower than that of 1T&#8208;IrO2. When applied in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer, Nb0.05Ir0.95O2 show stable operation at a high current density of 1.2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for over 50&#8197;days. Density functional theory calculation reveals that doping Nb changes the potential&#8208;determining step from the *OOH deprotonation process in 1&#8197;T&#8208;IrO2 to the *O&#8722;OH coupling process in Nb0.05Ir0.95O2.

         <title>Vacancy&#8208;Activated B&#8208;Doping for Efficient 2e&#8722; Oxygen Reduction through Suppressing H2O2 Decomposition at High Overpotential</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>

In this paper, boron&#8208;active functional groups are introduced via vacancy activation to effectively tune the adsorption strength of the *OOH intermediate and the H2O2 product. This approach enhances the selectivity of the 2e&#8722; ORR and facilitates the timely desorption of H2O2, preventing its further decomposition on the catalyst surface, thereby enabling efficient H2O2 production under high current density conditions.







Abstract
The production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) has emerged as a more environmentally friendly alternative to the traditional anthraquinone method. Although oxidized carbon catalysts have intensive developed due to their high selectivity and activity, the yield and conversion rate of H2O2 under high overpotential still limited. The produced H2O2 was rapidly consumed by the increased intensity of H2O2 reduction, which could ascribe to decomposition of peroxide radicals under high voltage in the carbon catalyst. To overcome this issue, a B doped carbon have been developed to catalyze 2e&#8722; ORR with high efficient through suppressing H2O2 decomposition at high potential. Thus, thermal reducing of oxygen containing groups (OCGs) on graphite could construct defects and vacancies, which in situ convert to B&#8722;Cx subunits on the edge of graphene sheets. The introduction of B&#8722;Cx effectively prevented the decomposition of the *O&#8722;O bond and provided suitable adsorption capacity for *OOH, achieving excellent selectivity for the 2e&#8722; ORR across a wide voltage range. Finally, a remarkable H2O2 yield of 7.91&#8197;mmol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 was delivered at an industrial current density of 600&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which could provide &#8220;green&#8221; pathway for scale&#8208;upable synthesis H2O2.

         <title>Autocatalytic Interfacial Synthesis of Self&#8208;Standing Amide&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal two&#8208;step method based on autocatalytic interfacial polymerization (AIP) has enabled the synthesis of irreversibly amide&#8208;linked COF (AmCOF) membranes with Turing structures. The representative AmCOF&#8208;1 membrane with its built&#8208;in robust amide knots exhibits a good performance for H2O2 photosynthesis (4353&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and high stability, enabling continuous production of H2O2 under sunlight for 150&#8197;h without sacrificial agents.







Abstract
The synthesis of crystalline covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has in principle relied on reversible dynamic chemistry. A general method to synthesize irreversibly bonded COFs is urgently demanded for driving the COF chemistry to a new era. Here we report a universal two&#8208;step method for the straightforward synthesis of irreversibly amide&#8208;linked COF (AmCOF) membranes by autocatalytic interfacial polymerization (AIP). Highly crystalline amide and imine bilinker COF (AICOF) membranes are readily synthesized by AIP strategy which ingeniously leverages interfacial polymerization to generate amide units followed by an autocatalytic condensation that forms imine bonds. Then, the fully amide&#8208;linked AmCOF membranes with Turing structures can be prepared through irreversible linker renovation. The universality of this method has been exemplified by nine AmCOF membranes. Among them, the AmCOF&#8208;1 membrane exhibits superior performance for H2O2 photosynthesis (4353&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and high stability, enabling continuous production of H2O2 under sunlight for 150&#8197;h without sacrificial agents. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the greatly improved properties are attributable to the built&#8208;in robust amide knots, facilitating full separation of electrons and holes, ultra&#8208;long exciton diffusion length, and fast dissociation of excitons within the AmCOF channels.

Here we report a universal two-step method for the straightforward synthesis of irreversibly amide-linked COF (AmCOF) membranes by autocatalytic interfacial polymerization (AIP). Highly crystalline amide and imine bilinker COF (AICOF) membranes are readily synthesized by AIP strategy which ingeniously leverages interfacial polymerization to generate amide units followed by an autocatalytic condensation that forms imine bonds. Then, the fully amide-linked AmCOF membranes with Turing structures can be prepared through irreversible linker renovation. The universality of this method has been exemplified by nine AmCOF membranes. Among them, the AmCOF-1 membrane exhibits superior performance for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photosynthesis (4353&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and high stability, enabling continuous production of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under sunlight for 150&#8197;h without sacrificial agents. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the greatly improved properties are attributable to the built-in robust amide knots, facilitating full separation of electrons and holes, ultra-long exciton diffusion length, and fast dissociation of excitons within the AmCOF channels.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>

Multifunctional potential well&#8208;type Bi2Te3/TiO2 heterojunction is constructed with the superiority of mass transport, polysulfides capture and conversion. These enable a significantly improved electrochemical performance of Li&#8722;S batteries, a high area capacity of 11.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and acceptable cycling stability are realized even with the high sulfur loading of 13.2&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and low E/S ratio of 3.8&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1.







Abstract
The heterojunction materials are considered as promising electrocatalyst candidates that empower advanced lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries. However, the detailed functional mechanism of heterojunction materials to boost the sulfur redox reaction kinetics remains unclear. Herein, we construct a multifunctional potential well&#8208;type Bi2Te3/TiO2 topological insulator (TI) heterojunction with electric dipole domain to elucidate the synergistic mechanism, which facilitates rapid mass transport, strengthens polysulfide capture ability and accelerates polysulfide conversion. Therefore, the Li&#8722;S battery with Bi2Te3/TiO2 TI heterojunction modified separator achieves high utilization of sulfur cathode, delivering a high reversible specific capacity of 1375&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C and long cycling capability with a negligible capacity decay of 0.022&#8201;% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1&#8197;C. Even with the high sulfur loading of 13.2&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and low E/S ratio of 3.8&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1, a high area capacity of 11.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and acceptable cycling stability can be obtained. This work provides guidance for designing high&#8208;efficiency TI heterojunctions to promote the practical application of Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Bridged S&#8722;N&#8722;Cu Sites for CO2 Photoreduction to Ethanol with 99.5&#8201;% Selectivity in Pure Water</title>

A red polymer carbon nitride consisting of S&#8722;N and Cu&#8722;N4 dual active sites is designed to achieve an impressive ethanol evolution rate of 50.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with 99.5&#8201;% selectivity for CO2 photoreduction in pure water.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to ethanol is extremely challenging due to the limited efficiency of charge separation, sluggish kinetics of C&#8722;C coupling, and unfavorable formation of oxygenate intermediates. Here, we elaborately design a red polymer carbon nitride (RPCN) consisting of S&#8722;N and Cu&#8722;N4 dual active sites (Cu/S&#8208;RPCN) to address this challenge, which achieves an impressive ethanol evolution rate of 50.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with 99.5&#8201;% selectivity for CO2 photoreduction in pure water. Cu and S atoms within the Cu&#8722;N&#8722;S configuration can serve as trapping centers for electrons and holes, respectively, providing spatial separation for photogenerated charge carriers. The incorporation of S atoms optimizes the adsorption of *CO on Cu atoms and reduces the energy barrier for the formation of *CO&#8722;COH intermediate. The adsorption strength of *OCHCH2OH intermediate on the Cu atoms via the O&#8722;Cu&#8722;C configuration can affect the selectivity of the C2 products as the cleavage of the Cu&#8722;O/Cu&#8722;C bonds determines the ethanol/ethylene pathway. The S&#8722;N&#8722;Cu structure weakens the Cu&#8722;O bond, thereby promoting the production of ethanol. This work provides a novel approach to fine&#8208;tune the surrounding microenvironment of metal atoms on carbon nitride for highly effective photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to ethanol.

An electrolyte design strategy based on a partially fluorinated ester is rationally proposed to achieve a balance between low desolvation energy, fast Li+ transport, high interfacial stability, and superior thermal stability. This strategy endows the stable operation of ultra&#8208;high voltage (4.7&#8197;V) and ultra&#8208;wide temperature (&#8722;30 to 70&#8201;&#176;C) LiCO2 batteries, enhancing their energy density and operating temperature range simultaneously.







Abstract
LiCoO2 batteries for 3&#8197;C electronics demand high charging voltage and wide operating temperature range, which are virtually impossible for existing electrolytes due to aggravated interfacial parasitic reactions and sluggish kinetics. Herein, we report an electrolyte design strategy based on a partially fluorinated ester solvent (i.e., DFEA) that achieves a balance between weak Li+&#8208;solvent interactions, sufficient salt dissociation, high interfacial stability, and superior thermal stability to address the aforementioned challenges. The resulting high&#8208;voltage wide&#8208;temperature electrolyte (HWE) not only possesses low desolvation energy, fast Li+ transport, high oxidation stability, excellent thermal&#8208;abuse tolerance and non&#8208;flammability, but also enables the formation of both inorganic&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Owing to the above merits, this HWE endows the highly stable operation of LiCoO2 cathodes under an ultra&#8208;high voltage of 4.7&#8197;V and Graphite&#8201;||&#8201;LiCoO2 batteries in an ultra&#8208;wide temperature range of &#8722;30 to 70&#8201;&#176;C. Meanwhile, a 1.7&#8197;Ah&#8208;level 4.6&#8197;V Graphite&#8201;||&#8201;LiCoO2 pouch cell with a high energy density of 240&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 also delivers excellent cycling stability, representing a significant advancement in the design of electrolytes towards ultra&#8208;high voltage and ultra&#8208;wide temperature batteries.

NiNCs@Ni&#8208;Nx strengthening electrochemical CO2RR&#8208;to&#8208;CO. A comprehensive DFT calculation was performed to explore the effect of Ni nanoclusters on Ni&#8208;Nx (x=1,2,3,4) SACs and guided the successful synthesis of Ni6@Ni&#8208;N3 catalyst with high FECO (99.7&#8201;%) and TOF (83984.2&#8197;h&#8722;1) during CO2RR. The Ni6 nanoclusters can stabilize the unsaturated Ni&#8208;N3 sites and optimize the *COOH intermediate adsorption.







Abstract
Unsaturated Ni single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), Ni&#8208;Nx (x=1,2,3), have been investigated to break the conventional Ni&#8208;N4 structural limitation and provide more unoccupied 3d orbitals for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) intermediates adsorption, but their intrinsically low structural stability has seriously hindered their applications. Here, we developed a strategy by integrating Ni nanoclusters to stabilize unsaturated Ni&#8208;N3 atomic sites for efficient CO2 electroreduction to CO at industrial&#8208;level current. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the incorporation of Ni nanocluster effectively stabilizes the unsaturated Ni&#8208;N3 atomic sites and modulates their electronic structure to enhance the adsorption of the key intermediate *COOH during CO2RR. Guided by these insights, we prepared an optimal composite catalyst, Ni6@Ni&#8208;N3, which features a Ni6N6 nanocluster surrounded by six Ni&#8208;N3 single atoms sites, through low&#8208;temperature pyrolysis. The morphology and coordinative structure of Ni6@Ni&#8208;N3 were confirmed by an aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscope (AC&#8208;TEM) and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). As a result, Ni6@Ni&#8208;N3 demonstrated a remarkably high CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 99.7&#8201;% and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 83984.2&#8197;h&#8722;1 at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 under &#8722;1.15&#8197;VRHE, much better than those of Ni&#8208;N4 with a lower FECO of 86&#8201;% at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a TOF of 39309.9&#8197;h&#8722;1under identical potential. XAS analyses of Ni6@Ni&#8208;N3 before and after long&#8208;term CO2RR testing confirmed the excellent stability of its coordinative environment. This work highlights a generalizable approach for stabilizing unsaturated single&#8208;atom catalysts, paving the way for their application in high&#8208;performance CO2RR.

         <title>g&#8208;C3N4 S&#8208;Scheme Homojunction through Van der Waals Interface Regulation by Intrinsic Polymerization Tailoring for Enhanced Photocatalytic H2 Evolution and CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A g&#8208;C3N4 homojunction with strong internal interfacial Van der Waals interactions is constructed via in&#8197;situ supramolecular thermal polycondensation. Due to the inherent difference of 0D nanodots and 2D nanoplate, g&#8208;C3N4 bandgap is regulated to realize the construction of S&#8208;Scheme heterojunction, improving the carrier separation efficiency and boosting photocatalytic performance. This finding is crucial for the design of g&#8208;C3N4 homojunction.







Abstract
The effective S&#8208;scheme homojunction relies on the precise regulation of band structure and construction of advantaged charge migration interfaces. Here, the electronic structural properties of g&#8208;C3N4 were modulated through meticulous polymerization of self&#8208;assembled supramolecular precursors. Experimental and DFT results indicate that both the intrinsic bandgap and surface electronic characteristics were adjusted, leading to the formation of an in&#8208;situ reconstructed homojunction interface facilitated by intrinsic van der Waals forces. The homojunction catalyst, composed of g&#8208;C3N4 nanodots and ultra&#8208;thin g&#8208;C3N4 nanoflakes, exhibited a significant S&#8208;scheme carrier separation mechanism, which enhances the utilization of electrons and holes. Consequently, under AM 1.5 light irradiation (~100&#8197;mW/cm2), the g&#8208;C3N4 homojunction photocatalyst achieved a remarkable hydrogen evolution rate of 580&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1. Furthermore, a reversed CH4 selectivity in CO2 reduction was observed, yielding 80.30&#8197;&#956;mol&#8197;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of 96.86&#8201;%, in contrast to the performance of bulk g&#8208;C3N4, which produced only 2.22&#8197;&#956;mol&#8197;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with the 15.69&#8201;% CH4 selectivity. These findings not only highlight the significant potential of the g&#8208;C3N4 homojunction photocatalyst for hydrogen production and CO2 reduction but also propose a superior and effective strategy for optimizing the structural properties of g&#8208;C3N4, which are crucial for the design of photocatalytic reactions.

Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the smartest of them all? The combination of B(C6F5)3 with a 1,2,3&#8208;triazole unleashed remarkable new possibilities, as reported by Biprajit Sarkar et al. in their Research Article (e202422702). The mirror images show the three different compounds to which the starting material can convert to: a strongly donating anionic mesoionic carbene ligand (MIC), metallo&#8208;MIC&#8208;borane adducts and bis&#8208;borane adducts of MICs. This simple yet astonishing concept provides a platform for new, intriguing MIC&#8208;based compounds with high potential in catalysis.

         <title>Outside Back Cover: Conduction Band and Defect Engineering for the Prominent Visible&#8208;Light Responsive Photocatalysts</title>

To enhance H&#8322; evolution via water splitting, preventing deep electron traps&#8212;&#8208;often formed by anion vacancies&#8212;&#8208;is essential. Transient IR absorption spectroscopy reveals that 2D layered materials like Bi&#8324;NbOCl rarely form such traps. This is due to the formation of a defect&#8208;tolerant, bonding&#8208;based conduction band minimum, which effectively suppresses deep traps while maintaining high electron reactivity. Addressing this issue has been a major focus in photocatalysis research, as reported by Akira Yamakata, Takafumi Ogawa, and Hiroshi Kageyama et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202419624).

The dimerization of a lantern&#8208;shaped Pd2L4 coordination cage yields two Pd4L8 catenanes with distinct topologies: a &#8220;classic&#8221; quadruply interlocked D4&#8208;symmetric structure and a newly discovered triply linked motif with C2h symmetry. The latter is stabilized by extensive non&#8208;covalent interligand contacts, opening a strategy to control the degree of mechanical interlocking, tuned by temperature and anion exchange, as reported by Guido H. Clever et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202423810).

         <title>Expediting Glycospace Exploration: Therapeutic Glycans via Automated Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of well&#8208;defined carbohydrates constitutes a nexus in glycoscience, but few conceptual paradigms have shaped the field as much as automated glycan synthesis. This minireview describes the structural diversity and function of glycans generated by automated glycan synthesis platforms over the last five years. The translational impact of these advances, their limitations and future perspective are discussed.







Abstract
Glycans regulate a vast spectrum of disease&#8208;related processes, yet effectively leveraging these important mediators in a therapeutic context remains a frontier in contemporary medicine. Unlike many other classes of clinically important biopolymers, carbohydrates derive from discrete biosynthetic pathways and are not produced directly from genes. The conspicuous absence of a biological blueprint to achieve amplification creates a persistent challenge in obtaining well&#8208;defined glycostructures for therapeutic translation. Isolating purified sugars from biological sources is not without challenge, rendering synthetic organic chemistry the nexus of this advancing field. Chemical synthesis has proven to be an unfaltering pillar in the production of complex glycans, but laborious syntheses coupled with purification challenges frequently introduce reproducibility issues. In an effort to reconcile these preparative challenges with the societal importance of glycans, automated glycan synthesis was conceptualised at the start of the 21st century. This rapidly expanding, multifaceted field of scientific endeavor has effectively merged synthetic chemistry with technology and engineering to expedite the precision synthesis of target glycans. This minireview describes the structural diversity and function of glycans generated by automated glycan synthesis platforms over the last five years. The translational impact of these advances is discussed together with current limitations and future directions.

         <title>Antimicrobial Phenolic Materials: From Assembly to Function</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural polyphenols, primarily found in plants, can possess antimicrobial properties and have therefore been exploited widely. This review examines the antimicrobial mechanisms of polyphenols and their development into antimicrobial materials, including as particles, hydrogels, coatings and macroscopic structures. These materials hold potential for antimicrobial applications, ranging from wound healing to oral health, and offer a promising therapeutic strategy for combating and reducing the transmission of bacterial infections.







Abstract
Infectious diseases pose considerable challenges to public health, particularly with the rise of multidrug&#8208;resistant pathogens that globally cause high mortality rates. These pathogens can persist on surfaces and spread in public and healthcare settings. Advances have been made in developing antimicrobial materials to reduce the transmission of pathogens, including materials composed of naturally sourced polyphenols and their derivatives, which exhibit antimicrobial potency, broad&#8208;spectrum activity, and a lower likelihood of promoting resistance. This review provides an overview of recent advances in the fabrication of antimicrobial phenolic biomaterials, where natural phenolic compounds act as active antimicrobial agents or encapsulate other antimicrobial agents (e.g., metal ions, antimicrobial peptides, natural biopolymers). Various forms of phenolic biomaterials synthesized through these two strategies, including antimicrobial particles, capsules, hydrogels, and coatings, are summarized, with a focus on their application in wound healing, bone repair and regeneration, oral health, and antimicrobial coatings for medical devices. The potential of these advanced phenolic biomaterials provides a promising therapeutic approach for combating antimicrobial&#8208;resistant infections and reducing microbial transmission.

         <title>Tuning Atomically Dispersed Metal Sites in Nanozymes for Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>

Tuning nanozymes with atomically dispersed metal sites efficiently enhances their catalytic activity and specificity, and multifunctionality by optimizing the electronic and geometric structures. Taking advantage of unique properties, these advanced nanozymes hold great promise in sensing applications, achieving the goals of high detection sensitivity, selectivity, and accuracy.







Abstract
Nanozymes with atomically dispersed metal sites (ADzymes), especially single&#8208;atom nanozymes, have attracted widespread attention in recent years due to their unique advantages in mimicking the active sites of natural enzymes. These nanozymes not only maximize exposure of catalytic sites but also possess superior catalytic activity performance, achieving challenging catalytic reactions. These advantages position ADzymes as highly promising candidates in the field of sensing and biosensing. This review summarizes the classification and properties of ADzymes, systematically highlighting some typical regulation strategies involving central metal, coordination environment, etc., to achieve their catalytical activity, specificity, and multifunctionality. Then, we present the recent advances of ADzymes in different sensing fields, including colorimetry, fluorescence, electrochemistry, chemiluminescence, photoelectrochemistry, and electrochemiluminescence. Taking advantage of their unique catalytic performance, the resultant ADzymes show great potential in achieving the goal of sensitivity, selectivity and accuracy for the detection of various targets. Specifically, the underlying mechanisms in terms of signal amplification were discussed in detail. Finally, the current challenges and perspectives on the development of advanced ADzymes are discussed.

These nanozymes not only maximize exposure of catalytic sites but also possess superior catalytic activity performance, achieving challenging catalytic reactions. These advantages position ADzymes as highly promising candidates in the field of sensing and biosensing. This review summarizes the classification and properties of ADzymes, systematically highlighting some typical regulation strategies involving central metal, coordination environment, etc., to achieve their catalytical activity, specificity, and multifunctionality. Then, we present the recent advances of ADzymes in different sensing fields, including colorimetry, fluorescence, electrochemistry, chemiluminescence, photoelectrochemistry, and electrochemiluminescence. Taking advantage of their unique catalytic performance, the resultant ADzymes show great potential in achieving the goal of sensitivity, selectivity and accuracy for the detection of various targets. Specifically, the underlying mechanisms in terms of signal amplification were discussed in detail. Finally, the current challenges and perspectives on the development of advanced ADzymes are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Afterglow Copper(I) Iodine Cluster Scintillator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomically precise copper(I) iodine cluster with unique afterglow emission and excellent X&#8208;ray excited luminescence property was constructed, which was successfully used for high resolution X&#8208;ray imaging with an ultrahigh spatial resolution of 23.6&#8197;LP&#8201;mm&#8722;1.







Abstract
Copper(I) iodine clusters have drawn intense attention due to their advantageous photophysical properties, such as a high luminescence efficiency, large Stokes shift, and tunable luminescence lifetimes. In this work, a copper(I) iodine cluster (Cu2I2&#8208;CH3CN) was synthesized, which exhibits unique afterglow emission, ultrahigh quantum yield (90.1&#8201;% in solid state) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behavior. It was found that thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and long&#8208;lifetime phosphorescence occur simultaneously in Cu2I2&#8208;CH3CN. The unique photoluminescence properties of Cu2I2&#8208;CH3CN were attributed to the large spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) and long&#8208;term rigidity of the crystal. The high quantum efficiency, TADF characteristics, and heavy&#8208;atom composition of Cu2I2&#8208;CH3CN endow it with excellent X&#8208;ray excited luminescence (XEL) properties, making it a promising X&#8208;ray scintillator. A flexible scintillator screen made of Cu2I2&#8208;CH3CN was successfully fabricated and used for X&#8208;ray imaging with a spatial resolution of 23.6&#8197;LP&#8201;mm&#8722;1.

         <title>Universal Reagent for Mild and Stereospecific Nucleophilic Substitution of Alcohols with Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A user&#8208;friendly, shelf&#8208;stable protonated betaine reagent (BEHT triflate), derived from Mitsunobu reagents, has been developed to enable the direct displacement of alcohols using primary and secondary amines as nucleophiles. The reaction with chiral, non&#8208;racemic secondary alcohols proceeds with inversion of configuration, allowing for one&#8208;step formation of C&#8722;X bonds (X=N, C, S, O, or halide).







Abstract
A user&#8208;friendly reagent for mild and general activation of alcohols towards bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) leveraging diverse nucleophiles, including primary and secondary amines is reported herein. The new ion&#8208;paired reagent discovery was based upon the putative zwitterionic betaine intermediate of the Mitsunobu reaction and enabled the one&#8208;step conversion of enantioenriched alcohols to valuable chiral C&#8722;X bonds (where X=N, C, S, O or halide). The described activating reagent has also been applied to a one&#8208;step methylation reaction using methanol and to an intermolecular amination/intramolecular cyclization sequence that generates heterocycles, such as tetrahydroisoquinolines. This work provides the first evidence by X&#8208;ray crystallography of a protonated betaine as intermediate in the Mitsunobu reaction.

         <title>Cationic, Iodine(III)&#8208;Mediated and Directed Diastereoselective Oxidation of Inert C&#8722;H Bonds in Cyclic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An I(III)&#8208;mediated, selective oxidation of remote C&#8722;H bonds is reported. This approach relies on the generation of a destabilized carbocation that is coerced into a predetermined position through charge relocation. In&#8208;depth experiments give insight into the mechanistic intricacies of this highly diastereoselective transformation.







Abstract
Over the past three decades, the functionalization of unactivated C&#8722;H bonds has become a workhorse of synthesis. In the field of C&#8722;H bond oxygenation, most established methods hinge on single&#8208;electron reactivity, encountering challenges pertaining to regio&#8208; and/or stereocontrol. Herein, we describe a conceptually distinct strategy relying on the unique features of carbocation chemistry. Our iodine(III)&#8208;mediated method achieves the diastereoselective oxygenation of remote C&#8722;H bonds at traditionally unreactive sites and enables late&#8208;stage functionalization at steroidal frameworks as well as an unusual chirality relay.

         <title>Control of Interlocking Mode in Pd4L8 Cage Catenanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dimerization of Pd2L4 cage leads to formation two distinct Pd4L8 species with different interlocking degree: the classical quadruply interlocked double cage and a novel triply interlocked double cage, representing a previously unreported topology for Pd4L8 complexes. The degree of interlocking and equilibrium in the double cage system can be controlled thermally and through anion exchange.







Abstract
Precise control over the catenation process in interlocked supramolecular systems remains a significant challenge. Here, we report a system in which a lantern&#8208;shaped Pd2L4 cage can dimerize to form two distinct Pd4L8 catenanes with different interlocking degree: a previously described quadruply interlocked double cage motif of D4 symmetry and an unprecedented triply interlocked structure of C2h symmetry. While the former structure features a linear arrangement of four Pd(II) centers, separated by three mechanically linked pockets, the new motif has a staggered shape. Both assemblies are topological isomers, coexisting in equilibrium in solution. The triply interlocked species is thermodynamically more stable due to extended noncovalent interactions between the ligands, as supported by X&#8208;ray structure analysis and electronic structure calculations. Notably, the degree of interlocking in the double cage system can be controlled by a change of temperature and through anion exchange. Cage&#8208;to&#8208;cage transformations were followed by NMR, MS and TIMS methods.

         <title>Aryl Silicon Nucleophiles in Bismuth Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A seminal example of aryl silicon nucleophiles in Bi catalysis is reported, in the context of the synthesis of aromatic fluorinated thiosulfones. The protocol is compatible with a wide range of anionic and neutral Ar&#8208;Si compounds, including heterocycles. Stoichiometric investigations of individual organometallic steps provide strong evidence supporting a Bi&#8208;redox&#8208;neutral catalytic cycle.







Abstract
We present a catalytic protocol utilizing bismuth for the synthesis of aromatic fluorinated thiosulfones, showcasing a seminal example of aryl silicon nucleophiles in Bi catalysis. This catalytic process is enabled by a series of Bi&#8208;based organometallic transformations, including an unprecedented transmetalation of aryl silicates to Bi(III) complexes and the formal migratory insertion of sulfur dioxide (SO2) into the Bi&#8208;C bond. The protocol is compatible with a wide range of anionic and neutral Ar&#8208;Si compounds, including heterocycles. Stoichiometric investigations of individual organometallic steps provide strong evidence supporting a Bi&#8208;redox&#8208;neutral catalytic cycle.

The second known three&#8208;dimensional borosulfate anionic topology demonstrates remarkable adaptability to hosting mono&#8208; and trivalent cations including the very first antimony borosulfates. Distinct one&#8208;dimensional channels accommodate these ions, with varying combinations leading systematically to different space groups. Our initial characterization includes single crystal as well as powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, vibrational spectroscopy and thermal analysis.







Abstract
Recently we reported the synthesis and characterization of Bi(H3O)[B(SO4)2]4, at that time representing only the second tectosilicate analogous borosulfate. Inspired by this structure type, we herein present the first modular system within borosulfate chemistry. MIIIMI[B(SO4)2]4 (MIII=Bi3+, Sb3+, Lu3+; MI=H3O+, NO2+, Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, Cs+) were synthesised under solvothermal conditions and show a large variability towards their mono&#8208; and trivalent cation while retaining the same three&#8208;dimensional anionic network. Based on their combination, the titled compounds crystallize in the tetragonal space groups I

         <title>Dynamic Kinetic Resolution Allows Control of Remote Stereochemistry in Asymmetric Hydrogen Borrowing Alkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of a chiral ligand and a racemic keto&#8208;alcohol starting material allows a hydrogen borrowing cyclisation reaction to form products with both high yields and high enantioselectivity. The excellent yields and enantiomeric purities of the products formed from a racemic starting material are indicative of a dynamic kinetic resolution process involving a base labile cyclohexene intermediate. Finally, the cyclic products can be easily manipulated to a wide range of enantiopure acyl cyclohexanes.







Abstract
A catalytic asymmetric method for the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;substituted ketones via hydrogen borrowing alkylation of both racemic linear precursors and 1,5&#8208;diols is described. The base mediated racemization of an intermediate cyclohexenone to facilitates a dynamic kinetic resolution, affording highly enantioenriched cyclohexanes in excellent yields, which could be further functionalized by removal of the Ph* group. DFT modelling revealed the mode of enantioinduction to be a stepwise process comprising of a hydride transfer and a coordination change to a &#960;&#8208;allylic enolate complex with the iridium catalyst.

         <title>An Organic Crystalline Ternary Pseudo&#8208;Heterojunction with Contrasting Luminescent and Mechanical Properties Prepared by Thermotropic Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ternary pseudo&#8208;heterojunctions containing three organic polymorphs with distinct physical properties were prepared, which introduces new possibilities for integrating multiple functional phases within a single material system.







Abstract
Advancements in crystal engineering have enabled the precise tuning of the physical properties of organic crystals, thereby enhancing their potential in advanced optoelectronics. Here, we design an organic compound which crystallizes into distinct polymorphs with contrasting luminescent and mechanical behaviors. Controlled growth conditions yield flexible (Cry&#8208;O: orange fluorescence) and brittle (Cry&#8208;Y: yellow fluorescence) crystals which exhibit unique fluorescence shifts and reversible spectral changes between room and low temperatures, alongside unidirectional phase transitions upon thermal stimulation. The optical and mechanical differences between the polymorphs O and Y stem from their distinct molecular packing arrangements and intermolecular interactions. Notably, Cry&#8208;O undergoes sequential phase transitions upon heating to 98 and 132&#8201;&#176;C, enabling the creation of a ternary &#8220;pseudo&#8208;heterojunction&#8221; structure, facilitating the integration of multiple functional phases into a single material. These findings not only enhance the understanding of structure&#8211;property relationships of organic materials but also demonstrate the potential of polymorphism&#8208;driven property tuning for optoelectronic devices, thermal management systems, and optical sensors.

         <title>A Mechanochromic Rotaxane that Releases Azetidine&#8208;Trityl&#8208;Maleimide, a Versatile Fluorescent Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanochromic rotaxane capable of releasing azetidine&#8208;trityl&#8208;maleimide (ATM), a new fluorescent probe displaying excellent optical properties (rigidochromic, large Stokes shift, solvent insensitive) and chemical stability (pH, nucleophiles, dienes), is presented. The mechanochemical generation of ATM is only possible with a rotaxane actuator, and this device should find applications in materials and biological science.







Abstract
Force sensing at the molecular level has enabled the study of materials failure and it offers great promises for the investigation of mechanobiological processes. Traditional force probes rely on the reversible or irreversible activation of mechanochromic precursors to assess transient or permanent changes in polymer networks. A promising approach involves force&#8208;controlled release of sensing molecules, as the accumulation of chromic molecules at specific sites would enable the recording of deformation histories. However, many fluorescent probes are limited by environmental sensitivity, specific release conditions, or low release efficiency. Maleimide&#8208;based dyes, especially amino maleimides, offer a robust alternative due to their small size, structural versatility, and tuneable fluorescence properties. Here, we present a mechanochromic rotaxane device that releases an azetidine&#8208;trityl&#8208;maleimide (ATM) fluorescent probe via a retro&#8208;[4+2] cycloaddition reaction. ATM is a rigidochromic, chemically stable, and environmentally insensitive probe, generated exclusively through rotaxane actuation, underscoring the unique mechanochemical properties of rotaxanes. This device holds potential for applications in material science and biology, such as the investigation of polymer networks and active tissues.

         <title>Highly Effective and Durable Integrated&#8208;Chainmail Electrode for H2 Production through H2S Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust integrated electrode that features a dual&#8208;level chainmail structure with graphene encapsulating nickel foam is developed to enhance H2S electrolysis for green hydrogen production. The unique integrated&#8208;chainmail structure significantly improves both the activity and stability of the nickel foam. This chainmail electrodes realizes efficient hydrogen production at a high power of 224&#8197;W with 43&#8201;% electricity consumption reduction.







Abstract
H2S is a prevalent yet toxic gas commonly encountered during fossil fuel extraction, whose electrolysis not only addresses pollution concerns but also facilitates hydrogen production. However, the advancement of H2S electrolysis at high current density has been impeded by the lack of stable and highly active electrodes that can endure the corrosive effects of H2S poisoning. Herein, we present an integrated&#8208;chainmail electrode that features dual&#8208;level chainmail structure with graphene encapsulating nickel foam (Ni@NC foam) to enhance H2S electrolysis. The electrode comprises a primary chainmail, formed by graphene coating on the surface of nickel foam, and a secondary chainmail, created by graphene encapsulating nickel nanoparticles. This integrated&#8208;chainmail structure significantly enhances both the activity and stability of nickel foam, which delivers an industrial&#8208;scale high current density exceeding 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.12&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, above five times higher than nickel foam. Moreover, the Ni@NC foam remains stable over 300&#8197;hours of test, demonstrating a lifespan at least ten times longer than nickel foam. In a demo for H2S removal from simulated natural gas, the Ni@NC foam as the electrodes exhibits a hydrogen production rate of 272&#8197;ml&#8201;min&#8722;1, while reducing electricity consumption by 43&#8201;% compared with traditional water electrolysis.

         <title>A General Strategy for the Synthesis of Metal&#8208;Backboned Molecules with Different Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and general synthetic strategy, incorporating ligand exchange, has been employed to design and synthesize metal&#8208;backboned molecules featuring various of metals. The synthesized metal&#8208;backboned molecules exhibiting intriguing optical characteristics, electronic band gaps and thermal properties. This work provides a new avenue on the synthesis of metal&#8208;backboned molecules with excellent properties.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;backboned molecules have been recently explored as a new class of materials with remarkable physical and chemical properties. However, their backbones are mainly composed of Ni atoms and poses challenges in incorporating a wide range of metallic elemental species, which has severely hindered their further development. Herein, we have designed a general synthesis strategy and obtained new metal&#8208;backboned molecules with a variety of metals including Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag and Pt in the backbones through a ligand&#8208;assisted strategy under screening reaction conditions. The metal backbone with seven Cu atoms has been carefully demonstrated for the synthesis. The intriguing optical properties, electronic band gaps and thermal properties for the metal&#8208;backboned molecules have been further explored. This work provides a new avenue on the synthesis of high&#8208;performance metal&#8208;backboned molecule materials for promising applications in the future.

         <title>Strategy Formulation for Mitigating Capacity Fading of Na&#8208;Layered Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanisms underlying capacity fading during cycling in layered oxide cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries remain inadequately understood. It is essential to elucidate the reasons and propose effective strategies. Here, the capacity fading mechanism of commercial NaFe1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2 is due to the dissolution of iron ions. Additionally, the extraction of sodium ions (after the Fe3+/Fe4+ reaction) lowers the energy level of NaFe1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2 below that of the electrolyte solvent, thereby inducing solvent decomposition. We establish screening criteria for electrolyte additives through theoretical calculations to improve capacity retention. We identified a series of nitrogen&#8208;containing Lewis base additives that can kinetically bind efficiently to iron ions in NaFe1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2 and thermodynamically exhibit stronger electron&#8208;donating abilities than the solvents. A new compound sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (which has not been studied as a Na&#8208;ion battery additive before) is selected through the Reaxys database (out of 61 molecules) because it is commercially available at a low price and is relatively stable in the electrochemical process. Such additive is demonstrated to greatly improve the Coulombic efficiency and reduce the dissolution of iron ions of NaFe1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2//hard carbon cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Substituent modulation of contorted hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;benzocoronene&#8208;based conjugated metal&#8208;organic frameworks for high&#8208;performance capacitor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) exhibiting graphite&#8208;like van der Waals stacked layers have been recognized as a new type of crystalline conductive materials and shown rapid progress in the last decade. However, purposively design and modulation of their conductive properties and related application performance remains challenge. Herein, we present a new type of 2D c&#8208;MOFs with contorted conformation and substituent&#8208;modulated structures for high performance of capacitor. Octahydroxy&#8208;hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;benzocoronene (HBCOH) with a contorted graphene nanosheet core is designed and synthesized as the ligand. The F substituted 2D c&#8208;MOF FHBCOH&#8208;Cu demonstrates superior crystallinity and conductive properties exhibiting a record&#8208;breaking specific capacitance of 943 F g&#8208;1 at a rate of 0.5 A g&#8208;1. The improved crystallinity, enhanced conductivity and pore environment control, enabled by halogen substitution, combined with the contorted conformation synergistically accomplish high performance of 2D c&#8208;MOFs as electrode materials in supercapacitor. This study introduces a novel molecular design strategy for the construction of 2D c&#8208;MOFs&#8208;based high&#8208;performance energy storage materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving Buried Interface/Bulk Synergistic Passivation via Chlorophyll Derivative for Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Buried interfacial engineering is crucial for NiOx&#8208;based invert perovskite solar cells (PSCs), while most passivation measures focus only on the interface and neglect the perovskite bulk. In this work, a stable free&#8208;base chlorin possessing an amino acid terminal (serinyl pyropheophorbide&#8208;a, SPPa) was synthesized as a functional chlorophyll derivative, and its trifluoroacetic acid and hydrogen chloride salts (SPPaX; X = TFA, HCl) were introduced into the NiOx/perovskite interface. Thanks to the high solubility in N,N&#8208;dimethyl formamide and dimethyl sulfoxide, SPPaX can diffuse into the perovskite through the precursor. Insertion of SPPaX optimizes the interfacial energy band bending and minimizes interfacial defects, while the growth sites provided by SPPaX facilitate the formation of high&#8208;quality perovskite film with less lattice strain and high crystal orientation. Additionally, diffused SPPaX molecules in perovskite improve the crystallization process and decrease the internal defects of perovskite films. As a result, the SPPaX distributed throughout perovskite achieves a bulk/interface synergistic passivation effect at both the bulk and buried interface of perovskite film. SPPaTFA&#8208;modified PSCs deliver a champion power conversion efficiency of 25.54% with a superior long&#8208;term stability under both light and thermal stress.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereochemistry at the Single&#8208;Molecule Level: From Monitoring to Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional stereochemistry analysis is crucial for understanding the molecular behavior, but relies on measurements that encompass multiple molecules and obscure individual molecular dynamics. Single&#8208;molecule techniques enable real&#8208;time tracking of stereochemical transformations. These techniques include electrical methods (such as scanning probe microscopy, single&#8208;molecule junction techniques, and nanopore technology) and non&#8208;electrical approaches (such as circular dichroism spectroscopy and surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy). This review highlights recent advances in monitoring and regulation of stereochemical properties at the single&#8208;molecule level. Techniques that bridge macroscopic observations with molecular&#8208;scale dynamics are emphasized. Key isomerization phenomena (constitutional, configurational, and conformational isomerizations) are explored to demonstrate how light, electric field, and mechanical force regulate molecular states. The use of chiral molecules in optical tweezers, chiral&#8208;modified scanning tunneling microscopies, and graphene&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule junctions to leverage the chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity effect for enantiomer discrimination and manipulation is highlighted. Despite progress in this field, challenges persist in resolving ultrafast isomerization pathways, understanding chiral origin mechanisms, and integrating single&#8208;molecule devices. Emerging strategies combining multimodal stimuli, machine learning, and nanofabrication are promising for advancing stereochemical research and applications in molecular electronics and nanotechnology. This work underscores the transformative potential of single&#8208;molecule techniques in unveiling fundamental chemical dynamics and designing functional molecular systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Water Permeation by Aramid Foldamer Nanochannels with Hydrophobic Interiors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aquaporins are natural proteins that rapidly transport water across cell membranes, maintaining homeostasis, whilst strictly excluding salt. This has inspired their use in water purification and desalination, a critical emerging need. However, stability, scalability, and cost have prevented their widespread adoption in water purification membrane technologies. As such, attention has turned to the use of artificial water channels, with pore functionalized polymers and macrocycles providing a powerful alternative. Whilst impressive rates of transport have been achieved, the combination of a scalable, high&#8208;yielding synthesis and efficient transport has not yet been reported. Herein, we report such a system, with densely functionalized channel interiors, synthesized by high&#8208;yielding living polymerization with low polydispersities, showing high salt exclusion, and excellent water transport rates. Our aramid foldamers create artificial water channels with hydrophobic interiors, and single&#8208;channel water permeability rates of up to 108 water molecules per second per channel, approaching the range of natural Aquaporins (c. 109). We show that water transport rates closely correspond to the helical length, with the polymer which most closely matches bilayer thickness showing optimal efficacy, as supported by molecular dynamics simulations. Our work provides a basis for the scalable synthesis of next&#8208;generation artificial water channels.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Bond Boosts Circularly Polarized Radioluminescence in Chiral Mn(II) Hybrids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral scintillators combining scintillation and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) present a novel avenue for controlling light propagation and reducing optical crosstalk in conventional scintillators. However, quantitative evaluation of circularly polarized radioluminescence (CPRL) and strategies for enhancing performance under X&#8208;ray excitation remain underexplored. Herein, we conducted the designed synthesis of Mn(II) hybrid enantiomers, (1R/S,2R/S)&#8208;(N,N,N',N'&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine)2MnBr4&#183;2Br&#8722; (R/S&#8208;1), which exhibit intense CPL with photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields of 94.4% (R&#8208;1) and 94.1% (S&#8208;1), and PL dissymmetry factors (gPL) of &#8208;3.87&#215;10&#8208;3 (R&#8208;1) and +3.98&#215;10&#8208;3 (S&#8208;1). They demonstrate strong scintillation performance with record&#8208;breaking light yields of 70,061 and 68,514 photons/MeV in chiral scintillators. We pioneered quantitative evaluation of the CPRL of R/S&#8208;1, achieving radioluminescence dissymmetry factors (gRL) of &#8208;2.04&#215;10&#8722;3 and +2.55&#215;10&#8722;3. By incorporating hydrogen bonds into the structures through rational ligand design to facilitate chiral transfer, Mn(II) hybrid enantiomers (1R/S,2R/S)&#8208;(N,N'&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine)MnBr4 (R/S&#8208;2) achieve the gPL&#160;values of &#8208;2.56&#215;10&#8722;2 and +2.50&#215;10&#8722;2 with nearly 7 times increase relative to R/S&#8208;1. More inspiringly, the gRL&#160;values of R&#8208;2 are increased to &#8208;2.96&#215;10&#8722;2 with 15 times increase relative to R&#8208;1, representing the highest CPRL in lead&#8208;free chiral scintillators. This work not only manifests a new design strategy for advancing chiral scintillators, but also establishes a standard approach for evaluating CPRL properties.</dc:description>

They demonstrate strong scintillation performance with record-breaking light yields of 70,061 and 68,514 photons/MeV in chiral scintillators.

         <title>Dynamic Modulation of Keto&#8208;Enol Tautomerism in Electrolytes for Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reversibility of zinc (Zn) anode is subject to adverse reactions. Herein we design a dynamic modulation strategy via enol&#8208;keto tautomerism to inhibit the side reactions, thus improving the reversibility of the Zn anode. Density functional theory calculations and experimental results demonstrate the keto form of additives can be adsorbed on the Zn anode, inhibiting dendrites&#8217; growth, while the enol form can serve as a bidentate ligand to participate in the construction of solvation sheath for Zn2+, enhancing the kinetics of Zn2+ transport, simultaneously suppressing water activity and reducing HER and corrosion. After desolvation, the enol form of additives can react with by&#8208;products, further weakening passivation and morphological variation. Consequently, the Zn anode with optimal additive achieves high reversibility, where Zn||Zn symmetric cells operate over 4000 h at 10 mA cm&#8208;2/10 mAh cm&#8208;2, Zn||Cu asymmetric cells have a life for 930 h at 10 mA cm&#8208;2/10 mAh cm&#8208;2. Further, this dynamic modulation enables Zn||V2O5 full cells to work over 5000 cycles with a capacity retention of 83% at 5 A g&#8208;1, and the Zn||Br2 pouch cells deliver a high capacity of ~ 180 mAh. This study offers an original perspective on the dynamic regulation of the Zn anode.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A supramolecular receptor for short&#8208;chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylates was developed. The receptor displays a cage&#8208;like geometry, with a defined binding site for the carboxylate head groups and an opening for the perfluoroalkyl side chains.

         <title>Photoexcited Structural Diversification of Carboxylic Acids with Phosphorus Promoter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article showcases recent breakthroughs by Scheidt and co&#8208;workers in the photoexcited structural reconstruction of carboxylic acids. By leveraging hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer and cyclization sequences, the generated diradicals facilitate the synthesis of valuable &#945;&#8208;hydroxyl and amino phosphonates in a highly efficient and sustainable manner.








Abstract
Photoexcitation of carboxylic acids is challenging due to high energy requirements and low quantum efficiency. Recently, Scheidt and co&#8208;workers reported a single&#8208;flask transformation of carboxylic acids into acyl phosphonates, which facilitates the generation of diradicals under visible light irradiation. Building on this work, an efficient strategy for the structural reconstruction of carboxylic acids has been developed.

         <title>Unraveling the Cause of Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction Formation: Disparities in Metal Nanoparticle Anchoring Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) can be normally induced by the surface free energy differences between metal nanoparticles and supports. To gain deeper insights into the effect of SMSI on heterogeneous catalysis, we use prototype Pt, Pd/TiO2(anatase) systems to demonstrate different reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction activity changes, especially with increasing the metal nanoparticle (NP) loading. Our experiments show that the conventional surface&#8208;free&#8208;energy change law regarding the incremental NP size is no longer applicable to these systems, due to the overlook of the change of support properties owing to the disparities of the metal anchoring mechanisms. Both experimental measurements and DFT calculations show that Pt atoms strongly favor anchoring on the oxygen vacancies (Ov) over the OH&#8208;sites on the anatase TiO2 support. In contrast, Pd atoms lack such Ov&#8208;site preference compared to Pt atoms, thereby leaving higher content of Ov on the support than the Pt counterpart. Moreover, high density of residual Ov on the support can cause the Pd NPs to be in higher degree of contact with the support, either in NP&#8208;encapsulation state (experiment) or NP&#8208;spreading state (simulation). The enhanced CO2 conversion of Pt/TiO2A is attributed to the synergistic effect of Ov and hydrogen spillover from Pt sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Monocarboxylic Acid Structural Analogues Facilitate In Situ Composite of Functional Complexes for Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study was carried out to prepare highly uniform nickel&#8208;based complex nanospheres (NiSH) under the subtle force of hydrogen bonding. Nanocomposites with micro&#8208; and mesopores were synthesized in situ on the basis of ligand competition with salicylic acid structural analogs. The incorporation of hydrophobic functional groups effectively protected the electrode materials from degradation and corrosion. This research is expected to deepen the understanding of materials synthesis and pave the way for more sustainable energy solutions.








Abstract
In situ composite methods have aroused research interest in materials science and acted as a novel strategy to achieve structural tailoring of materials. However, the controllable preparation of composites containing functional groups remains a challenge. Herein, we report an approach based on competitive coordination between structural analogs, by which the functionally composite metal complex (NiSH@Ni&#8208;FSA) was synthesized. The introduction of different functional groups allows precise control of the functionality of composites, ranging from NiSH@Ni&#8208;ClSA&#8208;D, NiSH@Ni&#8208;BrSA to NiSH@Ni&#8208;CF3SA. More interestingly, the synthesized material retained the microporous and mesoporous structure of the original complexes. The incorporation of hydrophobic functional groups effectively protects the electrode materials from degradation and corrosion. Meanwhile, the presence of intermolecular hydrogen bonding facilitates new composite nanomaterials with better performance for advanced energy storage applications.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Construction of Nonadjacent Stereoelements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview highlights recent advances in the construction of nonadjacent stereogenic elements and summarizes the various strategies employed, including bifunctional catalysis, synergistic catalysis, cascade catalysis, and other approaches. The synthetic applications and mechanistic investigations are also discussed to facilitate understanding of this field.








Abstract
Nonadjacent chiral scaffolds are privileged motifs in bioactive molecules and medicines, which have stimulated chemists&#8217; ingenuity in achieving the asymmetric construction of non&#8208;contiguous chiral elements directly. Current strategies include bifunctional catalysis, synergistic catalysis, cascade catalysis and others, enabling the production of a wide range of enantiomerically enriched compounds featuring different combinations of nonadjacent chirality, including multiple elements of central chirality, central and allenyl axial chirality, and central and biaryl axial chirality. As compared to the patterns of multiple nonadjacent elements of central chirality, the latter two are less frequently reported. This minireview aims to summarize the key developments in reaction design, mechanistic studies, and synthetic applications, with the goal of stimulating further exploration in this important area of asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of Fortimicin B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric total synthesis of fortimicin B was realized in 12 steps (LLS) from readily available starting materials. The fortamine fragment was synthesized in a concise manner based on a newly developed enantioselective inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. The 6&#8208;epi&#8208;purpurosamine B fragment was constructed via a Cr(II)/Co(I)&#8208;mediated C&#9472;C bond coupling. These two fragments were connected through Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;glycosylation. This study provides a synthetic platform for future investigations into the structure&#8211;activity relationships of fortimicins.








Abstract
Fortimicins, featuring a pseudodisaccharide scaffold, are an unusual class of aminoglycosides (AGs) with potent efficacy against several aminoglycoside&#8208;resistant bacterial strains. Notably, these molecules also exhibit lower inherent ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity than common aminoglycosides. Consequently, fortimicins are a promising type of protoypical molecules for the development of the next generation of aminoglycoside antibiotics. Here, we report the asymmetric total synthesis of fortimicin B in 12 steps (longest linear sequence, LLS) from readily available starting materials. An enantioselective Cu(II)&#8208;catalyzed inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction of 2&#8208;pyrones and N&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;oxazolones was developed for the efficient synthesis of the fortamine fragment, which previously required a lengthy multistep synthesis owing to its complex stereochemistry. The 6&#8208;epi&#8208;purpurosamine B fragment was efficiently synthesized through a Cr(II)/Co(I)&#8208;mediated C&#9472;C bond coupling between aldehydes and alkyl halides. Within these two fragments, the stereoselective construction of the &#945;&#8208;glycosidic bond of fortimicin B was realized via the gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation. Overall, this study provides an efficient synthetic platform for future investigations into the structure&#8211;activity relationships of fortimicins.

         <title>Construction of Local&#8208;ion Trap in Phase&#8208;reversed Mixed Matrix COF Membranes for Ultrahigh Ion Selectivity.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial molecular/ion traps afford grand potential in membrane&#8208;based separation processes. However, the existing trap&#8208;based architectures often confer over&#8208;strong binding forces, which severely impedes the release of bound solutes during their transmembrane diffusion processes. Herein, we propose an unprecedented local&#8208;ion trap bearing moderate binding force and additional repulsion force in a type of phase&#8208;reversed mixed matrix covalent organic framework (PRCOF) membranes. By implementing COF as continuous phase and polymer as dispersed phase at molecular level, the local&#8208;ion trap is formed in the COF channels equipped with free amino groups from polyethyleneimine (PEI). This unique local&#8208;ion trap built by electronegative COF nano&#8208;domains and electropositive PEI nano&#8208;domains, offers appropriate interaction towards Li+, which allows the precise recognition and rapid transport of Li+ in the membrane channels. By tuning the microenvironments of local&#8208;ion trap, the optimum PRCOF&#8208;1 membrane exhibits considerably high actual selectivity of 190 along with rapid Li+ permeation rate of 0.262 mol h&#8208;1 m&#8208;2 in dealing with a Li+/Mg2+ binary mixture. This work provides in&#8208;depth insights into the design of high&#8208;performance membranes with appropriate chemical interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure of a DNA&#8208;Stabilised Ag16Cl2 Nanocluster in Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We determine the first solution&#8208;state structure of a DNA&#8208;stabilised Ag16Cl2&#160;nanocluster using X&#8209;ray total scattering and pair distribution function analysis. We find that the structure in solution exhibits both displacive and rotational distortions compared to the known crystal structure. Additionally, our measurements are sensitive towards changes in DNA conformation, revealing that the DNA scaffold in solution exhibits significantly more flexibility than when conformationally locked in the crystalline form. Our results demonstrate the capability to determine the structure of DNA&#8208;stabilised clusters beyond their crystallised form, an essential step towards understanding differences between their solution&#8208;phase and solid&#8208;state photophysical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Base Pairing of Nucleotide Triphosphates in Water by a Tetraphenylethene&#8208;Based Octaimidazolium Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Studying biomimetic hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) base pairing of nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) in aqueous solutions using artificial recognition systems can enhance our understanding of the principles of base pairing in natural systems. Here, we report a water&#8208;soluble tetraphenylethene&#8208;based octaimidazolium cage (1) as an artificial host, which promotes the biomimetic H&#8208;bonded base pairing of NTPs in water by forming their 1:1:1 hetero&#8208;ternary or 1:2 homo&#8208;ternary host&#8208;guest complexes. Both the matched and mismatched H&#8208;bonded base pairs of NTPs are stably captured within the cavity of 1 through the multiple noncovalent interactions of hydrogen bonds, CH&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;/&#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions, electrostatic forces, and hydrophobic effect. ITC studies reveal the aqueous biomimetic recognition of 1 for these base pairs is dominantly driven by either classical (entropy&#8208;driven, &#916;S &#8805; 0) or non&#8208;classical (enthalpy&#8208;driven, &#916;H &lt;&lt; 0) hydrophobic effects. The X&#8208;ray structure of the 1&#8226;GTP2 complex shows an unprecedented base pair (G:G*) with Watson&#8208;Crick H&#8208;bonded pattern, resulting from the prototropic tautomerism of normal guanine (G) to tautomeric guanine (G*). Through adaptive host&#8208;guest chirality transfer, 1 can also act as a chiroptical sensor, exhibiting differentiated circular dichroism (CD) for these base pairs and enabling dynamic CD inversion to monitor the pH&#8208;dependent transformation of GTP base pairs.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Overall Water Vapor Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic overall water vapor splitting (OWVS) into H2 and O2 not only owns the potential of avoiding the backward reaction of O2 reduction reaction reforming H2O, but also realize H2 production without available liquid water. However, this attempt is still a blank due to the weak absorption of photocatalysts to water vapor. Herein, we report the first example of visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven OWVS by combining the water&#8208;adsorbing ability and photocatalytic activity of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The overall water splitting activity of Tp&#8208;COF skeleton was realized by introducing tripyridyltriazine segment. The Pt@Tp&#8208;TAPyT&#8208;COF achieves high visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2 and O2 evolution rates of 148.4 and 74.8 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, respectively. Under water vapor conditions, the Pt@Tp&#8208;TAPyT&#8208;COF could drive OWVS even without backward reaction. By further optimizing the structure of &#946;&#8208;ketoamine section, it was found that the Pt@DHTA&#8208;TAPyT&#8208;COF showed optimal OWVS activity, with the H2 and O2 evolution rate of 51.2 and 25.6 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1&#160;respectively. The advantage of OWVS compared to traditional solid&#8208;liquid OWS was further confirmed by a continuous activity test of 45 h. Further experiments indicated that carbonyl&#8208;O and pyridine&#8208;N atoms in COFs server as water absorbing sites, and the absorbed water molecules could promote water splitting&#160;in COFs simultaneously.</dc:description>

         <title>Mannich&#8208;Type Polymers: A Versatile Platform for Water&#8208;Degradable, Malleable, and Environmentally Responsive Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer waste poses a significant environmental challenge with current recycling strategies often hindered by inefficient waste collection systems, high production costs, and limited material recyclability. While extensive efforts have been directed towards upcycling or degrading commercial polymers, as well as developing sustainable alternatives, many approaches remain constrained by their reliance on harsh conditions, specialized catalysts, or complex processing methods. In this study, we present a novel strategy to address the challenges by developing mechanically robust polymer networks that are readily degradable in water within 30 days. Our approach leverages a guanidine&#8208;based Mannich&#8208;type reaction utilizing three low&#8208;cost starting materials&#8212;guanidine hydrochloride, aldehyde, and diamine&#8212;under mild condition. Unlike traditional thermosets, which are often difficult to recycle, our polymer networks exhibit exceptional processability, enabling the fabrication of various forms, and demonstrate responsiveness to moisture. These properties, coupled with degradability, make them viable candidates for diverse applications. By introducing a scalable and sustainable pathway for designing next&#8208;generation recyclable polymers, our work advances the field of dynamic covalent chemistry and presents a novel class of sustainable polymer networks with significant potential for reducing environmental impact.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactive Hydrogen Species Behaviors on Pd/TiN: In situ SERS Guided Regulation for Chemoselective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Uncovering the H2 dissociation and H&#8208;spillover behaviors of the generated reactive hydrogen species on catalyst surfaces is crucial for achieving efficient and chemoselective hydrogenation. However, those behaviors remain largely elusive given the challenges of directly observing H atoms, the smallest atoms in the element table. Herein, we explored the Pd site&#8211;specific D2 cleavage and the H&#8208;spillover behaviors of dissociated D on the titanium nitride (TiN) support via in situ surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopically (SERS). Besides facilitated forming Pd single atom (Pd1), fully exposed Pd cluster (Pdn) and Pd nanoparticles, dissociated D2 on Pd sites (indicated by &#957;Pd&#8211;D at 1,800 cm&#8208;1), spillover to TiN, and formation of the N&#8211;D bond (indicated by &#957;N&#8211;D at 2,400 cm&#8208;1) were spectroscopically traceable. Combined with density functional &#160;theory (DFT) calculation, Pdn is identified as the most favorable site for the provision of reactive H through hydrogen spillover. Moreover, we propose &#957;Pd&#8208;D and the &#957;N&#8208;D/&#957;Pd&#8208;D ratio as the index to relative amounts of Pd1 and Pdn sites, respectively, and develop an in situ SERS&#8208;based method to study the synthesis&#8211;structure&#8211;activity relationship of Pd/TiN catalyst with an optimized structure for chemoselective hydrogenation.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking the Potential of Machine Learning in Co&#8208;crystal Prediction by a Novel Approach Integrating Molecular Thermodynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel framework integrating thermodynamic mechanisms and machine learning was developed to predict coformers and reaction solvents for co&#8208;crystallization. The model showcased superior performance in coformer and solvent predicting with accuracy over 90% in independent test sets. SHAP analysis revealed key thermodynamic drivers, enhancing mechanistic insights. Experimental validation on ketoconazole further confirmed the model's effectiveness.








Abstract
Co&#8208;crystal engineering is of interest for many applications in pharmaceutical, chemical, and materials fields, but rational design of co&#8208;crystals is still challenging. Although artificial intelligence has revolutionized decision&#8208;making processes in material design, limitations in generalization and mechanistic understanding remain. Herein, we sought to improve prediction of co&#8208;crystals by combining mechanistic thermodynamic modeling with machine learning. We constructed a brand&#8208;new co&#8208;crystal database, integrating drug, coformer, and reaction solvent information. By incorporating various thermodynamic models, the predictive performance was significantly enhanced. Benefiting from the complementarity of thermodynamic mechanisms and structural descriptors, the model coupling three thermodynamic models achieved optimal predictive performance in coformer and solvent screening. The model was rigorously validated against benchmark models using challenging independent test sets, showcasing superior performance in both coformer and solvent predicting with accuracy over 90%. Further, we employed SHAP analysis for model interpretation, suggesting that thermodynamic mechanisms are prominent in the model's decision&#8208;making. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies on ketoconazole validated the model's efficacy in identifying coformers/solvents, demonstrating its potential in practical application.

     alt="Unlocking the Potential of Machine Learning in Co-crystal Prediction by a Novel Approach Integrating Molecular Thermodynamics"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel framework integrating thermodynamic mechanisms and machine learning was developed to predict coformers and reaction solvents for co-crystallization. The model showcased superior performance in coformer and solvent predicting with accuracy over 90% in independent test sets. SHAP analysis revealed key thermodynamic drivers, enhancing mechanistic insights. Experimental validation on ketoconazole further confirmed the model's effectiveness.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-crystal engineering is of interest for many applications in pharmaceutical, chemical, and materials fields, but rational design of co-crystals is still challenging. Although artificial intelligence has revolutionized decision-making processes in material design, limitations in generalization and mechanistic understanding remain. Herein, we sought to improve prediction of co-crystals by combining mechanistic thermodynamic modeling with machine learning. We constructed a brand-new co-crystal database, integrating drug, coformer, and reaction solvent information. By incorporating various thermodynamic models, the predictive performance was significantly enhanced. Benefiting from the complementarity of thermodynamic mechanisms and structural descriptors, the model coupling three thermodynamic models achieved optimal predictive performance in coformer and solvent screening. The model was rigorously validated against benchmark models using challenging independent test sets, showcasing superior performance in both coformer and solvent predicting with accuracy over 90%. Further, we employed SHAP analysis for model interpretation, suggesting that thermodynamic mechanisms are prominent in the model's decision-making. Proof-of-concept studies on ketoconazole validated the model's efficacy in identifying coformers/solvents, demonstrating its potential in practical application. Overall, our work enhanced the understanding of co-crystallization and highlighted the strategy that integrates mechanistic insights with data-driven models to accelerate the rational design and synthesis of co-crystals, as well as various other functional materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Short Peptides Activates Specific ER&#8208;Phagy and Induces Pyroptosis for Enhanced Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present stable ER&#8208;targeting short peptides that mimic misfolded proteins through self&#8208;assembly, selectively inducing ER&#8208;phagy without initiating autophagy of other organelles. Persistent ER&#8208;phagy triggered by these peptides leads to pyroptosis and antitumor immune responses via Ca2+ and mtROS dysregulation. We provide a powerful tool for elucidating ER&#8208;phagy mechanisms and a promising strategy for anticancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Developing specific endoplasmic reticulum&#8208;autophagy (ER&#8208;phagy) inducers is highly desirable for discovering new ER&#8208;phagy receptors and elucidating the detailed ER&#8208;phagy mechanism and potential cancer immunotherapy. However, most of the current ER&#8208;phagy&#8208;inducing methods cause nonselective autophagy of other organelles. In this work, we report the design and synthesis of simple and stable short peptides (D&#8208;FFxFFs) that could specifically trigger ER&#8208;phagy, which further induces pyroptosis and activates the immune response against tumor cells. D&#8208;FFxFFs locate preferentially in ER and readily self&#8208;assemble to form nanosized misfolded protein mimics, which lead to distinct upregulation of dedicated ER&#8208;phagy receptors with no obvious autophagy of other organelles. Significant unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated via IRE1&#8208;JNK and PERK&#8208;ATF4 pathways. Interestingly, the persistent ER&#8208;phagy triggers ER Ca2+ release and a surge in mitochondrial Ca2+ levels, resulting in GSDMD&#8208;mediated pyroptosis other than apoptosis. The ER&#8208;phagy induces pyroptosis and activates a distinct antitumor immune response without evolving the acquired drug resistance. This work not only provides a powerful tool for investigating the mechanism and function of ER&#8208;phagy but also offers an appealing strategy for anticancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Spatially Controlled Co&#8208;Delivery of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Agents Using DNA Nanoframeworks for Pancreatic Cancer Precision Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Theranostic platforms that integrate diagnostic and therapeutic functionalities offer promising strategies for precision medicine, particularly in the treatment of major diseases. However, the development of platforms capable of achieving spatially controlled detection and therapy at the lesion site remains a significant challenge. Herein, we present a dual&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive DNA nanoframework that achieve spatially controlled co&#8208;delivery of molecular beacon (MB) and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP), enabling simultaneous specific optical detection and efficient gene therapy for pancreatic cancer. The DNA nanoframeworks are synthesized via precipitation polymerization, utilizing acrylamide&#8208;modified DNA to initiate a hybridization chain reaction that facilitates the effective loading of MB&#8208;extended and sgRNA&#8208;conjugated DNA hairpins. The Cas9 protein is efficiently loaded into the nanoframeworks through phase transition&#8208;induced polymer chain rearrangement, overcoming steric hindrance. Upon aptamer&#8208;mediated internalization into PANC&#8208;1 cells, the overexpressed apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 and ribonuclease H in cancer cells induce site&#8208;specific cleave of MB and DNA&#8208;RNA hybrid duplex, respectively. This cleavage restores fluorescence for specific optical detection, while the released Cas9 RNP performs gene editing for efficient therapy. Low fluorescence background and favorable biocompatibility are observed in normal cells. In a pancreatic cancer mouse model, the platform demonstrates significant detection&#8208;guided antitumor efficacy, highlighting its potential for precision medicine in cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Breaking the Activity&#8208;Stability Trade&#8208;Off of RuO2 via Metallic Ru Bilateral Regulation for Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing highly efficient acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is crucial for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer. RuO2 electrocatalysts, which followed a kinetically favorable lattice oxygen mechanism, perform a preferable intrinsic activity, but poor stability for acidic OER. Recent work often sacrifices the intrinsic activity of RuO2 to enhance stability. The balance between the activity and stability of RuO2&#8208;based catalysts is still overlooked in current research. Here, we report a controlled method to introduce metallic Ru onto RuO2 catalysts to form the Ru4+&#8211;O&#8211;Ru0 interfacial structure for decreasing the Ru4+ oxidation state and promoting deprotonation kinetics. Metallic Ru can serve as the electron donor to lower the oxidation state of *Vo&#8208;RuO42&#8722; in Ru/RuO2 for stabilizing the structure of *Vo&#8208;RuO42&#8722;&#8208;Ru/RuO2 to favour the acidic OER stability. Moreover, the deprotonation kinetics via the interfacial oxygen site between Ru4+ and Ru0 is significantly enhanced on Ru/RuO2 catalysts to improve the acidic OER activity. This work offers a unique perspective to balance the acidic OER activity and stability of RuO2.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Lugdunomycin via Sequential Photoinduced Spiroketalization and Isobenzofuran Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochemical synthetic strategy inspired by the angucyclinone biosynthesis culminated in the total synthesis of lugdunomycin. The keys in the total synthesis were 1) the design of the photoinduced spiroketalization to constitute elmonin from actinaphthoran B, and 2) photoinduced isobenzofuran Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between elmonin and iso&#8208;maleimycin to construct the polycyclic framework.








Abstract
The presence of sterically rigid contiguous quaternary stereocenters in natural products imposes conformational constraints with significant effects on their biological activities. However, achieving the direct synthesis of multiple contiguous quaternary stereocenters in a single step remains a formidable challenge. Here, we present the total synthesis of the antibacterial metabolite lugdunomycin (1) in thirteen steps via a sequence of photochemical transformations. A photoenolization, keto&#8211;enol tautomerization, and spiroketalization sequence was developed to generate the spiroketal 4 from actinaphthoran B (3). Subsequently, a photoinduced isobenzofuran Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between elmonin (4) and iso&#8208;maleimycin (5) was developed to construct the polycyclic benzaza[4,3,3]propellane framework bearing three contiguous quaternary stereocenters in the compact C&#8208;ring along with a distal hydroxyl group at C19. The mechanism of these photochemical reactions was investigated using synthetic and computational approaches.

         <title>Iridium(III) Carbene Complexes Featuring Either Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Ligand Charge Transfer (MLCT) or Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer (TSCT) Blue Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ir(III) complexes with contrasting MLCT or TSCT transition characters were synthesized, among which the TSCT emitter f&#8208;ct13b gave PhOLED device with an EQEmax of 22.2% and CIExy of (0.155, 0.120). Additionally, hyper&#8208;OLED bearing another TSCT sensitizer, f&#8208;ct13c and v&#8208;DABNA terminal emitter, achieved a narrowband blue hyperphosphorescence with EQEmax of 28.2% and CIExy of (0.123, 0.129), highlighting the effectiveness of TSCT phosphor in realizing blue electroluminescence.








Abstract
Through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT), rather than the commonly postulated metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) process, was proposed in getting the lowest lying excited state of newly designed Ir(III) blue phosphors. Accordingly, two benzo[d]imidazolylidene pro&#8208;chelates, L12H2+ and L13H2+, one with two cyano groups at the peri&#8208;benzo and N&#8208;aryl pendent and the other with its peri&#8208;cyano group being replaced with methyl substituent, were employed in syntheses of Ir(III) complexes f&#8208;ct12b,c and f&#8208;ct13b,c. Notably, complexes f&#8208;ct12b,c exhibited the traditional MLCT process, while f&#8208;ct13b,c were dominated by the TSCT transition, resulting in a smaller S1&#8211;T1 energy gap &#916;EST. Next, it prompted us to explore whether their long&#8208;lived emission originated from phosphorescence or thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Although temperature&#8208;dependent emission studies favor TADF, the unresolved concerns are still discussed in depth. For application, OLED with the TSCT&#8208;based dopant f&#8208;ct13b delivered a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.2% and a max. luminance of 10&#160;000&#160;cd m&#8210;2, together with CIExy of (0.155, 0.120). Moreover, the hyper&#8208;OLED with f&#8208;ct13c sensitizer and v&#8208;DABNA terminal emitter exhibited a max.

     alt="Iridium(III) Carbene Complexes Featuring Either Metal-to-Ligand Charge Transfer (MLCT) or Through-Space Charge Transfer (TSCT) Blue Luminescence"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ir(III) complexes with contrasting MLCT or TSCT transition characters were synthesized, among which the TSCT emitter &lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;-ct13b&lt;/b&gt; gave PhOLED device with an EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 22.2% and CIE&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; of (0.155, 0.120). Additionally, hyper-OLED bearing another TSCT sensitizer, &lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;-ct13c&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;-DABNA terminal emitter, achieved a narrowband blue hyperphosphorescence with EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 28.2% and CIE&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; of (0.123, 0.129), highlighting the effectiveness of TSCT phosphor in realizing blue electroluminescence.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through-space charge transfer (TSCT), rather than the commonly postulated metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) process, was proposed in getting the lowest lying excited state of newly designed Ir(III) blue phosphors. Accordingly, two benzo[&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;]imidazolylidene pro-chelates, &lt;b&gt;L12H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;L13H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, one with two cyano groups at the &lt;i&gt;peri&lt;/i&gt;-benzo and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-aryl pendent and the other with its &lt;i&gt;peri&lt;/i&gt;-cyano group being replaced with methyl substituent, were employed in syntheses of Ir(III) complexes &lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;-ct12b&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;b&gt;c&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;-ct13b&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;b&gt;c&lt;/b&gt;. Notably, complexes &lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;-ct12b&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;b&gt;c&lt;/b&gt; exhibited the traditional MLCT process, while &lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;-ct13b,c&lt;/b&gt; were dominated by the TSCT transition, resulting in a smaller S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; energy gap &#916;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt;. Next, it prompted us to explore whether their long-lived emission originated from phosphorescence or thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Although temperature-dependent emission studies favor TADF, the unresolved concerns are still discussed in depth. For application, OLED with the TSCT-based dopant &lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;-ct13b&lt;/b&gt; delivered a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.2% and a max. luminance of 10&#160;000&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8210;2&lt;/sup&gt;, together with CIE&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; of (0.155, 0.120). Moreover, the hyper-OLED with &lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;-ct13c&lt;/b&gt; sensitizer and &lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;-DABNA terminal emitter exhibited a max. EQE of 28.2% and CIE&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; of (0.123, 0.129), demonstrating a new approach in developing efficient Ir(III) blue phosphors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Two&#8208;Color Single&#8208;Molecule Blinking Ratiometricity: A Functional Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging Approach for Resolving Lysosomal pH and Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduced two&#8208;color single&#8208;molecule blinking ratiometricity (2C&#8208;SMBR) for simultaneous nanoscale imaging and pH measurement in lysosomes. Using two pH&#8208;dependent blinking fluorophores, 2C&#8208;SMBR resolved lysosomal pH heterogeneity (4.0&#8211;6.0) and enabled real&#8208;time correlation of lysosomal dynamics with pH changes, offering new insights into lysosomal function.








Abstract
Fluorescence super&#8208;resolution microscopy has enabled nanoscale imaging of intracellular structures, but it remains challenging to simultaneously achieve structural imaging and quantitative functional characterization, such as pH measurement, within the same region. Here, we introduce two&#8208;color single&#8208;molecule blinking ratiometricity (2C&#8208;SMBR), a novel method that integrates structural and functional imaging with single&#8208;molecule precision. By loading lysosomes with two pH&#8208;dependent spontaneously blinking fluorophores of distinct colors, 2C&#8208;SMBR leverages single&#8208;molecule localization of either fluorophore to achieve nanoscale structural imaging of lysosomes, whereas the ratiometric analysis of blinking dynamics between the two fluorophores provides quantitative pH measurement at the single&#8208;lysosome level. This dual&#8208;color ratiometric approach at the single&#8208;molecule level enables precise quantification of lysosomal pH with exceptional spatiotemporal resolution. Using 2C&#8208;SMBR, we reveal that lysosomal pH is highly heterogeneous at the single&#8208;lysosome level, with distinct subpopulations exhibiting diverse pH values. Our measurements show a pH range of 4.0&#8211;6.0 within lysosomes, with perinuclear lysosomes averaging a pH of approximately 4.88, whereas peripheral lysosomes average around 5.64. Crucially, 2C&#8208;SMBR enables real&#8208;time correlation between lysosomal dynamics and pH changes, overcoming a key limitation of super&#8208;resolution imaging. This approach not only advances nanoscale organelle characterization but also provides mechanistic insights into lysosomal physiology and function.

         <title>Identifying Spatially Segregated Ir Sites Within ZSM&#8208;5 for Enhanced Redox Cycle in NOx Reduction by CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ir@ZSM&#8208;5 was prepared via a one&#8208;pot synthesis, where Ir clusters were confined within the zeolite pores, achieving valence state balance through spatial confinement. SO2 and O2 synergistically regulate the valence states of Ir species, thereby influencing the reaction pathway of NOx reduction by CO.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance Ir&#8208;based catalysts for selective catalytic reduction of NOx by CO (CO&#8208;SCR) under low temperatures remains challenging. This study presents an Ir&#8208;based catalyst encapsulated in Zeolite Socony Mobil&#8208;5 (Ir@ZSM&#8208;5), with Ir species partially confined in micropores (Ir&#948;+) and partially aggregated on the surface (Ir0), achieving &#8764;88% NOx conversion at 230&#160;&#176;C in the presence of 5% O2 and 100&#160;ppm SO2. The confined Ir&#948;+ species exhibit enhanced stability and oxidation states, whereas surface&#8208;aggregated Ir0 species, with weaker oxygen coordination, remain in a metallic state. The dynamic equilibrium between Ir&#948;+ and Ir0 significantly improves the balance of CO oxidation and NO reduction. O2 promotes the oxidation of Ir0 to Ir&#948;+, whereas SO2 facilitates the reverse, forming a reversible cycle that sustains catalytic efficiency. This work underscores the strategic interplay of Ir valence states and highlights a pathway for designing stable, high&#8208;performance Ir&#8208;based catalysts tailored for CO&#8208;SCR under complex reaction conditions.

         <title>Silylation of Aryl and Alkyl Chlorides by a Seven&#8208;Membered Dialkoxysilyl Group Si(pan)Me via an In Situ Generated Silylpotassium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals a facile silylation protocol that enables the delivery of a stable and activatable dioxasilepanyl group, Si(pan)Me, to aryl and alkyl chlorides. Of note is the X&#8208;ray structure of 18&#8208;C&#8208;6&#183;K&#8211;Si(pan)Me, which elucidates a pivotal silylpotassium intermediate. Our experimental mechanistic studies reveal a halogen&#8208;metal exchange (HME) pathway, with a partial SN2 mechanism for alkyl substrates, supported by computational rationale.








Abstract
Silicon&#8208;containing compounds are increasingly vital in pharmaceutical and agrochemical applications, yet existing silylation methods face critical limitations: poor reactivity of unactivated silanes and instability of activated silylation reagents and their products. Here, we present a seven&#8208;membered dialkoxysilyl unit, dioxasilepane, abbreviated as Si(pan), that combines exceptional stability with controllable reactivity. We demonstrate a versatile method for Si(pan)Me incorporation into organic molecules through reactions with diverse aryl, alkenyl, and alkyl chlorides. Notably, we have isolated and structurally characterized the key silylpotassium intermediate as its 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 complex through X&#8208;ray crystallography. Experimental mechanistic studies reveal that this silylpotassium species mediates the transformation primarily through halogen&#8208;metal exchange (HME). Computational investigations confirm the HME pathway while suggesting a concurrent SN2 mechanism for specific primary alkyl chlorides. This methodology establishes Si(pan) as a robust building block for constructing silicon&#8208;containing molecular frameworks, addressing a longstanding challenge in organic synthesis.

         <title>Charge Tuning and Anchor Effect Achieving Stable High&#8208;Voltage Layered Metal Oxides for Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing La into the NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) cathode material, the release of lattice oxygen is suppressed due to the charge tuning effect of La. Simultaneously, the as&#8208;formed LaO6 octahedra serve as stable anchors to stabilize the TM layers, ultimately improving the performance of NFM under various extreme conditions.








Abstract
Layered metal oxides (LMOs) that can stably operate at high voltage are vital to developing high&#8208;energy sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, the irreversible oxygen redox reaction of LMOs at the high voltage region (i.e., &gt;4.0&#160;V vs. Na+/Na) will cause serious oxygen evolution and structural instability, and therefore sharp capacity fading. Herein, we report the charge tuning and anchor effect of La doping to enhance the cycling stability of layered NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) under extreme conditions (e.g., high voltage and temperature). The La doping introduces additional negative charges to the oxygen ligands of transition metals (TM) and facilitates charge transfer, thereby reducing oxygen evolution at 4.1&#160;V and enhancing the kinetics of the redox process. Moreover, the as&#8208;formed LaO6 octahedra serve as stable anchors for the TM layers, preventing the formation of lattice nanocracks. As a result, the La&#8208;modified NFM exhibits a high capacity of 173.4 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1C (1C = 150&#160;mA g&#8722;1) and capacity retention of 71.21% at 2.0&#8211;4.2&#160;V after 500 cycles at 1C, which are higher than those of NFM. Additionally, the full cell achieves a high energy density of 438.78&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 (based on cathode mass), with a retention of 70.2% over 400 cycles, implying the great application potential of this concept.

&lt;p&gt;By introducing La into the NaNi&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NFM) cathode material, the release of lattice oxygen is suppressed due to the charge tuning effect of La. Simultaneously, the as-formed LaO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedra serve as stable anchors to stabilize the TM layers, ultimately improving the performance of NFM under various extreme conditions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Layered metal oxides (LMOs) that can stably operate at high voltage are vital to developing high-energy sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, the irreversible oxygen redox reaction of LMOs at the high voltage region (i.e., &amp;gt;4.0&#160;V vs. Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Na) will cause serious oxygen evolution and structural instability, and therefore sharp capacity fading. Herein, we report the charge tuning and anchor effect of La doping to enhance the cycling stability of layered NaNi&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NFM) under extreme conditions (e.g., high voltage and temperature). The La doping introduces additional negative charges to the oxygen ligands of transition metals (TM) and facilitates charge transfer, thereby reducing oxygen evolution at 4.1&#160;V and enhancing the kinetics of the redox process. Moreover, the as-formed LaO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedra serve as stable anchors for the TM layers, preventing the formation of lattice nanocracks. As a result, the La-modified NFM exhibits a high capacity of 173.4 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1C (1C = 150&#160;mA g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and capacity retention of 71.21% at 2.0&#8211;4.2&#160;V after 500 cycles at 1C, which are higher than those of NFM. Additionally, the full cell achieves a high energy density of 438.78&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (based on cathode mass), with a retention of 70.2% over 400 cycles, implying the great application potential of this concept.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Modular Approach Toward BN&#8208;Embedded Terrylene Diimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of BN&#8208;embedded terrylene diimides (BN&#8208;TDIs) were synthesized in a modular manner. Manipulation of dipole moments of the BN&#8208;TDIs was achieved via different BN unit(s) insertion. Strong carbonyl&#8208;&#960; interactions were observed in their crystals, which could be utilized in the construction of supramolecular architectures. BN&#8208;TDIs showcased typical electron transport behavior, making them one of the few examples of n&#8208;type BN&#8208;embedded molecules.








Abstract
This work presents the first example of heteroatoms embedded terrylene diimides (TDIs), which were synthesized from the BN&#8208;embedded imide building block in a modular manner. Through the control of the amount and orientations of the BN unit(s), the manipulation of dipole moments of the obtained BN&#8208;embedded terrylene diimides (BN&#8208;TDIs) was achieved, which in turn extended the fluorescence of BN&#8208;TDIs to near infrared region. The structures of BN&#8208;TDIs were established via single crystal X&#8208;ray diffractions. Stronger carbonyl&#8208;&#960; interactions were observed for BN&#8208;TDIs in their crystal structures compared with that of TDI, which could be utilized in the construction of supramolecular architectures. The organic thin film transistors based on BN&#8208;TDIs were also fabricated. BN&#8208;TDI&#8208;S showcased higher electron mobilities than that of TDI, indicating the potential of BN&#8208;TDIs as promising n&#8208;type organic semiconductors.

         <title>Plastics of the Future? Interdisciplinary Review on Biobased and Biodegradable Polymers: Progress in Chemistry, Societal Views, and Environmental Implications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Global demand to reduce polymer waste and microplastics pollution has increased in recent years, prompting further research, development, and wider use of biodegradable and biobased polymers (BBPs). BBPs have emerged as promising alternatives to conventional plastics, with the potential to mitigate the environmental burdens of persistent plastic waste. We provide an updated perspective on their impact, five years after our last article, featuring several recent advances, particularly in exploring broader variety of feedstock, applying novel chemical modifications and developing new functionalities. Life&#8208;cycle&#8208;assessments reveal that environmental performance of BBPs depends on several factors including feedstock selection, production efficiency, and end&#8208;of&#8208;life management. Furthermore, the introduction of BBPs in several everyday life products has also influenced consumer perception, market dynamics, and regulatory frameworks. While offering environmental advantages in specific applications, BBPs also raise concerns regarding their biodegradability under varying environmental conditions, potential microplastic generation, and soil health impacts. We highlight the need for a circular approach considering the entire polymer life&#8208;cycle, from feedstock sourcing, modification and use, to end&#8208;of&#8208;life options. Interdisciplinary research, collaborative initiatives, and informed policymaking are crucial to unlocking the full potential of BBPs and exploiting their contribution to create a circular economy and more sustainable future.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three imino&#8208;pyrrole zinc complexes were prepared and applied to the rapid degradation of PLA and the depolymerisation of BPA&#8208;PC and PET. PLA alcoholysis proceeded rapidly at a range of conditions, including reflux in air. Remarkable activity was demonstrated for the solvent&#8208;free methanolysis of PLA at mild conditions with full conversion reached in 11 minutes at 80 &#176;C. Various conditions were investigated including a range of PLA sources and, importantly, catalyst recycling was demonstrated. The methanolysis of BPA&#8208;PC and the glycolysis of PET were achieved, the latter giving full conversion after 1.5 hours for all catalysts. The chemical recycling of mixed plastic feedstocks was investigated, including the selective and sequential degradation of a PLA/BPA&#8208;PC mixture with a single catalyst and solvent.</dc:description>

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Basicity Diverts the Site&#8208;Selectivity of Aromatic Deuteration: Application to the Late&#8208;Stage Labelling of Pharmaceuticals.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isotope labelling, particularly with deuterium (2H), plays a critical role in drug discovery due to its ease of incorporation and its potential to switch unwanted metabolic transformations. Deuterium incorporation can enhance drug stability, affect pharmacokinetics, and alter metabolism pathways. Current deuterium labeling methods focus on hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE), and typically rely on the use of transition metal catalysis. Herein, we present a metal&#8208;free approach for aromatic HIE, utilizing photoexcitation in deuterated hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP&#8208;d1). By exploiting the enhanced basicity of excited&#8208;state aromatics, this method achieves selective deuteration at positions often inaccessible by traditional methods. The approach is efficient and was demonstrated across a broad number of complex drug molecules. Transient absorption spectroscopy confirms the formation of deuterated arenium ions.</dc:description>

         <title>Azobenzene&#8208;Oxindole Photochromic Dyads</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manipulation of molecular geometry using photoresponsive units is a powerful tool in supramolecular chemistry, smart materials, and photopharmacology. Current synthetic chemistry offers many responsive molecules that perform such a task. However, the incorporation of various photoresponsive units in a single molecule to achieve several geometrical changes remains scarce, particularly when they are in close proximity. The development of such systems is limited by challenges arising from selectively addressing the photoresponsive moieties and the analysis of complex mixtures. Here, we overcome these challenges by constructing a novel hetero&#8208;photochromic azobenzene&#8208;oxindole dyad (AOD). Both chromophores can be addressed and quantified in solution by in&#8208;situ NMR irradiation analysis. Additionally, this method allows us to unravel the intricate photokinetic relationships between the two chromophores leading to the observation of an unprecedented molecular motion; an azobenzene E&#160;&#224;&#160;Z&#160;&#224;&#160;E isomerization at a single wavelength due to the oxindole influence. By functionalizing the azobenzene ring we showed that the responsiveness of the system is maintained in seven distinct AODs. Overall, the photochromic dyad offers dramatic geometrical changes over its four isomers, making it a useful tool for further applications in which such behavior is desired such as host&#8208;guest systems, responsive materials, photopharmacology and molecular machines.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis of a wavy mesoporous 2D covalent organic framework (COF) with a 6&#8208;nm hexagonal pore lattice (Joa&#8208;COF&#8208;1) is reported. This has been achieved by the synthesis of a terpyrenyl linker of approximately 2.7 nm in length and its subsequent condensation with a 3&#8208;connected non&#8208;planar cata&#8208;hexabenzocoronene. Joa&#8208;COF&#8208;1 exists as non&#8208;covalent tubular domains composed of &#960;&#8208;stacked 4&#8208;5 pores 2D COF sections that can be separated by mild sonication, resulting in a family of tubular COF nanostructures that combine a 1D morphology with accessible mesopores.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Access to Conjugated Z,Z,Z&#8208;Trienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intercepting reactions has recently emerged as an innovative approach in organic synthesis, allowing chemists to harness reactive intermediates to access structures and functionalities that conventional methods cannot easily achieve. By deliberately manipulating reaction pathways, this strategy provides a unique avenue to explore unusual reactivities and complex molecular architectures. In this work, we have developed a new protocol for the nucleophile&#8208;intercepted Beckmann fragmentation reaction (NuBFr). Employing tropone oxime tosylate &#8208; a simple and readily accessible precursor &#8208; and a diverse set of nucleophiles generated in situ from alcohols, phenols, thiols, and alkynes with strong bases, we successfully synthesized a library of novel conjugated Z,Z,Z&#8208;trienecarbonitrile derivatives. This method facilitates rapid access to the conjugated Z,Z,Z&#8208;triene motif, a structural feature rarely encountered in synthetic chemistry. Our computational studies indicate that the NuBFr reaction likely proceeds through the formation of a bicylic azirine intermediate. The resulting Z,Z,Z&#8208;trienecarbonitriles could undergo an unprecedented thermally induced 8&#960;/6&#960;/4&#960; electrocyclization cascade sequence to produce trisubstituted olefins. This sequence underscores the fundamental value of these motifs in pushing the boundaries of unusual reactivities in organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Imaging Heterogeneous Patterns of Aminopeptidase N Activity in Hierarchical Tissue Structures Through High&#8208;resolution Whole&#8208;organ 3D Mapping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymes play a crucial role in regulating physiological functions, and abnormal enzyme activity is associated with various pathological conditions. Precise imaging of enzyme activity in tissues, providing detailed spatial and quantitative information, advances our understanding of physiological and pathological processes. Despite their importance, there is still a lack of methods for high&#8208;resolution 3D imaging of enzyme activity across entire tissues. In this research, we report a methodology for high&#8208;resolution, whole&#8208;organ 3D mapping of enzyme activity, which combines tissue clearing techniques with an activity&#8208;based covalent chemical probe. Focusing on aminopeptidase N (APN) as a representative target of peptidase, we developed ANA&#8208;o&#8208;BODIPY, an activity&#8208;based covalent fluorescent probe compatible with tissue clearing for imaging APN activity. Upon activation by APN, ANA&#8208;o&#8208;BODIPY produces a reactive intermediate, aza&#8208;quinone methide, which covalently binds to proximal proteins. This covalent probe is successfully utilized to record the location of APN activity during the tissue clearing process. By combining the probe with tissue clearing techniques, we have achieved high&#8208;resolution 3D mapping of APN activity across whole organs for the first time. Moreover, this advancement allowed us to visualize the heterogeneity of APN activity in individual tubular structures and to uncover the inhibitory effects of different APN inhibitors.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Stable Sn&#8208;Pb Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by Phenol&#8208;Functionalized Hole Transporting Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites, a most promising low bandgap semiconductor for multi&#8208;junction solar cells, are often limited in stability due to the susceptibility of Sn2+ to oxidation1,2. Inspired by the antioxidative properties of polyphenolic compounds3,4, we introduce the reductive phenol group and strong electronegative fluorine into an organic conjugated structure and design a multi&#8208;functional polymer with fluorine and phenol units (PF&#8208;OH). The design of PF&#8208;OH allows the effective rise in the energy barrier of Sn2+ oxidation, leading to a significant enhancement in the stability of Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite devices from 200 h to 8,000 h&#8212;an improvement of around 100 times. Additionally, the strong binding energy between Sn2+ and the phenol in PF&#8208;OH critically influences the crystallization and grain growth of Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite, resulting in perovskite films with fewer pinholes at the buried interface and extended carrier lifetimes. This enhancement not only boosts the power conversion efficiency to 23.61% but also significantly improves the operational stability of the devices. Ultimately, this design strategy has been proven universal through the phenolization of a series of molecules, marking a milestone in enhancing the stability of Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide from Water and Air Over Water&#8208;Dispersible Anthraquinone&#8208;Based Porous Aromatic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational design and synthesis of novel anthraquinone (AQ)&#8208;based porous aromatic frameworks (AQ&#8208;PAFs) photocatalyst composed of AQ and thiophene&#8208;derived fragments are presented. The interfacial hydrogen bonding enables mono&#8208;dispersion states of these AQ&#8208;PAFs in water&#8208;only systems, which ensures the optimal exposure of catalytically active sites to light and reactants. This catalyst system promotes the optimal H2O2 photosynthesis from water and air in the absence of any organic alcohols, in a high H2O2 production rate of 7124&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1. A continuous H2O2 production in AQ&#8208;PAFs&#8208;based flow system for 190&#160;h is also achieved.








Abstract
Photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide from earth&#8208;abundant water and air over organo&#8208;based semiconducting materials is a promising alternative to the traditional anthraquinone (AQ) method. However, the generally hydrophobic nature of organic semiconductors has led to their poor dispersibilities in aqueous systems, which built huge barriers for photon capture and reactant contact in water&#8208;based photocatalysis. Aiming at this issue, this study reports the facile synthesis of AQ&#8208;based porous aromatic frameworks (AQ&#8208;PAFs) by coupling AQ fragments with thiophene&#8208;derived linkers via robust carbon&#8211;carbon bonds. Remarkably, the interfacial hydrogen bonding interactions between water molecules and AQ sites on the surface improve the general hydrophilicity of AQ&#8208;PAFs, which can be well&#8208;dispersed in water&#8208;only systems with uniform particle size distributions. Moreover, the AQ moieties also function as mediators of photoinduced electrons, and the protons produced from water oxidation reaction (WOR), which would kinetically favor the charge separation and subsequent electron transfer reactions. The mono&#8208;dispersed AQ&#8208;PAF photocatalyst promotes hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) photosynthesis from water and air under visible light achieving a high productivity of 7124&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 in the absence of any organic alcohol reagents among organic semiconductor photocatalysts. Furthermore, a continuous H2O2 photosynthesis for 190&#160;h is also achieved in a flow system.

A continuous H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production in AQ-PAFs-based flow system for 190&#160;h is also achieved.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide from earth-abundant water and air over organo-based semiconducting materials is a promising alternative to the traditional anthraquinone (AQ) method. However, the generally hydrophobic nature of organic semiconductors has led to their poor dispersibilities in aqueous systems, which built huge barriers for photon capture and reactant contact in water-based photocatalysis. Aiming at this issue, this study reports the facile synthesis of AQ-based porous aromatic frameworks (AQ-PAFs) by coupling AQ fragments with thiophene-derived linkers via robust carbon&#8211;carbon bonds. Remarkably, the interfacial hydrogen bonding interactions between water molecules and AQ sites on the surface improve the general hydrophilicity of AQ-PAFs, which can be well-dispersed in water-only systems with uniform particle size distributions. Moreover, the AQ moieties also function as mediators of photoinduced electrons, and the protons produced from water oxidation reaction (WOR), which would kinetically favor the charge separation and subsequent electron transfer reactions. The mono-dispersed AQ-PAF photocatalyst promotes hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) photosynthesis from water and air under visible light achieving a high productivity of 7124&#160;&#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in the absence of any organic alcohol reagents among organic semiconductor photocatalysts. Furthermore, a continuous H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photosynthesis for 190&#160;h is also achieved in a flow system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Efficient and Durable Anode Catalyst Layer Constructed with Deformable Hollow IrOx Nanospheres in Low&#8208;Iridium PEM Water Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deformable hollow IrOx nanospheres as a structural&#8208;engineered catalyst architecture achieve an ultralow Ir packing density in anode catalyst layer while maintaining excellent catalytic activity and durability at reduced Ir loadings. The quasi&#8208;ordered close packing of hollow IrOx nanospheres simultaneously maximizes electrochemically active surface area, suppresses particle migration and agglomeration, and establishes percolated electron highways and rapid mass transport channels.








Abstract
Reducing iridium packing density (gIr&#160;cm&#8722;3 electrode) represents a critical pathway to lower geometric Ir loading in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs), yet conventional approaches often cause performance issues of anode catalyst layer due to decreased structural stability and limited electron/mass transport efficiency. Here, we present deformable hollow IrOx nanospheres (dh&#8208;IrOx) as a structural&#8208;engineered catalyst architecture that achieves an ultralow Ir packing density (20% of conventional IrO2 nanoparticle&#8208;based electrodes) while maintaining high catalytic activity and durability at reduced Ir loadings. Scalable synthesis of dh&#8208;IrOx via a hard&#8208;template method&#8212;featuring precise SiO2 nanosphere templating and conformal Ir(OH)3 coating&#8212;enables batch production of tens of grams. Through cavity dimension and shell thickness optimization, dh&#8208;IrOx demonstrates excellent mechanical resilience to necessary electrode fabrication stresses, including high&#8208;shear agitation, ultrasonic processing and hot&#8208;pressing. In the anode catalyst layer, the quasi&#8208;ordered close packing of dh&#8208;IrOx nanospheres simultaneously maximizes electrochemically active surface area, suppresses particle migration and agglomeration, and establishes percolated electron highways and rapid mass transport channels. The architected anode delivers high PEMWE performance (e.g., 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 @1.60&#160;V and 2&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 @1.75&#160;V@80&#160;&#176;C), while demonstrating excellent operational durability with&#160;&lt;1.5% voltage loss over 3000&#160;h.

         <title>Surface Nonbonding Oxygen State Regulation for Reversible Anionic Redox Chemistry in Li&#8208;Rich Mn&#8208;Based Layered Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface nonbonding oxygen state is modulated by an integrated surface structure engineering to stabilize anionic redox chemistry. The oxidized oxygen of the designed material cannot become O2 gas and escape, but rather exists more in the form of high&#8208;valence oxygen dimer anions, reducing the reaction extent of surface anionic redox and inhibiting oxygen loss.








Abstract
Activated by the Li&#8211;O&#8211;Li configuration with nonbonding O 2p state (lO2p), anionic redox reaction (ARR) in Li&#8208;rich layered oxides (LLOs) contributes to additional capacity but exhibits significant irreversibility, leading to severe surface oxygen loss. Herein, surface nonbonding oxygen state (SNBOS) is regulated by the integrated surface structure engineering to suppress surface oxygen loss and enhance the reversibility of ARR. On the outermost layer, the conversion of layered structure into a LiLaO2 layer and spinel phase structure eliminates lO2p, thereby preventing the activation of ARR and suppressing side reactions between electrolyte and oxidized oxygen ions. Besides, by introducing 5d metal La on the near surface, the energy of lO2p is decreased corresponding to the increased charge&#8208;transfer gap &#916; and the d&#8211;d coulomb repulsion term U is reduced, making U/2 decrease close to &#916; and enhancing ARR reversibility. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the oxidized oxygen of the modified sample cannot become O2 gas and escape, but rather exists more in the form of high&#8208;valence oxygen dimer anions O2n&#8722;$O_2^{n - }$, reducing the reaction depth of surface ARR and inhibiting oxygen loss. Therefore, the designed material demonstrates outstanding cycling stability and kinetics performance.

A readily prepared small molecule, 2,6&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;diethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyridine, enables rapid and highly sensitive &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescence detection of PFOA in water via liquid&#8208;phase extraction. Detection limits as low as 40 ppt in deionized water and 100 ppt in tap water are achieved using a smartphone&#8208;based color scan &#8220;app&#8221;.

Abstract
Mounting concerns regarding per&#8208;/poly&#8208;fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) on human health are focusing attention on trace&#8208;level PFAS detection in aqueous environments. Here, we report a readily prepared small molecule, 2,6&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;diethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyridine (receptor 1), that displays high binding affinities (logKa&#160;=&#160;4.9&#8211;6.2) and produces a strong &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; emission response when exposed to representative PFAS in hexanes. The hydrophobic nature of 1, and its strong affinity for various PFAS, allowed hexanes solutions of 1 to be used as &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; emission sensors for dilute aqueous solutions of long&#8208;chain (&#8805;C8) PFAS under acidic conditions (pH 2) by liquid&#8208;phase extraction (LPE). In the case of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), the response was rapid (under 10&#160;min) and sensitive. Limits of detection (LOD) as low as 250&#160;ppt were readily achievable by direct naked&#8208;eye observation. LOD as low as 40 and 100&#160;ppt, respectively, could be reached for deionized and tap water solutions of PFOA using a smartphone color&#8208;scanning application. Little change in the sensitivity was seen in the presence of a range of inorganic and organic species that could act as potential interferants. Support for the present findings came from UV&#8211;vis absorbance, fluorescence, 1H/19F NMR spectroscopic analyses, density functional theory calculations, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses.

         <title>Asymmetrical Triatomic Sites with Long&#8208;Range Electron Coupling for Ultra&#8208;Durable and Extreme&#8208;Low&#8208;Temperature Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hetero&#8208;trimetallic FeCoNi SA catalyst (FCN&#8208;TM/NC) processes the asymmetric FeN4 configuration, long&#8208;distance hetero&#8208;metallic electron coupling, modulated local microenvironment, and optimized d orbital energy levels, exhibiting extraordinary oxygen electrocatalysis. The zinc&#8211;air battery (ZAB) equipped with FCN&#8208;TM/NC exhibits ultra&#8208;stable rechargeability (over 5500&#160;h at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 under &#8722;60 &#176;C) and wide&#8208;temperature adaptability from &#8722;60 to 60&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Reversible zinc&#8211;air battery (ZAB) is a promising alternative for sustainable fuel cells, but the performance is impeded by the sluggish oxygen redox kinetics owing to the suboptimal adsorption and desorption of oxygen intermediates. Here, hetero&#8208;trimetallic atom catalysts (TACs) uniquely incorporate an electron regulatory role beyond primary and secondary active sites found in dual&#8208;atom catalysts. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and Raman spectroscopy elucidate Fe in FeCoNi SA catalyst (FCN&#8208;TM/NC) functions as the main active site, leveraging long&#8208;range electron coupling from neighboring Co and Ni to boost catalytic efficiency. The ZAB equipped with FCN&#8208;TM/NC exhibits ultra&#8208;stable rechargeability (over 5500&#160;h at 1&#160;&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 under &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C). The in&#8208;depth theoretical and experimental investigations attribute such superior catalytic activity to the asymmetric FeN4 configuration, long&#8208;distance electron coupling, modulated local microenvironment, optimized d orbital energy levels, and lower energy barrier for bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis. This work provides a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of the structure&#8208;reactivity relationship in TACs for energy conversion.

&lt;p&gt;The hetero-trimetallic FeCoNi SA catalyst (FCN-TM/NC) processes the asymmetric FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; configuration, long-distance hetero-metallic electron coupling, modulated local microenvironment, and optimized d orbital energy levels, exhibiting extraordinary oxygen electrocatalysis. The zinc&#8211;air battery (ZAB) equipped with FCN-TM/NC exhibits ultra-stable rechargeability (over 5500&#160;h at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; under &#8722;60 &#176;C) and wide-temperature adaptability from &#8722;60 to 60&#160;&#176;C.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reversible zinc&#8211;air battery (ZAB) is a promising alternative for sustainable fuel cells, but the performance is impeded by the sluggish oxygen redox kinetics owing to the suboptimal adsorption and desorption of oxygen intermediates. Here, hetero-trimetallic atom catalysts (TACs) uniquely incorporate an electron regulatory role beyond primary and secondary active sites found in dual-atom catalysts. In situ X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and Raman spectroscopy elucidate Fe in FeCoNi SA catalyst (FCN-TM/NC) functions as the main active site, leveraging long-range electron coupling from neighboring Co and Ni to boost catalytic efficiency. The ZAB equipped with FCN-TM/NC exhibits ultra-stable rechargeability (over 5500&#160;h at 1&#160;&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; under &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C). The in-depth theoretical and experimental investigations attribute such superior catalytic activity to the asymmetric FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; configuration, long-distance electron coupling, modulated local microenvironment, optimized d orbital energy levels, and lower energy barrier for bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis. This work provides a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of the structure-reactivity relationship in TACs for energy conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Structural Design in Cobaloxime&#8208;Integrated Covalent Organic Frameworks to Facilitate Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric structural design strategy has been developed to construct covalent organic frameworks (COFs) composed of ternary units and dual linkages to generate long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated states. By integrating the COF with cobaloxime complexes, the resulting hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular photocatalyst synergistically achieves spatially segregated redox sites and significantly enhances the photocatalytic overall water splitting efficiency.








Abstract
Herein, we report a hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular hybrid composed of a cobaloxime complex and a covalent organic framework (COF) that achieves photocatalytic overall water splitting. The designed COF features ternary units and dual linkages, which induce asymmetric linkers. Upon photoexcitation, this asymmetry facilitates directed electron transfer and spatially separated redox sites, resulting in a long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated state. Consequently, the COF, hydrogen&#8208;bonded with cobaloxime as a hydrogen (H2) production cocatalyst, enables visible&#8208;light photocatalytic overall water splitting, simultaneously producing H2 and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), outperforming the COFs with symmetric linker structures. This strategy of asymmetric structural design offers new insights for the design of photocatalysts with suppressed charge recombination for photocatalysis.

         <title>Constructing Biomimetic Channels in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework via Post&#8208;Synthesis for Enhanced Proton Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton transport in biological systems relies on amino acid residues with hanging carboxylic acids as proton donors and acceptors. Here, we first demonstrate that post&#8208;synthesis can create unoccupied carboxylic acid groups in HOFs, stabilizing water molecules and forming continuous proton channels. This strategy achieves 1000&#8208;fold enhancement in proton conductivity and the structure transformation was clearly revealed by crystallography.








Abstract
Proton transport channels in biological systems are constructed by the specific amino acid residues with hanging carboxylic acid groups acting as proton donors and acceptors, enabling rapid proton conduction via the Grotthuss mechanism. Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are promising candidates for artificially simulating proton channels due to their designable structure and abundant proton sources in the network. However, these protons were usually immobilized within hydrogen bonds between two building blocks, which require a high energy barrier for initiating proton transport. Post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) may be a viable solution to the above problems but has yet to be achieved in HOFs. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that unoccupied carboxylic acid groups can be created through post&#8208;synthesis which further stabilizes water molecules to construct continuous proton channels, bringing boosted proton conductivity by three orders of magnitude. The structure transformation process and the intermediate can be identified clearly by crystallography with an unveiled mechanism. This work offers a new approach to constructing biomimetic channels for proton conduction and HOF functionalization.

         <title>Organic Room&#8208;Temperature near&#8208;IR Phosphorescence Harvested by Intramolecular Through&#8208;Space Sensitization in Composite Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular energy transfer in bichromophore molecules, regulated by the spatial separation between organic and metal&#8208;containing components, allows to attain room temperature near&#8208;IR phosphorescence of polyaromatic dyes, including those with very low intersystem crossing rates, by using conventional organometallic fragments as sensitizers.








Abstract
A family of coordination compounds with short intramolecular spatial separation between an organic chromophore and a metal center was studied. The specific geometry was realized by means of anthracene&#8208;functionalized tertiary aryl phosphanes. Their silver and gold complexes (1, 2) operate as conventional fluorophores, with photophysical behavior defined by anthracene&#8208;localized allowed transitions. In contrast, bichromophoric species, containing phenyl bipyridine&#8208; (3, 5, 6, 8) or terpyridine&#8208; (4, 7) derived platinum(II) fragments, demonstrate fast intersystem crossing to the triplet state associated with the pincer metal component. Theoretical results corroborated that the short intramolecular distance between the platinum constituent and the adjacent anthracene facilitates subsequent through&#8208;space triplet (T2, pincer fragment)&#8594;triplet (T1, anthracene) energy transfer. This process occurs at a rate of &#8764;1011 s&#8722;1, surpassing the rates of T2&#8594;S0 relaxation. This prevents visible phosphorescence from the platinum(II) motifs but enables near&#8208;IR organic phosphorescence in the solid state, including dyes with very inefficient intersystem&#8208;crossing (ISC). Thus, the composite molecules 3&#8211;8 illustrate a feasible approach to the tunable sensitization of organic dyes and the design of low&#8208;energy triplet emitters.

         <title>A d&#8208;Electron Deficient Pd Trimer for Exceptional Pyridine Hydrogenation Activity and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel Pd trimer catalyst confined by the TiO2 lattice exhibits a 0.42 d&#8208;electron deficiency, effectively achieving nearly complete conversion of 2&#8208;phenylpyridine (PPY) to 2&#8208;phenylpiperidine (PPD) and maintaining performance over extensive use, with minimal activity or selectivity loss. This remarkable catalytic efficiency is attributed to the constrained adsorption of the pyridyl ring and the stabilization of the negatively charged transition state.








Abstract
The selective hydrogenation of pyridines containing reducible groups such as 2&#8208;phenylpyridine (PPY) typically has low yields due to strong nitrogen coordination with the metal as well as nonselective and over&#8208;hydrogenation. We report the synthesis of a novel Pd trimer catalyst through confined growth on an ordered mesoporous carrier, characterized by a 0.42 d&#8208;electron deficiency to address this challenge. This catalyst achieved a nearly complete conversion of 2&#8208;phenylpyridine and selectivity to 2&#8208;phenylpiperidine (PPD), maintaining its performance across eight batch cycles and continuous flow in the liquid phase for 800&#160;h with negligible loss of activity or selectivity. We discuss the roles of active sites, including Pd d charge and ensemble structure, in relation to activation entropy, a Hammett study, and the adsorption configuration of the reactant. The exceptional 2&#8208;phenylpyridine hydrogenation activity and selectivity are attributed to the adsorption constraint of the pyridyl ring and the stabilization of the negatively charged transition state in the rate&#8208;determining step produced by the d&#8208;electron deficient Pd trimer.

Encapsulating chemically unstable organometallic single&#8208;molecule magnets in single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes not only improves their chemical stability but also suppresses magnetic relaxation at zero magnetic fields, greatly improving their usability, which is essential for fabricating spintronic devices.








Abstract
An air&#8208;sensitive DyCp3 (Cp&#8722;&#160;= cyclopentadienyl) single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) complex (1) is encapsulated into single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) to construct hybrid materials that are resistant to moisture and oxygen. The hybrid materials with independent slow&#8208;magnetic&#8208;relaxing centers are expected to become a key component of the next generation of information process devices based on spintronics. The resilience to moisture and oxygen further broadens its manufacturing methods and application scenarios. Furthermore, upon encapsulation into SWCNTs, DyCp3 exhibited clear ac frequency dependence in the ac magnetic susceptibility at a zero&#8208;dc field. This indicates that the guest molecule's slow magnetic relaxation properties are preserved, which is crucial and necessary to realize SMMs&#8208;based quantum information processing, by allowing a sufficient time window for quantum gate operations. This result exemplifies that encapsulation of air&#8208;sensitive organometallic SMMs into SWCNTs enhances their chemical stability and their magnetic relaxation time at a zero&#8208;dc magnetic field, which provides a novel method for their further applications.

         <title>Switchable Divergent Photocatalytic C&#8208;Glycosylation of Glycosyl Benzoates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel radical deoxygenation C&#8208;glycosylation method using simple, stable glycosyl benzoates via reductive anomeric C&#9472;O bond cleavage enables divergent synthesis of alkyl and alkenyl C&#8208;glycosides with excellent stereoselectivity. This study highlights the innovative use of glycosyl benzoates as radical precursors and CO2&#8226;&#8722; as a reductant, opening new directions for radical glycosylation.








Abstract
Metabolically robust C&#8208;glycosides are crucial in various biological and medical applications, underscoring the need for efficient synthesis methods. While radical C&#8208;glycosylation reactions are known for their reliability and functional group tolerance, challenges such as glycosyl donor stability and atom economy persist. In this study, we investigate the underexplored potential of condition&#8208;controlled divergent synthesis of C&#8208;glycosides through a switchable photocatalytic C&#8208;glycosylation strategy, involving reductive anomeric C&#9472;O bond cleavage. Utilizing simple, readily available, and bench&#8208;stable glycosyl benzoates as novel O&#8208;based glycosyl radical precursors, we successfully achieve deoxygenative glycosylation of simple alkenes and styryl boronic acids, establishing a versatile platform for C&#8208;glycoside synthesis. A critical aspect of the challenging reductive cleavage of these benzoate esters is the introduction of strong single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) reductants, combined with Br&#248;nsted acids to accelerate fragmentation following substrate reduction. Notably, CO2&#8226;&#8722;, generated via the consecutive photon&#8208;induced electron transfer process, is utilized for the first time in glycosylation reactions. By meticulously tuning the reaction conditions, including photocatalysts and formate additives, we facilitate the divergent synthesis of alkyl and alkenyl C&#8208;glycosides with good to high stereoselectivity and yields. Mechanistic studies provide insight into the reaction pathway and the underlying rationale behind this finely tuned, easily controlled photocatalytic system.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Free High&#8208;Entropy Alloy for Acidic Water Oxidation at High Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;iridium high&#8208;entropy RuMnFeMoCo alloy catalyst with synergistic effects of different transition metal elements accelerates reaction kinetics and reduces overpotential of acidic oxygen evolution reactions, leading to the superior activity and stability in industrial proton exchange membrane water electrolysis at high current densities.








Abstract
Designing active and cost&#8208;effective catalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critically important for improving proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) used in hydrogen production. In this study, we introduce a rapid and straightforward method to synthesize a quinary high&#8208;entropy ruthenium&#8208;based alloy (RuMnFeMoCo) for acidic OER. This iridium&#8208;free catalyst demonstrates a low overpotential of 170&#160;mV and exceptional stability, enduring a 1000&#8208;hour durability test at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#160;M H2SO4. Microstructural analyses and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the incorporation of corrosion&#8208;resistant elements such as Ru, Mo, and Co enhances the overall stability of the catalyst under acidic conditions. Concurrently, the presence of Mn, Fe, and Co significantly reduces the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step in the OER process, thus accelerating the OER kinetics and lowering the overpotential. The PEMWE employing the RuMnFeMoCo catalyst operates stably at high current densities of 500 and 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for over 300&#160;hours with negligible performance degradation. This work illustrates a strategy for designing high&#8208;performance OER electrocatalysts by synergistically integrating the benefits of multiple elements, potentially overcoming the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off typically encountered in the catalyst development.

Here, we report that enones can serve as diverse alkylidene sources for catalyst&#8208;controlled selective C&#9472;H alkylation and/or alkylidenation of various nucleophiles. Treatment of a mixture of ketone (or lactam), enone, and diarylmethanol, with a catalytic amount of Y[N(TMS)2]3, gave the corresponding &#945;&#8208;C&#9472;H bond alkylation products derived from the alkylidene transfer from enones to ketones/lactams, whereas the reaction of enones with various C&#8208;nucleophiles in the presence of KOH as a catalyst resulted in C&#9472;H alkylidenation. Moreover, the application of these strategies for the late&#8208;stage modification or structural simplification of some bioactive molecules is also presented. These alkylidene transfer reactions are characterized by operational simplicity, mild reaction conditions, and remarkable catalyst&#8208;controlled product outcomes. These results not only demonstrate a significant potential for easily accessible and recyclable enones to serve as versatile alkylidene sources in C&#9472;H alkylation and alkylidenation but also provide an attractive and concise method for hydrodealkylidenation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes.

         <title>Integrating Electronic&#8208;Storage Piperazine into Covalent Organic Frameworks for Promoting Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The piperazine units were first adopted to construct catalytic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for oxygen reduction reactions. The electronic&#8208;storage feature promoted the electrons transferring from the electrodes to active catalytic sites and thus contributed to high activity.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;free covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as potential electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in new environmental&#8208;friendly electrochemical energy conversion technologies. However, their catalytic activity is hindered by inefficient electron transfer from electrodes to catalytic sites along extended frameworks. To overcome this bottleneck, herein, we first incorporated redox&#8208;active piperazine units into the COFs to catalyze ORR. The redox&#8208;active piperazine units enable to storage electrons, thus accelerate the electron transfer to the catalytic sites. Furthermore, the introduction of &#9472;OH group&#8208;containing building blocks induces keto&#8208;enol tautomerism (enabling reversible &#9472;OH / &#9472;C&#9552;O interconversion), improving framework polarity with a dipole moment of 6.87&#160;Debye (5.8 times increase compared to non&#8208;hydroxylated COFs). This polarity enhancement strengthens the intermediates binding ability, thereby improving the catalytic activity. As a result, the optimized PD&#8208;COF&#8208;OH exhibits a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.76&#160;V, turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.045&#160;s&#8722;1, and electrochemically active surface area of 9.4&#160;mF&#160;cm&#8722;2, surpassing most reported metal&#8208;free COFs. Theoretical calculations further reveal synergistic roles of &#9472;OH and &#9472;C&#9552;O groups in stabilizing OOH* and OH* intermediates, contributing to the improved catalytic activity. This work establishes a novel design paradigm for catalytic COFs through a rational integration of electron reservoir units and tautomerism&#8208;enabled polarity modulation.

         <title>Polarization&#8208;Induced Quantum Confinement of Negative Charge Carriers by Organic Nanoporous Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excess&#8208;electrons in organic nanoporous systems&#8212;nanohoops, their assemblies, and COFs&#8212;can be confined and transported via diffuse states stabilized by long&#8208;range polarization forces. These nanopore&#8208;bound states, localized in nanopores or away from molecular scaffolds, exhibit enhanced electron coupling and nearly&#8208;free&#8208;electron bands, unlike traditional skeletal&#8208;bound states, thus presenting a promising pathway for electron transport.








Abstract
We characterize the attachment of excess&#8208;electrons to organic nanoporous systems such as molecular nanohoops and models of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) using many&#8208;body methods. All the nanopore systems exhibit diffuse electronic states where the excess&#8208;electron is bound to the molecular scaffold via long&#8208;range polarization forces, and the excess&#8208;electron is predominantly localized in the interior of the nanopore or away from the molecular scaffold. Such &#8220;nanopore&#8208;bound&#8221; states show an enhanced electron&#8208;transfer coupling compared to more strongly&#8208;bound skeletal&#8208;states (or valence&#8208;bound states), where the excess&#8208;electron is confined to the molecular skeleton. For 1D assemblies of nanohoops, the bands formed from nanopore&#8208;bound states have a consistent nearly&#8208;free&#8208;electron character, indicating an efficient excited&#8208;state pathway for charge&#8208;carriers, while the bands from skeletal&#8208;states have higher effective mass along certain lattice directions. The nanopore&#8208;bound states show distinct size&#8208;dependent variations in electron affinities compared to skeletal&#8208;states and previously observed molecular quantum corral states. We conclude that nanopore&#8208;bound states emerge from polarization&#8208;induced quantum confinement, forming a distinct common feature of organic nanoporous matter with potential for efficient&#160;electron&#8208;transport.

         <title>Switching on Supramolecular DNA Junction Binding Using a Human Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stimulus responsive control of DNA junction formation: Enzyme action cleaves flexible arms from a metallo&#8208;supramolecular cylinder, transforming an inert metallo&#8208;supramolecular structure into an active metallo&#8208;supramolecular agent, and switching on its ability to assemble, bind and stabilize DNA three&#8208;way junction structures.








Abstract
Non&#8208;canonical DNA junction structures are important in human disease and in nucleic acid nanoscience and there is a growing interest in how to bind and modulate them. A key next step is to exert &#8220;on command&#8221; control over such binding. Herein we develop a new metallo&#8208;supramolecular triple&#8208;helicate cylinder agent that is inert to DNA junction binding until activated by human enzyme NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and its cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). This inactive cylinder bears six flexible arms each with a quinone group at the termini. Reduction by the enzyme leads to all six arms being removed, transforming the inert cylinder into a new and active metallo&#8208;supramolecular agent that binds junctions. This gives the ability to &#8220;switch&#8208;on&#8221; DNA junction formation and binding in response to the presence of two external stimuli &#8211; a human enzyme overexpressed in many disease states, and NADPH &#8211; and absence of inhibitor, giving NAND logic control. Modelling indicates the binding activation originates not in steric unblocking but changes in conformational flexibility. The work provides the foundation for and a route map toward future designs of sophisticated, inert, and supramolecular structures which are transformed by enzymes into new, active, and supramolecular structures for a variety of potential applications.

         <title>Vanillin&#8208;Derived Degradable and Reprocessable Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Epoxy Resins with High Intrinsic Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The demand for high&#8208;functionality and miniaturized consumer electronics is driving the development of polymer packing materials with intrinsic high thermal conductivity. Herein, a novel vanillin&#8208;based liquid&#8208;crystalline epoxy monomer (BEP) and three curing agents (ICA&#8208;1, ICA&#8208;2 and ICA&#8208;3) containing conjugated aromatic imine structures were synthesized.&#160;The results of X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements show that the structure orderliness of the epoxy resins based on BEP and ICAs increases with the number of conjugated benzene rings in ICAs. Compared with the conventional epoxy reference (0.23 W&#183;m&#8315;&#185;&#183;K&#8315;&#185;), the prepared liquid&#8208;crystalline epoxy resins exhibit enhanced intrinsic thermal conductivity (0.28&#8208;0.38 W&#183;m&#8315;&#185;&#183;K&#8315;&#185;) due to the synergistic effect from the liquid crystal phase structure in BEP and the additional ordered structure (via &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking) in ICAs. Both experimental and molecular dynamics calculation results&#160;show that the thermal conductivity of the epoxy resins is proportional to the length of the conjugated&#160;structures in ICAs. Owing the incorporation of dynamic aromatic imine bonds, the three cured epoxy resins based on BEP and ICAs demonstrate excellent reprocessibility through imine metathesis, and are chemically degradable in the amine solution.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Solution&#8208;processed metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have been rapidly developed worldwide, with much attention to fluid dynamic, fluid crystallization, and fluid interfaces, all falling within the realm of fluid chemistry. It is widely recognized that the theory of fluid chemistry has been proven to provide an effective means for the improvement of perovskite crystallization and the enhancement of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) performance. In this review, the fluid behavior and aging process of perovskite materials are first investigated, with emphasis on the related improvement methods and chemical mechanisms. Secondly, the internal crystallization chemistry, external interface chemistry and the large&#8208;area PSCs based on the fluid chemistry are discussed. Finally, four specific directions for future studies of fluid chemistry of MHPs are proposed, aiming to harness the theoretical advantages of fluid chemistry and contribute to the industrialization of PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Metalized Porphyrin&#8208;Based COFs for Conductive Porous Layers in Perovskite Solar Cells to Enhance Electron Injection, Defect Passivation and Lead&#8208;Protection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the introduction of an intermediate layer to bridge the transport and photoactive layers has become a key strategy for enhancing carrier extraction efficiency. However, traditional approaches are often limited by the seesaw effect, making it challenging to achieve an optimal balance between electron transport and defect passivation. In this study, we employed a Cu2+&#8208;loaded metalized porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework (Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;COF) as a conductive porous layer (CPL) at the perovskite bottom interface. Experimental results showed that a Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;COF coverage of 19% significantly enhanced electron transport and effectively suppressed long&#8208;distance electron diffusion. Moreover, the carefully designed Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;COF provided abundant active sites, which improved the film&#8208;forming quality of the perovskite layer, thereby facilitating the beneficial synergy of electron injection and defect passivation. The n&#8208;i&#8208;p type devices achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.41% (0.09 cm2) and 21.99% (1.01 cm2). Using Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;COF to stabilize the perovskite crystal structure, the unencapsulated devices retained over 83% of its initial efficiency after 2000 hours. Additionally, Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;COF effectively chelated lead ions and thus enhanced the environmental sustainability of PSCs.</dc:description>

The n-i-p type devices achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.41% (0.09 cm2) and 21.99% (1.01 cm2). Using Cu-Por-COF to stabilize the perovskite crystal structure, the unencapsulated devices retained over 83% of its initial efficiency after 2000 hours. Additionally, Cu-Por-COF effectively chelated lead ions and thus enhanced the environmental sustainability of PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>&#8220;Crystallinity Wave&#8221;&#8208;Driven Synthesis of Hollow Multi&#8208;Shell Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hollow multi&#8208;shell covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with abundant modular interfaces, high loading capacity, and various microenvironments are expected to hold great potential for chemical separation, heterogeneous catalysis, and energy storage/conversion. However, the synthetic methodology of COF hollow multi&#8208;shell nanoarchitectures has not been established. Herein, we demonstrate an ingenious &#8220;crystallinity wave&#8221;&#8208;induced regional difference ripening strategy to synthesize a series of hollow multi&#8208;shell COF particles with controllable shell numbers and shell thickness. The methodology relies on the isolation effect of the local crystalline COF thin layer inserted between the two layers of amorphous covalent organic polymer by the short&#8208;time Ostwald ripening, so that different regions of the particles exhibit distinct reaction stages before reaching chemical equilibrium in the subsequent dynamic imine exchange reaction, and then regions that tend to hydrolyze dissolve during the complete ripening process to form a hollow multi&#8208;shell structure. Remarkably, this strategy can be extended to prepare other hollow multi&#8208;shell COFs by altering monomers. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application, the obtained hollow multi&#8208;shell COFs are used as the electrode materials for supercapacitor. Benefiting from the short mass transfer path of hollow multi&#8208;shell structure, ordered channel of COFs, and their high surface area, the as&#8208;prepared particles exhibit remarkably enhanced specific capacitance.</dc:description>

         <title>B &#8592; N Lewis Pair Fusion of N,N&#8208;Diaryldihydrophenazines: Effect on Structural, Electronic, and Emissive Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Doping of PAHs with boron and/or nitrogen is emerging as a powerful tool to tailor the electronic structure and photophysical properties. As N&#8208;doped analogues of anthracene, N,N&#8208;dihydrophenazines play important roles as redox mediators, battery materials, luminophores, and photoredox catalysts. While benzannulation has been used successfully as a structural constraint to control the excited state properties, fusion of the N&#8208;aryl groups to the phenazine backbone has rarely been explored. Herein, we report the first examples of dihydrophenazines in which the N&#8208;aryl groups are fused to the phenazine backbone via B&#8592;N Lewis pair formation. This results in structural rigidification, locking the molecules in a bent conformation, while also modulating the electronic structure through molecular polarization. B&#8208;N fusion in BNPz1&#8208;BNPz3 induces a quinoid resonance structure with significant C&#8208;N(py) double bond character and reduces the antiaromatic character of the central pyrazine ring. Borylation also lowers the HOMO/LUMO energies and engenders bathochromic shifts in the emission. Further rigidification in the solid state gives rise to enhanced emission quantum yields, consistent with aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) observed upon water addition to solutions in THF. The demonstrated structural control and fine&#8208;tuning of optoelectronic properties is of great significance to potential application as emissive materials and in photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stepwise one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron reduction of the dimeric germole&#8208;ligated sandwich complexes [(&#951;5&#8208;CpGe)M(&#951;5&#8208;Cpttt)]2 (M&#160;=&#160;Y, Gd, Dy) produces the isostructural complex anions [{(&#951;5&#8208;CpGe)M(&#951;5&#8208;Cpttt)}2]&#8722; and [{(&#951;5&#8208;CpGe)M(&#951;5&#8208;Cpttt)}2]2&#8722;, respectively. The additional electrons populate bonding molecular orbitals extending across the {M2Ge2} rings, resulting in four&#8208;center, multielectron bonding.








Abstract
Reduction of the germole&#8208;ligated sandwich complexes [(&#951;5&#8208;CpGe)M(&#951;5&#8208;Cpttt)]2 (1M, M&#160;=&#160;Y, Gd, Dy) with one or two equivalents of KC8/2.2.2&#8208;cryptand produces [{(&#951;5&#8208;CpGe)M(&#951;5&#8208;Cpttt)}2]&#8722; (2M) and [{(&#951;5&#8208;CpGe)M(&#951;5&#8208;Cpttt)}2]2&#8722; (3M), respectively, as salts of [K(2.2.2&#8208;cryptand)]+ (CpGe = [GeC4&#8208;2,5&#8208;(SiMe3)2&#8211;3,4&#8208;Me2]2&#8722;, Cpttt&#160;=&#160;1,2,4&#8208;C5tBu3H2. X&#8208;ray crystallography shows that the bond lengths within the central {M2Ge2} rings contract markedly with each reduction. Computational analysis reveals the presence of unusual four&#8208;center, multielectron {M2Ge2} bonds, with the reduction increasing the germanium&#8211;germanium and metal&#8211;germanium bond orders while reducing the metal&#8208;Cpttt bond order. Analysis of 2Y by EPR spectroscopy reveals delocalization of the unpaired spin across both yttrium centers. Magnetic measurements on radical&#8208;bridged 2Gd show a large exchange coupling constant of &#8722;95 cm&#8722;1 (&#8722;2&#160;J formalism). Single&#8208;molecule magnet behavior is found for the dysprosium&#8211;germole complexes. Complexes 1Y, 2Y, and 3Y can be interconverted by one&#8208;electron oxidation or reduction reactions of 2Y, which itself can also be formed by comproportionation of 1Y and 3Y. The masked divalent reactivity of 3Y is demonstrated through one&#8208;electron reduction of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl to give [(&#951;5&#8208;CpGe)Y(&#951;5&#8208;Cpttt)(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipy)]&#8722; (4Y) and activation of Ph2Se2 to give [(&#951;5&#8208;CpGe)Y(&#951;5&#8208;Cpttt)(SePh)]&#8722; (5Y).

         <title>Ion&#8208;Docking Effect Enabling Rechargeable High&#8208;Voltage Magnesium&#8208;Iodine/Chlorine Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable magnesium (Mg) batteries represent a promising energy storage system by offering low cost and dendrite&#8208;less propensity. However, the limited selection of cathode materials, and often with low voltage and capacity, constrain Mg batteries. Herein, by exploiting the ion&#8208;docking effect between two halogen species &#8212; iodine cations (I+) and chlorine anions (Cl&#8208;) &#8212; we activate the cathodic activity of halogens and develop a magnesium&#8208;iodine/chlorine (Mg&#8208;I/Cl) battery prototype with high energy and power density. The ion&#8208;docking effect enables I+ and Cl&#8208; to mutually balance and disperse their charges, weakens the coordination strength between Cl&#8208; and Mg2+ while enhances the stability of I+, thus facilitating the multi&#8208;electron (2+1/3) redox reactions of halogens. We also find the solvation state of iodine species determine the reaction process of the I0/I3&#8208;/I&#8208; redox couples. The here&#8208;developed magnesium&#8208;iodine/chlorine battery features an impressively high discharge plateau of up to 3.0 V with a high capacity exceeding 400 mAh g&#8208;1, and demonstrates a stable lifespan for 500 cycles, with the ability of ultra&#8208;fast charging at 20C and low&#8208;temperature cycling under &#8208;30 &#176;C. These findings may provide new insights for developing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Mg battery systems.</dc:description>

Herein, by exploiting the ion-docking effect between two halogen species &#8212; iodine cations (I+) and chlorine anions (Cl-) &#8212; we activate the cathodic activity of halogens and develop a magnesium-iodine/chlorine (Mg-I/Cl) battery prototype with high energy and power density. The ion-docking effect enables I+ and Cl- to mutually balance and disperse their charges, weakens the coordination strength between Cl- and Mg2+ while enhances the stability of I+, thus facilitating the multi-electron (2+1/3) redox reactions of halogens. We also find the solvation state of iodine species determine the reaction process of the I0/I3-/I- redox couples. The here-developed magnesium-iodine/chlorine battery features an impressively high discharge plateau of up to 3.0 V with a high capacity exceeding 400 mAh g-1, and demonstrates a stable lifespan for 500 cycles, with the ability of ultra-fast charging at 20C and low-temperature cycling under -30 &#176;C. These findings may provide new insights for developing high-energy-density Mg battery systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Kinetic Redox Shotgun Proteomics Reveals Specific Lipopolysaccharide Effects on Intestinal Epithelial Cells, Mitigated by a Mn Superoxide Dismutase Mimic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proteomics and redoxomics are efficient to quantify the effects of bacterial lipopolysaccharide in intestinal epithelial cells (HT29) at the proteome and at the Cys&#8208;redoxome levels. Oxidative stress is the initial trigger of LPS leading to inflammation. A Mn&#8208;based superoxide mimetic (or mimic) was able to reduce oxidative stress and to mitigate the effects at the proteome level.








Abstract
Overproduction of reactive oxygen species and antioxidant superoxide dismutases (SOD1, SOD2) dysregulation contribute to chronic inflammation such as generated in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). A kinetic redox shotgun proteomic strategy (OcSILAC for Oxidized cysteine Stable Isotope Labelling by Amino acids in Cell culture) was used to explore the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) effects including LPS&#8208;induced oxidation and inflammation cascades on a dedicated intestinal epithelial cell line (HT29&#8208;MD2) together with the potential mitigating role of a Mn&#8208;based SOD&#8208;mimic Mn1. While LPS induced transient oxidative damages at early times (15&#160;min), cells incubated with Mn1 showed, in this time frame, a significantly reduced cysteine oxidation, highlighting Mn1 antioxidant properties. Over time, cysteine oxidation of LPS&#8208;treated cells was counteracted by an overexpression of antioxidant proteins (SOD1, NQO1) and a late (6&#160;h) preponderant increase in SOD2 level. Mn1, when co&#8208;incubated with LPS, attenuated the level of most LPS&#8208;modified proteins, that is, proteins involved in the inflammatory response. Our results highlight Mn1 as a potentially effective antioxidant and anti&#8208;inflammatory agent to consider in the treatment of IBD, as well as a useful tool for exploring the interconnection between oxidative stress and inflammation.

         <title>Blocking Orbital &#960;&#8208;Conjugation to Boost Spin&#8208;Orbit Coupling in Carbonyl&#8208;Embedded Polycyclic Heteroaromatic Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective approach, i.e., blocking orbital &#960;&#8208;conjugation via either molecular&#8208;structure distortion or meta&#8208;arrangement of chemical substituents is proposed, to boost spin&#8208;orbit couplings (SOC) in carbonyl&#8208;embedded polycyclic heteroatomic emitters. This work not only provides a deep insight into the structure&#8208;property relationship on SOC but also opens the door for designing more efficient OLED emitters with large SOCs.








Abstract
Both reducing singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps (&#916;ES1T1) and enhancing spin&#8208;orbit couplings (SOCs) are key to improving reverse intersystem crossing rates (kRISC) in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials. While considerable efforts have focused on reducing &#916;ES1T1, investigations on SOCs remain limited. Here, blocking &#960;&#8208;conjugation in carbonyl&#8208;embedded polycyclic heteroaromatic (PHA) molecules as potential approach to elevate &#960;&#960;* excitation energy, allowing its hybridization with n&#960;* excitation, thereby increasing SOCs is proposed. Two proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept isomers, DNDK&#8208;1 and DNDK&#8208;2 are synthesized, with different orientations of carbonyl units. DNDK&#8208;1 adopts a heavily twisted structure that hinders &#960;&#8208;conjugation, while DNDK&#8208;2 remains quasi&#8208;planar, maintaining stronger &#960;&#8208;conjugation. Experimental measurements reveals stark differences in their photophysical properties, with DNDK&#8208;1 exhibiting faster kRISC and much higher electroluminescence efficiency. The ab&#8208;initio calculations elucidate that hindered conjugation in DNDK&#8208;1 elevates &#960;&#960;* excitation energy, enabling n&#960;*&#8208;&#960;&#960;* mixing, thus significantly boosting SOCs. In contrast, smooth &#960;&#8208;conjugation in DNDK&#8208;2 leads to marginal n&#960;*&#8208;&#960;&#960;* mixing. In addition, utilizing groups composed of meta&#8208;arranged carbonyl&#8208;Ar&#8208;carbonyl and meta&#8208;arranged N&#8208;Ar&#8208;N units emerges as another approach to block &#960;&#8208;conjugation and enhance SOCs. This joint experimental and theoretical work provides promising pathways to enhance SOCs by blocking &#960;&#8208;conjugation, offering crucial insights for designing carbonyl&#8208;embedded PHA emitters with larger SOCs.
