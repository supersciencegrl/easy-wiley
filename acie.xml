      <title>Construction of Highly Active Metal&#8208;Containing Nanoparticles &amp; FeCo&#8208;N4 Composite Sites for Acid Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;containing nanoparticles (M&#8208;NPs) in metal/nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (M&#8208;N&#8208;C) catalysts have been considered hostile to acid oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Some works have confirmed that M&#8208;NPs can synergistically increase ORR activity in alkaline media. However, the relation between M&#8208;NPs and the active sites of metal coordinated with nitrogen (MNx) is hard to be established in acid medium due to the poor stability of M&#8208;NPs. Herein, we develop a strategy to successfully construct a new FeCo&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst containing the highly active M&#8208;NPs and MN4  composite sites (marked as M/FeCo&#8208;SAs&#8208;N&#8208;C). The enhanced catalytic activity and stability of M/FeCo&#8208;SAs&#8208;N&#8208;C is discovered in our systematic experiments. Moreover, theoretical calculation reveals that there is a strong interaction between M&#8208;NPs and FeN4  sites, which can favor ORR by activating the O&#8208;O bond, thus facilitating a direct 4e&#8208;  process. Those findings firstly shed light on the highly active M&#8208;NPs and FeN4  composite sites for catalyzing acid oxygen reduction reaction, and the relevant reaction mechanism is suggested.</dc:description>

      <title>Unusual Type II Polyketide Synthase System Involved in Cinnamoyl Lipid Biosynthesis</title>
      <dc:description>As a unique structural moiety in natural products, cinnamoyl lipid (CL), was proposed to be assembled  via  unusual type II polyketide synthases (PKSs). However, their biosynthetic machinery remains to be disclosed. Herein, we demonstrated the assembly line of CL compounds, youssoufenes, which is accomplished by a PKS system uniquely harbouring three phylogenetically different ketosynthase/chain length factor &#160;(KS/CLF) complexes (YsfB/C, YsfD/E, and YsfJ/K). Through  in vivo  gene inactivation,  in vitro  reconstitution, as well as intracellular&#160;tagged&#160;carrier&#8208;protein&#160;tracking&#160;(ITCT) strategy developed in this study, we successfully captured the isomerase&#8208;dependent ACP&#8208;tethered polyunsaturated chain elongation process. The three KS/CLFs were unravelled to modularly assemble different parts of the youssoufene skeleton, during which benzene ring closure happens right after ACP&#8208;tethered C18 polyene formation. Of note, the ITCT strategy would significantly contribute to disclosing the mysteries of carrier proteins&#8208;dependent biosynthetic machineries.</dc:description>

      <title>Probing cooperativity of N&#8208;terminal domain orientations in the p97 molecular machine: synergy between NMR and cryo&#8208;EM</title>
      <dc:description>The hexameric p97 enzyme plays an integral role in cellular homeostasis. Large changes to the orientation of its N&#8208;terminal domains (NTDs), corresponding to NTD&#8208;down (p97&#8208;ADP) or NTD&#8208;up (p97&#8208;ATP), accompany ATP hydrolysis. The NTDs in a series of p97 disease mutants interconvert rapidly between up and down conformations when p97 is in the ADP&#8208;bound state. While the populations of up and down NTDs can be determined from bulk measurements, information about the cooperativity of the transition between conformations is lacking. Here we use cryo&#8208;EM to determine populations of the 14 unique up/down NTD states of the homo&#8208;hexameric R95G disease&#8208;causing p97 ring, showing that NTD orientations do not depend on those of neighbouring subunits. In contrast, NMR studies establish that inter&#8208;protomer cooperativity is important for regulating the orientation of NTDs in p97 particles comprising mixtures of different subunits, such as wild&#8208;type and R95G, emphasizing the synergy between cryo&#8208;EM and NMR in establishing how the components of p97 function.</dc:description>

      <title>Reversible soft&#8208;mechanochemical control of biaryl conformations through crosslinking in a 3D macromolecular network</title>
      <dc:description>Tuning the dihedral angle (DA) of axially chiral compounds can impact biological activity, catalyst efficiency, molecular motor performance, or chiroptical properties. Herein, we report gradual, controlled and reversible changes in molecular conformation of a covalently linked binaphthyl moiety, within a 3D polymeric network by the application of a macroscopic stretching force. We managed a direct observation of the DA changes by measuring the circular dichroism signal of an optically pure BINOL&#8208;crosslinked elastomer network. In accordance with computed spectra, stretching the elastomer resulted in a widening of the DA between naphthyl rings when the BINOL was doubly&#8208;grafted to the elastomer network, while no effect was observed when a single naphthyl ring of the BINOL was grafted to the elastomer network. Combining both experimental and theoretical results, we have determined that ~170% extension of the elastomers led to the transfer of a mechanical force to the BINOL moiety of 2.5 kcal*mol  &#8208;1  *&#197;  &#8208;1  (~175 pN) in magnitude and results in the opening of the DA of BINOL up to ~130&#176;.</dc:description>

      <title>Preparation of Nafion&#174; Membranes for Reliable Ammonia Quantification in Nitrogen Reduction Reaction Experiments</title>
      <dc:description>This study highlights the importance of following a strict protocol for Nafion&#174; membrane pretreatment for electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction experiments. It is shown how atmospheric ammonia pollutions can be introduced to the experimental setup through the membranes, therefore, interpreted falsely as catalysis product from N  2  . The sources of ammonia contamination vary drastically between different locations worldwide and even within the same location between days depending on temperature, wind direction, fertilizer use and manure accumulation in its vicinity. The study shows that significant amounts of ammonium is accumulated in the membranes after commonly practiced pretreatment methods, where the amount depends on the ammonia concentration in the surrounding of the experiment. Therefore, we introduce a new pretreatment method which removes all the ammonium in the membrane. The membranes can be stored for several days but a short final step in the method needs to be carried out right before NRR experiments.</dc:description>

      <title>A Robust Au&#8208;C&#8801;C Surface: Toward Real&#8208;time Mapping and Accurate Quantification of Fe2+ in the Live Brain of AD Model</title>
      <dc:description>A robust surface between molecules and electrodes is very important for constructing molecular and electronic devices. Here, it was first found that Au&#8208;C&#8801; C bond showed the highest stability under biological conditions containing abundant thiols and the best electrochemical performance compared to Au&#8208;S and Au&#8208;Se bonds. The new finding was also confirmed by theorical calculation.

The present ratiometric strategy demonstrated high&#160;spatial resolution for real&#8208;time tracking of Fe  2+  in a dynamic range of 0.2&#8208;120 &#956;M. Finally, the microelectrode array with good biocompatibility was applied in imaging and biosensing of Fe  2+  in the different regions of live brain. Using our powerful tool, it was first discovered that the uptake of extracellular Fe  2+  into cortex and striatum was largely mediated by cyclic adenosine monophosphate&#160;(cAMP) through CREB&#8208;related pathway in AD mouse brain.</dc:description>

Using our powerful tool, it was first discovered that the uptake of extracellular Fe  2+  into cortex and striatum was largely mediated by cyclic adenosine monophosphate&#160;(cAMP) through CREB&#8208;related pathway in AD mouse brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Enzymatic Building Block Synthesis for Automated Solid Phase Glycan Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>Automated chemical oligosaccharide synthesis is an attractive concept that has been successfully applied to a large number of target structures, but requires excess quantities of suitably protected and activated building blocks. Here we demonstrate the use of biocatalysis to supply such reagents for automated synthesis. By using the promiscuous NmLgtB&#8208;B &#946;1&#8208;4 galactosyltransferase from Neisseria meningitidis we demonstrate fast and robust access to the LacNAc motif, common to many cell surface glycans starting from either lactose or sucrose as glycosyl donors. The enzymatic product was shown to be successfully incorporated, en bloc, into a tetrasaccharide target using automated assembly.</dc:description>

      <title>Redox Dyshomeostasis Strategy for Hypoxic Tumor Therapy  Based on DNAzyme&#8208;Loaded Electrophilic ZIFs</title>
      <dc:description>Redox   homeostasis  is one of the main reasons  for reactive oxygen species  (ROS) tolerance in hypoxic tumors, limiting ROS&#8208;mediated tumor therapy. Herein,  we propose a redox dyshomeostasis (RDH) strategy based on a nano&#8208;platform  FeCysPW@ZIF&#8208;82@CAT Dz to disrupt redox homeostasis and  apply  this strategy to improve ROS&#8208;mediated hypoxic tumor therapy. Once  endocytosed by tumor cells,  the catalase DNAzymes&#8208;loaded zeolitic imidazole framework&#8208;82 (ZIF&#8208;82@CAT Dz) shell can be degraded into Zn2+  as cofactors for CAT Dz&#8208;mediated CAT silencing and electrophilic ligands for glutathione (GSH) depletion under hypoxia, both of which lead to intracellular RDH and H2O2  accumulation.  These &#8220;disordered&#8221; cells show reduced resistance to ROS  and are effectively killed by ferrous cysteine&#8208;phosphotungstate (FeCysPW)&#8208;induced chemodynamic therapy (CDT).  In vitro  and  in vivo  data demonstrate that  the pH/hypoxia/H2O2  triple  stimuli&#8208;responsive nanocomposite can efficiently kill hypoxic tumors.

      <dc:description>Current approaches to design monodisperse protein assemblies require rigid, tight, and symmetric interactions between oligomeric protein units. Here, we introduce a new multivalent interaction&#8208;driven assembly strategy that allows flexible, spaced, and asymmetric assembly between protein oligomers. We discovered that two polygonal protein oligomers (ranging from triangle to hexagon) dominantly form a discrete and stable two&#8208;layered protein prism nanostructure via multivalent interactions between fused binding pairs. We demonstrated that protein nano&#8208;prisms with long flexible peptide linkers (over 80 residues) between protein oligomer layers could be discretely formed. Oligomers with different structures could also be monodispersely assembled into two&#8208;layered but asymmetric protein nano&#8208;prisms. Furthermore, producing higher&#8208;order architectures with multiple oligomer layers, for example, 3&#8208;layered nano&#8208;prisms or nanotubes, was also feasible.</dc:description>

      <title>Structural Phase Transitions of a Molecular Metal Oxide</title>
      <dc:description>The structural phase of a metal oxide changes with temperature and pressure. During phase transitions, component ions move in multi&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;oxygen networks. Such macroscopic structural events are robust to changes in particle size, even at scales of around 10 nm, and size effects limiting these transitions are particularly important in, for example, high&#8208;density memory applications of ferroelectrics. In this work, we examine structural transitions of the molecular metal oxide [Na@(SO  3  )  2  (  n  &#8208;BuPO  3  )  4  Mo  V  4  Mo  VI  14  O  49  ]  5&#8722;  (Molecule  1  ) at&#160;~2 nm, using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The Na  +  encapsulated in the discrete metal&#8208;oxide anion exhibited a reversible order&#8211;disorder transition with distortion of the Mo&#8211;O molecular framework induced by temperature. Similar order&#8211;disorder transitions were also triggered by chemical pressure induced by removing crystalline solvent molecules in the single&#8208;crystal state or by substituting the counter cation to change the molecular packing. Molecule  1  is&#160;the metal oxide in which a macroscopic structural transition has been observed.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The structural phase of a metal oxide changes with temperature and pressure. During phase transitions, component ions move in multi&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;oxygen networks. Such macroscopic structural events are robust to changes in particle size, even at scales of around 10 nm, and size effects limiting these transitions are particularly important in, for example, high&#8208;density memory applications of ferroelectrics. In this work, we examine structural transitions of the molecular metal oxide [Na@(SO  3  )  2  (  n  &#8208;BuPO  3  )  4  Mo  V  4  Mo  VI  14  O  49  ]  5&#8722;  (Molecule  1  ) at&#160;~2 nm, using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The Na  +  encapsulated in the discrete metal&#8208;oxide anion exhibited a reversible order&#8211;disorder transition with distortion of the Mo&#8211;O molecular framework induced by temperature. Similar order&#8211;disorder transitions were also triggered by chemical pressure induced by removing crystalline solvent molecules in the single&#8208;crystal state or by substituting the counter cation to change the molecular packing. Molecule  1  is&#160;the metal oxide in which a macroscopic structural transition has been observed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Deoxygenative Fluorination of Phosphine Oxides: A General Route to Fluorinated Organophosphorus(V) Compounds and Beyond</title>
      <dc:description>Fluorinated organophosphorus(V) compounds are a very versatile class of compounds, but the synthetic methods available to make them bear the disadvantages of 1) occasional handling of toxic or pyrophoric P(III) starting materials and 2) a dependence on hazardous fluorinating reagents such as XeF  2  . Herein, we present a simple solution and introduce a deoxygenative fluorination (DOF) approach that utilizes easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle phosphine oxides as starting materials and effectively replaces harsh fluorinating reagents by a combination of oxalyl chloride and potassium fluoride. The reaction has proven to be general, as R  3  PF  2  , R  2  PF  3  , and RPF  4  compounds (as well as various cations and anions derived from these) are accessible in good yields and on up to a multi&#8208;gram scale. DFT calculations were used to bolster our observations. Notably, the discovery of this new method led to a convenient synthesis of 1) new difluorophosphonium ions, 2) hexafluorophosphate salts, and 3) fluorinated antimony&#8208; and arsenic&#8208; compounds.</dc:description>

      <title>Template&#8208;Directed Quantitative One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Homochiral Helical Cages Enabling Enantioselective Binding</title>
      <dc:description>Molecular imprinting technique and dynamic covalent chemistry were implemented to achieve quantitative one&#8208;pot syntheses of homochiral helical cages inside aromatic foldamers. One&#8208;handed helical cages P&#8208;1, M&#8208;1, P&#8208;2 and M&#8208;2 were assembled from their precursors in the presence of appropriate templates (d&#8208;, l&#8208;tartaric acid, d&#8208; and l&#8208;sorbitol, respectively) via three sequential steps in one pot: imine&#8208;linked chain elongation, template&#8208;induced folding and [4+2] cycloaddition between helical turns. These helical cages were proven to enantioselectively bind chiral guests used as the templates, and the differences between the association constants of enantiomeric guests were up to more than two orders of magnitude. The structures and binding modes of the cages were fully characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray structures and 1H NMR spectroscopy.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Molecular imprinting technique and dynamic covalent chemistry were implemented to achieve quantitative one&#8208;pot syntheses of homochiral helical cages inside aromatic foldamers. One&#8208;handed helical cages P&#8208;1, M&#8208;1, P&#8208;2 and M&#8208;2 were assembled from their precursors in the presence of appropriate templates (d&#8208;, l&#8208;tartaric acid, d&#8208; and l&#8208;sorbitol, respectively) via three sequential steps in one pot: imine&#8208;linked chain elongation, template&#8208;induced folding and [4+2] cycloaddition between helical turns. These helical cages were proven to enantioselectively bind chiral guests used as the templates, and the differences between the association constants of enantiomeric guests were up to more than two orders of magnitude. The structures and binding modes of the cages were fully characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray structures and 1H NMR spectroscopy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A Strategy for Constructing Pore&#8208;Space&#8208;Partitioned MOFs with High Uptake Capacity for C2 Hydrocarbons and CO2</title>
      <dc:description>
Record&#8208;setting amounts of small hydrocarbon gas molecules such as acetylene and ethylene can be captured in a bimetallic cobalt&#8211;vanadium material synthesized by an unusual form of pore&#8208;space partition.







Abstract
Introduction of pore partition agents into hexagonal channels of MIL&#8208;88 type (acs topology) endows materials with high tunability in gas sorption. Here, we report a strategy to partition acs framework into pacs (partitioned acs) crystalline porous materials (CPM). This strategy is based on insertion of in&#8197;situ synthesized 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dipyridylsulfide (dps) ligands. One third of open metal sites in the acs net are retained in pacs MOFs; two thirds are used for pore&#8208;space partition. The Co2V&#8208;pacs MOFs exhibit near or at record high uptake capacities for C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, and CO2 among MOFs. The storage capacity of C2H2 is 234&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 (298&#8197;K) and 330&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 (273&#8197;K) at 1&#8197;atm for CPM&#8208;733&#8208;dps (the Co2V&#8208;BDC form, BDC=1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate). These high uptake capacities are accomplished with low heat of adsorption, a feature desirable for low&#8208;energy&#8208;cost adsorbent regeneration. CPM&#8208;733&#8208;dps is stable and shows no loss of C2H2 adsorption capacity following multiple adsorption&#8211;desorption cycles.

      <title>Colyliform Crystalline 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks with Quasi&#8208;3D Topologies for Rapid I2 Adsorption</title>
      <dc:description>Constructing three&#8208;dimensional (3D) structural characteristics on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is a smart approach to effectively improve the pore permeability and mass transfer rate of the materials and realize the rapid adsorption for guest molecules, while avoiding the high cost and monomer scarcity in preparing 3D COFs. Herein, we report for the first time a series of colyliform crystalline 2D COFs with quasi&#8208;three&#8208;dimensional (Q&#8208;3D) topologies, consisting of unique &#8220;stereoscopic&#8221; triangular pores, large interlayer spacings and flexible constitutional units which makes the pores elastic and self&#8208;adaptable for the object transmission. The as&#8208;prepared QTD&#8208;COFs have fairly faster adsorption rate (2.51 g/h) for iodine than traditional 2D COFs, with an unprecedented maximum adsorption capacity of 6.29 g/g. The excellent adsorption performance, as well as the prominent irradiation stability enable the QTD&#8208;COFs to be reliably applied to the rapid removal of radioactive iodine under special circumstances of emergency response to nuclear accidents.</dc:description>

      <title>Photoredox Catalysis Unlocks the Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cyanation of Aryl Halides under Benign Conditions</title>
      <dc:description>The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cyanations of aryl halides are among the most used methods for synthesizing aryl nitriles.

      <dc:description>The catalytic oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) to C2 hydrocarbons with oxygen (O  2  &#8208;OCM) has garnered renewed worldwide interest in the past decade due to the emergence of enormous new shale gas resources. However, the C2 selectivity of typical OCM processes is significantly challenged by overoxidation to CO  x  products. Other gaseous reagents such as N  2  O, CO  2  , and S  2  have been investigated to a far lesser extent as alternative, milder oxidants to replace O  2  .

      <title>Trapping Transient RNA Complexes by Chemically Reversible Acylation</title>
      <dc:description>RNA&#8208;RNA interactions are essential for biology, yet they can be difficult to study due to their transient nature. While crosslinking strategies can in principle be used to trap such interactions, virtually all existing strategies for crosslinking are poorly reversible, chemically modifying the RNA and hindering molecular analysis. Here, we describe a soluble crosslinker design (BINARI) that reacts with RNA via acylation. We find that it efficiently crosslinks noncovalent RNA complexes with miminal sequence bias and establish that the crosslink can be reversed by phosphine reduction of azide trigger groups, liberating the individual RNA components for further analysis. Use of the new approach is demonstrated by reversible protection against nuclease degradation and by trapping transient RNA complexes of E. coli DsrA&#8208;rpoS derived bulge&#8208;loop interactions, which underlines the potential of BINARI crosslinkers to probe RNA regulatory networks.</dc:description>

      <title>Selective Hydroperoxygenation of Olefin Realized by Coinage Multimetallic 1&#8208;nanometer Catalyst</title>
      <dc:description>The science of particles on a sub&#8208;nanometer (~ 1 nm) scale has attracted worldwide attention. However, this field of science has remained unexplored because of the technical difficulty in the precise synthesis of sub&#8208;nanoparticles (SNPs). Thus, we recently developed the &#8216;atom&#8208;hybridization method (AHM)&#8217; that precisely synthesizes the SNPs by using a suitably&#8208;designed macromolecule as a template. In this study, toward revealing this unexplored field, we newly investigated the chemical reactivity of alloy SNPs obtained by the AHM. Focusing on the coinage metal elements, the oxidation reaction of an olefin catalyzed by these SNPs was systematically evaluated. The SNPs showed a high catalytic performance even under the milder condition in contrast to conventional catalysts. Additionally, the hybridization of multiple elements enhanced the turnover frequency and the selectivity of the hydroperoxide derivative. We discuss the unique quantum&#8208;sized catalysts providing generally unstable hydroperoxides from the viewpoint of miniaturization and hybridization of the materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Rhizolutin, a novel 7/10/6&#8208;tricyclic dilactone, dissociates misfolded protein aggregates and reduces apoptosis/inflammation associated with Alzheimer&#8217;s disease</title>
      <dc:description>Rhizolutin (  1  ) was discovered as a natural product of ginseng&#8208;rhizospheric  Streptomyces  sp. WON17. Its structure featured an unprecedented 7/10/6&#8208;tricyclic dilactone carbon skeleton composed of dimethylcyclodecatriene flanked by a 7&#8208;membered and a 6&#8208;membered lactone ring based on spectroscopic analysis. During an unbiased screening of natural product libraries, this novel compound was found to dissociate amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) plaques and tau tangles, which are key pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD). Rhizolutin treatment of APP/PS1 double transgenic mice with AD significantly dissociated hippocampal plaques.  In vitro  , rhizolutin substantially decreased A&#946;&#8208;induced apoptosis and inflammation in neuronal and glial cells. Our findings introduce a unique chemical entity that targets A&#946; and tau concurrently by mimicking misfolded protein clearance mechanisms of immunotherapy, which is prominently investigated in clinical trials.</dc:description>

      <title>Ultrafast Semi&#8208;Solid Processing of Highly Durable ZIF&#8208;8 Membranes for Propylene/Propane Separation</title>
      <dc:description>ZIF&#8208;8 membrane has emerged as the most promising candidate for propylene/propane (C3H6/C3H8) separation due to its precise molecular sieving characteristics. The poor reproducibility and durability, high cost, thus far pose challenges on the scalable synthesis and industrial application of ZIF&#8208;8 membranes. Herein, we report a semi&#8208;solid process featured with ultrafast and high&#8208;yield synthesis, and outstanding scalability for reproducible fabrication of ZIF&#8208;8 membranes. The resultant membranes exhibit excellent C3H6/C3H8 separation performance in a wide range of temperature and pressure, and remarkable stability over a span of 6 months. The new ZIF&#8208;8 membrane features dimethylacetamide entrapped ZIF&#8208;8 crystals retainning same diffusion charactristics but offering enhanced adsorptive selectivity for C3H6/C3H8. The ZIF&#8208;8 membrane was successfully fabricated on commercial flat&#8208;sheet ceramic substrate. A prototypical plate&#8208;and&#8208;frame membrane module with effective membrane area of about 300 cm2  was implemented for efficient C3H6/C3H8 separation. Overall, the reliable reproducibility and durability as well as scalability of ZIF&#8208;8 membranes have greatly unlocked its commercialization potential.</dc:description>

Herein, we succeeded in controlling rotational isomerism of &#956;&#8208;oxo silicon phthalocyanine (SiPc) oligomers to achieve an external&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive orientational ordering using intermolecular interactions of tetrathiafulvalene (TTF).

Furthermore, a stable performance of oligomers as a cathode material in a Li&#8208;ion battery proved that the one&#8208;dimensionally stacked, rotatable structure of SiPc oligomers is useful to control the orientation of functional molecules toward molecular electronics.</dc:description>

      <title>Overcoming Fundamental Limitations in Adsorbent Design: Alkene Adsorption by Non&#8208;porous Copper(I) Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>Purifying alkenes from alkanes requires cryogenic distillation. At global scale, this consumes energy equivalent to countries of ca. 5 million people. Replacing distillation with adsorption processes would significantly increase energy efficiency. Trade&#8208;offs between kinetics, selectivity, capacity, and heat of adsorption have prevented production of an optimal adsorbent. We report adsorbents that overcome these trade&#8208;offs.  [Cu&#8208;Br]  3  and  [Cu&#8208;H]  3  are air&#8208;stable trinuclear complexes that undergo reversible solid&#8208;state inter&#8208;molecular rearrangements to produce dinuclear  [Cu&#8208;Br&#8226;(alkene)]  2  and  [Cu&#8208;H&#8226;(alkene)]  2  . The reversible solid&#8208;state rearrangement, confirmed  in&#8208;situ  using powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, allows adsorbent design trade&#8208;offs to be overcome, coupling low heat of adsorption (&#8208;10 to &#8208;17 kJ&#183;mol  &#8208;1  alkene  ), high alkene:alkane selectivity (47; 29), and uptake capacity (&gt;2.5 mol  alkene  &#183;mol  &#8208;1  Cu3  ). Most remarkably,  [Cu&#8208;H]  3  displays fast uptake and regenerates capacity within 10 minutes.</dc:description>

Compared with AIE dots that are larger than 25 nm, AIE QDs allow more efficient cellular uptake and imaging without surface modification of any membrane&#8208;penetrating peptides or other targeting molecules. NIR&#8208;II AIEgens, which have nearly no background fluorescence from organisms, are used to demonstrate that AIE QDs can achieve high contrast at the tumor as small as 80 mm  3  , and evade the liver more efficiently than AIE dots.

      <title>Bright infrared to ultraviolet and visible upconversion in small alkaline earth&#8208;based nanoparticles with biocompatible CaF2 shells</title>
      <dc:description>Upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) are promising candidates for photon&#8208;driven reactions, including light&#8208;triggered drug delivery, photodynamic therapy, and photocatalysis. Here, we investigate the NIR to UV and visible emission of sub&#8208;15 nm alkaline&#8208;earth rare&#8208;earth fluoride UCNPs (M  1&#8208;x  Ln  x  F  2+x,  MLnF) with a CaF  2  shell. We synthesize 8 alkaline&#8208;earth host materials doped with Yb  3+  and Tm  3+  , with alkaline&#8208;earth (M) spanning Ca, Sr, and Ba, MgSr, CaSr, CaBa, SrBa, and CaSrBa. We explore UCNP composition, size, and lanthanide doping dependent emission, focusing on upconversion quantum yield (UCQY) and UV emission. UCQY values of 2.46% at 250 W/cm  2  are achieved with 14.5 nm SrLuF@CaF  2  particles, with 7.3% of total emission in the UV. In 10.9 nm SrYbF:1%Tm  3+  @CaF  2  particles, UV emission increased to 9.9% with UCQY at 1.14%. We demonstrate dye degradation under NIR illumination using SrYbF:1%Tm  3+  @CaF  2  , highlighting the efficiency of these UCNPs and their ability to trigger photoprocesses.</dc:description>

In 10.9 nm SrYbF:1%Tm  3+  @CaF  2  particles, UV emission increased to 9.9% with UCQY at 1.14%. We demonstrate dye degradation under NIR illumination using SrYbF:1%Tm  3+  @CaF  2  , highlighting the efficiency of these UCNPs and their ability to trigger photoprocesses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Lithium Nitrate Regulated Sulfone Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>The electrolytes in lithium metal batteries have to be compatible with both lithium metal anodes and high voltage cathodes, which can be regulated by manipulating the solvation structure. Herein, to enhance the electrolyte stability, lithium nitrate (LiNO3) and HFE are introduced into the high&#8208;concentration sulfolane electrolyte to suppress Li dendrite growth and achieves a high Coulombic efficiency of &gt;99% for both Li anode and LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) cathodes. Molecular dynamics simulations show that NO3&#8208; participates in the solvation sheath of lithium ions enabling more TFSI&#8208; to coordinate with Li+. Therefore, robust LiNxOy&#8208;LiF rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI) is formed on Li surface, suppressing Li dendrite growth. The LiNO3&#8208;containing sulfolane electrolyte can also support highly aggressive LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) cathode, delivering a discharge capacity of 190.4 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.5C for 200 cycles with a capacity retention rate of 99.5%.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
Recent advances in the search for practical next&#8208;generation deep&#8208;UV NLO crystals are reviewed. The aim is to provide a clear perspective on the development of current deep&#8208;UV NLO candidates, and to accelerate the discovery of future candidates with high performance to meet the urgent demand.

Abstract
Advances in the generation of coherent lasers at wavelengths below 200&#8197;nm as well as the associated equipment and technologies have greatly spurred the development of nonlinear optical (NLO) materials that are capable of phase&#8208;matching in the deep&#8208;ultraviolet (deep&#8208;UV) spectral regions. However, few crystals can meet the technical demands, and studies to date have focused mainly on finding the next competitive candidates. Consequently, several crystals have emerged that hold great potential for the production of deep&#8208;UV harmonic coherent light, which benefit from newly developed systems with novel NLO&#8208;active units and chromophores. This Review provides a comprehensive overview of the developments of emergent candidates in the field of deep&#8208;UV NLO materials, discussing the recent efforts and active advances in the search for superior systems and in understanding their structure&#8211;property relationships. The intention is to provide a clear perspective on the current emergent deep&#8208;UV NLO candidates, and to accelerate the discovery of next candidates with high performances to meet the urgent demands.

Nanotechnology based on functional nucleic acids (FNAs) is an interdisciplinary field that builds on the interactions between FNAs and nanomaterials. In this Review, a number of common FNA nanomaterials are described along with their structures and applications.

Abstract
Functional nucleic acid (FNA) nanotechnology is an interdisciplinary field between nucleic acid biochemistry and nanotechnology that focuses on the study of interactions between FNAs and nanomaterials and explores the particular advantages and applications of FNA nanomaterials. With the goal of building the next&#8208;generation biomaterials that combine the advantages of FNAs and nanomaterials, the interactions between FNAs and nanomaterials as well as FNA self&#8208;assembly technologies have established themselves as hot research areas, where the target recognition, response, and self&#8208;assembly ability, combined with the plasmon properties, stability, stimuli&#8208;response, and delivery potential of various nanomaterials can give rise to a variety of novel fascinating applications. As research on the structural and functional group features of FNAs and nanomaterials rapidly develops, many laboratories have reported numerous methods to construct FNA nanomaterials. In this Review, we first introduce some widely used FNAs and nanomaterials along with their classification, structure, and application features. Then we discuss the most successful methods employing FNAs and nanomaterials as elements for creating advanced FNA nanomaterials. Finally, we review the extensive applications of FNA nanomaterials in bioimaging, biosensing, biomedicine, and other important fields, with their own advantages and drawbacks, and provide our perspective about the issues and developing trends in FNA nanotechnology.

However, new organic redox&#8208;active molecules with good chemical stability and high solubility are still desired for high&#8208;performance aqueous RFBs due to their low crossover capability and high abundance.

      <title>Electrochemically Induced MOF&#8208;Derived Amorphous V2O5 for Superior Rate Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>The electrochemical performance of vanadium oxide&#8208;based cathodes in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) depends on their crystal degree and composite state with carbon materials. Herein, an  in&#8208;situ  electrochemical induction strategy was developed to fabricate MOF&#8208;derived composite of amorphous V  2  O  5  and carbon materials (a&#8208;V  2  O  5  @C) for the first time, where the V  2  O  5  is amorphous state and uniformly distributed in carbon framework. The amorphous structure endows V  2  O  5  with more isotropic Zn  2+  diffusion routes and active sites, resulting in fast Zn  2+  transport and high specific capacity. The porous carbon framework provides continuous electron transport pathway and ion diffusion channels. As a result, the a&#8208;V  2  O  5  @C composites display extraordinary electrochemical performance. This work will pave the way for designing the cathodes of ZIBs with superior rate performance.</dc:description>

Herein, an  in&#8208;situ  electrochemical induction strategy was developed to fabricate MOF&#8208;derived composite of amorphous V  2  O  5  and carbon materials (a&#8208;V  2  O  5  @C) for the first time, where the V  2  O  5  is amorphous state and uniformly distributed in carbon framework. The amorphous structure endows V  2  O  5  with more isotropic Zn  2+  diffusion routes and active sites, resulting in fast Zn  2+  transport and high specific capacity. The porous carbon framework provides continuous electron transport pathway and ion diffusion channels. As a result, the a&#8208;V  2  O  5  @C composites display extraordinary electrochemical performance. This work will pave the way for designing the cathodes of ZIBs with superior rate performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Decarboxylative Borylation of Stabilized and Activated Carbon Radicals</title>
      <dc:description>Redox&#8208;active esters (RAEs) as active radical precursors have been extensively studied for C&#8208;B bond formations. However, the analogous transformations of stabilized radicals from the corresponding acid precursors remain challenging due to the strong preference towards single&#8208;electron oxidation to the stable carbocations. This work describes a general strategy for rapid access to various aliphatic and aromatic boronic esters by mild photoinduced decarboxylative borylation.

      <title>Jahn&#8208;Teller Disproportionation Induced Exfoliation of Unit&#8208;Cell Scale &#949;&#8208;MnO2</title>
      <dc:description>Exfoliation of nanosheet from non&#8208;layered bulk material is challenging because of the strong chemical bonds in lattice, rather than the weak van de Waals (vdW) interaction in the layered bulk counterparts. In this paper, we propose a top&#8208;down method to exfoliate &#949;&#8208;MnO2 nanosheets from a family of charge&#8208;ordered La1&#8208;xAExMnO3 (AE=Ca, Sr, Ba) perovskites, taking advantage of Jahn&#8208;Teller disproportion effect of Mn3+ and bond strength difference. The &#949;&#8208;MnO2 nanosheet (a thickness of 0.91 nm, two&#8208;fold of the unit cell along c&#8208;axis) crystalized into a nickel arsenide (NiAs) structure with ordered arrangement of 50% cation vacancy in reference to NiAs, which shows thermal metastability and the best water oxidation activity compared with other types of manganese oxide. The exfoliation mechanism has been reasoned as a synergistic proton&#8208;induced Mn3+ disproportionation and structural reconstruction. The stochastic surface walking (SSW) pathway calculation of energy and phase transformation suggested a proton&#8208;exchanged perovskite to birnessite route followed by the local reconstruction of MnO6 from perovskite skeleton. The synthetic method could also be potentially extended to the exfoliation of other two&#8208;dimensional nanosheet materials with non&#8208;layered crystal structures.</dc:description>

Herein, we investigate radical formation upon reacting FLP systems with dihydrogen, triphenyltin hydride or tetrachloro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (TCQ) both experimentally and computationally to determine the nature of the single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) events; i.e. being direct SET to B(C  6  F  5  )  3  or not. We show that the reactions of H  2  and Ph  3  SnH with archetypal P/B FLP systems do not proceed via a radical mechanism. In contrast, reaction with TCQ proceeds via SET, which is only feasible by Lewis acid coordination to the substrate. Furthermore, we highlight that SET from the Lewis base to the Lewis acid&#8211;substrate adduct may be prevalent in other literature examples of radical FLP chemistry, which provides important design principles for radical main&#8208;group chemistry.</dc:description>

      <title>Allosteric inhibition of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease &#8211; insights from mass spectrometry&#8208;based assays</title>
      <dc:description>Following translation of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA genome into two viral polypeptides, the main protease M  pro  cleaves at eleven sites to release non&#8208;structural proteins required for viral replication. M  Pro  is an attractive target for antiviral therapies to combat the coronavirus&#8208;2019 disease (COVID&#8208;19). Here, we have used native mass spectrometry (MS) to characterize the functional unit of M  pro  . Analysis of the monomer&#8208;dimer equilibria reveals a dissociation constant of  K  d  = 0.14 &#177; 0.03 &#181;M, revealing M  Pro  has a strong preference to dimerize in solution. Developing an MS&#8208;based kinetic assay we then characterized substrate turnover rates by following temporal changes in the enzyme&#8208;substrate complexes, which are effectively &#8220;flash&#8208;frozen&#8221; as they transition from solution to the gas phase. We screened small molecules, that bind distant from the active site, for their ability to modulate activity. These compounds, including one proposed to disrupt the catalytically active dimer, slow the rate of substrate processing by ~35%. This information was readily obtained and, together with analysis of the x&#8208;ray crystal structures of these enzyme&#8208;small molecule complexes, provides a starting point for the development of more potent molecules that allosterically regulate M  Pro  activity.</dc:description>
