         <title>Identification of kibdelomycin and related biosynthetic gene clusters and characterization of the C&#8208;branching of amycolose</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many bacterial natural products contain C&#8208;branched sugars, including components from the outer cell wall or antibiotically active metabolites. The enzymatic C&#8208;branching of keto sugars leading to longer side chains (&#8805;C2), is catalyzed by thiamine diphosphate (ThDP)&#8208;dependent enzymes. Chiral tertiary &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones are formed in this process. The ThDP enzymes that catalyze C&#8208;branching reactions belong to one of three enzymatic superfamilies: decarboxy&#173;lases, transketolases, and &#945;&#8208;ketoacid dehydrogenases 2, but branching of keto sugars has only been demonstrated for decarboxylases. In this study, we showed that an &#945;&#8208;ketoacid dehydrogenase is responsible for C&#8208;branching of the deoxyketo sugar amycolose in the biosynthesis of kibdelomycin in Kibdelosporangium sp. MA7385. In addition, we characterized an amino transferase in the same biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) that accepts a sterically demanding tertiary &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketone in a downstream reaction. Subsequently, we identified approximately 400 similar BGCs in silico, suggesting that there is a large diversity of possible ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes catalyzing the C&#8208;branching of keto sugars and subsequent modifications.</dc:description>

         <title>Fully Optical Control of Polarization Current Direction in a Cyanide&#8208;Bridged Trinuclear Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a remote and non&#8208;contact stimulus, light offers the potential for manipulating the polarization of ferroelectric materials without physical contact. However, in current research, the non&#8208;contact write&#8208;read (erase) process lacks direct observation through the stable current as output signal. To address this limitation, we investigated the photoinduced polarization switching capabilities of the cyanide&#8208;bridged compound [Fe2Co] using visible light, leading to the achievement of rewritable polarization. By subjecting [Fe2Co] crystals to alternating irradiation with 785 nm and 532 nm light, the polarization changes exhibited a distinct square wave pattern, confirming the reliability of the writing and erasing processes. Initialization involved exposing specific crystal units to 532 nm light for storing "1" or "0" information, while reading was accomplished by scanning the units with 785 nm light, resulting in brief current pulses for "1" states and no current signal for "0" states. This research unveils new possibilities for optical storage systems, paving the way for efficient and rewritable data storage and retrieval technologies, such as the next&#8208;generation memories.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Anisotropic Pd2Lab2Lcc2 and Pd2Lab2Lcd2 Type Cages by Heteromeric Completive Self&#8208;Sorting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pd(II)&#8208;based low&#8208;symmetry coordination cages possessing anisotropic cavities are of great interest. The common strategies employed to achieve such cages utilize either more than one type of symmetrical ligands (e.g., Laa, Lbb, etc.) or only one type of unsymmetrical ligand (e.g., Lab). To significantly enhance the anisotropy, we have designed two unsymmetrical bidentate ligands i.e., Lab and Lcd, aiming a low&#8208;symmetry Pd2Lab2Lcd2&#8208;type cage. It was accomplished by high&#8208;fidelity integrative self&#8208;sorting of two different low&#8208;symmetry cages having Pd2Lab4 and Pd4Lcd8&#8208;type architectures (homoleptic complexes of the designed ligands). Structural constraints and geometry complementarity in the ligand design drive the non&#8208;statistical exclusive self&#8208;assembly of the Pd2Lab2Lcd2&#8208;type cage. By taking advantage of the complemental geometries between ligands, a low&#8208;symmetry Pd2Lab2Lcc2&#8208;type cage was also obtained. Heteromeric completive self&#8208;sorting of three homoleptic assemblies (Pd2Lab4, Pd4Lcc8 and Pd4Lcd8&#8208;type cages) into an exclusive mixture of Pd2Lab2Lcd2 and Pd2Lab2Lcc2&#8208;type mixed ligated assemblies was demonstrated through cage&#8208;to&#8208;cage transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>A Functional Switch Between Asperfumene and Fusicoccadiene Synthase and Entrance to Asperfumene Biosynthesis through a Vicinal Deprotonation&#8208;Reprotonation Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The diterpene synthase AfAS was identified from Aspergillus fumigatiaffinis. Its amino acid sequence and &#8211; according to a structural model &#8211; active site architecture are highly similar to those of the fusicocca&#8208;2,10(14)&#8208;diene synthase PaFS, but AfAS produces a structurally much more complex diterpene with a novel 6&#8208;5&#8208;5&#8208;5 tetracyclic skeleton called asperfumene. The cyclisation mechanism of AfAS was elucidated through isotopic labelling experiments and DFT calculations. The reaction cascade proceeds in its initial steps through similar intermediates as for the PaFS cascade, but then diverges through an unusual vicinal deprotonation&#8208;reprotonation process that triggers a skeletal rearrangement at the entrance to the steps leading to the unique asperfumene skeleton. The structural model revealed only one major difference between the active sites: The PaFS residue F65 is substituted by I65 in AfAS. Intriguingly, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis experiments with both diterpene synthases revealed that position 65 serves as a bidirectional functional switch for the biosynthesis of tetracyclic asperfumene versus structurally less complex diterpenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Effect of Fullerene Guest and Counterion on the Structural Stability and Electrical Conductivity of Octahedral Metallo&#8208;Supramolecular Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metallo&#8208;supramolecular cages have garnered tremendous attention for their diverse yet molecular&#8208;level precision structures. However, physical properties of these supramolecular ensembles, which are of potential significance in molecular electronics, remain largely unexplored. We herein constructed a series of octahedral metallo&#8208;cages and cage&#8208;fullerene complexes with notably enhanced structural stability. As such, we could systematically evaluate the electrical conductivity of these ensembles at both single&#8208;molecule level and aggregated bulk state (as well&#8208;defined films). Our findings reveal that counteranions and fullerene guests play a pivotal role in determining the electrical conductivity of aggregated state, while such effects are less significant for single&#8208;molecule conductance. Both counteranions and fullerenes effectively tune the electronic structures and packing density of metallo&#8208;supramolecular assemblies, and facilitate efficient charge transfer between the cage hosts and fullerenes, resulting in a notable one order of magnitude increase in electrical conductivity of the aggregated state.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanically Interlocked Polyrotaxane Networks with Collective Motions of Multiple Main&#8208;Chain Mechanical Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Type I main&#8208;chain polyrotaxanes (PRs) with multiple wheels threaded onto the axle are widely employed to design slide&#8208;ring materials. However, Type II main&#8208;chain PRs with axles threading into the macrocycles on the polymer backbones have rarely been studied, although they feature special topological structures and dynamic characteristics. Herein, we report the design and preparation of Type II main&#8208;chain PR&#8208;based mechanically interlocked networks (PRMINs), based on which the relationship between microscopic motion of mechanical bonds on the PRs and macroscopic mechanical performance of materials has been revealed. The representative PRMIN&#8208;2 exhibits a robust feature in tensile tests with high stretchability (1680%) and toughness (47.5 MJ/m3). Moreover, it also has good puncture performance with puncture energy of 22.0 mJ. Detailed rheological measurements and coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulation reveal that the embedded multiple [2]rotaxane mechanical bonds on the PR backbones of PRMINs could undergo a synergistic long&#8208;range sliding motion under external force, with the introduction of collective dangling chains into the network. As a result, the synchronized motions of coherent PR chains can be readily activated to accommodate network deformation and efficiently dissipate energy, thereby leading to enhanced mechanical performances of PRMINs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Versatile Microfluidic Platform for Extravasation Studies Based on DNA Origami&#8212;Cell Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microfluidic device to study cancer cell extravasation that mimics the endothelial barrier using a porous membrane decorated with DNA origami nanostructures displaying adhesion peptides to circulating cancer cells. The device allows visualization of cell transmigration under physiological flow conditions, revealing influences of adhesion peptide type, spatial arrangement, and density on the extravasation of MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells.







Abstract
The adhesion of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) to the endothelial lumen and their extravasation to surrounding tissues are crucial in the seeding of metastases and remain the most complex events of the metastatic cascade to study. Integrins expressed on CTCs are major regulators of the extravasation process. This knowledge is primarily derived from animal models and biomimetic systems based on artificial endothelial layers, but these methods have ethical or technical limitations. We present a versatile microfluidic device to study cancer cell extravasation that mimics the endothelial barrier by using a porous membrane functionalized with DNA origami nanostructures (DONs) that display nanoscale patterns of adhesion peptides to circulating cancer cells. The device simulates physiological flow conditions and allows direct visualization of cell transmigration through microchannel pores using 3D confocal imaging. Using this system, we studied integrin&#8208;specific adhesion in the absence of other adhesive events. Specifically, we show that the transmigration ability of the metastatic cancer cell line MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 is influenced by the type, distance, and density of adhesion peptides present on the DONs. Furthermore, studies with mixed ligand systems indicate that integrins binding to RGD (arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartic acid) and IDS (isoleucine&#8208;aspartic acid&#8208;serine) did not synergistically enhance the extravasation process of MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells.

         <title>NETosis&#8208;Inspired Cell Surface&#8208;Constrained Framework Nucleic Acids Traps (FNATs) for Cascaded Extracellular Recognition and Cellular Behavior Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon pathogenic stimulation, activated neutrophils release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), capturing and killing microbes. Inspired by this, we introduce framework nucleic acid traps (FNATs), a DNA nanoplatform for dynamic molecule recognition and cellular behavior modulation. This platform visualizes extracellular activities and manipulates cell behaviors using programmable DNA devices.







Abstract
Upon pathogenic stimulation, activated neutrophils release nuclear DNA into the extracellular environment, forming web&#8208;like DNA structures known as neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which capture and kill bacteria, fungi, and cancer cells. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as NETosis. Inspired by this, we introduce a cell surface&#8208;constrained web&#8208;like framework nucleic acids traps (FNATs) with programmable extracellular recognition capability and cellular behavior modulation. This approach facilitates dynamic key chemical signaling molecule recognition such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is elevated in the extracellular microenvironment, and triggers FNA self&#8208;assembly. This, in turn, leads to in situ tightly interwoven FNAs formation on the cell surface, thereby inhibiting target cell migration. Furthermore, it activates a photosensitizer&#8208;capturing switch, chlorin e6 (Ce6), and induces cell self&#8208;destruction. This cascade platform provides new potential tools for visualizing dynamic extracellular activities and manipulating cellular behaviors using programmable in situ self&#8208;assembling DNA molecular devices.

         <title>Picturing the Gap Between the Performance and US&#8208;DOE's Hydrogen Storage Target: A Data&#8208;Driven Model for MgH2 Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a data&#8208;driven strategy, we developed models to illustrate the structure&#8208;performance relationships of MgH2&#8208;based materials in solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage. This model also shows the current gap between their performance and the US&#8208;DOE goal.







Abstract
Developing solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage materials is as pressing as ever, which requires a comprehensive understanding of the dehydrogenation chemistry of a solid&#8208;state hydride. Transition state search and kinetics calculations are essential to understanding and designing high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage materials by filling in the knowledge gap that current experimental techniques cannot measure. However, the ab initio analysis of these processes is computationally expensive and time&#8208;consuming. Searching for descriptors to accurately predict the energy barrier is urgently needed, to accelerate the prediction of hydrogen storage material properties and identify the opportunities and challenges in this field. Herein, we develop a data&#8208;driven model to describe and predict the dehydrogenation barriers of a typical solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage material, magnesium hydride (MgH2), based on the combination of the crystal Hamilton population orbital of Mg&#8722;H bond and the distance between atomic hydrogen. By deriving the distance energy ratio, this model elucidates the key chemistry of the reaction kinetics. All the parameters in this model can be directly calculated with significantly less computational cost than conventional transition state search, so that the dehydrogenation performance of hydrogen storage materials can be predicted efficiently. Finally, we found that this model leads to excellent agreement with typical experimental measurements reported to date and provides clear design guidelines on how to propel the performance of MgH2 closer to the target set by the United States Department of Energy (US&#8208;DOE).

         <title>Ternary Rotational Polyanion Coupling Enables Fast Li Ion Dynamics in Tetrafluoroborate Ion Doped Antiperovskite Li2OHCl Solid Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Knowledge on the Li ion dynamics associated with more than two types of polyanions is still lacking. In this work, a novel three&#8208;body responsive dynamics is stimulated by the ternary coupling of OH&#8722;, BF4&#8722; and Li2&#8722;O&#8722;H octahedron movements, which efficiently reduces the activation barrier and consequently improves the Li ion conductivity.







Abstract
Li&#8208;rich antiperovskite (LiRAP) hydroxyhalides are emerging as attractive solid electrolyte (SEs) for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries (ASSLMBs) due to their low melting point, low cost, and ease of scaling&#8208;up. The incorporation of rotational polyanions can reduce the activation energy and thus improve the Li ion conductivity of SEs. Herein, we propose a ternary rotational polyanion coupling strategy to fasten the Li ion conduction in tetrafluoroborate (BF4&#8722;) ion doped LiRAP Li2OHCl. Assisted by first&#8208;principles calculation, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, solid&#8208;state magnetic resonance and electrochemical impedance spectra, it is confirmed that Li ion transport in BF4&#8722; ion doped Li2OHCl is strongly associated with the rotational coupling among OH&#8722;, BF4&#8722; and Li2&#8722;O&#8722;H octahedrons, which enhances the Li ion conductivity for more than 1.8&#8197;times with the activation energy lowering 0.03&#8197;eV. This work provides a new perspective to design high&#8208;performance superionic conductors with multi&#8208;polyanions.

In situ polymerization techniques encapsulate sulfur within microporous imine polymers, addressing the sulfur&#8208;shuttle issue and boosting electrochemical performance. This innovative strategy marks a new direction for creating efficient sulfur&#8208;based cathodes in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries, essential for electronics and electric vehicles, predominantly use cathodes made from critical materials like cobalt. Sulfur&#8208;based cathodes, offering a high theoretical capacity of 1675&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and environmental advantages due to sulfur's abundance and lower toxicity, present a more sustainable alternative. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art sulfur&#8208;based electrodes do not reach the theoretical capacities, mainly because conventional electrode production relies on mixing of components into weakly coordinated slurries. Consequently, sulfur&#8216;s mobility leads to battery degradation&#8212;an effect known as the &#8220;sulfur&#8208;shuttle&#8221;. This study introduces a solution by developing a microporous, covalently&#8208;bonded, imine&#8208;based polymer network grown in situ around sulfur particles on the current collector. The polymer network (i) enables selective transport of electrolyte and Li&#8208;ions through pores of defined size, and (ii) acts as a robust host to retain the active component of the electrode (sulfur species). The resulting cathode has superior rate performance from 0.1&#8197;C (1360&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) to 3&#8197;C (807&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1). Demonstrating a high&#8208;performance, sustainable sulfur cathode produced via a simple one&#8208;pot process, our research underlines the potential of microporous polymers in addressing sulfur diffusion issues, paving the way for sulfur electrodes as viable alternatives to traditional metal&#8208;based cathodes.

         <title>Mechanical&#8208;Force&#8208;Induced Non&#8208;spontaneous Dehalogenative Deuteration of Aromatic Iodides Enabled by Using Piezoelectric Materials as a Redox Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a catalytic, non&#8208;spontaneous dehalogenation process for the deuteration of aryl iodides using BaTiO3 as a catalyst. This method achieves high levels of deuterium incorporation using only 2.0&#8197;equivalents of D2O, which additionally acts as an electron donor. Furthermore, deuteration enhances the biological activity of D&#8208;ipriflavone, markedly inhibiting osteoclast differentiation.







Abstract
The development of green and efficient deuteration methods is of great significance for various fields such as organic synthesis, analytical chemistry, and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we have developed a dehalogenative deuteration strategy using piezoelectric materials as catalysts in a solid&#8208;phase system under ball&#8208;milling conditions. This non&#8208;spontaneous reaction is induced by mechanical force. D2O can serve as both a deuterium source and an electron donor in the transformation, eliminating the need for additional stoichiometric exogenous reductants. A series of (hetero)aryl iodides can be transformed into deuterated products with high deuterium incorporation. This method not only effectively overcomes existing synthetic challenges but can also be used for deuterium labelling of drug molecules and derivatives. Bioactivity experiments with deuterated drug molecule suggest that the D&#8208;ipriflavone enhances the inhibitory effects on osteoclast differentiation of BMDMs in vitro.

         <title>Reconstructing Solvation Structure by Steric Hindrance&#8208;Coordination Push&#8208;Pull of Dipolymer&#8208;H2O&#8208;Zn2+ toward Long&#8208;life Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A long&#8208;chained dipolymer with steric hindrance and coordination reconstructs the Zn2+ solvation structure in liquid electrolyte by a balanced push&#8208;pull dynamic on Zn2+ and H2O, forms a dipolymer&#8208;inorganic hybrid SEI in situ, and regulates the electrochemical reduction kinetics, considerably prolonging the cycle life of aqueous zinc&#8208;metal batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;metal batteries are prospective energy storge devices due to their intrinsically high safety and cost effectiveness. Yet, uneven deposition of zinc ions in electrochemical reduction and side reactions at the anode interface significantly hinder their development and application. Here, we propose a solvation&#8208;interface attenuation strategy enabled by a frustrated tertiary amine amphiphilic dipolymer electrolyte additive. The configuration of superhydrophilic segments with covalently bonded lipophilic spacers enables coupled steric hindrance/coordination, which establishes a balanced push&#8208;pull dynamic of dipolymer&#8208;H2O&#8208;Zn2+. Such interplay reconstructs the solvation structure of Zn2+ and allows the formation of a stable dipolymer&#8208;inorganic hybrid solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer. This SEI layer effectively shields the zinc&#8208;metal anode from water and anions, significantly reducing side reactions. In addition, the dipolymer adsorbed at the zinc&#8208;metal anode interface regulates the interfacial electrochemical reduction kinetics and ensures uniform zinc deposition. As a result, the Zn&#8722;Zn symmetric cells with dipolymer&#8208;containing electrolyte exhibit remarkable cycling stability exceeding 5800&#8197;h (242&#8197;days). The Zn&#8208;NVO batteries and Zn&#8208;AC hybrid ion supercapacitors also deliver stable cycling for up to 1440&#8197;h (60&#8197;days) with high&#8208;capacity retention over 80&#8201;%. This research demonstrates the potential to facilitate the development and commercialization of zinc&#8208;based energy storage devices.

         <title>Ligand Meta&#8208;Anchoring Strategy in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Remarkable Promotion of Quantum Yields</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ligand meta&#8208;anchoring strategy is reported to promote the quantum yields of luminescent metal&#8211;organic frameworks through the restriction of intramolecular motions.







Abstract
Aggregation is a conventional method to enhance the quantum yields (QYs) of pure organic luminophores due to the restriction of intramolecular motions (RIM). However, how to realize RIM in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is still unclear and challenging. In this work, the ligand meta&#8208;anchoring strategy is first proposed and proved to be an effective and systematic approach to restrict the intramolecular motions of MOFs for the QY improvement. By simply shifting the substituent position in the ligand from para to meta, the QY of the resulting MOF is significantly enhanced by eleven&#8208;fold. The value is even higher than that of ligand aggregates, demonstrating the strong RIM effect of this ligand meta&#8208;anchoring strategy. The introduction of co&#8208;ligand induces the appearance of visible yellow room temperature phosphorescence with a lifetime of 222&#8197;ms due to the QY enhancement and the charge transfer between the donor and accepter units. The present work thus broadens the understanding of the RIM mechanism from a new perspective, develops a novel method to realize RIM and expands the applicable objects from pure organic materials to organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid materials.

         <title>Thermal&#8208;Driven Dispersion of Bismuth Nanoparticles among Carbon Matrix for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique thermal&#8208;driven strategy is proposed to re&#8208;disperse bismuth core into nanoparticles among porous carbon shell, inhibiting the aggregation to enhance the electrocatalytic activity and stability.







Abstract
The poor electrocatalytic stability and rapid deactivation of metal electrocatalysts are always present in the electrocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) due to the harsh reduction condition. Herein, we demonstrate the controllable dispersion of ultrafine bismuth nanoparticles among the hollow carbon shell (Bi@C&#8208;700&#8208;4) simply by a thermal&#8208;driven diffusion process. The confinement effect of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix is able to low the surface energy of bismuth nanoparticles against the easy aggregation commonly observed for the thermal treatment. On the basis of the synergistic effect and confinement effect between bismuth nanoparticles and carbon matrix, the highly dispersed active sites render the obviously improved electrocatalytic activity and stability for CO2 reduction into formate. The in situ experimental observations on the reduction process and theoretical calculations reveal that the incorporation of bismuth nanoparticles with nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix would promote the activation of CO2 and the easy formation of key intermediate (*OCHO), thus leading the enhanced electrocatalytic activity, with a Faradaic Efficiency (FE) of formate about 94.8&#8201;% and the long&#8208;time stability. Furthermore, the coupling of an anode for 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) in solar&#8208;driven system renders the high 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) yield of 81.2&#8201;%, presenting the impressive solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.

&lt;p&gt;A unique thermal-driven strategy is proposed to re-disperse bismuth core into nanoparticles among porous carbon shell, inhibiting the aggregation to enhance the electrocatalytic activity and stability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poor electrocatalytic stability and rapid deactivation of metal electrocatalysts are always present in the electrocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) due to the harsh reduction condition. Herein, we demonstrate the controllable dispersion of ultrafine bismuth nanoparticles among the hollow carbon shell (Bi@C-700-4) simply by a thermal-driven diffusion process. The confinement effect of nitrogen-doped carbon matrix is able to low the surface energy of bismuth nanoparticles against the easy aggregation commonly observed for the thermal treatment. On the basis of the synergistic effect and confinement effect between bismuth nanoparticles and carbon matrix, the highly dispersed active sites render the obviously improved electrocatalytic activity and stability for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction into formate. The in situ experimental observations on the reduction process and theoretical calculations reveal that the incorporation of bismuth nanoparticles with nitrogen-doped carbon matrix would promote the activation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the easy formation of key intermediate (*OCHO), thus leading the enhanced electrocatalytic activity, with a Faradaic Efficiency (FE) of formate about 94.8&#8201;% and the long-time stability. Furthermore, the coupling of an anode for 5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) in solar-driven system renders the high 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) yield of 81.2&#8201;%, presenting the impressive solar-to-fuel conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interlayer Structure Manipulation of FeOCl/MXene with Soft/Hard Interface Design for Safe Water Production Using Dechlorination Battery Deionization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The soft/hard interfaces assembly was designed by manipulating the interlayer structure, in which Ti3C2Tx dressed the fragile FeOCl with a soft and conductive suit, solving the thorny troubles of structural stability and electronic conductivity for FeOCl. The rigidity and flexibility integrated FeOCl/Ti3C2Tx worked for electrochemical dechlorination with simultaneous energy recovery, demonstrating the feasibility of dechlorination battery.







Abstract
Suffering from the susceptibility to decomposition, the potential electrochemical application of FeOCl has greatly been hindered. The rational design of the soft&#8208;hard material interface can effectively address the challenge of stress concentration and thus decomposition that may occur in the electrodes during charging and discharging. Herein, interlayer structure manipulation of FeOCl/MXene using soft&#8208;hard interface design method were conducted for electrochemical dechlorination. FeOCl was encapsulated in Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets by electrostatic self&#8208;assembly layer by layer to form a soft&#8208;hard mechanical hierarchical structure, in which Ti3C2Tx was used as flexible buffer layers to relieve the huge volume change of FeOCl during Cl&#8722; intercalation/deintercalation and constructed a conductive network for fast charge transfer. The CDI dechlorination system of FeOCl/Ti3C2Tx delivered outstanding Cl&#8722; adsorption capacity (158.47 &#177; 6.98&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1), rate (6.07 &#177; 0.35&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 min&#8722;1), and stability (over 94.49&#8201;% in 30 cycles), and achieved considerable energy recovery (21.14 &#177; 0.25&#8201;%). The superior dechlorination performance was proved to originate from the Fe2+/Fe3+ topochemical transformation and the deformation constraint effect of Ti3C2Tx on FeOCl. Our interfacial design strategy enables a hard&#8208;to&#8208;soft integration capacity, which can serve as a universal technology for solving the traditional problem of electrode volume expansion.

         <title>Merging High&#8208;Pressure Syngas Metal Catalysis and Biocatalysis in Tandem One&#8208;Pot Processes for the Synthesis of Nonchiral and Chiral Alcohols from Alkenes in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem one&#8208;pot process combining high&#8208;pressure hydroformylation of 1&#8208;octene and enzymatic reduction is demonstrated, leading to &gt;99&#8201;% conversion and 80&#8201;% yield of the isolated alcohol isomers. This concept was extended to the hydroformylation of styrene and enzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution, resulting in excellent conversion (&gt;99&#8201;%) and an enantiomeric ratio of 91&#8201;:&#8201;9 for (S)&#8208;2&#8208;phenylpropanol.







Abstract
While simultaneously proceeding reactions are among the most fascinating features of biosynthesis, this concept of tandem processes also offers high potential in the chemical industry in terms of less waste production and improved process efficiency and sustainability. Although examples of one&#8208;pot chemoenzymatic syntheses exist, the combination of completely different reaction types is rare. Herein, we demonstrate that extreme &#8220;antipodes&#8221; of the &#8220;worlds of catalysis&#8221;, such as syngas&#8208;based high&#8208;pressure hydroformylation and biocatalyzed reduction, can be combined within a tandem&#8208;type one&#8208;pot process in water. No significant deactivation was found for either the biocatalyst or the chemocatalyst. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for the one&#8208;pot process starting from 1&#8208;octene was established with &gt;99&#8201;% conversion and 80&#8201;% isolated yield of the desired alcohol isomers. All necessary components for hydroformylation and biocatalysis were added to the reactor from the beginning. This concept has been extended to the enantioselective synthesis of chiral products by conducting the hydroformylation of styrene and an enzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution in a tandem mode, leading to an excellent conversion of &gt;99&#8201;% and an enantiomeric ratio of 91&#8201;:&#8201;9 for (S)&#8208;2&#8208;phenylpropanol. The overall process runs in water under mild and energy&#8208;saving conditions, without any need for intermediate isolation.

         <title>Solvation Properties of Neutral Gold Species in Supercritical Water Studied By THz Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold clusters in aqueous supercritial solution are found to interact very strongly with the solvent, forming well&#8208;defined metal&#8208;water solvation complexes. Their THz spectrum is distinctly different from that of supercritical water, which can be exploited to probe such neutral metal species in hydrothermal fluids.







Abstract
Supercritical water provides distinctly different solvation properties compared to what is known from liquid water. Despite its prevalence deep in the Earth's crust and its role in chemosynthetic ecosystems in the vicinity of hydrothermal vents, molecular insights into its solvation mechanisms are still very scarce compared to what is known for liquid water. Recently, neutral metal particles have been detected in hydrothermal fluids and proposed to explain the transport of gold species to ore deposits on Earth. Using ab initio molecular dynamics, we elucidate the solvation properties of small gold species at supercritical conditions. The neutral metal clusters themselves contribute enormous THz intensity not because of their intramolecular vibrations, but due to their pronounced electronic polarization coupling to the dynamical supercritical solvent, leading to a continuum absorption up to about 1000&#8197;cm&#8722;1. On top, long&#8208;lived interactions between the gold clusters and solvation water leads at these supercritical conditions to a sharp THz resonance that happens to be close to the one due to H&#8208;bonding in liquid water at ambient conditions. The resulting distinct resonances can be used to analyse the solvation properties of neutral metal particles in supercritical aqueous solutions.

         <title>Identification of &#8220;Structural Pin&#8221; Interactions and their Significance for the Conformational Control of Macrocyclic Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we identify structural pins as intramolecular hydrogen bonds in macrocycles that are predominantly responsible for conformational stabilization. Characterization and structural analysis of macrocycles with NMR and molecular modelling indicates that removal of a structural pin drastically influences the conformation of the entire ring, resulting in novel states with increased conformational heterogeneity.







Abstract
While peptide macrocycles with rigidified conformations have proven to be useful in the design of chemical probes of protein targets, conformational flexibility and rapid interconversion can be equally vital for biological activity and favorable physicochemical properties. This study introduces the concept of &#8220;structural pin&#8221;, which describes a hydrogen bond that is largely responsible for stabilizing the entire macrocycle backbone conformation. Structural analysis of macrocycles using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), molecular modelling and X&#8208;ray diffraction indicates that disruption of the structural pin can drastically influence the conformation of the entire ring, resulting in novel states with increased flexibility. This finding provides a new tool to interrogate dynamic behaviour of macrocycles. Identification of structural pins offers a useful conceptual framework to understand positions that can either be modified to give flexible structures or retained to maintain the rigidity of the scaffold.

Structural analysis of macrocycles using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), molecular modelling and X-ray diffraction indicates that disruption of the structural pin can drastically influence the conformation of the entire ring, resulting in novel states with increased flexibility. This finding provides a new tool to interrogate dynamic behaviour of macrocycles. Identification of structural pins offers a useful conceptual framework to understand positions that can either be modified to give flexible structures or retained to maintain the rigidity of the scaffold.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Enhanced Photoreforming of Biomass Furans over a Urea&#8208;Incorporated Cu(II) Porphyrin Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A urea&#8208;incorporated porphyrin framework can activate molecular oxygen to generate selectively &#8901;O2&#8722; and 1O2 and enable the flat adsorption of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural in a low&#8208;energy configuration leveraging on hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, leading to highly efficient photo&#8208;oxidation that produces bioplastic monomers from renewable feedstocks without over&#8208;oxidation and photo&#8208;corrosion.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven upgrading of biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;hydroxylmethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) holds great promise for sustainable production of bio&#8208;plastics and resins. However, the process is limited by poor selectivity and sluggish kinetics due to the vertical coordination of HMF at relatively strong metal sites. Here, we purposely developed a Cu(II) porphyrin framework featuring side&#8208;chain incorporated urea linkages, denoted as TBUPP&#8722;Cu MOF, to render HMF a weak hydrogen bond at the urea site and flat adsorption via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking with the benzene moiety. The unique configuration promotes the approaching of &#8722;CHO of HMF to the photoexcited porphyrin ring towards kinetically and thermodynamically favourable intermediate formation and subsequent desorption. The charge localisation and orbital energy alignment enable the selective activation of O2 over the porphyrin to generate &#8901;O2&#8722; and 1O2 instead of highly oxidative H2O2 and &#8901;OH via spin&#8208;flip electron transfer, which drive the ambient oxidation of proximal &#8722;CHO. The effective utilisation of redox species and circumvented over&#8208;oxidation facilitate a FDCA selectivity of &gt;90&#8201;% with a high turnover number of 193&#8197;molHMF&#8201;molCu&#8722;1. The facile purification of high&#8208;purity FDCA and zero&#8208;waste recycling of intermediates and durable catalyst feature TBUPP&#8722;Cu MOF a promising photo&#8208;oxidation platform towards net&#8208;zero biorefining and organic transformations.

         <title>tert&#8208;Butyl as a Functional Group: Non&#8208;Directed Catalytic Hydroxylation of Sterically Congested Primary C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work pioneers site&#8208;selective non&#8208;directed hydroxylation of remote primary C&#8722;H bonds in tert&#8208;butyl groups employing hydrogen peroxide and the highly electrophilic Mn(CF3bpeb) catalyst in nonafluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl alcohol (NFTBA).







Abstract
The tert&#8208;butyl group is a common aliphatic motif extensively employed to implement steric congestion and conformational rigidity in organic and organometallic molecules. Because of the combination of a high bond dissociation energy (~100&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and limited accessibility, in the absence of directing groups, neither radical nor organometallic approaches are effective for the chemical modification of tert&#8208;butyl C&#8722;H bonds. Herein we overcome these limits by employing a highly electrophilic manganese catalyst, [Mn(CF3bpeb)(OTf)2], that operates in the strong hydrogen bond donor solvent nonafluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl alcohol (NFTBA) and catalytically activates hydrogen peroxide to generate a powerful manganese&#8208;oxo species that effectively oxidizes tert&#8208;butyl C&#8722;H bonds. Leveraging on the interplay of steric, electronic, medium and torsional effects, site&#8208;selective and product chemoselective hydroxylation of the tert&#8208;butyl group is accomplished with broad reaction scope, delivering primary alcohols as largely dominant products in preparative yields. Late&#8208;stage hydroxylation at tert&#8208;butyl sites is demonstrated on 6 densely functionalized molecules of pharmaceutical interest. This work uncovers a novel disconnection approach, harnessing tert&#8208;butyl as a potential functional group in strategic synthetic planning for complex molecular architectures.

         <title>Microwave Assisted Fast Synthesis of a Donor&#8208;Acceptor COF Towards Photooxidative Amidation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a microwave&#8208;assisted rapid synthesis (in time scale, t=10&#8197;seconds to 10&#8197;minutes) of a D&#8722;A based covalent organic framework, TzPm&#8208;COF towards photooxidative amidation reaction from aldehyde and amine. This photocatalytic approach works well with a variety of substituted aromatic aldehydes having electron&#8208;withdrawing or donating groups and cyclic, acyclic, primary or secondary amines with moderate to high yield.







Abstract
The synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) at bulk scale require robust, straightforward, and cost&#8208;effective techniques. However, the traditional solvothermal synthetic methods of COFs suffer low scalability as well as requirement of sensitive reaction environment and multiday reaction time (2&#8211;10&#8197;days) which greatly restricts their practical application. Here, we report microwave assisted rapid and optimized synthesis of a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) based highly crystalline COF, TzPm&#8208;COF in second (10&#8197;sec) to minute (10&#8197;min) time scale. With increasing the reaction time from seconds to minutes crystallinity, porosity and morphological changes are observed for TzPm&#8208;COF. Owing to visible range light absorption, suitable band alignment, and low exciton binding energy (Eb=64.6&#8197;meV), TzPm&#8208;COF can efficaciously produce superoxide radical anion (O2.&#8722;) after activating molecular oxygen (O2) which eventually drives aerobic photooxidative amidation reaction with high recyclability. This photocatalytic approach works well with a variety of substituted aromatic aldehydes having electron&#8208;withdrawing or donating groups and cyclic, acyclic, primary or secondary amines with moderate to high yield. Furthermore, catalytic mechanism was established by monitoring the real&#8208;time reaction progress through in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopic (DRIFTS) study.

         <title>New Alkalescent Electrolyte Chemistry for Zinc&#8208;Ferricyanide Flow Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new zinc&#8208;ferricyanide flow battery assembled with an alkalescent (pH=12) Zn&#8208;EDTA anolyte and Fe(CN)63&#8722;/Fe(CN)64&#8722; catholyte is constructed and has an energy density of ~74&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&#8722;1 at 60&#8201;&#176;C and remains stable for 1800&#8197;cycles (1800&#8197;hours) at 0&#8201;&#176;C and for &gt;1400&#8197;cycles (2300&#8197;hours) at 25&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Alkaline zinc&#8208;ferricyanide flow batteries are efficiency and economical as energy storage solutions. However, they suffer from low energy density and short calendar life. The strongly alkaline conditions (3&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 OH&#8722;) reduce the solubility of ferri/ferro&#8208;cyanide (normally only 0.4&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C) and induce the formation of zinc dendrites at the anode. Here, we report a new zinc&#8208;ferricyanide flow battery based on a mild alkalescent (pH&#8197;12) electrolyte. Using a chelating agent to rearrange ferri/ferro&#8208;cyanide ion&#8208;solvent interactions and improve salt dissociation, we increased the solubility of ferri/ferro&#8208;cyanide to 1.7&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 and prevented zinc dendrites. Our battery has an energy density of ~74&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&#8722;1catholyte at 60&#8201;&#176;C and remains stable for 1800&#8197;cycles (1800&#8197;hours) at 0&#8201;&#176;C and for &gt;1400&#8197;cycles (2300&#8197;hours) at 25&#8201;&#176;C. An alkalescent zinc&#8208;ferricyanide cell stack built using this alkalescent electrolyte stably delivers 608&#8197;W of power for ~40&#8197;days.

&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; catholyte is constructed and has an energy density of ~74&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 60&#8201;&#176;C and remains stable for 1800&#8197;cycles (1800&#8197;hours) at 0&#8201;&#176;C and for &amp;gt;1400&#8197;cycles (2300&#8197;hours) at 25&#8201;&#176;C.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alkaline zinc-ferricyanide flow batteries are efficiency and economical as energy storage solutions. However, they suffer from low energy density and short calendar life. The strongly alkaline conditions (3&#8197;mol&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) reduce the solubility of ferri/ferro-cyanide (normally only 0.4&#8197;mol&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 25&#8201;&#176;C) and induce the formation of zinc dendrites at the anode. Here, we report a new zinc-ferricyanide flow battery based on a mild alkalescent (pH&#8197;12) electrolyte. Using a chelating agent to rearrange ferri/ferro-cyanide ion-solvent interactions and improve salt dissociation, we increased the solubility of ferri/ferro-cyanide to 1.7&#8197;mol&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and prevented zinc dendrites. Our battery has an energy density of ~74&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;catholyte&lt;/sub&gt; at 60&#8201;&#176;C and remains stable for 1800&#8197;cycles (1800&#8197;hours) at 0&#8201;&#176;C and for &amp;gt;1400&#8197;cycles (2300&#8197;hours) at 25&#8201;&#176;C. An alkalescent zinc-ferricyanide cell stack built using this alkalescent electrolyte stably delivers 608&#8197;W of power for ~40&#8197;days.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Thermosalient and Mechanically Compliant Organic Crystalline Optical Waveguide Switcher</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic crystalline material exhibiting both plastic bending and thermosalient behavior with reversible crystal movement during phase transition is reported. The crystals transmit light regardless of their shape or crystalline phase. This unique combination enables switching of the material&#8216;s waveguiding ability within a narrow temperature range, promising applications in heat&#8208;sensitive electronics like central processing units. Being entirely organic, it offers reduced weight compared to the materials that are currently being used in electronics.







Abstract
The dense and ordered molecular arrangements endow dynamic molecular crystals with fast response, rapid energy conversion, low energy dissipation, and strong coupling between heat/light and mechanical energy. Most of the known dynamic crystals can only respond to a single stimulus, and materials that can respond to multiple stimuli are rare. Here, we report an organic crystalline material that can be bent plastically and is also thermosalient, as its crystals can move when they undergo a reversible phase transition. The crystals transmit light regardless of their shape or crystalline phase. The combination of light transduction and reversible thermomechanical deformation provides an opportunity to switch the waveguiding capability of the material in a narrow temperature range, which holds a tremendous potential for applications in heat&#8208;averse electronic components, such as central processing units. Unlike existing electronics, the material we report here is completely organic and therefore much lighter, potentially reducing the overall weight of electronic circuits.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;up Growth of Convex Sphere with Adjustable Cu(0)/Cu(I) Interfaces for Effective C2 Production from CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tightly&#8208;coupled adjustable Cu(0)/Cu(I) interface manufactured by a bottom&#8208;up growth strategy exhibits outstanding selectivity and stability of CO2RR. The convex sphere with the favorable Cu(0)/Cu(I) interface promotes the dimerization of localized *CO adsorbate, thus form the C2 products with a lowered energy barrier.







Abstract
One challenge confronting the Cu2O catalysts in the electrocatalysis of carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) is the reduction of active Cu(I) species, resulting in low selectivity and quick deactivation. In this study, we for the first time introduce a bottom&#8208;up growth of convex sphere with adjustable Cu(0)/Cu(I) interfaces (Cux@Cu2O convex spheres). Interestingly, the interfaces are dynamically modulated by varying hydrothermal time, thus regulating the conversion of C1 and C2 products. In particular, the 4&#8197;h hydrothermal treatment applied to Cu0.25@Cu2O convex sphere with the favorable Cu(0)/Cu(I) interface results in the highest selectivity for C2 products (90.5&#8201;%). In situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations reveal that the Cu(0)/Cu(I) interface lowers the energy barrier for the production of ethylene and ethanol while increasing the coverage of localized *CO adsorbate for increased dimerization. This work establishes a novel approach for transforming the state of valence&#8208;sensitive electrocatalysts into high&#8208;value energy&#8208;related engineering products.

         <title>Innovative Approach to Chiral Polyurethanes: Asymmetric Copolymerization with Isocyanates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we demonstrated the first example for the asymmetric copolymerization of various meso&#8208;epoxide with isocyanates toward the synthesis of chiral polymers with unique nitrogen functionality. Intramolecular bimetallic coordination strategies provided completely alternating copolymers with high carbamate unit content (up to 94&#8201;%) and high enantioselectivity (up to 94&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
The introduction of nitrogen&#8208;containing functional groups to chiral polymer backbones enables the tailoring of physical properties and offers opportunities for further post&#8208;polymerization modification. However, the substrate scope of such polymers is extremely limited because monomers having nitrogen&#8208;containing groups can change coordination state with respect to the metal centers, thus decreasing the activity and enantioselectivity and even poisoning the catalyst completely. In this paper, we report our attempts to carry out the asymmetric copolymerization of meso&#8208;epoxide with highly reactive isocyanates. In particular, we found that biphenol&#8208;linked bimetallic Co(III) complexes with multiple chiral centers are very efficient in catalyzing this asymmetric copolymerization reaction, affording optically active polyurethanes with a completely alternating nature and a high enantioselectivity of up to 94&#8201;% ee. Crucially, we identified that the steric hindrance at the phenolate ortho position of the ligand strongly influences the catalytic activity and product enantioselectivity. In addition, density functional theory calculations revealed that the highly sterically bulky substituents change the mechanism from bimetallic to monometallic, and result in the unexpected inversion of the chiral induction direction. Moreover, the high stereoregularity of the produced polyurethanes enhances their thermal stability, and they can be selectively decomposed into oxazolidinones. This study offers a versatile methodology for the synthesis of chiral polymers containing nitrogen functionalities.

         <title>Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging of Lipid Heterogeneity in the Inner Mitochondrial Membrane with a Super&#8208;photostable Environment&#8208;Sensitive Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly photostable and polarity&#8208;sensitive labeling agent for the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) has been developed, enabling visualization of mitochondrial cristae using STED microscopy. In combination with FLIM, it also allows the analysis of lipid heterogeneity at the single mitochondrion level. Time&#8208;lapse FLIM observations revealed that mitochondrial swelling is preceded by an increase in the IMM order resulting from lipid peroxidation.







Abstract
The inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) undergoes dynamic morphological changes, which are crucial for the maintenance of mitochondrial functions as well as cell survival. As the dynamics of the membrane are governed by its lipid components, a fluorescent probe that can sense spatiotemporal alterations in the lipid properties of the IMM over long periods of time is required to understand mitochondrial physiological functions in detail. Herein, we report a red&#8208;emissive IMM&#8208;labeling reagent with excellent photostability and sensitivity to its environment, which enables the visualization of the IMM ultrastructure using super&#8208;resolution microscopy as well as of the lipid heterogeneity based on the fluorescence lifetime at the single mitochondrion level. Combining the probe and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) showed that peroxidation of unsaturated lipids in the IMM by reactive oxygen species caused an increase in the membrane order, which took place prior to mitochondrial swelling.

Tuned fluorinated surface was proposed to achieve an ultra&#8208;thin and KF&#8208;enriched solid electrolyte interphase in potassium&#8208;ion battery. The tailored C&#8722;F configurations could induce local surface polarization to guide electrolyte decomposing orderly and prompt the enrichment of KF crystals in SEI by self&#8208;sacrifice dissociation. The electrode shows boosted rate performance and durable cycling performance under high loading of ~8.7&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) crucially affects the rate performance and cycling lifespan, yet to date more extensive research is still needed in potassium&#8208;ion batteries. We report an ultra&#8208;thin and KF&#8208;enriched SEI triggered by tuned fluorinated surface design in electrode. Our results reveal that fluorination engineering alters the interfacial chemical environment to facilitate inherited electronic conductivity, enhance adsorption ability of potassium, induce localized surface polarization to guide electrolyte decomposition behavior for SEI formation, and especially, enrich the KF crystals in SEI by self&#8208;sacrifice from C&#8722;F bond cleavage. Hence, the regulated fluorinated electrode with generated ultra&#8208;thin, uniform, and KF&#8208;enriched SEI shows improved capacity of 439.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (3.82&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2), boosted rate performance (202.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 8.70&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and durable cycling performance (even under high loading of ~8.7&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2). We expect this practical engineering principle to open up new opportunities for upgrading the development of potassium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Guiding Transient Peptide Assemblies with Structural Elements Embedded in Abiotic Phosphate Fuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We focus on fuel modifications to impact non&#8208;equilibrium systems, demonstrating how amino acid side chains within abiotic phosphates direct assembly and reactivity changes during structure formation. Through covalent binding to substrates, fuels drive the yield, the lifetime and the structural organization of transient species. Activated amino acids with varying reactivity and energy contents can pave the way for fabricating structured fuels.







Abstract
Despite great progress in the construction of non&#8208;equilibrium systems, most approaches do not consider the structure of the fuel as a critical element to control the processes. Herein, we show that the amino acid side chains (A, F, Nal) in the structure of abiotic phosphates can direct assembly and reactivity during transient structure formation. The fuels bind covalently to substrates and subsequently influence the structures in the assembly process. We focus on the ways in which the phosphate esters guide structure formation and how structures and reactivity cross regulate when constructing assemblies. Through the chemical functionalization of energy&#8208;rich aminoacyl phosphate esters, we are able to control the yield of esters and thioesters upon adding dipeptides containing tyrosine or cysteine residues. The structural elements around the phosphate esters guide the lifetime of the structures formed and their supramolecular assemblies. These properties can be further influenced by the peptide sequence of substrates, incorporating anionic, aliphatic and aromatic residues. Furthermore, we illustrate that oligomerization of esters can be initiated from a single aminoacyl phosphate ester incorporating a tyrosine residue (Y). These findings suggest that activated amino acids with varying reactivity and energy contents can pave the way for designing and fabricating structured fuels.

         <title>Formation of a Porous Crystalline Mg1&#8208;xAl2Oy Overlayer on Metal Catalysts via Controlled Solid&#8208;State Reactions for High&#8208;temperature Stable Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state reactions with limited Mg migration transform the amorphous Al2O3 overlayer on MgAl2O4&#8208;supported metal catalysts into a porous Mg1&#8208;xAl2Oy crystalline spinel structure with a pore size of 2&#8211;3&#8197;nm and weakened acidity, which allows achieving remarkably high stability while preserving high activity over Mg1&#8208;xAl2Oy&#8208;coated Ni/MgAl2O4 and Pt/MgAl2O4 catalysts in methane dry reforming and propane dehydrogenation reactions.







Abstract
Catalyst deactivation by sintering and coking is a long&#8208;standing issue in metal&#8208;catalyzed harsh high&#8208;temperature hydrocarbon reactions. Ultrathin oxide coatings of metal nanocatalysts have recently appeared attractive to address this issue, while the porosity of the overlayer is difficult to control to preserve the accessibility of embedded metal nanoparticles, thus often leading to a large decrease in activity. Here, we report that a nanometer&#8208;thick alumina coating of MgAl2O4&#8208;supported metal catalysts followed by high&#8208;temperature reduction can transform a nonporous amorphous alumina overlayer into a porous Mg1&#8208;xAl2Oy crystalline spinel structure with a pore size of 2&#8211;3&#8197;nm and weakened acidity. The high porosity stems from the restrained Mg migration from the MgAl2O4 support to the alumina overlayer through solid&#8208;state reactions at high temperatures. The resulting Ni/MgAl2O4 and Pt/MgAl2O4 catalysts with a porous crystalline Mg1&#8208;xAl2Oy overlayer achieved remarkably high stability while preserving much higher activity than the corresponding alumina&#8208;coated Ni and Pt catalysts on MgO and Al2O3 supports in the reactions of dry reforming of methane and propane dehydrogenation, respectively.

         <title>A Stretchable and Tough Graphene Film Enabled by Mechanical Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A [2]rotaxane&#8208;bridged graphene (RBG) film was fabricated, in which graphene nanosheets were cross&#8208;linked by mechanical bonds. During the stretching process, the intramolecular motion of [2]rotaxanes resulted in the release of hidden chains, so that the mechanical properties of RBG films were improved, realizing the effect of strengthening and toughening graphene films.







Abstract
The pursuit of fabricating high&#8208;performance graphene films has aroused considerable attention due to their potential for practical applications. However, developing both stretchable and tough graphene films remains a formidable challenge. To address this issue, we herein introduce mechanical bond to comprehensively improve the mechanical properties of graphene films, utilizing [2]rotaxane as the bridging unit. Under external force, the [2]rotaxane cross&#8208;link undergoes intramolecular motion, releasing hidden chain and increasing the interlayer slip distance between graphene nanosheets. Compared with graphene films without [2]rotaxane cross&#8208;linking, the presence of mechanical bond not only boosted the strength of graphene films (247.3 vs 74.8&#8197;MPa) but also markedly promoted the tensile strain (23.6 vs 10.2&#8201;%) and toughness (23.9 vs 4.0&#8197;MJ/m3). Notably, the achieved tensile strain sets a record high and the toughness surpasses most reported results, rendering the graphene films suitable for applications as flexible electrodes. Even when the films were stretched within a 20&#8201;% strain and repeatedly bent vertically, the light&#8208;emitting diodes maintained an on&#8208;state with little changes in brightness. Additionally, the film electrodes effectively actuated mechanical joints, enabling uninterrupted grasping movements. Therefore, the study holds promise for expanding the application of graphene films and simultaneously inspiring the development of other high&#8208;performance two&#8208;dimensional films.

Timely detection of early&#8208;stage cancer presents a tremendous opportunity to enhance prognostic outcomes, and there is an increasing desire for sensitive and cost&#8208;effective cancer detection tools. We present a liposome nanosensor for sensitive urinalysis&#8208;based cancer monitoring by using sucrose to convert tumor&#8208;specific esterase activity into a glucose meter&#8208;compatible readout. Such a non&#8208;invasive diagnostic platform assists in the personalized assessment of pharmacological efficacy.







Abstract
Timely detection of early&#8208;stage cancer holds immense potential in enhancing prognostic outcomes. There is an increasing desire for versatile tools to enable simple, sensitive, and cost&#8208;effective cancer detection. By exploiting the extraintestinal metabolic inertness and efficiency renal clearance of sucrose, we designed a liposome nanosensor using sucrose as a messenger to convert tumor&#8208;specific esterase activity into glucose meter readout, enabling economical and sensitive urinalysis for cancer detection in point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT). Our results demonstrate that the nanosensors exhibited significant signal differences between tumor&#8208;bearing and healthy mice in both orthotopic and metastatic tumor models. Additionally, efficient elimination of the nanosensors through the hepatobiliary pathway was observed with no significant toxicity. Such a non&#8208;invasive diagnostic modality significantly assists in personalized pharmacological treatment and follow&#8208;up efficacy assessment. We envision that this modular liposome nanosensor platform might be applied for economically detecting diverse diseases via a simple urinary test.

         <title>Chiral Ligand&#8208;Concentration Mediating Asymmetric Transformations of Silver Nanoclusters: NIR&#8208;II Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence Lighting</title>

Chiral ligand&#8208;concentration mediating asymmetric transformations of silver nanoclusters realize visible and second near&#8208;infrared circularly polarized phosphorescences.







Abstract
Near infrared (NIR) emitter with circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP), known as NIR CPP, has emerged as a key part in the research of cutting&#8208;edge luminescent materials. However, it remains a challenge to obtain nanoclusters with NIR CPP activity. Here, we propose an asymmetric transformation approach to efficiently synthesize two pairs of chiral silver nanoclusters (R/S&#8208;Ag29 and R/S&#8208;Ag16) using an achiral Ag10 nanocluster as starting material in the presence of different concentration chiral inducer (R/S)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diyl hydrogenphosphate (R/S&#8208;BNP). R/S&#8208;Ag29, formed in the low&#8208;concentration R/S&#8208;BNP, exhibits a unique kernel&#8208;shell structure consisting of a distorted Ag13 icosahedron and an integrated cage&#8208;like organometallic shell with a C3 symmetry, and possesses a superatomic 6&#8208;electron configuration (1S2|1P4). By contrast, R/S&#8208;Ag16, formed in the high&#8208;concentration R/S&#8208;BNP, features a sandwich&#8208;like pentagram with AgI&#8208;pure kernel. Profiting from the hierarchically chiral structures and superatomic kernel&#8208;dominated phosphorescence, R/S&#8208;Ag29 exhibits infrequent CPP activity in the second near&#8208;infrared (975&#8197;nm) region, being the first instance of NIR&#8208;II CPP observed among CPL&#8208;active metal nanoclusters. This study presents a new approach to reduce the difficulty of de novo synthesis for chiral silver nanomaterials, and facilitates the design of CPP&#8208;active superatomic nanoclusters in NIR region.

         <title>Assembly of Glycopeptides in Living Cells Resembling Viral Infection for Cargo Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A glycosylated peptide is designed to formulate SgVEIP that exhibits cancer cell targeting and enzyme&#8208;responsive properties arising from the galactose&#8208;galectin&#8208;1 association and galactosidase&#8208;induced hydrolysis. Precursor SgVEIP undergoes an in situ cascade targeting&#8208;hydrolysis&#8208;transformation assembly resembling to viral infection in a holistic manner, thus allowing for efficient delivery of irinotecan and peptide drugs to kill cancer cells.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly in living cells represents one versatile strategy for drug delivery; however, it suffers from the limited precision and efficiency. Inspired by viral traits, we here report a cascade targeting&#8208;hydrolysis&#8208;transformation (THT) assembly of glycosylated peptides in living cells holistically resembling viral infection for efficient cargo delivery and combined tumor therapy. We design a glycosylated peptide via incorporating a &#946;&#8208;galactose&#8208;serine residue into bola&#8208;amphiphilic sequences. Co&#8208;assembling of the glycosylated peptide with two counterparts containing irinotecan (IRI) or ligand TSFAEYWNLLSP (PMI) results in formation of the glycosylated co&#8208;assemblies SgVEIP, which target cancer cells via &#946;&#8208;galactose&#8208;galectin&#8208;1 association and undergo galactosidase&#8208;induced morphological transformation. While GSH&#8208;reduction causes release of IRI from the co&#8208;assemblies, the PMI moieties release p53 and facilitate cell death via binding with protein MDM2. Cellular experiments show membrane targeting, endo&#8208;/lysosome&#8208;mediated internalization and in situ formation of nanofibers in cytoplasm by SgVEIP. This cascade THT process enables efficient delivery of IRI and PMI into cancer cells secreting Gal&#8208;1 and overexpressing &#946;&#8208;galactosidase. In vivo studies illustrate enhanced tumor accumulation and retention of the glycosylated co&#8208;assemblies, thereby suppressing tumor growth. Our findings demonstrate an in situ assembly strategy mimicking viral infection, thus providing a new route for drug delivery and cancer therapy in the future.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Low&#8208;Potential Methanol Oxidation on Single&#8208;Ir&#8208;Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under the coupling of thermocatalysis and electrocatalysis, methanol was first thermally catalyzed to decompose to CO and H2 under the voltage promotion, then the generated CO and H2 was electrochemically oxidized to CO2 and proton at ultra&#8208;low onset potential (&lt;0.1&#8197;V) over the the electron&#8208;deficient IrC4 sites, which strongly adsorb the methanol to break H&#8722;O/H&#8722;C.







Abstract
Methanol oxidation plays a central role to implement sustainable energy economy, which is restricted by the sluggish reaction kinetics due to the multi&#8208;electron transfer process accompanied by numerous sequential intermediate. In this study, an efficient cascade methanol oxidation reaction is catalyzed by single&#8208;Ir&#8208;atom catalyst at ultra&#8208;low potential (&lt;0.1&#8197;V) with the promotion of the thermal and electrochemical integration in a high temperature polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzer. At the elevated temperature, the electron deficient Ir site with higher methanol affinity could spontaneous catalyze the CH3OH dehydrogenation to CO under the voltage, then the generated CO and H2 was electrochemically oxidized to CO2 and proton. However, the methanol cannot thermally decompose with the voltage absence, which confirm the indispensable of the coupling of thermal and electrochemical integration for the methanol oxidation. By assembling the methanol oxidation reaction with hydrogen evolution reaction with single&#8208;Ir&#8208;atom catalysts in the anode chamber, a max hydrogen production rate reaches 18&#8197;mol&#8201;gIr&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is much greater than that of Ir nanoparticles and commercial Pt/C. This study also demonstrated the electrochemical methanol oxidation activity of the single atom catalysts, which broadens the renewable energy devices and the catalyst design by an integration concept.

Developing low&#8208;cost, highly active, stable, and CO resistant alkaline HOR electrocatalysts are crucial for achieving the application of AEMFCs. (RuCo)NC+SAs/N&#8208;CNT with and dilute RuCo alloy nanoparticles and highly dispersed Ru and Co single atoms can achieve efficient alkaline HOR, with superior stability and outstanding CO resistance. When used (RuCo)NC+SAs/N&#8208;CNT to AEMFC anode catalyst, AEMFCs can achieve high peak power density with low noble metal loading (1.98&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a load of 0.1&#8197;mgRu&#8201;cm&#8722;2).







Abstract
Ruthenium (Ru) is considered a promising candidate catalyst for alkaline hydroxide oxidation reaction (HOR) due to its hydrogen binding energy (HBE) like that of platinum (Pt) and its much higher oxygenophilicity than that of Pt. However, Ru still suffers from insufficient intrinsic activity and CO resistance, which hinders its widespread use in anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs). Here, we report a hybrid catalyst (RuCo)NC+SAs/N&#8208;CNT consisting of dilute RuCo alloy nanoparticles and atomically single Ru and Co atoms on N&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes The catalyst exhibits a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art activity with a high mass activity of 7.35&#8197;A&#8201;mgRu&#8722;1. More importantly, when (RuCo)NC+SAs/N&#8208;CNT is used as an anode catalyst for AEMFCs, its peak power density reaches 1.98&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is one of the best AEMFCs properties of noble metal&#8208;based catalysts at present. Moreover, (RuCo)NC+SAs/N&#8208;CNT has superior long&#8208;time stability and CO resistance. The experimental and density functional theory (DFT) results demonstrate that the dilute alloying and monodecentralization of the exotic element Co greatly modulates the electronic structure of the host element Ru, thus optimizing the adsorption of H and OH and promoting the oxidation of CO on the catalyst surface, and then stimulates alkaline HOR activity and CO tolerance of the catalyst.

         <title>Autophagy&#8208;Inducing MoO3&#8208;x Nanowires Boost Photothermal&#8208;Triggered Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MoO3&#8208;x nanowires with high oxygen vacancy acts as a photothermal agent in combination with photothermal therapy to ablate tumors through hyperthermia, thus induces pro&#8208;death function of autophagy, and increases the release of tumor&#8208;associated antigens to act as an effective specific immunostimulant, finally promotes immunogenic cell death in tumor therapy.







Abstract
Autophagy could play suppressing role in cancer therapy by facilitating release of tumor antigens from dying cells and inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD). Therefore, discovery and rational design of more effective inducers of cytotoxic autophagy is expected to develop new strategies for finding innovative drugs for precise and successful cancer treatment. Herein, we develop MoO3&#8208;x nanowires (MoO3&#8208;x NWs) with high oxygen vacancy and strong photothermal responsivity to ablate tumors through hyperthermia, thus promote the induction of cytotoxic autophagy and severe ICD. As expected, the combination of MoO3&#8208;x NWs and photothermal therapy (PTT) effectively induces autophagy to promote the release of tumor antigens from the ablated cells, and induces the maturation and antigen presentation of dendritic cells (DCs), subsequently activates cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)&#8208;mediated adaptive immunity. Furthermore, the combination treatment of MoO3&#8208;x NWs with immune checkpoint blockade of PD&#8208;1 could promote the tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) polarization into tumor&#8208;killing M1 macrophages, inhibit infiltration of Treg cells at tumor sites, and alleviate immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment, finally intensify the anti&#8208;tumor activity in vivo. This study provides a strategy and preliminary elucidation of the mechanism of using MoO3&#8208;x nanowires with high oxygen vacancy to induce autophagy and thus enhance photothermal immunotherapy.

         <title>Crystalline Porous Organic Frameworks Based on Multiple Dynamic Linkages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of crystalline porous organic frameworks (CPOFs) are prepared based on covalent B&#8722;O, dative B&#8592;N and hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, gram&#8208;scale production can be achieved at low cost, alongside excellent solution processibility, paving the way to diverse applications. Remarkably, the CPOFs exhibit exceptionally high NH3 uptake capacities, indicating their great potential toward NH3 capture.







Abstract
A novel class of crystalline porous materials has been developed utilizing multilevel dynamic linkages, including covalent B&#8722;O, dative B&#8592;N and hydrogen bonds. Typically, boronic acids undergo in situ condensation to afford B3O3&#8208;based units, which further extend to molecular complexes or chains via B&#8592;N bonds. The obtained superstructures are subsequently interconnected via hydrogen bonds and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, producing crystalline porous organic frameworks (CPOFs). The CPOFs display excellent solution processability, allowing dissolution and subsequent crystallization to their original structures, independent of recrystallization conditions, possibly due to the diverse bond energies of the involved interactions. Significantly, the CPOFs can be synthesized on a gram&#8208;scale using cost&#8208;effective monomers. In addition, the numerous acidic sites endow the CPOFs with high NH3 capacity, surpassing most porous organic materials and commercial materials.

         <title>On the Dendrite&#8208;Suppressing Effect of Laser&#8208;Processed Polylactic Acid&#8208;Derived Carbon Coated Zinc Anode in Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bare Zn metal when used as anode in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs), is prone to dendrite formation and parasitic side reactions due to uneven Zn deposition on its surface. A porous carbon layer derived from the laser&#8208;assisted carbonization of bio&#8208;derived polylactic acid (PLA) on Zn metal effectively mitigates the formation of dendrites and parasitic side reactions on the Zn anode, thereby enhancing the stability and lifespan of the battery.







Abstract
A major bottleneck limiting the commercialization of aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) is dendrite formation on the zinc (Zn) anode during the plating/stripping process, which leads to rapid deterioration in performance and, consequently to the device failure. In this regard, researchers are trying to design more stable anodes toward suppressing dendrite formation. One possible solution to tackle this problem and to extend the cycling life of AZIBs is to modify the zinc anode surface by coating carbonaceous materials, enabling more controlled charge flux and uniform ion distribution. This work reports sustainable and bio&#8208;derived polylactic acid (PLA) as a coating layer on the zinc anode. Carbonizing this polymer under ambient conditions using a high&#8208;power nanosecond laser forms a carbon&#8208;coated zinc foil, which was directly utilized as the anode in aqueous zinc ion batteries. The fabricated laser&#8208;processed PLA&#8208;derived carbon&#8208;coated zinc anode demonstrated an extended cycling life of almost 1600&#8197;hours, significantly outperforming the bare zinc anode. A full aqueous zinc ion battery assembled from as&#8208;modified anode and as&#8208;prepared V2O5 nanofibers as cathode was able to deliver a specific capacity of 238&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention of 70&#8201;% after 1000 cycles.

         <title>Silylenes with a Small Chalcogenide Substituent: Tuning Frontier Orbital Energies from O to Te</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acyclic dicoordinated silylenes with small chalcogenide substituents were prepared and characterised, enabled by a bulky carbazolyl scaffold. The electronic properties change dramatically from O to Te, with decreasing HOMO&#8211;LUMO gaps and increasing chemical shift of the 29Si NMR resonances.







Abstract
The general synthesis of heteroleptic acyclic silylenes with a bulky carbazolyl substituent (dtbpCbz) is detailed and a series of compounds with a chalcogenide substituent of the type [(dtbpCbz)SiE16R] (E16R=OtBu, SEt, SePh, TePh) is reported. With the bulky carbazolyl substituent present, the chalcogenide moiety can be very small, as is shown by incorporating groups as small as ethyl, phenyl or tert&#8208;butyl. For the first time, the electronic properties of the silylene can be tuned along a complete series of chalcogenide substituents. The effects are clearly visible in the NMR and UV/Vis spectra, and were rationalised by DFT computations.

     alt="Silylenes with a Small Chalcogenide Substituent: Tuning Frontier Orbital Energies from O to Te"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acyclic dicoordinated silylenes with small chalcogenide substituents were prepared and characterised, enabled by a bulky carbazolyl scaffold. The electronic properties change dramatically from O to Te, with decreasing HOMO&#8211;LUMO gaps and increasing chemical shift of the &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;Si NMR resonances.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general synthesis of heteroleptic acyclic silylenes with a bulky carbazolyl substituent (&lt;sup&gt;dtbp&lt;/sup&gt;Cbz) is detailed and a series of compounds with a chalcogenide substituent of the type [(&lt;sup&gt;dtbp&lt;/sup&gt;Cbz)SiE&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;R] (E&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;R=O&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Bu, SEt, SePh, TePh) is reported. With the bulky carbazolyl substituent present, the chalcogenide moiety can be very small, as is shown by incorporating groups as small as ethyl, phenyl or &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl. For the first time, the electronic properties of the silylene can be tuned along a complete series of chalcogenide substituents. The effects are clearly visible in the NMR and UV/Vis spectra, and were rationalised by DFT computations. The reactivity of the heaviest chalcogenide-substituted silylenes was probed by reactions with trimethylphosphine selenide and the terphenyl azide TerN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (Ter=2,6-dimesitylphenyl).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Coordination Regulating D&#8208;Orbital Spin&#8208;Electron Filling in Single&#8208;Atom Iron Catalyst for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enhance the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C electrocatalyst, we implemented an asymmetric coordination within the first coordination shell of Fe site. The creation of the Fe&#8722;N3O configuration, characterized by asymmetrical oxygen coordination and adjacent defect, caused electrons in d orbitals from low&#8208;spin state to a medium&#8208;spin state. This optimization effectively weakened the adsorption of oxygen species and altered the potential&#8208;determining step.







Abstract
The single&#8208;atom Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst has shown great promise for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), yet the intrinsic activity is not satisfactory. There is a pressing need to gain a deeper understanding of the charge configuration of the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst and to develop rational modulation strategies. Herein, we have prepared a single&#8208;atom Fe catalyst with the co&#8208;coordination of N and O (denoted as Fe&#8722;N/O&#8722;C) and adjacent defect, proposing a strategy to optimize the d&#8208;orbital spin&#8208;electron filling of Fe sites by fine&#8208;tuning the first coordination shell. The Fe&#8722;N/O&#8722;C exhibits significantly better ORR activity compared to its Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C counterpart and commercial Pt/C, with a much more positive half&#8208;wave potential (0.927&#8197;V) and higher kinetic current density. Moreover, using the Fe&#8722;N/O&#8722;C catalyst, the Zn&#8208;air battery and proton exchange membrane fuel cell achieve peak power densities of up to 490 and 1179&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. Theoretical studies and in situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy reveal that Fe&#8722;N/O&#8722;C undergoes charge redistribution and negative shifting of the d&#8208;band center compared to Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C, thus optimizing the adsorption free energy of ORR intermediates. This work demonstrates the feasibility of introducing an asymmetric first coordination shell for single&#8208;atom catalysts and provides a new optimization direction for their practical application.

         <title>Rapid Defect Engineering in FeCoNi/FeAl2O4 Hybrid for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Catalysis: A Pathway to High&#8208;Performance Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the defect engineering, ultrasonic cavitation was utilized to rapidly introduce different types of defects into a FeCoNi/FeAl2O4 coating to increase edge unsaturated active sites. Simultaneously, different defects synergistically enhance the oxygenophilicity character, allowing the coating to activate the surface reconstruction into highly active catalytic species at low potential.







Abstract
Rational modulation of surface reconstruction in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) utilizing defect engineering to form efficient catalytic activity centers is a topical interest in the field of catalysis. The introduction of point defects has been demonstrated to be an effective strategy to regulate the electronic configuration of electrocatalysts, but the influence of more complex planar defects (e.g., twins and stacking faults), on their intrinsic activity is still not fully understood. This study harnesses ultrasonic cavitation for rapid and controlled introduction of different types of defects in the FeCoNi/FeAl2O4 hybrid coating, optimizing OER catalytic activity. Theoretical calculations and experiments demonstrate that the different defects optimize the coordination environment and facilitate the activation of surface reconstruction into true catalytic activity centers at lower potentials. Moreover, it demonstrates exceptional durability, maintaining stable oxygen production at a high current density of 300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for over 120&#8197;hours. This work not only presents a novel pathway for designing advanced electrocatalysts but also deepens our understanding of defect&#8208;engineered catalytic mechanisms, showcasing the potential for rapid and efficient enhancement of electrocatalytic performance.

         <title>Tunable Interfacial Electric Field&#8208;Mediated Cobalt&#8208;Doped FeSe/Fe3Se4 Heterostructure for High&#8208;Efficiency Potassium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An undifferentiated cobalt&#8208;doped FeSe/Fe3Se4 (UN&#8208;CoFe4Se5) heterostructure with optimized interfacial electric field (IEF) is designed and fabricated for high&#8208;efficiency potassium&#8208;ion battery (PIB) anodes. The IEF intensity in UN&#8208;CoFe4Se5 is 3.65&#8197;times that of pure FeSe/Fe3Se4. Intriguingly, this uniform doping strategy has strong generality in improving IEF strength and PIB performance. As expected, amorphous carbon&#8208;coated UN&#8208;CoFe4Se5 exhibits superior rate capability (145.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and long cycle life (95.1&#8201;% capacity retention after 3000 cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1).







Abstract
The interfacial electric field (IEF) in the heterostructure can accelerate electron transport and ion migration, thereby enhancing the electrochemical performance of potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs). Nevertheless, the quantification and modulation of the IEF for high&#8208;efficiency PIB anodes currently remains a blank slate. Herein, we achieve for the first time the quantification and tuning of IEF via amorphous carbon&#8208;coated undifferentiated cobalt&#8208;doped FeSe/Fe3Se4 heterostructure (denoted UN&#8208;CoFe4Se5/C) for efficient potassium storage. Co doping can increase the IEF in FeSe/Fe3Se4, thereby improving the electron transport, promoting the potassium adsorption capacity, and lowering the diffusion barrier. As expected, the IEF magnitude in UN&#8208;CoFe4Se5/C is experimentally quantified as 62.84&#8197;mV, which is 3.65&#8197;times larger than that of amorphous carbon&#8208;coated FeSe/Fe3Se4 heterostructure (Fe4Se5/C). Benefiting from the strong IEF, UN&#8208;CoFe4Se5/C as a PIB anode exhibits superior rate capability (145.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and long cycle lifespan (capacity retention of 95.1&#8201;% over 3000 cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). Furthermore, this undifferentiated doping strategy can universally regulate the IEF magnitude in CoSe2/Co9Se8 and FeS2/Fe7S8 heterostructures. This work can provide fundamental insights into the design of advanced PIB electrodes.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Mediated Photochemical C&#8722;H Arylation of Pyrroles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An octahedrally coordinated bis(diiminopyridine)cobalt complex enables the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven arylation of pyrroles with chloro&#8208; and bromoarenes. Spectroscopic and computational studies elucidate the photoelectron transfer processes of the metal complex with triethylamine and a bromoarene, suggesting that electron transfer is facilitated by a preassembly of these molecules with the complex.







Abstract
Precious metal complexes remain ubiquitous in photoredox catalysis (PRC) despite concerted efforts to find more earth&#8208;abundant catalysts and replacements based on 3d metals in particular. Most otherwise plausible 3d metal complexes are assumed to be unsuitable due to short&#8208;lived excited states, which has led researchers to prioritize the pursuit of longer excited&#8208;state lifetimes through careful molecular design. However, we report herein that the C&#8722;H arylation of pyrroles and related substrates (which are benchmark reactions for assessing the efficacy of photoredox catalysts) can be achieved using a simple and readily accessible octahedral bis(diiminopyridine) cobalt complex, [1&#8208;Co](PF6)2. Notably, [1&#8208;Co]2+ efficiently functionalizes both chloro&#8208; and bromoarene substrates despite the short excited&#8208;state lifetime of the key photoexcited intermediate *[1&#8208;Co]2+ (8&#8197;ps). We present herein the scope of this C&#8722;H arylation protocol and provide mechanistic insights derived from detailed spectroscopic and computational studies. These indicate that, despite its transient existence, reduction of *[1&#8208;Co]2+ is facilitated via pre&#8208;assembly with the NEt3 reductant, highlighting an alternative strategy for the future development of 3d metal&#8208;catalyzed PRC.

         <title>Grain&#8208;Boundary&#8208;Rich RuO2 Porous Nanosheet for Efficient and Stable Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin porous RuO2 nanosheet with abundant of grain boundaries (GB&#8208;RuO2) was synthesized as an efficient acid OER catalyst. Grain boundaries effectively regulated the electronic structure of the active site and optimized the adsorption behavior of intermediates, but also stabilized the active site structure by preventing Ru dissolution and converting the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) to the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM).







Abstract
RuO2 has been considered as the most likely acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst to replace IrO2, but its performance, especially long&#8208;term stability under harsh acidic conditions, is still unacceptable. Here, we propose a grain boundary (GB) engineering strategy by fabricating the ultrathin porous RuO2 nanosheet with abundant of grain boundaries (GB&#8208;RuO2) as an efficient acid OER catalyst. The involvement of GB induces significant tensile stress and creates an unsaturated coordination environment, effectively optimizing the adsorption of intermediates and stabilizing active site structure during OER process. Notably, the GB&#8208;RuO2 not only exhibits a low overpotential (&#951;10=187&#8197;mV) with an ultra&#8208;low Tafel slope (34.5&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1), but also steadily operates for over 550&#8197;h in 0.1&#8197;M HClO4. Quasi in situ/operando methods confirm that the improved stability is attributed to GB preventing Ru dissolution and greatly inhibiting the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM). A proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) using the GB&#8208;RuO2 catalyst operates a low voltage of 1.669&#8197;V at 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and operates stably for 100&#8197;h at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Template&#8208;Guided Silicon Micromotor Assembly for Enhanced Cell Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optomagnetic hybrid micromotor was developed using an optimized silicon&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Insulator&#8208;Semiconductor (MIS) solar cell. The micromotor displays diverse motion modes influenced by fracture surfaces and interactions with the environment. Additionally, an innovative hole&#8208;assisted assembly strategy is introduced, facilitating assembly into functional microrobots and enabling precise cell manipulation.







Abstract
Light&#8208;driven micro/nanorobots (LMNRs) are tiny, untethered machines with great potential in fields like precision medicine, nano manufacturing, and various other domains. However, their practicality hinges on developing light&#8208;manipulation strategies that combine versatile functionalities, flexible design options, and precise controllability. Our study introduces an innovative approach to construct micro/nanorobots (MNRs) by utilizing micro/nanomotors as fundamental building blocks. Inspired by silicon Metal&#8208;Insulator&#8208;Semiconductor (MIS) solar cell principles, we design a new type of optomagnetic hybrid micromotors (OHMs). These OHMs have been skillfully optimized with integrated magnetic constituent, resulting in efficient light propulsion, precise magnetic navigation, and the potential for controlled assembly. One of the key features of the OHMs is their ability to exhibit diverse motion modes influenced by fracture surfaces and interactions with the environment, streamlining cargo conveyance along &#8220;micro expressway&#8221;&#8212;the predesigned microchannels. Further enhancing their versatility, a template&#8208;guided assembly strategy facilitates the assembly of these micromotors into functional microrobots, encompassing various configurations such as &#8220;V&#8208;shaped&#8221;, &#8220;N&#8208;shaped&#8221;, and 3D structured microrobots. The heightened capabilities of these microrobots, underscore the innovative potential inherent in hybrid micromotor design and assembly, which provides a foundational platform for the realization of multi&#8208;component microrobots. Our work moves a step toward forthcoming microrobotic entities boasting advanced functionalities.

         <title>Single&#8208;cluster Functionalized TiO2 Nanotube Array for Boosting Water Oxidation and CO2 Photoreduction to CH3OH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile electrosynthesis strategy was developed to achieve single dispersion of various POMs on TiO2 nanotube array. The POMs can serve as electronic sponge to store multi&#8208;electrons thus greatly improving the surface hole concentration to promote water oxidation. The left electron on P2Mo18@TiO2 can effeiciently drive CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH3OH conversion with much enhanced performance compared to that of pristine TiO2 nanoarray.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction and water oxidation to liquid fuels represents a promising solution to alleviate energy crisis and climate issue, but it remains a great challenge for generating CH3OH and CH3CH2OH dominated by multi&#8208;electron transfer. Single&#8208;cluster catalysts with super electron acceptance, accurate molecular structure, customizable electronic structure and multiple adsorption sites, have led to greater potential in catalyzing various challenging reactions. However, accurately controlling the number and arrangement of clusters on functional supports still faces great challenge. Herein, we develop a facile electrosynthesis method to uniformly disperse Wells&#8208;Dawson&#8208; and Keggin&#8208;type polyoxometalates on TiO2 nanotube arrays, resulting in a series of single&#8208;cluster functionalized catalysts P2M18O62@TiO2 and PM12O40@TiO2 (M=Mo or W). The single polyoxometalate cluster can be distinctly identified and serves as electronic sponge to accept electrons from excited TiO2 for enhancing surface&#8208;hole concentration and promote water oxidation. Among these samples, P2Mo18O62@TiO2&#8208;1 exhibits the highest electron consumption rate of 1260&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH3OH conversion with H2O as the electron source, which is 11&#8197;times higher than that of isolated TiO2 nanotube arrays. This work supplied a simple synthesis method to realize the single&#8208;dispersion of molecular cluster to enrich surface&#8208;reaching holes on TiO2, thereby facilitating water oxidation and CO2 reduction.

         <title>Hyperbranched Vitrimer for Ultrahigh Energy Dissipation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymers have been utilized as damping materials due to the high internal friction of molecular chains, enabling effectively dissipate energy as heat during service. Our work firstly presents hyperbranched vitrimers (HBVs) containing dense pendant chains and loose dynamic crosslinked networks, which exhibit ultrahigh energy&#8208;dissipation performance over a broad frequency range of nearly 10 orders of magnitude. This innovative design concept will provide opportunities for the further development of damping materials with multiple synergistic effects.







Abstract
Polymers are ideally utilized as damping materials due to the high internal friction of molecular chains, enabling effective suppression of vibrations and noises in various fields. Current strategies rely on broadening the glass transition region or introducing additional relaxation components to enhance the energy dissipation capacity of polymeric damping materials. However, it remains a significant challenge to achieve high damping efficiency through structural control while maintaining dynamic characteristics. In this work, we propose a new strategy to develop hyperbranched vitrimers (HBVs) containing dense pendant chains and loose dynamic crosslinked networks. A novel yet weak dynamic transesterification between the carboxyl and boronic acid ester was confirmed and used to prepare HBVs based on poly (hexyl methacrylate&#8208;2&#8208;(4&#8208;ethenylphenyl)&#8208;5,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;dioxaborinane) P(HMA&#8208;co&#8208;ViCL) copolymers. The

 ${{AB}_{n}}$



&#8208;type of macromonomers, the crosslinking points formed by the dynamic covalent connection via the associative exchange, and the weak yet dynamic exchange reaction are the three keys to developing high&#8208;performance HBV damping materials. We found that P(HMA&#8208;co&#8208;ViCL) 20k&#8208;40&#8208;60&#8197;HBV exhibited ultrahigh energy&#8208;dissipation performance over a broad frequency and temperature range, attributed to the synergistic effect of dense pendant chains and weak dynamic covalent crosslinks. This unique design concept will provide a general approach to developing advanced damping materials.

         <title>Enrooted&#8208;Type Metal&#8208;Support Interaction Boosting Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supported metal catalyst with new enrooted&#8208;type metal&#8208;support interaction, where the Ir clusters atomically enrooted into the lattice of WO3 support, has been synthesized through a facile approach, achieving a stable metal&#8208;support interface and maximized exposure of metal active sites.







Abstract
Supported metal catalysts with appropriate metal&#8208;support interactions (MSIs) hold a great promise for heterogeneous catalysis. However, ensuring tight immobilization of metal clusters/nanoparticles on the support while maximizing the exposure of surface active sites remains a huge challenge. Herein, we report an Ir/WO3 catalyst with a new enrooted&#8208;type MSI in which Ir clusters are, unprecedentedly, atomically enrooted into the WO3 lattice. The enrooted Ir atoms decrease the electron density of the constructed interface compared to the adhered (root&#8208;free) type, thereby achieving appropriate adsorption toward oxygen intermediates, ultimately leading to high activity and stability for oxygen evolution in acidic media. Importantly, this work provides a new enrooted&#8208;type supported metal catalyst, which endows suitable MSI and maximizes the exposure of surface active sites in contrast to the conventional adhered, embedded, and encapsulated types.

         <title>Macrocycle&#8208;Based Charge Transfer Cocrystals with Dynamically Reversible Chiral Self&#8208;Sorting Display Chain Length&#8208;Selective Vapochromism to Alkyl Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral macrocycle&#8208;based cocrystal system that undergoes dynamically reversible chiral self&#8208;sorting displays efficient chain length&#8208;selective vapochromism to alkyl ketones. The unique vapochromic behavior was mainly due to different solid&#8208;state superstructures and noncovalent interactions from the homo&#8208; or heterochiral self&#8208;assembly.







Abstract
Chirality&#8208;driven self&#8208;sorting plays an essential role in controlling the biofunction of biosystems, such as the chiral double&#8208;helix structure of DNA from self&#8208;recognition by hydrogen bonding. However, achieving precise control over the chiral self&#8208;sorted structures and their functional properties for the bioinspired supramolecular systems still remains a challenge, not to mention realizing dynamically reversible regulation. Herein, we report an unprecedented saucer[4]arene&#8208;based charge transfer (CT) cocrystal system with dynamically reversible chiral self&#8208;sorting synergistically induced by chiral triangular macrocycle and organic vapors. It displays efficient chain length&#8208;selective vapochromism toward alkyl ketones due to precise modulation of optical properties by vapor&#8208;induced diverse structural transformations. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the unique vapochromic behavior is mainly attributed to the formation of homo&#8208; or heterochiral self&#8208;sorted assemblies with different alkyl ketone guests, which differ dramatically in solid&#8208;state superstructures and CT interactions, thus influencing their optical properties. This work highlights the essential role of chiral self&#8208;sorting in controlling the functional properties of synthetic supramolecular systems, and the rarely seen controllable chiral self&#8208;sorting at the solid&#8208;vapor interface deepens the understanding of efficient vapochromic sensors.

A hexagonal prism&#8208;shaped crystal known as KBCOB, renowned for its exceptional second&#8208;harmonic generation response and high transparency in the deep ultraviolet spectrum, is shown on the cover image. At the center of the image, the crystal's chemical structure is depicted. This structure consists of a tri&#8208;layered arrangement of green, multifaceted polyhedral units [B4O5(OH)4]2&#8722; representing the borate's boron&#8208;oxygen framework. Uniquely, the center of the crystal features a rarely reported superhalogen [BO2]&#8722; configuration, as demonstrated by Chi Zhang et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202403328).

THz spectra of aqueous solutions at ambient conditions encode precious information about H&#8208;bonding, but what about aqueous solutions at supercritical conditions? In their Research Article (e202402120) on neutral gold particles in supercritical water Jan Noetzel et&#8197;al. show that a broad continuum absorption comes from the metal particles while an additional sharp THz resonance is due to strongly interacting water.

Photocatalytic electron transfer commonly depends on scarce and precious transition metals like Ru and Ir due to their exceptional photophysical properties. In their Research Article (e202405780), Patrick Nuernberger, Regina de&#8197;Vivie&#8208;Riedle, Robert Wolf et&#8197;al. present an alternative approach using readily available complexes with earth&#8208;abundant 3d metals. Despite their short excited&#8208;state lifetimes, photocatalysis is made possible by dispersive preassembly in the ground state, opening exciting opportunities for new catalytic applications in organic synthesis.

A photostable and environment&#8208;sensitive probe for imaging inner mitochondrial membranes is presented by Masayasu Taki, Shigehiro Yamaguchi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202404328). The probe can visualize the lipid properties of the membranes as it alters spatiotemporally in living cells. Peroxidation of unsaturated lipids in the inner membrane results in membrane remodeling, which leads to an increase in membrane order.

         <title>Recent Progress in Using Covalent Organic Frameworks to Stabilize Metal Anodes for Highly&#8208;Efficient Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a comprehensive discussion of the advantages and challenges of alkali metals and multivalent metals as anodes, this minireview summarizes the latest progress on the application of COFs in electrode engineering, electrolyte optimization, and separator modification. Emphasis is placed on new insights into the synthesis, design, and characterization analysis of COFs to effectively improve metal anode performance.







Abstract
Alkali metals (e.g. Li, Na, and K) and multivalent metals (e.g. Zn, Mg, Ca, and Al) have become star anodes for developing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries due to their high theoretical capacity and excellent conductivity. However, the inevitable dendrites and unstable interfaces of metal anodes pose challenges to the safety and stability of batteries. To address these issues, covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as emerging materials, have been widely investigated due to their regular porous structure, flexible molecular design, and high specific surface area. In this minireview, we summarize the research progress of COFs in stabilizing metal anodes. First, we present the research origins of metal anodes and delve into their advantages and challenges as anodes based on the physical/chemical properties of alkali and multivalent metals. Then, special attention has been paid to the application of COFs in the host design of metal anodes, artificial solid electrolyte interfaces, electrolyte additives, solid&#8208;state electrolytes, and separator modifications. Finally, a new perspective is provided for the research of metal anodes from the molecular design, pore modulation, and synthesis of COFs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alkali metals (e.g. Li, Na, and K) and multivalent metals (e.g. Zn, Mg, Ca, and Al) have become star anodes for developing high-energy-density rechargeable batteries due to their high theoretical capacity and excellent conductivity. However, the inevitable dendrites and unstable interfaces of metal anodes pose challenges to the safety and stability of batteries. To address these issues, covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as emerging materials, have been widely investigated due to their regular porous structure, flexible molecular design, and high specific surface area. In this minireview, we summarize the research progress of COFs in stabilizing metal anodes. First, we present the research origins of metal anodes and delve into their advantages and challenges as anodes based on the physical/chemical properties of alkali and multivalent metals. Then, special attention has been paid to the application of COFs in the host design of metal anodes, artificial solid electrolyte interfaces, electrolyte additives, solid-state electrolytes, and separator modifications. Finally, a new perspective is provided for the research of metal anodes from the molecular design, pore modulation, and synthesis of COFs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>To DISP or Not? The Far&#8208;Reaching Reaction Mechanisms Underpinning Lithium&#8208;Air Batteries</title>

Views on the mechanism of metal&#8208;air batteries have seen a remarkable number of U&#8208;turns, which changed paradigms on how to improve performance. The latest findings show that the disproportionation (DISP) step in the (dis)charge mechanism emerges as the pivot point for explaining rate and capacity limitation as well as the origin of side reactions. Therefrom, directions emerge for materials design to enable high rate and high reversible capacity.







Abstract
The short history of research on Li&#8722;O2 batteries has seen a remarkable number of mechanistic U&#8208;turns over the years. From the initial use of carbonate electrolytes, that were then found to be entirely unsuitable, to the belief that (su)peroxide was solely responsible for degradation, before the more reactive singlet oxygen was found to form, to the hypothesis that capacity depends on a competing surface/solution mechanism before a practically exclusive solution mechanism was identified. Herein, we argue for an ever&#8208;fresh look at the reported data without bias towards supposedly established explanations. We explain how the latest findings on rate and capacity limits, as well as the origin of side reactions, are connected via the disproportionation (DISP) step in the (dis)charge mechanism. Therefrom, directions emerge for the design of electrolytes and mediators on how to suppress side reactions and to enable high rate and high reversible capacity.

         <title>An Unprecedented [BO2]&#8208;Based Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Transparent Nonlinear Optical Crystal by Superhalogen Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first [BO2]&#8208;based deep&#8208;UV transparent NLO oxide K9[B4O5(OH)4]3(CO3)(BO2) has been synthesized by an ambient aqueous evaporation method. It possesses a strong phase&#8208;matchable SHG, a short UV absorption edge, and a significantly enlarged birefringence by a superhalogen substitution strategy.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state structures with the superhalogen [BO2]&#8722; have thus far only been observed with a few compounds whose syntheses require high reaction temperatures and complicated procedures, while their optical properties remain almost completely unexplored. Herein, we report a facile, energy&#8208;efficient synthesis of the first [BO2]&#8208;based deep&#8208;ultraviolet (deep&#8208;UV) transparent oxide K9[B4O5(OH)4]3(CO3)(BO2)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;7H2O (KBCOB). Detailed structural characterization and analysis confirm that KBCOB possesses a rare four&#8208;in&#8208;one three&#8208;dimensional quasi&#8208;honeycomb framework, with three &#960;&#8208;conjugated anions ([BO2]&#8722;, [BO3]3&#8722;, and [CO3]2&#8722;) and one non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated anion ([BO4]5&#8722;) in the one crystal. The evolution from the traditional halogenated nonlinear optical (NLO) analogues to KBCOB by superhalogen [BO2]&#8722; substitution confers deep&#8208;UV transparency (&lt;190&#8197;nm), a large second&#8208;harmonic generation response (1.0&#215;KH2PO4 @&#8197;1064&#8197;nm), and a 15&#8208;fold increase in birefringence. This study affords a new route to the facile synthesis of functional [BO2]&#8208;based oxides, paving the way for the development of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performing deep&#8208;UV NLO materials.

         <title>Synthesis of Unsymmetrical Trisulfides from S&#8208;Substituted Sulphenylthiosulphates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a general and efficient approach for accessing unsymmetrical trisulfides through an I2&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling of S&#8208;substituted sulphenylthiosulphates (RSSSO3Na), alkyl electrophiles and thiourea. This is the first report on utilizing RSSSO3Na as disulfurating reagent and provides a convenient method for converting bromides, chlorides, iodides and tosylates into trisulfides.







Abstract
Trisulfide unit is widely found in natural products and has garnered attention due to the unique pharmacological and physiochemical properties. However, despite limited progress, widely applicable approaches for constructing unsymmetrical trisulfides have so far remain scarce. In this work, an easy&#8208;to&#8208;prepare, solid&#8208;state and scalable reagent, S&#8208;substituted sulphenylthiosulphate, has been developed for the divergent synthesis of unsymmetrical trisulfides. Alkyl electrophile substrates, including bromides, chlorides, iodides and tosylates, with diverse substituents are smoothly converted to the corresponding trisulfides with S&#8208;substituted sulphenylthiosulphates and thiourea as another sulfur source. Furthermore, the late&#8208;stage modification of drug molecules was successfully achieved through this method.

         <title>Kinase Inhibition via Small Molecule&#8208;Induced Intramolecular Protein Cross&#8208;Linking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report ynamide&#8208;based, small&#8208;molecule inhibitors capable of inducing intramolecular cross&#8208;linking of kinases, leading to subsequent irreversible inhibition of kinase activity. This strategy exploits the close distance between highly conserved catalytic K and E/D residues present in almost all protein kinases, thus providing a conceptually general approach to achieve irreversible kinase inhibition with high specificity and cellular potency.







Abstract
Remarkable progress has been made in the development of cysteine&#8208;targeted covalent inhibitors. In kinase drug discovery, covalent inhibitors capable of targeting other nucleophilic residues (i.e. lysine, or K) have emerged in recent years. Besides a highly conserved catalytic lysine, almost all human protein kinases possess an equally conserved glutamate/aspartate (e.g. E/D) that forms a K&#8211;E/D salt bridge within the enzyme's active site. Electrophilic ynamides were previously used as effective peptide coupling reagents and to develop E/D&#8208;targeting covalent protein inhibitors/probes. In the present study, we report the first ynamide&#8208;based small&#8208;molecule inhibitors capable of inducing intramolecular cross&#8208;linking of various protein kinases, leading to subsequent irreversible inhibition of kinase activity. Our strategy took advantage of the close distance between the highly conserved catalytic K and E/D residues in a targeted kinase, thus providing a conceptually general approach to achieve irreversible kinase inhibition with high specificity and desirable cellular potency. Finally, this ynamide&#8208;facilitated, ligand&#8208;induced mechanism leading to intramolecular kinase cross&#8208;linking and inhibition was unequivocally established by using recombinant ABL kinase as a representative.

Cyclotetramerization of 2&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;3&#8208;aryl&#8208;pyrroles affords a novel class of C4&#8208;symmetric Caryl&#8722;C&#946; (C3, C8, C13, C18) axially chiral porphyrins in good yields. Both regioisomers of the Ir&#8208;complex catalyze efficiently the carbene C(sp3)&#8722;H insertion reaction.







Abstract
A hitherto unknown class of C4&#8208;symmetric Caryl&#8722;C&#946; (C3, C8, C13, C18) axially chiral porphyrins has been synthesized and the application of their iridium (Ir) complexes in catalytic asymmetric C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization is documented. Cyclotetramerization of enantioenriched axially chiral 2&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;3&#8208;naphthyl pyrroles under mild acidic conditions affords, after oxidation with 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ), the C4&#8208;symmetric &#945;,&#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;atropenantiomer as an only isolable diastereomer. Both regioisomeric Ir(Por*)(CO)(Cl) complexes catalyze the carbene C&#8722;H insertion reaction affording the same enantiomer, albeit with slight difference in enantioselectivity. With the optimum Ir&#8208;complex 3&#8201;e, the 2&#8208;substituted arylacetic acid derivatives were generated from diazo compounds and cyclohexadiene in excellent yields and enantioselectivities.

         <title>Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed and Pnictogen Bond&#8208;Assisted Access to PIII&#8208;Stereogenic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic approach for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral PIII compounds by combining intramolecular PnB interactions and carbene catalysis was developed. The Lewis acidic P center simultaneously activate the bonded formyl group and stabilize the conformation of Breslow intermediates, it may help to achieve high stereo and regio&#8208;selectivities. Following the oxidation of the Breslow intermediate, nucleophile facilitates recycling of NHC to generate enantioenriched trivalent phosphorus compounds.







Abstract
Intermolecular pnictogen bonding (PnB) catalysis has received increased interest in non&#8208;covalent organocatalysis. It has been demonstrated that organic electron&#8208;deficient pnictogen atoms can act as prospective Lewis acids. Here, we present a catalytic approach for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral PIII compounds by combining intramolecular PnB interactions and carbene catalysis. Our design features a pre&#8208;chiral phosphorus molecule bearing two electron&#8208;withdrawing benzoyl groups, resulting in the formation of a &#963;&#8208;hole at the P atom. X&#8208;ray and non&#8208;covalent interaction (NCI) analysis indicate that the model substrates exhibit intrinsic PnB interaction between the oxygen atom of the formyl group and the phosphorus atom. This induces a conformational locking effect, leading to the crystallization of the phosphorus substrate in a preferred conformation (P212121 chiral group). Under the catalysis of N&#8211;heterocyclic carbene, the aldehyde moiety activated by the pnictogen bond selectively reacts with an alcohol to yield the corresponding chiral monoester/phosphorus product with excellent enantioselectivity. This Lewis acidic phosphorus center, aroused by the non&#8208;polarized intramolecular pnictogen bond interaction, assists in conformational and selective regulations, providing unique opportunities for catalysis and beyond.

         <title>Domain Swapping in Abiotic Foldamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abiotic foldamers have been shown to reproduce some of the patterns of protein folding in organic solvents, including cooperative folding transition and the accommodation of conformational strain within tertiary folds. Here, we show that a foldamer initially designed to form a quaternary structure in fact leads to a domain&#8208;swapped dimer, another pattern well&#8208;known in proteins.







Abstract
Foldamer sequences that adopt tertiary helix&#8208;turn&#8208;helix folds mediated by helix&#8208;helix hydrogen bonding in organic solvents have been previously reported. In an attempt to create genuine abiotic quaternary structures, i.e. assemblies of tertiary structures, new sequences were prepared that possess additional hydrogen bond donors at positions that may promote an association between the tertiary folds. However, a solid state structure and extensive solution state investigations by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Circular Dichroism (CD) show that, instead of forming a quaternary structure, the tertiary folds assemble into stable domain&#8208;swapped dimer motifs. Domain swapping entails a complete reorganization of the arrays of hydrogen bonds and changes in relative helix orientation and handedness that can all be rationalized.

         <title>Coupling Nano and Atomic Electric Field Confinement for Robust Alkaline Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergy of nano and atomic electric field confinement enrich OH&#8722; concentration around the surface of the catalyst and facilitates *O desorption. As such, the designed Mn single atom doped CoP nanoneedles exhibit an ultra&#8208;low overpotential of 189&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and stability over 100&#8197;h at around 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 during alkaline OER.







Abstract
The alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a promising avenue for producing clean fuels and storing intermittent energy. However, challenges such as excessive OH&#8722; consumption and strong adsorption of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates hinder the development of alkaline OER. In this study, we propose a cooperative strategy by leveraging both nano&#8208;scale and atomically local electric fields for alkaline OER, demonstrated through the synthesis of Mn single atom doped CoP nanoneedles (Mn SA&#8208;CoP NNs). Finite element method simulations and density functional theory calculations predict that the nano&#8208;scale local electric field enriches OH&#8722; around the catalyst surface, while the atomically local electric field improves *O desorption. Experimental validation using in situ attenuated total reflection infrared and Raman spectroscopy confirms the effectiveness of the nano&#8208;scale and atomically electric fields. Mn SA&#8208;CoP NNs exhibit an ultra&#8208;low overpotential of 189&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and stable operation over 100&#8197;hours at ~100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 during alkaline OER. This innovative strategy provides new insights for enhancing catalyst performance in energy conversion reactions.

         <title>A New Family of High Oxidation State Antiperovskite Nitrides: La3MN5 (M=Cr, Mn and Mo)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>

La3MN5 (M=Cr, Mn, and Mo) are the first examples of ternary antiperovskite (Cs3CoCl5&#8208;type) nitrides containing [MN4]6&#8722; anions for M=Cr and Mo, but for M=Mn off&#8208;stoichiometry modelled by excess&#8208;nitride clusters gives La3MnN5.30 with Mn oxidised almost to the +7 state. This is the first report of excess&#8208;anion incorporation into Cs3CoCl5&#8208;type materials, and this or other mechanisms may enable many other high oxidation state transition metal nitrides to be prepared.







Abstract
Three new nitrides La3MN5 (M=Cr, Mn, and Mo) have been synthesized using a high pressure azide route. These are the first examples of ternary Cs3CoCl5&#8208;type nitrides, and show that this (MN4)NLa3 antiperovskite structure type may be used to stabilise high oxidation&#8208;state transition metals in tetrahedral molecular [MN4]n&#8722; nitridometallate anions. Magnetic measurements confirm that Cr and Mo are in the M6+ state, but the M=Mn phase has an anomalously small paramagnetic moment and large cell volume. Neutron powder diffraction data are fitted using an anion&#8208;excess La3MnN5.30 model (space group I4/mcm, a=6.81587(9)&#8197;&#197; and c=11.22664(18)&#8197;&#197; at 200&#8197;K) in which Mn is close to the +7 state. Excess&#8208;anion incorporation into Cs3CoCl5&#8208;type materials has not been previously reported, and this or other substitution mechanisms may enable many other high oxidation state transition metal nitrides to be prepared.

         <title>Molecular Wiring of Electrocatalytic Nitrate reduction to Ammonia and Water Oxidation by Iron&#8208;Coordinated Macroporous Conductive Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general approach for synthesis of single&#8208;site active iron electrocatalysts is reported by integration of a solvated iron complex in conductive organic networks. Sufficient coordinatively unsaturated active sites can be created electrochemically for simultaneous NO3&#8722; reduction to NH3 and H2O oxidation to O2 in basic media.







Abstract
Developing stable electrocatalysts with accessible isolated sites is desirable but highly challenging due to metal agglomeration and low surface stability of host materials. Here we report a general approach for synthesis of single&#8208;site Fe electrocatalysts by integrating a solvated Fe complex in conductive macroporous organic networks through redox&#8208;active coordination linkages. Electrochemical activation of the electrode exposes high&#8208;density coordinately unsaturated Fe sites for efficient adsorption and conversion of reaction substrates such as NO3&#8722; and H2O. Using the electrode with isolated active Fe sites, electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction and H2O oxidation can be coupled in a single cell to produce NH3 and O2 at Faradaic efficiencies of 97&#8201;% and 100&#8201;%, respectively. The electrode exhibits excellent robustness in electrocatalysis for 200&#8197;hours with small decrease in catalytic efficiencies. Both the maximized Fe&#8208;site efficiency and the microscopic localization effect of the conductive organic matrix contribute to the high catalytic performances, which provides new understandings in tuning the efficiencies of metal catalysts for high&#8208;performance electrocatalytic cells.

         <title>Crystalline Olefin&#8208;Linked Chiral Covalent Organic Frameworks as a Platform for Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantiomeric olefin&#8208;linked covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs) are synthesized with uniform chiral catalytic sites on the pore walls, exhibiting satisfactory catalytic performance in enantioselective electrophilic amination reactions with good stability and recyclability.







Abstract
The construction of olefin&#8208;linked chiral covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high crystallinity is highly desirable while remains great challenge due to the poor reversibility of the formation reaction for the olefin linkages during the in situ structural self&#8208;healing process. Herein, we successfully synthesized two sets of enantiomeric olefin&#8208;linked COFs. The chiral catalytic groups are uniformly distributed on the pore walls of COFs, resulting in the full exposure of catalytic sites to the reactants in asymmetric catalysis. The as&#8208;prepared (R)/(S)&#8208;CCOF8 exhibits excellent catalytic performance with exceeding 99&#8201;% enantiomeric excess in the enantioselective electrophilic amination reaction. Moreover, the heterogeneous chiral catalysts are conveniently recycled and could maintain the performance after ten catalytic cycles. Our findings expand the scope to construct stable and crystalline chiral COFs for the asymmetric catalysis.

Type&#8197;I [4&#963;+4&#960;] and [4&#963;+4&#960;&#8722;1] cycloadditions were developed to access synthetically challenging seven/eight&#8208;membered fused carbocycles through rhodium&#8208;catalyzed coupling between 4&#963;&#8208;donor (benzocyclobutenones) and pendant diene (4&#960;) motifs in good yields (up to 90&#8201;%). A mechanism was proposed based on kinetic and 13C&#8208;labeling experiments. Notably, one product was found to be a potent and selective liver X receptor &#946; binding ligand (KD=0.64&#8197;&#956;M).







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed [4+4] cycloaddition leading to cyclooctanoids has centered on dimerization between 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;type substrates. Herein, we describe a [4&#963;+4&#960;&#8722;1] and [4&#963;+4&#960;] cycloaddition strategy to access 7/8&#8208;membered fused carbocycles through rhodium&#8208;catalyzed coupling between the 4&#963;&#8208;donor (benzocyclobutenones) and pendant diene (4&#960;) motifs. The two pathways can be controlled by adjusting the solvated CO concentration. A broad range (&gt;40 examples) of 5&#8211;6&#8211;7 and 5&#8211;6&#8211;8 polyfused carbocycles was obtained in good yields (up to 90&#8201;%). DFT calculations, kinetic monitoring and 13C&#8208;labeling experiments were carried out, suggesting a plausible mechanism. Notably, one 5&#8211;6&#8211;7 tricycle was found to be a very rare, potent, and selective ligand for the liver X receptor &#946; (KD=0.64&#8197;&#956;M), which is a potential therapeutic target for cholesterol&#8208;metabolism&#8208;related fatal diseases.

         <title>Water and Air Stable Copper(I) Complexes of Tetracationic Catenane Ligands for Oxidative C&#8722;C Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper(I) molecular catalysts that are water soluble and stable against oxidative degradation are obtained by the strategic use of multiply charged catenane ligands. By using the new catalysts, oxidative C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling is realized in water using H2O2 as a green and convenient oxidant, highlighting the potential of ligand interlocking in leveraging transition metal catalysis under challenging conditions.







Abstract
Aqueous soluble and stable Cu(I) molecular catalysts featuring a catenane ligand composed of two dicationic, mutually repelling but mechanically interlocked macrocycles are reported. The ligand interlocking not only fine&#8208;tunes the coordination sphere and kinetically stabilizes the Cu(I) against air oxidation and disproportionation, but also buries the hydrophobic portions of the ligands and prevents their dissociation which are necessary for their good water solubility and a sustained activity. These catenane Cu(I) complexes can catalyze the oxidative C&#8722;C coupling of indoles and tetrahydroisoquinolines in water, using H2O2 as a green oxidant with a good substrate scope.

     alt="Water and Air Stable Copper(I) Complexes of Tetracationic Catenane Ligands for Oxidative C&#8722;C Cross-Coupling"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper(I) molecular catalysts that are water soluble and stable against oxidative degradation are obtained by the strategic use of multiply charged catenane ligands. By using the new catalysts, oxidative C&#8722;C cross-coupling is realized in water using H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a green and convenient oxidant, highlighting the potential of ligand interlocking in leveraging transition metal catalysis under challenging conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous soluble and stable Cu(I) molecular catalysts featuring a catenane ligand composed of two dicationic, mutually repelling but mechanically interlocked macrocycles are reported. The ligand interlocking not only fine-tunes the coordination sphere and kinetically stabilizes the Cu(I) against air oxidation and disproportionation, but also buries the hydrophobic portions of the ligands and prevents their dissociation which are necessary for their good water solubility and a sustained activity. These catenane Cu(I) complexes can catalyze the oxidative C&#8722;C coupling of indoles and tetrahydroisoquinolines in water, using H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a green oxidant with a good substrate scope. The successful use of catenane ligands in exploiting aqueous Cu(I) catalysis thus highlights the many unexplored potential of mechanical bond as a design element for exploring transition metal catalysis under challenging conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Atom Transfer Enabled Catalytic Enantioselective Coupling to Chiral Trifluoromethylated Alkynes via Dual Nickel and Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With halogen&#8208;atom transfer as an effective tool, a novel catalytic enantioselective protocol generating chiral trifluoromethylated alkynes with high yields and selectivities has been established. It uses a cooperative photoredox and nickel catalysis system, and expands the nickel&#8208;catalysed asymmetric reductive cross&#8208;coupling of organohalides from the traditional single&#8208;electron transfer to halogen&#8208;atom transfer.







Abstract
With halogen&#8208;atom transfer as an effective tool, a novel catalytic enantioselective protocol to generate chiral trifluoromethylated alkynes has been established by a cooperative photoredox and nickel catalysis system, providing a straightforward and modular route to access this type of product in good yields and enantioselectivities. The halogen&#8208;atom transfer process is essential for the reaction and this novel strategy offers another promising way to utilize alkyl halides with highly negative reduction potentials. It firstly expands nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reductive cross&#8208;couplings of organohalides from the traditional single&#8208;electron transfer to halogen&#8208;atom transfer.

         <title>Formation of Supernarrow Borophene Nanoribbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of supernarrow borophene nanoribbons has been experimentally realized. The ribbons have a uniform width of &#8764;10&#8197;&#197; and can be as long as 200&#8197;&#197;. They are embedded in the outermost layer of Au(111) and shielded on top by evacuated Au atoms. Distinct edge states are revealed from the ribbons, which are primarily attributed to the localized spin at their zigzag edges.







Abstract
Borophenes have sparked considerable interest owing to their fascinating physical characteristics and diverse polymorphism. However, borophene nanoribbons (BNRs) with widths less than 2&#8197;nm have not been achieved. Herein, we report the experimental realization of supernarrow BNRs. Combining scanning tunneling microscopy imaging with density functional theory modeling and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that, under the applied growth conditions, boron atoms can penetrate the outermost layer of Au(111) and form BNRs composed of a pair of zigzag (2,2) boron rows. The BNRs have a width self&#8208;contained to &#8764;1&#8197;nm and dipoles at the edges to keep them separated. They are embedded in the outermost Au layer and shielded on top by the evacuated Au atoms, free of the need for post&#8208;passivation. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals distinct edge states, primarily attributed to the localized spin at the BNRs&#8217; zigzag edges. This work adds a new member to the boron material family and introduces a new physical feature to borophenes.

         <title>Triaryl Carbenium Ion Pair Mediated Electrocatalytic Benzylic C&#8722;H Oxygenation in Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ion&#8208;pair [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722;&#8208;mediated electrocatalytic benzylic C&#8722;H oxidation is described. In the absence of expensive oxidants and external supporting electrolyte, the selective oxidation of benzylic C&#8722;H bonds in air was achieved.







Abstract
The selective oxidation of benzylic C&#8722;H bonds is a pivotal transformation in organic synthesis. Undoubtedly, achieving efficient and highly selective aerobic oxidation of methylarenes to benzaldehydes has been highly challenging due to the propensity of benzaldehyde to undergo overoxidation under typical aerobic conditions. Herein, we propose an innovative approach to address this issue by leveraging electrocatalytic processes, facilitated by ion&#8208;pair mediators [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722;. By harnessing the power of electrochemistry, we successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of our strategy, which enables the selective oxidation of benzylic C&#8722;H bonds in benzylic molecules and toluene derivatives. Notably, our approach exhibited high efficiency, excellent selectivity, and compatibility with various functional groups, underscoring the broad applicability of our methodology.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Transfer Hydrogenation of 1&#8208;Octene with [(tBuPCP)Ir(H)(Cl)] and Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the quantitative electro&#8208;hydrogenation of unactivated alkenes with H2O in neutral or even alkaline conditions. Electro&#8208;hydrogenation is typically driven by H+ reduction in acidic media to generate reactive metal&#8208;hydrides, which then either hydrogenate or react with H+ to liberate H2 in a parasitic process. Our work shows that H2 evolution can be suppressed by forming metal&#8208;hydrides via oxidative addition of H2O instead of H+ reduction.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of 1&#8208;octene as non&#8208;activated model substrate with neutral water as H&#8208;donor is reported, using [(tBuPCP)Ir(H)(Cl)] (1) as the catalyst, to form octane with high faradaic efficiency (FE) of 96&#8201;% and a kobs of 87&#8197;s&#8722;1. Cyclic voltammetry with 1 revealed that two subsequent reductions trigger the elimination of Cl&#8722; and afford the highly reactive anionic Ir(I) hydride complex [(tBuPCP)Ir(H)]&#8722; (2), a previously merely proposed intermediate for which we now report first experimental data by mass spectrometry. In absence of alkene, the stoichiometric electrolysis of 1 in THF with water selectively affords the Ir(III) dihydride complex [(tBuPCP)Ir(H)2] (3) in 88&#8201;% FE from the reaction of 2 with H2O. Complex 3 then hydrogenates the alkene in classical fashion. The presented electro&#8208;hydrogenation works with extremely high FE, because the iridium hydrides are water stable, which prevents H2 formation. Even in strongly alkaline conditions (Bu4NOH added), the electro&#8208;hydrogenation of 1&#8208;octene with 1 also proceeds cleanly (89&#8201;% FE), suggesting a highly robust process that may rely on H2O activation, reminiscent to transfer hydrogenation pathways, instead of classical H+ reduction. DFT calculations confirmed oxidative addition of H2O as a key step in this context.

         <title>Symmetric Electron Transfer Coordinates are Intrinsic to Bridged Systems: An ab Initio Treatment of the Creutz&#8211;Taube Ion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We identify a symmetric dimension that is important for electron transfer or electronic localization from quantum chemical calculations and find that it naturally occurs in bridged mixed&#8208;valent systems as a consequence of the superexchange coupling mechanism.







Abstract
A long&#8208;standing question in electron transfer research concerns the number and identity of collective nuclear motions that drive electron transfer or localisation. It is well established that these nuclear motions are commonly gathered into a so&#8208;called electron transfer coordinate. In this theoretical study, we demonstrate that both anti&#8208;symmetric and symmetric vibrational motions are intrinsic to bridged systems, and that both are required to explain the characteristic shape of their intervalence charge transfer bands. Using the properties of a two&#8208;state Marcus&#8211;Hush model, we identify and quantify these two coordinates as linear combinations of normal modes from ab initio calculations. This quantification gives access to the potential coupling, reorganization energy and curvature of the potential energy surfaces involved in electron transfer, independent of any prior assumptions about the system of interest. We showcase these claims with the Creutz&#8211;Taube ion, a prototypical Class III mixed valence complex. We find that the symmetric dimension is responsible for the asymmetric band shape, and trace this back to the offset of the ground and excited state potentials in this dimension. The significance of the symmetric dimension originates from geometry dependent coupling, which in turn is a natural consequence of the well&#8208;established superexchange mechanism. The conceptual connection between the symmetric and anti&#8208;symmetric motions and the superexchange mechanism appears as a general result for bridged systems.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Strained Amino Acids by a PLP&#8208;Dependent Enzyme through Cryptic Halogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halogenases enable organisms to alter the reactivity of a biological substrate by enzymatically installing a leaving group. In this communication, we discover a bacterial gene cluster which uses a pyridoxal 5&#8242;&#8208;phosphate&#8208;dependent enzyme to form strained carbocyclic amino acids from halogenated substrates. We also examine the role of the non&#8208;canonical amino acid pazamine in plant&#8208;bacterial interactions.







Abstract
Amino acids (AAs) are modular building blocks which nature uses to synthesize both macromolecules, such as proteins, and small molecule natural products, such as alkaloids and non&#8208;ribosomal peptides. While the 20 main proteinogenic AAs display relatively limited side chain diversity, a wide range of non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) exist that are not used by the ribosome for protein synthesis, but contain a broad array of structural features and functional groups. In this communication, we report the discovery of the biosynthetic pathway for a new ncAA, pazamine, which contains a cyclopropane ring formed in two steps. In the first step, a chlorine is added onto the C4 position of lysine by a radical halogenase, PazA. The cyclopropane ring is then formed in the next step by a pyridoxal&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;phosphate&#8208;dependent enzyme, PazB, via an SN2&#8208;like attack at C4 to eliminate chloride. Genetic studies of this pathway in the native host, Pseudomonas azotoformans, show that pazamine potentially inhibits ethylene biosynthesis in growing plants based on alterations in the root phenotype of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. We further show that PazB can be utilized to make an alternative cyclobutane&#8208;containing AA. These discoveries may lead to advances in biocatalytic production of specialty chemicals and agricultural biotechnology.

         <title>A Systematic Study of Methyl Carbodithioate Esters as Effective Gold Contact Groups for Single&#8208;Molecule Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Carbodithioate ester&#8208;containing molecular wires have been synthesized and characterized to demonstrate the functionality as a great contact group for molecular electronics with good all&#8208;around properties including strong surface binding and high conductance. Raman, XPS and theoretical calculations support the STM&#8208;BJ conductance data and rationalize the binding groups&#8217; performance through a strong C=S to Au interaction.







Abstract
There are several binding groups used within molecular electronics for anchoring molecules to metal electrodes (e.g., R&#8722;SMe, R&#8722;NH2, R&#8722;CS2&#8722;, R&#8722;S&#8722;). However, some anchoring groups that bind strongly to electrodes have poor/unknown stability, some have weak electrode coupling, while for some their binding motifs are not well defined. Further binding groups are required to aid molecular design and to achieve a suitable balance in performance across a range of properties. We present an in&#8208;depth investigation into the use of carbodithioate esters as contact groups for single&#8208;molecule conductance measurements, using scanning tunnelling microscopy break junction measurements (STM&#8208;BJ) and detailed surface spectroscopic analysis. We demonstrate that the methyl carbodithioate ester acts as an effective contact for gold electrodes in STM&#8208;BJ measurements. Surface enhanced Raman measurements demonstrate that the C=S functionality remains intact when adsorbed on to gold nanoparticles. A gold(I) complex was also synthesised showing a stable C=S&#8594;AuI interaction from the ester. Comparison with a benzyl thiomethyl ether demonstrates that the C=S moiety significantly contributes to charge transport in single&#8208;molecule junctions. The overall performance of the CS2Me group demonstrates it should be used more extensively and has strong potential for the fabrication of larger area devices with long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Function Relationship of p&#8208;Block Bismuth for Selective Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A volcano&#8208;type structure&#8208;function relationship of p&#8208;block Bi element for selectivity CH4 was found. The CH4 selectivity of the p&#8208;block Bi element is also positively correlated with adsorption energy of *CHO. Further analysis indicates that the interaction in VO/Bi heterosites on Bi2MoO6 enhances the absorption and activation of *CHO, facilitates the *CO&#8208;*CHO process, and enriches carriers at the active site for photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion.







Abstract
Selective photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to value&#8208;added fuels, such as CH4, is highly desirable due to its high mass&#8208;energy density. Nevertheless, achieving selective CH4 with higher production yield on p&#8208;block materials is hindered by non&#8208;ideal adsorption of *CHO key intermediate and an unclear structure&#8208;function relationship. Herein, we unlock the key reaction steps of CO2 and found a volcano&#8208;type structure&#8208;function relationship for photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion by gradual reduction of the p&#8208;band center of the p&#8208;block Bi element leading to formation of Bi&#8208;oxygen vacancy heterosites. The selectivity of CH4 is also positive correlation with adsorption energy of *CHO. The Bi&#8208;oxygen vacancy heterosites with an appropriate filled Bi&#8208;6p orbital electrons and p band center (&#8722;0.64) enhance the coupling between C&#8208;2p of *CHO and Bi&#8208;6p orbitals, thereby resulting in high selectivity (95.2&#8201;%) and productivity (17.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) towards CH4. Further studies indicate that the synergistic effect between Bi&#8208;oxygen vacancy heterosites reduces Gibbs free energy for *CO&#8208;*CHO process, activates the C&#8722;H and C=O bonds of *CHO, and facilitates the enrichment of photoexcited electrons at active sites for multielectron photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion. This work provides a new perspective on developing p&#8208;block elements for selective photocatalytic CO2 conversion.

         <title>Digital Light Processing to Afford High Resolution and Degradable CO2&#8208;Derived Copolymer Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thiol&#8208;ene based 3D printing of a low molar mass CO2&#8208; and bio&#8208;derived ABA triblock copolymer through digital light processing is reported. A series of sustainable elastomers are produced with varying thiol cross&#8208;linker lengths and poly(ethylene glycol) content to print complex geometries at high resolution. The materials display printing induced phase separation, tunable hydrophilicity, and complete hydrolytic degradation.







Abstract
Vat photopolymerization 3D printing has proven very successful for the rapid additive manufacturing (AM) of polymeric parts at high resolution. However, the range of materials that can be printed and their resulting properties remains narrow. Herein, we report the successful AM of a series of poly(carbonate&#8208;b&#8208;ester&#8208;b&#8208;carbonate) elastomers, derived from carbon dioxide and bio&#8208;derived &#1013;&#8208;decalactone. By employing a highly active and selective Co(II)Mg(II) polymerization catalyst, an ABA triblock copolymer (Mn=6.3&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1, &#208;M=1.26) was synthesized, formulated into resins which were 3D printed using digital light processing (DLP) and a thiol&#8208;ene&#8208;based crosslinking system. A series of elastomeric and degradable thermosets were produced, with varying thiol cross&#8208;linker length and poly(ethylene glycol) content, to produce complex triply periodic geometries at high resolution. Thermomechanical characterization of the materials reveals printing&#8208;induced microphase separation and tunable hydrophilicity. These findings highlight how utilizing DLP can produce sustainable materials from low molar mass polyols quickly and at high resolution. The 3D printing of these functional materials may help to expedite the production of sustainable plastics and elastomers with potential to replace conventional petrochemical&#8208;based options.

         <title>Tris(triazolo)triazine&#8208;based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficiently Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) have recently emerged as fascinating scaffolds for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion because of their customizable structures and functionalities. Herein, two tris(triazolo)triazine&#8208;based COF materials (namely COF&#8208;JLU51 and COF&#8208;JLU52) featuring large surface area, high crystallinity, excellent stability and photoelectric properties were designed and constructed for the first time. Remarkably, COF&#8208;JLU51 gave an outstanding H2O2 production rate of over 4200 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with excellent reusability in pure water and O2 under one standard sun light, that higher than its isomorphic COF&#8208;JLU52 and most of the reported metal&#8208;free materials, owing to its superior generation, separation and transport of photogenerated carriers. Experimental and theoretical researches prove that the photocatalytic process undergoes a combination of indirect 2e&#8722; O2 reduction reaction (ORR) and 4e&#8722; H2O oxidation reaction (WOR). Specifically, an ultrahigh yield of 7624.7 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with apparent quantum yield of 18.2% for COF&#8208;JLU52 was achieved in a 1:1 ratio of benzyl alcohol and water system. This finding contributes novel, nitrogen&#8208;rich and high&#8208;quality tris(triazolo)triazine&#8208;based COF materials, and also designate their bright future in photocatalytic solar transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereodivergent Total Synthesis of Tacaman Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: This paper describes a concise, asymmetric and stereodivergent total synthesis of tacaman alkaloids. A key step in this synthesis is the biocatalytic Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation of cyclohexanone, which was developed to produce seven&#8208;membered lactones and establish the required stereochemistry at the C14 position (92% yield, 99% ee, 500 mg scale). Cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;tetracyclic indoloquinolizidine scaffolds were rapidly synthesized through an acid&#8208;triggered, tunable acyl&#8208;Pictet&#8208;Spengler type cyclization cascade, serving as the pivotal reaction for building the alkaloid skeleton. Computational results revealed that hydrogen bonding was crucial in stabilizing intermediates and inducing different addition reactions during the acyl&#8208;Pictet&#8208;Spengler cyclization cascade. By strategically using these two reactions and the late&#8208;stage diversification of the functionalized indoloquinolizidine core, the asymmetric total syntheses of eight tacaman alkaloids were achieved. This study may potentially advance research related to the medicinal chemistry of tacaman alkaloids.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking the Power of Human Ferritin: Enhanced Drug Delivery of Aurothiomalate in A2780 Ovarian Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aurothiomalate (AuTM) is an FDA&#8208;approved antiarthritic gold drug with unique anticancer properties. To enhance its anticancer activity, we prepared a bioconjugate with human apoferritin (HuHf) by attaching some AuTM moieties to surface protein residues. The reaction of apoferritin with excess AuTM yielded a single adduct, that was characterized by ESI MS and ICP&#8208;OES analysis, using three mutant ferritins and trypsinization experiments. The adduct contains ~3 gold atoms per ferritin subunit, arranged in a small cluster bound to Cys90 and Cys102. MD simulations provide a plausible structural model for the cluster. The adduct was evaluated for its pharmacological properties and was found to be significantly more cytotoxic than free AuTM against A2780 cancer cells mainly due to higher gold uptake. NMR&#8208;metabolomics showed that AuTM bound to HuHf and free AuTM induced qualitatively similar changes in treated cancer cells, indicating that the effects on cell metabolism are approximately the same, in agreement with independent biochemical experiments. In conclusion, we have demonstrated here that a molecularly precise bioconjugate formed between AuTM and HuHf exhibits anticancer properties far superior to the free drug, while retaining its key mechanistic features. Evidence is provided that human ferritin can serve as an excellent carrier for this metallodrug.</dc:description>

         <title>Lattice Strain Engineering Boosts&#160;CO2 Electroreduction to C2+&#160;Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulating the binding effect between the surface of an&#160;electrode material and reaction intermediates is essential in highly efficient CO2 electro&#8208;reduction to produce high&#8208;value multicarbon (C2+)&#160;compounds. Theoretical study reveals that lattice tensile strain in single&#8208;component Cu&#160;catalysts can reduce the dipole&#8211;dipole repulsion between *CO intermediates and promotes *OH adsorption, and the high *CO and *OH coverage decreases the energy barrier for C&#8211;C coupling. In this work, Cu catalysts with varying lattice tensile strain were fabricated by electro&#8208;reducing CuO precursors with different crystallinity, without adding any extra components. The as&#8208;prepared single&#8208;component Cu catalysts were used for CO2 electro&#8208;reduction, and it is discovered that the lattice tensile strain in Cu could enhance the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ products effectively. Especially, the as&#8208;prepared CuTPA catalyst with high lattice tensile strain&#160;achieves a FEC2+ of 90.9% at &#8722;1.25 V vs. RHE with a partial current density of 486.1 mA cm&#8722;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Layered Membranes with Precisely Controlled Nano&#8208;Confined Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanosheets&#8208;based membranes, which have controlled 2D nano&#8208;confined channels, are highly desirable for molecular/ionic sieving and confined reactions. However, it is still difficult to develop an efficient method to prepare large&#8208;area membranes with high stability, high orientation, and accurately adjustable interlayer spacing. Here, we present a strategy to produce metal ion cross&#8208;linked membranes with precisely controlled 2D nano&#8208;confined channels and high stability in different solutions using superspreading shear&#8208;flow&#8208;induced assembly strategy. For example, membranes based on graphene oxide (GO) exhibit interlayer spacing ranging from 8.0 &#177; 0.1 &#197; to 10.3 &#177; 0.2 &#197;, with a precision of down to 1 &#197;. At the same time, the value of the orientation order parameter (f) of GO membranes is up to 0.95 and GO membranes exhibit superb stability in different solutions. The strategy we present, which can be generalized to the preparation of 2D nano&#8208;confined channels based on a variety of 2D materials, will expand the application scope and provide better performances of membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Experimental and theoretical elucidation of the luminescence quenching mechanism in highly efficient Hg2+ and sulfadiazine sensing by Ln&#8208;MOF</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heavy metal ions and antibiotic contamination have become a major environmental concern worldwide. The development of efficient recognition strategies of these pollutants at ultra&#8208;low concentrations in aqueous solutions as well as the elucidation of the intrinsic sensing mechanism are challenging tasks. In this work, unique luminescent Ln&#8208;MOF materials (NIIC&#8208;3&#8208;Ln) were assembled by rational ligand design. Among them, NIIC&#8208;3&#8208;Tb demonstrated highly selective luminescence quenching response toward Hg2+ and sulfadiazine (SDI) at subnanomolar concentrations in less than 7 s. In addition, a Hg2+ sensing mechanism through chelation was proposed on the basis of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and Hg2+ adsorption study. The interaction mechanism of NIIC&#8208;3&#8208;Tb with SDI was revealed using a newly developed approach involving a (TD&#8208;)DFT based quantification of the charge transfer of a MOF&#8208;analyte supramolecular complex model in the ground and excited states. Effect of ultrasonic treatment on the surface morphology important for MOF sensing performance was revealed by gas adsorption experiments. The presented results indicate that NIIC&#8208;3&#8208;Ln is not only an advanced sensing material for the efficient detection of Hg2+ and SDI at ultra&#8208;low concentrations, but also opens up a new approach to study the sensing mechanism at the molecular level at ultra&#8208;low concentrations.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Elucidation of a Metagenomic Urethanase and Its Engineering Towards Enhanced Hydrolysis Profiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While plastics like polyethylene terephthalate can already be degraded efficiently by the activity of hydrolases, other synthetic polymers like polyurethanes (PUs) and polyamides (PAs) largely resist biodegradation. In this study, we solved the first crystal structure of the metagenomic urethanase UMG&#8208;SP&#8208;1, identified highly flexible loop regions to comprise active site residues, and targeted a total of 20 potential hot spots by site&#8208;saturation mutagenesis. Engineering campaigns yielded variants with single mutations, exhibiting almost 3&#8208; and 8&#8208;fold improved activity against highly stable N&#8208;aryl urethane and amide bonds, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrated the release of the corresponding monomers from a thermoplastic polyester&#8208;PU and a PA (nylon 6) by the activity of a single, metagenome&#8208;derived urethanase after short incubation times. Thereby, we expanded the hydrolysis profile of UMG&#8208;SP&#8208;1 beyond the reported low&#8208;molecular weight carbamates. Together, these findings promise advanced strategies for the bio&#8208;based degradation and recycling of plastic materials and waste, aiding efforts to establish a circular economy for synthetic polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Unravelling White Phosphorus: Experimental and Computational Studies Reveal the Mechanisms of P4 Hydrostannylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydrostannylation of white phosphorus (P4) allows this crucial industrial precursor to be easily transformed into useful P1 products via direct, &#8216;one pot&#8217; (or even catalytic) procedures. However, a thorough mechanistic understanding of this transformation has remained elusive, hindering attempts to use this rare example of successful, direct P4 functionalization as a model for further reaction development. Here, we provide a deep and generalizable mechanistic picture for P4 hydrostannylation by combining DFT calculations with in situ31P NMR reaction monitoring and kinetic trapping of previously unobservable reaction intermediates using bulky tin hydrides. The results offer important insights into both how this reaction proceeds and why it is successful and provide implicit guidelines for future research in the field of P4 activation.</dc:description>

         <title>A Tetracarbene Iron(II) Complex with a Long&#8208;lived Triplet Metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand Charge Transfer State due to a Triplet&#8208;Triplet Barrier</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mixed N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) / pyridyl iron(II) complexes have attracted a great deal of attention recently because of their potential as photocatalysts and light sensitizers made from Earth&#8208;abundant elements. The most decisive challenge for their successful implementation is the lifetime of the lowest triplet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer state (3MLCT), which typically decays via a triplet metal&#8208;centered (3MC) state back to the ground state. We reveal by variable&#8208;temperature ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy that the tripodal iron(II) bis(pyridine) complex isomers  trans&#8208; and cis&#8208;[Fe(pdmi)2]2+with four NHC donors show 3MLCT&#8594;3MC population transfers with very different barriers and rationalize this by computational means. While trans&#8208;[Fe(pdmi)2]2+possesses an unobservable activation barrier, the cis isomer exhibits a barrier of 492 cm&#8211;1, which leads to a nanosecond 3MLCT lifetime at 77 K. The kinetic and quantum chemical data were analyzed in the context of semi&#8208;classical Marcus theory revealing a high reorganization energy and small electronic coupling between the two triplet states. This highlights the importance of detailed structural control and kinetic knowledge for the rational design of photosensitizers from first row transition metals such as iron.</dc:description>

         <title>Cycloadditions of Diazoalkenes with P4 and tBuCP: Access to Diazaphospholes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diazoalkenes readily react with tert&#8209;butylphosphaalkyne (tBuCP) and white phosphorus (P4) to afford novel phosphorus heterocycles, 3H&#8209;1,2,4&#8208;diazamonophospholes and 1,2,3,4&#8208;diazadiphospholes. Both species represent rare examples of neutral heterophospholes. The mechanism of formation and the electronic structures of these formal (3+2) cycloaddition products were analyzed computationally. The new phospholes form structurally diverse coordination compounds with transition metal and main group elements. Given the growing number of stable diazoalkenes, this work offers a straightforward route to neutral aza(di&#8208;)phospholes as a new ligand class.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrophilic C(sp2)&#8211;H Cyanation with Inorganic Cyanate (OCN&#8211;) by PIII/PV=O&#8208;Catalyzed Phase Transfer Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An organophosphorus redox&#8208;catalyzed method for the direct electrophilic cyanation of C(sp2)&#8211;H nucleophiles with sodium cyanate (NaOCN) is reported. The catalytic deoxyfunctionalization of the OCN&#8211; anion is enabled by the use of a small&#8208;ring phosphacyclic (phosphetane) catalyst in combination with a terminal hydrosilane O&#8208;atom acceptor and a malonate&#8208;derived bromenium donor. In situ spectroscopy under single&#8208;turnover conditions demonstrate that insoluble inorganic cyanate anion is activated by bromide displacement on a bromophosphonium catalytic intermediate to give a reactive N&#8208;bound isocyanatophosphonium ion, which delivers electrophilic &#8220;CN+&#8221; equivalents to nucleophilic (hetero)arenes and alkenes with loss of a phosphine oxide. These results demonstrate the feasibility of deoxyfunctionalization of insoluble inorganic salts by PIII/PV=O catalyzed phase transfer activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystal Cage Framework with High Selectivity and Reversibility in Fullerene Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Host&#8208;guest chemistry, a pivotal branch of supramolecular chemistry, plays an essential role in understanding and constructing complex structures through non&#8208;covalent interactions. Organic molecular cages, characterized by their intrinsic confined cavities, can selectively bind a variety of guest molecules. Their host&#8208;guest chemistry has been well studied in the solution phase, and several attempts have been made to encode well&#8208;defined molecular architectures into solid&#8208;state polymeric materials. However, only limited studies have explored their potential in the solid state, where their lack of robustness and less ordered networks significantly hinder practical applications. Herein, we report the synthesis of a single&#8208;crystal cage framework and a systematic study of its host&#8208;guest chemistry, spanning from the solution state to the solid state. Our studies reveal that the host&#8208;guest interactions inherent to the cage are successfully maintained in the solid&#8208;state polymeric material. Furthermore, the framework's robustness allows for the guest molecules (fullerene) to be released triggered by an organic acid (trifluoracetic acid), with subsequent regeneration of the framework through an organic base (triethylamine) treatment. Our findings represent the first synthesis of a robust, single&#8208;crystal cage framework exhibiting highly selective and reversible host&#8208;guest chemistry, thus showing great potential towards molecular separation application.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Fe&#8208;Cu Dual&#8208;Metal Sites Synergistically Boost Carbonylation of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The production of acetic acid, an important industrial chemical traditionally obtained through the carbonylation of methanol using noble metal&#8208;based homogeneous catalysts, encounters challenges arising from high equipment costs and sustainability concerns. The direct liquid&#8208;phase oxidative carbonylation of methane emerges as a promising alternative, capitalizing on abundant natural gas resources and featuring a potentially mild and straightforward process. However, most catalysts proposed for this process suffer from low acetic acid yields due to the scarcity of active sites and the swift generation of C1 oxygenates, posing difficulties for subsequent carbonylation and impeding their industrial feasibility. Herein, we report a highly efficient 0.1Cu/Fe&#8208;HZ5&#8208;TF catalyst featuring exclusively mononuclear Fe and Cu anchored in the ZSM&#8208;5 channels. Under optimized conditions, the catalyst achieved an unprecedented acetic acid yield of 40.5 mmol gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 at 50 &#176;C, surpassing the previous maximum (12.0 mmol gcat&#8208;1h&#8208;1) by more than threefold. Comprehensive characterization, isotope&#8208;labeled experiments and DFT calculations reveal that the homogeneous mononuclear Fe sites are responsible for the activation and oxidation of methane, while the neighboring Cu sites play a key role in retarding the oxidation process. This synergistic action promotes C&#8208;C coupling, resulting in the efficient synthesis of acetic acid.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Selective Photocatalytic Synthesis of Acetic Acid at 0&#8208;25oC</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract
Acetic acid (AA), a vital compound in chemical production and materials manufacturing, is conventionally synthesized by starting with coal or methane through multiple steps including high&#8208;temperature transformations. Here we present a new synthesis of AA from ethane through photocatalytic selective oxidation of ethane by H2O2 at 0&#8208;25&#176;C. The catalyst designed for this process comprises g&#8208;C3N4 with anchored Pd1 single&#8208;atom sites. In&#8208;situ studies and computational simulation suggest the immobilized Pd1 atom becomes positively charged under photocatalytic condition. Under photoirradiation, the holes on the Pd1 single&#8208;atom of OH&#8208;Pd1&#197;/g&#8208;C3N4 serves as a catalytic site for activating a C&#8208;H instead of C&#8208;C of C2H6 with a low activation barrier of 0.14 eV, through a concerted mechanism. Remarkably, the selectivity for synthesizing AA reaches 98.7%, achieved under atmospheric pressure of ethane at 0&#176;C. By integrating photocatalysis with thermal catalysis, we introduce a highly selective, environmentally friendly, energy&#8208;efficient synthetic route for AA, starting from ethane, presenting a promising alternative for AA synthesis. This integration of photocatalysis in low&#8208;temperature oxidation demonstrates a new route of selective oxidation of light alkanes.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Abstract
Acetic acid (AA), a vital compound in chemical production and materials manufacturing, is conventionally synthesized by starting with coal or methane through multiple steps including high-temperature transformations. Here we present a new synthesis of AA from ethane through photocatalytic selective oxidation of ethane by H2O2 at 0-25&#176;C. The catalyst designed for this process comprises g-C3N4 with anchored Pd1 single-atom sites. In-situ studies and computational simulation suggest the immobilized Pd1 atom becomes positively charged under photocatalytic condition. Under photoirradiation, the holes on the Pd1 single-atom of OH-Pd1&#197;/g-C3N4 serves as a catalytic site for activating a C-H instead of C-C of C2H6 with a low activation barrier of 0.14 eV, through a concerted mechanism. Remarkably, the selectivity for synthesizing AA reaches 98.7%, achieved under atmospheric pressure of ethane at 0&#176;C. By integrating photocatalysis with thermal catalysis, we introduce a highly selective, environmentally friendly, energy-efficient synthetic route for AA, starting from ethane, presenting a promising alternative for AA synthesis.

         <dc:description>The commercialization of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li batteries (ASSLBs) demands solid electrolytes with strong cost&#8208;competitiveness, low density (for enabling satisfactory energy densities), and decent anode compatibility (the need for cathode compatibility can be circumvented by the cathode coating techniques that are widely applied in sulfide&#8208;based ASSLBs). However, none of the reported oxide, sulfide, or chloride solid electrolytes meets these requirements simultaneously. Here, we design a Li7P3S7.5O3.5 (LPSO) solid electrolyte, which shows a combination of all the aforementioned characteristics. The synthesis of this material does not need the expensive Li2S, so the raw materials cost is only $14.42/kg, which, unlike most solid electrolytes, lies below the $50/kg threshold for commercialization. The density of LPSO is&#160;1.70 g cm&#8208;3, considerably lower than those of the oxide (typically above 5 g cm&#8208;3) and chloride (around 2.5 g cm&#8208;3) solid electrolytes. Besides, LPSO also shows excellent anode compatibility. The Li | LPSO | Li cell cycles stably with a potential of ~50 mV under 0.1 mA cm&#8208;2 for over 4200 h at 25 &#176;C, and the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cell with the Si anode shows a capacity retention of 89.29% after 200 cycles under 88.6 mA g&#8208;1 at 60 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>A Conductive Binder Based on Mesoscopic Interpenetration with Polysulfides Capturing Skeleton and Redox Intermediates Network for Lithium Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The practical application of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries with high theoretical energy density and readily available cathode active materials is hampered by problems such as sulfur insulation, dramatic volume changes, and polysulfide shuttling. The targeted development of novel binders is the most industrialized solution to the problem of sulfur cathodes. Herein, an aqueous conductive emulsion binder with the sulfonate&#8208;containing hard elastic copolymer core and the conjugate polymer shell, which is capable of forming a bicontinuous mesoscopic interpenetrating polymer network, is synthesized and investigated. Not only can the elastic skeleton formed by the copolymer bind the active substance under drastic volume changes, but also the rich ester and cyanide groups in it can effectively capture lithium polysulfide. Meanwhile, the conducting skeleton consisting of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) both provides the additional charge conduction pathways and acts as the redox intermediates, significantly accelerating the kinetic process of lithium polysulfide conversion. Based on the synergistic effect of the above mechanisms, the use of the prepared binder on the sulfur carbon cathode significantly improves the rate performance and cycle stability of lithium sulfur batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Analysis of Interfacial Morphological and Chemical Evolution in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visualizing lithium (Li) ions and understanding Li plating/stripping processes as well as evolution of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) are critical for optimizing all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries (ASSLMB). However, the buried solid&#8208;solid interfaces present a challenge for detection which preclude the employment of multiple analysis techniques. Herein, by employing complementary in situ characterizations, morphological/chemical evolution, Li plating/stripping dynamics and SEI dynamics were efficiently decoupled and Li ion behavior at interface between different solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSE) was successfully detected. The innovative combining experiments of in situ atomic force microscopy and in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy on Li metal anode revealed interfacial morphological/chemical evolution and decoupled Li plating/stripping process from SEI evolution. Though Li plating speed in Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS) was higher than Li3PS4 (LPS), speed of SSE decomposition was similar and ~85% interfacial SSE turned into SEI during plating and remained unchanged in stripping. To leverage strengths of different SSEs, an LPS&#8208;LGPS&#8208;LPS sandwich electrolyte was developed, demonstrating enhanced ionic conductivity and improved interfacial stability with less SSE decomposition (25%). Using in situ Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy, Li&#8208;ion behavior at interface between different SSEs was effectively visualized, uncovering distribution of Li ions at LGPS|LPS interface under different potentials.</dc:description>

         <title>Are Redox&#8208;Active Centers Bridged by Saturated Flexible Linkers Systematically Electrochemically Independent?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemistry textbooks teach that the behavior of charged redox centers bound by saturated linkers is essentially governed by electrostatics. We show that for short alkanes and pyridiniums, as Coulombic and through&#8208;bond interactions become ineffective, reductive cyclomer formation is governed by London dispersion and &#963;&#8208;type overlap of 2pz atomic orbitals of the C&#947; atoms of electrophoric ends rather than by electron spin&#8208;spin interaction.







Abstract
The extent to which electrophores covalently bridged by a saturated linker are electrochemically independent was investigated considering the charge/spin duality of the electron and functionality of the electrophore as a spin carrier upon reduction. By combining computational modeling with electrochemical experiments, we investigated the mechanism by which tethered electrophores react together within 4,4&#8242;&#8208;oligo[n]methylene&#8208;bipyridinium assemblies (with n=2 to 5). We show that native dicationic electrophores (redox state Z=+2) are folded prior to electron injection into the system, allowing the emergence of supra&#8208;molecular orbitals (supra&#8208;MOs) likely to support the process of the reductive &#963; bond formation giving cyclomers. Indeed, for Z=+2, London Dispersion (LD) forces contribute to flatten the potential energy surface such that all&#8208;trans and folded conformers are approximately isoenergetic. Then, upon one&#8208;electron injection, for radical cations (Z=+1), LD forces significantly stabilize the folded conformers, except for the ethylene derivative deprived of supra&#8208;MOs. For radical cations equipped with supra&#8208;MOs, the unpaired electron is delocalized over both heterocycles through space. Cyclomer completion (Z=0) upon the second electron transfer occurs according to the inversion of redox potentials. This mechanism explains why intramolecular reactivity is favored and why pyridinium electrophores are not independent.

         <title>An Amphiphilic Cell&#8208;Penetrating Macrocycle for Efficient Cytosolic Delivery of Proteins, DNA, and CRISPR Cas9</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[+]	S.&#8197;Q. and I.&#8197;A.&#8197;B. contributed equally to this work.A cell penetrating macrocycle (CPM) with flexible amine linkages and amphiphilic nature assembles into a micellar&#8208;like structure that can passively permeate through the cell membrane. CPM can efficiently transfer fully functioning proteins and genetic materials into the cytosol, independent of size, charge, or complexity.







Abstract
The discovery of safe platforms that can circumvent the endocytic pathway is of great significance for biological therapeutics that are usually degraded during endocytosis. Here we show that a self&#8208;assembled and dynamic macrocycle can passively diffuse through the cell membrane and deliver a broad range of biologics, including proteins, CRISPR Cas9, and ssDNA, directly to the cytosol while retaining their bioactivity. Cell&#8208;penetrating macrocycle CPM can be easily prepared from the room temperature condensation of diketopyrrolopyrrole lactams with diamines. We attribute the high cellular permeability of CPM to its amphiphilic nature and chameleonic properties. It adopts conformations that partially bury polar groups and expose hydrophobic side chains, thus self&#8208;assembling into micellar&#8208;like structures. Its superior fluorescence makes CPM trackable inside cells where it follows the endomembrane system. CPM outperformed commercial reagents for biologics delivery and showed high RNA knockdown efficiency of CRISPR Cas9. We envisage that this macrocycle will be an ideal starting point to design and synthesize biomimetic macrocyclic tags that can readily facilitate the interaction and uptake of biomolecules and overcome endosomal digestion.

         <title>Transient Covalent Polymers through Carbodiimide&#8208;Driven Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transient covalent polymers generated by chemical fuel reactions should serve as useful model systems for nonequilibrium assembly. Here, aqueous poly(anhydrides) have been generated by treatment of dicarboxylic acid monomers with carbodiimides. Molecular weights over 15,000 have been achieved, with polymer lifetimes on the order of hours to weeks. The effect of solvent, reactant concentrations, and temperature has been examined.







Abstract
Biochemical systems make use of out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium polymers generated under kinetic control. Inspired by these systems, many abiotic supramolecular polymers driven by chemical fuel reactions have been reported. Conversely, polymers based on transient covalent bonds have received little attention, even though they have the potential to complement supramolecular systems by generating transient structures based on stronger bonds and by offering a straightforward tuning of reaction kinetics. In this study, we show that simple aqueous dicarboxylic acids give poly(anhydrides) when treated with the carbodiimide EDC. Transient covalent polymers with molecular weights exceeding 15,000 are generated which then decompose over the course of hours to weeks. Disassembly kinetics can be controlled using simple substituent effects in the monomer design. The impact of solvent polarity, carbodiimide concentration, temperature, pyridine concentration, and monomer concentration on polymer properties and lifetimes has been investigated.

&lt;p&gt;Transient covalent polymers generated by chemical fuel reactions should serve as useful model systems for nonequilibrium assembly. Here, aqueous poly(anhydrides) have been generated by treatment of dicarboxylic acid monomers with carbodiimides. Molecular weights over 15,000 have been achieved, with polymer lifetimes on the order of hours to weeks. The effect of solvent, reactant concentrations, and temperature has been examined.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biochemical systems make use of out-of-equilibrium polymers generated under kinetic control. Inspired by these systems, many abiotic supramolecular polymers driven by chemical fuel reactions have been reported. Conversely, polymers based on transient covalent bonds have received little attention, even though they have the potential to complement supramolecular systems by generating transient structures based on stronger bonds and by offering a straightforward tuning of reaction kinetics. In this study, we show that simple aqueous dicarboxylic acids give poly(anhydrides) when treated with the carbodiimide EDC. Transient covalent polymers with molecular weights exceeding 15,000 are generated which then decompose over the course of hours to weeks. Disassembly kinetics can be controlled using simple substituent effects in the monomer design. The impact of solvent polarity, carbodiimide concentration, temperature, pyridine concentration, and monomer concentration on polymer properties and lifetimes has been investigated. The results reveal substantial control over polymer assembly and disassembly kinetics, highlighting the potential for fine-tuned kinetic control in nonequilibrium polymerization systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A NIR&#8208;Light&#8208;Activated and Lysosomal&#8208;Targeted Pt(II) Metallacycle for Highly Potent Evoking of Immunogenic Cell Death that Potentiates Cancer Immunotherapy of Deep&#8208;Seated Tumors</title>

         <dc:description>
A platinum (Pt) metallacycle (1) is designed as the first example of a supramolecular near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;activated immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducer. 1 generates boosted reactive oxygen species excited by NIR light and induces lysosomal dysfunction thus synergistically augments immunomodulatory response with the effective dose of about a sixtieth compared with oxaliplatin and efficiently reduces adverse effects.







Abstract
Though platinum (Pt)&#8208;based complexes have been recently exploited as immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducers for activating immunotherapy, the effective activation of sufficient immune responses with minimal side effects in deep&#8208;seated tumors remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we propose the first example of a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;activated and lysosomal targeted Pt(II) metallacycle (1) as a supramolecular ICD inducer. 1 synergistically potentiates immunomodulatory response in deep&#8208;seated tumors via multiple&#8208;regulated approaches, involving NIR light excitation, boosted reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, good selectivity between normal and tumor cells, and enhanced tumor penetration/retention capabilities. Specifically, 1 has excellent depth&#8208;activated ROS production (~7&#8197;mm), accompanied by strong anti&#8208;diffusion and anti&#8208;ROS quenching ability. In vitro experiments demonstrate that 1 exhibits significant cellular uptake and ROS generation in tumor cells as well as respective multicellular tumor spheroids. Based on these advantages, 1 induces a more efficient ICD in an ultralow dose (i.e., 5&#8197;&#956;M) compared with the clinical ICD inducer&#8208;oxaliplatin (300&#8197;&#956;M). In vivo, vaccination experiments further demonstrate that 1 serves as a potent ICD inducer through eliciting CD8+/CD4+ T&#8197;cell response and Foxp3+ T&#8197;cell depletion with negligible adverse effects. This study pioneers a promising avenue for safe and effective metal&#8208;based ICD agents in immunotherapy.

         <dc:description>
The Rh&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective &#948;&#8208;arylation of aryl 1,3&#8208;dienes is reported, giving Z&#8208;alkene products in &gt;95&#8201;% ee and &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 Z&#8201;:&#8201;E. Protonolysis of a Rh&#8208;allyl intermediate generated by diene insertion into a Rh&#8208;aryl is likely the slow step and occurs by an inner&#8208;sphere proton transfer with MeOH.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective conjugate arylations of electron&#8208;poor alkenes are highly selective processes for C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation. &#948;&#8208;Selective hydroarylations of electron&#8208;poor 1,3&#8208;dienes are less well developed and reactions that deliver high enantioselectivity while giving single alkene isomer products are elusive. Here we report the Rh&#8208;catalyzed &#948;&#8208;arylation of aryl&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;dienes that gives nearly exclusive Z&#8208;1,4&#8208;addition products (generally with &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 positional and geometrical selectivity). This remote functionalization provides access to chiral diarylated alkenes from readily available precursors poised for further functionalization, including in the synthesis of bioactive molecules. Mechanistic studies suggest that protonolysis of a Rh&#8208;allyl intermediate generated by diene insertion into a Rh&#8208;aryl is the turnover limiting step and occurs by an inner&#8208;sphere proton transfer pathway.

         <title>Solar Azo&#8208;Switches for Effective E&#8594;Z Photoisomerization by Sunlight</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sunlight&#8208;induced isomerization of azo&#8208;switches is realized through spectral reshaping. Our sunlight&#8208;driven azo&#8208;switches absorb across a broad ultraviolet to visible spectrum and achieve 80&#8211;90&#8201;% E&#8594;Z isomerization yields under unfiltered sunlight. Solar switches hold great potential for sustainable light&#8208;driven systems and efficient solar energy utilization for applications such as molecular machines, actuators, and molecular solar thermal storage.







Abstract
Natural photoactive systems have evolved to harness broad&#8208;spectrum light from solar radiation for critical functions such as light perception and photosynthetic energy conversion. Molecular photoswitches, which undergo structural changes upon light absorption, are artificial photoactive tools widely used for developing photoresponsive systems and converting light energy. However, photoswitches generally need to be activated by light of specific narrow wavelength ranges for effective photoconversion, which limits their ability to directly work under sunlight and to efficiently harvest solar energy. Here, focusing on azo&#8208;switches&#8212;the most extensively studied photoswitches, we demonstrate effective solar E&#8594;Z photoisomerization with photoconversions exceeding 80&#8201;% under unfiltered sunlight. These sunlight&#8208;driven azo&#8208;switches are developed by rendering the absorption of E isomers overwhelmingly stronger than that of Z isomers across a broad ultraviolet to visible spectrum. This unusual type of spectral profile is realized by a simple yet highly adjustable molecular design strategy, enabling the fine&#8208;tuning of spectral window that extends light absorption beyond 600&#8197;nm. Notably, back&#8208;photoconversion can be achieved without impairing the forward solar isomerization, resulting in unique light&#8208;reversible solar switches. Such exceptional solar chemistry of photoswitches provides unprecedented opportunities for developing sustainable light&#8208;driven systems and efficient solar energy technologies.

         <title>Engineering Low Volume Resuscitants for the Prehospital Care of Severe Hemorrhagic Shock</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traumatic injury is a leading cause of global suffering and death. We rationally design polymeric, low volume resuscitants (LVRs) for the prehospital treatment of severe hemorrhagic shock. By varying polymer architecture, Rg, and composition to influence resuscitation, coagulation, and biodistribution, we developed a radiant star polymer that is non&#8208;coagulopathic and corrects 60&#8201;% total blood volume (TBV) loss when given at only 10&#8201;% TBV. This highly portable LVR has profound potential for application in trauma medicine.







Abstract
Globally, traumatic injury is a leading cause of suffering and death. The ability to curtail damage and ensure survival after major injury requires a time&#8208;sensitive response balancing organ perfusion, blood loss, and portability, underscoring the need for novel therapies for the prehospital environment. Currently, there are few options available for damage control resuscitation (DCR) of trauma victims. We hypothesize that synthetic polymers, which are tunable, portable, and stable under austere conditions, can be developed as effective injectable therapies for trauma medicine. In this work, we design injectable polymers for use as low volume resuscitants (LVRs). Using RAFT polymerization, we evaluate the effect of polymer size, architecture, and chemical composition upon both blood coagulation and resuscitation in a rat hemorrhagic shock model. Our therapy is evaluated against a clinically used colloid resuscitant, Hextend. We demonstrate that a radiant star poly(glycerol monomethacrylate) polymer did not interfere with coagulation while successfully correcting metabolic deficit and resuscitating animals from hemorrhagic shock to the desired mean arterial pressure range for DCR &#8211; correcting a 60&#8201;% total blood volume (TBV) loss when given at only 10&#8201;% TBV. This highly portable and non&#8208;coagulopathic resuscitant has profound potential for application in trauma medicine.

         <title>Photoinitiated Transient Self&#8208;Assembly in a Catalytically Driven Chemical Reaction Cycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show a catalytically&#8208;driven chemical reaction network (CRN) photoinitiated with 450&#8197;nm light. By combining photoredox and organometallic catalysis relying on pre&#8208;fuel hydrolysis to release deactivating fuel, we can control the formation of transient supramolecular fibers. Irradiation with 305&#8197;nm light accelerates the release of deactivating fuel, leading to faster deactivation of the monomer. Overall, we show transient self&#8208;assembly upon visible light activation, and tunable life&#8208;times by ultraviolet light.







Abstract
Chemically fueled chemical reaction networks (CRNs) are essential in controlling dissipative self&#8208;assembly. A key challenge in the field is to store chemical fuel&#8208;precursors or &#8220;pre&#8208;fuels&#8221; in the system that are converted into activating or deactivating fuels in a catalytically controlled CRN. In addition, real&#8208;time control over catalysis in a CRN by light is highly desirable, but so far not yet achieved. Here we show a catalytically driven CRN that is photoinitiated with 450&#8197;nm light, producing activated monomers that go on to perform transient self&#8208;assembly. Monomer activation proceeds via photoredox catalysis, converting the monomer alcohol groups into the corresponding aldehydes that self&#8208;assemble into large supramolecular fibers. Monomer deactivation is achieved by organometallic catalysis that relies on pre&#8208;fuel hydrolysis to release formate (i.e. the deactivating fuel). Additionally, irradiation with 305&#8197;nm light accelerates the release of formate by photo&#8208;uncaging the pre&#8208;fuel, leading to a factor of ca. 2 faster deactivation of the monomer. Overall, we show transient self&#8208;assembly upon visible light photoactivation, and tunable life&#8208;times by ultraviolet light.

         <title>Surfactant Directionally Assembled at the Electrode&#8208;Electrolyte Interface for Facilitating Electrocatalytic Aldehyde Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quaternary ammonium cationic surfactant&#8208;modified electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces have been designed for cathodic catalytic conversion of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)furan. Under the application potential conditions, the surfactant undergoes a conformational transition from random distribution to directional assembly. This microenvironmental regulation strategy achieves efficient hydrogenation of HMF and inhibits hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols is a promising alternative to conventional thermal processes. Both the catalyst and electrolyte deeply impact the performance. Designing the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface remains challenging due to its compositional and structural complexity. Here, we employ the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) as a reaction model. The typical cationic surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), and its analogs are employed as electrolyte additives to tune the interfacial microenvironment, delivering high&#8208;efficiency hydrogenation of HMF and inhibition of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The surfactants experience a conformational transformation from stochastic distribution to directional assembly under applied potential. This oriented arrangement hampers the transfer of water molecules to the interface and promotes the enrichment of reactants. In addition, near 100&#8201;% 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF) selectivity is achieved, and the faradaic efficiency (FE) of the BHMF is improved from 61&#8201;% to 74&#8201;% at &#8722;100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Notably, the microenvironmental modulation strategy applies to a range of electrocatalytic hydrogenation reactions involving aldehyde substrates. This work paves the way for engineering advanced electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces and boosting unsaturated alcohol electrosynthesis efficiency.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Induced Interstitial Effects Drive Water Oxidation on Ordered Ir&#8722;B Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The B&#8208;induced interstitial effects in intermetallic IrB1.1 balance the acidic water oxidation activity and stability and leads to a good operation in proton&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolyzers.







Abstract
Interstitial filling of light atoms strongly affects the electronic structure and adsorption properties of the parent catalyst due to ligand and ensemble effects. Different from the conventional doping and surface modification, constructing ordered intermetallic structures is more promising to overcome the dissolution and reconstruction of active sites through strong interactions generated by atomic periodic arrangement, achieving joint improvement in catalytic activity and stability. However, for tightly arranged metal lattices, such as iridium (Ir), obtaining ordered filling atoms and further unveiling their interstitial effects are still limited by highly activated processes. Herein, we report a high&#8208;temperature molten salt assisted strategy to form the intermetallic Ir&#8722;B compounds (IrB1.1) with ordered filling by light boron (B) atoms. The B residing in the interstitial lattice of Ir constitutes favorable adsorption surfaces through a donor&#8208;acceptor architecture, which has an optimal free energy uphill in rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), resulting in enhanced activity. Meanwhile, the strong coupling of Ir&#8722;B structural units suppresses the demetallation and reconstruction behavior of Ir, ensuring catalytic stability. Such B&#8208;induced interstitial effects endow IrB1.1 with higher OER performance than commercial IrO2, which is further validated in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs).

         <title>Spirobifluorene Trimers: High Triplet Pure Hydrocarbon Hosts for Highly Efficient Blue Phosphorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of extended pure hydrocarbon (PHC) materials with a high triplet energy, a wide HOMO/LUMO gap and improved thermal properties compared to reported PHCs have been constructed by the assembly of three spirobifluorene fragments. When used as the host in blue phosphorescent OLEDs (PhOLEDs), a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 24&#8201;% with a low&#8208;efficiency roll&#8208;off was reached.







Abstract
Pure aromatic hydrocarbon materials (PHCs) represent a new generation of host materials for phosphorescent OLEDs (PhOLEDs), free of heteroatoms. They reduce the molecular complexity, can be easily synthesized and are an important direction towards robust devices. As heteroatoms can be involved in bonds dissociations in operating OLEDs through exciton induced degradation processes, developing novel PHCs appear particularly relevant for the future of this technology. In the present work, we report a series of extended PHCs constructed by the assembly of three spirobifluorene fragments. The resulting positional isomers present a high triplet energy level, a wide HOMO/LUMO difference and improved thermal and morphological properties compared to previously reported PHCs. These characteristics are beneficial for the next generation of host materials for PhOLEDs and provide relevant design guidelines. When used as a host in blue&#8208;emitting PhOLEDs, which are still the weakest link of the field, a very high EQE of 24&#8201;% and low threshold voltage of 3.56&#8197;V were obtained with a low&#8208;efficiency roll&#8208;off. This high performance strengthens the position of PHC strategy as an efficient alternative for OLED technology and opens the way to a more simple electronic.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Arylative Cope Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported herein is the arylative Cope rearrangement of 1,6&#8208;heptadienes facilitated by ligand&#8208;enabled redox gold catalysis. Unlike the classical Cope rearrangement involving 1,5&#8208;hexadienes, a cyclization&#8208;induced [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement of 1,6&#8208;heptadienes using the merger of &#960;&#8208;activation and cross&#8208;coupling reactivity, has been achieved.







Abstract
Cope rearrangements have garnered significant attention owing to their ability to undergo structural reorganization in stereoselective manner. While substantial advances have been achieved over decades, these rearrangements remained applicable exclusively to parent 1,5&#8208;hexadienes. Herein, we disclose the gold&#8208;catalyzed arylative Cope rearrangement of 1,6&#8208;heptadienes via a cyclization&#8208;induced [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement employing ligand&#8208;enabled gold redox catalysis. Detailed mechanistic investigations including several control experiments, cross&#8208;over experiment, HRMS analysis, 31P&#8197;NMR and DFT studies have been performed to underpin the mechanism.

         <title>Enhanced Electron Delocalization Induced by Ferromagnetic Sulfur doped C3N4 Triggers Selective H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur&#8208;doped defect&#8208;rich graphitic carbon nitride (S&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4) catalyst causes the in&#8208;plane electronic perturbations, further inducing stronger electron delocalization state on carbon sites, which breaks the *C&#8722;O bond and involves the faster desorption of the key reaction intermediate *OOH on the metal surface to form the final product H2O2.







Abstract
For the 2D metal&#8208;free carbon catalysts, the atomic coplanar architecture enables a large number of pz orbitals to overlap laterally, thus forming &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, and the delocalization degree of the central atom dominates the catalytic activity. Herein, designing sulfur&#8208;doped defect&#8208;rich graphitic carbon nitride (S&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4) materials as a model, we propose a strategy to promote localized electron polarization by enhancing the ferromagnetism of ultra&#8208;thin 2D carbon nitride nanosheets. The introduction of sulfur (S) further promotes localized ferromagnetic coupling, thereby inducing long&#8208;range ferromagnetic ordering and accelerating the electron interface transport. Meanwhile, the hybridization of sulfur atoms breaks the symmetry and integrity of the unit structure, promotes electron enrichment and stimulating electron delocalization at the active site. This optimization enhances the *OOH desorption, providing a favorable kinetic pathway for the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Consequently, S&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4 exhibits high selectivity (&gt;95&#8201;%) and achieves a superb H2O2 production rate, approaching 4374.8&#8197;ppm during continuous electrolysis over 300&#8197;hour. According to theoretical calculation and in situ spectroscopy, the ortho&#8208;S configuration can provide ferromagnetic perturbation in carbon active centers, leading to the electron delocalization, which optimizes the OOH* adsorption during the catalytic process.

         <title>A Cyclometalated Ruthenium(II) Complex Induces Oncosis for Synergistic Activation of Innate and Adaptive Immunity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nucleus and mitochondria dual&#8208;localized ruthenium(II) complex disrupts DNA to activate PARP1 protein combined with ATP consumption and produces mitochondrial oxidative stress, triggering porimin and Calpain&#8197;1 protein to induce cell oncosis and boosting innate and adaptive immunity.







Abstract
An optimal cancer chemotherapy regimen should effectively address the drug resistance of tumors while eliciting antitumor&#8208;immune responses. Research has shown that non&#8208;apoptotic cell death, such as pyroptosis and ferroptosis, can enhance the immune response. Despite this, there has been limited investigation and reporting on the mechanisms of oncosis and its correlation with immune response. Herein, we designed and synthesized a Ru(II) complex that targeted the nucleus and mitochondria to induce cell oncosis. Briefly, the Ru(II) complex disrupts the nucleus and mitochondria DNA, which active polyADP&#8208;ribose polymerase&#8197;1, accompanied by ATP consumption and porimin activation. Concurrently, mitochondrial damage and endoplasmic reticulum stress result in the release of Ca2+ ions and increased expression of Calpain&#8197;1. Subsequently, specific pore proteins porimin and Calpain&#8197;1 promote cristae destruction or vacuolation, ultimately leading to cell membrane rupture. The analysis of RNA sequencing demonstrates that the Ru(II) complex can initiate the oncosis&#8208;associated pathway and activate both innate and adaptive immunity. In vivo experiments have confirmed that oncosis promotes dendritic cell maturation and awakens adaptive cytotoxic T lymphocytes but also activates the innate immune by inducing the polarization of macrophages towards an M1 phenotype.

         <title>A Rationally Designed Iron(II) Catalyst for C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) and C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>

         <dc:description>
A well&#8208;defined iron catalyst with high efficiency for Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling involving C(sp3) partners is described. In the presence of a lithium amide base, this catalyst enabled, for the first time, C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) coupling of 1&#176;, 2&#176;, and 3&#176; alkyl halides and (hetero)aryl boronic esters as well as C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) coupling of 1&#176; and 2&#176; alkyl halides and 1&#176; and 2&#176; alkyl boranes under mild conditions and with broad functional group tolerance.







Abstract
Despite the paramount importance of the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling (SMC) in academia and industry, and the great promise of iron to offer sustainable catalysis, iron&#8208;catalyzed SMC involving sp3&#8208;hybridized partners is still in its infancy. We herein report the development of a versatile, well&#8208;defined electron&#8208;deficient anilido&#8208;aldimine iron(II) catalyst. This catalyst effectively performed C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) and C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) SMC of alkyl halide electrophiles and (hetero)aryl boronic ester and alkyl borane nucleophiles respectively, in the presence of a lithium amide base. These couplings operated under mild reaction conditions and displayed wide functional group compatibility including various medicinally relevant N&#8208;, O&#8208; and S&#8208;based heterocycles. They also tolerated primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl halides (Br, Cl, I), electron&#8208;neutral, &#8208;rich and &#8208;poor boronic esters and primary and secondary alkyl boranes. Our methodology could be directly and efficiently applied to synthesize key intermediates relevant to pharmaceuticals and a potential drug candidate. For C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) couplings, radical probe experiments militated in favor of a carbon&#8208;centered radical derived from the electrophile. At the same time, reactions run with a pre&#8208;formed activated boron nucleophile coupled to competition experiments supported the involvement of neutral, rather than an anionic, (hetero)aryl boronic ester in the key transmetalation step.

         <title>Facile Access to Organostibines via Selective Organic Superbase Catalyzed Antimony&#8208;Carbon Protonolysis</title>

C6F5, the perfect leaving group for highly selective antimony&#8208;carbon bond formation reactions via organosuperbase&#8208;catalysis! This novel approach enables mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted perfluorophenyl stibines to be smoothly converted to a range of synthetically useful aromatic, heteroaromatic and alkynyl&#8208;substituted stibines under metal&#8208; and salt&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
The selective formation of antimony&#8208;carbon bonds via organic superbase catalysis under metal&#8208; and salt&#8208;free conditions is reported. This novel approach utilizes electron&#8208;deficient stibine, Sb(C6F5)3, to give upon base&#8208;catalyzed reactions with weakly acidic aromatic and heteroaromatic hydrocarbons access to a range of new aromatic and heteroaromatic stibines, respectively, with loss of C6HF5. Also, the significantly less electron&#8208;deficient stibines, Ph2SbC6F5 and PhSb(C6F5)2 smoothly underwent base&#8208;catalyzed exchange reactions with a range of terminal alkynes to generate the stibines of formulae PhSb(C&#8801;CPh)2, and Ph2SbC&#8801;CR [R=C6H5, C6H4&#8208;NO2, COOEt, CH2Cl, CH2NEt2, CH2OSiMe3, Sb(C6H5)2], respectively. These formal substitution reactions proceed with high selectivity as only the C6F5 groups serve as a leaving group to be liberated as C6HF5 upon formal proton transfer from the alkyne. Kinetic studies of the base&#8208;catalyzed reaction of Ph2SbC6F5 with phenyl acetylene to form Ph2SbC&#8801;CPh and C6HF5 suggested the empirical rate law to exhibit a first&#8208;order dependence with respect to the base catalyst, alkyne and stibine. DFT calculations support a pathway proceeding via a concerted &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis transition state, where the base catalyst activates the Sb&#8208;C6F5 bond sequence through secondary bond interactions.

         <title>Catalytic (4+2) Annulation via Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Interception of in&#8208;situ Generated Alkylgold Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective (4+2) annulation of N&#8208;propargylamides and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated imines/ketones has been accomplished under gold&#8208;complex and chiral quinine&#8208;derived squaramide synergetic catalysis, providing chiral tetrahydropyridines/dihydropyrans with high efficiency and selectivity. This method complements the (4+2) annulation of allene reagents via a formal cycloaddition on internal &#960;&#8208;bond, which is challenging and remains elusive.







Abstract
A regio&#8208; and stereoselective stepwise (4+2) annulation of N&#8208;propargylamides and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated imines/ketones has been accomplished with synergetic catalysis by a combination of a gold&#8208;complex and a chiral quinine&#8208;derived squaramide (QN&#8208;SQA), leading to highly functionalized chiral tetrahydropyridines/dihydropyrans in good to high yields with generally excellent enantioselectivity. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations indicate that the in situ formed alkylgold species is the key intermediate in this transformation, and the amide group served as a traceless directing group in this highly selective transformation. This method complements the enantioselective (4+2) annulation of allene reagents, providing the formal internal C&#8722;C &#960;&#8208;bond cycloaddition products, which is challenging and remains elusive.

         <title>An Alkyne&#8208;Bridged Covalent Organic Framework Featuring Interactive Pockets for Bromine Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bromine, a useful, although toxic halogen can coexist with I2 in an equilibrium product of IBr. Here, we propose a new Covalent Organic Framework (COF) featuring triple bonds, an electron&#8208;rich pyrene unit, and heteroatoms (N sites) to selectively capture Br2 over I2. The participation of the triple bond can be classified as a combined physisorption as well as chemisorption process, giving rise to a unique method for the capture of Br2.







Abstract
The high degree of corrosivity and reactivity of bromine, which is released from various sources, poses a serious threat to the environment. Moreover, its coexistence with iodine forming an equilibrium compound, iodine monobromide (IBr) necessitates the selective capture of bromine from halogen mixtures. The electrophilicity of halogens to &#960;&#8208;electron rich structures enabled us to strategically design a covalent organic framework for halogen capture, featuring a defined pore environment with localized sorption sites. The higher capture capacity of bromine (4.6&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1) over iodine by ~41&#8201;% shows its potential in selective capture. Spectroscopic results uncovering the preferential interaction sites are supported by theoretical investigations. The alkyne bridge is a core functionality promoting the selectivity in capture by synergistic physisorption, rationalized by the higher orbital overlap of bromine due to its smaller atomic size as well as reversible chemical interactions. The slip stacking in the structure has further promoted this phenomenon by creating clusters of molecular interaction sites with bromine intercalated between the layers. The inclusion of unsaturated moieties, i.e. triple bonds and the complementary pore geometry offer a promising design strategy for the construction of porous materials for halogen capture.

         <title>Anomalous Structural Transformation of Cu(I) Clusters into Multifunctional CuAg Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a doping&#8208;induced, anomalous structural transformation in Cu nanoclusters and uncovered its capability to create different types of alloy nanoclusters with previously unreported structures, properties and functionalities.







Abstract
We report an anomalous structural transformation of a Cu(I) cluster into two different types of copper&#8208;silver (CuAg) alloy nanoclusters. Different from previous reports, we demonstrate that under specifically designed reaction conditions, the Ag&#8208;doping could induce a substantial growth of the starting Cu15 and a Ag13Cu20 nanocluster was obtained via the unexpected insertion of an Ag13 kernel inside the Cu(I)&#8208;S shell. Ag13Cu20 demonstrates high activity to initiate the photopolymerization of previously hard&#8208;to&#8208;print inorganic polymers in 3D laser microprinting. Interestingly, a slight modification of the reaction condition leads to the formation of another Ag18&#8208;xCuxS (8&#8804;x) nanocluster templated by a central S2&#8722; anion, which possesses a unique electronic structure compared to conventional template&#8208;free CuAg nanoclusters. Overall, this work unveils the intriguing doping chemistry of Cu clusters, as well as their capability to create different types of alloy nanoclusters with previously unobtainable structures and multifunctionality.

         <title>Cu1&#8722;Fe Dual Sites for Superior Neutral Ammonia Electrosynthesis from Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom Cu is anchored on the oxide layer of Fe@Cu1FeOx to form Cu1&#8208;Fe dual&#8208;sites. The synergistic effect of enhanced NO3&#8722; adsorption on Fe sites and the strengthened water activation on Cu sites decreases the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of *NO hydrogenation, resulting in superior electroreduction of nitrate to ammonia.







Abstract
The electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is able to convert nitrate (NO3&#8722;) into reusable ammonia (NH3), offering a green treatment and resource utilization strategy of nitrate wastewater and ammonia synthesis. The conversion of NO3&#8722; to NH3 undergoes water dissociation to generate active hydrogen atoms and nitrogen&#8208;containing intermediates hydrogenation tandemly. The two relay processes compete for the same active sites, especially under pH&#8208;neutral condition, resulting in the suboptimal efficiency and selectivity in the electrosynthesis of NH3 from NO3&#8722;. Herein, we constructed a Cu1&#8208;Fe dual&#8208;site catalyst by anchoring Cu single atoms on amorphous iron oxide shell of nanoscale zero&#8208;valent iron (nZVI) for the electrochemical NO3RR, achieving an impressive NO3&#8722; removal efficiency of 94.8&#8201;% and NH3 selectivity of 99.2&#8201;% under neutral pH and nitrate concentration of 50&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 NO3&#8722;&#8722;N conditions, greatly surpassing the performance of nZVI counterpart. This superior performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect of enhanced NO3&#8722; adsorption on Fe sites and strengthened water activation on single&#8208;atom Cu sites, decreasing the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of *NO&#8208;to&#8208;*NOH. This work develops a novel strategy of fabricating dual&#8208;site catalysts to enhance the electrosynthesis of NH3 from NO3&#8722;, and presents an environmentally sustainable approach for neutral nitrate wastewater treatment.

A series of bis&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes of iridium(III) connected by naphthalene&#8208;diimide (NDI) and perylene&#8208;diimide (PDI) units have been prepared to determine the nature and strength of the (Cl)lone&#8208;pair&#8208;&#960; interactions between the chloride ligands and the heterocycles of the NDI/PDI moieties. Analysis of this interaction revealed that its enthalpy lies in the 6&#8211;9&#8197;kcal/mol range.







Abstract
A series of naphthalene&#8208;diimide (NDI) and perylene&#8208;diimide (PDI) connected bis&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes of iridium(III) have been prepared and fully characterized. The analysis of their NMR spectroscopic features, together with their molecular structures show that these species display lone&#8208;pair&#8208;&#960; interactions between the chloride ligands of the Ir(III) complex and the heterocycles of the NDI/PDI moieties. The detection of this type of interaction in solution is due to the formation of two atropisomers, which are formed as a result of the restricted rotation about the Ir&#8722;Ccarbene bond imposed by the (Cl)lp&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction. Variable&#8208;temperature 1H NMR analysis allowed the determination of the strength of this non&#8208;covalent interaction, which lies between &#916;H=6.6 and 10&#8197;kcal/mol. The computational studies performed fully support the experimental findings.

&lt;p&gt;A series of bis-N-heterocyclic carbene complexes of iridium(III) connected by naphthalene-diimide (NDI) and perylene-diimide (PDI) units have been prepared to determine the nature and strength of the (Cl)lone-pair-&#960; interactions between the chloride ligands and the heterocycles of the NDI/PDI moieties. Analysis of this interaction revealed that its enthalpy lies in the 6&#8211;9&#8197;kcal/mol range.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;driven Hydrated Eutectic Electrolytes with Diverse Solvation Configurations for All&#8208;Temperature Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Batteries always encounter uncontrollable failure or performance decay under extreme temperature environments, which is largely limited by the properties of electrolytes. Herein, an entropy&#8208;driven hydrated eutectic electrolyte (HEE) with diverse solvation configurations is proposed to expand the operating temperature range of Zn&#8208;ion batteries. The HEE possesses over 40 types of Zn2+ solvation structure with uniform distribution, contributing to its much higher solvation configurational entropy compared to the conventional aqueous counterpart (only 6 types). These effectively promotes its anti&#8208;freezing ability under ultralow temperatures, with a high ionic conductivity of 0.42 mS cm&#8208;1 even at a low temperature of &#8208;40 &#176;C. Moreover, the entropy&#8208;driven property can simultaneously enhance the thermal stability under a high temperature over +140 &#176;C. Therefore, the HEE can enable full cells stably working over a wide temperature range of &#8208;40~+80 &#176;C, performing over 1500 cycles with 100% capacity retention at &#8208;40 &#176;C and 1000 cycles with ~72% capacity retention at +80 &#176;C. This inspiring concept of entropy&#8208;driven electrolyte with quantized solvation configurational entropy value has charming potential for designing future special batteries with excellent adaptability towards extreme temperature environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of an Organic Emitter Exhibiting Reverse Intersystem Crossing Faster than Intersystem Crossing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)&#8208;based organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), acceleration of reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) and suppression of intersystem crossing (ISC) are demanded to shorten a lifetime of triplet excitons. As a system realizing RISC faster than ISC, inverted singlet&#8208;triplet excited states (iST) with a negative energy difference (&#916;EST) between the lowest excited singlet and the lowest triplet states have been gathering much attention recently. Here, we have focused on an asymmetric hexa&#8208;azaphenalene (A6AP) core to obtain a new insight into iST. Based on A6AP, we have newly designed A6AP&#8208;Cz with the calculated &#916;EST of &#8722;44 meV. The experimental studies of a synthesized A6AP&#8208;Cz revealed that the lifetime of delayed fluorescence (&#964;DF) was only 54 ns, which was the shortest among all organic materials. The rate constant of RISC (kRISC = 1.9&#215;107 s&#8722;1) was greater than that of ISC (kISC = 1.0&#215;107 s&#8722;1). The negative &#916;EST of A6AP&#8208;Cz was experimentally confirmed from 1) the kRISC and kISC (&#8722;45 meV) and 2) the temperature&#8208;dependent &#964;DF. 3) The onsets of fluorescence and phosphorescence spectra at 77 K also supported the evidence of negative &#916;EST (&#8722;73 meV). This study demonstrated the potential of A6AP as an iST core for the first time.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Adaptive Synthesis of Non&#8208;Covalent Crosslinkers while Folding Single&#8208;Chain Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptide folding is a dynamic process driven by non&#8208;covalent cross&#8208;linking leading to functional nanostructures for essential biochemical activities. However, replicating this process in synthetic systems is challenging due to the difficulty in mimicking nature's real&#8208;time regulation of non&#8208;covalent crosslinking for single&#8208;chain polymer folding. Here, we address this by employing anionic dithiol building blocks to create macrocyclic disulfides as non&#8208;covalent crosslinkers that adapted to the folding process. Initially, small macrocycles facilitated a low degree folding of a polycation. Then, this preorganized structure catalysed the production of larger macrocycles that enhanced the folding conversely. The self&#8208;adaptive synthesis was verified through the encapsulation of an anticancer drug, showing an updated production distribution of non&#8208;covalent crosslinkers and maximizing drug&#8208;loading efficiency against drug&#8208;resistant cancer in vitro. Our research advances the understanding of molecular systems by exploring species evolution via the structural dynamics of polymer folding. Additionally, adaptive synthesis enables controlled, sequential folding of synthetic polymers, with the potential to mimic protein functions.</dc:description>

         <title>BioLindlar Catalyst: Ene&#8208;Reductase&#8208;Promoted Selective Bioreduction of Cyanoalkynes to Give (Z)&#8208;Cyanoalkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct synthesis of alkenes from alkynes usually requires the use of transition&#8208;metal catalysts. Unfortunately, efficient biocatalytic alternatives for this transformation have yet to be discovered. Herein, the selective bioreduction of electron&#8208;deficient alkynes to alkenes catalysed by ene&#8208;reductases (EREDs) is described. Alkynes bearing ketone, aldehyde, ester, and nitrile moieties have been effectively reduced with excellent conversions and stereoselectivities, observing clear trends for the E/Z ratios depending on the nature of the electron&#8208;withdrawing group. In the case of cyanoalkynes, (Z)&#8208;alkenes were obtained as the major product, and the reaction scope was expanded to a wide variety of aromatic substrates (up to &gt;99% conversion, and Z/E stereoselectivities of up to &gt;99/1). Other alkynes containing aldehyde, ketone, or ester functionalities also proved to be excellent substrates, and interestingly gave the corresponding (E)&#8208;alkenes. Preparative biotransformations were performed on a 0.4 mmol scale, producing the desired (Z)&#8208;cyanoalkenes with good to excellent isolated yields (63&#8208;97%). This novel reactivity has been rationalised through molecular docking by predicting the binding poses of key molecules in the ERED&#8208;pu&#8208;0006 active site.</dc:description>

         <title>Topology Control of Covalent Organic Frameworks with Interlaced Unsaturated 2D and Saturated 3D Units for Boosting Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modulating the electronic state of multicomponent covalent organic framework (COF) electrocatalysts is crucial for enhancing catalytic activity. However, the effect of dimensionality on their physicochemical functionalities is still lacking. Herein, we report an interlaced unsaturated 2D and saturated 3D strategy to develop multicomponent&#8208;regulated COFs with tunable gradient dimensionality for high selectivity and activity electrocatalysis. Compared with the two&#8208;component 2D and 3D model COFs, the 2D/3D framework interlaced COFs with locally irregular dimensions and electronic structures are more practical in optimizing the intrinsic electrode surface reaction and mass transfer. Remarkably, the unsaturated 2D&#8208;inserted 3D TAE&#8208;COF regulates the adsorption mode of OOH* species to supply a favorable dynamic pathway for the H2O2 process, thereby achieving an excellent production rate of 8.50 mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. Moreover, utilizing theoretical calculation and in situ ATR&#8208;FTIR experiment, we found that the central carbon atom of the tetraphenyl&#8208;based unit&#160;(site&#8208;1 and site&#8208;6) are potential active sites. This strategy of operating the adsorption ability of reactants with dimensionality&#8208;interconnected building blocks provides an idea for designing durable and efficient electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling Modular Click Chemistry Library through Sequential Ligations of Carboxylic Acids and Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;throughput synthesis and screening of chemical libraries play pivotal roles in drug discovery. Click chemistry has emerged as a powerful strategy for constructing highly modular chemical libraries. However, the development of new click reactions and unlocking  new click able building blocks remain exceedingly challenging. Here in , we describe a double&#8208;click strategy that enables the sequential ligation of widely available carboxylic acids and amines with fluorosulfuryl isocyanate (FSO  2  NCO) via a modular amidation/SuFEx process. This method provides facile access to chemical libraries of N&#8208;fluorosulfonyl amides (RCONHSO  2  F) and N&#8208;acylsulfamides (RCONHSO  2  NR &#180; R &#180;&#180; )  in near&#8208;quantitative yields  under simple and practical conditions. The robustness and efficiency of this double click strategy is showcased by the facile construction of chemical libraries in 96&#8208;well microtiter plates from a large number of carboxylic acids and amines. Preliminary biological activity screening reveals that some compound s &#160;exhibit  high antimicrobial activities against Gram&#8208;positive bacterium &#160;S. aureus&#160;and drug&#8208;resistant MRSA&#160;(MIC up to 6.25&#183;&#956;g mL&#8208;1).&#160;These results provide compelling evidence for the potential application of modular click chemistry library as an enabling technology in high&#8208;throughput medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction by Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Light (1200 nm) Irradiation and a Ruthenium&#8208;Intercalated NiAl&#8208;Layered Double Hydroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;driven photocatalytic CO2 reduction (NIR&#8208;CO2PR) holds tremendous promise for the production of valuable commodity chemicals and fuels. However, designing photocatalysts capable of reducing CO2 with low energy NIR photons remains challenging. Herein, a novel NIR&#8208;driven photocatalyst comprising an anionic Ru complex intercalated between NiAl&#8208;layered double hydroxide nanosheets (NiAl&#8208;Ru&#8208;LDH) is shown to deliver efficient CO2 photoreduction (0.887 &#956;mol h&#8722;1) with CO selectivity of 84.81% under 1200 nm illumination and excellent stability over 50 testing cycles. This remarkable performance results from the intercalated Ru complex lowering the LDH band gap (0.98 eV) via a compression&#8208;related charge redistribution phenomenon. Furthermore, transient absorption spectroscopy data verified light&#8208;induced electron transfer from the Ru complex towards the LDH sheets, increasing the availability of electrons to drive CO2PR. The presence of hydroxyl defects in the LDH sheets promotes the adsorption of CO2 molecules and lowers the energy barriers for NIR&#8208;CO2PR to CO. To our knowledge, this is one of the first reports of NIR&#8208;CO2PR at wavelengths up to 1200 nm in LDH&#8208;based photocatalyst systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiple Functional Bonds Integrated Interphases for Long Cycle Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have garnered significant interest as one of the most promising energy suppliers for power grid energy storage. However, the poor electrode/electrolyte interfacial stability leads to continual electrolyte decomposition and transition metal dissolution, resulting in rapid performance degradation of SIBs. In this work, we propose a strategy integrating multiple functional bonds to regulate electrode/electrolyte interphase by triple&#8208;coupling of succinonitrile (SN), sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6) and fluorinated ethylene carbonate (FEC). Theoretical calculation and experiment results show that the solvation structure of Na+ and ClO4&#8208; is effectively reconfigured by the solvated FEC, SN and PF6&#8208; in PC&#8208;based carbonate electrolyte. The newly developed electrolyte demonstrates increased Na+&#8208;FEC coordination, weakened interaction of Na+&#8208;PC and participation of SN and PF6&#8208; anions in solvation, resulting in the formation of a conformal interfacial layer comprising of sodium oxynitrides (NaNxOy), sodium fluoride (NaF) and phosphorus oxide compounds (NaPxOy). Consequently, a 3 Ah pouch full cell of hard carbon//NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 exhibits an excellent capacity retention of 90.4% after 1000 cycles. Detailed postmortem analysis of interface chemistry is further illustrated by multiple characterization methods. This study provides a new avenue for developing electrolyte formulations with multiple functional bonds integrated interphases to significantly improve the long&#8208;term cycling stability of SIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Two RNA Folds from One Sequence: A Ribozyme with Versatile Substrate Processing Abilities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the design of a single RNA sequence capable of adopting one of two ribozyme folds and catalyzing the cleavage and/or ligation of the respective substrates. The RNA is able to change its conformation in response to its environment, hence it is called chameleon ribozyme (CHR). Efficient RNA cleavage of two different substrates as well as RNA ligation by CHR is demonstrated in separate experiments and in a one pot reaction. Our study shows that sequence variants of the hairpin ribozyme intersect with the hammerhead ribozyme and that rather short RNA molecules can have comprehensive conformational flexibility, which is an important feature for the emergence of new functional folds in early evolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Edge&#8208;Rich Pt&#8208;O&#8208;Ce Sites in CeO2 Supported Patchy Atomic&#8208;Layer Pt Enable a Non&#8208;CO Pathway for Efficient Methanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational design of efficient methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) catalyst that undergo non&#8208;CO pathway is essential to resolve the long&#8208;standing poisoning issue. However, it remains a huge challenge due to the rather difficulty in maximizing the non&#8208;CO pathway by the selective coupling between the key *CHO and *OH intermediates. Here, we report a high&#8208;performance electrocatalyst of patchy atomic&#8208;layer Pt epitaxial growth on CeO2 nanocube (Pt ALs/CeO2) with maximum electron&#8208;metal support interactions for enhancing the coupling selectively. The small&#8208;size monolayer material achieves an optimal geometrical distance between edge Pt&#8208;O&#8208;Ce sites and *OH absorbed on CeO2, which well restrains the dehydrogenation of *CHO, resulting in the non&#8208;CO pathway. Meanwhile, the *CHO/*CO intermediate generated at inner Pt&#8208;O&#8208;Ce sites can migrate to edge, inducing the subsequent coupling reaction, thus avoiding poisoning while promoting reaction efficiency. Consequently, Pt ALs/CeO2 exhibits exceptionally catalytic stability with negligible degradation even under 1000 s pure CO poisoning operation and high mass activity (14.87 A/mgPt), enabling it one of the best&#8208;performing alkali&#8208;stable MOR catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>The Dependence of Solid Electrolyte Interphase on the Crystal Facet of Current Collector in Li Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The continuous electrolyte decomposition and uncontrolled dendrite growth caused by the unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) have largely hindered the development of Li metal batteries. Here, we demonstrate that tuning the facet of current collector can regulate the composition of SEI and the subsequent Li deposition behavior using single&#8208;crystal Cu foils as an ideal platform. The theoretical and experimental studies reveal that the (100) facet of Cu possesses strong adsorption to anions, guiding more anions to participate preferentially in the inner Helmholtz plane and further promoting the formation of the stable inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. Consequently, the single&#8208;crystal Cu foils with a single [100] orientation (s&#8208;Cu(100)) achieve the dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition with enhanced Li plating/stripping reversibility. Moreover, the Li anode deposited on s&#8208;Cu(100) can stabilize the operation of an Ah&#8208;level pouch cell (350 Wh kg&#8722;1) with a low negative/positive capacity ratio (~2) and lean electrolyte (2.4 g Ah&#8722;1) for 150 cycles. Impressively, this strategy demonstrates universality in a series of electrolytes employed different anions. This work provides new insights into the correlation between the SEI and current collector, opening a universal avenue towards high&#8208;performance Li metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Dual&#8208;Mode Efficient Tunable Afterglow via J&#8208;Aggregates in Single&#8208;Phosphor&#8208;Doped Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of polymer&#8208;based persistent luminescence materials with color&#8208;tunable organic afterglow and multiple responses is highly desirable for the applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, flexible displays and data&#8208;storage. However, achieving efficient persistent luminescence from a single&#8208;phosphor system with multiple responses remains a challenging task. Herein, a hierarchical dual&#8208;mode emission system is developed by doping 9H&#8208;pyrido[3,4&#8208;b]indole (PI2) into an amorphous polyacrylamide matrix, which exhibits color&#8208;tunable afterglow due to excitation&#8208;, temperature&#8208; and humidity&#8208;dependence. Notably, the coexistence of isolated state and J&#8208;aggregate state of the guest molecule not only provides excitation&#8208;dependent afterglow color, but also leads to hierarchical temperature&#8208;dependent afterglow color resulting from different thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) behaviors of the isolated and aggregated states. The complex responsiveness based on the hierarchical dual&#8208;mode emission can serve for security features through inkjet printing and ink&#8208;writing. These findings may provide further insight into the regulated persistent luminescence by isolated and aggregated phosphors in doped polymer systems and expand the scope of stimuli&#8208;responsive organic afterglow materials for broader applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Atroposelective Arene&#8208;Forming Wittig Reaction by Phosphorus PIII/PV=O Redox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Wittig reaction is renowned as exceptionally versatile method for converting a diversity of aldehydes and ketones into alkenes. Recently, strategies for chiral phosphine catalysis under PIII/PV=O redox cycling emerged to render this venerable transformation stereoselective. Herein, we describe that phosphine redox catalysis enables the enantioselective synthesis of pertinent biaryl atropisomers by means of a stereocontrolled arene&#8208;forming Wittig reaction. Key to the process is the release of an endogenous base from readily accessible tert&#8208;butyloxycarbonylated Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman adducts triggered by catalyst intramolecularization, permitting mild phosphine redox catalysis for atroposelective Wittig reactions. By this strategy, a broad diversity of biaryl atropisomers is obtained with up to 94:6 enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic Liquid&#8208;accelerated Growth of Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Layer&#8208;stacking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layer&#8208;stacking behaviors are crucial for two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) to define their pore structure, physicochemical properties, and functional output. So far, fine control over the stacking mode without complex procedures remains a grand challenge. Herein, we proposed a &#8220;key&#8208;cylinder lock mimic&#8221; strategy to synthesize 2D COFs with a tunable layer&#8208;stacking mode by taking advantage of ionic liquids (ILs). The staggered (AB) stacking (unlocked) COFs were exclusively obtained by incorporating ILs of symmetric polarity and matching molecular size; otherwise, commonly reported eclipsed (AA) stacking (locked) COFs were observed instead. Mechanistic study revealed that AB stacking was induced by a confined interlocking effect (CIE) brought by anions and bulky cations of the ILs inside pores (&#8220;key&#8221; and &#8220;cylinder&#8221;, respectively). Excitingly, this strategy can speed up production rate of crystalline powders (e.g., COF&#8208;TAPT&#8208;Tf@BmimTf2N in merely 30 minutes) under mild reaction conditions. This work highlights the enabling role of ILs to tailor the layer stacking of 2D COFs and promotes further exploration of their stacking mode&#8208;dependant applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Renal Clearable Nano&#8208;Assembly with F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer Amplified Superoxide Radical and Heat Generation&#160;to Overcome Hypoxia Resistance in Phototherapeutics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given that type I photosensitizers (PSs) possess a good hypoxic tolerance, developing an innovative tactic to construct type I PSs is crucially important, but remains a challenge. Herein, we present a smart molecular design strategy based on the F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) mechanism to develop a type I photodynamic therapy (PDT) agent with an encouraging amplification effect for accurate hypoxic tumor therapy. Of note, benefiting from the FRET effect, the obtained nanostructured type I PDT agent (NanoPcSZ) with boosted light&#8208;harvesting ability not only amplifies superoxide radical (O2&#8226;&#8722;) production but also promotes heat generation upon near&#8208;infrared light irradiation. These features facilitate NanoPcSZ to realize excellent phototherapeutic response under both normal and hypoxic environments. As a result, both in vitro and in vivo experiments achieved a remarkable improvement in therapeutic efficacy via the combined effect of photothermal action and type I photoreaction. Notably, NanoPcSZ can be eliminated from organs (including the liver, lung, spleen, and kidney) apart from the tumor site and excreted through urine within 24 h of its systemic administration. In this way, the potential biotoxicity of drug accumulation can be avoided and the biosafety can be further enhanced.</dc:description>

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Molecular Duplexes Displaying Duplex&#8208;to&#8208;Duplex Switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic duplexes with high stabilities have promising potential for mimicking biomolecular functions and developing supramolecular smart materials. Herein, we describe the synthesis and stimuli&#8208;responsive properties of molecular duplexes derived from indolocarbazole (I)&#8211;pyridine (P) oligomers. These duplexes adopt nonclassical helical structures, stabilized by I&#8211;P hydrogen&#8208;bonding pairs in anhydrous chlorinated solvents. Notably, the longest duplex 62 (11&#8208;mer)2 displays remarkable stability, forming twenty hydrogen bonds; its exchange energy barrier was determined to be &#916;G&#8225; = 22.0 kcal&#183;mol&#8722;1 at 75 &#176;C in anhydrous (CDCl2)2. Upon the addition of water, a hydrated duplex 62 (11&#8208;mer)2&#8835;10H2O was formed, with one water molecule inserted between each I&#8211;P hydrogen&#8208;bonding pair. The Hill coefficient (n) for this process is 6.1, demonstrating extremely positive cooperativity. Conversely, the hydrated duplex 62 (11&#8208;mer)2&#8835;10H2O was completely converted into the original anhydrous duplex 62 (11&#8208;mer)2 when the temperature was increased. Interconversion between these two distinct duplexes can be repeatedly carried out by varying the temperature. Furthermore, reversible switching between hetero&#8208;duplexes and homo&#8208;duplexes was also demonstrated by controlling the temperature, with concomitant changes in the characteristic emission signals.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Benzylic C&#8211;H Etherification Enabled by Base&#8208;Promoted Halogen Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We disclose a benzylic C&#8211;H oxidative coupling reaction with alcohols that proceeds through a synergistic deprotonation, halogenation and substitution sequence. The combination of tert&#8208;butoxide bases with 2&#8208;halothiophene halogen oxidants enables the first general protocol for generating and using benzyl halides through a deprotonative pathway. In contrast to existing radical&#8208;based pathways for C&#8211;H functionalization, this process is guided by C&#8211;H acidity trends. This gives rise to new synthetic capabilities, including the ability to functionalize diverse methyl(hetero)arenes, tolerance of oxidizable and nucleophilic functional groups, precision site&#8208;selectivity for polyalkylarenes and use of a double C&#8211;H etherification process to controllably oxidize methylarenes to benzaldehydes.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Group Polymer Coating on Zn Anode for High Overall Conversion Efficiency Photorechargeable Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The solar&#8208;driven photorechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries have emerged as a promising power solution for smart electronic devices and equipment. However, the subpar cyclic stability of the Zn anode remains a significant impediment to their practical application. Herein, poly(diethynylbenzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triimine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trione) (PDPTT) was designed as a functional polymer coating of Zn. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the PDPTT coating not only significantly homogenizes the electric field distribution on the Zn surface, but also promotes ion&#8208;accessible surface of Zn. With multiple N and C=O groups exhibiting strong adsorption energies, this polymer coating reduces the nucleation overpotential of Zn, alters the diffusion pathway of Zn2+ at the anode interface, and decreases the corrosion current and hydrogen evolution current. Leveraging these advantages, Zn&#8208;PDPTT//Zn&#8208;PDPTT exhibits an exceptionally long cycling time (&#8805;4300 h, 1 mA cm&#8208;2). Zn&#8208;PDPTT//AC zinc&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors can withstand 50,000 cycles at 5 A/g. Zn&#8208;PDPTT//NVO zinc&#8208;ion battery exhibits a faster charge storage rate, higher capacity, and excellent cycling stability. Coupling Zn&#8208;PDPTT//NVO with high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells results in a 13.12% overall conversion efficiency for the photorechargeable zinc&#8208;ion battery, showcasing significant value in advancing the efficiency and upgrading conversion of renewable energy utilization.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The solar-driven photorechargeable zinc-ion batteries have emerged as a promising power solution for smart electronic devices and equipment. However, the subpar cyclic stability of the Zn anode remains a significant impediment to their practical application. Herein, poly(diethynylbenzene-1,3,5-triimine-2,4,6-trione) (PDPTT) was designed as a functional polymer coating of Zn. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the PDPTT coating not only significantly homogenizes the electric field distribution on the Zn surface, but also promotes ion-accessible surface of Zn. With multiple N and C=O groups exhibiting strong adsorption energies, this polymer coating reduces the nucleation overpotential of Zn, alters the diffusion pathway of Zn2+ at the anode interface, and decreases the corrosion current and hydrogen evolution current. Leveraging these advantages, Zn-PDPTT//Zn-PDPTT exhibits an exceptionally long cycling time (&#8805;4300 h, 1 mA cm-2). Zn-PDPTT//AC zinc-ion hybrid capacitors can withstand 50,000 cycles at 5 A/g. Zn-PDPTT//NVO zinc-ion battery exhibits a faster charge storage rate, higher capacity, and excellent cycling stability. Coupling Zn-PDPTT//NVO with high-performance perovskite solar cells results in a 13.12% overall conversion efficiency for the photorechargeable zinc-ion battery, showcasing significant value in advancing the efficiency and upgrading conversion of renewable energy utilization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Detection of Tumor&#8208;Associated Autoantibodies in the Sera of Pancreatic Cancer Patients Using Engineered MUC1 Glycopeptide Nanoparticle Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers worldwide, mainly due to late diagnosis. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel diagnostic approaches to identify the disease as early as possible.
We have developed a diagnostic assay for pancreatic cancer based on the detection of naturally occurring tumor associated autoantibodies against Mucin&#8208;1 (MUC1) using engineered glycopeptides on nanoparticle probes. We used a structure&#8208;guided approach to develop unnatural glycopeptides as model antigens for tumor&#8208;associated MUC1. We designed a collection of 13 glycopeptides to bind either SM3 or 5E5, two monoclonal antibodies with distinct epitopes known to recognize tumor associated MUC1. Glycopeptide binding to SM3 or 5E5 was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance and rationalized by molecular dynamics simulations. These model antigens were conjugated to gold nanoparticles and used in a dot&#8208;blot assay to detect autoantibodies in serum samples from pancreatic cancer patients and healthy volunteers. Nanoparticle probes with glycopeptides displaying the SM3 epitope did not have diagnostic potential. Instead, nanoparticle probes displaying glycopeptides with high affinity for 5E5 could discriminate between cancer patients and healthy controls. Remarkably, the best&#8208;discriminating probes show significantly better true and false positive rates than the current clinical biomarkers CA19&#8208;9 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA).</dc:description>

         <title>Micro&#8208;Ring Morphology of Ag7NCs and Light&#8208;Induced Reversible Interconversion of FCC Ag14NCs via Cu2+ ions&#8208;Mediated Particle&#8208;Assisted Reversible Interconversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the remarkable progress made on intercluster conversion in atomically precise metal nanoclusters (MNCs) and their self&#8208;organization to develop microscopic molecular architecture with well&#8208;defined size and shape, achieving light&#8208;induced reversible structural transformation and the development of micro&#8208;ring self&#8208;assembly in MNCs have, so far, remained elusive. The present investigation touches on these two long&#8208;standing quests by showcasing a new route, light&#8208;induced Particle&#8208;Assisted Reversible Interconversion (PARI) for the reversible transformation from Face Centered Cubic (FCC) Ag14NCs to Ag7NCs. Our studies reveal that the lack of plasmonic silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in the system results in the formation of Ag7NCs with centrosymmetric metallic kernels having hexagonal crystal packing. The molecular self&#8208;organization of Ag7NCs through various non&#8208;covalent interactions such as C&#8208;H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;O, C&#8208;H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;H&#8208;C, and C&#8208;H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#7464; leads to the formation of micro&#8208;ring morphology, a unique molecular architecture in MNCs. The in&#8208;situ generated AgNPs due to the acceleration of the reaction kinetics by Cu2+ ions facilitate the growth of Ag14NCs with FCC metallic kernel. These two structural units of AgNCs show light&#8208;induced reversible structural transformation which is also associated with the reversible tuning of their spectroscopic and morphological signatures. This PARI&#8208;guided interconversion strategy put forward a most appropriate example of a structure&#8208;property relationship in MNCs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Positively charged phosphorus&#8208;containing heterocycles are characteristic core skeletons for functional molecules. While various phosphonium&#8208;containing five&#8208; or six&#8208;membered ring compounds have been reported, seven&#8208;membered ring phosphepinium has not yet been fully studied. In this study, dithieno[2,3&#8208;b;3,2&#8208;f]phosphepinium ions containing electron&#8208;donating aminophenyl groups were synthesized. An X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of the resulting donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor dyes revealed a bent conformation of the central seven&#8208;membered ring. This compound exhibited fluorescence in the near&#8208;infrared region with a bathochromic shift of 70 nm compared to phosphepine oxide congener and a large Stokes shift. High fluorescence quantum yields were obtained even in polar solvents due to the suppression of the nonradiative decay process. The theoretical study revealed that the phosphepinium skeleton is highly electron&#8208;accepting owing to the orbital interaction between a px orbital of the phosphonium moiety and a &#960;* orbital of the 1,3,5&#8208;hexatriene moiety. Owing to the lower&#8208;lying px orbital in the phosphonium moiety compared with that of the phosphine oxide and the bent conformation of the seven&#8208;membered ring, the phosphepinium ring effectively furnishes a px&#8208;&#960;* conjugation. A large structural relaxation with the contribution of a quinoidal resonance structure is suggested in the excited state, which is responsible for the intense emission with a large Stokes shift.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>High&#8208;performance and temperature&#8208;resistant lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), which are able to operate at elevated temperatures (i.e., &gt;60 &#176;C) are highly demanded in various fields, especially in military or aerospace exploration. However, their applications were&#160; impeded by the poor electrochemical performance and unsatisfying safety issues, which was induced by the severe side reactions between electrolytes and electrodes at high temperatures.

         <title>Development of a Dual Factor Activatable Covalent Targeted Photoacoustic Imaging Probe for Tumor Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is an emerging modality in biomedical imaging with superior imaging depth and specificity. However, PAI still has significant limitations, such as the background noise from endogenous chromophores. To overcome these limitations, we developed a covalent activity&#8208;based PAI probe, NOx&#8208;JS013, targeting NCEH1. NCEH1, a highly expressed and activated serine hydrolase in aggressive cancers, has the potential to be employed for the diagnosis of cancers. We show that NOx&#8208;JS013 labels active NCEH1 in live cells with high selectivity relative to other serine hydrolases. NOx&#8208;JS013 also presents its efficacy as a hypoxia&#8208;responsive imaging probe in live cells. Finally, NOx&#8208;JS013 successfully visualizes aggressive prostate cancer tumors in mouse models of PC3, while negligibly detected in tumors of non&#8208;aggressive LNCaP mouse models. These findings show that NOx&#8208;JS013 has the potential to be used to develop precision PAI reagents for detecting metastatic progression in various cancers.</dc:description>

         <title>Selectivity Descriptors of Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Aromatics Process over 3&#8208;Dimensional Zeolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The zeolite&#8208;catalyzed methanol&#8208;to&#8208;aromatics (MTA) process is a promising avenue for industrial decarbonization. This process predominantly utilizes 3&#8208;dimensional 10&#8208;member ring (10&#8208;MR) zeolites like ZSM&#8208;5 and ZSM&#8208;11, chosen for their confinement effect essential for aromatization. Current research mainly focuses on enhancing selectivity and mitigating catalyst deactivation by modulating zeolites' physicochemical properties. Despite the potential, the MTA technology is at a low Technology Readiness Level, hindered by mechanistic complexities in achieving the desired selectivity towards liquid aromatics. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study proposes a roadmap for MTA catalysis by strategically combining controlled catalytic experiments with advanced characterization methods (including operando conditions and &#8220;mobility&#8208;dependent&#8221; solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy). It identifies the descriptor&#8208;role of Koch&#8208;carbonylated intermediates, longer&#8208;chain hydrocarbons, and the zeolites' intersectional cavities in yielding preferential liquid aromatics selectivity. Understanding these selectivity descriptors and architectural impacts is vital, potentially advancing other zeolite&#8208;catalyzed emerging technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Phenyl&#8208;Extended Resorcin[4]arenes: Synthesis and Highly Efficient Iodine Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The continuous exploration of new analogs of calixarenes and pillararenes unlocks infinite opportunities in supramolecular chemistry and materials. In this work, we introduce a new class of macrocycle, phenyl&#8208;extended resorcin[4]arenes (ExR4), a unique and innovative design that incorporates unsubstituted phenylene moieties into the resorcin[4]arene scaffold. Single&#8208;crystal analysis reveals a chair&#8208;like conformation for per&#8208;methylated ExR4 (Me&#8208;ExR4) and a twisted "figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight" shaped conformation for per&#8208;hydroxylated ExR4 (OH&#8208;ExR4). Notably, OH&#8208;ExR4 demonstrates exceptional adsorption capability toward I3&#8722; ions in an aqueous solution, with a rapid kinetic rate of 1.18&#215;10&#8208;2 g&#183;mg&#8208;1&#183;min&#8208;1. Furthermore, OH&#8208;ExR4 shows excellent recyclability and potential as a stationary phase in column setups. The discovery of ExR4 opens up new avenues for constructing new macrocycles and inspires further research in functional adsorption materials for water pollutant removal.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Arylation of Sulfenamides to Access Sulfilimines Enabled by Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur&#8208;containing functional groups have garnered considerable attention owing to their frequent occurrence in ligands, pharmaceuticals and insecticides. However, enantioselective synthesis of sulfilimines, particularly diaryl sulfilimines remains a challenging and long&#8208;standing goal. Herein we report a highly enantio&#8208; and chemoselective cross&#8208;coupling of sulfenamides with aryl electrophiles to construct diverse S(IV) stereocenters by Pd catalysis. Bisphosphine ligands bearing sulfinamide groups were crucial for attaining high reactivity and selectivity. This strategy offers a general, modular and divergent platform for rapid synthesis of chiral sulfilimines and sulfoximines that are otherwise difficult to access. Furthermore, the origins of the high chemoselectivity and enantioselectivity were extensively investigated using density functional theory calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Rare Earth Single&#8208;Atom Catalysis for High&#8208;Performance Li&#8722;S Full Battery with Ultrahigh Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesize the rare earth metal Sm SACs on N&#8208;doped carbon substrate. Theoretical calculations and experimental results both indicate that the Sm SACs have the structure of Sm&#8208;N3C3. With this design, the 4f orbital polarizes the 5d orbital, the electronic states near dxz/yz increases, and the d orbital achieves a maximized overlap with the p orbital when interacting with LiPSs, resulting in an f&#8208;d&#8208;p orbital hybridization which provides high activity for accelerating LiPSs reaction kinetics and Li homogeneous deposition.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries have many advantages but still face problems such as retarded polysulfides redox kinetics and Li dendrite growth. Most reported single atom catalysts (SACs) for Li&#8722;S batteries are based on d&#8208;band transition metals whose d orbital constitutes active valence band, which is inclined to occur catalyst passivation. SACs based on 4f inner valence orbital of rare earth metals are challenging for their great difficulty to be activated. In this work, we design and synthesize the first rare earth metal Sm SACs which has electron&#8208;rich 4f inner orbital to promote catalytic conversion of polysulfides and uniform deposition of Li. Sm SACs enhance the catalysis by the activated 4f orbital through an f&#8208;d&#8208;p orbital hybridization. Using Sm&#8208;N3C3 modified separators, the half cells deliver a high capacity over 600&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a retention rate of 84.3&#8201;% after 2000 cycles. The fabricated Sm&#8208;N3C3&#8208;Li|Sm&#8208;N3C3@PP|S/CNTs full batteries can provide an ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance of a retention rate of 80.6&#8201;% at 0.2&#8201;C after 100 cycles, one of the best full Li&#8722;S batteries. This work provides a new perspective for the development of rare earth metal single atom catalysis in electrochemical reactions of Li&#8722;S batteries and other electrochemical systems for next&#8208;generation energy storage.

         <title>Carboxylesterase Activatable Molecular Probe for Personalized Treatment Guidance by Analyte&#8208;Induced Molecular Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared fluorescence/photoacoustic dual&#8208;mode molecular probe with high specificity and responsiveness of carboxylesterase was developed through the analyte&#8208;induced molecular transformation strategy.







Abstract
Accurate visualization of tumor microenvironment is of great significance for personalized medicine. Here, we develop a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence/photoacoustic (FL/PA) dual&#8208;mode molecular probe (denoted as NIR&#8722;CE) for distinguishing tumors based on carboxylesterase (CE) level by an analyte&#8208;induced molecular transformation (AIMT) strategy. The recognition moiety for CE activity is the acetyl unit of NIR&#8722;CE, generating the pre&#8208;product, NIR&#8722;CE&#8722;OH, which undergoes spontaneous hydrogen atom exchange between the nitrogen atoms in the indole group and the phenol hydroxyl group, eventually transforming into NIR&#8722;CE&#8722;H. In cellular experiments and in vivo blind studies, the human hepatoma cells and tumors with high level of CE were successfully distinguished by both NIR FL and PA imaging. Our findings provide a new molecular imaging strategy for personalized treatment guidance.

         <title>An Enzymatic Prodrug&#8208;like Route to Thio and Selenoamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel enzymatic route to thioamides was elucidated as part of the biosynthesis of the antimetabolite 6&#8208;thioguanine in plant&#8208;pathogenic bacteria. Unexpectedly, an adenylating enzyme forms an intermediate cysteine&#8208;S&#8208;conjugate that is cleaved by a designated C&#8722;S lyase, a process that mirrors a prodrug approach in cancer therapy.







Abstract
6&#8208;Thioguanine (6TG) is a clinically used antitumor agent that was rationally designed as a DNA&#8208;targeting antimetabolite, but it also occurs naturally. 6TG is a critical virulence factor produced by Erwinia amylovorans, a notorious plant pathogen that causes fire blight of pome fruit trees. The biosynthesis of the rare thioamide metabolite involves an adenylating enzyme (YcfA) and a sulfur&#8208;mobilizing enzyme (YcfC), but the mechanism of sulfur transfer and putative intermediates have remained elusive. Through dissection and in vitro reconstitution of the thionation process using diverse substrates, we uncover an intermediate, prodrug&#8208;like thio&#8208;conjugate and elucidate the precise enzyme functions. YcfA not only adenylates GMP but also transfers the mercapto group of l&#8208;cysteine to the activated carbonyl.

     alt="An Enzymatic Prodrug-like Route to Thio and Selenoamides"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel enzymatic route to thioamides was elucidated as part of the biosynthesis of the antimetabolite 6-thioguanine in plant-pathogenic bacteria. Unexpectedly, an adenylating enzyme forms an intermediate cysteine-&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-conjugate that is cleaved by a designated C&#8722;S lyase, a process that mirrors a prodrug approach in cancer therapy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6-Thioguanine (6TG) is a clinically used antitumor agent that was rationally designed as a DNA-targeting antimetabolite, but it also occurs naturally. 6TG is a critical virulence factor produced by &lt;i&gt;Erwinia amylovorans&lt;/i&gt;, a notorious plant pathogen that causes fire blight of pome fruit trees. The biosynthesis of the rare thioamide metabolite involves an adenylating enzyme (YcfA) and a sulfur-mobilizing enzyme (YcfC), but the mechanism of sulfur transfer and putative intermediates have remained elusive. Through dissection and in vitro reconstitution of the thionation process using diverse substrates, we uncover an intermediate, prodrug-like thio-conjugate and elucidate the precise enzyme functions. YcfA not only adenylates GMP but also transfers the mercapto group of &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-cysteine to the activated carbonyl. A designated C&#8722;S lyase (YcfC) then cleaves the resulting &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-adduct to yield the thioamide. This pathway is distinct from canonical tRNA sulfur modifications and known enzymatic peptide thionations. By exploring a wide range of substrate surrogates, we exploited the tolerance of the enzyme pair to produce even a seleno analog. This study provides valuable insight into a previously unexplored area of bacterial thioamide formation and lays the groundwork for synthetic biology approaches to produce thioamide antimetabolites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Bond Crosslinking Strategy Enabling Resilient and Recyclable Electrolyte Elastomers for Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;bond crosslinking strategy is proposed for solid polymer electrolytes to decouple their trade&#8208;off relationships among mechanical, recyclable and conductive properties. The elastically resilient, chemically recyclable and highly conductive solid polymer electrolyte enables 4.3&#8197;V&#8208;class and room&#8208;temperature Li metal batteries with stable cyclability, high rate&#8208;capability and recyclability.







Abstract
Elastomeric solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are highly promising to address the solid&#8208;solid&#8208;interface issues of solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LMBs), but compromises have to be made to balance the intrinsic trade&#8208;offs among their conductive, resilient and recyclable properties. Here, we propose a dual&#8208;bond crosslinking strategy for SPEs to realize simultaneously high ionic conductivity, elastic resilience and recyclability. An elastomeric SPE is therefore designed with hemiaminal dynamic covalent networks and Li+&#8208;dissociation co&#8208;polymer chains, where the &#8722;C&#8722;N&#8208; bond maintains the load&#8208;bearing covalent network under stress but is chemically reversible through a non&#8208;spontaneous reaction, the weaker intramolecular hydrogen bond is mechanically reversible, and the soft chains endow the rapid ion conduction. With this delicate structure, the optimized SPE elastomer achieves high elastic resilience without loading&#8208;unloading hysteresis, outstanding ionic conductivity of 0.2&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 (25&#8201;&#176;C) and chemical recyclability. Then, exceptional room&#8208;temperature performances are obtained for repeated Li plating/stripping tests, and stable cycling of LMBs with either LiFePO4 or 4.3&#8197;V&#8208;class LiFe0.2Mn0.8PO4 cathode. Furthermore, the recycled and reprocessed SPEs can be circularly reused in LMBs without significant performance degradation. Our findings provide an inspiring design principle for SPEs to address the solid&#8208;solid&#8208;interface and sustainability challenges of solid&#8208;state LMBs.

         <title>Acetal&#8208;thiol Click&#8208;like Reaction: Facile and Efficient Synthesis of Dynamic Dithioacetals and Recyclable Polydithioacetals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acetal&#8208;thiol click&#8208;like reaction with high conversion, &gt; acid catalytic acetal&#8208;thiol reaction, and high universality, applicable to all typical types of acetals and thiols, was discovered for the facile synthesis of dynamic dithioacetals and readily recyclable polymers without catalyst and solvent. It provides a green and high&#8208;efficient reaction for the sustainable development of organic, polymer, material, medical chemistries, etc.







Abstract
Dithioacetals are heavily used in organic, material and medical chemistries, and exhibit huge potential to synthesize degradable or recyclable polymers. However, the current synthetic approaches of dithioacetals and polydithioacetals are overwhelmingly dependent on external catalysts and organic solvents. Herein, we disclose a catalyst&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free acetal&#8208;thiol click&#8208;like reaction for synthesizing dithioacetals and polydithioacetals. High conversion, higher than acid catalytic acetal&#8208;thiol reaction, can be achieved. High universality was confirmed by monitoring the reactions of linear and cyclic acetals (including renewable bio&#8208;sourced furan&#8208;acetal) with aliphatic and aromatic thiols, and the reaction mechanism of monomolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN1) and auto&#8208;protonation (activation) by thiol was clarified by combining experiments and density functional theory computation. Subsequently, we utilize this reaction to synthesize readily recyclable polydithioacetals. By simple heating and stirring, linear polydithioacetals with

w of ~110&#8197;kDa were synthesized from acetal and dithiol, and depolymerization into macrocyclic dithioacetal and repolymerization into polydithioacetal can be achieved; through reactive extrusion, a semi&#8208;interpenetrating polymer dynamic network with excellent mechanical properties and continuous reprocessability was prepared from poly(vinyl butyral) and pentaerythritol tetrakis(3&#8208;mercaptopropionate). This green and high&#8208;efficient synthesis method for dithioacetals and polydithioacetals is beneficial to the sustainable development of chemistry.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Bonds Regulate Zinc Plating/Stripping Behaviors for High&#8208;Performance Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intelligent PBSC interface is designed on the zinc anode with self&#8208;adaptation and shear&#8208;thickening properties by blending polyborosiloxane (PBS) and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD). The reversible association/disassociation of dynamic B&#8722;O bonds enhances local structural integrity, effectively impeding continuous zinc dendrite growth and mitigating hydrogen evolution, ensuring stable zinc plating/stripping behaviors with enhanced cycling performance.







Abstract
Artificial interfaces provide a comprehensive approach to controlling zinc dendrite and surface corrosion in zinc&#8208;based aqueous batteries (ZABs). However, due to consistent volume changes during zinc plating/stripping, traditional interfacial layers cannot consistently adapt to the dendrite surface, resulting in uncontrolled dendrite growth and hydrogen evolution. Herein, dynamic covalent bonds exhibit the Janus effect towards zinc deposition at different current densities, presenting a holistic strategy for stabilizing zinc anode. The PBSC intelligent artificial interface consisting of dynamic B&#8722;O covalent bonds is developed on zinc anode to mitigate hydrogen evolution and restrict dendrite expansion. Owing to the reversible dynamic bonds, PBSC exhibits shape self&#8208;adaptive characteristics at low current rates, which rearranges the network to accommodate volume changes during zinc plating/stripping, resisting hydrogen evolution. Moreover, the rapid association of B&#8722;O dynamic bonds enhances mechanical strength at dendrite tips, presenting a shear&#8208;thickening effect and suppressing further dendrite growth at high current rates. Therefore, the assembled symmetrical battery with PBSC maintains a stable cycle of 4500&#8197;hours without significant performance degradation and the PBSC@Zn||V2O5 pouch cell demonstrates a specific capacity exceeding 170&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. Overall, the intelligent interface with dynamic covalent bonds provides innovative approaches for zinc anode interfacial engineering and enhances cycling performance.

         <title>Anion Modulation of Ag&#8208;Imidazole Cuboctahedral Cage Microenvironments for Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have fabricated three Ag4L4 type cuboctahedral coordination cages (Ag&#8208;MOC&#8208;X, X=NO3, ClO4, BF4) which exhibit inner/outside coordination microenvironments, and metal/nonmetal active sites for synergistic enhancement of selectivity for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO in pH&#8208;universal electrolytes.







Abstract
How to achieve CO2 electroreduction in high efficiency is a current challenge with the mechanism not well understood yet. The metal&#8208;organic cages with multiple metal sites, tunable active centers, and well&#8208;defined microenvironments may provide a promising catalyst model. Here, we report self&#8208;assembly of Ag4L4 type cuboctahedral cages from coordination dynamic Ag+ ion and triangular imidazolyl ligand 1,3,5&#8208;tris(1&#8208;benzylbenzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl) benzene (Ag&#8208;MOC&#8208;X, X=NO3, ClO4, BF4) via anion template effect. Notably, Ag&#8208;MOC&#8208;NO3 achieves the highest CO faradaic efficiency in pH&#8208;universal electrolytes of 86.1&#8201;% (acidic), 94.1&#8201;% (neutral) and 95.3&#8201;% (alkaline), much higher than those of Ag&#8208;MOC&#8208;ClO4 and Ag&#8208;MOC&#8208;BF4 with just different counter anions. In situ attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy observes formation of vital intermediate *COOH for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. The density functional theory calculations suggest that the adsorption of CO2 on unsaturated Ag&#8208;site is stabilized by C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen&#8208;bonding of CO2 in a microenvironment surrounded by three benzimidazole rings, and the activation of CO2 is dependent on the coordination dynamics of Ag&#8208;centers modulated by the hosted anions through Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X interactions. This work offers a supramolecular electrocatalytic strategy based on Ag&#8208;coordination geometry and host&#8211;guest interaction regulation of MOCs as high&#8208;efficient electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction to CO which is a key intermediate in chemical industry process.

Here, we report self-assembly of Ag&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; type cuboctahedral cages from coordination dynamic Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion and triangular imidazolyl ligand 1,3,5-tris(1-benzylbenzimidazol-2-yl) benzene (Ag-MOC-X, X=NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) via anion template effect. Notably, Ag-MOC-NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; achieves the highest CO faradaic efficiency in pH-universal electrolytes of 86.1&#8201;% (acidic), 94.1&#8201;% (neutral) and 95.3&#8201;% (alkaline), much higher than those of Ag-MOC-ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and Ag-MOC-BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with just different counter anions. In situ attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy observes formation of vital intermediate *COOH for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-CO conversion. The density functional theory calculations suggest that the adsorption of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on unsaturated Ag-site is stabilized by C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen-bonding of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in a microenvironment surrounded by three benzimidazole rings, and the activation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is dependent on the coordination dynamics of Ag-centers modulated by the hosted anions through Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X interactions. This work offers a supramolecular electrocatalytic strategy based on Ag-coordination geometry and host&#8211;guest interaction regulation of MOCs as high-efficient electrocatalysts for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to CO which is a key intermediate in chemical industry process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fabrication of Coffee&#8208;Ring Nanostructured Membranes for Organic Solvent Nanofiltration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;insoluble crystal monomer that dissolved in EtOH/H2O mixed solvent was designed to react with trimesoyl chloride via interfacial polymerization to construct coffee&#8208;ring structured the membrane. These features render 2.6&#8208;fold enhancement in the effective filtration area of the membrane, and thereby realizing a 2.7&#8208;fold boost in the MeOH permeance. Moreover, the fabricated membrane shows distinctive running stability in active pharmaceutical ingredients purification and the ability for concentration of medicines.







Abstract
Organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) plays important roles in pharmaceutical ingredients purification and solvent recovery. However, the low organic solvent permeance under cross&#8208;flow operation of OSN membrane hampers their industrial applications. Herein, we report the construction of coffee&#8208;ring structured membrane featuring high OSN permeance. A water&#8208;insoluble crystal monomer that dissolved in EtOH/H2O mixed solvent was designed to react with trimesoyl chloride via interfacial polymerization. Owing to the diffusion of EtOH to n&#8208;hexane, coffee&#8208;ring nanostructure on the support membrane appeared, which served as the template for construction of coffee&#8208;ring structured membrane. The optimal nanostructured membrane demonstrated 2.6&#8208;fold enhancement in the effective surface area with reduced membrane thickness. Resultantly, the membrane afforded a 2.7&#8208;fold enhancement in organic solvent permeance, e.g., ~13&#8197;LMH/bar for MeOH, without sacrificing the rejection ability. Moreover, due to the rigid monomer structure, the fabricated membrane shows distinctive running stability in active pharmaceutical ingredients purification and the ability for concentration of medicines.

         <title>Integrated Design for Discrete Sulfur@Polymer Nanoreactor with Tandem Connection as Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the concept of transistor integration, an integrated structure with tandem connection is constructed by confining NS in conductive polymer reaction chambers, forming an interface of discrete nanoreactor units bonded on CNTs. Meanwhile, excellent performance is achieved through tandem connection with CNTs, isolation with PEDOT coating, and synergistic multiplicative effects among SP&#8208;NRs.







Abstract
Apart from electrode material modification, architecture design and optimization are important approaches for improving lithium&#8211;sulfur battery performance. Herein, an integrated structure with tandem connection is constructed by confining nanosulfur (NS) in conductive poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) reaction chambers, forming an interface of discrete independent nanoreactor units bonded onto carbon nanotubes (noted as CNT/NS@PEDOT). The unique spatial confinement and concentration gradients of sulfur@PEDOT nanoreactors (SP&#8208;NRs) can promote reaction kinetics while facilitating rapid polysulfide transformation and minimizing dissolution and diffusion losses. Meanwhile, overall ultrahigh energy input and output are achieved through tandem connection with carbon nanotubes, isolation with PEDOT coating, and synergistic multiplicative effects among SP&#8208;NRs. As a result, it delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 1246&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8201;C and 918&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8201;C, the low capacity decay rate per lap of 0.011&#8201;% is achieved at a current density of 1&#8201;C after 1000 cycles. This research emphasizes the innovative structural design to provide a fresh trajectory for the further advancement of high&#8208;performance energy storage devices.

         <title>Stereoinvertive SN1 Through Neighboring Group Participation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel classification for stereoinvertive nucleophilic substitution through neighboring group participation is presented. Three disctinct modes have been identified: Inversion via Rearrangements, Invertive Intermediate&#8208;Retentive Ring&#8208;opening and Retentive Intermediate&#8208;Invertive Substitution. In each instance, we have elucidated the fundamental principles underlying the stereochemistry and provided representative examples to illustrate the concepts.







Abstract
Neighboring group participation, the assistance of non&#8208;conjugated electrons to a reaction center, is a fundamental phenomenon in chemistry. In the framework of nucleophilic substitution reactions, neighboring group participation is known to cause rate acceleration, first order kinetics (SN1), and retention of configuration. The latter phenomenon is a result of double inversion: the first one when the neighboring group displaces the leaving group, and the second when a nucleophile substitutes the neighboring group. This powerful control of stereoretention has been widely used in organic synthesis for more than a century. However, neighboring group participation may also lead to inversion of configuration, a phenomenon which is often overlooked. Herein, we review this unique mode of stereoinversion, dividing the relevant reactions into three classes with the aim to introduce a fresh perspective on the different modes of stereoinversion via neighboring group participation as well as the factors that control this stereochemical outcome.

         <title>Cobaltaelectro&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8211;H Activation for Central and Axial Double Enantio&#8208;Induction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cobaltaelectro&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation was devised to access molecules with central and axial chirality with up to &gt;99&#8201;% enantiomeric excess and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 diastereomeric ratio. The cobaltaelectro&#8208;catalysis was enabled by highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
In recent years, enantioselective electrocatalysis has surfaced as an increasingly&#8208;effective platform for sustainable molecular synthesis. Despite indisputable progress, strategies that allow the control of two distinct stereogenic elements with high selectivity remain elusive. In contrast, we, herein, describe electrochemical cobalt&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activations that enable the installation of chiral stereogenic centers along with a chiral axis with high levels of enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. The developed electrocatalysis strategy allowed for C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H activations/annulations with cyclic and non&#8208;cyclic alkenes providing expedient access to various central as well as atropo&#8208;chiral dihydroisoquinolinones paired to the valuable hydrogen evolution reaction. Studies on the atropo&#8208;stability of the obtained compounds demonstrated that the exceedingly mild conditions ensured by the electrocatalytic process were key for the achieved high stereoselectivities.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: 2D Exfoliation Chemistry Towards Covalent Pseudo&#8208;Layered Phosphate Framework Derived by Radical/Strain&#8208;Synergistical Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The radicals, in collaboration with water molecules, drive the breakage of V&#8208;F&#8208;V bonds in bulk phase phosphate and subsequently form a new 2D phosphate through recoordination, as reported by Xing&#8208;Long Wu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202402371). The 2D phosphate exhibits superior carrier transport capability, lower Na+ migration barriers, and reduced volumetric strain, endowing it with excellent fast charging characteristics as sodium&#8208;ion battery cathodes. This effective strategy will provide a new insight for the optimization of SIBs.

The 2D phosphate exhibits superior carrier transport capability, lower Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; migration barriers, and reduced volumetric strain, endowing it with excellent fast charging characteristics as sodium-ion battery cathodes. This effective strategy will provide a new insight for the optimization of SIBs.

         <dc:description>
Superchaotropic boron clusters have been systematically studied to understand the principles modulating their ability to transport hydrophilic cargos across lipid membranes and inside cells. In their Research Article (e202404286), Irene Lostal&#233;&#8208;Seijo, Werner M. Nau, Javier Montenegro et al. showed that size and polarizability are more important than the chemical composition of the clusters, establishing the bases for the prediction of their carrier potential and toxicity.

         <title>Streamlining the Synthesis of Pyridones through Oxidative Amination of Cyclopentenones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the development of an oxidative amination process for the streamlined synthesis of pyridones from cyclopentenones. Cyclopentenone building blocks can undergo in situ silyl enol ether formation, followed by the introduction of a nitrogen atom into the carbon skeleton with successive aromatisation to yield pyridones. The reaction sequence is operationally simple, rapid, and carried out in one pot. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, exhibits broad functional group tolerance, complete regioselectivity, and is well scalable. The developed method provides facile access to the synthesis of 15N&#8208;labelled targets, industrially relevant pyridone products and their derivatives in a fast and efficient way.</dc:description>

         <title>Function Switch of a Fungal Sesterterpene Synthase through Molecular Dynamics Simulation Assisted Alteration of an Aromatic Residue Cluster in the Active Pocket of PfNS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Terpene synthases (TPSs) play pivotal roles in generating diverse terpenoids through complex cyclization pathways. Protein engineering of TPSs offers a crucial approach to expanding terpene diversity. However, significant potential remains untapped due to limited understanding of the structure&#8208;function relationships of TPSs. In this investigation, using a joint approach of molecular dynamics simulations&#8208;assisted engineering and site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, we manipulated the aromatic residue cluster (ARC) of a bifunctional terpene synthase (BFTPS), Pestalotiopsisfici nigtetraene synthase (PfNS). This led to the discovery of previously unreported catalytic functions yielding different cyclization patterns of sesterterpenes. Specifically, a quadruple variant (F89A/Y113F/W193L/T194W) completely altered PfNS's function, converting it from producing the bicyclic sesterterpene nigtetraene to the tricyclic ophiobolin F. Additionally, analysis of catalytic profiles by double, triple, and quadruple variants demonstrated that the ARC functions as a switch, unprecedently redirecting the production of 5/11 bicyclic (Type B) sesterterpenes to 5/15 bicyclic (Type A) ones. Molecular dynamics simulations and theozyme calculations further elucidated that, in addition to cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, C&#8722;H&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;&#960; interactions also play a key role in the cyclization patterns. This study offers a feasible strategy in protein engineering of TPSs for various industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecule Design for Non&#8208;Aqueous Wide&#8208;Temperature Electrolytes via the Intelligentized Screening Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Operating a lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) in a wide temperature range is essential for ensuring a stable electricity supply amidst fluctuating temperatures caused by climate or terrain changes. Electrolyte plays a pivotal role in determining the temperature durability of batteries. However, specialized electrolytes designed for either low or high temperatures typically possess distinct features. Therefore, wide&#8208;temperature electrolytes (WTEs) are necessary as they encompass a combination of diverse properties, which complicates the clear instruction of WTE design. Here we represent an artificial intelligence (Al)&#8208;assisted workflow of WTE design through stepwise parameterizations and calculations. Linear mono&#8208;nitriles are identified as ideal wide&#8208;liquidus&#8208;range solvents that can &#8220;softly&#8221; solvate lithium ions by weak interactions. In addition, the explainable modules revealed the halogenoid similarity of cyanide as fluorine on the electrolyte properties (e.g. boiling point and dielectric constant). With the further introduction of an ether bond, 3&#8208;methoxypropionitrile (MPN) has been eventually determined as a main electrolyte solvent, enabling the battery operation from &#8722;60 to 120&#176;C. Particularly, a LiCoO2/Li cell using the proposed WTE can realize stable cycling with capacity retention reaching 72.3% after 50 cycles under a high temperature of 100&#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Reversibility and Stability of Mg Metal Anodes: High&#8208;Exposure (002) Facets and Nanosheet Arrays for Superior Mg Plating/Stripping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magnesium metal batteries (MMBs), recognized as promising contenders for post&#8208;lithium battery technologies, face challenges such as uneven magnesium (Mg) plating and stripping behaviors, leading to uncontrollable dendrite growth and irreversible structural damage. Herein, we have developed a Mg foil featuring prominently exposed (002) facets and an architecture of nanosheet arrays (termed (002)&#8208;Mg), created through a one&#8208;step acid etching method. Specifically, the prominent exposure of Mg (002) facets, known for their inherently low surface and adsorption energies with Mg atoms, not only facilitates smooth nucleation and dense deposition but also significantly mitigates side reactions on the Mg anode. Moreover, the nanosheet arrays on the surface evenly distribute the electric field and Mg ion flux, enhancing Mg ion transfer kinetics. As a result, the fabricated (002)&#8208;Mg electrodes exhibit unprecedented long&#8208;cycle performance, lasting over 6000 h (&gt; 8 months) at a current density of 3 mA cm&#8722;2 for a capacity of 3 mAh cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the corresponding pouch cells equipped with various electrolytes and cathodes demonstrate remarkable capacity and cycling stability, highlighting the superior electrochemical compatibility of the (002)&#8208;Mg electrode. This study provides new insights into the advancement of durable MMBs by modifying the crystal structure and morphology of Mg.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerating the Discovery of Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysts: High&#8208;Throughput Screening of Element Combinations in Pt&#8208;Based High&#8208;Entropy Alloys</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The vast number of element combinations and the explosive growth of composition space pose significant challenges to the development of high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs). Here, we propose a procedural research method aimed at accelerating the discovery of efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) based on Pt&#8208;based quinary HEAs. The method begins with an element library provided by a large language model (LLM), combined with microscale precursor printing and pulse high&#8208;temperature synthesis techniques to prepare multi&#8208;element combination HEA array in one step. Through high&#8208;throughput measurement using scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM), precise identification of highly active HEA element combinations and exploration of composition space for a specific combination are achieved. Advantageous element combinations are further validated in practical electrocatalytic evaluations. The contributions of individual element sites and the synergistic effects among elements of such HEAs in enhancing reaction activity are elucidated via density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This method integrates high&#8208;throughput experiments, practical catalyst validation, and DFT calculations, providing a new pathway for accelerating the discovery of efficient multi&#8208;element materials in the field of energy catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanometer&#8208;Resolved Mapping of Organic Cation Migration Behavior in Methylammonium Lead Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The performance and stability of organic metal halide perovskite (OMHP) optoelectronic devices have been associated with ion migration. Understanding of nanoscale resolved organic cation migration mechanism would facilitate structure engineering and commercialization of OMHP. Here, we report a three&#8208;dimensional approach for in situ nanoscale infrared imaging of organic ion migration behavior in OMHPs, enabling to distinguish migrations along grain boundary and in crystal lattice. Our results reveal that organic cation migration along OMHP film surface and grain boundaries (GBs) occurs at lower biases than in crystal lattice. We visualize the transition of organic cation migration channels from GBs to volume upon increasing electric field. The temporal resolved results demonstrate the fast MA+ migration kinetics at GBs, which is comparable to diffusivity of halide ions. Our findings help understand the role of organic cations in the performance of OMHP devices, and the proposed approach holds broad applicability for revealing migration mechanisms of organic ions in OMHPs based optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Cucurbit[8]uril Mediated Supramolecular Heterodimerisation and Photoinduced [2+2] Heterocycloaddition to Generate Unexpected [2]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In contrast to the self&#8208;assembly of homosupramolecules, the self&#8208;assembly of heterosupramolecules is more challenging and significant in various fields. Herein, we design and investigate a cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;mediated heterodimerisation using an arene&#8208;fluoroarene strategy. Moreover, the resulting heteroternary complex is found to be able to undergo a photoinduced [2+2] heterocycloaddition, resulting in the formation of an unexpected [2]rotaxane structure. This work demonstrates a novel supramolecular heterodimerisation system, not only contributing to the development of photoisomerisation systems, but also enriching synthetic methodologies of mechanically interlocked molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>From Coordination to &#960;&#8208;Hole Chemistry of Transition Metals: Metalloporphyrins as a Case of Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we have evidenced the formation of favorable &#960;&#8208;hole Br&#183;&#183;&#183;metal noncovalent interactions (NCIs) involving elements from groups 9, 11 and 12. More in detail, M (M = Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+) containing porphyrins have been synthesized and their supramolecular assemblies structurally characterized by means of single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and Hirshfeld surface analyses, revealing the formation of directional Br&#183;&#183;&#183;M contacts in addition to ancillary hydrogen bond and lone pair&#8208;&#960; bonds. Computations at the PBE0&#8208;D3/def2&#8208;TZVP level of theory revealed the &#960;&#8208;hole nature of the Br&#183;&#183;&#183;M interaction. In addition, the physical nature of these NCIs was studied using Quantum Chemistry methodologies, providing evidence of &#960;&#8208;hole Spodium and Regium bonds in Zn2+ and Cu2+ porphyrins, in addition to unveiling the presence of &#160;a &#960;&#8208;hole for group 9 (Co2+). On the other hand, group 10 (Ni2+) acted as both electron donor and acceptor moiety without showing an electropositive &#960;&#8208;hole. Owing to the underexplored potential of &#960;&#8208;hole interactions in transition metal chemistry, we believe the results reported herein will be useful in supramolecular chemistry, organometallics, and solid&#8208;state chemistry by i) putting under the spotlight the &#960;&#8208;hole chemistry involving first row transition metals and ii) unlocking a new tool to direct the self&#8208;assembly of metalloporphyrins.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphetene&#8208;based polyaromatics: structure&#8208;property relationships and chiroptical tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the synthesis of &#960;&#8208;extended phosphetene rings (4&#8208;member P&#8208;rings) flanked with PAH systems of various topologies. These compounds are fully characterized including X&#8208;ray diffraction. The impact of both the polyaromatic platform and the P&#8208;ring on the structure, and the optical and redox properties are investigated both experimentally and theoretically. Although neither the P centre nor the 4&#8208;membered ring significantly takes part in the HOMO or LUMO orbitals, both structural features have an important modulating role in distorting the symmetry of the orbitals, leading to chiroptical properties. The stereogenic P&#8208;atom is used as a remote chiral perturbator to induce circularly polarized luminescence of the polyaromatic system. The dissymmetry factor is highly dependent on the polyaromatic topology, as supported by theoretical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Aggregation of One&#8208;Dimensional Wires: The Case of Long Oligoynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We show an unexpected aggregation phenomenon of a long oligoyne (Py[16]) with 16 contiguous triple bonds and endcapped with bulky 3,5&#8208;bi(3,5&#8208;bis&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl)pyridine groups. Aggregation of 1D p&#8208;conjugated oligoyne chains is rare, given the minimal p&#8208;p intermolecular interactions of the weakly polarizable polyyne chain, as well as its flexibility that works against self assembly. In dilute solutions, the reversible aggregation of Py[16] initiates at low temperature in the range of 140&#8211;180 K, and is not observed for shorter oligoynes in this series. Cryogenic UV&#8208;Vis electronic absorption spectra and vibrational Raman spectra with different laser wavelength lines tuning from in&#8208;resonance to off&#8208;resonance conditions have been used to extract the vibrational features characterizing the Monomer and aggregate species. Theoretical calculations complement the spectroscopic findings.</dc:description>

         <title>Potent Immunomodulators Developed from an Unstable Bacterial Metabolite of Vitamin B2 Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transient bacterial metabolite that potently activates T lymphocytes called MAIT cells is too unstable in water to fully exploit in biology. Here, we describe highly stable and extremely potent new immunostimulants, immunosuppressants, and probes that shed new light on the mechanism of MAIT cell activation. These new chemical tools offer fresh insights for designing novel vaccines, anticancer, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and anti&#8208;infective drugs.







Abstract
Bacterial synthesis of vitamin B2 generates a by&#8208;product, 5&#8208;(2&#8208;oxopropylideneamino)&#8208;d&#8208;ribityl&#8208;aminouracil (5&#8208;OP&#8208;RU), with potent immunological properties in mammals, but it is rapidly degraded in water. This natural product covalently bonds to the key immunological protein MR1 in the endoplasmic reticulum of antigen presenting cells (APCs), enabling MR1 refolding and trafficking to the cell surface, where it interacts with T cell receptors (TCRs) on mucosal associated invariant T lymphocytes (MAIT cells), activating their immunological and antimicrobial properties.

This chemical study advances our molecular understanding of how bacterial metabolites are captured by MR1, influence cell surface expression of MR1, interact with T cells to induce immunity, and offers novel clues for developing new vaccine adjuvants, immunotherapeutics, and anticancer drugs.

     alt="Potent Immunomodulators Developed from an Unstable Bacterial Metabolite of Vitamin B2 Biosynthesis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A transient bacterial metabolite that potently activates T lymphocytes called MAIT cells is too unstable in water to fully exploit in biology. Here, we describe highly stable and extremely potent new immunostimulants, immunosuppressants, and probes that shed new light on the mechanism of MAIT cell activation. These new chemical tools offer fresh insights for designing novel vaccines, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and anti-infective drugs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacterial synthesis of vitamin B2 generates a by-product, 5-(2-oxopropylideneamino)-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-ribityl-aminouracil (5-OP-RU), with potent immunological properties in mammals, but it is rapidly degraded in water. This natural product covalently bonds to the key immunological protein MR1 in the endoplasmic reticulum of antigen presenting cells (APCs), enabling MR1 refolding and trafficking to the cell surface, where it interacts with T cell receptors (TCRs) on mucosal associated invariant T lymphocytes (MAIT cells), activating their immunological and antimicrobial properties. Here, we strategically modify this natural product to understand the molecular basis of its recognition by MR1. This culminated in the discovery of new water-stable compounds with extremely powerful and distinctive immunological functions. We report their capacity to bind MR1 inside APCs, triggering its expression on the cell surface (EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 17&#8197;nM), and their potent activation (EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 56&#8197;pM) or inhibition (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 80&#8197;nM) of interacting MAIT cells. We further derivatize compounds with diazirine-alkyne, biotin, or fluorophore (Cy5 or AF647) labels for detecting, monitoring, and studying cellular MR1. Computer modeling casts new light on the molecular mechanism of activation, revealing that potent activators are first captured in a tyrosine- and serine-lined cleft in MR1 via specific pi-interactions and H-bonds, before more tightly attaching via a covalent bond to Lys43 in MR1.

         <title>Controlling the Orientation&#8208;Dependent Second Harmonic Generation in Hybrid Germanium Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facet engineering is an effective approach to enhance second harmonic generation (SHG) efficiency. Here, we demonstrate the larger polarization from the higher in&#8208;plane polar units [GeI3]&#8722; density within the (101) MAGeI3, results in the stronger SHG in the (101)&#8208;oriented than the (210)&#8208;oriented methylammonium germanium iodide crystals.







Abstract
Manipulating the crystal orientation plays a crucial role in the conversion efficiency during second harmonic generation (SHG). Here, we provide a new strategy in controlling the surface&#8208;dependent anisotropic SHG with the precise design of (101) and (2

Temperature&#8208;dependent steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy show shorter lifetime and wider emission band in the (101) MAGeI3 single crystal, revealing the higher defect states. Additionally, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns show the (101) MAGeI3 possesses larger in&#8208;plane polar units [GeI3]&#8722; density, which could directly enhance the spontaneous polarization in the (101) facet. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation further demonstrates the higher intrinsic polarization in the (101) facet compared with the (2

         <title>Tuning Adsorbate&#8208;Mediated Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction by Oxygen Vacancy: A Case Study in Ru/TiO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulating the initial oxygen vacancy concentration of a catalyst supports can regulate the formation of adsorbate&#8208;mediated strong metal&#8208;support interaction (A&#8208;SMSI) and its stability under reaction conditions. The concept is demonstrated for CO2 hydrogenation on Ru/TiO2.







Abstract
The adsorbate&#8208;mediated strong metal&#8208;support interaction (A&#8208;SMSI) offers a reversible means of altering the selectivity of supported metal catalysts, thereby providing a powerful tool for facile modulation of catalytic performance. However, the fundamental understanding of A&#8208;SMSI remains inadequate and methods for tuning A&#8208;SMSI are still in their nascent stages, impeding its stabilization under reaction conditions. Here, we report that the initial concentration of oxygen vacancy in oxide supports plays a key role in tuning the A&#8208;SMSI between Ru nanoparticles and defected titania (TiO2&#8208;x). Based on this new understanding, we demonstrate the in situ formation of A&#8208;SMSI under reaction conditions, obviating the typically required CO2&#8208;rich pretreatment. The as&#8208;formed A&#8208;SMSI layer exhibits remarkable stability at various temperatures, enabling excellent activity, selectivity and long&#8208;term stability in catalyzing the reverse water gas&#8208;shift reaction. This study deepens the understanding of the A&#8208;SMSI and the ability to stabilize A&#8208;SMSI under reaction conditions represents a key step for practical catalytic applications.

         <title>Platelet&#8208;Drug Conjugates Engineered via One&#8208;step Fusion Approach for Metastatic and Postoperative Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Platelet&#8208;drug conjugates could be prepared via one&#8208;step fusion with multiple&#8208;drug loaded liposomes. Platelets loaded with chemotherapy agent doxorubicin and cytokine IL&#8208;15 triggered anti&#8208;tumor immune response and inhibited melanoma recurrence in metastatic and postoperative tumor models.







Abstract
The exploration of cell&#8208;based drug delivery systems for cancer therapy has gained growing attention. Approaches to engineering therapeutic cells with multidrug loading in an effective, safe, and precise manner while preserving their inherent biological properties remain of great interest. Here, we report a strategy to simultaneously load multiple drugs in platelets in a one&#8208;step fusion process. We demonstrate doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;encapsulated liposomes conjugated with interleukin&#8208;15 (IL&#8208;15) could fuse with platelets to achieve both cytoplasmic drug loading and surface cytokine modification with a loading efficiency of over 70&#8201;% within minutes. Due to their inherent targeting ability to metastatic cancers and postoperative bleeding sites, the engineered platelets demonstrated a synergistic therapeutic effect to suppress lung metastasis and postoperative recurrence in mouse B16F10 melanoma tumor models.

         <title>Bridged Pt&#8722;OH&#8722;Mn Mediator in N&#8208;coordinated Mn Single Atoms and Pt Nanoparticles for Electrochemical Biomolecule Oxidation and Discrimination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid catalyst composed of carbon&#8208;supported Pt nanoparticles and nitrogen&#8208;coordinated Mn single atoms is developed for biomolecule electrooxidation. The direct electron transfer between Pt nanoparticles and Mn single atoms as well as the construction of bridged Pt&#8722;OH&#8722;Mn mediators during reaction result in a significant improvement in detection and discrimination performances towards dopamine and uric acid.







Abstract
The rational design of efficient catalysts for uric acid (UA) electrooxidation, as well as the establishment of structure&#8208;activity relationships, remains a critical bottleneck in the field of electrochemical sensing. To address these challenges, herein, a hybrid catalyst that integrates carbon&#8208;supported Pt nanoparticles and nitrogen&#8208;coordinated Mn single atoms (PtNPs/MnNC) is developed. The metal&#8208;metal interaction during annealing affords the construction of metallic&#8208;bonded Pt&#8722;Mn pairs between PtNPs and Mn single atoms, facilitating the electron transfer from PtNPs to the support and thereby optimizing the electronic structure of catalysts. More importantly, experiments and theoretical calculations provide visual proof for the &#8216;incipient hydrous oxide adatom mediator&#8217; mechanism for UA oxidation. The Pt&#8722;Mn pairs first adsorb OH* to construct the bridged Pt&#8722;OH&#8722;Mn mediators to serve as a highly active intermediate for N&#8722;H bond dissociation and proton transfer. Benefiting from the unique electronic and geometric structure of the catalytic center and reactive intermediates, PtNPs/MnNC exhibits superior electrooxidation performance. The electrochemical sensor based on PtNPs/MnNC enables sensitive detection and discrimination of UA and dopamine in serum samples. This work offers new insights into the construction of novel electrocatalysts for sensitive sensing platforms.

         <title>Enhancing the Cycle Life of Zinc&#8211;Iodine Batteries in Ionic Liquid&#8208;Based Electrolytes</title>

Xiao et&#8197;al. demonstrate the use of an ionic liquid (IL) additive in zinc&#8208;iodine (Zn&#8722;I2) batteries, which serves to optimize Zn solvation and the anode interface, as well as aids in inhibiting polyiodide dissolution. The research findings reveal a capacity decay rate of 0.01&#8201;% per cycle over 18,000 cycles (4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) in a full cell. Such promising results suggest a significant advancement in the field, offering high performing Zn&#8722;I2 batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8722;I2) batteries are gaining significant attention due to their low&#8208;cost, high safety and high theoretical capacity. Nevertheless, their long cycle and durability have been hampered due to the use of aqueous media that, over time, lead to Zn dendrite formation, hydrogen evolution reaction, and polyiodide dissolution. Xiao et&#8197;al. recently reported the addition of an imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid (IL) to an aqueous electrolyte and found that the IL plays a key role in modifying the solvation of Zn2+ ions in the bulk electrolyte and the inner Helmholtz plane,&#160;repelling H2O molecules away from the Zn anode surface. UV/Vis and NMR spectroscopy also indicates a strong interaction between imidazolium cation [EMIM]+ and I3&#8722;, thereby reducing polyiodide shuttling and enhancing the cycle life of the battery. Overall, a capacity decay rate of only 0.01&#8201;% per cycle after over 18,000 cycles at 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, is observed, making the use of IL additives in aqueous electrolytes highly promising candidates for Zn&#8722;I2 batteries.

         <title>Core&#8208;Alkynylated Fluorescent Flippers: Altered Ultrafast Photophysics to Track Thick Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elongated flipper probes with one and two alkynes in the core merge flipper&#8208; and rotor&#8208;like behavior to take photophysical properties to a new level of sophistication and introduce hydrophobic matching with one single leaflet as operational strategy to mechanosensitively track bilayer membranes by their thickness.







Abstract
Fluorescent flippers have been introduced as small&#8208;molecule probes to image membrane tension in living systems. This study describes the design, synthesis, spectroscopic and imaging properties of flippers that are elongated by one and two alkynes inserted between the push and the pull dithienothiophene domains. The resulting mechanophores combine characteristics of flippers, reporting on physical compression in the ground state, and molecular rotors, reporting on torsional motion in the excited state, to take their photophysics to new level of sophistication. Intensity ratios in broadened excitation bands from differently twisted conformers of core&#8208;alkynylated flippers thus report on mechanical compression. Lifetime boosts from ultrafast excited&#8208;state planarization and lifetime drops from competitive intersystem crossing into triplet states report on viscosity. In standard lipid bilayer membranes, core&#8208;alkynylated flippers are too long for one leaflet and tilt or extend into disordered interleaflet space, which preserves rotor&#8208;like torsional disorder and thus weak, blue&#8208;shifted fluorescence. Flipper&#8208;like planarization occurs only in highly ordered membranes of matching leaflet thickness, where they light up and selectively report on these thick membranes with red&#8208;shifted, sharpened excitation maxima, high intensity and long lifetime.

         <title>Hydrazone&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides an introduction on the recent progresses made in the field of hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs for various applications including adsorption/separation, catalysis, chemical sensing and energy storage.







Abstract
Hydrazone&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with structural flexibility, heteroatomic sites, post&#8208;modification ability and high hydrolytic stability have attracted great attention from scientific community. Hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs, as a subclass of Schiff&#8208;base COFs, was firstly reported in 2011 by Yaghi's group and later witnessed prosperous development in various aspects. Their adjustable structures, precise pore channels and plentiful heteroatomic sites of hydrazone&#8208;linked structures possess much potential in diverse applications, for example, adsorption/separation, chemical sensing, catalysis and energy storage, etc. Up to date, the systematic reviews about the reported hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs are still rare. Therefore, in this review, we will summarize their preparation methods, characteristics and related applications, and discuss the opportunity or challenge of hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs. We hope this review could provide new insights about hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs for exploring more appealing functions or applications.

         <title>A Hydroxylamine&#8208;Mediated Amidination of Lysine Residues That Retains the Protein's Positive Charge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroxylamine and nitrile groups efficiently enable lysine&#8208;selective amidination of peptides and proteins. The amidine products retain a positive charge at the modified sites and allow the charge&#8208;related properties to be preserved, such as the liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation and the interaction with negatively charged DNA to form protein&#8208;DNA fibres. The amidine products can undergo multi&#8208;site secondary modifications.







Abstract
Lysine&#8208;specific peptide and protein modification strategies are widely used to study charge&#8208;related functions and applications. However, these strategies often result in the loss of the positive charge on lysine, significantly impacting the charge&#8208;related properties of proteins. Herein, we report a strategy to preserve the positive charge and selectively convert amines in lysine side chains to amidines using nitriles and hydroxylamine under aqueous conditions. Various unprotected peptides and proteins were successfully modified with a high conversion rate. Moreover, the reactive amidine moiety and derived modification site enable subsequent secondary modifications. Notably, positive charges were retained during the modification. Therefore, positive charge&#8208;related protein properties, such as liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation behaviour of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, were not affected. This strategy was subsequently applied to a lysine rich protein to develop an amidine&#8208;containing coacervate DNA complex with outstanding mechanical properties. Overall, our innovative strategy provides a new avenue to explore the characteristics of positively charged proteins.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Efficient Co&#8208;production of Benzoquinone and H2 Using Waste Phenol in a Hybrid Alkali/Acid Flow Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a heterogeneous nano&#8208;electrocatalyst consisting of Ni9S8&#8208;Ni15O16/NF was synthesized using a partial vulcanization method for composition design. The resulting catalyst demonstrated exceptional electrochemical oxidation performance of phenol (EOP). The self&#8208;assembled alkali&#8208;acid hybrid electrolytic cell can operate continuously for more than 300&#8197;hours at a fixed potential of 0.9&#8197;V. At the same time, through the design and equipment integration of the alkali&#8208;acid electrolytic cell, for the very first time, the anodic oxidation of phenol organic pollutants with the cathodic hydrogen production.







Abstract
In both the manufacturing and chemical industries, benzoquinone is a crucial chemical product. A perfect and economical method for making benzoquinone is the electrochemical oxidation of phenol, thanks to the traditional thermal catalytic oxidation of phenol process requires high cost, serious pollution and harsh reaction conditions. Here, a unique heterostructure electrocatalyst on nickel foam (NF) consisting of nickel sulfide and nickel oxide (Ni9S8&#8208;Ni15O16/NF) was produced, and this catalyst exhibited a low overpotential (1.35&#8197;V vs. RHE) and prominent selectivity (99&#8201;%) for electrochemical phenol oxidation reaction (EOP). Ni9S8&#8208;Ni15O16/NF is beneficial for lowering the reaction energy barrier and boosting reactivity in the EOP process according to density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Additionally, an alkali/acid hybrid flow cell was successfully established by connecting Ni9S8&#8208;Ni15O16/NF and commercial RuIr/Ti in series to catalyze phenol oxidation in an alkaline medium and hydrogen evolution in an acid medium, respectively. A cell voltage of only 0.60&#8197;V was applied to produce a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Meanwhile, the system continued to operate at 0.90&#8197;V for 12&#8197;days, showing remarkable long&#8208;term stability. The unique configuration of the acid&#8208;base hybrid flow cell electrolyzer provides valuable guidance for the efficient and environmentally friendly electrooxidation of phenol to benzoquinone.

Here, a unique heterostructure electrocatalyst on nickel foam (NF) consisting of nickel sulfide and nickel oxide (Ni&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;-Ni&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;/NF) was produced, and this catalyst exhibited a low overpotential (1.35&#8197;V vs. RHE) and prominent selectivity (99&#8201;%) for electrochemical phenol oxidation reaction (EOP). Ni&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;-Ni&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;/NF is beneficial for lowering the reaction energy barrier and boosting reactivity in the EOP process according to density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Additionally, an alkali/acid hybrid flow cell was successfully established by connecting Ni&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;-Ni&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;/NF and commercial RuIr/Ti in series to catalyze phenol oxidation in an alkaline medium and hydrogen evolution in an acid medium, respectively. A cell voltage of only 0.60&#8197;V was applied to produce a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Meanwhile, the system continued to operate at 0.90&#8197;V for 12&#8197;days, showing remarkable long-term stability. The unique configuration of the acid-base hybrid flow cell electrolyzer provides valuable guidance for the efficient and environmentally friendly electrooxidation of phenol to benzoquinone.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multiple&#8208;State Control over Supramolecular Chirality through Dynamic Chemistry Mediated Molecular Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The N&#8208;protected fluorinated amino acid was employed as the major building unit to manipulate chirality in multiple&#8208;state switchable states. It flexibly employs constitutional dynamic chemistry including covalent and noncovalent manner to allow five&#8208;state control over supramolecular chirality, shedding light on the rational design of responsive materials as well chiroptical switch.







Abstract
Dynamic chemistry utilizing both covalent and noncovalent bonds provides valid protocols in manipulating properties of self&#8208;assemblies and functions. Here we employ dynamic chemistry to realize multiple&#8208;route control over supramolecular chirality up to five states. N&#8208;protected fluorinated phenylalanine in the carboxylate state self&#8208;assembled into achiral nanoparticles ascribed to the amphiphilicity. Protonation promoted one&#8208;dimensional growth into helices with shrunk hydrophilicity, which in the presence of disulfide pyridine undergo chirality inversion promoted by the hydrogen bonding&#8208;directed coassembly. Further interacting with the water&#8208;soluble reductant cleavages the disulfide bond to initiate the rearrangement of coassemblies with a chirality inversion as well. Finally, by tuning the pH environments, aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction between reduced products and perfluorinated phenylalanine occurs, giving distinct chiral nanoarchitectures with emerged luminescence and circularly polarized luminescence. We thus realized a particular five&#8208;state control by combining dynamic chemistry at one chiral compound, which greatly enriches the toolbox in fabricating responsive chiroptical materials.

         <title>Unimolecular Chemiexcited Oxygenation of Pathogenic Amyloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amyloid degradation without photoirradiation. Cypridina luciferin analogs, dmCLA&#8208;X, are chemiexcited through autoxidation, leading to amyloid&#8208;selective oxygenation in the dark. Oxygenated A&#946; furnishes reduced aggregation potency and cytotoxicity. The chemiexcitation strategy may be effective in treating amyloidosis by alleviating pathogenetic amyloids accumulated deep in the brain, where light hardly reaches.







Abstract
Pathogenic protein aggregates, called amyloids, are etiologically relevant to various diseases, including neurodegenerative Alzheimer disease. Catalytic photooxygenation of amyloids, such as amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;), reduces their toxicity; however, the requirement for light irradiation may limit its utility in large animals, including humans, due to the low tissue permeability of light. Here, we report that Cypridina luciferin analogs, dmCLA&#8208;Cl and dmCLA&#8208;Br, promoted selective oxygenation of amyloids through chemiexcitation without external light irradiation. Further structural optimization of dmCLA&#8208;Cl led to the identification of a derivative with a polar carboxylate functional group and low cellular toxicity: dmCLA&#8208;Cl&#8208;acid. dmCLA&#8208;Cl&#8208;acid promoted oxygenation of A&#946; amyloid and reduced its cellular toxicity without photoirradiation. The chemiexcited oxygenation developed in this study may be an effective approach to neutralizing the toxicity of amyloids, which can accumulate deep inside the body, and treating amyloidosis.

         <title>Orchestrated Octuple C&#8722;H Activation: A Bottom&#8208;Up Topology Engineering Approach toward Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Double&#8208;Heptagon&#8208;Embedded Wavy Polycyclic Heteroaromatics</title>

         <dc:description>
An intriguing bottom&#8208;up molecular engineering approach is revealed toward single&#8208;step synthesis of a novel class of double heptagon&#8208;containing N&#8208;rich laterally&#8208;fused stimuli&#8208;responsive polycyclic heteroarenes, leveraging a highly step&#8208;economic octuple C&#8722;H activation manifold for simultaneous creation of hexagon&#8208;containing planar and heptagon&#8208;containing nonplanar skeletons on readily available triazolium template.







Abstract
Curiosity&#8208;driven innovations on the design and synthesis of nonplanar polycyclic aromatic/heteroaromatic compounds with new molecular topologies unfold exciting opportunities for harnessing their intriguing supramolecular properties and thereby the development of novel functional organic materials. This work presents such an innovative synthetic concept of a bottom&#8208;up molecular topology engineering through a unique orchestrated octuple C&#8722;H activation reaction, toward the rapid synthesis of a novel class of double heptagon&#8208;incorporated nitrogen&#8208;doped laterally&#8208;fused polycyclic compounds with rarely reported wavy structural configuration. The profound impact of the molecular wavy structures of these compounds on their properties is manifested by weak and tunable solid&#8208;state intermolecular interactions controlling the electronic properties of the materials, leading to reversibly switchable fluorochromism in the solid state and thin films with mechanical force and solvent vapors as external stimuli, thereby indicating their potential applicability in rewritable fluorescent optical recording media, security papers, mechanosensors, volatile organic compound (VOC) sensors etc.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;breaking of Dibenzo[b,d]thiophene Sulfone Enhancing Polaron Generation for Boosted Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents BBTT&#8208;1SO, a novel acceptor unit designed by breaking the symmetry of dibenzo[b,d]thiophene sulfone (DBS). Its asymmetric structure enhances octapole moment and polarizability compared to DBS&#8208;containing counterparts. Transient spectroscopy demonstrates efficient generation of electron polarons in BBTT&#8208;1SO polymers, contributing to their superior hydrogen evolution rate compared to DBS&#8208;containing polymers.







Abstract
The current bottleneck in the development of efficient photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution is the limited availability of high&#8208;performance acceptor units. Over the past nine years, dibenzo[b,d]thiophene sulfone (DBS) has been the preferred choice for the acceptor unit. Despite extensive exploration of alternative structures as potential replacements for DBS, a superior substitute remains elusive. In this study, a symmetry&#8208;breaking strategy was employed on DBS to develop a novel acceptor unit, BBTT&#8208;1SO. The asymmetric structure of BBTT&#8208;1SO proved beneficial for increasing multiple moment and polarizability. BBTT&#8208;1SO&#8208;containing polymers showed higher efficiencies for hydrogen evolution than their DBS&#8208;containing counterparts by up to 166&#8201;%. PBBTT&#8208;1SO exhibited an excellent hydrogen evolution rate (HER) of 222.03&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and an apparent quantum yield of 27.5&#8201;% at 500&#8197;nm. Transient spectroscopic studies indicated that the BBTT&#8208;1SO&#8208;based polymers facilitated electron polaron formation, which explains their superior HERs. PBBTT&#8208;1SO also showed 14&#8201;% higher HER in natural seawater splitting than that in deionized water splitting. Molecular dynamics simulations highlighted the enhanced water&#8208;PBBTT&#8208;1SO polymer interactions in salt&#8208;containing solutions. This study presents a pioneering example of a substitute acceptor unit for DBS in the construction of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution.

         <title>Elevated Water Oxidation by Cation Leaching Enabled Tunable Surface Reconstruction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiFe0.25Cr1.75O4 with a spinel structure, activated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) conditioning, demonstrates superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity among NiFexCr2&#8208;xO4 homologue catalysts in alkaline conditions. The activation of the initially inactive spinel is due to surface reconstruction facilitated by Cr leaching, resulting in a core&#8211;shell structure with cation vacancies. This catalyst shows exceptional activity and stability in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) at 80&#8201;&#176;C in 1&#8197;M KOH.







Abstract
Water electrolysis is one promising and eco&#8208;friendly technique for energy storage, yet its overall efficiency is hindered by the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Therefore, developing strategies to boost OER catalyst performance is crucial. With the advances in characterization techniques, an extensive phenomenon of surface structure evolution into an active amorphous layer was uncovered. Surface reconstruction in a controlled fashion was then proposed as an emerging strategy to elevate water oxidation efficiency. In this work, Cr substitution induces the reconstruction of NiFexCr2&#8208;xO4 during cyclic voltammetry (CV) conditioning by Cr leaching, which leads to a superior OER performance. The best&#8208;performed NiFe0.25Cr1.75O4 shows a ~1500&#8201;% current density promotion at overpotential &#951;=300&#8197;mV, which outperforms many advanced NiFe&#8208;based OER catalysts. It is also found that their OER activities are mainly determined by Ni&#8201;:&#8201;Fe ratio rather than considering the contribution of Cr. Meanwhile, the turnover frequency (TOF) values based on redox peak and total mass were obtained and analysed, and their possible limitations in the case of NiFexCr2&#8208;xO4 are discussed. Additionally, the high activity and durability were further verified in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) cell, highlighting its potential for practical large&#8208;scale and sustainable hydrogen gas generation.

         <title>Engineering Ultrathin CuxS Layer on Planar Sb2S3 Photocathode to Enhance Photoelectrochemical Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a back contact for Sb2S3, an ultrathin CuxS layer has been successfully engineered for the first time to fabricate a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer Sb2S3/CuxS hole&#8208;transparent structure. With a substantial work function of 4.90&#8197;eV for CuxS layer, the transparent Sb2S3/CuxS platform enabled flexible integration of intricate catalyst layers at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface for efficient photoelectrochemical transformation.







Abstract
Sb2S3 has been extensively used as light absorber for photoelectrochemical cell. However, its p&#8208;type nature may result in the formation of Schottky junction with substrates, thus hindering the collection of photogenerated holes. Herein, an ultrathin CuxS layer is successfully engineered as the bottom junction for Sb2S3 for the first time. Capitalizing on its impressive electrical properties and superior optical properties, the CuxS layer exhibits a high work function of 4.90&#8197;eV, which causes the upward band bending of p&#8208;type Sb2S3, forming a hole&#8208;transparent structure with ohmic contact. The transparency of the ultrathin CuxS layer enables back&#8208;illumination of the Sb2S3/CuxS platform, facilitating the integration of intricate catalyst layers for photoelectrochemical transformation. When modified with Pt nanoparticles, the photocurrent density reaches &#8722;5.38&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0&#8197;V vs. RHE, marking a fourfold increase compared to the photocathode without CuxS layer. When introducing a molecular hybrid TC&#8208;CoPc@carbon black, a remarkable average photocurrent density of &#8722;0.44&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at the overpotential of 0&#8197;V is obtained for CO2 reduction reaction, while the photocurrent density is less than &#8722;0.03&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 without CuxS.

         <title>Opening and Constructing Stable Lithium&#8208;ion Channels within Polymer Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nowadays, the energy demand is increasing, so non&#8208;renewable resources are being consumed rapidly. Therefore, the need for renewable energy storage devices has become more urgent. SSLMBs eagerly evolve into small sizes, light mass, high energy density, good cycling performance, no memory effect, and environmental friendliness. However, the low ionic conductivity and poor interfacial contact hinder SSLMBs&#8217; practical application. In this paper, the flexible SPE of in situ polymerized PAAA opens and stabilizes the Li+ &#8242;highway&#8242; inside the SPE, enhancing Li+ transport, and the oxygen vacancies of SiO2 synergize with the substrate to bind the TFSI&#8722;, forming and transporting freer Li+, thus achieving high performance of SSLMBs at room temperature. This study provides ideas for the practical application of SSLMBs.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries play an integral role in various aspects of daily life, yet there is a pressing need to enhance their safety and cycling stability. In this study, we have successfully developed a highly secure and flexible solid&#8208;state polymer electrolyte (SPE) through the in situ polymerization of allyl acetoacetate (AAA) monomers. This SPE constructed an efficient Li+ transport channel inside and effectively improved the solid&#8208;solid interface contact of solid&#8208;state batteries to reduce interfacial impedance. Furthermore, it exhibited excellent thermal stability, an ionic conductivity of 3.82&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature (RT), and a Li+ transport number (tLi+) of 0.66. The numerous oxygen vacancies on layered inorganic SiO2 created an excellent environment for TFSI&#8722; immobilization. Free Li+ migrated rapidly at the C=O equivalence site with the poly(allyl acetoacetate) (PAAA) matrix. Consequently, when cycled at 0.5C and RT, it displayed an initial discharge specific capacity of 140.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a discharge specific capacity retention rate of 70&#8201;% even after 500 cycles. Similarly, when cycled at a higher rate of 5C, it demonstrated an initial discharge specific capacity of 132.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 while maintaining excellent cycling stability.
