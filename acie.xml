         <title>Tandem Electrochemical Oxidative Azidation/Heterocyclization of Tryptophan&#8208;Containing Peptides under Buffer Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As the aromatic tryptophan (Trp) side chain plays a pivotal role in influencing the structure and function of peptides and proteins, it has become an attractive target for the late&#8208;stage modification of these important biomolecules. In this work, we report an electrochemical approach for late&#8208;stage functionalization of peptides containing Trp side chain  via  manganese&#8208;catalyzed tandem radical azidation/heterocyclization. This electrochemical oxidative strategy provides access to azide&#8208;substituted tetrazolo[1,5&#8208;  a  ]indole&#8208;containing peptides with broad functional group tolerances, high site&#8208;selectivity, and good yields of products (up to 87%) under mild buffer conditions. Moreover, the modified Trp&#8208;containing peptides bearing azide functionality are promising building blocks, paving the way for the construction of various derivatives such as &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry products.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production on a sp2&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) have emerged as attractive platforms for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion. In this study, we have implemented a gradient heating strategy to synthesize a sp2&#8208;carbon&#8208;linked triazine&#8208;based COF, COF&#8208;JLU100, exhibiting high crystallinity, large surface area, good durability and carrier mobility for solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The Pt&#8208;doped COF&#8208;JLU100 demonstrated a high hydrogen evolution rate of over 100,000 &#181;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 for water splitting under visible&#8208;light illumination (&#955; &gt; 420 nm). Experimental and theoretical studies corroborate that the cyano&#8208;vinylene segments in COF&#8208;JLU100 extend the &#960;&#8208;delocalization and enable fast charge transfer and separation rates as well as good dispersion in water. Moreover, COF&#8208;JLU100 can be prepared by low&#8208;cost and easily available monomers and has excellent stability, which is desirable for practical solar&#8208;driven hydrogen production.</dc:description>

         <title>Be4B12+: A Covalently Bonded Archimedean Beryllo&#8208;Borospherene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new class of beryllium&#8208;boron clusters, beryllo&#8208;borospherene is reported herein theoretically. Boron motif undergoes drastic structural changes upon gradual beryllium doping in BenB12+ (n = 1&#8208;4) stoichiometries. The global minimum of the Be4B12+ cluster is a highly closed Archimedean beryllo&#8208;borospherene in a 2A1 electronic ground state, composed of four B3 triangles linked at each corner, resulting in a truncated tetrahedron with four B6 rings capped with four beryllium atoms. Beryllium can form strong bonding with boron clusters through strong electrostatic and covalent interaction. The bonding between a beryllium atom and Be3B12 unit is best described as a Be+ in a 2P excited state forming a strong and polarized electron&#8208;sharing bond with Be3B12 followed by several dative interactions by employing its vacant s, p, and very high&#8208;lying d orbitals. Counterintuitively, for an s&#8208;block element, the p orbitals of beryllium are the most crucial atomic orbitals for bonding rather than s orbitals.</dc:description>

         <title>1&#8201;:&#8201;1 Ca2+:Cu2+ A&#8208;site Order in a Ferrimagnetic Double Double Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CaCuFeReO6 adopts the tetragonal AA&#8242;BB&#8242;O6 double double perovskite structure that was previously only reported for A&#8242;=Mn compositions. Ferrimagnetic order of Fe, Re and Cu spins is observed at TC=567&#8197;K and the magnetoresistance displays low&#8208;field &#8220;butterfly&#8221; hysteresis with an unusual change from negative to positive values as field increases.







Abstract
Cation ordering in ABX3 perovskites is important to structural, physical and chemical properties. Here we report discovery of CaCuFeReO6 with the tetragonal AA&#8242;BB&#8242;O6 double double perovskite structure that was previously only reported for A&#8242;=Mn compositions. CaCuFeReO6 occurs in the same phase field as CaCu3Fe2Re2O12 demonstrating that different A&#8208;cation ordered peroskites may be obtained in the same chemical system. CaCuFeReO6 has ferrimagnetic order of Fe, Re and Cu spins below TC=567&#8197;K, in contrast to Mn analogues where the Mn spins order separately at much lower temperatures. The magnetoresistance of CaCuFeReO6 displays low&#8208;field &#8220;butterfly&#8221; hysteresis with an unusual change from negative to positive values as field increases. Many more AA&#8242;BB&#8242;O6 double double perovskites may be accessible for A&#8242;=Cu and other divalent transition metals at high pressure, so the presently known phases likely represent only the &#8220;tip of the iceberg&#8221; for this family.

         <title>Regioselective Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Arene C&#8722;H Borylations: From Directing Groups to Borylation Template Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From directing groups to borylation template reagents for transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free C&#8722;H borylation reactions: the use of a traceless directing group embedded into the borylation reagent opens attractive approaches for the regioselective C&#8722;H borylation of N&#8208;containing heteroarenes without requiring prior installation of directing groups at the scaffold.







Abstract
The latest developments in the field of electrophilic C&#8722;H borylation reactions of arenes and heteroarenes without transition metals are briefly overviewed, with a particular emphasis on the latest advances enabling the highly regioselective C&#8722;H borylations of indoles and indolines using borylation template reagents.

         <dc:description>
Water is utilized as benign electron&#8208;donor in photosynthesis, e.g. by cyanobacteria. Herein, a novel approach to shuttle them through the cyanobacterium's cell&#8208;membrane and to utilize them for extracellular NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent redox reactions is presented. The concept was demonstrated for 19 different reductive and oxidative enzymes from 4 different classes.







Abstract
Many biocatalytic redox reactions depend on the cofactor NAD(P)H, which may be provided by dedicated recycling systems. Exploiting light and water for NADPH&#8208;regeneration as it is performed, e.g. by cyanobacteria, is conceptually very appealing due to its high atom economy. However, the current use of cyanobacteria is limited, e.g. by challenging and time&#8208;consuming heterologous enzyme expression in cyanobacteria as well as limitations of substrate or product transport through the cell wall. Here we establish a transmembrane electron shuttling system propelled by the cyanobacterial photosynthesis to drive extracellular NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent redox reactions. The modular photo&#8208;electron shuttling (MPS) overcomes the need for cloning and problems associated with enzyme&#8208; or substrate&#8208;toxicity and substrate uptake. The MPS was demonstrated on four classes of enzymes with 19 enzymes and various types of substrates, reaching conversions of up to 99&#8201;% and giving products with &gt;99&#8201;% optical purity.

         <title>Cascades of Evolved Enzymes for the Synthesis of Complex Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of enzymes in multistep reaction cascades offers new opportunities for drug synthesis and is often shorter than their chemical synthesis routes, thus supporting the development of more sustainable and environmentally friendly processes. Recently, several cascades with evolved enzymes have been developed that have led to efficient synthetic pathways for highly complex molecules, thus pushing biocatalysis to a new level.







Abstract
Thanks to advances in enzyme discovery and protein engineering combined with the development of enzymatic multistep reaction cascades, new efficient routes for drug synthesis have been created that are superior to chemical syntheses. This supports the goal of the chemical and pharmaceutical industries to move to more sustainable and environmentally friendly processes. Recently described outstanding examples include the biocatalytic cascade syntheses of the cyclic dinucleotide MK&#8208;1454, molnupiravir, and islatravir, as well as the efficient fixation of CO2 to make starch using an artificial enzyme cascade.

         <title>What Matters for a European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grant?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Viewpoint Article provides tips on how to increase the chances of securing a European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grant.







Abstract
European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grants are arguably the most competitive grants in Europe and their prestige is fully justified considering that they (i) allow focus on a high risk/high gain project through generous funding of 1.5&#8211;2&#8197;million Euros, (ii) they can enable the foundation of a new academic group and earn the submitting principle investigator a professorship, and (iii) they serve as a highly reputable award that can either facilitate tenure/promotion or assist in securing a subsequent academic position. However, the journey to getting one is far from easy. In this Viewpoint Article, I will discuss my first two unsuccessful attempts to secure an ERC Starting Grant and how the lessons learned during the process led me to ultimately secure a grant upon my third attempt.

         <title>A Hybrid Antiperovskite with Strong Linear and Second&#8208;Order Nonlinear Optical Responses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antiperovskites have been studied since the 1980s because of their rich physical and chemical properties, but their linear and second&#8208;order nonlinear optical responses remain largely unknown. Here we report a new polar crystal, Cs3Cl(HC3N3S3) (I), which features a quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional antiperovskite structure composed of ClCs6  polyhedra and A&#8208;site [HC3N3S3]2&#8208;  rings. To our best knowledge, this kind of antiperovskite structure is reported for the first time. Remarkably,  I  exhibits a very strong nonlinear optical response up to 11.4 times that of the benchmark KH2PO4  and an exceptionally large birefringence of 0.52. The first&#8208;principles calculations and structural analyses reveal that [HC3N3S3]2&#8208;  is the &#8220;material gene&#8221; while the antiperovskite structural feature makes it in a favorable arrangement. This work provides a new structural platform for the rational design of integrated optoelectronic materials with linear and second&#8208;order nonlinear optical responses.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative Fluorination of Selenium and Tellurium Compounds using a Thermally Stable Phosphonium SF5&#8208; Salt Accessible from SF6</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated group 16 moieties are attractive building blocks in synthetic chemistry but only few synthetic methods are available to prepare them. Herein, we report a new oxidative fluorination reagent capable of stabilizing reactive fluorinated anions. It consists of an SF  5  &#8722;  anion and a chemically inert phosphonium cation and is exceptionally thermally stable. Accordingly, it was used to generate the SeF  5  &#8722;  and TeF  5  &#8722;  anions from the elemental chalcogens and to prepare the unknown tetrafluoro(phenyl)&#8208;&#955;  5  &#8208;selenates PhSeF  4  &#8722;  and &#8208;tellurates PhTeF  4  &#8722;  from the corresponding diphenyl dichalcogenides. In addition, we show that further derivatization of PhTeF  4  &#8722;  by oxidation to  trans  &#8208;PhTeF  4  O  &#8722;  and subsequent alkylation gives access to a new class of  trans  &#8208;(alkoxy)(phenyl)tetrafluoro&#8208;&#955;  6  &#8208;tellanes (  trans  &#8208;PhTeF  4  OR), thus providing an approach to introduce the functional group into organic molecules.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, an electroreductive carboxylation of organic carbon&#8208;halogen bonds (X = Br and Cl) promoted by catalytic amounts of naphthalene as an organic mediator is reported. This transformation proceeds smoothly under mild conditions with a broad substrate scope of 59 examples, affording the valuable and versatile carboxylic acids in moderate to excellent yields without the need of costly transition metal, wasted stoichiometric metal reductants, or sacrificial anodes. Further late&#8208;stage carboxylation of natural product and drug derivatives demonstrate its synthetic utility. Mechanistic studies confirmed the activation of carbon&#8208;halogen bonds  via  single&#8208;electron transfer and the key role of naphthalene in this reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic and Stereoselective Transformations with Easily Accessible and Purchasable Allyl and Alkenyl Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Torsional Strain&#8208;Independent Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Biaryl Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic asymmetric dynamic kinetic resolution of configurationally labile bridged biaryls is emerging as a powerful strategy for atropisomer synthesis. However, the reported examples suffer from an inherent challenge as the reactivity is highly dependent on the torsional strain of the biaryl substrates, which significantly narrows down the scope and hampers the application.  Herein, we report our discovery and development of a torsional strain&#8208;independent reaction between biaryl thionolactones and activated isocyanides. By employing auto&#8208;tandem silver catalysis, a universal synthesis of both  tri  &#8208; and  tetra  &#8208;  ortho  &#8208;substituted thiazole&#8208;containing biaryls was realized in high yields with high enantioselectivities. In addition, these products could be facilely converted to a novel type of bridged biaryls bearing an eight&#8208;membered lactone. Mechanistic studies were carried out to elucidate the cause of this unusual torsional strain&#8208;independent reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Hydrodefluorination of Electron&#8208;Rich Aryl Fluorides by an Anionic Rhodium&#8208;Gallium Photoredox Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An anionic Rh&#8722;Ga complex catalyzed the hydrodefluorination of challenging C&#8722;F bonds in electron&#8208;rich aryl fluorides and trifluoroarenes when irradiated with violet light in the presence of H  2  , a stoichiometric alkoxide base, and a crown&#8208;ether additive. Based on theoretical calculations, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), which is delocalized across both the Rh and Ga atoms, becomes singly occupied upon excitation, thereby poising the Rh&#8722;Ga complex for photoinduced single&#8208;electron transfer (SET). Stoichiometric and control reactions support that the C&#8722;F activation is mediated by the excited anionic Rh&#8208;Ga complex. After SET, the proposed neutral Rh(0) intermediate was detected by EPR spectroscopy, which matched the spectrum of an independently synthesized sample. Deuterium&#8208;labeling studies corroborate the generation of aryl radicals during catalysis and their subsequent hydrogen&#8208;atom abstraction from the THF solvent to generate the hydrodefluorinated arene products. Altogether, the combined experimental and theoretical data support an unconventional bimetallic excitation that achieves the activation of strong C&#8722;F bonds and uses H  2  and base as the terminal reductant.</dc:description>

         <title>Reimplementing Guest Shape Sorting of Nonporous Adaptive Crystals via Substituent&#8208;Size&#8208;Dependent Solid&#8208;Vapor Postsynthetic Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Postsynthetic modification (PSM) has been widely used in porous crystalline materials to gain better performance in adsorptive separation of gases or hydrocarbons. We here report that guest adsorption selectivity in a kind of nonporous crystalline materials, namely nonporous adaptive crystals (NACs), can be readily and precisely tuned via a facile substituent&#8208;size&#8208;dependent solid&#8208;vapor PSM method. Before PSM, NACs of pillar[4]arene[1]quinone  EtP4Q1  show negligible selectivity for C  5  hydrocarbons. PSM with a larger substituent, cyclopentylamine, onto  EtP4Q1  NACs does not improve the selectivity, while  EtP4Q1  NACs after PSM with a slightly smaller substituent, cyclobutylamine, is endowed with very high preference of  n  &#8208;pentane over cyclopentane. Comprehensive structural analyses confirm that the intermolecular interactions among the host compounds and host&#8722;guest interactions between the adsorbent and the adsorbate are the two major factors in determining the guest selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Modulated Release of a Cytotoxic Photosensitizer Using Photogenerated Reactive Oxygen Species and Glutathione</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reversible thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange chemistry is of particular interest in drug delivery systems. However, high levels of glutathione (GSH) in cancer cells are hardly distinguished from GSH in normal cells, resulting in unmanageable cytotoxic drug release. This study investigates the spatiotemporally&#8208;controlled irreversible degradation of Ir&#8208;based photosensitizer (TIr3)&#8208;encapsulating nanogels (IrNG) through the hyperoxidation of resulting intracellular thiols using reactive oxygen species (ROS). A highly cytotoxic TIr3 was stably encapsulated within IrNG through hydrophobic interactions and reversible crosslinking between its disulfide bonds and thiols in the absence of light, resulting in high biocompatibility under normal cellular conditions. However, upon photoirradiation, TIr3 generated high levels of ROS, irreversibly oxidizing the thiols to induce electrostatic repulsion between the polymer molecules, resulting in the TIr3 release and induction of cancer cell apoptosis.</dc:description>

         <title>HXV2O5 Nanocatalysts Combined with Ultrasound for Triple Amplification of Oxidative Stress to Enhance Cancer Catalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vanadium&#8208;based nanocatalysts (HVO) were constructed and employed as a novel biocatalyst for amplified tumor oxidative stress and enhanced cancer catalytic therapy. Such HVO nanocatalysts combined with ultrasound could triply boost tumor oxidative stress. The massive intracellular ROS would cause mitochondrial dysfunction, DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and cell proliferation inhibition, further realizing cancer cell death.







Abstract
Multiple amplification of tumor oxidative stress has been demonstrated as efficient strategy to enhance the reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated cancer therapy. Herein, vanadium&#8208;based nanocatalysts, hydrogen vanadium bronzes (HXV2O5, for short HVO), were constructed and employed as novel biocatalysts for amplifying tumor oxidative stress and enhancing cancer catalytic therapy. Such HVO nanocatalysts harboring multivalent V element possessed multi&#8208;functional catalytic activity in decomposing H2O2 into &#8901;OH and depleting endogenous glutathione (GSH) to dually amplify tumor oxidative stress. Meanwhile, HVO nanocatalysts could also be activated by ultrasound to further triply amplify oxidative stress. The massive intracellular ROS caused mitochondrial dysfunction, DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and cell proliferation inhibition, further realizing cancer cell death and tumor growth inhibition.

&lt;p&gt;Vanadium-based nanocatalysts (HVO) were constructed and employed as a novel biocatalyst for amplified tumor oxidative stress and enhanced cancer catalytic therapy. Such HVO nanocatalysts combined with ultrasound could triply boost tumor oxidative stress. The massive intracellular ROS would cause mitochondrial dysfunction, DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and cell proliferation inhibition, further realizing cancer cell death.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple amplification of tumor oxidative stress has been demonstrated as efficient strategy to enhance the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated cancer therapy. Herein, vanadium-based nanocatalysts, hydrogen vanadium bronzes (H&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, for short HVO), were constructed and employed as novel biocatalysts for amplifying tumor oxidative stress and enhancing cancer catalytic therapy. Such HVO nanocatalysts harboring multivalent V element possessed multi-functional catalytic activity in decomposing H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into &#8901;OH and depleting endogenous glutathione (GSH) to dually amplify tumor oxidative stress. Meanwhile, HVO nanocatalysts could also be activated by ultrasound to further triply amplify oxidative stress. The massive intracellular ROS caused mitochondrial dysfunction, DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and cell proliferation inhibition, further realizing cancer cell death and tumor growth inhibition. Collectively, HVO nanocatalysts highlight the remarkable value of ROS-mediated cancer therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Propelled Initiative Collision at Microelectrodes with Vertically Mobile Micromotors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocatalytic metal&#8211;organic framework micromotors with controllable vertical motion are applied to electrochemical impact measurements, which offer a possibility of exploring the dynamic interactions between the electrode and the particles and shed light on the design of new electrochemical sensors.







Abstract
Impact experiments enable single particle analysis for many applications. However, the effect of the trajectory of a particle to an electrode on impact signals still requires further exploration. Here, we investigate the particle impact measurements versus motion using micromotors with controllable vertical motion. With biocatalytic cascade reactions, the micromotor system utilizes buoyancy as the driving force, thus enabling more regulated interactions with the electrode. With the aid of numerical simulations, the dynamic interactions between the electrode and micromotors are categorized into four representative patterns: approaching, departing, approaching&#8208;and&#8208;departing, and departing&#8208;and&#8208;reapproaching, which correspond well with the experimentally observed impact signals. This study offers a possibility of exploring the dynamic interactions between the electrode and particles, shedding light on the design of new electrochemical sensors.

         <title>Autonomous Chiral Microswimmers with Self&#8208;mixing Capabilities for Highly Efficient Enantioselective Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;propelled microreactors producing chiral molecules with a high enantiomeric excess are proposed as a complementary approach with respect to classic stereoselective electroorganic synthesis. The straightforward concept is based on a spontaneous redox reaction occurring at the surface of zinc (micro)wires covered with chiral oligomers.







Abstract
The development of chiral catalysts plays a very important role in various areas of chemical science. Heterogeneous catalysts have the general advantage of allowing a more straightforward separation from the products. One specific case of heterogeneous catalysis is electrocatalysis, being potentially a green chemistry approach. However, a typical drawback is that the redox conversion of molecules occurs only at the electrode/electrolyte interface, and not in the bulk of the electrolyte. The second limitation is that the electrodes have to be physically connected to a power supply to induce the desired reactions. To circumvent these problems, we propose here a complementary approach by replacing macroscopic electrodes with an ensemble of self&#8208;propelled redox active microswimmers. They move autonomously in solution while transforming simultaneously a prochiral starting compound into a specific enantiomer with a very high enantiomeric excess, accompanied by a significantly increased production rate of the favorite enantiomer.

         <title>The Origin of High&#8208;Voltage Stability in Single&#8208;Crystal Layered Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The drastic H2/H3 phase transition and destructive H3b phase formation presented in PC electrode are effectively suppressed in SC cathodes when cycling at the high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6&#8197;V, in which the origin of excellent high&#8208;voltage stability in single&#8208;crystal was clearly clarified.







Abstract
Compared with the polycrystal (PC) Ni&#8208;rich cathode materials, the single&#8208;crystal (SC) counterpart displayed excellent structural stability, high reversible capacity and limited voltage decay during cycling, which received great attention from academics and industry. However, the origin of fascinating high&#8208;voltage stability within SC is poorly understood yet. Herein, we tracked the evolution of phase transitions, in which the destructive volume change and H3 phase formation presented in PC, are effectively suppressed in SC when cycling at a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6&#8197;V, further clarifying the origin of high&#8208;voltage stability in SC cathode. Moreover, SC electrode displayed crack&#8208;free morphology, and excellent electrochemical stability during long&#8208;term cycling, whereas PC suffered severe capacity and voltage fade because of the spinel&#8208;like phase, decoding the failure mechanisms of PC and SC during cycling at high cut&#8208;off voltages. This finding provides universal insights into high&#8208;voltage stability and failure mechanisms of layered Ni&#8208;rich cathode materials.

         <title>Molecular Electrochemical Reductive Splitting of Dinitrogen with a Molybdenum Complex
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N2 splitting is achieved with a simple Mo complex at a carbon electrode. Controlled reduction (a 3 electron transfer process) at &#8722;1.4&#8197;V (vs. SCE) and ambient conditions (room T and atmospheric P) afforded a Mo nitride complex in 30&#8201;% yield. DFT studies support the transient formation of a MoI&#8722;N2&#8208;MoI bridging dimer.







Abstract
Nitrogen reduction under mild conditions (room T and atmospheric P), using a non&#8208;fossil source of hydrogen remains a challenge. Molecular metal complexes, notably Mo based, have recently been shown to be active for such nitrogen fixation. We report electrochemical N2 splitting with a MoIII triphosphino complex [(PPP)MoI3], at room temperature and a moderately negative potential. A MoIV nitride species was generated, which is confirmed by electrochemistry and NMR studies. The reaction goes through two successive one electron reductions of the starting Mo species, coordination of a N2 molecule, and further splitting to a MoIV nitride complex. Preliminary DFT studies support the formation of a bridging MoIN2MoI dinitrogen dimer evolving to the Mo nitride via a low energy transition state. This example joins a short list of molecular complexes for N2 electrochemical reductive cleavage. It opens a door to electrochemical proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) conversion studies of N2 to NH3.

         <title>Intracellular Delivery of Glutathione Peroxidase Degrader Induces Ferroptosis In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small&#8208;molecule protein degrader based on the strategy of proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) was designed to deplete glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and regulate cancer cell ferroptosis. We demonstrate that a rationally designed GPX4 degrader, dGPX4 shows a five&#8208;fold enhancement of ferroptosis induction efficiency compared to that of GPX4 inhibition. Moreover, the intracellular delivery of dGPX4 using a novel type of biodegradable lipid nanoparticles (dGPX4@401&#8208;TK&#8208;12) induces ferroptosis in vivo to effectively suppress tumor growth without appreciable side effects.







Abstract
Ferroptosis is a new form of regulated, non&#8208;apoptotic cell death driven by iron&#8208;dependent phospholipid peroxidation. Its therapeutic potential is however, greatly limited by the low efficiency of regulating cell ferroptosis in vivo. Herein, we report a PROTAC&#8208;based protein degrader that depletes endogenous glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and induces cancer cell ferroptosis. We demonstrate that a rationally designed GPX4 degrader, dGPX4, can deplete tumor cell GPX4 via proteasomal protein degradation, showing a five&#8208;fold enhancement of ferroptosis induction efficiency compared to that of GPX4 inhibition using ML162. Moreover, we show that the intracellular delivery of dGPX4 using biodegradable lipid nanoparticles (dGPX4@401&#8208;TK&#8208;12) induces cell&#8208;selective ferroptosis by targeting cancer cell microenvironment. The in vivo administration of dGPX4@401&#8208;TK&#8208;12 effectively suppresses tumor growth without appreciable side effects. We anticipate the protein degradation strategy described herein could be easily expanded to other essential regulatory proteins of ferroptosis for developing targeted cancer therapeutics.

&lt;p&gt;A small-molecule protein degrader based on the strategy of proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) was designed to deplete glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and regulate cancer cell ferroptosis. We demonstrate that a rationally designed GPX4 degrader, dGPX4 shows a five-fold enhancement of ferroptosis induction efficiency compared to that of GPX4 inhibition. Moreover, the intracellular delivery of dGPX4 using a novel type of biodegradable lipid nanoparticles (dGPX4@401-TK-12) induces ferroptosis in vivo to effectively suppress tumor growth without appreciable side effects.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is a new form of regulated, non-apoptotic cell death driven by iron-dependent phospholipid peroxidation. Its therapeutic potential is however, greatly limited by the low efficiency of regulating cell ferroptosis in vivo. Herein, we report a PROTAC-based protein degrader that depletes endogenous glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and induces cancer cell ferroptosis. We demonstrate that a rationally designed GPX4 degrader, dGPX4, can deplete tumor cell GPX4 via proteasomal protein degradation, showing a five-fold enhancement of ferroptosis induction efficiency compared to that of GPX4 inhibition using ML162. Moreover, we show that the intracellular delivery of dGPX4 using biodegradable lipid nanoparticles (dGPX4@401-TK-12) induces cell-selective ferroptosis by targeting cancer cell microenvironment. The in vivo administration of dGPX4@401-TK-12 effectively suppresses tumor growth without appreciable side effects. We anticipate the protein degradation strategy described herein could be easily expanded to other essential regulatory proteins of ferroptosis for developing targeted cancer therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unblocking Ion&#8208;occluded Pore Channels in Poly(triazine imide) Framework for Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(triazine imide) or PTI is an ordered graphitic carbon nitride with nanoporous framework. However, pores in PTI are blocked by Li+ and halide ions, and a complete removal of ions leads to an impermeable AB stacking. We report an ion&#8208;exchange route which tunably opens pore channels while maintaining the AA&#8242; configuration leading to an improved proton conductivity.







Abstract
Poly(triazine imide) or PTI is an ordered graphitic carbon nitride hosting &#197;&#8208;scale pores attractive for selective molecular transport. AA&#8217;&#8208;stacked PTI layers are synthesized by ionothermal route during which ions occupy the framework and occlude the pores. Synthesis of ion&#8208;free PTI hosting AB&#8208;stacked layers has been reported, however, pores in this configuration are blocked by the neighboring layer. The unavailability of open pore limits application of PTI in molecular transport. Herein, we demonstrate acid treatment for ion depletion which maintains AA&#8217; stacking and results in open pore structure. We provide first direct evidence of ion&#8208;depleted open pores by imaging with the atomic resolution using integrated differential phase&#8208;contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy. Depending on the extent of ion&#8208;exchange, AA&#8217; stacking with open channels and AB stacking with closed channels are obtained and imaged for the first time. The accessibility of open channels is demonstrated by enhanced proton transport through ion depleted PTI.

         <title>An Activatable Near&#8208;Infrared Afterglow Theranostic Prodrug with Self&#8208;Sustainable Magnification Effect of Immunogenic Cell Death</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a theranostic prodrug that could self&#8208;report the drug release, immunogenic cell death (ICD) progression, and cold&#8208;to&#8208;hot tumor transformation with activated near&#8208;infrared afterglow chemiluminescence. Such an intelligent prodrug also shows a unique self&#8208; sustainable ICD magnification effect, completely eradicating the existing tumor and preventing further tumor recurrence through enhanced antitumor immune response.







Abstract
Herein, we report an activatable near&#8208;infrared (NIR) afterglow theranostic prodrug that circumvents high background noise interference caused by external light excitation. The prodrug can release hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) in response to the high intratumoral peroxynitrite level associated with immunogenic cell death (ICD), and synchronously activate afterglow signal to monitor the drug release process and cold&#8208;to&#8208;hot tumor transformation. The prodrug itself is an ICD inducer achieved by photodynamic therapy (PDT). PDT initiates ICD and recruits first&#8208;arrived neutrophils to secrete peroxynitrite to trigger HCPT release. Intriguingly, we demonstrate that HCPT can significantly amplify PDT&#8208;mediated ICD process. The prodrug thus shows a self&#8208;sustainable ICD magnification effect by establishing an &#8220;ICD&#8208;HCPT release&#8208;amplified ICD&#8221; cycling loop. In vivo studies demonstrate that the prodrug can eradicate existing tumors and prevent further tumor recurrence through antitumor immune response.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Blue Electroluminescence of Perovskites with Reduced Dimensionality Achieved by Manipulating Adsorption&#8208;Energy Differences</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we have exemplified the critical role of adsorption&#8208;energy differences in the structural regulation of reduced&#8208;dimensional perovskites by complementing theoretical calculations and experiments. As a result, we achieved deep&#8208;blue PeLED peaking at 457&#8197;nm with a record EQE of 4.62&#8201;% accompanied by stablly electroluminescent spectra. Our findings provide a way for PeLEDs to develop their full technological potential.







Abstract
The lagging development of deep&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) heavily impedes their practical applications in full&#8208;color display due to the absence of spectrally stable emitters and the mismatch of carrier injection capacity. Herein, we report highly efficient deep&#8208;blue PeLEDs through a new chemical strategy that addresses the dilemma for simultaneously constant electroluminescence (EL) spectra and high&#8208;purify phase in reduced&#8208;dimensional perovskites. The success lies in the control of adsorption&#8208;energy differences between phenylbutylamine (PBA) and ethylamine (EA) interacting with perovskites, which facilitates narrow n&#8208;value distribution. This approach leads to an increased exciton binding energy and enhanced surface potential, hence improving radiative recombination. As a result, an external quantum efficiency of 4.62&#8201;% is achieved in PeLEDs with a stable EL peak at 457&#8197;nm, demonstrating the best reported result for deep&#8208;blue PeLEDs so far.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Indium&#8208;Copper Dual&#8208;Metal Active Sites Promoting C&#8722;C Coupling for CO2 Photoreduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed In&#8722;Cu metal pairs anchored on polymeric carbon nitride catalysts (InCu/PCN) were designed and produced by a facile thermal polymerization approach to support photocatalytic CO2 reduction to ethanol. The metal pairs exert synergistic interactions that enhance the activity and adsorption of metal sites to promote C&#8722;C coupling and subsequent formation of ethanol.







Abstract
Photoreduction of CO2 to C2+ solar fuel is a promising carbon&#8208;neutral technology for renewable energy. This strategy is challenged by its low productivity due to low efficiency in multielectron utilization and slow C&#8722;C coupling kinetics. This work reports a dual&#8208;metal photocatalyst consisting of atomically dispersed indium and copper anchored on polymeric carbon nitride (InCu/PCN), on which the photoreduction of CO2 delivered an excellent ethanol production rate of 28.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a high selectivity of 92&#8201;%. Coupled experimental investigation and DFT calculations reveal the following mechanisms underpinning the high performance of this catalyst. Essentially, the In&#8722;Cu interaction enhances the charge separation by accelerating charge transfer from PCN to the metal sites. Indium also transfers electrons to neighboring copper via Cu&#8722;N&#8722;In bridges, increasing the electron density of copper active sites. Furthermore, In&#8722;Cu dual&#8208;metal sites promote the adsorption of *CO intermediates and lower the energy barrier of C&#8722;C coupling.

A surface modification method without UV assistance is reported for in situ growing hydrogel coatings onto diverse substrates regardless of material size, geometry, and transparency. This strategy takes advantage of the synergy among the catechol adhesion mechanism, coordination to metal ions and its unique redox reactivity for interface polymerization, providing a simple and universal route for surface modification.







Abstract
Growing lubricating hydrogel coatings in controllable manners on diverse material surfaces demonstrates promising applications. Here, a surface modification method is reported for in situ growing hydrogel coatings onto surfaces of diverse substrates in the absence of UV assistance. It is performed by decorating substrates with a universal mussel&#8208;inspired synthetic adhesive with catechol groups. Upon being immersed in reaction solution, these groups can assist substrate bonding and in situ capture and reduce Fe3+ into Fe2+ for decomposing S2O82&#8722; into SO4&#8722;. catalytically at the interface to initiate interface polymerization of monomers. As a result, hydrogel coatings with controllable thickness could be grown on surfaces of arbitrary substrates to change their surface characteristics regardless of materials size, category, geometry and transparency, implying considerable potential in surface engineering.

         <title>Directly Imaging Dynamic Electronic Coupling during Electrochemical Oxidation of Single Silver Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
During electrochemical oxidation processes, a dip behavior for single Ag nanoparticles on Au electrodes is directly visualized using a monochromatic bright field imaging technique. This observation can be attributed to interfacial Au&#8722;Ag electronic coupling interactions, which are manifested as the heterogeneity of electrochemical activity of individual Ag nanoparticles.







Abstract
The electronic coupling between a metal electrode and single nano&#8208;entities is of unfading significance which impacts the heterogeneous electron transfer. Herein, we demonstrated a simple optical technique for directly imaging the transient interfacial electronic coupling events during electrochemical oxidation of single Ag nanoparticles on Au electrode. The electronic coupling brings out a dramatic dip behavior of bright field imaging traces, and is conductive to cross the energy barrier of oxidation for single silver nanoparticles. This dip behavior is further verified by in situ vis&#8208;transmission spectroscopy, and the heterogeneity of the Au&#8722;Ag electronic coupling down to single&#8208;nanoparticle level is uncovered by unifying the morphology and size of individual silver nanoparticles. These results suggest the interfacial electronic coupling facilitates electron transfer of single nanoparticles, and provide important insight into understanding detailed mechanism of nanoelectrochemistry.

         <title>A Rebuilding&#8208;Free Nucleic Acid Detection Strategy Enables Ultrasensitive Genotyping, N&#8208;in&#8208;1 Logic Screening and Accurate Multiplex Assay of Dangerous Pathogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>

Abstract
Sensitive, rapid and low&#8208;cost nucleic acid detection is critical for controlling infectious pathogens. Here, we develop a ready&#8208;to&#8208;use and multimodal detection based on a rebuilding&#8208;free, ultrasensitive and selective strategy named dual hairpin ligation&#8208;induced isothermal amplification pro (DHLApro). Taking influenza A, influenza B, MERS&#8208;CoV, SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 as model targets, we demonstrate DHLApro provides &#8776;zM level ultra&#8208;sensitivity, being equaling to 0.45&#8197;copy/&#956;L in original sample. By simply changing the recognition module, a set of DHLApro components can be applied to a new target without performance loss. Moreover, DHLApro innovatively allows flexible logic/multiplex assay using one set of primer, for example, the &#8220;N pathogens&#8208;in&#8208;1&#8221; OR gate screening and accurate multi&#8208;channel multiplex assay. Compared with traditional methods, the cost of this logic/multiplex assay has been largely reduced and the cross&#8208;interference between the multiple primer sets is also avoided.

         <title>Calix[4]pyrrolato Stibenium: Lewis Superacidity by Antimony(III)&#8208;Antimony(V) Electromerism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When the calix[4]pyrrolato stibenium cation is treated with pyridine, a Lewis&#8208;base coordination&#8208;induced electromerism transforms the low&#8208;affinity stibenium to a high&#8208;affinity stibonium state. The generated transient stibonium ion readily reacts with SbF6&#8722; and illustrates a Lewis superacid that can be triggered by electromerism.







Abstract
Lewis superacids enable the activation of highly inert substrates. However, the permanent presence of a Lewis superacidic center comes along with a constantly increased intolerance toward functional groups or ambient conditions. Herein, we describe a strategy to unleash Lewis superacidity by electromerism. Experimental and computational results indicate that coordinating a Lewis base to &#916;&#8208;calix[4]pyrrolato&#8208;antimony(III) triggers a ligand redox&#8208;noninnocent coupled transfer into antimony(V)&#8208;state that exhibits Lewis superacidic features. Lewis acidity by electromerism establishes a concept of potential generality for powerful yet robust reagents and on&#8208;site substrate activation approaches.

         <dc:description>
We present an activatable virus&#8208;mimicking NIR&#8208;II nanoprobe based on PbS quantum dots (QDs) encapsulated in a Fe2+&#8208;coordinating viral protein&#8208;decorated vesicle. The probe can cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier and monitor real&#8208;time changes in reactive oxygen and nitrogen species concentrations during viral infection, providing a favorable approach for dynamic visualization of viral encephalitis.







Abstract
Viral encephalitis is an inflammatory disease of the brain parenchyma and caused by various viral infections. In vivo monitoring of the progression of viral infections can aid accurate diagnosis of viral encephalitis and effective intervention. We developed an activatable and reversible virus&#8208;mimicking near&#8208;infrared II nanoprobe consisting of an Fe2+&#8208;coordinated, viral protein&#8208;decorated vesicle encapsulating PbS quantum dots with a 1300&#8197;nm fluorescence emission. The probe can cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier and monitor real&#8208;time changes in reactive oxygen and nitrogen species concentrations during viral infection by tuning the quenching level of quantum dots and regulating the fusion&#8211;fission behavior of vesicles via changes in Fe oxidation state. This switching strategy reduces background noise and improves detection sensitivity, making this nanoprobe a promising imaging agent for dynamic visualization of viral encephalitis and future clinical applications.

         <title>Radical Hydro&#8208;Fluorosulfonylation of Unactivated Alkenes and Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical hydro&#8208;fluorosulfonylation of olefins has been successfully achieved by employing FABI as a FSO2&#8208;radical precursor and ODA as an organic photocatalyst. With this photocatalytic system, radical hydro&#8208;fluorosulfonylation of alkynes can also be realized with a unique, high Z&#8208;selectivity. Utilization of this method is further demonstrated in the late&#8208;stage modification of natural products and drug ligation chemistry.







Abstract
Recently, radical fluorosulfonylation is emerging as an appealing approach for the synthesis of sulfonyl fluorides, which are highly in demand in various disciplines, particularly in chemical biology and drug discovery. Here, we report the first establishment of radical hydro&#8208;fluorosulfonylation of alkenes, which is enabled by using 1&#8208;fluorosulfonyl 2&#8208;aryl benzoimidazolium (FABI) as an effective redox&#8208;active radical precursor. This method provides a new and facile approach for the synthesis of aliphatic sulfonyl fluorides from unactivated alkenes, and can be further applied to the late&#8208;stage modifications of natural products and peptides, as well as ligation of drugs in combination with click chemistry. Remarkably, this system could enable the radical hydro&#8208;fluorosulfonylation of alkynes, affording valuable alkenylsulfonyl fluoride products with a rare, high Z&#8208;selectivity, which are normally less stable and more challenging to synthesize in comparison with the E&#8208;configured products.

&lt;p&gt;Radical hydro-fluorosulfonylation of olefins has been successfully achieved by employing FABI as a FSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-radical precursor and ODA as an organic photocatalyst. With this photocatalytic system, radical hydro-fluorosulfonylation of alkynes can also be realized with a unique, high &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-selectivity. Utilization of this method is further demonstrated in the late-stage modification of natural products and drug ligation chemistry.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, radical fluorosulfonylation is emerging as an appealing approach for the synthesis of sulfonyl fluorides, which are highly in demand in various disciplines, particularly in chemical biology and drug discovery. Here, we report the first establishment of radical hydro-fluorosulfonylation of alkenes, which is enabled by using 1-fluorosulfonyl 2-aryl benzoimidazolium (FABI) as an effective redox-active radical precursor. This method provides a new and facile approach for the synthesis of aliphatic sulfonyl fluorides from unactivated alkenes, and can be further applied to the late-stage modifications of natural products and peptides, as well as ligation of drugs in combination with click chemistry. Remarkably, this system could enable the radical hydro-fluorosulfonylation of alkynes, affording valuable alkenylsulfonyl fluoride products with a rare, high &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-selectivity, which are normally less stable and more challenging to synthesize in comparison with the &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;-configured products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>pH&#8208;Induced Symmetry Conversion of DNA Origami Lattices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic motifs, like i&#8208;motif sequence, can be inserted into prescribed dimensions through strict dimensional manipulation strategy, to trigger in situ reversible expansion and shrinkage in 3D DNA origami frameworks.







Abstract
DNA nanotechnology has provided credible approaches for assembly of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) lattices with complex patterns. However, the symmetries are strictly dependent on their initial configurations and difficult to alter via non&#8208;thermal treatments. While switchable nucleic acid structures have been employed to construct deformable DNA motifs, it remains challenging to arrange them anisotropically in 3D lattices to trigger directed collective shape transition and dynamic symmetry conversion. In this work, we used octahedral DNA origami frames to synthesize four DNA origami lattices by placing the pH&#8208;reactive i&#8208;motif sequences in the desired dimensions. Thereinto, lattices with an anisotropic design can switch between simple cubic (SC) and simple tetragonal (ST) upon pH change. Small angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) results reveal the feasibility of obtaining 3D lattices with sensitive responses to external stimuli, expanding the way to obtain low&#8208;symmetry lattices.

         <title>Low&#8208;temperature Water&#8208;gas Shift Reaction Enhanced by Oxygen Vacancies in Pt&#8208;loaded Porous Single&#8208;crystalline Oxide Monoliths</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we create and stabilize oxygen vacancies in the Pt&#8208;loaded porous single crystalline molybdenum oxide monolith and demonstrate efficient and durable low temperature water&#8208;gas shift reaction.







Abstract
Water&#8208;gas shift (WGS) reaction at low temperature plays an important role in hydrogen production from fossil fuels and hydrogen purification for proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells. However, the activation of H2O is a critical reaction step that greatly limits the overall performance during WGS reaction. Here we fabricate porous single&#8208;crystalline (PSC) MoO3 monoliths at 1&#8197;cm scale and deposit atomic&#8208;layered Pt clusters at the lattice surface to create the interfacial system toward the low&#8208;temperature WGS reaction. The single&#8208;crystalline nature stabilizes the oxygen vacancies (VO) at lattice and facilitates the effective activation of H2O at the interface. We show the highest Pt&#8208;normalized activity of 0.86&#8197;molCO&#8201;molPt&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 for the ultra&#8208;low temperature WGS reaction at 120&#8201;&#176;C. The single&#8208;crystalline features with enhanced fluxion in porous architectures lead to outstanding performance without visible degradation even after continuous operation for 100&#8197;hours.

         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarizes recent advances in the application of nano&#8208; and microstructured Janus materials, which are a new generation of heterogeneous catalysts for various chemical reactions. Such materials can act as catalysts for reduction, oxidative desulfurization, dye degradation, asymmetric catalysis, biomass transformation, cascade reactions, oxidation, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions, electro&#8208; and photocatalytic reactions, and gas&#8208;phase reactions.







Abstract
Janus materials are anisotropic nano&#8208; and microarchitectures with two different faces consisting of distinguishable or opposite physicochemical properties. In parallel with the discovery of new methods for the fabrication of these materials, decisive progress has been made in their application, for example, in biological science, catalysis, pharmaceuticals, and, more recently, in battery technology. This Minireview systematically covers recent and significant achievements in the application of task&#8208;specific Janus nanomaterials as heterogeneous catalysts in various types of chemical reactions, including reduction, oxidative desulfurization and dye degradation, asymmetric catalysis, biomass transformation, cascade reactions, oxidation, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions, electro&#8208; and photocatalytic reactions, as well as gas&#8208;phase reactions. Finally, an outlook on possible future applications is given.

         <title>Semisynthesis of Homogeneous, Active Granulocyte Colony&#8208;Stimulating Factor Glycoforms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four variants of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G&#8208;CSF) were prepared via semisynthesis. A new PEGylated photocleavable linker enabled quantitative glycosylation of the C&#8208;terminal fragment and selenocysteine&#8208;based ligation as well as expressed protein selenoester ligation helped to overcome solubility issues.







Abstract
Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G&#8208;CSF) is a cytokine used to treat neutropenia. Different glycosylated and non&#8208;glycosylated variants of G&#8208;CSF for therapeutic application are currently generated by recombinant expression. Here, we describe our approaches to establish a first semisynthesis strategy to access the aglycone and O&#8208;glycoforms of G&#8208;CSF, thereby enabling the preparation of selectively and homogeneously post&#8208;translationally modified variants of this important cytokine. Eventually, we succeeded by combining selenocysteine ligation of a recombinantly produced N&#8208;terminal segment with a synthetic C&#8208;terminal part, transiently equipped with a side&#8208;chain&#8208;linked, photocleavable PEG moiety, at low concentration. The transient PEGylation enabled quantitative enzymatic elongation of the carbohydrate at Thr133. Overall, we were able to significantly reduce the problems related to the low solubility and the tendency to aggregate of the two protein segments, which allowed the preparation of four G&#8208;CSF variants that were successfully folded and demonstrated biological activity in cell proliferation assays.

         <title>Oxalate Oxidase for In Situ H2O2&#8208;Generation in Unspecific Peroxygenase&#8208;Catalysed Drug Oxyfunctionalisations
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;throughput &#956;L&#8208;scale screenings revealed optimal conditions for in situ H2O2&#8208;generation using oxalate oxidase in bioconversions catalysed by unspecific peroxygenase. This enzymatic tandem exhibits extraordinary potential for selective C&#8722;H oxyfunctionalisation reactions of complex drug scaffolds.







Abstract
H2O2&#8208;driven enzymes are of great interest for industrial biotransformations. Herein, we show for the first time that oxalate oxidase (OXO) is an efficient in situ source of H2O2 for one of these biocatalysts, which is known as unspecific peroxygenase (UPO). OXO is reasonably robust, produces only CO2 as a by&#8208;product and uses oxalate as a cheap sacrificial electron donor. UPO has significant potential as an industrial catalyst for selective C&#8722;H oxyfunctionalisations, as we confirm herein by testing a diverse drug panel using miniaturised high&#8208;throughput assays and mass spectrometry. 33 out of 64 drugs were converted in 5&#8197;&#956;L&#8208;scale reactions by the UPO with OXO (conversion &gt;70&#8201;% for 11 drugs). Furthermore, oxidation of the drug tolmetin was achieved on a 50&#8197;mg scale (TONUPO 25&#8201;664) with 84&#8201;% yield, which was further improved via enzyme immobilization. This one&#8208;pot approach ensures adequate H2O2 levels, enabling rapid access to industrially relevant molecules that are difficult to obtain by other routes.

Herein, we show for the first time that oxalate oxidase (OXO) is an efficient in situ source of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for one of these biocatalysts, which is known as unspecific peroxygenase (UPO). OXO is reasonably robust, produces only CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a by-product and uses oxalate as a cheap sacrificial electron donor. UPO has significant potential as an industrial catalyst for selective C&#8722;H oxyfunctionalisations, as we confirm herein by testing a diverse drug panel using miniaturised high-throughput assays and mass spectrometry. 33 out of 64 drugs were converted in 5&#8197;&#956;L-scale reactions by the UPO with OXO (conversion &amp;gt;70&#8201;% for 11 drugs). Furthermore, oxidation of the drug tolmetin was achieved on a 50&#8197;mg scale (TON&lt;sub&gt;UPO&lt;/sub&gt; 25&#8201;664) with 84&#8201;% yield, which was further improved via enzyme immobilization. This one-pot approach ensures adequate H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels, enabling rapid access to industrially relevant molecules that are difficult to obtain by other routes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Isolation and Reactivity of Tetrylene&#8208;Tetrylone&#8208;Iron Complexes Supported by Bis(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Imine) Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The germanium and tin iron carbonyl complexes were prepared by the reaction of dimeric chloro(imino)tetrylenes [IPrNECl]2 (E=Ge, Sn; IPrN=bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;iminato) with one equivalent of Na2Fe(CO)4 at room temperature. Besides, a Li/Sn/Fe trimetallic complex was isolated by the reaction of chloro(imino)stannylene with cyclopentadienyl iron dicarbonyl anion.







Abstract
The germanium iron carbonyl complex 3 was prepared by the reaction of dimeric chloro(imino)germylene [IPrNGeCl]2 (IPrN=bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;iminato) with one equivalent of Collman's reagent (Na2Fe(CO)4) at room temperature. Similarly, the reaction of chloro(imino)stannylene [IPrNSnCl]2 with Na2Fe(CO)4 (1&#8197;equiv) resulted in the Fe(CO)4&#8208;bridged bis(stannylene) complex 4. We observed reversible formation of bis(tetrylene) and tetrylene&#8208;tetrylone character in complexes 3 vs. 5 and 4 vs. 6, which was supported by DFT calculations. Moreover, the Li/Sn/Fe trimetallic complex 12 has been isolated from the reaction of [IPrNSnCl]2 with cyclopentadienyl iron dicarbonyl anion. The computational analysis further rationalizes the reduction pathway from these chlorotetrylenes to the corresponding complexes.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale View of Protein&#8208;PEG Interactions that Redirect the Thermal Unfolding Pathway of PEGylated Human Galectin&#8208;3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PEGylation of the carbohydrate recognition domain of human Galectin&#8208;3 dramatically redirected the protein thermal unfolding pathway. NMR spectroscopy showed PEG localized to the protein surface consistent with a &#8220;shroud&#8221; molecular model. Subtle changes in the PEG localization and corresponding thermal unfolding profiles were realized by replacing lysines near the protein&#8208;PEG interface.







Abstract
PEGylation is a promising approach to address the central challenge of applying biologics, i.e., lack of protein stability in the demanding environment of the human body. Wider application is hindered by lack of atomic level understanding of protein&#8208;PEG interactions, preventing design of conjugates with predicted properties. We deployed an integrative structural and biophysical approach to address this critical challenge with the PEGylated carbohydrate recognition domain of human galectin&#8208;3 (Gal3C), a lectin essential for cell adhesion and potential biologic. PEGylation dramatically increased Gal3C thermal stability, forming a stable intermediate and redirecting its unfolding pathway. Structural details revealed by NMR pointed to a potential role of PEG localization facilitated by charged residues. Replacing these residues subtly altered the protein&#8208;PEG interface and thermal unfolding behavior, providing insight into rationally designing conjugates while preserving PEGylation benefits.

         <title>High&#8208;Humidity Shaker Aging to Access Chitin and Cellulose Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nature&#8217;s potential in affording functional biomaterials is often hindered by extraction conditions. To isolate nanocrystalline domains in polysaccharides high solvent usage is warranted while low reactivity and yields are also limiting factors. In this report, the first solvent&#8208;free pathway to access carboxylated chitin and cellulose nanocrystals with excellent mass balance is described, relying on a new method coined high&#8208;humidity shaker aging (HHSA). The method involves a brief and mild grinding of the polysaccharide with ammonium persulfate followed by an aging phase under high&#8208;humidity and on a shaker plate. Insights into the mechanism were uncovered, which highlighted the unique role of high humidity to afford a gradual uptake of water by the material up to deliquescence when the reaction is complete. This process was then validated for direct synthesis of nanocrystals from biomass sources including crab and soft wood pulp.</dc:description>

         <title>Decarboxylative Sulfinylation Enables a Direct, Metal&#8208;Free Access to Sulfoxides from Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intermediate oxidation state of sulfoxides is central to the plethora of their applications in chemistry and medicine, yet it presents challenges for an efficient synthetic access, limiting the structural diversity of currently available sulfoxides. Here, we report a data&#8208;guided development of direct decarboxylative sulfinylation that enables the previously inaccessible functional group interconversion of carboxylic acids to sulfoxides in a reaction with sulfinates. Given the broad availability of carboxylic acids and the growing synthetic potential of sulfinates, the direct decarboxylative sulfinylation is poised to improve the structural diversity of synthetically accessible sulfoxides. The reaction is facilitated by a kinetically favored sulfoxide formation from the intermediate sulfinyl sulfones, despite the strong thermodynamic preference for the sulfone formation, unveiling the previously unknown and chemoselective radicalophilic sulfinyl sulfone reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Prussian Blue Analogues and Their Oxide Family as Sulfur Hosts for&#160;Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of high&#8208;entropy into Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) has yet to attract attention in the field of lithium&#8208;sulfur battery materials.  Herein,  we systematically synthesize a library of PBAs from binary to high&#8208;entropy by a facile coprecipitation method.  The coordination environment in PBAs is explored by X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, which together with elemental mapping confirm the successful introduction of all metals. Importantly, electrochemical tests demonstrate  that high&#8208;entropy PBA can serve as polysulfide immobilizer to inhibit shuttle effect and as catalyst to promote polysulfides conversion, thereby boosting its outstanding performance.  Additionally, a variety of  nano  cubic  metal oxides from binary to senary are fabricated by using PBAs as sacrificial precursors. We believe that a wide range of new materials obtained from our  coprecipitation  and pyrolysis methodology can promote further developments in research on PBA systems and sulfur hosts.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Imaging of Ion Motion in a Single Nanoparticle: Structural Transformations in Selenium Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intraparticle ion motions are critical to the structure and properties of nanomaterials, but rarely disclosed. Herein, in&#8208;situ visualization of ion motions in a single nanoparticle is presented by dark&#8208;field microscopy imaging, which shows HgCl2&#8208;induced structural transformation of amorphous selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) with the main composition of Se8. Owing to the high binding affinity with selenium and coulomb interactions, Hg2+ ions can permeate into the interior of SeNPs, making the amorphous Se8 turn to polycrystalline Hg3Se2Cl2. As a proof of concept, SeNPs then serve as a highly effective scavenger for selective removal of Hg2+ ions from solution. This new finding offers visual proof for the photophysical process involving intraparticle ion motion, demonstrating that tracking the ion motions is a novel strategy to comprehend the formation mechanism with the purpose of developing new nanostructures like nanoalloys and nano metal compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrophobicity directed chiral self&#8208;assembly and aggregation induced emission: Diacetylene&#8208;cored pseudopeptide chiral dopants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we delineate simple and tunable hydrophobically driven chiral functional assemblies of diacetylene cored pseudopeptides. These amino acid appended, rigid core dialkynes constitute promising chiral supramolecular building blocks for materials properties engineering. The chiral appended amino acid elements allow for simple tuning of solubility and interaction properties as well as governing chirality, while the central dialkyne core can impart hydrophobically driven assembly and Aggregation Induced Emission (AIE) properties. The self&#8208;assembly of these rod&#8208;like dialkynes can be regulated by tuning the solvent environment, with for example self&#8208;assembly into vesicles in acetonitrile and into helical organization with AIE in a H  2  O/DMSO mixture. Of additional high interest, these supramolecular materials, themselves devoid of liquid crystal (LC) properties, can induce chirality into non&#8208;chiral LC matrices with high helical twisting power.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold&#8208;doping effect on two&#8208;photon absorption and luminescence of atomically precise silver ligated nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Noble metal nanoclusters allow for the atomically&#8208;precise control of their composition. However, to create nanoclusters with pre&#8208;defined optical properties, comprehensive description of their structure&#8208;property relation is required. Here, we report the gold atom doping impact on one&#8208;photon and two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) and luminescence properties of ligated silver nanoclusters via combined experimental studies and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory simulations (TD&#8208;DFT). We synthesized a series of Ag25&#8208;xAux(DMBT)18 nanoclusters where x=0, 1 and 5&#8208;10. For Ag24Au1(DMBT)18 we demonstrate that the presence of the central Au dopant strongly influences linear and non&#8208;linear optical properties, increasing photoluminescence quantum yield and two&#8208;photon brightness, with respect to undoped silver nanoclusters. With improved TPA and luminescence, atomically&#8208;precise AuAg alloys presented in our work can serve as robust luminescent probes e.g. for bioimaging in the second biological window.</dc:description>

         <title>Spontaneous Decomposition of an Extraordinarily Twisted and Trans&#8208;Bent Fully&#8208;Phosphanyl&#8208;Substituted Digermene to an Unusual GeI Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of a fully phosphanyl&#8208;substituted digermene, {(Mes)2P}2Ge=Ge{P(Mes)2}2 (3), exhibits a uniquely distorted Ge=Ge double bond. Unexpectedly, 3 is unstable in solution, decomposing to a novel GeI cluster (7).







Abstract
Ditetrelenes R2E=ER2 (E=Si, Ge, Sn, Pb) substituted by multiple N/P/O/S&#8208;donor groups are extremely rare due to their propensity to disaggregate into their tetrylene monomers R2E. We report the synthesis of the first fully phosphanyl&#8208;substituted digermene {(Mes)2P}2Ge=Ge{P(Mes)2}2 (3, Mes=2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2), which adopts a highly unusual structure in the solid state, that is both strongly trans&#8208;bent and highly twisted. Variable&#8208;temperature 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopy suggests that 3 persists in solution, but is subject to a dynamic equilibrium between two conformations, which have different geometries about the Ge=Ge bond (twisted/non&#8208;twisted) due to a difference in the nature of their &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions. Compound 3 undergoes unprecedented, spontaneous decomposition in solution to give a unique GeI cluster {(Mes)2P}4Ge4&#8901;5&#8201;CyMe (7).

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Driven Photoredox Catalysis by Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Complex Nanodots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aggregation of transition metal complexes (TMCs) into nanodots generates redshifted and broadened absorption covering the visible and the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region compared with the individual molecular complexes. The TMC nanodots demonstrate excellent performance for the carbonylation reaction under solar&#8208;light illumination.







Abstract
Developing light&#8208;harvesting materials with broad spectral response is of fundamental importance in full&#8208;spectrum solar energy conversion. We found that, when a series of earth&#8208;abundant metal (Cu, Co, Ni and Fe) salts are dissolved in coordinating solvents uniformly dispersed nanodots (NDs) are formed rather than fully dissolving as molecular species. The previously unrecognized formation of this condensed state is ascribed to spontaneous aggregation of molecular transition&#8208;metal&#8208;complexes (TMCs) via weak intermolecular interactions, which results in redshifted and broadened absorption into the NIR region (200&#8211;1100&#8197;nm). Typical photoredox reactions, such as carbonylation and oxidative dehydrogenation, well demonstrate the feasibility of efficient utilization of NIR light (&#955;&gt;780&#8197;nm) by TMCs NDs. Our finding provides a conceptually new strategy for extending the absorption towards low energy photons in solar energy harvesting and conversion via photoredox transformations.

         <title>An Anticancer Rhenium Tricarbonyl Targets Fe&#8208;S Cluster Biogenesis in Ovarian Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Target identification remains a critical challenge in inorganic drug discovery to deconvolute potential polypharmacology. Here, we describe an improved approach to prioritize candidate protein targets based on a combination of dose&#8208;dependent chemoproteomics and treatment effects in living cancer cells for the rhenium tricarbonyl compound TRIP. Chemoproteomics revealed 89 distinct dose&#8208;dependent targets with concentrations of competitive saturation between 0.1&#8211;32&#160;&#181;M despite the broad proteotoxic effects of TRIP. Target response networks revealed two highly probable targets of which the Fe&#8208;S cluster biogenesis factor NUBP2 was competitively saturated by free TRIP at nanomolar concentrations. Importantly, TRIP treatment led to a down&#8208;regulation of Fe&#8208;S cluster&#8208;containing proteins and upregulated ferritin. Fe&#8208;S cluster depletion was further verified by assessing mitochondrial bioenergetics. Consequently, TRIP emerges as a first&#8208;in&#8208;class modulator of the scaffold protein NUBP2, which disturbs Fe&#8208;S cluster biogenesis at sub&#8208;cytotoxic concentrations in ovarian cancer cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;Limaspermidine and (&#8211;)&#8208;Kopsinine by a Nitroaryl Transfer Cascade Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report an intramolecular conjugate addition/Truce&#8211;Smiles/E1cb cascade of 2&#8208;nitrobenzenesulfonamide&#8208;functionalized cyclohexenones as a new entry to the core scaffold of monoterpene indole alkaloids. The method was applied to the asymmetric total synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;limaspermidine, (&#8211;)&#8208;kopsinilam, and (&#8211;)&#8208;kopsinine, as well as the framework of the kopsifoline alkaloids, thus highlighting its complementarity to existing approaches involving the use of indole&#8208;based starting materials or the interrupted Fischer indole synthesis. Furthermore, we show that the cascade tolerates various substituents on the nitroarene, opening the way to other natural products as well as non&#8208;natural analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8211;Uptake Relationship Study of DABCYL Derivatives Linked to Cyclic Cell&#8208;Penetrating Peptides for Live&#8208;Cell Delivery of Synthetic Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modifying cyclic cell&#8208;penetrating deca&#8208;arginine (cR10) peptides with 4&#8208;(4&#8208;dimethylaminophenylazo)benzoic acid (DABCYL) improves the uptake efficiency of synthetic ubiquitin (Ub) cargoes into living cells. In order to probe the role of the DABCYL moiety, we performed time&#8208;lapse microscopy and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) of fluorescent DABCYL&#8208;R10 to evaluate the impact on cell entry by the formation of nucleation zones. Furthermore, we performed a structure&#8208;uptake relationship study with thirteen DABCYL derivatives coupled to CPP to examine their effect on the cell&#8208;uptake efficiency when conjugated to mono&#8208;Ub via disulfide linkages. Our results show that through structure variations of the DABCYL alone we could reach, at nanomolar concentration, an additional threefold increase in the cytosolic delivery of Ub, which will enable studies on various intracellular processes related to Ub signaling.</dc:description>

         <title>Ion Adsorption and Desorption at the CaF2&#8208;Water Interface Probed by Flow Experiments and Vibrational Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dissolution of minerals in contact with water plays a crucial role in geochemistry. However, obtaining molecular insight into interfacial chemistry is challenging. Dissolution typically involves the release of ions from the surface, giving rise to a charged mineral surface. This charge affects the interfacial water arrangement, which can be investigated by surface&#8208;specific vibrational Sum Frequency Generation (v&#8208;SFG) spectroscopy. For the fluorite&#8208;water interface, recent spectroscopic studies concluded that fluoride adsorption/desorption determines the surface charge, which contrasts zeta potential measurements assigning this role to the calcium ion. By combining v&#8209;SFG spectroscopy and flow experiments with systematically suppressed dissolution, we uncover the interplay of dominant fluoride and weak calcium adsorption/desorption, resolving the controversy in the literature. We infer the calcium contribution to be orders of magnitude smaller, emphasizing the sensitivity of our approach.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract  : While the range of accessible borylenes has significantly broadened over the last decade, applications remain limited. Herein, we present tricoordinate oxy&#8208;borylenes as potent photoreductants that can be readily activated by visible light. Facile oxidation of CAAC stabilized oxy&#8208;borylenes (CAAC)(IPr  2  Me  2  )BOR (R = TMS, CH  2  CH  2  C  6  H  5  , CH  2  CH  2  (4&#8208;F)C  6  H  4  ) to their corresponding radical cations is achieved with mildly oxidizing ferrocenium ion. Cyclovoltammetric studies reveal ground&#8208;state redox potentials of up to &#8211;1.90 V vs. Fc/Fc  +  for such oxy&#8208;borylenes placing them among the strongest organic super electron donors. Their ability as photoreductants is further supported by theoretical studies and showcased by the application as stoichiometric reagents for the photochemical hydrodehalogenation of aryl chlorides, aryl bromides and unactivated alkyl bromides as well as the detosylation of anilines.</dc:description>

         <title>Dibenzo[b,f][1,4,5]chalcogenadiazepine Photoswitches: Conversion of Excitation Energy into Ring Strain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetra&#8208;  ortho  &#8208;substituted, heteroaryl and cyclic azobenzenes have emerged as three key strategies on morphology design of photoswitch to diversify controllability. Cyclic azobenzene is of particular utilization in photo&#8208;energy conversion due to rigid and ring&#8208;strain structure. Despite the well&#8208;recognized diazocine, the photo&#8208;switching properties of seven&#8208;membered cyclic azobenzenes (diazepines) have yet been exploited. Herein, we report a family of dibenzo[  b,f  ][1,4,5]chalcogenadiazepines (DBChDs) and their T&#8208;type photo&#8208;switching nature with tunable relaxation rate. Based on experiments together with DFT calculations, we found that an unsymmetric 2&#8208;bithiophenyl&#8208;dibenzo[  b,f  ][1,4,5]thiadiazepine exhibited an efficient response to 445 nm laser stimulation (quantum efficiency, &#934;  Z  &#8594;E  = 0.71) with millisecond relaxation half&#8208;life (  t  1/2  = 40 ms). Photo&#8208;energy transduction efficiency was also exceptionally high with 29.1% converted into ring&#8208;strain energy mainly loaded on azo &#960;&#8208;bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Thallusin for Bioactivity Profiling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully stereocontrolled synthesis of the algae differentiation factor (&#8722;)&#8208;thallusin was achieved by employing a 6&#8208;endo&#8208;cyclization and effective late&#8208;stage sp2&#8211;sp2&#8208;coupling using non&#8208;toxic reagents. Quantitative phenotype profiling in the alga Ulva mutabilis gave an EC50 of 4.8&#8197;pM. SAR investigations of derivatives uncovered two functionally distinct chemical mediator functions.







Abstract
Chemical mediators are key compounds for controlling symbiotic interactions in the environment. Here, we disclose a fully stereoselective total synthesis of the algae differentiation factor (&#8722;)&#8208;thallusin that utilizes sophisticated 6&#8208;endo&#8208;cyclization chemistry and effective late&#8208;stage sp2&#8211;sp2&#8208;couplings using non&#8208;toxic reagents. An EC50 of 4.8&#8197;pM was determined by quantitative phenotype profiling in the green seaweed Ulva mutabilis (Chlorophyte), underscoring this potent mediator&#8216;s enormous, pan&#8208;species bioactivity produced by symbiotic bacteria. SAR investigations indicate that (&#8722;)&#8208;thallusin triggers at least two different pathways in Ulva that may be separated by chemical editing of the mediator compound structure.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Reaction of Pentafluorosulfanyl Chloride, Alkenes and Diazo Compounds and Synthesis of Pentafluorosulfanylfurans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;component radical reaction of SF5Cl, alkenes, and diazo compounds for synthesis of &#945;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;SF5 carbonyl compounds was developed. Furthermore, the three&#8208;component adducts formed from SF5Cl, &#945;&#8208;diazoacetophenones and vinyl acetates were converted into pentafluorosulfanylfurans.







Abstract
We report herein the three&#8208;component radical addition reaction of SF5Cl, alkene and diazo compounds for the selective formation of &#945;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;SF5 carbonyl compounds. The three&#8208;component addition reaction proceeded through the first reaction of SF5 radical with the diazo compound followed by the addition of the in situ generated carbon radical to alkene. The synthetic useful &#945;&#8208;allyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;SF5 carbonyl compounds were successfully prepared when allyl trimethylsilanes were used as the alkene substrates. Furthermore, the three&#8208;component adducts formed from SF5Cl, &#945;&#8208;diazoacetophenones and vinyl acetates were converted into pentafluorosulfanylfurans. This transformation provided a practical and efficeint method for the synthesis of pentafluorosulfanylfurans.

         <title>Unravelling the Mechanistic Pathway of the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Driven by a Cobalt Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CoI complex bearing a redox&#8208;active &#954;&#8208;N3P2 pentadentate ligand and its activity towards hydrogen evolution reaction is reported in this work. A combination of spectroscopic, electrochemical and computational techniques is employed to characterize the intermediate species, demonstrating an unusual homolytic coupling reaction pathway between two catalyst units.







Abstract
A cobalt complex bearing a &#954;&#8208;N3P2 ligand is presented (1+ or CoI(L), where L is (1E,1&#8242;E)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;(pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diyl)bis(N&#8208;(3&#8208;(diphenylphosphanyl)propyl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;imine). Complex 1+ is stable under air at oxidation state CoI thanks to the &#960;&#8208;acceptor character of the phosphine groups. Electrochemical behavior of 1+ reveals a two&#8208;electron CoI/CoIII oxidation process and an additional one&#8208;electron reduction, which leads to an enhancement in the current due to hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at Eonset=&#8722;1.6&#8197;V vs Fc/Fc+. In the presence of 1&#8197;equiv of bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide, 1+ forms the cobalt hydride derivative CoIII(L)&#8208;H (22+), which has been fully characterized. Further addition of 1&#8197;equiv of CoCp*2 (Cp* is pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) affords the reduced CoII(L)&#8208;H (2+) species, which rapidly forms hydrogen and regenerates the initial CoI(L) (1+). The spectroscopic characterization of catalytic intermediates together with DFT calculations support an unusual bimolecular homolytic mechanism in the catalytic HER with 1+.

         <title>Competitive Adsorption: Reducing the Poisoning Effect of Adsorbed Hydroxyl on Ru Single&#8208;Atom Site with SnO2 for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Ru SAs&#8208;SnO2/C elecotrocatalyst with low OHad poisoning effect to Ru sites was demonstrated by the competition adsorption strategy. It exhibited excellent HER activity owing to the fast OHad transfer process (OHad+e&#8722;&#8651;OH&#8722;, the key step of Vomer step), which alleviated the poisoning of OHad on Ru sites and facilitate regeneration of Ru active sites.







Abstract
Ruthenium (Ru) has been theoretically considered a viable alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalyst due to its fast water dissociation kinetics. However, its strong affinity to the adsorbed hydroxyl (OHad) blocks the active sites, resulting in unsatisfactory performance during the practical HER process. Here, we first reported a competitive adsorption strategy for the construction of SnO2 nanoparticles doped with Ru single&#8208;atoms supported on carbon (Ru SAs&#8208;SnO2/C) via atomic galvanic replacement. SnO2 was introduced to regulate the strong interaction between Ru and OHad by the competitive adsorption of OHad between Ru and SnO2, which alleviated the poisoning of Ru sites. As a consequence, the Ru SAs&#8208;SnO2/C exhibited a low overpotential at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (10&#8197;mV) and a low Tafel slope of 25&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1. This approach provides a new avenue to modulate the adsorption strength of active sites and intermediates, which paves the way for the development of highly active electrocatalysts.

         <title>Small&#8208;Molecule&#8208;based Supramolecular Plastics Mediated by Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) was driven by the non&#8208;covalent association of a disulfide bond linked azobenzene macrocycle with negative charges and a small cationic surfactant. The LLPS resulted in three&#8208;dimensional supramolecular plastic materials that were highly adhesive at high water content and, tough and stretchable at low water content. The resulting materials were also reusable and highly recyclable.







Abstract
Plastics are one of the most widely used polymeric materials. However, they are often undegradable and non&#8208;recyclable due to the very stable covalent bonds of macromolecules, causing environmental pollution and health problems. Here, we report that liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) could drive the formation of robust, stable, and sustainable plastics using small molecules. The LLPS process could sequester and concentrate solutes, strengthen the non&#8208;covalent association between molecules and produce a bulk material whose property was highly related to the encapsulated water amounts. It was a robust plastic with a remarkable Young's modulus of 139.5&#8197;MPa when the water content was low while became adhesive and could instantly self&#8208;heal with more absorbed water. Finally, responsiveness enabled the material to be highly recyclable. This work allowed us to understand the LLPS at the molecular level and demonstrated that LLPS is a promising approach to exploring eco&#8208;friendly supramolecular plastics that are potential substitutes for conventional polymers.

         <title>Lipid Mass Tags via Aziridination for Probing Unsaturated Lipid Isomers and Accurate Relative Quantification
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aziridine&#8208;based isobaric labeling strategy is developed for lipid accurate relative quantification, isomer identification, and ionization efficiency improvement. This strategy allows multiplex analysis without using lipid internal standards and characterization of lipid double&#8208;bond positional isomers. We envision it will accelerate the discovery of lipid biomarkers for early disease diagnosis, progression monitoring, and therapeutic response prediction.







Abstract
Knowing concentrations of lipids is essential for understanding their physiological functions and discovering new disease biomarkers. However, it is highly challenging to accurately quantify lipids due to structural diversity and multiple isomeric forms of lipids. To address these critical gaps, we have developed a novel aziridine&#8208;based isobaric tag labelling strategy that allows (i) determination of lipid double&#8208;bond positional isomers, (ii) accurate relative quantification of unsaturated lipids, and (iii) improvement of ionization efficiencies of nonpolar lipids. The power of this method is demonstrated in characterization and quantification of various categories of lipids such as fatty acids, phosphoglycerol lipids, cholesteryl esters (CE), and glycerides. 17 CE lipid isomers were identified and quantified simultaneously from Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse serum without using lipid standards. Among them, 6 CE isomers showed significant changes in concentrations in AD serum.

         <title>sp&#8208;Carbon Incorporated Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Framework as Photocathode for Photoelectrochemical Hydrogen Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first sp&#8208;carbon incorporated 2D c&#8208;MOF (Cu3HHAE2) single crystals are achieved based on the hexahydroxyarylene&#8208;ethynyl macrocycle ligand. Owing to the abundant acetylene units, Cu3HHAE2 acts as the first example of a MOF photocathode for highly efficient photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen generation.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted increasing interest for broad applications in catalysis and gas separation due to their high porosity. However, the insulating feature and the limited active sites hindered MOFs as photocathode active materials for application in photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen generation. Herein, we develop a layered conductive two&#8208;dimensional conjugated MOF (2D c&#8208;MOF) comprising sp&#8208;carbon active sites based on arylene&#8208;ethynylene macrocycle ligand via CuO4 linking, named as Cu3HHAE2. This sp&#8208;carbon 2D c&#8208;MOF displays apparent semiconducting behavior and broad light absorption till the near&#8208;infrared band (1600&#8197;nm). Due to the abundant acetylene units, the Cu3HHAE2 could act as the first case of MOF photocathode for photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen generation and presents a record hydrogen&#8208;evolution photocurrent density of &#8776;260&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode among the structurally&#8208;defined cocatalyst&#8208;free organic photocathodes.

         <title>Ketenes in the Induction of the Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Olefins Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Operando synchrotron photoelectron photoion coincidence (PEPICO) spectroscopy identifies ketene and methylketene intermediates in methyl acetate conversion over the HZSM&#8208;5 zeolite. The surface acetyl to olefins mechanism proceeds via methylation and decarbonylation processes.







Abstract
Ketene (CH2=C=O) has been postulated as a key intermediate for the first olefin production in the zeolite&#8208;catalyzed chemistry of methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefins (MTO) and syngas&#8208;to&#8208;olefins (STO) processes. The reaction mechanism remains elusive, because the short&#8208;lived ethenone ketene and its derivatives are difficult to detect, which is further complicated by the low expected ketene concentration. We report on the experimental detection of methylketene (CH3&#8722;CH=C=O) formed by the methylation of ketene on HZSM&#8208;5 via operando synchrotron photoelectron photoion coincidence (PEPICO) spectroscopy. Ketene is produced in situ from methyl acetate. The observation of methylketene as the ethylene precursor evidences a computationally predicted ketene&#8208;to&#8208;ethylene route proceeding via a methylketene intermediate followed by decarbonylation.

&lt;p&gt;Ketene (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=C=O) has been postulated as a key intermediate for the first olefin production in the zeolite-catalyzed chemistry of methanol-to-olefins (MTO) and syngas-to-olefins (STO) processes. The reaction mechanism remains elusive, because the short-lived ethenone ketene and its derivatives are difficult to detect, which is further complicated by the low expected ketene concentration. We report on the experimental detection of methylketene (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;CH=C=O) formed by the methylation of ketene on HZSM-5 via operando synchrotron photoelectron photoion coincidence (PEPICO) spectroscopy. Ketene is produced in situ from methyl acetate. The observation of methylketene as the ethylene precursor evidences a computationally predicted ketene-to-ethylene route proceeding via a methylketene intermediate followed by decarbonylation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective para&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H Functionalization of Alkyl Benzene Derivatives via Cooperative Catalysis of Gold/Chiral Br&#248;nsted Acid
</title>

         <dc:description>
An asymmetric para&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H bond functionalization of non&#8208;activated arenes via cooperative catalysis is disclosed. The strategy merges gold and chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) in the synthesis of a variety of chiral diaryl esters with high site&#8208; and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
An asymmetric para&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H bond functionalization of alkyl benzene derivatives was successfully developed via cooperative catalysis of gold and chiral phosphoric acid (CPA), leading to synthetically useful chiral 1,1&#8208;diaryl motifs. Chiral phosphoric acid, ligand, and molecular sieves were found to be crucial for enantioselectivity control of this transformation. The salient features of this protocol include mild conditions, high efficiency, commercially available starting materials, highly chemo&#8208; and site&#8208; as well as enantioselective aromatic C&#8722;H functionalization, broad substrate scope, and extensive applications of the chiral products. The mechanistic studies suggested that two CPAs might be involved in chiral induction.

         <title>Towards Hexagonal Planar Nickel: A Dispersion&#8208;Stabilised Tri&#8208;Lithium Nickelate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homoleptic tri&#8208;lithium nickelates can be readily prepared from simple precursors, but despite exhibiting a hexagonal planar geometry according to solid&#8208;state parameters, complementary bonding analysis reveals that the Li&#8722;Ni interactions are repulsive in nature. London dispersion interactions between the TMEDA donor and aryl&#8208;acetylide ligands are found to be crucial in the stabilisation and isolation of these complexes.







Abstract
Advancing the understanding of lithum nickelate complexes, here we report a family of homoleptic organonickelate complexes obtained by reacting Ni(COD)2 and lithium aryl&#8208;acetylides in the presence of the bidentate donor TMEDA. These compounds represent rare examples of low&#8208;valent transition&#8208;metals supported solely by organolithium ligands. Whilst the solid&#8208;state structures indicate a hexagonal planar geometry around Ni0 with Ni&#8722;Li bonds, bonding analysis via QTAIM, NCI, NBO and ELI methods reveals that the Ni&#8722;Li interactions are repulsive in nature, characterising these complexes as tri&#8208;coordinated. London dispersion forces between TMEDA and the organic substituents on nickel are found to play a crucial role in the stabilisation and thus isolation of these complexes. Preliminary reactivity studies demonstrate that the homoleptic lithium nickelates undergo stoichiometric cross&#8208;coupling with PhI to give dinickel clusters containing both anionic acetylide and neutral alkyne ligands.

A new type of nitrogen&#8208;centered polycyclic scaffold with a unique combination of 5&#8208;, 6&#8208;, and 7&#8208;membered rings and appealing properties was synthesized through 3&#8208;fold oxidative cyclodehydrogenation of tri(1&#8208;naphthyl)amine. Theoretical mechanistic studies suggested the formation of this unusual compound to occur under kinetic control via a dicationic mechanism.







Abstract
We describe a new type of nitrogen&#8208;centered polycyclic scaffold comprising a unique combination of 5&#8208;, 6&#8208;, and 7&#8208;membered rings. The compound is accessible through an intramolecular oxidative cyclodehydrogenation of tri(1&#8208;naphthyl)amine. To the best of our knowledge this is the very first example of a direct 3&#8208;fold cyclization of a triarylamine under oxidative conditions. The unusual ring fusion motif is confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography and the impact of cyclization on the electronic and photophysical properties is investigated both experimentally and theoretically based on density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations. The formation of the unexpected product is rationalized by detailed mechanistic studies on the DFT level. The results suggest the cyclization to occur under kinetic control via a dicationic mechanism.

         <title>Efficient Gene Silencing in Intact Plant Cells Using siRNA Delivered By Functional Graphene Oxide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report that graphene oxide nanoparticles (GONs) can be used to deliver small interfering RNA (siRNA) into intact plant cells by forming a small, near&#8208;spheroidal GONs&#8208;siRNA complex. The GONs&#8208;siRNA complex could cross the intact cell wall and internalize into plant cells, resulting in highly efficient and transient gene silencing. This provides an efficient, transient, simple, and safe strategy for plant gene engineering.







Abstract
Delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) to intact plants for gene silencing mainly relies on viral vectors and Agrobacterium&#8208;mediated transformation due to the barrier of intact plant cell wall. Here, we reported that polymer functionalized graphene oxide nanoparticles (GONs) enable siRNA transfer into intact plant cells and bring about efficient gene silencing. We found that sheeted GONs could efficiently load siRNA to form small sized, near&#8208;spheroidal GONs&#8208;siRNA complex, which could be across the cell wall and internalize in the plant cell. The GONs&#8208;siRNA exhibited transient and strong silencing (97.2&#8201;% efficiency) in plant tissues at 24&#8197;h after treatment and returned to normal level at 5&#8197;days after treatment. This method has the obvious advantages of efficient, transient, simple, stability and well biocompatibility, which should greatly stimulate the application of nanomaterials as gene&#8208;engineering tools in plant research.

         <title>Green and Scalable Fabrication of High&#8208;Performance Biocatalysts Using Covalent Organic Frameworks as Enzyme Carriers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ assembly of enzymes and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) enables the environmentally benign large&#8208;scale fabrication of a new generation of high&#8208;performance biocatalysts. This approach shows how limitations in enzyme immobilization can be overcome and it opens up a new avenue for the scalable fabrication of high&#8208;performance biocatalysts to accelerate enzyme industrialization.







Abstract
Enzyme immobilization is essential to the commercial viability of various critical large&#8208;scale biocatalytic processes. However, challenges remain for the immobilization systems, such as difficulties in loading large enzymes, enzyme leaching, and limitations for large&#8208;scale fabrication. Herein, we describe a green and scalable strategy to prepare high&#8208;performance biocatalysts through in situ assembly of enzymes with covalent organic frameworks (COFs) under ambient conditions (aqueous solution and room temperature). The obtained biocatalysts have exceptional reusability and stability and serve as efficient biocatalysts for important industrial reactions that cannot be efficiently catalyzed by free enzymes or traditional enzyme immobilization systems. Notably, this versatile enzyme immobilization platform is applicable to various COFs and enzymes. The reactions in an aqueous solution occurred within a short timeframe (ca. 10&#8211;30&#8197;min) and could be scaled up readily (ca. 2.3&#8197;g per reaction).

         <title>Unravelling the Reactivity of Framework Lewis Acid Sites towards Methanol Activation on H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite with Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the acid sites on zeolites is vital for the establishment of catalyst structure&#8208;activity and exploration of their potential applications in heterogeneous catalysis. Here, we report the identification of active framework Lewis acid sites on ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites. The structures of framework&#8208;associated tri&#8208;coordinated Al that is bonding with hydroxyl groups are determined by using one&#8208; dimensional (1D) 31P and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) 31P&#8208;{27Al} NMR spectroscopy of trimethylphosphine oxide probe molecule. 2D 13C&#8208;{27Al} NMR correlation experiments allow the observation of favorable formation of methoxy species on the framework&#8208;associated Al Lewis acid sites in methanol reaction at low temperature, which is corroborated by density functional theory calculations. These methoxy species contribute to the further conversion of methanol to hydrocarbons as active C1 species. The results provide new insights into the Lewis acidity of zeolites.</dc:description>

         <title>A Single&#8208;Atom Cobalt Catalyst for the Fluorination of Acyl Chlorides at Parts&#8208;per&#8208;Million Catalyst Loading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Improving the stability of sensitive catalytic systems is an emerging research topic in the catalysis field. However, the current design of heterogeneous catalysts mainly improves their catalytic performance. This paper presents a single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) strategy to improve the cobalt&#8208;catalysed fluorination of acyl chlorides. A stable Co&#8211;F intermediate can be formed through the oxidative fluorination of Co1&#8211;N4@NC SAC, which can replace the unstable high&#8208;valent cobalt catalytic system and avoid the use of phosphine ligands. In the SAC system, KF can be employed as a fluorinating reagent to replace the AgF, which can be applied to various substrates and scale&#8208;up conversion with high turnover numbers (TON= 1.58 &#215; 106). This work also shows that inorganic SACs have tremendous potential for organofluorine chemistry, and it provides a good reference for the follow&#8208;up studies on the structure&#8211;activity relationship between catalyst design and chemical reaction mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Substrate&#8208;Rhodium Cooperativity in Photoinduced ortho&#8208;Alkynylation of Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the realm of metallaphotocatalytic C&#8722;H activation strategy, the direct excitation of the transition metal which plays the dual role of light energy harnessing alongside performing the bond breaking and forming is a rare phenomenon. In this context we have developed the first photo&#8208;induced Rh&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8208;alkynylation under ambient conditions without the requirement of silver salt, photocatalyst (PC) or any engineered substrate or catalyst. The transformation functions by the specific cooperative effect of a six&#8208;membered rhodacycle which is the photo&#8208;responsive species. The catalytic system allows the conjugation of arenes with sp  3  &#8208;rich pharmacophoric fragments. The control experiments as well as the computational studies resolve the mechanistic intricacies for this transformation. An outer sphere electron transfer process from Rh to alkynyl radical is operative for the present photo&#8208;induced transformation over the more common oxidative addition or 1,2&#8208;migratory insertion pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Assisted Reversible Migratory Coupling of Aminoborane at Magnesium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A combined synthetic and theoretical investigation of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) adducts of magnesium amidoboranes is presented, which involves a rare example of reversible migratory insertion within a normal valent&#160;  s  &#8208;block element  . The reaction of (NHC)Mg(N(SiMe  3  )  2  )  2  &#160;(  1  ) and dimethylamine borane yields the tris(amide) adduct (NHC&#8208;BN)Mg(NMe  2  BH  3  )(N(SiMe  3  )  2  ) (  2  ; NHC&#8208;BN = NHC  &#8211;  BH  2  NMe  2  ). In addition to Me  2  N=BH  2&#160;  capture at the&#160;  NHC  C&#8211;Mg bond, mechanistic investigations suggest the likelihood of aminoborane migratory insertion from an RMg(NMe  2  BH  2  NMe  2  BH  3  ) intermediate. To elucidate these processes, the carbene complexes (NHC)Mg(NMe  2  BH  3  )  2  (  8  ) and (NHC)Mg(NMe  2  BH  2  NMe  2  BH  3  )  2  &#160;(  9  ) were synthesized, and a dynamic migration of Me  2  N=BH  2  &#160;between Mg&#8211;N and&#160;  NHC  C&#8211;Mg bonds was observed in&#160;  9  . This unusual reversible migratory insertion is presumably induced by dissimilar charge localization in the &#713;{NMe  2  BH  2  NMe  2  BH  3  } anion, as well as the capacity of NHCs to reversibly capture Me  2  N=BH  2  &#160;in the presence of Lewis acidic magnesium species.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of triangulene and its derivatives is challenging due to their intrinsic high spin nature. Herein, we report solutionphase synthesis and isolation of a nitrogen&#8208;doped triangulene (i.e., aza&#8208;triangulene) (  NT  ) and its cation (  NT  +  ) in single&#8208;crystal form. Notably, the cation  NT  +  can be regarded as an isoelectronic structure of the corresponding all&#8208;carbon triangulene. Both  NT  and  NT  +  showed reasonable stability due to kinetic blocking by bulky and electron&#8208;withdrawing aryl substituents, and intramolecular donoracceptor interaction. Bond length analysis, magnetic measurements and theoretical calculations reveal that the neutral  NT  has a doublet ground state with a zwitterionic character, while the cation  NT  +  exhibits a triplet ground state with a singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap of +0.84 kcal/mol. This study provides a rational strategy to access high&#8208;spin systems by heteroatom doping of pure &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycyclic hydrocarbons.</dc:description>

         <title>Multistate Circularly Polarized Luminescence Switching through Stimuli&#8208;induced Co&#8208;conformation Regulations of Pyrene&#8208;functionalized Topologically Chiral [2]Catenane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aiming at the construction of novel circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) switches with multiple switchable emission states and high dissymmetry factors (glum), topologically chiral [2]catenanes were employed as the key platform to construct a novel multistate CPL switching system. Taking advantage of the precise co&#8208;conformation regulations of the resultant pyrene&#8208;functionalized [2]catenanes under different external stimuli, reversible transformations between three emission states with different CPL performances,  i.e.  the initial "closed"&#160;form with a |glum| value of 0.012, the "open" form with an almost complete turn&#8208;off of CPL emission, and the "protonated"&#160;form with a boosted |glum| value of 0.022, were successfully realized. This study demonstrates the successful construction of not only the first topological chirality&#8208;based CPL switch, but also a novel bidirectional CPL switch, thus providing a promising platform for the construction of novel chiral materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface boron modulation on cobalt oxide nanocrystals for electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we show that coupling boron with cobalt oxide tunes its structure and significantly boost its electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Through a simple precipitation and thermal treatment process, a series of Co&#8208;B oxides with tunable morphologies and textural parameters were prepared. Detailed structural analysis supported first the formation of an disordered and partially amorphous material with nanosized Co3BO5 and/or Co2B2O6 being present on the local atomic scale. The boron modulation resulted in a superior OER reactivity by delivering a large current and an overpotential of 338 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA/cm2 in 1M KOH electrolyte. Identical location transmission electron microscopy and in situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy studies revealed alteration and surface re&#8208;construction of materials, and formation of CoO2 and (oxy)hydroxide intermediate, which were found to be highly dependent on crystallinity of the samples.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymerisation&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly of Graft Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the polymerisation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly of poly(lauryl methacrylate)&#8208;graft&#8208;poly(benzyl methacrylate) copolymers during reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT)&#160;grafting from&#160;polymerisation in a backbone&#8208;selective solvent. Electron microscopy images suggest the phase separation of grafts to result in a network of spherical particles, due to the ability of the branched architecture to freeze chain entanglements and to bridge core domains. Small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering data suggest the architecture promotes the formation of multicore micelles, the core morphology of which transitions from spheres to worms, vesicles, and inverted micelles with increasing volume fraction of the grafts. A time&#8208;resolved SAXS study is presented to illustrate the formation of the inverted phase during a polymerisation. The grafted architecture gives access to unusual morphologies and provides exciting new handles for controlling the polymer structure and material properties.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Strength Plus Reversible Supramolecular Adhesives Achieved by Regulating Intermolecular Pt(II)&#183;&#183;&#183;Pt(II) Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface adhesion has a great contradiction in high strength and good reversibility given their mutually exclusive requirements of fixed crosslinked networks and dynamic chain motion. Herein, we demonstrate a supramolecular organoplatinum(II) adhesive system regulated by intermolecular Pt(II)&#183;&#183;&#183;Pt(II) interactions that can simultaneously achieve high&#8208;strength and excellent reversible adhesion to various substrates. Upon alternating temperature, the assembly of suitably substituted organoplatinum(II) molecules can switch between well&#8208;ordered and disordered states via tuning Pt(II)&#183;&#183;&#183;Pt(II) interactions, resulting in stable reversible adhesion even after 100 cycles with a robust strength of ~ 1.25 MPa and a large on&#8208;off ratio of ~ 25. Along with the switch of Pt(II)&#183;&#183;&#183;Pt(II) contacts, the surface adhesion of organoplatinum(II) adhesives can be monitored by their changes in electrical signals. This study will open up new inspirations for developing high&#8208;performance reversible adhesives.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Challenges remain in establishing a universal method to precisely tune electrochemical properties of conducting polymers for multifunctional neurosensing with high selectivity and sensitivity. Here, we demonstrate a facile and general approach to achieving synergistic charge percolation in conducting polymers (i.e., poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate), PEDOT:PSS) by incorporating conductive catalysts (i.e., carbon nanotubes, CNTs) and post&#8208;processing. The approach shows synergistic effects: (i) CNTs and post&#8208;processing together promote PEDOT ordered interconnection for highly efficient charge percolation that accelerates electrochemical kinetics; (ii) CNTs catalyze the electrooxidation of vitamin C for selective electrochemical sensing; (iii) CNTs enhance the charge storage/injection capacity of PEDOT:PSS. The prepared CNT&#8208;PEDOT:PSS fiber mechanically matches with neural tissues and is proved to be a biocompatible versatile microsensor capable of high&#8208;performance neurosensing in vivo.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Ultrastable Nonsubstituted Quinoline&#8208;Bridged Covalent Organic Frameworks via Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrogenative Annulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring new routes to lock the dynamic C=N bonds in imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is highly desired for enhancing their stability and functionality. Herein, a novel C=N bridge locking strategy via rhodium&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] annulation is developed to construct nonsubstituted quinoline&#8208;linked COFs (NQ&#8208;COFs). The notable feature of this strategy includes high C=N conversion efficiency, oxidant&#8208;free, and generality for synthesis of a variety of NQ&#8208;COFs with high chemical stability. Particularly, after post&#8208;synthetic modification, the crystallinity, topology, and porosity of pristine imine&#8208;linked COFs are well retained. When used as photocatalysts, NQ&#8208;COFs display better visible light absorption and carriers&#8217; separation efficiency due to enhanced in&#8208;plane &#960; conjugation ability, as well as more facile generation of superoxide anion radicals than their counterparts, thus leading to efficient synthesis of 2,4,6&#8208;tris(aryl)pyridines, benzimidazole, and sulfoxide derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Human Cyclophilin B Nuclease Activity Revealed via Nucleic Acid&#8208;Based Electrochemical Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Human cyclophilin B (CypB) is oversecreted by pancreatic cancer cells, making it a potential biomarker for early&#8208;stage disease diagnosis. Our group is motivated to develop aptamer&#8208;based assays to measure CypB levels in biofluids. However, human cyclophilins have been postulated to have collateral nuclease activity, which could impede the use of aptamers for CypB detection. To establish if CypB can hydrolyze electrode&#8208;bound nucleic acids, we used ultrasensitive electrochemical sensors to measure CypB&#8217;s hydrolytic activity. Our sensors use ssDNA and dsDNA in the biologically predominant&#160;D&#8208;DNA form, and in the nuclease resistant&#160;L&#8208;DNA form. Challenging such sensors with CypB and control proteins, we unequivocally demonstrate that CypB can cleave nucleic acids. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use electrochemical biosensors to reveal the hydrolytic activity of a protein that is not known to be a nuclease. Future development of CypB bioassays will require the use of nuclease&#8208;resistant aptamer sequences.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Template&#8208;assisted synthesis of well&#8208;defined polynuclear clusters remains a challenge for [M  4  ] square planar topologies. Herein, we present a tetraamine scaffold  R  L(NH  2  )  4  , where L is a rigidified resorcin[4]arene, to direct the formation of  C  4  &#8208;symmetric  R  L(NH)  4  Cu  4  clusters with Cu&#8211;Cu distances around 2.7 &#197;, suggesting metal&#8208;metal direct interactions are operative since the sum of copper&#8217;s van der Waals radii is 2.8 &#197;. DFT calculations display HOMO to HOMO&#8208;3 residing all within a 0.1 eV gap. These four orbitals display significant electron density contribution from the Cu centers suggesting a delocalized electronic structure. The one&#8208;electron oxidized [Cu  4  ]  +  &#160;species was probed by variable temperature X&#8208;band continuous wave&#8208;electron paramagnetic resonance (CW&#8208;EPR), which displays a multi&#8208;line spectrum at room temperature.

         <title>resPAINT: Accelerating Volumetric Super&#8208;Resolution Localisation Microscopy by Active Control of Probe Emission
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new super&#8208;resolution technique for localisation microscopy, which combines active control of probe photophysics with stochastic binding is reported. resPAINT yields an up to 50&#8208;fold improvement in localisation rate vs. PAINT without compromising contrast and is fully compatible with large depth of field imaging techniques. This opens the door to larger scale 3D localisation microscopy as imaging that normally takes days can now be completed in hours.







Abstract
Points for accumulation in nanoscale topography (PAINT) allows practically unlimited measurements in localisation microscopy but is limited by background fluorescence at high probe concentrations, especially in volumetric imaging. We present reservoir&#8208;PAINT (resPAINT), which combines PAINT and active control of probe photophysics. In resPAINT, an activatable probe &#8220;reservoir&#8221; accumulates on target, enabling a 50&#8208;fold increase in localisation rate versus conventional PAINT, without compromising contrast. By combining resPAINT with large depth&#8208;of&#8208;field microscopy, we demonstrate super&#8208;resolution imaging of entire cell surfaces. We generalise the approach by implementing various switching strategies and 3D imaging techniques. Finally, we use resPAINT with a Fab to image membrane proteins, extending the operating regime of PAINT to include a wider range of biological interactions.

         <title>In Situ Analysis of Membrane&#8208;Protein Binding Kinetics and Cell&#8211;Surface Adhesion Using Plasmonic Scattering Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plasmonic scattering microscopy (PSM) is realized on a prism&#8208;coupled surface plasmon resonance (SPR) system. PSM provides &#8776;7&#8197;times higher spatial resolution and &#8776;70&#8197;times larger field of view than typical SPR microscopy, thus providing more details about cell response to ligand binding on over 100&#8197;cells. PSM also allows mapping adhesion spring constants for quantitatively describing mechanical properties of the cell&#8208;substrate contacts.







Abstract
Surface plasmon resonance microscopy (SPRM) is an excellent platform for in situ studying cell&#8208;substrate interactions. However, SPRM suffers from poor spatial resolution and small field of view. Herein, we demonstrate plasmonic scattering microscopy (PSM) by adding a dry objective on a popular prism&#8208;coupled surface plasmon resonance (SPR) system. PSM not only retains SPRM's high sensitivity and real&#8208;time analysis capability, but also provides &#8776;7&#8197;times higher spatial resolution and &#8776;70&#8197;times larger field of view than the typical SPRM, thus providing more details about membrane protein response to ligand binding on over 100 cells simultaneously. In addition, PSM allows quantifying the target movements in the axial direction with a high spatial resolution, thus allowing mapping adhesion spring constants for quantitatively describing the mechanical properties of the cell&#8208;substrate contacts. This work may offer a powerful and cost&#8208;effective strategy for upgrading current SPR products.

         <title>Rationally Designing Efficient Electrocatalysts for Direct Seawater Splitting: Challenges, Achievements, and Promises</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Directly splitting seawater to produce hydrogen provides a promising pathway for energy and environmental sustainability. However, current seawater splitting confronts many challenges due to the sluggish kinetics, the presence of impurities, membrane contamination, and the competitive chloride oxidation reaction at the anode, making it more difficult than freshwater splitting. This review firstly introduces the basic mechanisms of the anode and cathode reactions during seawater splitting. We critically analyze the primary principles in designing catalysts for seawater splitting concerning both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, including noble metal, noble metal&#8208;free, and metal&#8208;free catalysts. Strategies to design effective catalysts, such as active site population, synergistic effect regulation, and surface engineering, are discussed. Also, promises, perspectives, and challenges in developing seawater splitting technologies for clean hydrogen generation are summarized.</dc:description>

We critically analyze the primary principles in designing catalysts for seawater splitting concerning both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, including noble metal, noble metal-free, and metal-free catalysts. Strategies to design effective catalysts, such as active site population, synergistic effect regulation, and surface engineering, are discussed. Also, promises, perspectives, and challenges in developing seawater splitting technologies for clean hydrogen generation are summarized.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;power Near&#8208;neutral Aqueous All Organic Redox Flow Battery Enabled with a Pair of Anionic Redox Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) are regarded as a promising alternative for low&#8208;cost and durable grid&#8208;scale energy storage. However, the narrow potential gap, chemical lability and membrane fouling in most AORFBs constitute formidable roadblocks for practical applications. Herein, a pair of anionic organic molecules, namely (PPBPy)Br  2  and PSS&#8208;TEMPO, are proposed. The (PPBPy)Br  2  in anolyte reveals remarkable electrochemical stability without degradation after 1000 cycles, while PSS&#8208;TEMPO in catholyte presents a capacity decay rate as low as 0.012%/cycle. At near&#8208;neutral conditions, the (PPBPy)Br  2  /PSS&#8208;TEMPO flow cell exhibits a high voltage of 1.61 V, extremely low permeability across cation&#8208;exchange membrane and thus excellent cycling stability. Notably, a highest peak power density of 509 mW/cm  2  has been achieved among reported all&#8208;organic aqueous RFBs. The molecular engineering strategies demonstrated here could provide a credible example of high&#8208;performance AORFBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Oxidative Lactonization of Enynyl Boronates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidation of C&#8722;B bonds is extensively used in organic synthesis, materials science, and chemically biology. However, these oxidations is usually limited to the oxidation of C(sp3)&#8722;B and C(sp2)&#8722;B bonds. The C(sp)&#8722;B bond oxidation is rarely developed. Herein we present a novel strategy for the preparation of &#947;&#8208;lactones via the oxidation of enynyl boronates. This process successively involves the C(sp)&#8722;B bond oxidation, the epoxidation of C&#8722;C double bond and the lactonization. This protocol provided various &#947;&#8208;lactones and unsaturated butenolides efficiently that are prevalent in numerous nature products and bioactive molecules. Most importantly, asymmetric oxidative lactonization of enynyl boronates was also achieved, providing chiral &#947;&#8208;lactones in high enantioselectivitis and diastereoselectivities. The versatile transformations and ubiquity of &#947;&#8208;lactones shed light on the importance of this strategy in the construction and late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Hydrogen Oxidation and Evolution Kinetics by Tuning the Interfacial Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Environment on Functionalized Platinum Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Specifically adsorbed organic additives are found to enhance the intrinsic kinetics of hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions in alkaline solution on Pt surfaces by reorganizing the interfacial water structure. In situ vibrational spectroscopies present compelling evidence that weakly hydrogen&#8208;bonded water has a substantial impact on the hydrogen electrocatalytic process.







Abstract
Developing efficient catalytic systems for the hydrogen oxidation and evolution reactions (HOR/HER) is essential in the world's transition to renewable energy. There is a growing recognition that the HOR/HER activity depends on properties of the electrochemical interface, rather than just the composition and structure of the catalyst. Herein, we demonstrate that specifically adsorbed organic additives (theophylline derivatives) could enhance the intrinsic HOR/HER activity in base on polycrystalline Pt by up to a factor of 3 via introducing weakly hydrogen&#8208;bonded water, as confirmed by in situ surface enhanced infrared and Raman spectroscopies. Optimal HOR/HER activity is achieved on a 7&#8208;n&#8208;butyltheophylline decorated Pt surface, which sufficiently disrupts the hydrogen bonding network in the double layer without depleting the interfacial water. This work demonstrates the promise of electrochemical interfacial engineering as a strategy to boost electrocatalytic performance.

         <title>Membrane Manipulation of Giant Unilamellar Polymer Vesicles with a Temperature&#8208;Responsive Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Membrane manipulation of giant polymers using a temperature&#8208;responsive polymer is reported. The strategy makes it possible to develop materials and create compartmentalized systems that can mimic the adaptive properties of biomembranes.







Abstract
Understanding the complex behavior and dynamics of cellular membranes is integral to gain insight into cellular division and fusion processes. Bottom&#8208;up synthetic cells are as a platform for replicating and probing cellular behavior. Giant polymer vesicles are more robust than liposomal counterparts, as well as having a broad range of chemical functionalities. However, the stability of the membrane can prohibit dynamic processes such as membrane phase separation and division. Here, we present a method for manipulating the membrane of giant polymersomes using a temperature responsive polymer. Upon elevation of temperature deformation and phase separation of the membrane was observed. Upon cooling, the membrane relaxed and became homogeneous again, with infrequent division of the synthetic cells.

         <title>Controlling the Transition of Nanospheres to Superhelices in Aqueous Media by Using a &#8220;Smart&#8221; Pyrazine Building Block</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple strategy to control the supramolecular chirality and morphology of co&#8208;assembled architecture of Pyra&#8208;Met in the presence of Au3+ ions and L&#8208;methionine in aqueous media has been described by fine tailoring of the chiral handle of the pyrazine building block.







Abstract
For the development of nature&#8208;inspired chiral nanostructures, controlling the chirality communication along the assembling pathways in aqueous media is a crucial task. Herein, we designed and synthesized pyrazine&#8208;based derivative Pyra&#8208;Met with an L&#8208;methionine group as a chiral handle. Due to the presence of flexible side chains in the Pyra&#8208;Met building block, its interactions with the solvent molecules in the assembled state are restricted, which leads to the generation of nanospheres in aqueous media. The Pyra&#8208;Met nanospheres selectively interact with Au3+ ions to generate dynamic helical fibers of the Pyra&#8208;Met:Au3+ ensemble with &#8216;hidden&#8217; chirality. Finally, superhelices with the desired helical sense are achieved in the presence of L/D&#8208;methionine via a co&#8208;assembly process. This work presents a feasible strategy to achieve the desired handedness of supramolecular assemblies for better understanding of chirality translation in supramolecular chemistry and it highlights the importance of fine tailoring of building block to control the morphology of the assembled architecture.

         <title>Metal Nanoparticles on Lipophilic Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The basal planes of lipophilic nanographenes were utilized for anchoring metal nanoparticles. Six metal cations were confirmed to form metal nanoparticles with a few to tens of nanometer in diameter. Palladium nanoparticle&#8208;doped lipophilic nanographenes displayed catalytic function in the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross coupling reaction.







Abstract
Utilization of graphitic domains on nanographenes (NGs) for anchoring metal nanoparticles (NPs) can open the door for their applications in catalysis.

&lt;p&gt;The basal planes of lipophilic nanographenes were utilized for anchoring metal nanoparticles. Six metal cations were confirmed to form metal nanoparticles with a few to tens of nanometer in diameter. Palladium nanoparticle-doped lipophilic nanographenes displayed catalytic function in the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross coupling reaction.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Urea Electrolysis: From Nitrite and Cyanate as Major Products to Nitrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Urea electrooxidation to N2 is a promising anodic process for producing renewable fuels at the cathode. However, Ni(OH)2&#8208;catalyzed urea oxidation predominantly produces a &#8776;1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture of nitrite+cyanate, with N2 being a minor product. A mechanistic analysis suggests that the binding site availability for both N atoms in urea is crucial for reaction selectivity. Doping Ni(OH)2 with Cu significantly suppresses the cyanate+nitrate pathway.







Abstract
The electrochemical urea oxidation reaction (UOR) to N2 represents an efficient route to simultaneous nitrogen removal from N&#8208;enriched waste and production of renewable fuels at the cathode. However, the overoxidation of urea to NOx&#8722; usually dominates over its oxidation to N2 at Ni(OH)2&#8208;based anodes. Furthermore, detailed reaction mechanisms of UOR remain unclear, hindering the rational catalyst design. We found that UOR to NOx&#8722; on Ni(OH)2 is accompanied by the formation of near stoichiometric amount of cyanate (NCO&#8722;), which enabled the elucidation of UOR mechanisms. Based on our experimental and computational findings, we show that the formation of NOx&#8722; and N2 follows two distinct vacancy&#8208;dependent pathways. We also demonstrate that the reaction selectivity can be steered towards N2 formation by altering the composition of the catalyst, e.g., doping the catalyst with copper (Ni0.8Cu0.2(OH)2) increases the faradaic efficiency of N2 from 30&#8201;% to 55&#8201;%.

         <title>Direct Observation of Li&#8208;Ion Transport Heterogeneity Induced by Nanoscale Phase Separation in Li&#8208;rich Cathodes of Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
HAADF and in situ DPC&#8208;STEM were used to directly observe Li&#8208;ion transport heterogeneity caused by phase separation, which elucidates the reason for the capacity limitation of Li&#8208;rich layered oxides.







Abstract
Li&#8208;rich layered oxide (LLO) cathode materials with high specific capacities could significantly enhance the energy density of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). However, the specific practical capacities of LLO materials in ASSLBs are extremely low due to poor initial activation. Here, scanning transmission electron microscopy with in situ differential phase contrast imaging was first used to study the initial activation mechanism of Li1.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54O2. Li&#8208;ion transport heterogeneity was observed in LLO grains and across the LLO/Li6PS5Cl interface, due to the coexistence of the nanoscale Li2MnO3 and LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 phases. Consequently, the severely constrained activation of Li2MnO3 during the first charging could be attributed to a nanoscale phase separation in LLO, hindering Li&#8208;ion transport through its particles, and causing high impedance in the Li2MnO3 domain/Li6PS5Cl interface. This study could facilitate interface design of high&#8208;performance LLO&#8208;based ASSLBs.

         <title>An Organic Laser Based on Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission and Local Excited State Characteristics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A material that achieves thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties from the local excited (LE) state is confirmed. The emission dominated by LE states leads to aggregation induced emission (AIE) in single crystal organic microwires. This result expands the way to realize electric driving laser by using aggregation induced TADF (AI&#8208;TADF) material as gain medium.







Abstract
The spatial separation between the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO and LUMO) in thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) molecules leads to charge transfer (CT) states, which degrade the oscillator strength of emission transition and sacrifices high solid&#8208;state photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), together limiting its application in organic solid&#8208;state lasers (OSSLs). Here, we demonstrated organic microwire lasers from TADF emitters that combine aggregation induced emission (AIE) and local excited (LE) state characteristics. The unique AIE and LE feature lead to a PLQY approaching 50&#8201;% and a high optical gain of 870&#8197;cm&#8722;1 for TADF microwires. The regenerated singlet excitons by reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process are conducive to population inversion. As a result, we demonstrated microwire lasers around 465&#8197;nm with a low threshold of 3.74&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Therefore, our work provides insight to design TADF materials for OSSLs.

         <title>Optimize Lithium Deposition at Low Temperature by Weakly Solvating Power Solvent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly reversible Li plating/stripping behavior at low temperature environment is achieved by accelerating the Li+ desolvation process by employing weakly solvating power DMM as electrolyte solvent. As a result, there displayed high Li metal coulombic efficiency and avoided dendritic growth from room temperature to &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
For lithium (Li) metal batteries, the decrease in operating temperature brings severe safety issues by more disordered Li deposition. Here, we demonstrate that the solvating power of solvent is closely related to the reversibility of the Li deposition/stripping process under low&#8208;temperature conditions. The electrolyte with weakly solvating power solvent shows lower desolvation energy, allowing for a uniform Li deposition morphology, as well as a high deposition/stripping efficiency (97.87&#8201;% at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C). Based on a weakly solvating electrolyte, we further built a full cell by coupling the Li metal anode with a sulfurized polyacrylonitrile electrode at a low anode&#8208;to&#8208;cathode capacity ratio for steady cycling at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. Our results clarified the relationship between solvating power of solvent and Li deposition behavior at low temperatures.

         <title>A Chemically Recyclable Crosslinked Polymer Network Enabled by Orthogonal Dynamic Covalent Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining two types of dynamic covalent chemistries within a single network enables a chemically recyclable crosslinked material with excellent mechanical performances. Virgin&#8208;quality monomers can be recovered and reused by efficient depolymerization under mild conditions.







Abstract
Chemical recycling of synthetic polymers offers a solution for developing sustainable plastics and materials. Here we show that two types of dynamic covalent chemistry can be orthogonalized in a solvent&#8208;free polymer network and thus enable a chemically recyclable crosslinked material. Using a simple acylhydrazine&#8208;based 1,2&#8208;dithiolane as the starting material, the disulfide&#8208;mediated reversible polymerization and acylhydrazone&#8208;based dynamic covalent crosslinking can be combined in a one&#8208;pot solvent&#8208;free reaction, resulting in mechanically robust, tough, and processable crosslinked materials. The dynamic covalent bonds in both backbones and crosslinkers endow the network with depolymerization capability under mild conditions and, importantly, virgin&#8208;quality monomers can be recovered and separated. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study show opportunities to design chemically recyclable materials based on the dynamic chemistry toolbox.

         <title>Emissive Metallacage&#8208;Cored Polyurethanes with Self&#8208;Healing and Shape Memory Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A type of metallacage&#8208;cored polyurethanes was prepared using emissive metallacages as crosslinks. As the content of the metallacages increases, the mechanical properties of such polymers are greatly enhanced. These polymers not only show intense emission both in solution and in the solid state, but also exhibit good self&#8208;healing and shape memory properties, which promotes the applications of metallacage&#8208;cored networks as elastic smart materials.







Abstract
The structures of the crosslinks in supramolecular polymer networks play an important role on their properties and functions. Herein, emissive metallacages are used as crosslinks to prepare metallacage&#8208;cored polyurethanes. The mechanical properties including storage modulus, toughness, Young's modulus and breaking strength of polymers are greatly enhanced with the increase of crosslinking densities. Moreover, such polymers not only exhibit good fluorescence in the solid state, but also show self&#8208;healing and shape memory properties owing to the dynamic reversible non&#8208;covalent bonds in their structures. This study not only offers a convenient strategy to prepare metallacage&#8208;crosslinked networks, but also explores their applications as self&#8208;healing and shape memory materials, which will promote the study of metallacage&#8208;cored supramolecular networks as smart materials.

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of Multiply Seven&#8208;Membered&#8208;Ring Fused Porphyrins by Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed [5+2] Annulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed tandem C&#8722;H functionalization/annulation of porphyrins with internal alkynes gives singly, doubly, and quadruply seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring fused porphyrins. This is the first example of [5+2] annulation reaction for porphyrins. The optical and electrochemical highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)&#8211;lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) gaps, as well as the aromatic character of the fused porphyrins decrease as the number of fused parts increases.







Abstract
Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed reaction of meso&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;yl NiII porphyrins with internal alkynes proceeded smoothly to give singly, doubly, and quadruply seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring fused NiII porphyrins as the first example of [5+2] annulation reaction for porphyrin substrates, where the meso&#8208;appended pyrrole unit serves as a directing group. These reactions are operationally quite simple and easy. A plausible reaction mechanism was proposed on the basis of the isolation of a key intermediate. The structures of the representative products have been revealed to be considerably bent owing to the implemented seven&#8208;membered rings. Doubly fused ZnII and NiII porphyrins possessing an unsubstituted meso&#8208;position were dimerized to meso&#8208;meso linked dimers by aerobic oxidation with Zn(OAc)2&#8901;2&#8201;H2O and electrochemical oxidation, respectively. The optical and electrochemical highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)&#8211;lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) gaps, as well as the aromatic characters of the fused porphyrins decrease as the fusion parts increases.

         <dc:description>
The first example of a double&#8208;helical metal&#8208;chain metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with a network structure (ZUT&#8208;8) is prepared. It shows high chemical stability, functional adjustability and excellent output performance of friction power generation, which is superior to traditional coordination polymer materials. The highly conjugated ZUT&#8208;8 structure was introduced into a cathodic metal&#8208;protection system where it significantly decreases metal corrosion.







Abstract
The development of novel metal organic framework (MOF) friction power generation materials with high stability is important. This paper reports the first example of a double&#8208;helix metal chain organic framework with a network structure (ZUT&#8208;8). ZUT&#8208;8 shows high chemical stability, functional adjustability, and excellent output performance of friction power generation, which is superior to traditional coordination polymer materials. The cathodic protection system with ZUT&#8208;8 can prevent metal corrosion significantly. The output performance can be improved effectively by enhancing the conjugate effect of the linker. The theoretical calculation results showed that an increase in the degree of conjugation could significantly reduce the band gap, thereby affecting the friction power output signal. This study opens the door to constructing MOF materials with a double&#8208;helix metal chain and will promote their potential applications in self&#8208;powered electrochemical cathodic protection.

         <title>Single&#8208;Step Synthesis of Atropisomers with Vicinal C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N Diaxes by Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective C&#8722;H Annulation</title>

         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;step construction of atropisomers with vicinal C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N chiral diaxes by cyclopentadiene (Cp)&#8208;free cobalt&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular atroposelective C&#8722;H annulation with decent stereocontrols (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee and 70/1 dr) was reported. Atropisomerization experiments and DFT calculations are done to study the rotational barriers and pathways of the diaxes.







Abstract
The atroposelective synthesis of atropisomers with vicinal diaxes remains rare and challenging, due to the steric influence between the two axes and their unique topology. Herein, we disclose a single&#8208;step construction of atropisomers with vicinal C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N chiral diaxes by cyclopentadiene (Cp)&#8208;free cobalt&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular atroposelective C&#8722;H annulation, providing the desired diaxial atropisomers of unique structures with decent stereocontrols of both axes (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee and 70&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). The optically pure products bearing fluorophores show circular polarized luminescence (CPL) properties, being candidate materials for potential CPL applications. Atropisomerization experiments and density function theory (DFT) calculations are conducted to study the rotational barriers and rotation pathways of the diaxes.

         <title>Selective CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol over a Carbon&#8208;Coated CuOx Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbon&#8208;coated CuOx catalyst achieves a remarkable ethanol partial current density of 166&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 46&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency, substantially higher than those over most reported copper&#8208;based catalysts. The surface carbon coating can effectively stabilize the abundant Cu+ species, thus facilitate C&#8722;C coupling by improving *CO adsorption, and tune the key intermediate *HOCCH in the hydrogenation pathway toward ethanol production.







Abstract
The design of efficient copper(Cu)&#8208;based catalysts is critical for CO2 electroreduction into multiple carbon products. However, most Cu&#8208;based catalysts are favorable for ethylene production while selective production of ethanol with high Faradaic efficiency and current density still remains a great challenge. Herein, we design a carbon&#8208;coated CuOx (CuOx@C) catalyst through one&#8208;pot pyrolysis of Cu&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), which exhibits high selectivity for CO2 electroreduction to ethanol with Faradaic efficiency of 46&#8201;%. Impressively, the partial current density of ethanol reaches 166&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is higher than that of most reported catalysts. Operando Raman spectra indicate that the carbon coating can efficiently stabilize Cu+ species under CO2 electroreduction conditions, which promotes the C&#8722;C coupling step. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the carbon layer can tune the key intermediate *HOCCH goes the hydrogenation pathway toward ethanol production.

         <title>Photoredox Activation of Anhydrides for the Solvent&#8208;Controlled Switchable Synthesis of gem&#8208;Difluoro Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of the  gem  &#8208;difluoromethylene (CF  2  ) group into organic frameworks is highly sought due to the influence of this unit on physicochemical and pharmacological properties of molecules. Herein we report an operationally simple, mild, and switchable protocol to access various  gem  &#8208;difluoro compounds that employs chlorodifloroacetic anhydride (CDFAA) as a low cost and versatile fluoroalkylating reagent. Detailed mechanistic studies revealed that electron&#8208;transfer photocatalysis triggers mesolytic cleavage of a C&#8722;Cl bond generating a  gem  &#8208;difluoroalkyl radical. In the presence of alkene, this radical species acts as an unique intermediate, that under solvent&#8208;controlled reaction conditions, delivers a wide range of  gem  &#8208;difluorinated g&#8208;lactams, g&#8208;lactones, and promotes oxy&#8208;perfluoroalkylation. These protocols are flow and batch scalable, possess excellent chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, and can be used for the late&#8208;stage diversification of complex molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Reconstruction of Highly Dense Cu&#8722;N4 Active Sites in Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction Characterized by Operando Synchrotron Radiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emerging star of single atomic site (SAS) catalyst has been regarded as the most promising Pt&#8208;substituted electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs). However, the metal loading in SAS directly affects the whole device performance. Herein, we report a dual nitrogen source coordinated strategy to realize high dense Cu&#8722;N  4  SAS with a metal loading of 5.61 wt% supported on 3D N&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes/graphene structure wherein simultaneously performs superior ORR activity and stability in alkaline media. When applied in H  2  /O  2  AEMFC, it could reach an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.90 V and a peak power density of 324 mW cm  &#8722;2  . Operando synchrotron radiation analyses identify the reconstruction from initial Cu&#8722;N  4  to Cu&#8722;N  4  /Cu&#8211;nanoclusters (NC) and the subsequent Cu&#8722;N  3  /Cu&#8211;NC under working conditions, which gradually regulate the d&#8208;band center of central metal and balance the Gibbs free energy of *OOH and *O intermediates, benefiting to ORR activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Challenges and Opportunities of Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Chemicals and Fuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The global temperature increase must be limited to below 1.5 &#176;C to alleviate the worst effects of climate change. The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (ECO2R) into chemicals and feedstocks is considered one of the promising technologies for CO2 emission cuts at the industrial level. However, despite decades of studies, advances at the laboratory scale have not yet led to high industrial deployment rates. This Review discusses the practical challenges of the industrial chain hampering the scaling&#8208;up deployment of the ECO2R technology. For ECO2R&#8208;to&#8208;CO/HCOOH, Faradic efficiencies (FEs) of ~100% and current densities above 200 mA/cm2 were achieved, and the stability of the electrolysis system was prolonged to 2000 h. For ECO2R&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4, the extreme FE was over 80%, and the highest current density reached the A/cm2 level. Thus, it is believed that ECO2R may have reached the scale&#8208;up demonstration stage. We aim to provide insights that can accelerate the development of the ECO2R technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Phen&#8208;DC3 Induces Refolding of Human Telomeric DNA into a Chair&#8208;type Antiparallel G&#8208;quadruplex through Ligand Intercalation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Human telomeric G&#8208;quadruplex DNA structures are attractive anticancer drug targets, but the target&#8217;s polymorphism complicates the drug design: different ligands prefer different folds, and very few complexes have been solved at high resolution. Here we report that Phen&#8208;DC  3  , one of the most prominent G&#8208;quadruplex ligands in terms of high binding affinity and selectivity, causes dTAGGG(TTAGGG)  3  to completely change its fold in KCl solution from a hybrid&#8208;1 to an antiparallel chair&#8208;type structure, wherein the ligand intercalates between a two&#8208;quartet unit and a pseudo&#8208;quartet, thereby ejecting one potassium ion. This unprecedented high&#8208;resolution NMR structure shows for the first time a true ligand intercalation into an intramolecular G&#8208;quadruplex.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Activatable Chemokine Conjugates for In Vivo Targeting of Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Increased levels of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) are indicators of poor prognosis in most cancers. Although antibodies and small molecules blocking the recruitment of macrophages to tumors are under evaluation as anticancer therapies, these strategies are not specific for macrophage subpopulations. Herein we report the first enzyme&#8208;activatable chemokine conjugates for effective targeting of defined macrophage subsets in live tumors. Our constructs exploit the high expression of chemokine receptors (e.g., CCR2) and the activity of cysteine cathepsins in TAMs to target these cells selectively over other macrophages and immune cells (e.g., neutrophils, T cells, B cells). Furthermore, we demonstrate that cathepsin&#8208;activatable chemokines are compatible with both fluorescent and therapeutic cargos, opening new avenues in the design of targeted theranostic probes for immune cells in the tumor microenvironment.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous and Spontaneous Oxidation and Reduction in Microdroplets by the Water Radical Cation/Anion Pair</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microdroplets show unique chemistry, especially in their intrinsic redox properties, and to this we here add a case of simultaneous and spontaneous oxidation and reduction. We report the concurrent conversions of several phosphonates to phosphonic acids by reduction (R&#8208;P &#8208;&gt; H&#8208;P) and to pentavalent phosphoric acids by oxidation. The experimental results suggest that the active reagent is the water radical cation/anion pair. The water radical cation is observed directly as the ionized water dimer while the water radical anion is only seen indirectly though the spontaneous reduction of carbon dioxide to formate. The coexistence of oxidative and reductive species in turn supports the proposal of a double&#8208;layer structure at the droplet surface, where the water radical cation and radical anion are separated and accumulated.</dc:description>

         <title>Differential Peptide Multi&#8208;Macrocyclizations at the Surface of a Helical Foldamer Template</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid sequences comprising a peptide with several Cys residues and an aromatic foldamer helix with several chloroacetamide functions at its surface were synthesized. Such products may in principle form numerous macromulticyclic thioether products by intramolecularly combining all Cys residues and all chloroacetamide functions. However, we show that the reactive sites on the structurally defined helix can be placed at such locations that the peptide selectively stiches itself to form a series of different macrocycles within mostly one preferred product. Reactions were monitored by HPLC and products with two, three or four macrocycles were identified using LC&#8208;MS and NMR. The series of selective macrocyclizations define a sort of reaction trail where reaction sites otherwise identical are involved successively because of their precise positioning in space. The trails can be predicted to a large extent based on structural considerations and the assumption that smaller macrocycles form faster.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Macrocyclic Triangles into Helicity&#8208;Opposite Nanotwists by Competitive Planar over Point Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While helix has elegant biomimetic structures and functionalities, it still remains a big question how the nanoscale helicity evolved from the molecular chiral building blocks across length scales. Herein, macrocyclic triangles composed of achiral edges and chiral vertices were rationally designed, in which the planar chirality emerged due to the restriction of edge rotation by intermolecular stackings and led to a unique chiral self&#8208;assembly. In contrast to the solution systems where the chiroptical property is exclusively dominated by the point chiral vertices, the emerged planar chirality was found to control the chiral self&#8208;assembly, resulting the nanotwist with the handedness determined by the planar chirality. Our work unveiled the self&#8208;assembly behaviors of macrocyclic conformers for the first time and provided a deep understanding on the macrocyclic chirality evolution including the excited&#8208;state chirality.</dc:description>

         <title>Fiber&#8208;spinning Asymmetric Assembly for Janus&#8208;structured Bifunctional Nanofiber Films towards All&#8208;Weather Smart Textile</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given health threat by global warming and increased energy consumption in regulating body temperature, it is an urgent need to construct smart temperature&#8208;regulating materials. Herein, a novel fiber&#8208;spinning asymmetric chemical assembly (FACA) method is proposed to construct nanofiber materials with asymmetric photothermal properties. The silver nanowires (AgNWs) and poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP) with opposite thermal radiation are assembled on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) film, imparting AgNW/rGO/PVDF&#8208;HFP film with Janus structure that can realize the AgNWs side consistently keeps temperature of  ca.  11  o  C lower than the side of PVDF&#8208;HFP nanofiber regardless of the irradiation directions under 1 sun, suggesting the adjustable photothermal regulation. Such photothermally selective hybrid nanofiber film provides great potential as fabrics to achieve all&#8208;weather smart clothes, promoting controllable and comprehensive utilization of solar energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioorthogonal Lanthanide Molecular Probes for Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescence and Mass Spectrometry Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here the development of clickable and highly near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent lanthanide (Ln) complexes for bioorthogonal labeling of biomolecules. These azide&#8208; or alkyne&#8208;functionalized Ln complexes are hydrophilic and fluorogenic, exhibiting a strong increase of NIR fluorescence upon conjugation with biomolecules. Metabolic labeling of biomolecules with azide or alkyne, followed by click labeling with the Ln complexes, enables NIR fluorescence (NIRF) imaging of DNA, RNA, proteins, and glycans in cells. Furthermore, multicolor imaging is performed by combining click&#8208;labeling with the Ln complexes and immunostaining. In addition, the Ln complexes is compatible with click&#8208;expansion microscopy (click&#8208;ExM), which enables super&#8208;resolution NIRF imaging of cellular glycoproteins. Finally, the Ln complexes can be used for time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS) imaging, thus achieving the first example of dual&#8208;modal imaging combining NIRF and SIMS microscopies.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic reagents for enzyme&#8208;catalyzed methylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Late&#8208;stage methylation is a key technology in the development of pharmaceutical compounds. Methyltransferase biocatalysis may provide powerful options to insert methyl groups into complex molecules with high regio&#8208; and chemo&#8208;selectivity. The challenge of a large&#8208;scale application of methyltransferases is their dependence on&#160;S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) as a stoichiometric, and thus exceedingly expensive co&#8208;substrate. As a solution to this problem, we and others have explored the use of methyl halides as reagents for&#160;in&#8208;situ&#160;regeneration of SAM. However, the need to handle volatile electrophiles such as methyl iodide (MeI) may also hamper applications at scale. As a more practical solution, we have now developed an enzyme&#8208;catalyzed process that affords regeneration of SAM with methyl toluene sulfonate. In this report we describe enzymes from the thiopurine methyltransferase family that accept sulfate&#8208; and sulfonate&#8208;based methyl donors to convert S&#8208;adenosylhomocysteine to SAM with efficiencies that rival MeI&#8208;based reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Unusual Enantiodivergence in Chiral Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Allylation with &#946;&#8208;Alkenyl Allylic Boronates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein a rare example of enantiodivergent aldehyde addition with &#946;&#8208;alkenyl allylic boronates via chiral Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis. Chiral phosphoric acid (  S  )&#8208;  A  2  &#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylation using &#946;&#8208;vinyl substituted allylboronate gave alcohols with  R  absolute configuration. The sense of asymmetric induction of the acid catalyst in these reactions is opposite to those in prior reports. Moreover, in the presence of the same acid catalyst, the reactions with &#946;&#8208;2&#8208;propenyl substituted allylboronate generated homoallylic alcohol products with  S  absolute configuration. Unusual substrate&#8208;catalyst C&#8211;H  &#8226;&#8226;&#8226;  &#960; interactions in the favored reaction transition state were identified as the origins of observed enantiodivergence in these reactions through DFT computational studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;Coordination Single Au Atoms on Ultrathin ZnIn2S4 Nanosheets&#160;for Selective Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction towards CH4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective CO2  photoreduction to hydrocarbon fuels such as CH4  is promising and sustainable for carbon&#8208;neutral future. However, lack of proper binding strengths with reaction intermediates makes it still a challenge for photocatalytic CO2  methanation with both high activity and selectivity. Here, the low&#8208;coordination single Au atoms (Au1&#8208;S2  ) on ultrathin ZnIn2S4  nanosheets was synthesized by a complex&#8208;exchange route, enabling exceptional photocatalytic CO2  reduction performance. Under visible light irradiation, Au1/ZnIn2S4  catalyst exhibits a CH4  yield of 275 &#956;mol g&#8722;1  h&#8722;1  with a selectivity as high as 77%. As revealed by detailed characterizations and density functional theory calculations, Au1/ZnIn2S4  with Au1&#8208;S2  structure not only display faster carrier transfer to underpin its superior activity, but also greatly reduce the energy barrier for protonation of *CO and stabilize the *CH3  intermediate, thereby leading to the selective CH4  generation from CO2  photoreduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Crystal Packing by  Terminal   Tert&#8208;butylation toward Enhanced Solid&#8208;State Emission and Efficacious Charge Transport in an Anthracene&#8208;based Molecular Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic semiconductors with combinative high carrier mobility and efficient solid&#8208;state emission are full of challenges but urgently pursued for the development of new emerging optoelectronics. Herein, by delicately regulating the crystal packing of an anthracene based molecular crystal via terminal tert&#8208;butylation, we developed a superior high mobility emissive molecule, 2,6&#8208;di(6&#8208;tert&#8208;butylnaphthyl)anthracene (TBU&#8208;DNA). The novel &#8220;slipped herringbone&#8221; packing motif of TBU&#8208;DNA enables its appropriate exciton&#8208;exciton coupling and electron&#8208;photon coupling, thus resulting in remarkably high solid&#8208;state emission (photoluminescence quantum yield, &#934;  F  &#8776; 74.9%) and efficacious charge transport (carrier mobility,   &#956; = 5.0 cm  2  &#183;V  &#8208;1  &#183;s  &#8208;1  ). Furthermore, OLETs based on TBU&#8208;DNA show an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1.8%, which is among the highest EQE values for single component OLETs reported till now. This work presents a crystal engineering strategy  via  exquisite molecular design to realize high mobility emissive organic semiconductors.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Direct Decarboxylation of Carboxylic Acids to Derivatize or Degrade Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visible light&#8208;mediated direct decarboxylation of carboxylic acids with an acridine photocatalyst is a convenient and powerful method to generate carbon&#8208;centered radicals in polymer chains. Advantageously, this process proceeds under mild conditions, without preactivation of the acid groups. We utilize decarboxylation in the presence of a hydrogen atom donor to form statistical acrylate&#8208;ethylene and acrylate&#8208;propylene copolymers, which are challenging to obtain by direct polymerization. We additionally show that decarboxylation of methacrylic acid units within polymethacrylates can trigger degradation of the polymer backbones. Moreover, a dual catalytic approach, which combines the function of an acridine photocatalyst with that of a cobaloxime catalyst, is leveraged to furnish unique copolymers with pendent alkenes. Our work indicates that direct decarboxylation is a versatile technique for the synthesis of functional materials with tailored compositions and properties.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Route to Flame Aerosol Synthesis and In Situ Functionalization of Mesoporous Silica</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A continuous flame aerosol route to synthesize hollow structured mesoporous silica nanoparticles is presented, and a general in situ functionalization mechanism for loading highly dispersed catalytically active sites is proposed. Multiple applications are addressed in this class of material, including heterogeneous catalysis, dye adsorption, drug delivery, and thermal insulation.







Abstract
Mesoporous silica is a versatile material for energy, environmental, and medical applications. Here, for the first time, we report a flame aerosol synthesis method for a class of mesoporous silica with hollow structure and specific surface area exceeding 1000&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1. We show its superior performance in water purification, as a drug carrier, and in thermal insulation. Moreover, we propose a general route to produce mesoporous nanoshell&#8208;supported nanocatalysts by in situ decoration with active nanoclusters, including noble metal (Pt/SiO2), transition metal (Ni/SiO2), metal oxide (CrO3/SiO2), and alumina support (Co/Al2O3). As a prototypical application, we perform dry reforming of methane using Ni/SiO2, achieving constant 97&#8201;% CH4 and CO2 conversions for more than 200&#8197;hours, dramatically outperforming an MCM&#8208;41 supported Ni catalyst. This work provides a scalable strategy to produce mesoporous nanoshells and proposes an in situ functionalization mechanism to design and produce flexible catalysts for many reactions.

         <title>Zn0.52V2O5&#8722;a&#8901;1.8&#8201;H2O Cathode Stabilized by In Situ Phase Transformation for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries with Ultra&#8208;Long Cyclability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hyper&#8208;stable cathode Zn0.52V2O5&#8722;a&#8901;1.8 H2O (ZVOH) for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries was prepared by in situ self&#8208;transformation using Zn3V3O8, a Zn&#8208;rich vanadate as precursor. ZVOH has excellent structural stability and still maintains a capacity of 95.4&#8201;% after 18&#8201;000&#8197;cycles at the ultrahigh current density of 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
Developing cathode materials integrating good rate performance and sufficient cycle life is the key to commercialization of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. The hyperstable Zn0.52V2O5&#8722;a&#8901;1.8&#8201;H2O (ZVOH) cathode with excellent rate performance has been successfully developed via an in situ self&#8208;transformation from zinc&#8208;rich Zn3V3O8 (ZVO) in this study. Different from the common synthetic method of additional Zn2+ pre&#8208;insertion, ZVOH is obtained from the insertion of structural H2O and the removal of excess Zn2+ in ZVO, ensuring the lattice structure of ZVOH remains relatively intact during the phase transition and rendering good structural stabilities. The ZVOH delivers a reversible capacity of 286.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and of 161.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 18&#8201;000&#8197;cycles with a retention of 95.4&#8201;%, demonstrating excellent rate performance and cyclic stability. We also provide new insights on the structural self&#8208;optimization of Znx(CF3SO3)y(OH)2x&#8722;y&#8901;n&#8201;H2O byproducts and the effect on the mobility of Zn2+ by theoretical calculations and experimental evidence.

         <title>Multicomponent Crystals with Competing Intermolecular Interactions: In Situ X&#8208;ray Diffraction and Luminescent Features Reveal Multimolecular Assembly under Mechanochemical Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of multicomponent molecules with three or more components, which is considered difficult, can be solved by using pre&#8208;stored intermolecular interactions. The fast progression of mechanochemical synthesis has been revealed by in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, whereby the self&#8208;assembly behavior could be expressed as a function of solid&#8208;state luminescence driven by the combination of components.







Abstract
Supramolecular chemistry under mechanochemical conditions has drawn attention because it can induce low&#8208;solubility molecules to self&#8208;assemble, although most of the reported examples have been limited to two&#8208;component systems. We applied mechanochemical synthesis to achieve multimolecular self&#8208;assembly in more challenging three&#8208;component systems. The produced crystals showed multicolor solid&#8208;state luminescence depending on the components when exposed to UV light. Optical outputs and X&#8208;ray diffraction studies were used to examine the self&#8208;assembling behavior in greater depth. Using synchrotron radiation, in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction permitted direct observation of the milling process, which started the self&#8208;assembly process within 1&#8197;min. This research emphasizes the importance of multicomponent molecules with optical functions and self&#8208;assembling behavior and offers the possibility of developing more complicated multicomponent crystals and organic solid solutions for advanced materials.

         <title>Reversible Switchability of Magnetic Anisotropy and Magnetodielectric Effect Induced by Intermolecular Motion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triggered by thermally assisted intermolecular motion via hydrogen bonds, a CoII compound undergoes a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal phase transition near room temperature, accompanied by reversible switching of Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion, magnetic anisotropy and magnetodielectric effect.







Abstract
Introducing magnetic switchability into artificial molecular machines is fascinating for precise control of magnetism via external stimuli. Herein, a field&#8208;induced CoII single&#8208;molecule magnet was found to exhibit the reversible switch of Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion near room temperature, along with thermal conformational motion of the 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 rotor, which pulls the coordinated H2O to rotate through intermolecular hydrogen bonds and triggers a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal phase transition with Twarm=282&#8197;K and Tcool=276&#8197;K. Interestingly, the molecular magnetic anisotropy probed by single&#8208;crystal angular&#8208;resolved magnetometry revealed the reorientation of easy axis by 14.6&#176;. Moreover, ON/OFF negative magnetodielectric effects were respectively observed in the high&#8208;/low&#8208;temperature phase, which manifests the spin&#8208;lattice interaction in the high&#8208;temperature phase could be stronger, in accompanied by the hydrogen bonding between the rotating 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 and the coordinated H2O.

         <title>Surface Activation and Ni&#8208;S Stabilization in NiO/NiS2 for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulk doped Fe not only accelerates the surface reconstruction of NiO/NiS2 into the active NiOOH phase at a lower oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential but also alleviates the oxidation corrosion of partial Ni&#8722;S bonds to provide a promising way to balance the activity and stability of sulfur&#8208;containing materials in the OER process.







Abstract
Manipulating the active species and improving the structural stabilization of sulfur&#8208;containing catalysts during the OER process remain a tremendous challenge. Herein, we constructed NiO/NiS2 and Fe&#8722;NiO/NiS2 as catalyst models to study the effect of Fe doping. As expected, Fe&#8722;NiO/NiS2 exhibits a low overpotential of 270&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The accumulation of hydroxyl groups on the surface of materials after Fe doping can promote the formation of highly active NiOOH at a lower OER potential. Moreover, we investigated the level of corrosion of M&#8722;S bonds and compared the stability variation of M&#8722;S bonds with Fe at different locations. Interestingly, Fe bonded with S in the bulk as the sacrificial agent can alleviate the oxidation corrosion of partial Ni&#8722;S bonds and thus endow Fe&#8722;NiO/NiS2 long&#8208;term durability. This work could motivate the community to focus more on resolving the corrosion of sulfur&#8208;containing materials.

         <title>Efficient Protein&#8211;Protein Couplings Mediated by Small Molecules under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The different reactivities of the fluorine, aldehyde, and phenylsulfonyl groups in 5&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;(phenylsulfonyl)pincolinaldehyde (FPPA) toward free thiols make it possible to couple multiple proteins in distinct manners. A number of protein couplings mediated by FPPA have been demonstrated under mild conditions.







Abstract
Protein&#8211;protein coupling reactions under physiological conditions that do not impact the three&#8208;dimensional structures of the proteins are in high demand. Owing to the combination of phenylsulfonyl and aldehyde groups in 5&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;(phenylsulfonyl)picolinaldehyde (FPPA), the fluorine substituent shows high reactivity toward free thiols. In FPPA, the fluorine is more reactive than phenylsulfonyl for free thiols. Thus the first quantitative nucleophilic substitution can be followed by selective substitution of phenylsulfonyl by an additional thiol or cyclization of aldehyde with a 1,2&#8208;aminothiol molecule. The FPPA mediated protein&#8211;protein coupling proceeds efficiently under mild conditions, resulting in stable protein conjugates. This coupling method has negligible 3D structural perturbations on the target proteins, and it produces overall intact, nearly traceless, and native structural folds of proteins. It is highly suitable for reconstruction of proteins that are difficult to make and segmental isotopic labeling of multidomain proteins.

     alt="Efficient Protein&#8211;Protein Couplings Mediated by Small Molecules under Mild Conditions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The different reactivities of the fluorine, aldehyde, and phenylsulfonyl groups in 5-fluoro-4-(phenylsulfonyl)pincolinaldehyde (FPPA) toward free thiols make it possible to couple multiple proteins in distinct manners. A number of protein couplings mediated by FPPA have been demonstrated under mild conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein&#8211;protein coupling reactions under physiological conditions that do not impact the three-dimensional structures of the proteins are in high demand. Owing to the combination of phenylsulfonyl and aldehyde groups in 5-fluoro-4-(phenylsulfonyl)picolinaldehyde (FPPA), the fluorine substituent shows high reactivity toward free thiols. In FPPA, the fluorine is more reactive than phenylsulfonyl for free thiols. Thus the first quantitative nucleophilic substitution can be followed by selective substitution of phenylsulfonyl by an additional thiol or cyclization of aldehyde with a 1,2-aminothiol molecule. The FPPA mediated protein&#8211;protein coupling proceeds efficiently under mild conditions, resulting in stable protein conjugates. This coupling method has negligible 3D structural perturbations on the target proteins, and it produces overall intact, nearly traceless, and native structural folds of proteins. It is highly suitable for reconstruction of proteins that are difficult to make and segmental isotopic labeling of multidomain proteins.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cathodic Radical Cyclisation of Aryl Halides Using a Strongly&#8208;Reducing Catalytic Mediator in Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cathodic radical cyclisations of aryl halides have been achieved in an undivided flow electrolysis cell, using phenanthrene as mediator in loadings down to 0.05&#8197;equiv, and without the requirement for a sacrificial anode. It is proposed that mediated homogeneous electron transfer proceeds in a reaction layer detached from the cathode, accounting for the observed selectivity.







Abstract
Electro&#8208;reductive radical cyclisation of aryl halides affords the corresponding hetero&#8208; and carbo&#8208;cycles in an undivided flow reactor equipped with steel and carbon electrodes using an organic mediator. A dissolving metal anode is not needed, and the mediator can be employed in a sub&#8208;stoichiometric amount (0.05&#8197;equiv), increasing the practical utility of cathodic radical cyclisation. The methodology is applied to O&#8208;, N&#8208;, and C&#8208;tethers, yielding tricyclic fused and spiro systems. In the absence of mediator, the major pathway is hydrogenolysis of the C&#8722;X bond, a 2&#8201;e&#8722; process occurring at the cathode. Predominance of the radical pathway in presence of a strongly reducing mediator (M) is consistent with homogeneous electron&#8208;transfer in a reaction layer detached from the cathode surface, where the flux of M.&#8722; leaving the electrode is such that little aryl halide reaches the cathode.

The binding of magnesium(II) to adenosine 5&#8242;&#8208;triphosphate in an ionic liquid solution is directly observed using the short&#8208;lived spin&#8208;
 &#946;&#8208;emitter 31Mg as an implanted NMR probe. The results constitute an important advancement toward using 31Mg &#946;&#8208;NMR to monitor magnesium(II) (bio)chemistry in solution.







Abstract
The complexation of MgII with adenosine 5&#8242;&#8208;triphosphate (ATP) is omnipresent in biochemical energy conversion, but is difficult to interrogate directly. Here we use the spin&#8208;
 &#946;&#8208;emitter 31Mg to study MgII&#8208;ATP complexation in 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium acetate (EMIM&#8208;Ac) solutions using &#946;&#8208;radiation&#8208;detected nuclear magnetic resonance (&#946;&#8208;NMR). We demonstrate that (nuclear) spin&#8208;polarized 31Mg, following ion&#8208;implantation from an accelerator beamline into EMIM&#8208;Ac, binds to ATP within its radioactive lifetime before depolarizing. The evolution of the spectra with solute concentration indicates that the implanted 31Mg initially bind to the solvent acetate anions, whereafter they undergo dynamic exchange and form either a mono&#8208; (31Mg&#8208;ATP) or di&#8208;nuclear (31MgMg&#8208;ATP) complex. The chemical shift of 31Mg&#8208;ATP is observed up&#8208;field of 31MgMg&#8208;ATP, in accord with quantum chemical calculations. These observations constitute a crucial advance towards using &#946;&#8208;NMR to probe chemistry and biochemistry in solution.

         <title>Functional Droplets Stabilized by Interfacially Self&#8208;Assembled Chiral Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid&#8211;liquid interfacial chiral assembly route has been developed to produce chiroptical droplets with multiple functions. Chiral triphenylamine monomers are polymerized supramolecularly using &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between the phenyl groups as a trigger. Translation of the chirality of organic molecules to asymmetric nanoparticle assemblies across a liquid&#8211;liquid interface affords chiral nanocomposites stabilized at the liquid&#8211;liquid interface.







Abstract
Here, we show that aqueous dispersions of inorganic nanoparticles bearing negative surface charges would trigger the chiral assembly of organic radical cations solubilized in organic solvent at the liquid&#8211;liquid interface, which consequently produces stable droplets covered by a layer of inorganic/organic chiral nanocomposites. We demonstrate that chirality transfer across the liquid&#8211;liquid interface from the chiral organic monomers to the nanoparticle assemblies is realized. Surprisingly, opposite handedness between molecular assemblies and nanoparticle assemblies is determined from both CD and CPL measurements. Moreover, the functionalities of these &#8220;chiral&#8221; droplets could be further engineered through either a simple mixing or a droplet merging strategy, which enables to produce fluorescent emissive&#8208;tunable, magnetic, as well as magnetofluorescent dual&#8208;functional droplets.

         <title>Ultrathin Covalent Organic Framework Anchored on Graphene for Enhanced Organic Pollutant Removal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin anionic covalent organic framework (COF) was constructed homogeneously on the surface of a graphene template via a facile hydrothermal method. Compared with bulk COF powder, the anionic ultrathin COF exhibited the ability to remove cationic organic dyes of different sizes with higher efficiency.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are of great potential as adsorbents owing to their tailorable functionalities, low density and high porosity. However, their intrinsically stacked two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structure limits the full use of their complete surface for sorption, especially the internal pores. The construction of ultrathin COFs could increase the exposure of active sites to the targeted molecules in a pollutant environment. Herein, an ultrathin COF with a uniform thickness of ca. 2&#8197;nm is prepared employing graphene as the surface template. The resulting hybrid aerogel with an ultralow density (7.1&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;3) exhibits the ability to remove organic dye molecules of different sizes with high efficiency. The three&#8208;dimensional (3D) macroporous structure and well&#8208;exposed adsorption sites permit rapid diffusion of solution and efficient adsorption of organic pollutants, thereby, greatly contributing to its enhanced uptake capacity. This work highlights the effect of COF layer thickness on adsorption performance.

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclopentene Derivatives via Electrochemically Induced Intermolecular Selective (3+2) Annulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical mediator&#8208;induced intermolecular selective (3+2) annulation of readily available alkenes and alkynes/alkenes was developed. The simple and efficient method allows the synthesis of a library of decorated cyclopentenes and cyclopentanes. A preliminary mechanistic investigation was performed, which indicated that an iodine radical and carbon radicals are involved in this transformation.







Abstract
Cyclopentenes are common cores in many natural products, and in bioactive and functional molecules. However, their synthesis remains challenging in terms of harsh conditions, poor selectivity, prefunctionalization of the substrates, over&#8208;reliance on volatile activating reagents and the use of noble metals. Herein, we develop an electrochemical mediator&#8208;induced intermolecular selective (3+2) annulation of readily available alkenes and alkynes/alkenes, which provides a simple and efficient method for the synthesis of a library of decorated cyclopentenes and cyclopentanes. This protocol features high efficiency, mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, and high regioselectivity. Potential applications are demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale synthesis as well as the construction of structural diversity and complexity. A preliminary mechanistic investigation was performed, which indicated that an iodine radical and carbon radicals are involved in this transformation.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Enabled Disproportionation of 1,2&#8208;Diphenylhydrazine at a PV&#8208;Center

         <dc:description>
An unprecedented P&#8208;based catalyst able to promote hydrazine disproportionation has been synthesized. The available set of experimental results and theoretical calculations suggest that this reactivity is unlocked by the cooperation between a redox&#8208;active bis(amidophenolate) ligand and the highly electrophilic central P&#8208;atom.







Abstract
We present herein the synthesis of a nearly square&#8208;pyramidal chlorophosphorane supported by the tetradentate bis(amidophenolate) ligand, N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenoxy)&#8208;1,2&#8208;phenylenediamide. After chloride abstraction the resulting phosphonium cation efficiently promotes the disproportionation of 1,2&#8208;diphenylhydrazine to aniline and azobenzene. Mechanistic studies, spectroscopic analyses and theoretical calculations suggest that this unprecedented reactivity mode for PV&#8208;centres is induced by the high electrophilicity at the cationic PV&#8208;center, which originates from the geometry constraints imposed by the rigid pincer ligand, combined with the ability of the o&#8208;amidophenolate moieties to act as electron reservoir. This study illustrates the promising role of cooperativity between redox&#8208;active ligands and phosphorus for the design of organocatalysts able to promote redox processes.

         <title>Steering Catalytic Activity and Selectivity of CO2 Photoreduction to Syngas with Hydroxy&#8208;Rich Cu2S@ROH&#8208;NiCo2O3 Double&#8208;Shelled Nanoboxes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical Cu2S@ROH&#8208;NiCo2O3 double&#8208;shelled nanoboxes are synthesized through a multistep strategy to regulate the activity and selectivity of CO2 photoreduction into syngas. The hierarchical hollow structure and p&#8211;n heterojunction enable enhanced light absorption and fast charge separation. Moreover, the catalytic activity can be tuned by controlling the content of hydroxy groups on the surfaces of ROH&#8208;NiCo2O3.







Abstract
Simultaneous transformation of CO2 and H2O into syngas (CO and H2) using solar power is desirable for industrial applications. Herein, an efficient photocatalyst based on double&#8208;shelled nanoboxes, with an outer shell of hydroxy&#8208;rich nickel cobaltite nanosheets and an inner shell of Cu2S (Cu2S@ROH&#8208;NiCo2O3), is prepared via a multistep templating strategy. The high performance of Cu2S@ROH&#8208;NiCo2O3 (7.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for CO; 2.8&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for H2) is attributed to the hierarchical hollow geometry and p&#8211;n heterojunction to promote light absorption and charge separation. Spectroscopic and theoretical analyses elucidate that the ROH&#8208;NiCo2O3 surface enhances *CO2 adsorption and lowers energy barriers for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO. Therefore, modulating the hydroxy contents of ROH&#8208;NiCo2O3 can achieve broad CO/H2 ratios from 0.51 to 1.24. This work offers in&#8208;depth insights into adjustable syngas photosynthesis and generalized concepts of selective heterogeneous CO2 photoreduction beyond cobalt&#8208;based oxides.

         <title>Anionic Co&#8208;insertion Charge Storage in Dinitrobenzene Cathodes for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anionic co&#8208;insertion charge storage in dinitrobenzene cathodes is reported, which entails two successive coordination/decoordinations of Zn(OTF)+ complex with the nitro oxygen. The nitroaromatic multielectron chemistry contributes to ultrahigh capacity, fast redox kinetics, and superior cycle stability for the assembled aqueous Zn&#8211;organic battery.







Abstract
Highly active and stable cathodes are critical for aqueous Zn&#8211;organic batteries with high capacity, fast redox kinetics, and long life. We herein report para&#8208;, meta&#8208;, and ortho&#8208;dinitrobenzene (p&#8208;, m&#8208;, and o&#8208;DB) containing two successive two&#8208;electron processes, as cathode materials to boost the battery performance. Theoretical and experimental studies reveal that nitro constitutional isomerism is key to zincophilic activity and redox kinetics. p&#8208;DB hosted in carbon nanoflower harvests a high capacity of 402&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a superior stability up to 25&#8201;000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, giving a Zn&#8211;organic battery with a high energy density of 230&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. An anionic co&#8208;insertion charge storage mechanism is proposed, entailing a two&#8208;step (de)coordination of Zn(CF3SO3)+ with nitro oxygen. Besides, dinitrobenzene can be electrochemically optimized by side group regulation via implanting electron&#8208;withdrawing motifs. This work opens a new window to design multielectron nitroaromatics for Zn&#8211;organic batteries.

         <title>Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer: A New Way to Develop a High&#8208;Performance Fluorescence Sensing Film towards Opto&#8208;Electronically Inert Alkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational design of an o&#8208;carborane&#8208;based U&#8208;shaped fluorophore possessing through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) properties enables the development of a fluorescence film sensor, which allows high&#8208;performance sensing of opto&#8208;electronically inert alkane vapors. This is ascribed to the microenvironmental sensitivity of the fluorophore and the facilitated mass transfer in the film state.







Abstract
New strategies are in high demand for fast, sensitive, selective, on&#8208;site and real&#8208;time detection of the important but challenging alkane vapors owing to their opto&#8208;electronic inertness. Herein, we report, for the first time, a high&#8208;performance fluorescent film sensor (FFS) for the alkanes with a rationally designed through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) molecule as the sensing fluorophore. Steady&#8208;state fluorescence, femto&#8208;second transient absorption spectroscopy and theoretical studies revealed continuous TSCT dynamics in the excited U&#8208;shaped molecule with increasing medium polarity. Furthermore, the interlocked, face&#8208;to&#8208;face alignment between the donor and acceptor favors mass transport of the analyte molecules in the film state. As anticipated, the compound&#8208;based FFS showed an experimental detection limit of &#8776;10&#8197;ppm for n&#8208;pentane, less than 5&#8197;s for a full detection, negligible interference and super&#8208;stability, revealing the effectiveness of the design strategy. Notably, the sensor is small (&#8776;3.7&#8197;cm3), power&#8208;saving, and workable at room temperature.

         <title>Oxidative Elimination and Reductive Addition of Thiol&#8208;Terminated Polymer Ligands to Metal Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidative elimination of thiol&#8208;terminated polymers from Au nanoparticle (NP) surfaces occurs due to the oxidation of the surface metal atoms and breakage of Au&#8722;Au bonds, and leads to NP aggregation, while reductive addition is used to attach freshly added polymers to the metal surface and restabilize aggregated NPs. This oxidative elimination and reductive addition (OERA) strategy enables improvement of the long&#8208;term NP stability and redox&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembly of NPs.







Abstract
Metal nanoparticles (NPs) stabilized with thiol&#8208; (HS&#8208;) terminated polymers have applications in medicine, optoelectronics, and catalysis. It is assumed that upon exposure to oxidants or even air, these NPs lose colloidal stability, due to the oxidation of the HS&#8208;end&#8208;group and elimination of polymer ligands from the NP surface, however, this mechanism does not explain the unsuccessful recovery of the NP stability by adding fresh HS&#8208;terminated polymers. Here we propose the oxidation of the surface metal atoms as a mechanism for the oxidative elimination of polymer from the NP surface. Based on this mechanism, we reversed NP aggregation by reducing the oxidized metal surface and re&#8208;attaching HS&#8208;terminated polymer ligands. This mechanism is general for various metal NPs and different HS&#8208;terminated polymers. We show that oxidative elimination and reductive addition reactions can improve the colloidal stability of polymer&#8208;capped metal NPs and control their redox stimuli&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Sensitive, Selective and Repeatable Fluorescence Sensor for Methanol Based on a Highly Emissive 0D Hybrid Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
0D hybrid lead&#8208;free halide displays highly efficient broadband green light emission with a near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield, and acts as a unique fluorescence sensor for methanol in ethanol with ultrahigh selectivity, sensitivity and repeatability as well as fast response time.







Abstract
A convenient and rapid detection method for methanol in ethanol remains a major challenge due to their indistinguishable physical properties. Herein, a novel fluorescence probe based on perovskite was successfully designed to overcome this bottleneck. We report a new zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid perovskite of [MP]2InxSb1&#8722;xCl7&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6&#8201;H2O (MP=2&#8208;methylpiperazine) displaying an unusual green light emission with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield. Remarkably, this 0D perovskite exhibits reversible methanol&#8208;response luminescence switching between green and yellow color but fail in any other organic vapors. Even for blended alcohol solutions, the luminescent probe exhibits excellent sensing performance with multiple superiorities of rapid response time (30&#8197;s) and ultra&#8208;low detection limit (40&#8197;ppm), etc. Therefore, this 0D perovskite can be utilized as a perfect fluorescence probe to detect traces of methanol from ethanol with ultrahigh sensitivity, selectivity and repeatability. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first perovskite as fluorescence probe for methanol with wide potential in environmental monitoring and methanol detection, etc.

         <title>Enhanced Dihydrogen Activation by Mononuclear Iridium(II) Compounds: A Mechanistic Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two exotic iridium(II) compounds, including the first IrII&#8208;dinitrogen adduct are prepared. The IrII&#8208;dinitrogen adduct activates dihydrogen far more rapidly than its IrI counterpart. A joint experimental/computational effort to elucidate the H2 cleavage mechanism is presented, which enhances the limited mechanistic understanding of reactions mediated by heavier transition&#8208;metal paramagnets.







Abstract
The organometallic chemistry of 4d and 5d transition metals has been vastly dominated by closed&#8208;shell states. The reactivity of their metalloradical species is though remarkable, albeit yet poorly understood and with limited mechanistic investigations available. In this work we report the synthesis and characterization of two mononuclear IrII species, including the first dinitrogen adduct. These compounds activate dihydrogen at a dissimilar rate, in the latter case several orders of magnitude faster than its IrI precursor. A combined experimental/computational investigation to ascertain the mechanism of this transformation in IrII compounds is reported.

         <title>Pure Hydrocarbon Materials as Highly Efficient Host for White Phosphorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes: A New Molecular Design Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pure hydrocarbon (PHC) host materials have been designed for blue and white phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (PhOLEDs). The PHC&#8208;based blue PhOLEDs display external quantum efficiency (EQE) higher than 25&#8201;%. The PHC&#8208;based white PhOLEDs display an EQE of 27.7&#8201;%, which is a similar efficiency to the best reported devices with heteroatom&#8208;based hosts.







Abstract
To date, all efficient host materials reported for phosphorescent OLEDs (PhOLEDs) are constructed with heteroatoms, which have a crucial role in the device performance. However, it has been shown in recent years that the heteroatoms not only increase the design complexity but can also be involved in the instability of the PhOLED, which is nowadays the most important obstacle to overcome. Herein, we design pure aromatic hydrocarbon materials (PHC) as very efficient hosts in high&#8208;performance white and blue PhOLEDs. With EQE of 27.7&#8201;%, the PHC&#8208;based white PhOLEDs display similar efficiency as the best reported with heteroatom&#8208;based hosts. Incorporated as a host in a blue PhOLED, which are still the weakest links of the technology, a very high EQE of 25.6&#8201;% is reached, surpassing, for the first time, the barrier of 25&#8201;% for a PHC and FIrpic blue emitter. This performance shows that the PHC strategy represents an effective alternative for the future development of the OLED industry.

         <title>Revisiting the Dithienophthalimide Building Block: Improved Synthetic Method Yielding New High&#8208;Performance Polymer Donors for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthetic process of dithienophthalimide (DPI) was simplified with a significant reduction of the synthetic cost by using chromium&#8208;mediated cyclization. Furthermore, two DPI&#8208;based nonhalogenated wide&#8208;band gap copolymers are synthesized. The binary organic solar cells based on pBDTT&#8208;DPI&#8208;Me&#8201;:&#8201;Y6 achieve a power conversion efficiency as high as 16.55&#8201;%. These results highlight DPI as an attractive A&#8208;unit for the development of new high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;cost organic semiconductors.







Abstract
Imide&#8208;functionalized arenes have been one of the most promising acceptor (A) units in organic solar cells (OSCs). However, dithienophthalimide (DPI), a hybrid of thieno&#8208;[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole&#8208;4,6&#8208;dione (TPD) and bithiophene imide (BTI) units, has not been revisited since its first synthesis, likely owing to the high synthetic cost of the reported method. In this work, we simplified the synthetic procedure of the DPI skeleton with a significant reduction of the synthetic cost by using chromium&#8208;mediated cyclization as the key chemistry. Using this method, two DPI&#8208;based nonhalogenated D&#8211;A copolymers are synthesized. The binary OSCs based on pBDTT&#8208;DPI&#8208;Me&#8201;:&#8201;Y6 achieves a power conversion efficiency as high as 16.55&#8201;%, highlighting DPI as an attractive A&#8208;unit for further exploration in OSCs.

         <title>Photocycloaddition as a Tool for Modulation of the Lower Critical Solution Temperature in a Molecular &#960;&#8208;System to Control Transmission of Solar Radiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The slow [4+2] photocycloaddition of an amphiphilic anthracene derivative (9&#8208;PA&#8208;1) leads to a bolaamphiphile, 9&#8208;PA&#8208;2. Both molecules exhibited reversible transition between transparent and opaque states within 25&#8211;35&#8201;&#176;C, allowing the construction of smart windows that control the transmission of solar radiation.







Abstract
Diels&#8211;Alder photocycloaddition, a well&#8208;known textbook reaction, has not been explored in materials chemistry. Herein we describe how this classical photochemistry can be used to modulate the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of a molecular &#960;&#8208;system, which can further be exploited for the controlled transmission of solar radiation for the management of indoor heat and light. An amphiphilic anthracene derivative 9&#8208;PA&#8208;1 exhibited LCST behavior at 27&#8211;32&#8201;&#176;C with a reversible transition from a transparent to an opaque phase in water (1&#8211;5&#8197;mM). Irradiation of a toluene solution of 9&#8208;PA&#8208;1 with 365&#8197;nm light resulted in a [4+2] photocycloadduct 9&#8208;PA&#8208;2, which exhibited a modulated LCST behavior at 25&#8211;27&#8201;&#176;C, at a concentration as low as 6&#8197;&#956;M. The photocycloaddition of 9&#8208;PA&#8208;1 was significantly retarded in water, making it a stable candidate for the design of sustainable smart windows. We also demonstrated 100&#8197;cm2 smart window prototypes (&#916;Tlum 82&#8201;%, &#916;TIR 68&#8201;%, &#916;Tsol 73&#8201;%) with more than 1000&#8197;cycles of stable operation.

         <title>Surface Functionalization of Surfactant&#8208;Free Particles: A Strategy to Tailor the Properties of Nanocomposites for Enhanced Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy of functionalizing the surface of &#8220;naked&#8221; particles by using inorganic molecules is proposed. In particular, bismuth thiolate were used to functionalize surfactant&#8208;free SnTe particles&#8217; surfaces. Upon thermal processing, bismuth thiolates decomposition renders SnTe&#8208;Bi2S3 nanocomposites with synergistic functions to enhance thermoelectric performance.







Abstract
The broad implementation of thermoelectricity requires high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;cost materials. One possibility is employing surfactant&#8208;free solution synthesis to produce nanopowders. We propose the strategy of functionalizing &#8220;naked&#8221; particles&#8217; surface by inorganic molecules to control the nanostructure and, consequently, thermoelectric performance. In particular, we use bismuth thiolates to functionalize surfactant&#8208;free SnTe particles&#8217; surfaces. Upon thermal processing, bismuth thiolates decomposition renders SnTe&#8208;Bi2S3 nanocomposites with synergistic functions: 1) carrier concentration optimization by Bi doping; 2) Seebeck coefficient enhancement and bipolar effect suppression by energy filtering; and 3) lattice thermal conductivity reduction by small grain domains, grain boundaries and nanostructuration. Overall, the SnTe&#8208;Bi2S3 nanocomposites exhibit peak z&#8201;T up to 1.3 at 873&#8197;K and an average z&#8201;T of &#8776;0.6 at 300&#8211;873&#8197;K, which is among the highest reported for solution&#8208;processed SnTe.

         <title>Engineering a Local Free Water Enriched Microenvironment for Surpassing Platinum Hydrogen Evolution Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking a hydroxyl group immobilized Ni/Ni3C heterostructure as a prototype, the introduction of a local hydrogen bond force field at the catalyst&#8211;electrolyte interface is proposed to create a free H2O molecule enriched microenvironment near the inner Helmholtz plane. Continuous replenishment of free H2O molecules for the catalytic site achieved highly alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity (500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 @ &#8776;276&#8197;mV), outperforming Pt/C catalysts.







Abstract
Manipulating the catalyst&#8211;electrolyte interface to push reactants into the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) is highly desirable for efficient electrocatalysts, however, it has rarely been implemented due to the elusive electrochemical IHP and inherent inert catalyst surface. Here, we propose the introduction of local force fields by the surface hydroxyl group to engineer the electrochemical microenvironment and enhance alkaline hydrogen evolution activity. Taking a hydroxyl group immobilized Ni/Ni3C heterostructure as a prototype, we reveal that the local hydrogen bond induced by the surface hydroxyl group drags 4&#8208;coordinated hydrogen&#8208;bonded H2O molecules across the IHP to become free H2O and thus continuously supply reactants forcatalytic sites catalytic sites. In addition, the hydroxyl group coupled with the Ni/Ni3C heterostructure further lowers the water dissociation energy by polarization effects. As a direct outcome, hydroxyl&#8208;rich catalysts surpass Pt/C activity at high current density (500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 @ &#8776;276&#8197;mV) in alkaline medium.

         <title>Tuning Interphase Chemistry to Stabilize High&#8208;Voltage LiCoO2 Cathode Material via Spinel Coating</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>

The compositions of cathode electrolyte interphases (CEIs) are largely controlled by the abundant species in the inner Helmholtz layer (IHL) and could be tuned from material aspects. Passivating the reactive cathode surface enables anion&#8208;rich IHLs and LiF&#8208;rich CEIs, not only demonstrating high thermal/cycling stability but also shedding new light on the formation, properties, and modulation of CEIs for advanced battery materials.







Abstract
Cathode electrolyte interphases (CEIs) are critical to the cycling stability of high&#8208;voltage cathodes for batteries, yet their formation mechanism and properties remain elusive. Here we report that the compositions of CEIs are largely controlled by abundant species in the inner Helmholtz layer (IHL) and can be tuned from material aspects. The IHL of LiCoO2 (LCO) was found to alter after charging, with a solvent&#8208;rich environment that results in fragile organic&#8208;rich CEIs. By passivated spinel Li4Mn5O12 coating, we achieve an anion&#8208;rich IHL after charging, thus enabling robust LiF&#8208;rich CEIs. In situ microscopy reveals that LiF&#8208;rich CEIs maintain mechanical integrity at 500&#8201;&#176;C, in sharp contrast to organic&#8208;rich CEIs which undergo severe expansion and subsequent voids/cracks in the cathode. As a result, the spinel&#8208;coated LCO exhibits a high specific capacity of 194&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#8197;C and a capacity retention of 83&#8201;% after 300&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C. Our work sheds new light on modulating CEIs for advanced lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Rechargeable Aqueous Mn&#8208;Metal Battery Enabled by Inorganic&#8211;Organic Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>

Toward the energy upgrade of aqueous batteries, an aqueous Mn&#8208;metal battery is reported for which the electrolyte and inorganic&#8211;organic interfaces were designed. The inorganic interface provides a bubble&#8208;free environment for the organic interface formed by esterification. The Mn||Mn cell shows a life of 200&#8197;h, and the Mn||V2O5 battery realizes a higher output voltage than the Zn||V2O5 counterpart. This work paves the way for Mn&#8208;anode and energetic aqueous batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous batteries that use metal anodes exhibit maximum anodic capacity, whereas the energy density is still unsatisfactory partially due to the high redox potential of the metal anode. Current metal anodes are plagued by the dilemma that the redox potential of Zn is not low enough, whereas Al, Mg, and others with excessively low redox potential cannot work properly in aqueous electrolytes. Mn metal with a suitably low redox potential is a promising candidate, which was rarely explored before. Here, we report a rechargeable aqueous Mn&#8208;metal battery enabled by a well&#8208;designed electrolyte and robust inorganic&#8211;organic interfaces. The inorganic Sn&#8208;based interface with a bottom&#8208;up microstructure was constructed to preliminarily suppress water decomposition. With this bubble&#8208;free interface, the organic interface can be formed via an esterification reaction of sucrose triggered by acyl chloride in the electrolyte, generating a dense physical shield that isolates water while permitting Mn2+ diffusion. Hence, a Mn symmetric cell achieves a superior plating/stripping stability for 200&#8197;hours, and a Mn||V2O5 battery maintains approximately 100&#8201;% capacity after 200&#8197;cycles. Moreover, the Mn||V2O5 battery realizes a much higher output voltage than that of the Zn||V2O5 battery, evidencing the possibility of increasing the energy density through using a Mn anode. This work develops a systematic strategy to stabilize a Mn&#8208;metal anode for Mn&#8208;metal batteries, opening a new door towards enhanced voltage of aqueous batteries.

         <title>Designing Nanostructured 3D Printed Materials by Controlling Macromolecular Architecture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates photopolymerization induced microphase separation (PIMS) for 3D printed materials with nanostructures, which for the first time, are controlled by the structure of macromolecular chain transfer agent (MacroCTA). Importantly, phase&#8208;inverted morphologies featuring precisely defined domain spacings are obtained by using multi&#8208;arm macroCTA, which is not accessible with linear macroCTA.







Abstract
Nanostructured polymeric materials play important roles in many advanced applications, however, controlling the morphologies of polymeric thermosets remains a challenge. This work uses multi&#8208;arm macroCTAs to mediate polymerization&#8208;induced microphase separation (PIMS) and prepare nanostructured materials via photoinduced 3D printing. The characteristic length scale of microphase&#8208;separated domains is determined by the macroCTA arm length, while nanoscale morphologies are controlled by the macroCTA architecture. Specifically, using 2&#8208; and 4&#8208; arm macroCTAs provides materials with different morphologies compared to analogous monofunctional linear macroCTAs at similar compositions. The mechanical properties of these nanostructured thermosets can also be tuned while maintaining the desired morphologies. Using multi&#8208;arm macroCTAs can thus broaden the scope of accessible nanostructures for extended applications, including the fabrication of actuators and potential drug delivery devices.

         <title>Transesterification of Non&#8208;Activated Esters Promoted by Small Molecules Mimicking the Active Site of Hydrolases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small artificial hydrolase that mimics the active centre of chymotrypsin and N&#8208;terminal hydrolases is able to perform, for the first time, the transesterification of ethyl acetate with methanol under neutral conditions and at room temperature. This artificial enzyme also catalysed the transesterification of important neurotransmitter acetylcholine into methyl acetate and choline.







Abstract
The synthesis of small molecules able to mimic the active site of hydrolytic enzymes has been largely pursued in recent decades. The high reaction rates and specificity shown by natural hydrolases present an attractive target, and yet the preparation of suitable small&#8208;molecule mimics remains challenging, requiring activated substrates to achieve productive outcomes. Here we present small synthetic artificial enzymes which mimic the catalytic site and the oxyanion hole of chymotrypsin and N&#8208;terminal hydrolases and are able to perform, for the first time, the transesterification of a non&#8208;activated ester such as ethyl acetate with methanol under mild and neutral reaction conditions.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Demystification of Radical Catalysis by a Coenzyme B12 Dependent Enzyme&#8212;Crystallographic Study of Glutamate Mutase with Cofactor Homologues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glutamate mutase (GM) catalyses the interconversion of glutamate and 3&#8208;methylaspartate. It binds its B12&#8208;cofactor AdoCbl with an essential misfit for its Ado&#8208;group, liberating the clamped down aggressive Ado&#8208;radical in a tight reaction space to even promote &#8220;negative catalysis&#8221;. A &#8220;simply stretched&#8221; AdoCbl&#8208;homolog, in contrast, fits GM, freezing up the intriguing functional structure of this enzyme.







Abstract
Catalysis by radical enzymes dependent on coenzyme B12 (AdoCbl) relies on the reactive primary 5&#8242;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;5&#8242;adenosyl radical, which originates from reversible Co&#8722;C bond homolysis of AdoCbl. This bond homolysis is accelerated roughly 1012&#8208;fold upon binding the enzyme substrate. The structural basis for this activation is still strikingly enigmatic. As revealed here, a displaced firm adenosine binding cavity in substrate&#8208;loaded glutamate mutase (GM) causes a structural misfit for intact AdoCbl that is relieved by the homolytic Co&#8722;C bond cleavage.

&lt;p&gt;Glutamate mutase (GM) catalyses the interconversion of glutamate and 3-methylaspartate. It binds its B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;-cofactor AdoCbl with an essential misfit for its Ado-group, liberating the clamped down aggressive Ado-radical in a tight reaction space to even promote &#8220;negative catalysis&#8221;. A &#8220;simply stretched&#8221; AdoCbl-homolog, in contrast, fits GM, freezing up the intriguing functional structure of this enzyme.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalysis by radical enzymes dependent on coenzyme B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; (AdoCbl) relies on the reactive primary 5&#8242;-deoxy-5&#8242;adenosyl radical, which originates from reversible Co&#8722;C bond homolysis of AdoCbl. This bond homolysis is accelerated roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;-fold upon binding the enzyme substrate. The structural basis for this activation is still strikingly enigmatic. As revealed here, a displaced firm adenosine binding cavity in substrate-loaded glutamate mutase (GM) causes a structural misfit for intact AdoCbl that is relieved by the homolytic Co&#8722;C bond cleavage. Strategically interacting adjacent adenosine- and substrate-binding protein cavities provide a tight caged radical reaction space, controlling the entire radical path. The GM active site is perfectly structured for promoting radical catalysis, including &#8220;negative catalysis&#8221;, a paradigm for AdoCbl-dependent mutases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Sulfur&#8208;Bridged Polycyclic Emitters Towards Tunable TADF and RTP Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By incorporating powerful electron&#8208;donating sulfur atoms into isomeric pentaphene and pentacene frameworks, three highly efficient polycyclic thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), and mixed TADF/RTP molecules were developed for application in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.







Abstract
Highly efficient organic thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) generally consist of a twisted donor&#8211;acceptor skeleton with aromatic amine donors. Herein, through introducing sulfur atoms into isomeric pentaphene and pentacene frameworks, we demonstrate a set of polycyclic luminophores exhibiting efficient TADF and RTP characters. The incorporation of sulfur atoms confirms a folded molecular plane, while intensifies singlet&#8211;triplet spin&#8208;orbit coupling. Further, the isomeric effect has a significant effect on the electronic structure of excited state, giving rise to the investigated compounds tunable luminescence mechanisms of TADF and RTP. With efficient triplet harvesting ability, maximum external quantum efficiencies up to 25.1&#8201;% and 8.7&#8201;% are achieved for the corresponding TADF and RTP OLEDs, verifying the great potential of sulfur&#8208;bridged frameworks for highly efficient devices.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Ethylene Purification from Ternary Mixtures in a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Customized Pore Chemistry and Shape</title>

One&#8208;step purification of C2H4 from ternary C2H2/C2H6/C2H4 mixtures is realized by a multifunctional MOF material via specific binding and shape matching. High adsorption selectivity and trapping capacity towards C2H6 and C2H2 are simultaneously realized, which permits the high&#8208;efficient separation of C2H4 with a record productivity.







Abstract
Adsorptive separation is an energy&#8208;efficient technology for the separation of C2 hydrocarbons. However, it remains a critical problem to directly produce high&#8208;purity C2H4 from ternary C2H2/C2H4/C2H6 mixtures by simultaneously trapping C2H2 and C2H6. Herein, we report the one&#8208;step C2H4 purification from the ternary mixture by a metal&#8211;organic framework Zn(ad)(int) (ad=adeninate; int=isonicotinate). The material combines dense heterocyclic rings and accessible uncoordinated O atoms as strong binding sites for C2H6 and C2H2. Its spindle&#8208;like cage exhibits an interesting shape matching with the targeted molecules, affording Zn(ad)(int) not only high separation selectivity for C2H6/C2H4 and C2H2/C2H4, but also excellent gas capacity. Breakthrough experiments show that polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 can be separated from the ternary mixtures with a record productivity of 1.43&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1. In situ powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectrum analyses further provide deep insights into the separation mechanism.

         <title>Thermoelectric Zintl Compound In1&#8722;xGaxTe: Pure Acoustic Phonon Scattering and Dopant&#8208;Induced Deformation Potential Reduction and Lattice Shrink</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pure acoustic phonon scattering is obtained in a coarse grain&#8208;In0.99Ga0.01Te&#8208;sample. The vibration anharmonicity is significantly enhanced by the Ga dopant, thus also enhancing the bonding hierarchy leading to a reduced deformation potential coefficient and denser intragranular dislocations. These effects collectively lead to a ZT of 1.2 at 648&#8197;K, the highest among its analogues.







Abstract
We report a Zintl phase thermoelectric material, coarse grain&#8208;In0.99Ga0.01Te, achieving a ZT peak of 1.2 at 648&#8197;K and an average ZT=0.8 in 300&#8211;650&#8197;K, which outperforms all the known InTe&#8208;based materials to date. The synergistic optimization of electronic property and phonon transport are achieved by the purification of grain boundary scattering, together with the Ga&#8208;doping&#8208;induced weak phonon&#8208;electron coupling, which enhances the carrier mobility and carrier concentration simultaneously and consequently gives a remarkably increased power factor of 8.9&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;cm&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2. The DFT phonon calculations indicate the dopant reduces the deformation potential coefficient and induces the lattice shrink, which reduces significantly the acoustic cutoff frequency, and enhances the scattering phase space. Moreover, the bonding hierarchy leads to the dense intragranular dislocation arrays, which suppresses the lattice thermal conductivity further and induces an ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (0.21&#8197;Wm&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1).

         <title>Stabilizing Perovskite Precursor by Synergy of Functional Groups for NiOx&#8208;Based Inverted Solar Cells with 23.5&#8201;% Efficiency</title>

A precursor stabilization and defect passivation strategy was developed by employing 3&#8208;hydrazinobenzoic acid (3&#8208;HBA) as a versatile additive. The synergistic effect of &#8722;NHNH2 and &#8722;COOH suppresses oxidation of I&#8722;, deprotonation of organic cations and amine&#8208;cation reaction. The NiOx&#8208;based inverted device achieves a certified efficiency of 23.3&#8201;% with excellent operational stability.







Abstract
Perovskite solar cells suffer from poor reproducibility due to the degradation of perovskite precursor solution. Herein, we report an effective precursor stabilization strategy via incorporating 3&#8208;hydrazinobenzoic acid (3&#8208;HBA) containing carboxyl (&#8722;COOH) and hydrazine (&#8722;NHNH2) functional groups as stabilizer. The oxidation of I&#8722;, deprotonation of organic cations and amine&#8208;cation reaction are the main causes of the degradation of mixed organic cation perovskite precursor solution. The &#8722;NHNH2 can reduce I2 defects back to I&#8722; and thus suppress the oxidation of I&#8722;, while the H+ generated by &#8722;COOH can inhibit the deprotonation of organic cations and subsequent amine&#8208;cation reaction. The above degradation reactions are simultaneously inhibited by the synergy of functional groups. The inverted device achieves an efficiency of 23.5&#8201;% (certified efficiency of 23.3&#8201;%) with an excellent operational stability, retaining 94&#8201;% of the initial efficiency after maximum power point tracking for 601&#8197;hours.

   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;-based inverted device achieves a certified efficiency of 23.3&#8201;% with excellent operational stability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perovskite solar cells suffer from poor reproducibility due to the degradation of perovskite precursor solution. Herein, we report an effective precursor stabilization strategy via incorporating 3-hydrazinobenzoic acid (3-HBA) containing carboxyl (&#8722;COOH) and hydrazine (&#8722;NHNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) functional groups as stabilizer. The oxidation of I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, deprotonation of organic cations and amine-cation reaction are the main causes of the degradation of mixed organic cation perovskite precursor solution. The &#8722;NHNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can reduce I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; defects back to I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and thus suppress the oxidation of I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, while the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; generated by &#8722;COOH can inhibit the deprotonation of organic cations and subsequent amine-cation reaction. The above degradation reactions are simultaneously inhibited by the synergy of functional groups. The inverted device achieves an efficiency of 23.5&#8201;% (certified efficiency of 23.3&#8201;%) with an excellent operational stability, retaining 94&#8201;% of the initial efficiency after maximum power point tracking for 601&#8197;hours.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mediating CO2 Electroreduction Activity and Selectivity over Atomically Precise Copper Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A group of atomically precise Cu8 cluster isomers with two core structures (cube&#8208; and ditetrahedron&#8208;shaped) were investigated for highly active and selective CO2 reduction. A difference in catalytic performance was attributed to variable metal core arrangements hidden in Cu8 nanoclusters. The ditetrahedron&#8208;shaped cluster exhibits a high Faradaic efficiency for formic acid generation (FEHCOOH) almost two times that of the cube&#8208;shaped cluster.







Abstract
Atomically precise copper clusters are highly desirable catalysts for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and provide an ideal platform for elaborating structure&#8211;activity relationships. However, systematic comparative studies of Cu cluster isomers for electrocatalytic CO2RR are lacking because they are challenging to synthesize. A group of structurally precise Cu8 cluster isomers with different core structures (cube&#8208; and ditetrahedron&#8208;shaped) were developed and investigated for highly active and selective CO2 reduction. Electrocatalytic measurements showed that the ditetrahedron&#8208;shaped Cu8 cluster exhibited a higher FEHCOOH (&#8776;92&#8201;%) at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V and higher selectivity than the cube&#8208;shaped cluster. Theoretical investigations revealed different levels of competitiveness with the hydrogen evolution reaction on the respective core&#8208;shaped Cu8 clusters and decreased free energies for the adsorbed HCOO* intermediates on the ditetrahedron&#8208;shaped Cu8 clusters.

         <title>Highly Active and Thermally Robust Nickel Enolate Catalysts for the Synthesis of Ethylene&#8208;Acrylate Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of polar functionalities into the polyethylene backbone via coordination copolymerization can provide value&#8208;added polyolefins with improved properties. Nickel enolate catalysts with steric constraints in the axial positions were developed and applied to polyolefin synthesis. They are highly active (up to 7.7&#215;103&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and thermally stable in ethylene/acrylate copolymerization, and their behavior correlates with the level of axial shielding.







Abstract
The insertion copolymerization of polar olefins and ethylene remains a significant challenge in part due to catalysts&#8242; low activity and poor thermal stability. Herein we demonstrate a strategy toward addressing these obstacles through ligand design. Neutral nickel phosphine enolate catalysts with large phosphine substituents reaching the axial positions of Ni achieve activity of up to 7.7&#215;103&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 (efficiency &gt;35&#215;103&#8197;g copolymer/g Ni) at 110&#8201;&#176;C, notable for ethylene/acrylate copolymerization. NMR analysis of resulting copolymers reveals highly linear microstructures with main&#8208;chain ester functionality. Structure&#8208;performance studies indicate a strong correlation between axial steric hindrance and catalyst performance.

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Interpretable Descriptors for the Structure&#8211;Activity Relationship of Surface Lattice Oxygen on Doped Vanadium Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Data&#8208;driven interpretable descriptors were constructed to predict the redox activity of surface lattice oxygen on doped vanadium oxides by combining density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML). Based on descriptors, physical insights into the structure&#8211;activity relationships were obtained and further guided the experimental verification of efficient redox catalysts for chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL&#8208;ODH) of propane.







Abstract
Understanding the structure&#8211;activity relationship of surface lattice oxygen is critical but challenging to design efficient redox catalysts. This paper describes data&#8208;driven redox activity descriptors on doped vanadium oxides combining density functional theory and interpretable machine learning. We corroborate that the p&#8208;band center is the most crucial feature for the activity. Besides, some features from the coordination environment, including unoccupied d&#8208;band center, s&#8208; and d&#8208;band fillings, also play important roles in tuning the oxygen activity. Further analysis reveals that data&#8208;driven descriptors could decode more information about electron transfer during the redox process. Based on the descriptors, we report that atomic Re&#8208; and W&#8208;doping could inhibit over&#8208;oxidation in the chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, which is verified by subsequent experiments and calculations. This work sheds light on the structure&#8211;activity relationship of lattice oxygen for the rational design of redox catalysts.

A bioinspired clickable selenylation reaction of indole has been developed by using benzoselenazole as selenylation reagent under nonmetallic B(C6F5)3 catalysis. The practical application of the reaction has been well demonstrated in on&#8208;DNA and on&#8208;microplate parallel synthesis of indole&#8208;selenides.







Abstract
Click chemistry is a concept wherein modular synthesis is used for rapid functional discovery. To this end, continuous discovery of clickable chemical transformations is the pillar to support the development of this field. This report details the development of a clickable C3&#8208;H selenylation of indole that is suitable for on&#8208;plate parallel and DNA&#8208;encoded library (SeDEL) synthesis via bioinspired LUMO activation strategy. This reaction is modular, robust and highly site&#8208;selective, and it features a simple and mild reaction system (catalyzed by nonmetallic B(C6F5)3 at room temperature), high yields and excellent functional group compatibility. Using this method, a library of 1350 indole&#8208;selenides was parallel synthesized in an efficient and practical manner, enabling the rapid identification of 3&#8201;ai as a promising compound with nanomolar antiproliferative activity in cancer cells via in situ phenotypic screening. These results indicate the great potential of this new clickable selenylation reaction in high&#8208;throughput medicinal chemistry and chemical biology.

Macrocyclic nor&#8208;seco&#8208;cucurbit[10]uril functions as an efficient adsorption separation material for the removal of pyridine from toluene and benzene, achieving &gt;99.9&#8201;% purity of the separated compounds. Thermal release of pyridine allows the ns&#8208;Q[10] separation material to be cycled at least 10&#8197;times without erosion of performance.







Abstract
Benzene, toluene and pyridine are widely used as essential raw materials in industry and laboratory research, with stringent purity requirements. Herein, we show that solid double&#8208;cavity host nor&#8208;seco&#8208;cucurbit[10]uril (ns&#8208;Q[10]) functions as an efficient adsorption separator for pyridine; benzene and toluene can be obtained in &gt;99.9&#8201;% purity by this method. Thermal removal of pyridine from ns&#8208;Q[10]&#8901;Py2 allows 10 separation cycles without erosion of performance. The geometry of the ns&#8208;Q[10]&#8901;Py2 ternary complex was established by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction methods. The ns&#8208;Q[10] cage facilitates the removal of pyridine from toluene and benzene, with &gt;99.9&#8201;% purity for the separated compounds.

         <title>Synergistic Mechanism of Platinum&#8208;GaOx Catalysts for Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic mechanism of Pt&#8208;modified Ga2O3 for propane dehydrogenation is discussed. The presence of Pt can assist H2 dissociation and increase the surface coverage of hydrogen species, which promotes the propylene production. The research provides guidance for the rational design of metal&#8211;metal oxide catalysts.







Abstract
The synergy between metals and metal oxides can effectively improve the heterogeneous catalytic process. This paper describes the intrinsic effect of Pt modification over GaOx (Pt&#8722;GaOx) on propane dehydrogenation. The presence of Pt promotes H2 dissociation and surface coverage of hydrogen species, which is beneficial for the activation of C&#8722;H in propane. With excessive Pt, Ga&#948;+ can be further reduced to form Pt&#8722;Ga alloy with less surface hydrogen species. Consequently, the relative propylene formation rate between Pt&#8722;GaOx and the summed contribution of individual Pt and GaOx increases linearly with the content of hydrogen species. Optimally, the relative propylene formation rate of Pt&#8722;GaOx with 0.03&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pt exceeds 25&#8201;% of the summed contribution of individual components.

         <title>A pH&#8208;Driven Small&#8208;Molecule Nanotransformer Hijacks Lysosomes and Overcomes Autophagy&#8208;Induced Resistance in Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lysosomal targeting nonpeptide PBC (pheophorbide a&#8211;bisaminoquinoline conjugate) self&#8208;assembles into nanoparticles at physiological pH and then transforms into nanofibrils upon the trigger of lysosomal pH. Due to such shape transformation, PBC not only inhibits tumor growth as a single agent but also mediates a convenient photodynamic therapy with promise to overcome the autophagy&#8208;induced resistance and achieve tumor ablation.







Abstract
Smart conversion of supramolecular structures in vivo is an attractive strategy in cancer nanomedicine, which is usually achieved via specific peptide sequences. Here we developed a lysosomal targeting small&#8208;molecule conjugate, PBC, which self&#8208;assembles into nanoparticles at physiological pH and smartly converts to nanofibrils in lysosomes of tumor cells. Such a transformation mechanically leads to lysosomal dysfunction, autophagy inhibition, and unusual cytoplasmic vacuolation, thus granting PBC a unique anticancer activity as a monotherapy. Importantly, the photo&#8208;activated PBC elicits significant phototoxicity to lysosomes and shows enormous advantages in overcoming autophagy&#8208;caused treatment resistance frequently occurring in conventional phototherapy. This improved phototherapy achieves a complete cure of oral cancer xenografts upon limited administration. Our work provides a new paradigm for the construction of nonpeptide nanotransformers with biomedical activities.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Preparation and Moderate Congruent Melting Temperature of Layered Lead Iodide Perovskites for Thin&#8208;Film Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multilayered halide perovskites are prepared from a solvent&#8208;free liquid&#8208;solid reaction involving a layered perovskite in the molten state and (CH3NH3)PbI3 (MAPI) in the solid state. These layered halide perovskites based on HO2C(CH2)3NH3+ cations exhibit congruent melting at moderate temperatures (126&#8201;&#176;C for the lower) allowing the preparation of melt&#8208;processed thin films.







Abstract
Lead halide 2D hybrid perovskites (HP) have emerged as promising materials for photovoltaic and lighting applications. Solvent&#8208;free preparations offer greener route, but require congruent melting of halide perovskite for thin films, which has been demonstrated only for monolayered HP (n=1 of the (A)2(MA)n&#8722;1PbnI3n+1 series) at the quite high temperature Tm (Tmelting) of 171&#8201;&#176;C. Here, we report on the solvent&#8208;free preparation (n=2, 4), thermal behaviour and melt&#8208;processed thin films of a series of HP (GABA)2(MA)n&#8722;1PbnI3n+1 (n=1, 2, 4; GABA+: 4&#8208;ammoniumbutyric acid cation). The n=1 and n=2 HP have an exceptional low congruent Tm of 126&#8201;&#176;C and 136&#8201;&#176;C, respectively, and, for n=1, a very good stability in the molten state. The liquid&#8211;solid reaction of molten (GABA)2PbI4 or (GABA)2(MA)Pb2I7 with MAPbI3 in 1/1 (T=130&#8201;&#176;C) or 1/2 (T=135&#8201;&#176;C) ratio leads to pure phases of the n=2 HP and (GABA)2(MA)3Pb4I11 (n=4, Tm=185&#8201;&#176;C), respectively. Melt&#8208;processed thin films of n=1, n=2 and n=4 HP have also been prepared.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Dependent Supramolecular Host&#8211;Guest Assemblies of Platinum(II) Tweezers and a Guest System: From Discrete Molecules to High&#8208;Ordered Oligomers</title>

The host&#8211;guest assembly process of a platinum(II) tweezers&#8211;guest system can be controlled by varying the solvent composition. The change in the assembly behavior from discrete host and guest molecules to high&#8208;ordered host&#8211;guest oligomers can be probed by drastic changes in the color from yellow to orange to green, demonstrating a three&#8208;state supramolecular system with potential application as a colorimetric micro&#8208;environment sensor.







Abstract
A series of platinum(II) calix[4]arene&#8208;based molecular tweezers was synthesized. The studies of the host&#8211;guest association with a charge&#8208;neutral cyclometalated platinum(II) complex showed a drastic color change and the turning on of near&#8208;infrared emission resulting from Pt&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. Control of the host&#8211;guest assembly process by varying the solvent composition can lead to a change from discrete host and guest molecules to high&#8208;ordered host&#8211;guest oligomers with the formation of sheet&#8208;like nanostructures, demonstrating a rare example of three&#8208;state supramolecular host&#8211;guest system with high solubility in solvents of diverse polarity. The change in host&#8211;guest assembly behaviors could be probed by drastic color changes from yellow to orange to green. The present study provides insights into the systematic design of solvent&#8208;responsive molecular materials using molecular tweezers&#8208;directed host&#8211;guest assembly, with potential applications in colorimetric sensing of changes in the micro&#8208;environment.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Glidomides and Elucidation of Different Mechanisms for Formation of &#946;&#8208;OH Amino Acid Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glidomides include two unusual amino acid residues: threo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;OH&#8208;L&#8208;His and threo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;OH&#8208;D&#8208;Asp. GlmD independently catalyzes the hydroxylation of L&#8208;Asp to primarily produce threo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;OH&#8208;L&#8208;Asp on the thiolation domain and then undergoes epimerization to form threo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;OH&#8208;D&#8208;Asp in the final products. The &#946;&#8208;hydroxylation of His requires the concerted action of GlmF and the interface (I) domain, a novel condensation domain family clade.







Abstract
Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) can incorporate nonproteinogenic amino acids into peptidyl backbones to increase structural diversity. Genome mining of Schlegelella brevitalea led to the identification of a class of linear lipoheptapeptides, glidomides, featuring two unusual residues: threo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;OH&#8208;L&#8208;His and threo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;OH&#8208;D&#8208;Asp. The &#946;&#8208;hydroxylation of Asp and His is catalyzed by the nonheme FeII/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent &#946;&#8208;hydroxylases GlmD and GlmF, respectively. GlmD independently catalyzes the hydroxylation of L&#8208;Asp to primarily produce threo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;OH&#8208;L&#8208;Asp on the thiolation domain, and then undergoes epimerization to form threo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;OH&#8208;D&#8208;Asp in the final products. However, &#946;&#8208;hydroxylation of His requires the concerted action of GlmF and the interface (I) domain, a novel condensation domain family clade. The key sites of I domain for interaction with GlmF were identified, suggesting that the mechanism for hydroxylation of His depends on the collaboration between hydroxylase and NRPS.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Orientation of Magnetic Double Stacks for Patterned Anisotropic Hydrogels with Multiple Responses and Modulable Motions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;response anisotropic hydrogels are developed by using a rotating magnetic field to orient the magnetic double stacks (MDSs) with &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 nanoparticles sandwiched by two nanosheets. Patterned gels with sophisticated orientations of MDSs are fabricated by multi&#8208;step magnetic orientation and photolithographic polymerization, which exhibit programmed deformations and motions under synergetic actuations.







Abstract
Reported here is a multi&#8208;response anisotropic poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) hydrogel developed by using a rotating magnetic field to align magnetic double stacks (MDSs) that are fixed by polymerization. The magneto&#8208;orientation of MDSs originates from the unique structure with &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 nanoparticles sandwiched by two silicate nanosheets. The resultant gels not only exhibit anisotropic optical and mechanical properties but also show anisotropic responses to temperature and light. Gels with complex ordered structures of MDSs are further devised by multi&#8208;step magnetic orientation and photolithographic polymerization. These gels show varied birefringence patterns with potentials as information materials, and can deform into specific configurations upon stimulations. Multi&#8208;gait motions are further realized in the patterned gel through dynamic deformation under spatiotemporal light and friction regulation by imposed magnetic force. The magneto&#8208;orientation assisted fabrication of hydrogels with anisotropic structures and additional functions should bring opportunities for gel materials in biomedical devices, soft actuators/robots, etc.

         <title>Regioselective Seeded Polymerization in Block Copolymer Nanoparticles: Post&#8208;Assembly Control of Colloidal Features</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
It's all about location: A new synthetic platform confines seeded polymerizations to one specific domain type in phase&#8208;separated block copolymer particles. Starting from one set of preformed particles, this post&#8208;assembly modification method enables accurate control over colloidal shape, morphology, and chemical functionality.







Abstract
Post&#8208;assembly modifications are efficient tools to adjust colloidal features of block copolymer (BCP) particles. However, existing methods often address particle shape, morphology, and chemical functionality individually. For simultaneous control, we transferred the concept of seeded polymerization to phase separated BCP particles. Key to our approach is the regioselective polymerization of (functional) monomers inside specific BCP domains. This was demonstrated in striped PS&#8208;b&#8208;P2VP ellipsoids. Here, polymerization of styrene preferably occurs in PS domains and increases PS lamellar thickness up to 5&#8208;fold. The resulting asymmetric lamellar morphology also changes the particle shape, i.e., increases the aspect ratio. Using 4&#8208;vinylbenzyl azide as co&#8208;monomer, azides as chemical functionalities can be added selectively to the PS domains. Overall, our simple and versatile method gives access to various multifunctional BCP colloids from a single batch of pre&#8208;formed particles.

         <title>Tuning the Interlayer Interactions of 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks Enables an Ultrastable Platform for Anhydrous Proton Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrastable and anhydrous covalent organic framework (COF)&#8208;based proton conductor is prepared by tuning the interlayer interaction via importing planar and rigid triazine units into the center of C3&#8208;symmetric monomers. This work provides a solution to the instability of imine&#8208;linked COFs and contributes to the design and development of COF&#8208;based energy&#8208;related devices with proton&#8208;transport systems.







Abstract
The development of effective, stable anhydrous proton&#8208;conductive materials is vital but challenging. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising platforms for ion and molecule conduction owing to their pre&#8208;designable structures and tailor&#8208;made functionalities. However, their poor chemical stability is due to weak interlayer interactions and intrinsic reversibility of linkages.

     alt="Tuning the Interlayer Interactions of 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks Enables an Ultrastable Platform for Anhydrous Proton Transport"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ultrastable and anhydrous covalent organic framework (COF)-based proton conductor is prepared by tuning the interlayer interaction via importing planar and rigid triazine units into the center of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric monomers. This work provides a solution to the instability of imine-linked COFs and contributes to the design and development of COF-based energy-related devices with proton-transport systems.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of effective, stable anhydrous proton-conductive materials is vital but challenging. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising platforms for ion and molecule conduction owing to their pre-designable structures and tailor-made functionalities. However, their poor chemical stability is due to weak interlayer interactions and intrinsic reversibility of linkages. Herein, we present a strategy for enhancing the interlayer interactions of two-dimensional COFs via importing planar, rigid triazine units into the center of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric monomers. The developed triazine-core-based COF (denoted as TPT-COF) possesses a well-defined crystalline structure, ordered nanochannels, and prominent porosity. The proton conductivity was &#8776;10 times those of non-triazinyl COFs, even reaching up to 1.27&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 160&#8201;&#176;C. Furthermore, the TPT-COF exhibited structural ultrastability, making it an effective proton transport platform with remarkable conductivity and long-term durability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study of hypervalent chalcogenonium&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bonding catalysis was performed. A new catalytic strategy using 1,2&#8208;oxaselenolium salts as chalcogen bond donors and alkenes as chalcogen bond acceptors is described. The feasibility of this concept is demonstrated by the use of trisubstituted selenonium salts in the metal&#8208;free catalytic hydrofunctionalization and polymerization of alkenes via unconventional seleniranium ion&#8208;like intermediates. The results indicate that counter anions have a significant effect on the catalysis based on hypervalent chalcogenonium&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bonding interactions.

         <title>Template&#8208;Guided Regioselective Encaging of Platinum Single Atoms into Y Zeolite: Enhanced Selectivity in Semihydrogenation and Resistance to Poisoning</title>

         <dc:description>
Single platinum atoms were selectively encaged into six&#8208;membered rings of sodalite cages within Y zeolite with the aid of a template&#8208;guiding method. The catalyst exhibited good selectivity and stability, and excellent resistance to poisoning in semihydrogenation reactions.







Abstract
It is challenging to establish single metal atoms with a uniform coordination environment at targeted sites of a zeolite. In this study, single platinum atoms were selectively encaged in the six&#8208;membered rings of sodalite (SOD) cages within Y zeolite using a template&#8208;guiding strategy. During the in&#8197;situ synthesis process, template molecules were designed to occupy supercages and thereby force coordinated platinum species into SOD cages. Subsequent control of the post&#8208;treatment conditions yielded the Y zeolite with selectively encaged single platinum atoms, denoted Pt@Y&#8208;SOD. The Pt@Y&#8208;SOD catalyst had good stability and excellent catalytic selectivity in the semihydrogenation reaction, and it exhibited interesting thiophene and carbon monoxide resistance in this transformation because interactions with these poisons are weakened by the configuration of the encaged single platinum atoms.

         <title>CO2 Capture by Hybrid Ultramicroporous TIFSIX&#8208;3&#8208;Ni under Humid Conditions Using Non&#8208;Equilibrium Cycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insight into co&#8208;adsorption of CO2 and H2O by the metal&#8211;organic framework TIFSIX&#8208;3&#8208;Ni, a high CO2 affinity hybrid ultramicroporous material (HUM), is provided by in situ infrared spectroscopy and ab initio calculations. The results challenge the hypothesis that materials with narrow pores are unsuitable for adsorbing multiple sorbates due to steric hindrance and/or molecular competition. CO2 and H2O in HUMs can play a duet instead of fighting a duel.







Abstract
Although pyrazine&#8208;linked hybrid ultramicroporous materials (HUMs, pore size &lt;7&#8197;&#197;) are benchmark physisorbents for trace carbon dioxide (CO2) capture under dry conditions, their affinity for water (H2O) mitigates their carbon capture performance in humid conditions. Herein, we report on the co&#8208;adsorption of H2O and CO2 by TIFSIX&#8208;3&#8208;Ni&#8212;a high CO2 affinity HUM&#8212;and find that slow H2O sorption kinetics can enable CO2 uptake and release using shortened adsorption cycles with retention of ca. 90&#8201;% of dry CO2 uptake. Insight into co&#8208;adsorption is provided by in situ infrared spectroscopy and ab initio calculations. The binding sites and sorption mechanisms reveal that both CO2 and H2O molecules occupy the same ultramicropore through favorable interactions between CO2 and H2O at low water loading. An energetically favored water network displaces CO2 molecules at higher loading. Our results offer bottom&#8208;up design principles and insight into co&#8208;adsorption of CO2 and H2O that is likely to be relevant across the full spectrum of carbon capture sorbents to better understand and address the challenge posed by humidity to gas capture.

         <title>Direct Oxygen Transfer from H2O to Cyclooctene over Electron&#8208;Rich RuO2 Nanocrystals for Epoxidation and Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron enrichment of metallic RuO2 nanocrystals can boost the highly selective epoxidation of cyclooctene via direct oxygen transfer from sustainable water, which is the sole oxygen source under ambient conditions. An efficient hydrogen evolution reaction is also enabled on the counter cathode without sacrificing the high selectivity to epoxide on the working electrode.







Abstract
Production of more than 20&#8197;million tons of epoxides per year from olefins suffers from low atom economy due to the use of oxidants and complex catalysts with unsatisfactory selectivity, leading to huge environmental and economic costs. We present a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application of electron&#8208;rich RuO2 nanocrystals to boost the highly selective epoxidation of cyclooctene via direct oxygen transfer from water as the sole oxygen source under mild conditions. The enhanced electron enrichment of RuO2 nanocrystals via the Schottky effect with nitrogen&#8208;doped carbons largely promotes the capture and activation of cyclooctene to give a high turnover frequency (260&#8197;h&#8722;1) of cyclooctene oxide, far surpassing the reported values (&lt;20&#8197;h&#8722;1) of benchmarked catalysts at room temperature with oxidants. Our electron&#8208;rich RuO2 electrocatalysts enable efficient and durable hydrogen production (Faradaic efficiency &gt;90&#8201;%) on the cathode without impacting on the selectivity to epoxide (&gt;99&#8201;%) on the anode.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical synthetic route to nonsymmetrical thiophene&#8208;fused aromatic systems was inspired by the biodegradation of benzothiophene. Excellent fluorescence characteristics of a series of &#960;&#8208;conjugated benzo[b]naphtho[1,2&#8208;d]thiophene (BNT) sulfoxides were observed both in solution and in the solid state. Fluorescence variation with different Br&#248;nsted acids illustrates the high application potential of these compounds.

         <title>Anode&#8208;Free Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Cells Enabled by Rationally Tuning Lithium Polysulfide Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>

A complexation reaction between metal iodide and lithium polysulfides in the electrolyte enables an effective stabilization of the anode with enhanced sulfur utilization in anode&#8208;free lithium&#8211;sulfur cells with lithium sulfide cathode.







Abstract
The two major barriers of practical lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries are the poor reversibility of lithium&#8208;metal anode and sluggish kinetics of sulfur cathode. Here, we report a simple yet cogent, molecular tailoring approach for lithium polysulfides, enabling a synergistic enhancement of anode reversibility and cathode kinetics. We show that SnI4 coordinates with lithium polysulfides to form soluble complexes, resulting in a Li2SnS3&#8208;rich anode interphase layer. As Li2SnS3 is stable against parasitic reactions and has a lower ionic resistance over cycling, the Li plating/stripping efficiency is greatly improved. In addition, the formation of soluble complexes between SnI4 and lithium polysulfides play a non&#8208;negligible role in suppressing the clustering behavior of lithium polysulfide molecules, resulting in a significant enhancement in sulfur conversion kinetics under lean electrolyte conditions. The synergistic improvement is validated in anode&#8208;free, lean&#8208;electrolyte pouch cells with a Li2S cathode that displays capacity retention of 78&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Guest&#8208;Modulated Circularly Polarized Luminescence by Ligand&#8208;to&#8208;Ligand Chirality Transfer in Heteroleptic PdII Coordination Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrative self&#8208;assembly of PdII cations with an enantiopure helicene&#8208;based ligand and non&#8208;chiral but emissive fluorenone ligands yields a series of Pd2L2L&#8242;2 heteroleptic coordination cages, showing circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from the non&#8208;chiral moiety. Modulation of the chiroptical properties is achieved by ligand modification or guest binding, achieving an up to 4&#8208;fold enhancement of CPL intensity.







Abstract
Multicomponent metallo&#8208;supramolecular assembly allows the rational combination of different building blocks. Discrete multifunctional hosts with an accessible cavity can be prepared in a non&#8208;statistical fashion. We employ our shape&#8208;complementary assembly (SCA) method to achieve for the first time integrative self&#8208;sorting of heteroleptic PdII cages showing guest&#8208;tunable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). An enantiopure helicene&#8208;based ligand (M or P configuration) is coupled with a non&#8208;chiral emissive fluorenone&#8208;based ligand (A or B) to form a series of Pd2L2L&#8242;2 assemblies. The modular strategy allows to impart the chiral information of the helicenes to the overall supramolecular system, resulting in CPL from the non&#8208;chiral component. Guest binding results in a 4&#8208;fold increase of CPL intensity. The principle offers potential to generate libraries of multifunctional materials with applications in molecular recognition, enantioselective photo&#8208;redox catalysis and information processing.

         <title>Enhancing Li+ Transport in NMC811||Graphite Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries at Low Temperatures by Using Low&#8208;Polarity&#8208;Solvent Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;polarity&#8208;solvent electrolytes (LPSEs) 1) enable the formation of the anion&#8208;derived interphases on both electrodes and 2) have weak interactions between the solvent molecules and Li+, which provide fast Li+ transport kinetics and reduced resistance in both charge transfer process and Li+ transport in electrode/electrolyte interphases, achieving excellent battery performance under both fast&#8208;charge and low&#8208;temperature conditions.







Abstract
LiNixCoyMnzO2 (x+y+z=1)||graphite lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) chemistry promises practical applications. However, its low&#8208;temperature (&#8804; &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C) performance is poor because the increased resistance encountered by Li+ transport in and across the bulk electrolytes and the electrolyte/electrode interphases induces capacity loss and battery failures. Though tremendous efforts have been made, there is still no effective way to reduce the charge transfer resistance (Rct) which dominates low&#8208;temperature LIBs performance. Herein, we propose a strategy of using low&#8208;polarity&#8208;solvent electrolytes which have weak interactions between the solvents and the Li+ to reduce Rct, achieving facile Li+ transport at sub&#8208;zero temperatures. The exemplary electrolyte enables LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2||graphite cells to deliver a capacity of &#8776;113&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (98&#8201;% full&#8208;cell capacity) at 25&#8201;&#176;C and to remain 82&#8201;% of their room&#8208;temperature capacity at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C without lithium plating at 1/3C. They also retain 84&#8201;% of their capacity at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C and 78&#8201;% of their capacity at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C and show stable cycling at 50&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Photoelectrochemical Conversion of Dinitrogen to Benzonitrile: Selectivity Control by Electrophile&#8208; versus Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy for the conversion of N2 to benzonitrile within a simple two&#8208;step cycle is demonstrated. Photoelectrochemical, reductive splitting of N2 is mediated by a Re pincer complex. The resulting ReV nitride undergoes electrochemical N&#8208;atom transfer in the presence of benzoyl bromide and acid at mild potentials. The high selectivity with respect to nitrile formation is attributed to the unfavorable thermochemistry of proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) to the nitride.







Abstract
Nitride complexes are key species in homogeneous nitrogen fixation to NH3 via stepwise proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET). In contrast, direct generation of nitrogenous organic products from N2&#8208;derived nitrides requires new strategies to enable efficient reductive nitride transfer in the presence of organic electrophiles. We here present a 2&#8208;step protocol for the conversion of dinitrogen to benzonitrile. Photoelectrochemical, reductive N2 splitting produces a rhenium(V) nitride with unfavorable PCET thermochemistry towards ammonia generation. However, N&#8208;benzoylation stabilizes subsequent reduction as a basis for selective nitrogen transfer in the presence of the organic electrophile and Br&#248;nsted acid at mild reduction potentials. This work offers a new strategy for photoelectrosynthetic nitrogen fixation beyond ammonia&#8212;to yield nitrogenous organic products.

         <title>Double&#8208;Cable Conjugated Polymers with Pendent Near&#8208;Infrared Electron Acceptors for Single&#8208;Component Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>

Symmetric and asymmetric near&#8208;infrared double&#8208;cable conjugated polymers based on a non&#8208;fused&#8208;ring thieno[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole&#8208;4,6&#8208;dione (TPD) core with 2&#8208;(3&#8208;oxo&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydroinden&#8208;1&#8208;ylidene)malononitrile (IC) side units were successfully synthesized for application in single&#8208;component organic solar cells (SCOSCs). The asymmetric polymer exhibited improved hole mobility, leading to SCOSCs with high quantum efficiencies over 0.80 and power conversion efficiencies over 10&#8201;%.







Abstract
Double&#8208;cable conjugated polymers with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) electron acceptors are synthesized for use in single&#8208;component organic solar cells (SCOSCs). Through the development of a judicious synthetic pathway, the highly sensitive nature of the 2&#8208;(3&#8208;oxo&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydroinden&#8208;1&#8208;ylidene)malononitrile (IC)&#8208;based electron acceptors in basic and protonic solvents is overcome. In addition, an asymmetric design motif is adopted to optimize the packing of donor and acceptor segments, enhancing charge separation efficiency. As such, the new double&#8208;cable polymers are successfully applied in SCOSCs, providing an efficiency of over 10&#8201;% with a broad photo response from 300 to 850&#8197;nm and exhibiting excellent thermal/light stability. These results demonstrate the powerful design of NIR&#8208;acceptor&#8208;based double&#8208;cable polymers and will enable SCOSCs to enter a new stage.

         <title>A Real&#8208;Time In Situ Demonstration of Direct and Indirect Transformation Pathways in CdTe Magic&#8208;Size Clusters at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
When CdTe MSC&#8208;448 transforms to MSC&#8208;488, the redshift of optical absorption that is monitored in real&#8208;time displays continuous (Pattern 1) and/or step&#8208;wise behavior (Pattern 2). The former transformation (Pathway 1) is direct and intra&#8208;cluster with a relatively large energy barrier. The latter transformation (Pathway 2) is indirect and assisted by MSC precursor compounds (PCs).







Abstract
The transformations of colloidal semiconductor magic&#8208;size clusters (MSCs) are expected to occur with only discrete, step&#8208;wise redshifts in optical absorption. Here, we challenge this assumption presenting a novel, conceptually different transformation, for which the redshift is continuous. In the room&#8208;temperature transformation from CdTe MSC&#8208;448 to MSC&#8208;488 (designated by the peak wavelengths in nanometer), the redshift of absorption monitored in situ displays distinctly continuous and/or step&#8208;wise behavior. Based on conclusive evidence provided by real&#8208;time experiments, the former transformation is apparently direct and intra&#8208;cluster with a relatively large energy barrier. The latter transformation is indirect and assisted by MSC precursor compounds (PCs). The former transformation follows the latter often, being predominant at a relatively high temperature. The present findings encourage a reconsideration of the absorption redshift reported previously for transformations of binary II&#8211;VI MSCs, together with the pathway associated without the increase of cluster mass.

Triplet energy transfer from perovskite nanocrystals can drive a host of organic isomerization and cycloaddition reactions, under much milder conditions than photoredox catalysis.







Abstract
A relatively new addition to the application portfolio of lead halide perovskites is to photosensitize molecular triplets for a variety of photochemical applications. Here we report visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven isomerization and cycloaddition of organic molecules sensitized by spectrally&#8208;tunable perovskite nanocrystals. We first demonstrate with stilbene as the substrate molecule that photoisomerization can proceed efficiently and rapidly by either directly grafting carboxylated stilbene onto nanocrystal surfaces or using triplet&#8211;acceptor ligands as the energy relay. The relay approach is more generally applicable as it does not require anchoring&#8208;group functionalization of substrate molecules, allowing us to facilely extend it to isomerization of a series of substituted stilbene molecules and ring&#8208;closing isomerization of diarylethene, as well as intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition of acenaphthylene. This study opens an avenue of energy&#8208;transfer photocatalysis using perovskite nanocrystals.

A small synthetic artificial enzyme &#160;is able to accomplish, for the first time, the transesterification of non&#8208;activated esters under neutral and mild conditions. Inspired by the catalytic machinery of chymotrypsin and N&#8208;terminal hydrolases, Jos&#233;&#8197;J. Garrido&#8208;Gonz&#225;lez, &#193;ngel&#8197;L. Fuentes&#8197;de&#8197;Arriba et&#8197;al. show in their Research Article (e202206072) that a small molecule which mimics the catalytic triad and oxyanion hole of hydrolases can emulate in a test tube the catalytic properties of hydrolytic enzymes.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Ultrathin Covalent Organic Framework Anchored on Graphene for Enhanced Organic Pollutant Removal (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 35/2022)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin covalent organic framework (COF) was constructed homogeneously on the surface of a graphene template via a facile hydrothermal method, as reported by Freddy Kleitz and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202206564). Benefitting from the maximum exposure of active sites and sufficient interaction with target water pollutants, the ultrathin COF could effectively shorten the equilibrium time and increase the adsorption capacity for the removal of organic dyes with various sizes.

Intra&#8208;assembly chirality transfer &#160;from a helicene onto a non&#8208;chiral, emissive fluorenone ligand leads to circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in a heteroleptic coordination cage. The Research Article (e202205725) by Guido H. Clever et&#8197;al. shows that guest addition shifts and enhances the CPL effect, providing a modular platform for supramolecular materials with tunable chiroptical properties. The background, showing the "North America" emission nebula (NGC 7000) in the constellation Cygnus, was shot in the night sky over Dortmund using an apochromatic refractor telescope.

         <title>Organometallic Synthesis of Magnetic Metal Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic metal nanoparticles (MMNPs) have great potential in a multitude of applications such as catalysis, biomedicine and environmental remediation. This Minireview highlights advances over the last two decades in the organometallic synthesis of MMNPs. The resulting MMNPs have tailor&#8208;made sizes, shapes, compositions and magnetic properties, leading to their application in magnetically induced catalysis and biosensing.







Abstract
Magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) are attractive both for their fundamental properties and for their potential in a variety of applications ranging from nanomedicine and biology to micro/nanoelectronics and catalysis. While these fields are dominated by the use of iron oxides, reduced metal NPs are of interest since they display high magnetization and adjustable anisotropy according to their size, shape and composition. The use of organometallic precursors makes it possible to adjust the size, shape (sphere, cube, rod, wire, urchin, &#8230;) and composition (alloys, core&#8211;shell, composition gradient, dumbbell, &#8230;) of the resulting NPs and hence their magnetic properties. We discuss here the synthesis of magnetic metal NPs from organometallic precursors carried out in Toulouse, as well as their associated properties and their potential in applications.

         <title>Electrochemical Reactors for Continuous Decentralized H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical reactors for continuous decentralized H2O2 production are described in this Minireview, with separate discussions of flow field plates, catalyst layers, gas diffusion layers, membranes, shapes, and electrolyte compartments. The key factors of these parts and the optimization strategies for assembling flow cells are summarized. Insights and perspectives on key components are given.







Abstract
The global utilization of H2O2 is currently around 4 million tons per year and is expected to continue to increase in the future. H2O2 is mainly produced by the anthraquinone process, which involves multiple steps in terms of alkylanthraquinone hydrogenation/oxidation in organic solvents and liquid&#8211;liquid extraction of H2O2. The energy&#8208;intensive and environmentally unfriendly anthraquinone process does not meet the requirements of sustainable and low&#8208;carbon development. The electrocatalytic two&#8208;electron (2&#8201;e&#8722;) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) driven by renewable energy (e.g. solar and wind power) offers a more economical, low&#8208;carbon, and greener route to produce H2O2. However, continuous and decentralized H2O2 electrosynthesis still poses many challenges. This Minireview first summarizes the development of devices for H2O2 electrosynthesis, and then introduces each component, the assembly process, and some optimization strategies.

         <title>Odorant Metabolism in Humans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complete passage and turnover of odorants within the human organism, beginning with the various routes of odorant uptake, followed by biotransformation and excretion are delineated in this Review. Special emphasis is placed on a comparison of the involved enzymes concerning the nasal, oral, respiratory tract and gastrointestinal metabolism of odorants and the respective functions of odorant metabolism in these body sites.







Abstract
Odorants are relatively small molecules which are easily taken up and distributed in the human body. Despite their relevance in everyday life, however, only a limited amount of evidence about their metabolism, pathways, and bioactivities in the human body exists. With this Review, we aim to encourage future interdisciplinary research on the function and mechanisms of the biotransformation of odorants, involving different disciplines such as nutrition, medicine, biochemistry, chemistry, and sensory sciences. Starting with a general overview of the different ways of odorant uptake and enzymes involved in the metabolism of odorants, a more precise description of biotransformation processes and their function in the oral cavity, the nose, the lower respiratory tract (LRT), and the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is given together with an overview of the different routes of odorant excretion. Finally, perspectives for future research are discussed.

         <title>Stabilization of Imines and Hemiaminals in Water by an Endo&#8208;Functionalized Container Molecule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amine&#8208;functionalized naphthotube featuring a cavity with both hydrogen bonding sites and hydrophobic surfaces has been developed that traps aldehydes in bulk aqueous solution through the formation of hemiaminals. Dehydration of the hemiaminal to the imine is favored by the release of water from the hydrophobic microenvironment. Both the hemiaminals and imines could be detected by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry at room temperature.







Abstract
Stabilizing water&#8208;sensitive reaction intermediates is challenging but desirable for guiding reactions to desired products in water. Herein, we report that labile imine and hemiaminal functional groups can be stabilized inside a synthetic container compound, a water&#8208;soluble naphthotube. The naphthotube features a primary amine group anchored in a cavity with both hydrogen bonding sites and hydrophobic surfaces. Aldehydes in bulk aqueous solution are trapped in the cavity by the amine to form hemiaminals stabilized through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic effects. Dehydration of the hemiaminal to the imine is favored by the release of water from the hydrophobic microenvironment. Both the hemiaminals and imines can be detected at room temperature by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry.

         <title>Transparent and Colorless Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells Based on Pyrrolopyrrole Cyanine Sensitizers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transparent photovoltaics is a disruptive technology which widens the deployment of photovoltaics into new sectors such as for windows beyond the classical use of opaque panels. The great potential of pyrrolopyrrole cyanine dyes as NIR&#8208;sensitizers for the development of fully transparent and colorless dye sensitized solar cells is demonstrated.







Abstract
The development of transparent solar cells extends the applications of photovoltaics by offering the opportunity to substitute the gigantic surface coverage of windows by solar panels to produce electricity. Herein, we report a new family of NIR&#8208;sensitizers based on pyrrolopyrrole cyanine dyes, particularly efficient for the development of fully transparent and colorless dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells since a record efficiency of 2.5&#8201;% was achieved with an average visible transmittance (AVT) of 76&#8201;% and a color rending index (CRI) of 93.

         <title>A Copper Cage&#8208;Complex as Mimic of the pMMO CuC Site</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of copper complexes that replicate the CuC site of particulate methane monooxygenase is presented. Although this site is of great interest in the debate about the nature of the active site, it has not yet been modeled in a biomimetic study. The detailed replication leads to striking EPR similarities of the copper(II) state to purified pMMO. Further aerobic oxidation of hydroquinones as bioinspired substrates is shown.







Abstract
The active site of particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO) and its mechanism of action are not known. Recently, the CuC site emerged as a potential active site, but to date it lacks any study on biomimetic resemblance of the coordination environment provided by the enzyme. Here, the synthesis of a cage ligand providing such an environment is reported. Copper is incorporated, and coordination occurs by the two imidazole and one carboxylate group offered by the ligand. Depending on the oxidation state, it can adopt different coordination modes, as evidenced by the solid&#8208;state structures and computational investigation. The copper(I) state readily reacts with dioxygen and thereby undergoes CH activation. Moreover, the catalytic aerobic oxidation of hydroquinones as ubiquinol mimics is shown. Clean one&#8208;electron oxidation occurs under mild conditions and EPR analysis of the copper(II) state in the presence of water reveals striking similarities to the data obtained from pMMO.

Recently, the Cu&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; site emerged as a potential active site, but to date it lacks any study on biomimetic resemblance of the coordination environment provided by the enzyme. Here, the synthesis of a cage ligand providing such an environment is reported. Copper is incorporated, and coordination occurs by the two imidazole and one carboxylate group offered by the ligand. Depending on the oxidation state, it can adopt different coordination modes, as evidenced by the solid-state structures and computational investigation. The copper(I) state readily reacts with dioxygen and thereby undergoes CH activation. Moreover, the catalytic aerobic oxidation of hydroquinones as ubiquinol mimics is shown. Clean one-electron oxidation occurs under mild conditions and EPR analysis of the copper(II) state in the presence of water reveals striking similarities to the data obtained from pMMO.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes Encapsulated within Metallacycles</title>

Metallacycles embrace carbon nanotubes: The encapsulation of SWNTs within a Pd&#8208;based metallosquare featuring N&#8208;heterocyclic&#8208;carbene ligands is described. It is found that the formation of MINTs with this type of metallo&#8208;assembly is very sensitive to structural variations, but with the correct one it proceeds successfully both by &#8220;clipping&#8221; and &#8220;threading&#8221; strategies.







Abstract
Mechanically interlocked derivatives of carbon nanotubes (MINTs) are interesting nanotube products since they show high stability without altering the carbon nanotube structure. So far, MINTs have been synthesized using ring&#8208;closing metathesis, disulfide exchange reaction, H&#8208;bonding or direct threading with macrocycles. Here, we describe the encapsulation of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes within a palladium&#8208;based metallosquare. The formation of MINTs was confirmed by a variety of techniques, including high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy. We find the making of these MINTs is remarkably sensitive to structural variations of the metallo&#8208;assemblies. When a metallosquare with a cavity of appropriate shape and size is used, the formation of the MINT proceeds successfully by both templated clipping and direct threading. Our studies also show indications on how supramolecular coordination complexes can help expand the potential applications of MINTs.

Gold&#8208;furyl 1,3&#8208;dipoles generated in situ from &#945;&#8208;alkynylenones and gold catalysts were successfully used for borane&#8208;catalyzed amine C&#8722;H functionalization reactions, giving amine derivatives bearing a furan ring. The reactions took place either via an &#945;&#8208;furylation pathway or via a [3+2] cycloaddition pathway, depending on the alkyl groups attached to the amine.







Abstract
We designed a borane/gold(I) co&#8208;catalytic system and used it for C&#8722;H functionalization reactions and cycloaddition reactions between tertiary amines and &#945;&#8208;alkynylenones. Both reactions effectively incorporated a furan ring into the amine.

         <title>Asymmetric Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Hydroarylation&#8211;Nazarov Cyclization: Enantioselective Access to Cyclopentenones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new enantioselective version of the Nazarov cyclization is reported. The reaction design uses readily available alkenynones to trigger a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed anti&#8208;Michael hydroarylation of the ynone followed by Nazarov cyclization. A chiral gold complex is able to control the absolute stereochemistry of the process. Cyclopenta[c]chromenones, which combine the 2H&#8208;chromene and cylopentanone cores, are synthesized with high yields and ee values.







Abstract
The asymmetric synthesis of cyclopentachromenones from gold&#8208;catalyzed reaction of readily available skipped alkenynones is described. This cascade reaction involves an initial anti&#8208;Michael hydroarylation of the ynone moiety to form a gold&#8208;functionalized dialkenylketone intermediate, followed by a Nazarov cyclization that proceeds in an unprecedented enantioselective manner. Excellent enantiomeric ratios and chemical yields are obtained under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Stable High&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries Enabled by Strong Multiple Ion&#8211;Dipole Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermally stable electrolyte based on a stable solvation structure using multiple ion&#8211;dipole interactions was designed and developed. The strong coordination in the solvated structure of the electrolyte defines the lithium deposition behavior and the evolution of the solid electrolyte interphase at high temperature, which is important to achieve high Li&#8208;metal Coulombic efficiency and avoid Li dendritic growth.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) capable of operating stably at high temperature application scenarios are highly desirable. Conventional lithium&#8208;ion batteries could only work stably under 60&#8201;&#176;C because of the thermal instability of electrolyte at elevated temperature. Here we design and develop a thermal stable electrolyte based on stable solvation structure using multiple ion&#8211;dipole interactions. The strong coordination in solvated structure of electrolyte defines the Li deposition behaviour and the evolution of solid electrolyte interphase at high temperature, which is important to achieve high Li Coulombic efficiency and avoid Li dendritic growth. For high mass loading LiFePO4&#8208;Li cells, the cells at 60&#8201;&#176;C with conventional electrolyte easily run into failures, but the cells with our electrolyte at 90&#8201;&#176;C and 100&#8201;&#176;C could cycle more than 120 and 50&#8197;cycles respectively. This work provides new insight into electrolyte design and contributes to the development of high temperature LMBs.

         <title>Hexagonal Planar [B6H6] within a [B6H12] Borate Complex: Structure and Bonding of [(Cp*Ti)2(&#956;&#8208;&#627;6&#8201;:&#8201;&#627;6&#8208;B6H6)(&#956;&#8208;H)6]</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hexagonal borane [B6H6] ring supported by six B&#8722;H&#8722;Ti bonds in the coordination sphere of {Cp*Ti} fragments is formed from the reaction of [Cp*TiCl3] with [LiBH4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF] followed by thermolysis in presence of an excess of [BH3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF].







Abstract
Isolation of planar [B6H6] is a long&#8208;awaited goal in boron chemistry. Several attempts in the past to stabilize [B6H6] were unsuccessful due to the domination of polyhedral geometries. Herein, we report the synthesis of a triple&#8208;decker sandwich complex of titanium [(Cp*Ti)2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;6&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;6&#8208;B6H6)(&#956;&#8208;H)6] (1), which features the first&#8208;ever experimentally achieved nearly planar six&#8208;membered [B6H6] ring, albeit within a [B6H12] borate. The small deviation from planarity is a direct consequence of the predicted structural pattern of the middle ring in 24 Valence Electron Count (VEC) triple&#8208;decker complexes. The large ring size of [B6H6] in 1 brings the metal&#8211;metal distance into the bonding range. However, significant electron delocalization from the M&#8722;M bonding orbital to the bridging hydrogen and B&#8722;B skeleton in the middle decreases its bond strength.

&lt;p&gt;A hexagonal borane [B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] ring supported by six B&#8722;H&#8722;Ti bonds in the coordination sphere of {Cp*Ti} fragments is formed from the reaction of [Cp*TiCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] with [LiBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF] followed by thermolysis in presence of an excess of [BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF].
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isolation of planar [B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] is a long-awaited goal in boron chemistry. Several attempts in the past to stabilize [B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] were unsuccessful due to the domination of polyhedral geometries. Herein, we report the synthesis of a triple-decker sandwich complex of titanium [(Cp*Ti)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;-&#951;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)(&#956;-H)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), which features the first-ever experimentally achieved nearly planar six-membered [B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] ring, albeit within a [B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;] borate. The small deviation from planarity is a direct consequence of the predicted structural pattern of the middle ring in 24 Valence Electron Count (VEC) triple-decker complexes. The large ring size of [B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] in &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; brings the metal&#8211;metal distance into the bonding range. However, significant electron delocalization from the M&#8722;M bonding orbital to the bridging hydrogen and B&#8722;B skeleton in the middle decreases its bond strength.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Molecular &#8220;A&#8208;Type&#8221; Tangled Metallocube</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular &#8220;A&#8208;type&#8221; tangled metallocube has been generated by the reaction of a binuclear gold&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complex and H2S. The tangled cube topology with 8 [(&#956;3&#8208;S)Au3]+ units and 12 bis&#8208;NHC ligands was validated by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.







Abstract
Tangled cubes feature the topology of typical Platonic cubes, with their &#8220;faces&#8221; traversed by edges in different ways. This study generates an &#8220;A&#8208;type&#8221; tangled metallocube from the reaction of binuclear gold&#8208;NHC complex and H2S. The tangled cube topology was validated by multinuclear nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, high&#8208;resolution electrospray&#8208;ionization (HR&#8208;ESI) mass spectrometry, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. This study offers a simple and effective approach to designing and fabricating new, topologically unique molecular structures.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Gradient&#8208;Driven Sensitivity Enhancement of Liposome&#8208;Encapsulated Supramolecular Chemosensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Encapsulating supramolecular chemosensors inside liposomes and exposing them to a pH gradient across the lipid bilayer membrane increases the sensitivity by 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude. The utility of the approach was demonstrated by using various host&#8211;dye reporter pairs and sensing mechanisms, which showed increased sensitivity towards multiple biologically relevant analytes, including the neurotransmitters serotonin and tryptamine.







Abstract
An overarching challenge in the development of supramolecular sensor systems is to enhance their sensitivity, which commonly involves the synthesis of refined receptors with increased affinity to the analyte. We show that a dramatic sensitivity increase by 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude can be achieved by encapsulating supramolecular chemosensors inside liposomes and exposing them to a pH gradient across the lipid bilayer membrane. This causes an imbalance of the influx and efflux rates of basic and acidic analytes leading to a significantly increased concentration of the analyte in the liposome interior. The utility of our liposome&#8208;enhanced sensors was demonstrated with various host&#8211;dye reporter pairs and sensing mechanisms, and we could easily increase the sensitivity towards multiple biologically relevant analytes, including the neurotransmitters serotonin and tryptamine.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Benzylic Addition Reactions of Alkylarenes to Michael Acceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium catalyzed benzylic C(sp3)&#8722; C(sp3) bond formation with Michael acceptors was achieved. The catalyst is proposed to activate the aromatic ring via &#951;6&#8208;coordination, dramatically facilitating benzylic deprotonation and addition of the resulting carbanion to the electrophile in the absence of a base. This byproduct&#8208;free method features a wide scope of alkylarenes bearing primary, secondary, or tertiary benzylic C&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
The use of alkylarenes as nucleophile precursors in benzylic addition is challenging because the benzylic hydrogen atoms of these compounds are inert to deprotonation. Herein, we report Rh&#8208;catalyzed benzylic addition of alkylarenes to Michael acceptors for the formation of C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds. The catalyst is proposed to activate the aromatic ring via &#951;6&#8208;coordination, dramatically facilitating deprotonation of the unactivated benzylic C&#8722;H bond and addition of the resulting carbanion to the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated double bond in the absence of bases. Notably, this byproduct&#8208;free method provides an access to all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers through the development of ligands.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Semiconductor&#8208;Based Bio&#8208;Nano Hybrids for Sustainable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 Conversion with High Quantum Yield</title>

         <dc:description>
The efficient reduction of CO2 to CH4 by a designed bio&#8208;nano hybrid with high product selectivity and record quantum yield is reported. In this process, distinct capacitance and conductive effects promote electron storage and redistribution. This work sheds light on the development of sustainable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion to meet environmental and energy requirements.







Abstract
Bio&#8208;nano hybrids with methanogens and nano&#8208;semiconductors provide an innovative strategy for solar&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion; however, the efficiency mismatch between electron production and utilisation results in low quantum yield and CH4 selectivity. Herein, we report the integration of metal&#8208;free polymeric carbon nitrides (CNx) decorated with cyanamide (NCN) groups and Methanosarcina barkeri (M. b). The self&#8208;assembled M. b&#8208;NCNCNx exhibited a quantum yield of 50.3&#8201;% with 92.3&#8201;% CH4 selectivity under illumination, which outperforms other reported bio&#8208;nano hybrid systems and photocatalytic systems for CO2 reduction. This excellent performance was attributed to the distinct capacitance and conductive effects of NCNCNx, which promoted electron storage and redistribution at the biotic&#8211;abiotic interface to alleviate recombination losses and side reaction. This study provides new design guidelines for bio&#8208;nano hybrids for the sustainable photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into fuels.

         <title>Nearly Unity Quantum Yield Persistent Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Heavy Atom&#8208;Free Rigid Inorganic/Organic Hybrid Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of heavy atom&#8208;free inorganic/organic hybrid composites are prepared by a simple and green solid&#8208;phase method. Through the synergism of covalent and non&#8208;covalent bonds, the organic guest phosphors can be completely fixed in the inorganic matrix, just like in the low&#8208;temperature glass state, thus exhibiting highly efficient and persistent room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence with quantum yields up to 100&#8201;% and average lifetimes up to 8.74&#8197;s.







Abstract
Synergism between covalent and non&#8208;covalent bonds is employed to fix an organic phosphor guest in a rigid inorganic framework, simulating the stiffening effect seen in the glassy state and realizing efficient and ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP). Twelve heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free composites have been obtained through introducing arylboric or arylcarboxylic acid derivatives into the inorganic boric acid matrix by solid&#8208;phase synthesis. Owing to the stiffening effect of multiple bonds, all the composites show highly efficient and persistent RTP of guest molecules with a quantum yield ranging from 39.8&#8201;% to ca. 100&#8201;% and a lifetime up to 8.74&#8197;s, which results in a 55&#8197;s afterglow visible to the naked eye after exposure to a portable UV lamp. Interestingly, it is found that the substitution position and quantity of carboxyl in the guest have a great influence on the phosphorescent properties, and that the heavy&#8208;atom effect is invalid in such host&#8211;guest hybrid systems. The 100&#8197;g grade composite is easily prepared because of the solvent&#8208;free, green, and simple synthesis method. These results provide an important way for the development of RTP materials with ultrahigh quantum yield and ultralong lifetime, as well as their practical applications in the fields of anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information storage, among others.

         <title>Structures of the Most Twisted Thioamide and Selenoamide: Effect of Higher Chalcogens of Twisted Amides on N&#8722;C(X) Resonance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first higher chalcogen derivatives of non&#8208;planar twisted amides are reported. The study provides the first experimental evidence on the effect of chalcogen isologues on the structural and electronic properties of the non&#8208;planar amide N&#8722;C(X) linkage with implications in broad areas of chemistry that utilize amide bonds through the modification of nN&#8594;&#960;*C=O resonance and amide bond geometry.







Abstract
Amide bond replacement with planar isosteric chalcogen analogues has an important implication for the properties of the N&#8722;C(X) linkage in structural chemistry, biochemistry and organic synthesis. Herein, we report the first higher chalcogen derivatives of non&#8208;planar twisted amides. The synthesis of twisted thioamide in a versatile system has been accomplished by direct thionation without cleavage of the &#963; N&#8722;C bond. The synthesis of twisted selenoamide has been accomplished by selenation with Woollins&#8217; reagent. The structures of higher chalcogen analogues of non&#8208;planar amides were unambiguously confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Reactivity studies were conducted to determine the effect of isologous N&#8722;C(O) to N&#8722;C(X) replacement on the properties of the amide linkage. Computational studies were employed to evaluate structural and energetic parameters of amide bond alteration in higher chalcogen amides. The study provides the first experimental evidence on the effect of chalcogen isologues on the structural and electronic properties of the non&#8208;planar amide N&#8722;C(X) linkage.

         <title>Role&#8208;Specialized Division of Labor in CO2 Reduction with Doubly&#8208;Functionalized Iron Porphyrin Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Fe porphyrin decorated with two cationic units in a cis&#8208;arrangement was synthesized and showed exceptionally high activity for the electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. Theoretical studies revealed that the two cationic units function differently but cooperatively to promote the C&#8722;O bond cleavage. This work presents a significant example of synthetic catalysts, which use a role&#8208;specialized division of labor strategy in small&#8208;molecule activation.







Abstract
In enzymes, the active site residues function differently to promote chemical reactions. Such a role&#8208;specialized division of labor has been rarely realized by synthetic catalysts. We report herein on catalytic CO2 reduction with Fe porphyrins decorated with two cationic N,N,N&#8208;trimethylbenzylamine groups in cis&#8208; or trans&#8208;arrangement. The cis&#8208;isomer outperforms the trans&#8208;isomer and reaches a TOFmax of 4.4&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1 in acetonitrile using phenol proton source. Theoretical studies revealed that the two cationic units in the cis&#8208;isomer are more effective than a single cationic unit to improve the CO2 binding, and more importantly, they function differently but cooperatively to promote the C&#8722;O bond cleavage: one interacts with the CO2&#8208;adduct, while the other one interacts with the phenol molecule through electrostatic interactions. This work therefore presents a significant example of synthetic catalysts, which boost chemical reactions using a role&#8208;specialized strategy for substrate activation.

         <title>Direct Enantioselective Addition of Alkynes to Imines by a Highly Efficient Palladacycle Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferrocenyl palladacycle complex has been identified as a highly enantioselective catalyst for 1,2&#8208;additions of a diverse range of alkynes to imines (39 examples) providing nearly enantiopure propargylic amine derivatives. Compared to known methods turnover numbers could be increased by ca. 2&#8211;3 orders of magnitude.







Abstract
Enantiopure propargylic amines are highly valuable synthetic building blocks. Much effort has been devoted to develop methods for their preparation. The arguably most important strategy is the 1,2&#8208;addition of alkynes to imines. Despite remarkable progress, the known methods using Zn and Cu catalysts suffer from the need for high catalyst loadings, typically ranging from 2&#8211;60&#8197;mol&#8201;% for neutral aldimine substrates. Here we report a planar chiral Pd complex acting as very efficient catalyst for direct asymmetric alkyne additions to imines, requiring very low catalyst loadings. Turnover numbers of up to 8700 were accomplished. Our investigation suggests that a Pd&#8208;acetylide complex is generated as a catalytically relevant intermediate by the aid of an acac ligand acting as internal catalytic base. It is shown that the catalyst is quite stable under the reaction conditions and that product inhibition is not an issue. A total of 39 examples is shown which all yielded almost enantiopure products.

         <title>Alcohols as Alkylating Agents: Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Conjugate Alkylation via In Situ Deoxygenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alcohols are among the most commercially accessible alkyl fragments, yet their direct use in C(sp3)&#8208;based fragment couplings remains underdeveloped. In this report, a mild strategy for the in situ activation of alcohols by benzoxazolium salts is applied to deoxygenative conjugate alkylation for a broad range of alcohol and Michael acceptor substrates, including structurally diverse drugs, natural products, and biomolecules.







Abstract
The rapid exploration of sp3&#8208;enriched chemical space is facilitated by fragment&#8208;coupling technologies that utilize simple and abundant alkyl precursors, among which alcohols are a highly desirable, commercially accessible, and synthetically versatile class of substrate. Herein, we describe an operationally convenient, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;mediated deoxygenative Giese&#8208;type addition of alcohol&#8208;derived alkyl radicals to electron&#8208;deficient alkenes under mild photocatalytic conditions. The fragment coupling accommodates a broad range of primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohol partners, as well as structurally varied Michael acceptors containing traditionally reactive sites, such as electrophilic or oxidizable moieties. We demonstrate the late&#8208;stage diversification of densely functionalized molecular architectures, including drugs and biomolecules, and we further telescope our protocol with metallaphotoredox cross&#8208;coupling for step&#8208;economic access to sp3&#8208;rich complexity.

     alt="Alcohols as Alkylating Agents: Photoredox-Catalyzed Conjugate Alkylation via In Situ Deoxygenation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcohols are among the most commercially accessible alkyl fragments, yet their direct use in C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)-based fragment couplings remains underdeveloped. In this report, a mild strategy for the in situ activation of alcohols by benzoxazolium salts is applied to deoxygenative conjugate alkylation for a broad range of alcohol and Michael acceptor substrates, including structurally diverse drugs, natural products, and biomolecules.
&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;i&gt;3&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;-enriched chemical space is facilitated by fragment-coupling technologies that utilize simple and abundant alkyl precursors, among which alcohols are a highly desirable, commercially accessible, and synthetically versatile class of substrate. Herein, we describe an operationally convenient, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-mediated deoxygenative Giese-type addition of alcohol-derived alkyl radicals to electron-deficient alkenes under mild photocatalytic conditions.

         <title>Diastereodivergent Synthesis of Cyclopentyl Boronic Esters Bearing Contiguous Fully Substituted Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 35, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrophile&#8208;induced ring contractive 1,2&#8208;metallate rearrangement of 6&#8208;membered cyclic alkenyl boronate complexes enables the synthesis of cyclopentyl boronic esters bearing two contiguous, fully substituted stereocenters with excellent levels of enantio&#8208; and diastereocontrol. The utility of our methodology is demonstrated in the asymmetric total synthesis of (+)&#8208;herbertene&#8208;1,14&#8208;diol.







Abstract
The synthesis of molecules bearing two or more contiguous, quaternary stereocenters is challenging, owing to the difficulty in controlling stereochemistry whilst simultaneously constructing a sterically congested motif. Herein, we report the electrophile&#8208;induced ring contractive 1,2&#8208;metallate rearrangement of 6&#8208;membered cyclic alkenyl boronate complexes for the synthesis of cyclopentyl boronic esters bearing two contiguous, fully substituted stereocenters with high levels of stereocontrol. Remarkably, simple variation of the reaction solvent enabled their diastereodivergent construction with facile access to complementary diastereomeric pairs. The utility of our methodology is demonstrated in the asymmetric total synthesis of (+)&#8208;herbertene&#8208;1,14&#8208;diol.
