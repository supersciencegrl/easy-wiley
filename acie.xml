         <title>An Improved Turn Structure for Inducing &#946;&#8208;Hairpin Formation in Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although &#946;&#8208;hairpins are widespread in proteins, there is still no universal tool to coax any small peptide to adopt a &#946;&#8208;hairpin conformation, regardless of sequence. Here, we report that &#948;&#8208;linked &#947;(  R  )&#8208;methyl&#8208;ornithine (  &#948;  MeOrn) provides an improved &#946;&#8208;turn template for inducing a &#946;&#8208;hairpin conformation in peptides. We have developed a synthesis of protected  &#948;  MeOrn as a building block suitable for use in Fmoc&#8208;based solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. The synthesis begins with  l  &#8208;leucine and affords gram quantities of the  N  &#945;  &#8208;Boc&#8208;  N  &#948;  &#8208;Fmoc&#8208;&#947;(  R  )&#8208;methyl&#8208;ornithine building block. X&#8208;ray crystallography confirms that the  &#948;  MeOrn turn unit adopts a folded structure in a macrocyclic &#946;&#8208;hairpin peptide. CD and NMR spectroscopic experiments allow comparison of the  &#948;  MeOrn turn template to the &#948;&#8208;linked ornithine (  &#948;  Orn) turn template that our laboratory has previously introduced and also to the popular  d  &#8208;Pro&#8208;Gly turn template. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that the folding of the  &#948;  MeOrn turn template is substantially better than that of  &#948;  Orn and is comparable to  d  &#8208;Pro&#8208;Gly.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust and Versatile Coatings Engineered via Simultaneous Covalent and Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interfacial modular assembly has emerged as an adaptable strategy for engineering the surface properties of substrates in biomedicine, photonics, and catalysis. Herein, we report a versatile and robust coating (pBDT&#8211;TA), self&#8208;assembled from tannic acid (TA) and a self&#8208;polymerizing aromatic dithiol (i.e., benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiol, BDT), that can be engineered on diverse substrates with a precisely tuned thickness (5&#8211;40 nm) by varying the concentration of BDT used. The pBDT&#8211;TA coating is stabilized by covalent (disulfide) bonds and supramolecular (&#960;&#8211;&#960;) interactions, endowing the coating with high stability in various harsh aqueous environments across ionic strength, pH, temperature (e.g., 100 mM NaCl, HCl (pH 1) or NaOH (pH&#160;13), and water at 100 &#176;C), as well as surfactant solution (e.g., 100 mM Triton X&#8208;100) and biological buffer (e.g., Dulbecco&#8217;s phosphate&#8208;buffered saline), as validated by experiments and simulations. Moreover, the reported pBDT&#8211;TA coating enables secondary reactions on the coating for engineering hybrid adlayers (e.g., ZIF&#8208;8 shells) via phenolic&#8208;mediated adhesion, and the facile integration of aromatic fluorescent dyes (e.g., rhodamine B) via &#960; interactions without requiring elaborate synthetic processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultralow Volume Change of P2&#8208;type Layered Oxide Cathode with Controlled Phase Transition by Regulating Distribution of Na+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most P2&#8208;type layered oxides exhibit a large volume change when they are charged into high voltage, and it further lead to bad structural stability. In fact, high voltage is not the reason which causes the irreversible phase transition. There are two internal factors which affect structural evolution: the amount and distribution of Na ions retained in the lattice. Hereon, a series of layered oxides Na  2/3  Mn  x  Ni  x&#8208;1/3  Co  4/3&#8208;2x  O  2  (1/3 &#8804; x &#8804; 2/3) were synthesized. It is observed that different components have different structural evolutions during the charge/discharge processes, and further researches find that the distribution of Na ions in layers is the main factor. By controlling the distribution of Na ions, the phase transition process can be well controlled. As the referential component, P2&#8208;Na  2/3  Mn  1/2  Ni  1/6  Co  1/3  O  2  cathode with uniform distribution of Na ions is cycled at the voltage window of 1.5&#8208;4.5 V, which exhibits a volume change as low as 1.9%. Such a low strain is benefical for cycling stability. The current work provides a new and effective route to regulate the structural evolution of the promising P2&#8208;type layered cathode for sodium ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Charge Separation Prompted Intervalence Charge Transfer in a Bis(thienyl)diketopyrrolopyrrole Bridged Donor&#8208;TCBD Push&#8208;Pull System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intervalence charge transfer (IVCT), a phenomenon observed in molecular systems comprised of two redox centers differing in oxidation states by one unit, is reported in a novel, newly synthesized, multi&#8208;modular donor&#8208;acceptor system comprised of central bis(thienyl)diketopyrrolopyrrole (TDPP) hosting two phenothiazine&#8208;tetracyanobutadiene (PTZ&#8208;TCBD) entities on the opposite sides.&#160; One&#8208;electron reduction of TCBD promoted electron exchange between the two TCBD resulting in IVCT transition in the near&#8208;infrared region.&#160;   The stabilization energy, &#8208;   D   G  com  and comproportionation equilibrium constant, K  com  calculated from peak potentials of the split reduction waves were found to be 1.06 x 10  4  J/mol, and 72.3 M  &#8208;1  , respectively.&#160; Further, the IVCT transition was also witnessed during the process of thermodynamically feasible electron transfer upon excitation of the TDPP entity in the system, and served as a diagnostic marker to characterize the electron transfer product. Subsequent transient absorption spectral studies and data analysis by Global and Target analyses revealed occurrence of ultrafast charge separation (k  cs  ~ 10  10  s  &#8208;1  ) owing to the close proximity and good communication between the entities of the multi&#8208;modular donor&#8208;acceptor system.&#160; The role of central TDPP in promoting IVCT is borne out from the present investigation.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Radical Hydro&#8208; and Aminooxygenation of Unactivated Alkenes Tuned by Ketoxime Carbonates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reported here is a tunable photocatalytic protocol for anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydro&#8208; and aminooxygenation of unactivated alkenes by using readily accessible ketoxime carbonates as the diverse functionalization reagents. Mechanism studies reveal that this reaction is initiated through an energy transfer promoted N&#8208;O bond homolysis of ketoxime carbonates leading to alkoxylcarbonyloxyl and iminyl radicals under visible light photocatalysis, followed by the addition of alkoxylcarbonyloxyl radical to alkenes. By taking advantage of the different stability of iminyl radicals, the generated carbon radical either abstracts a hydrogen atom from the media to form the anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydrooxygenation product or trapped by the persistent iminyl radical to furnish the aminooxygenation product. Notably, this is the first example of direct hydrooxygenation of unactivated olefins with anti&#8208;Markovnikov regioselectivity involving an oxygen&#8208;centred radical.</dc:description>

The cyclic voltammometric studies on these complexes show two reversible reduction waves, associated to two successive one&#8208;electron reductions of the NDI core of the ligand. The comparison of the infrared spectra of the complexes [IrCl(NDI&#8208;NHC)(CO)  2  ] and their related one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron reduced forms, reveal that each one&#8208;electron reduction produces a decrease of the average n(CO) of 9&#8208;10 cm  &#8208;1  , indicating a significant enhancement of the electronrichness of the metal. The [MCl(NDI&#8208;NHC)(COD)] complexes were tested in the catalytic cycloisomerization of alkynoic acids. While the neutral catalysts showed little activity in these reactions, the one&#8208;electron reduced forms showed greatly enhanced activities. For the cyclization of 5&#8208;hexynoic acid, the two&#8208;electron reduction of the ligand produced further enhancement of the catalytic activity, therefore showing that the catalyst can switch between three redox species with three distinct catalytic activities.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular assembly of conjugated polymers under vibrational strong coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strong coupling plays a significant role in influencing chemical reactions and tuning material properties by modifying the energy landscapes of the systems. Here we study the effect of vibrational strong coupling (VSC) on supramolecular organization. For this purpose, a rigid&#8208;rod conjugated polymer known to form gels was strongly coupled together with its solvent in a microfluidic IR Fabry&#8208;Perot cavity. Absorption and fluorescence studies indicate a large modification of the self&#8208;assembly under such cooperative VSC. Electron microscopy confirms that in this case, the supramolecular morphology is totally different from that observed in the absence of strong coupling. In addition, the self&#8208;assembly kinetics are altered and depend on the solvent vibration under VSC. The results are compared to kinetic isotope effects on the self&#8208;assembly to help clarify the role of different parameters under strong coupling. These findings indicate that VSC is a valuable new tool for controlling supramolecular assemblies with broad implications for the molecular and material sciences.</dc:description>

         <title>Unambiguous Tracking of Protein Phosphorylation by Fast High&#8208;Resolution FOSY NMR**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new suite of 2D FOSY experiments focuses on one coupled nuclear spin system at a time, that is, a PTM site or a structural hotspot in general, with 3&#8211;5 known frequencies. With higher sensitivity and versatility than achievable by traditional experiments, FOSY solves the spectral dispersion problem and obtains only the relevant local NMR signal assignment in a few hours, as demonstrated for two phosphorylation sites in the 441&#8208;residue IDP Tau.







Abstract
Dysregulation of post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) like phosphorylation is often involved in disease. NMR may elucidate exact loci and time courses of PTMs at atomic resolution and near&#8208;physiological conditions but requires signal assignment to individual atoms. Conventional NMR methods for this base on tedious global signal assignment that may often fail, as for large intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). We present a sensitive, robust alternative to rapidly obtain only the local assignment near affected signals, based on FOcused SpectroscopY (FOSY) experiments using selective polarisation transfer (SPT). We prove its efficiency by identifying two phosphorylation sites of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3&#946;) in human Tau40, an IDP of 441 residues, where the extreme spectral dispersion in FOSY revealed unprimed phosphorylation also of Ser409. FOSY may broadly benefit NMR studies of PTMs and other hotspots in IDPs, including sites involved in molecular interactions.

         <title>Epitaxial Nickel Ferrocyanide Stabilizes Jahn&#8211;Teller Distortions of Manganese Ferrocyanide for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Mn&#8208;based Prussian Blue analogue prone to destabilizing Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions upon oxidation is coated with an epitaxial layer of Ni&#8208;based Prussian Blue. This outer layer exerts an anisotropic strain on the lattice of the inner layer, largely preventing structural degradation during Na+ extraction and re&#8208;insertion. As a sodium&#8208;ion battery cathode, the material combines the high capacity and high stability of its two components.







Abstract
Manganese&#8208;based Prussian Blue, Na2&#8722;&#948;Mn[Fe(CN)6] (MnPB), is a good candidate for sodium&#8208;ion battery cathode materials due to its high capacity. However, it suffers from severe capacity decay during battery cycling due to the destabilizing Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions it undergoes as Mn2+ is oxidized to Mn3+. Herein, the structure is stabilized by a thin epitaxial surface layer of nickel&#8208;based Prussian Blue (Na2&#8722;&#948;Ni[Fe(CN)6]). The one&#8208;pot synthesis relies on a chelating agent with an unequal affinity for Mn2+ and Ni2+ ions, which prevents Ni2+ from reacting until the Mn2+ is consumed. This is a new and simpler synthesis of core&#8211;shell materials, which usually needs several steps. The material has an electrochemical capacity of 93&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1, of which it retains 96&#8201;% after 500 charge&#8211;discharge cycles (vs. 37&#8201;% for MnPB). Its rate capability is also remarkable: at 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 (ca. 55&#8197;C) it can reversibly store 70&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is also reflected in its diffusion coefficient of ca. 10&#8722;8&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1. The epitaxial outer layer appears to exert an anisotropic strain on the inner layer, preventing the Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions it normally undergoes during de&#8208;sodiation.

         <title>Heteroleptic Ligation by an endo&#8208;Functionalized Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cage compound is synthesized that is endo&#8208;functionalized with one carboxylic acid and two imidazole moieties. These groups can cooperate with each other to coordinate to Zn(II) and Fe(II) resulting in biomimetic quasi&#8208;heteroleptic transition&#8208;metal&#8208;cage complexes. Coordination of &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate to the iron complex leads to an increase of its reactivity towards dioxygen.







Abstract
A conceptual approach for the synthesis of quasi&#8208;heteroleptic complexes with properly endo&#8208;functionalized cages as ligands is presented. The cage ligand reported here is of a covalent organic nature, it has been synthesized via a dynamic combinatorial chemistry approach, making use of a masked amine.

&lt;p&gt;A cage compound is synthesized that is &lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt;-functionalized with one carboxylic acid and two imidazole moieties. These groups can cooperate with each other to coordinate to Zn(II) and Fe(II) resulting in biomimetic quasi-heteroleptic transition-metal-cage complexes. Coordination of &#945;-ketoglutarate to the iron complex leads to an increase of its reactivity towards dioxygen.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A conceptual approach for the synthesis of quasi-heteroleptic complexes with properly endo-functionalized cages as ligands is presented. The cage ligand reported here is of a covalent organic nature, it has been synthesized via a dynamic combinatorial chemistry approach, making use of a masked amine. Inspired by enzymatic active sites, the described system bears one carboxylate and two imidazole moieties as independent ligating units through which it is able to coordinate to transition metals. Analysis of the iron(II) complex in solution and the solid state validates the structure and shows that no undesired but commonly observed dimerization process takes place. The solid-state structure shows a five-coordinate metal center with the carboxylate bidentately bound to iron, which makes &lt;b&gt;Fe@2&lt;/b&gt; an unprecedentedly detailed structural model complex for this kind of non-heme iron oxygenases. As, as confirmed by the crystal structure, sufficient space for other organic ligands is available, the biologically relevant ligand &#945;-ketoglutarate is implemented. We observe biomimetic reaction behavior towards dioxygen that opens studies investigating &lt;b&gt;Fe@2&lt;/b&gt; as a functional model complex.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Remote Site&#8208;Selective Radical C(sp3)&#8722;H Monodeuteration of Amides using D2O</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

Radical C&#8722;H Deuteration: A environmentally benign metal&#8208;free method for remote radical C&#8722;H deuteration at various unactivated sp3&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds including primary C&#8722;H bonds next to heteroatoms for the &#948;&#8208;deuteration of primary amines, &#947;&#8208;deuteration of aliphatic acids and &#945;&#8208;deuteration of secondary amines has been developed.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective incorporation of deuterium into biologically active compounds is of high interest in pharmaceutical industry. We present a mild and environmentally benign metal&#8208;free method for the remote selective radical C&#8722;H monodeuteration of aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds in various amides with inexpensive heavy water (D2O) as the deuterium source. The method uses the easily installed N&#8208;allylsulfonyl moiety as an N&#8208;radical precursor that generates the remote C&#8208;radical via site&#8208;selective 1,5&#8208; or 1,6&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). Methyl thioglycolate, that readily exchanges its proton with D2O, serves as the radical deuteration reagent and as a chain&#8208;carrier. The highly site&#8208;selective monodeuteration has been applied to different types of unactivated sp3&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds and also to the deuteration of C&#8722;H bonds next to heteroatoms. The potential utility of this method is further demonstrated by the site&#8208;selective incorporation of deuterium into natural product derivatives and drugs.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Nanoparticle&#8208;Loaded Hollow Carbon Spheres as Nanoreactors for Hydrogenation of Levulinic Acid: Explicitly Recognizing the Void&#8208;Confinement Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The void&#8208;confinement effect of metal&#8208;loaded hollow carbon spheres as synthetic nanoreactors is explicitly recognized as an integrating effect involving electronic metal&#8211;support interactions, reactant enrichment, and diffusion. These findings provide insights for comprehending microenvironment effects of hollow carbon nanostructures in biomass hydrogenation applications.







Abstract
As a typical class of man&#8208;made nanoreactors, metal&#8208;loaded hollow carbon nanostructures (MHC nanoreactors) exhibit competitive potentials in the heterogeneous catalysis due to their tailorable microenvironment effects, in which the void&#8208;confinement effect is one of the most fundamental functions in boosting the catalytic performance. Herein this paper, Ru&#8208;loaded hollow carbon spheres are employed as nanoreactors with a crucial biomass hydrogenation process, levulinic acid (LA) hydrogenation into &#947;&#8208;valerolactone, as the probe reaction to further recognize the forming mechanism of this pivotal effect. We demonstrated that the void&#8208;confinement effect of the selected MHC nanoreactors is essentially driven by an integrating action of electronic metal&#8208;support interaction, reactant enrichment and diffusion, which are mainly ascribed to peculiar properties of hollow nanoreactors both in electronic and structural aspects, respectively. This work offers a distinct case for interpreting the catalytic behaviour of MHC nanoreactors, which could potentially promise broader insights into the microenvironment engineering strategies of hollow nanostructures.

         <title>Double Ionic&#8211;Electronic Transfer Interface Layers for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The double ionic&#8211;electronic transfer interface layers between electrode and electrolyte were created by in&#8197;situ polymerization of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophene inside the solid&#8208;state lithium battery, resulting in low interface resistance and highly stable interface contact.







Abstract
Large&#8208;scale implementation of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries is impeded by the physical limitations of the interface between the electrode and solid electrolyte; specifically, high resistance and poor stability, as well as poor compatibility with Li+ migration. We report double ionic&#8211;electronic transfer interface layers grown at electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces by in&#8197;situ polymerization of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophene in polyethylene oxide (PEO) electrolyte. For all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LiFePO4&#8741;PT&#8208;PEO&#8208;PT&#8741;Li cells, the formation of a conductive polythiophene (PT) layer at the cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface resulted in an at least sevenfold decrease in interface resistance, and realized a capacity retention of about 94&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;cycles along with a lower polarization voltage under a rate of 2&#8197;C. The mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductive layers imparted superior interface stability and contact while keeping good compatibility with the Li anode.

         <title>Selective 13C&#8208;Labels on Repeating Glycan Oligomers to Reveal Protein Binding Epitopes through NMR: Polylactosamine Binding to Galectins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Repeating carbohydrate patterns are commonly found in Nature in extended oligosaccharides and polysaccharides. When recognized by protein receptors, dissecting the contribution of each repeating unit to the binding event is not easy. Here, the introduction of 13C&#8208;labels at specific positions of a tri&#8208;LacNAc repeating hexasaccharide has been used in STD&#8208;HSQC&#8197;NMR experiments to reveal the preferred binding epitopes for a panel of human galectins.







Abstract
A combined chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis/NMR&#8208;based methodology is presented to identify, in unambiguous manner, the distinctive binding epitope within repeating sugar oligomers when binding to protein receptors. The concept is based on the incorporation of 13C&#8208;labels at specific monosaccharide units, selected within a repeating glycan oligomeric structure. No new chemical tags are added, and thus the chemical entity remains the same, while the presence of the 13C&#8208;labeled monosaccharide breaks the NMR chemical shift degeneracy that occurs in the non&#8208;labeled compound and allows the unique identification of the different components of the oligomer. The approach is demonstrated by a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study dealing with the interaction of a polylactosamine hexasaccharide with five different galectins that display distinct preferences for these entities.

         <title>Dinuclear Silver Complexes in Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The field of silver catalysis has seen tremendous growth over the past two decades, and dinuclear complexes are often proposed to facilitate silver&#8208;catalyzed transformations. In this Minireview, we survey and analyze the various roles of dinuclear silver complexes in homogeneous catalysis. We also highlight outstanding questions as well as areas for potential growth and development.







Abstract
Over the past two decades, there has been a substantial increase in the number of synthetically useful transformations catalyzed by silver. Across the range of silver&#8208;catalyzed reactions that have been reported, dinuclear species often emerge as a common feature, either as the (pre&#8208;)catalysts themselves or as intermediates during catalysis. This Minireview explores the role of dinuclear silver complexes in homogeneous catalysis, which we hope will aid in the development of improved design principles for silver catalysts.

In this Minireview, we survey and analyze the various roles of dinuclear silver complexes in homogeneous catalysis. We also highlight outstanding questions as well as areas for potential growth and development.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past two decades, there has been a substantial increase in the number of synthetically useful transformations catalyzed by silver. Across the range of silver-catalyzed reactions that have been reported, dinuclear species often emerge as a common feature, either as the (pre-)catalysts themselves or as intermediates during catalysis. This Minireview explores the role of dinuclear silver complexes in homogeneous catalysis, which we hope will aid in the development of improved design principles for silver catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synthesis of Rhodium Complexes with Chiral Diene Ligands via Diastereoselective Coordination and Their Application in the Asymmetric Insertion of Diazo Compounds into E&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rhodium complexes with bulky racemic dienes were synthesized and separated into pure enantiomers by diastereoselective coordination with a chiral auxiliary ligand. The optimal structure of the auxiliary ligand and the selectivity of coordination were predicted by density functional theory calculations. The resulting chiral complexes catalyze the asymmetric insertion of diazoesters into B&#8722;H and Si&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
A new method for the synthesis of chiral diene rhodium catalysts is introduced. The readily available racemic tetrafluorobenzobarrelene complexes [(R2&#8208;TFB)RhCl]2 were separated into two enantiomers via selective coordination of one of them with the auxiliary S&#8208;salicyl&#8208;oxazoline ligand. One of the resulting chiral complexes with an exceptionally bulky diene ligand [(R,R&#8208;iPr2&#8208;TFB)RhCl]2 was an efficient catalyst for the asymmetric insertion of diazoesters into B&#8722;H and Si&#8722;H bonds giving the functionalized organoboranes and silanes with high yields (79&#8211;97&#8201;%) and enantiomeric purity (87&#8211;98&#8201;% ee). The stereoselectivity of separation via auxiliary ligand and that of the catalytic reaction was predicted by DFT calculations.

         <title>Dissecting the Flash Chemistry of Electrogenerated Reactive Intermediates by Microdroplet Fusion Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microreactor on the fly: A special microreactor that permits mass spectrometric probing the flash chemistry of electrogenerated reactive intermediates was demonstrated based on collision mixing of electrosprayed microdroplets, which employed a theta&#8208;glass capillary integrated with carbon bipolar electrodes to produce short&#8208;lived intermediates in situ.







Abstract
A novel mass spectrometric method for probing the flash chemistry of electrogenerated reactive intermediates was developed based on rapid collision mixing of electrosprayed microdroplets by using a theta&#8208;glass capillary. The two individual microchannels of the theta&#8208;glass capillary are asymmetrically or symmetrically fabricated with a carbon bipolar electrode to produce intermediates in situ. Microdroplets containing the newly formed intermediates collide with those of the invoked reactants at sub&#8208;10 microsecond level, making it a powerful tool for exploring their ultrafast initial transformations. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we present the identification of the key radical cation intermediate in the oxidative dimerization of 8&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoline and also the first disclosure of previously hidden nitrenium ion involved reaction pathway in the C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling between N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethylaniline and phenothiazine.

         <title>Efficient Asymmetric Biomimetic Aldol Reaction of Glycinates and Trifluoromethyl Ketones by Carbonyl Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient biomimetic aldol reaction of glycinate and trifluoromethyl ketones was developed with 0.1&#8211;0.0033&#8197;mol&#8201;% of chiral pyridoxal 7&#8201;a as the catalyst, producing &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;acid esters 6 in 55&#8211;82&#8201;% yields with excellent distereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;20:1 dr and 99&#8201;% ee) without protection of the active NH2 group. The reaction proceeds via a bifunctional&#8208;catalysis pathway similar to the enzymatic aldol reaction of glycine.







Abstract
The direct asymmetric aldol reaction of glycinates represents an intriguing and straightforward strategy to make biologically significant chiral &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;acid derivatives. But it is not easy to realize the transformation due to the disruption of the reactive NH2 group of glycinates. Inspired by the enzymatic aldol reaction of glycine, we successfully developed an asymmetric aldol reaction of glycinate 5 and trifluoromethyl ketones 4 with 0.1&#8211;0.0033&#8197;mol&#8201;% of chiral N&#8208;methyl pyridoxal 7&#8201;a as the catalyst, producing chiral &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;acid esters 6 in 55&#8211;82&#8201;% yields (for the syn&#8208;diastereomers) with up to &gt;20:1 dr and 99&#8201;% ee under very mild conditions. The reaction proceeds via a catalytic cycle similar to the enzymatic aldol reaction of glycine. Pyridoxal catalyst 7&#8201;a activates both reactants at the same time and brings them together in a specific spatial orientation, accounting for the high efficiency as well as excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities.

         <title>A Primary Acyl Phosphine Stabilized by a Phosphonium Ylide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of Ph3GePCO with the ylide Ph3PCH2 and subsequent reactions are used to access Ph3PCHC(O)P(GePh3)2 and Ph3PCHC(O)PH2. The zwitterionic nature of these species illustrates this new strategy to stabilization of acylphosphines. Indeed the latter species is a rare example of an air stable primary acyl&#8208;phosphines, devoid of a stabilizing heteroatom adjacent to the carbonyl fragment.







Abstract
Primary acyl&#8208;phosphines are scarce in the literature. Here we show that the reaction of Ph3GePCO with the ylide Ph3PCH2 proceeds to give the species Ph3PCHC(O)PH(GePh3) 1. Deprotonation of 1 with Na[N(SiMe3)2] generates the salt [Na(THF)2][Ph3PCHC(O)P(GePh3)] 2 which provides subsequent access to the bis&#8208;germanylated acylphosphine, Ph3PCHC(O)P(GePh3)2 3. Alternatively, treatment of 1 with HCl in dioxane affords the primary acylphosphine Ph3PCHC(O)PH2 4. Compound 4 is a rare example of an air stable primary acyl&#8208;phosphines and the first devoid of a stabilizing heteroatom adjacent to the carbonyl fragment.

         <title>Alkene Isomerization Revitalizes the Coates&#8211;Claisen Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategic use of alkene isomerization has enabled the first systematic study of the [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of allylic vinyl acetals, first discovered by Coates nearly forty years ago and rarely applied since.

The [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of allylic vinyl acetals, first investigated by Coates nearly four decades ago, is set apart from other variants of the Claisen rearrangement owing to the versatile monoprotected 1,5&#8208;dicarbonyl motif featured in the products. Unfortunately, the synthetically elusive nature of the substrates has thus far precluded the widespread application of this attractive transformation. Herein, we show that the key allylic vinyl acetals can be efficiently generated through alkene isomerization of their readily available regioisomeric counterparts (derived from allylic alcohols and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes), thus enabling the first systematic study of the substrate scope of this rearrangement, as well as the discovery of exceptionally mild conditions for its mediation by Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acids.

&lt;p&gt;The strategic use of alkene isomerization has enabled the first systematic study of the [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of allylic vinyl acetals, first discovered by Coates nearly forty years ago and rarely applied since. We explore the mediation of this rearrangement by Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acids and demonstrate the synthetic utility of the products through a concise synthesis of the iridoid natural product isoneomatatabiol.

         <title>Novel energy platform for the directed charge transfer in the cascade Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction for  CO2 photoreduction without the need for a cocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A universal strategy is developed to construct a cascade Z&#8208;scheme system, in which an effective energy platform is a core to direct charge transfer and separation, blocking the unexpected type&#8208;II charge transfer pathway. The dimension&#8208;matched (001)TiO  2  &#8208;g&#8208;C  3  N  4  /BiVO  4  nanosheet heterojunction (T&#8208;CN/BVNS) is the first such model. The optimized cascade Z&#8208;scheme exhibits ~19&#8208;fold photoactivity improvement for CO  2  reduction to CO in the absence of cocatalysts and costly sacrificial agents under visible&#8208;light irradiation, compared with BVNS, which is also superior to other reported Z&#8208;scheme systems even with noble metals as mediators. The experimental results and DFT calculations based on Van der Waals structural models on the ultrafast timescale reveal the introduced T as the platform could not only prolong the lifetimes of spatially separated electrons and holes but also did not compromise their reduction and oxidation potentials.</dc:description>

         <title>P&#8208;block atomically dispersed antimony catalyst for highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Main&#8208;group (  s  &#8208; and  p  &#8208;block) metals are generally regarded as catalytically inactive due to the delocalized  s  /  p  &#8208;band. Herein, we successfully synthesized a  p  &#8208;block antimony single&#8208;atom catalyst (Sb SAC) with the Sb&#8208;N  4  configuration for efficient catalysis of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The resulting Sb SAC exhibits superior ORR activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.86 V and excellent stability, which outperforms many transition&#8208;metal (TM,  d  &#8208;block) based SACs and commercial Pt/C. In addition, it presents an excellent power density of 184.6 mW cm  &#8208;2  and a high specific capacity (803.5 mAh g  &#8208;1  ) in Zn&#8208;air battery. Both experiment and theoretical calculation manifest that the active catalytic sites are positively charged Sb&#8208;N  4  single&#8208;metal sites, which have closed  d  shells. Density of states (DOS) results unveil the  p  orbital of the atomically dispersed Sb cation in Sb SAC can easily interact with O  2  &#8208;  p  orbital to form hybrid states, facilitating the charge transfer and generating appropriate adsorption strength for oxygen intermediates, lowering the energy barrier and modulating the rate&#8208;determining step. This work sheds light on the atomic&#8208;level preparing  p  &#8208;block Sb metal catalyst for highly active ORR, and further provides valuable guidelines for the rational design of other main&#8208;group&#8208;metal SACs.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of unsymmetrical components in metallo&#8208;supramolecular chemistry allows for low&#8208; symmetry architectures with anisotropic cavities toward guest&#8208;binding with high specificity and affinity. Unsymmetrical ditopic ligands mixed with Pd(II) have the potential to self&#8208;assemble into reduced symmetry Pd  2  L  4  metallo&#8208;architectures. Mixtures of isomers can form, however, resulting in potentially undesirable heterogeneity within a system. Therefore it is paramount to be able to design components that preferentially form a single isomer. Previous data suggested that computational methods could predict with reasonable accuracy whether unsymmetrical ligands would preferentially self&#8208;assemble into a single isomer under constraints of geometrical mismatch. We successfully apply a collaborative computational and experimental workflow to mitigate costly trial&#8208;and&#8208;error synthetic approaches. Our low&#8208;cost computational workflow rapidly constructs new unsymmetrical ligands (and Pd  2  L  4  cage isomers) and ranks their likelihood for forming  cis  &#8208;Pd  2  L  4  assemblies. From this narrowed search space, we successfully synthesised four new low&#8208;symmetry,  cis  &#8208;Pd  2  L  4  cages, with cavities of different shapes and sizes.</dc:description>

         <title>Single dynamic covalent bond tailored responsive molecular junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Responsive molecular devices are one of the core units for molecular electronics, and dynamic covalent bonds (DCBs) provide the opportunity for the fabrication of responsive molecular devices. Herein we employ a single dynamic acyl hydrazone bond to fabricate tailored molecular devices using the scanning tunneling microscopy break&#8208;junction technique (STM&#8208;BJ) and the eutectic Ga&#8208;In technique (EGaIn). We found that the single&#8208;DCB&#8208;tailored molecular devices exhibited&#160;acid&#8208;base and/or photo&#8208;thermal response with three well&#8208;defined molecular conductance states. The reversible switching has the ON/OFF ratio of ~10 between each state for single&#8208;molecule junctions and ~3 for the SAMs&#8208;based molecular junctions. Combined with the density functional theory calculations, we revealed that the multiple conductance states of these molecular junctions originate from the dynamic acyl hydrazone bond exchange and C=N isomerization. Our work opens the avenue towards the design of tailored single&#8208;molecule electrical devices by implanting dynamic covalent bonds in molecular architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Mass spectrometry imaging reveals in situ behaviors of multiple components in aerosol particles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The inhalation of atmospheric particles is toxicological to human health. However, as a complex mixture, tracing the behaviors of multiple components from real aerosol particles is crucial but unachievable by the existing methods. Here, taking advantage of the intrinsic fingerprints of elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC) in carbonaceous aerosol (CA) upon laser irradiation, we proposed a label&#8208;free mass spectrometry imaging method to visualize and quantify the deposition, translocation and component variation of CA in organs. With this method, the heterogeneous deposition, clearance and release behavior of CA in lung, that more OC was released in parenchyma and OC was cleared faster than EC, was observed. The translocation of CA to extrapulmonary organs including kidney, liver, spleen and even brain was also verified and quantified. By comparing the ratio of OC to EC, an organ&#8208;specific release behavior of OC from CA during circulation was revealed.&#160; In orthotopic lung and liver tumor, OC was found to penetrate more into tumor foci than EC. This technique provides deeper information for understanding the systemic health effects of aerosol particles.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding and Calibration of Charge Storage Mechanism in Cyclic Voltammetry Curves</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Noticeable pseudo&#8208;capacitance behaviour out of charge storage mechanism (CSM) has attracted intensive studies because it can provide both high energy density and large output power. Although cyclic voltammetry is recognized as the feasible electrochemical technique to determine it quantitatively in the previous works, the results are inferior due to uncertainty in the definitions and application conditions. Herein, three successive treatments, including de&#8208;polarization, de&#8208;residual and de&#8208;background, as well as a non&#8208;linear fitting algorithm are employed for the first time to calibrate the different CSM contribution of three typical cathode materials, LiFePO4, LiMn2O4 and Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7, and achieve well&#8208;separated physical capacitance, pseudo&#8208;capacitance and diffusive contributions to the total capacity. This work can eliminate misunderstanding concepts and correct ambiguous results of the pseudo&#8208;capacitance contribution, and recognize the essence of CSM in electrode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Discharge&#8208;Induced Enhancement of the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fundamental understanding of the surface reconstruction induced by the applied potential is of great significance for enhancing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, we show that a previously overlooked discharge current in the low applied potential region also leads to in situ electrochemical activation of a nitrogen&#8208;doped nickel oxyhydroxide surface. We exploit the fact that doping of heteroatoms weakens the surface structure, and hence, a weak discharge current originating from the capacitive nature of nickel oxyhydroxide has a strong structure&#8208;reforming ability to promote the formation of nitrogen and oxygen vacancies. The current density at 1.4 V (vs. Hg/HgO) can dramatically increase by as much as 31.3% after discharge in the low applied potential region. This work provides insight into in situ enhancement of the OER and suggests that the low applied potential region must be a primary consideration in evaluating the origin of the activity of electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Cryo&#8208;electron Microscopy Imaging of Alzheimer's Amyloid&#8208;beta 42 Oligomer Displayed on a Functionally and Structurally Relevant Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A functional and structural A&#946;42&#8208;oligomer equivalent, created by fusing A&#946;42 to the oligomerizing, soluble domain of the &#945;&#8208;hemolysin (&#945;HL) toxin, share major structural, functional, and biological properties with Alzheimer's wild&#8208;type A&#946;42 oligomers. Cryo&#8208;EM studies reveal that the &#945;HL&#8208;displayed oligomers structurally remain a well&#8208;defined stoichiometry, providing a stable mimetic antigen for the development of conformation&#8208;specific antibodies.







Abstract
Amyloid&#8208;&#946; peptide (A&#946;) oligomers are pathogenic species of amyloid aggregates in Alzheimer's disease. Like certain protein toxins, A&#946; oligomers permeabilize cellular membranes, presumably through a pore formation mechanism. Owing to their structural and stoichiometric heterogeneity, the structure of these pores remains to be characterized. We studied a functional A&#946;42&#8208;pore equivalent, created by fusing A&#946;42 to the oligomerizing, soluble domain of the &#945;&#8208;hemolysin (&#945;HL) toxin. Our data reveal A&#946;42&#8208;&#945;HL oligomers to share major structural, functional, and biological properties with wild&#8208;type A&#946;42&#8208;pores. Single&#8208;particle cryo&#8208;EM analysis of A&#946;42&#8208;&#945;HL oligomers (with an overall 3.3&#8197;&#197; resolution) reveals the A&#946;42&#8208;pore region to be intrinsically flexible. The A&#946;42&#8208;&#945;HL oligomers will allow many of the features of the wild&#8208;type amyloid oligomers to be studied that cannot be otherwise, and may be a highly specific antigen for the development of immuno&#8208;base diagnostics and therapies.

         <title>Artificial Light&#8208;Harvesting Systems Based on AIEgen&#8208;branched Rotaxane Dendrimers for Efficient Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel artificial light&#8208;harvesting system based on AIEgen&#8208;branched rotaxane dendrimers has been successfully constructed which displayed impressive generation&#8208;dependent photocatalytic performances for both photooxidation reaction and aerobic cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reaction.







Abstract
Aiming at the construction of novel platform for efficient light harvesting, the precise synthesis of a new family of AIEgen&#8208;branched rotaxane dendrimers was successful realized from an AIEgen&#8208;functionalized [2]rotaxane through a controllable divergent approach. In the resultant AIE macromolecules, up to twenty&#8208;one AIEgens located at the tails of each branches, thus making them the first successful example of AIEgen&#8208;branched dendrimers. Attributed to the solvent&#8208;induced switching feature of the rotaxane branches, the integrated rotaxane dendrimers displayed interesting dynamic feature upon the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) process. Moreover, novel artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems were further constructed based on these AIEgen&#8208;branched rotaxane dendrimers, which revealed impressive generation&#8208;dependent photocatalytic performances for both photooxidation reaction and aerobic cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) reaction.

         <dc:description>
Polymers exhibiting near&#8208;infrared thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) or room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence are prepared from four boron&#8208;difluoride&#8208;curcuminoid&#8208;based monomers. Incorporation of TADF&#8208;active materials into water&#8208;soluble polymer dots (Pdots) and subsequent antibody conjugation enabled near&#8208;infrared immunofluorescent labeling of SK&#8208;BR3 human breast&#8208;cancer cells.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared&#8208;emitting polymers were prepared using four boron&#8208;difluoride&#8208;curcuminoid&#8208;based monomers using ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP). Well&#8208;defined polymers with molecular weights of &#8776;20&#8197;kDa and dispersities &lt;1.07 were produced and exhibited near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission in solution and in the solid state with photoluminescence quantum yields (&#934;PL) as high as 0.72 and 0.18, respectively. Time&#8208;resolved emission spectroscopy revealed thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) in polymers containing highly planar dopants, whereas room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence dominated with twisted species. Density functional theory demonstrated that rotation about the donor&#8211;acceptor linker can give rise to TADF, even where none would be expected based on calculations using ground&#8208;state geometries. Incorporation of TADF&#8208;active materials into water&#8208;soluble polymer dots (Pdots) gave NIR&#8208;emissive nanoparticles, and conjugation of these Pdots with antibodies enabled immunofluorescent labeling of SK&#8208;BR3 human breast&#8208;cancer cells.

         <title>Liquid Droplet Formation and Facile Cytosolic Translocation of IgG in the Presence of Attenuated Cationic Amphiphilic Lytic Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large amounts of antibodies can be rapidly delivered into cells from coacervates (lipid droplet) formed by mixing a fluorescently labeled antibody and a delivery peptide, as reported by Shiroh Futaki and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202105527). The mode of delivery is a mysterious phenomenon, which is accompanied by the structural changes of the cell membranes like a drop of ink on the surface of water. The cover illustration shows a representation of the intracellular delivery of antibodies by coacervate.

&lt;p&gt;Large amounts of antibodies can be rapidly delivered into cells from coacervates (lipid droplet) formed by mixing a fluorescently labeled antibody and a delivery peptide, as reported by Shiroh Futaki and co-workers in their Research Article (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202105527"&gt;10.1002/anie.202105527&lt;/a&gt;). The mode of delivery is a mysterious phenomenon, which is accompanied by the structural changes of the cell membranes like a drop of ink on the surface of water. The cover illustration shows a representation of the intracellular delivery of antibodies by coacervate. This research has realized the first intracellular delivery of antibodies using liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation.

The transformation pathway for magic&#8208;size clusters (MSCs) with absorption doublets has remained unknown. Meng Zhang, Jianrong Zeng, Kui Yu et&#8197;al. propose in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202104986) that the transformation from the MSCs with characteristic optical absorption at 373/393&#8197;nm (dMSC&#8208;393) to those at 433/460&#8197;nm (dMSC&#8208;460) occurs via the addition reaction of the CdSe monomers to the precursor compound of dMSC&#8208;393.

         <title>Amphiphilic Iodine(III) Reagents for the Lipophilization of Peptides in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphiphilic hypervalent iodine reagents enable the alkynylation of cysteine residues in peptides with lipophilic groups in water. The reaction proceeds in neutral standard buffers with high efficiency for a broad range of peptides and one protein. The thioalkynes can be converted into cleavable thioesters under acidic conditions.







Abstract
We report the functionalization of cysteine residues with lipophilic alkynes bearing a silyl group or an alkyl chain using amphiphilic ethynylbenziodoxolone reagents (EBXs). The reactions were carried out in buffer (pH&#8197;6 to 9), without organic co&#8208;solvent or removal of oxygen, either at 37&#8201;&#176;C or room temperature. The transformation led to a significant increase of peptide lipophilicity and worked for aromatic thiols, homocysteine, cysteine, and peptides containing 4 to 18 amino acids. His6&#8208;Cys&#8208;Ubiquitin was also alkynylated under physiological conditions. Under acidic conditions, the thioalkynes were converted into thioesters, which could be cleaved in the presence of hydroxylamine.

         <title>Dynamic Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution of Tetrazines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All the advantages of dynamic covalent chemistry and the versatility of the tetrazine moiety has been combined in a novel exchange reaction: The nucleophilic aromatic substitution of tetrazines (SNTz) with phenols and alkyl thiols. Not only sophisticated structures could be easily synthesized, but more importantly, post&#8208;functionalization by IEDDA or photolysis of the compounds show that SNTz unleashes a huge potential of applications.







Abstract
A dynamic nucleophilic aromatic substitution of tetrazines (SNTz) is presented herein. It combines all the advantages of dynamic covalent chemistry with the versatility of the tetrazine moiety. Indeed, libraries of compounds or sophisticated molecular structures can be easily obtained, which are susceptible to post&#8208;functionalization by inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction, which also locks the exchange. Additionally, the structures obtained can be disassembled upon the application of the right stimulus, either UV irradiation or a suitable chemical reagent. Moreover, SNTz is compatible with the imine chemistry of anilines. The high potential of this methodology has been proved by building two responsive supramolecular systems: A macrocycle that displays a light&#8208;induced release of acetylcholine; and a truncated [4+6] tetrahedral shape&#8208;persistent fluorescent cage, which is disassembled by thiols unless it is post&#8208;stabilized by IEDDA.

         <title>Control Viscoelasticity of Polymer Networks with Crosslinks of Superposed Fast and Slow Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular crosslink of superposed fast and slow dynamics is reported by Hao Chen, Yebang Tan et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202105112). This crosslink exhibits quantitatively tailored molecular dynamics. The well&#8208;defined molecular dynamics of the crosslinks enables the precise control of the viscoelasticity and mechanical response of the resulting polymer networks at the molecular level.

&lt;p&gt;A supramolecular crosslink of superposed fast and slow dynamics is reported by Hao Chen, Yebang Tan et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202105112"&gt;10.1002/anie.202105112&lt;/a&gt;). This crosslink exhibits quantitatively tailored molecular dynamics. The well-defined molecular dynamics of the crosslinks enables the precise control of the viscoelasticity and mechanical response of the resulting polymer networks at the molecular level.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Deficient Heteroacenes that Contain Two Boron Atoms: Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescence Based on a Push&#8208;Pull Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective strategy to endow an acene skeleton with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission properties is reported by Shigehiro Yamaguchi and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202106642). Embedding boron and oxygen atoms furnishes a push&#8208;pull structure along the periphery of the acene skeleton. In particular, a thienothiophene&#8208;based dibora&#8208;heteroacene exhibits a sharp NIR emission band with a significantly narrow band width.

         <title>Origin of the &#945;&#8208;Effect in SN2 Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#945;&#8208;effect is a &#8220;reactivity booster&#8221; that affords the less basic peroxide (HOO&#8722;) the edge over hydroxide (HO&#8722;) in the Grand Prix of SN2 Reactivity! In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202106053), Trevor&#8197;A. Hamlin et&#8197;al. equip researchers with two criteria that &#945;&#8208;nucleophiles need to fulfill to exhibit an &#945;&#8208;effect: (i) a small HOMO lobe on the nucleophilic center, to reduce the destabilizing Pauli repulsion with the substrate; and (ii) a high energy HOMO to overcome the loss of favorable orbital overlap with the substrate.

         <title>A Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II Emissive Chromium(III) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chromium(III) polypyridyl complexes typically emit in the red or NIR&#8208;I spectral region. We report a chromium(III) complex, which emits at 1067&#8197;nm at 77&#8197;K upon excitation at 450&#8197;nm.







Abstract
The combination of &#960;&#8208;donating amido with &#960;&#8208;accepting pyridine coordination units in a tridentate chelate ligand causes a strong nephelauxetic effect in a homoleptic CrIII complex, which shifts its luminescence to the NIR&#8208;II spectral range. Previously explored CrIII polypyridine complexes typically emit between 727 and 778&#8197;nm (in the red to NIR&#8208;I spectral region), and ligand design strategies have so far concentrated on optimizing the ligand field strength. The present work takes a fundamentally different approach and focusses on increasing metal&#8211;ligand bond covalence to shift the ruby&#8208;like 2E emission of CrIII to 1067&#8197;nm at 77&#8197;K.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Enabled Organocatalyzed Controlled Alternating Terpolymerization of Perfluorinated Vinyl Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free photoredox catalyzed controlled alternating terpolymerization of perfluorinated vinyl ethers has been established, enabling the on&#8208;demand synthesis of various fluorinated terpolymers driven by light. This method offers a versatile and convenient platform to tailor fluoropolymers, which facilitates the preparation of novel block copolymers and engineering of high&#8208;performance solid terpolymer electrolytes.







Abstract
Polymerizations of perfluorinated vinyl ethers (PFVEs) provide an important category of fluoropolymers that have received considerable interests in applications. In this work, we report the development of an organocatalyzed controlled radical alternating terpolymerization of PFVEs and vinyl ethers (VEs) under visible&#8208;light irradiation. This method not only enables the synthesis of a broad scope of fluorinated terpolymers of low dispersities and high chain&#8208;end fidelity, facilitating tuning the chemical compositions by rationally choosing the type and/or ratio of comonomers, but also allows temporal control of chain&#8208;growth, as well as the preparation of a variety of novel fluorinated block copolymers. To showcase the versatility of this method, fluorinated alternating terpolymers have been synthesized and customized to simultaneously display a variety of desirable properties for solid polymer electrolyte design, creating new opportunities in high&#8208;performance energy storage devices.

         <title>Photoinduced Reversible Semicrystalline&#8208;to&#8208;Amorphous State Transitions of Stereoregular Azopolyesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rapid and reversible transition in aggregation structure of stereoregular azopolyesters between the semicrystalline and amorphous states can be easily manipulated via the reversible cis&#8211;trans photoisomerization of the azobenzene moieties in the side chains.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of isotactic azobenzene&#8208;based polyesters (azopolyesters) with main&#8208;chain chirality via highly enantioselective resolution copolymerization of racemic azobenzene&#8208;containing epoxides with cyclic anhydrides. All polyesters with trans&#8208;azobenzene moieties were found to be semicrystalline materials with melting temperatures of 153&#8211;231&#8201;&#176;C, while the corresponding isotactic cis&#8208;azopolyesters were amorphous. The azobenzene groups in the copolymers exhibited reversible trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis and cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans photoisomerization upon irradiation with light. This demonstrates that the crystallinity of isotactic azopolyesters can be manipulated via photoinduced reversible isomerization. In addition, mixing isotactic trans&#8208;polyesters with different enantiomeric configurations in a 1:1 mass ratio afforded crystalline stereocomplexes for which the crystalline behavior differed significantly from those of the component enantiomer. Also, photoinduced reversible transitions between semicrystalline and amorphous states were observed in various stereocomplexes of isotactic trans&#8208;azopolyesters, similar to the isotactic azopolyesters themselves.

         <title>Coordination Polymer Glasses with Lava and Healing Ability for High&#8208;Performance Gas Sieving</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;healing gas separation membranes based on coordination polymers (CPs) are reported by Xiao Feng, Bo Wang et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202102047). The low viscosity in the molten state and the low vitrification temperature equips the CPs with good processability and self&#8208;healing properties. Thin glass membranes can be prepared by hot&#8208;pressing or hot&#8208;casting methods, and they exhibit excellent molecular size&#8208;exclusive effect for gas separation.

         <title>Sodium&#8208;Decorated Amorphous/Crystalline RuO2 with Rich Oxygen Vacancies: A Robust pH&#8208;Universal Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na&#8208;doped amorphous/crystalline RuO2 with rich oxygen vacancies was developed as a highly active pH&#8208;universal OER electrocatalyst. Its high acid corrosion and oxidation resistance under the OER conditions result in its extremely high acidic catalytic stability. Theoretical calculations reveal the formation of Na&#8208;doped and oxygen vacancy&#8208;containing structures is the key to increasing the OER activity of RuO2.







Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key reaction for many electrochemical devices. To date, many OER electrocatalysts function well in alkaline media, but exhibit poor performances in neutral and acidic media, especially the acidic stability. Herein, sodium&#8208;decorated amorphous/crystalline RuO2 with rich oxygen vacancies (a/c&#8208;RuO2) was developed as a pH&#8208;universal OER electrocatalyst. The a/c&#8208;RuO2 shows remarkable resistance to acid corrosion and oxidation during OER, which leads to an extremely high catalytic stability, as confirmed by a negligible overpotential increase after continuously catalyzing OER for 60&#8197;h at pH=1. Besides, a/c&#8208;RuO2 also exhibits superior OER activities to commercial RuO2 and most reported OER catalysts under all pH conditions. Theoretical calculations indicated that the introduction of Na dopant and oxygen vacancy in RuO2 weakens the adsorption strength of the OER intermediates by engineering the d&#8208;band center, thereby lowering the energy barrier for OER.

         <title>Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification Unlocks a 2D&#8208;to&#8208;3D Switch in MOF Breathing Response: A Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;Diffraction Mapping Study</title>

         <dc:description>
Post&#8208;synthetic modification of diamondoid MOF SHF&#8208;61 generates its methylamide analogue [(Me2NH2)[In(BDC&#8208;NH(CO)Me)], SHF&#8208;62, as single crystals. Resulting ligand steric demands and H&#8208;bonding capability lead to a change in dimensionality of the MOF breathing behaviour from 2D breathing (pore width) to 3D breathing (pore width and length), which has been mapped by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.







Abstract
Post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) of the interpenetrated diamondoid metal&#8211;organic framework (Me2NH2)[In(BDC&#8208;NH2)2] (BDC&#8208;NH2=aminobenzenedicarboxylate) SHF&#8208;61 proceeds quantitatively in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal manner to yield the acetamide derivative (Me2NH2)[In(BDC&#8208;NHC(O)Me)2] SHF&#8208;62. Continuous breathing behaviour during activation/desolvation is retained upon PSM, but pore closing now leads to ring&#8208;flipping to avert steric clash of amide methyl groups of the modified ligands. This triggers a reduction in the amplitude of the breathing deformation in the two dimensions associated with pore diameter, but a large increase in the third dimension associated with pore length. The MOF is thereby converted from predominantly 2D breathing (in SHF&#8208;61) to a distinctly 3D breathing motion (in SHF&#8208;62) indicating a decoupling of the pore&#8208;width and pore&#8208;length breathing motions. These breathing motions have been mapped by a series of single&#8208;crystal diffraction studies.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Modified Phthalocyanine&#8208;Based Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Films for Polarity&#8208;Selective Chemiresistive Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;modification of phthalocyanine&#8208;based two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8208;organic framework (2D c&#8208;MOF) films by grafting aliphatic alkyl chains is developed for achieving high&#8208;performance polarity&#8208;selective chemiresisitive sensing toward humidity and polar alcohols.







Abstract
2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) are emerging as electroactive materials for chemiresistive sensors, but selective sensing with fast response/recovery is a challenge. Phthalocyanine&#8208;based Ni2[MPc(NH)8] 2D c&#8208;MOF films are presented as active layers for polarity&#8208;selective chemiresisitors toward water and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Surface&#8208;hydrophobic modification by grafting aliphatic alkyl chains on 2D c&#8208;MOF films decreases diffused analytes into the MOF backbone, resulting in a considerably accelerated recovery progress (from ca. 50 to ca. 10&#8197;s) during humidity sensing. Toward VOCs, the sensors deliver a polarity&#8208;selective response among alcohols but no signal for low&#8208;polarity aprotic hydrocarbons. The octadecyltrimethoxysilane&#8208;modified Ni2[MPc(NH)8] based sensor displays high&#8208;performance methanol sensing with fast response (36&#8197;s)/recovery (13&#8197;s) and a detection limit as low as 10&#8197;ppm, surpassing reported room&#8208;temperature chemiresistors.

A ligand&#8208;desorption process during calcination was followed for metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;supported 2&#8208;phenylethanethiolate&#8208;protected gold (Au) 25&#8208;atom metal nanoclusters (NCs) using five experimental techniques by Yuichi Negishi and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202104911). Based on the obtained knowledge, a method to form a metal&#8208;oxide layer on the surface of Au NCs while preventing their aggregation was established and thereby creation of a water&#8208;splitting photocatalyst with high activity and stability was achieved.

         <title>Dynamics of Meso&#8211;Chiral Interconversion in a Butterfly&#8208;Shape Overcrowded Alkene Rotor Tunable by Solvent Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 30, Page 16466-16471, July 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A butterfly&#8208;shape overcrowded alkene rotor was synthesized, and its meso&#8211;chiral diastereomeric interconversion processes were elucidated in different solvents. The interconversion has nontrivial bimodal dynamics involving two mechanisms, rim flip and double bond flip. The rotor shows a preference for meso cis&#8208;conformation in aromatic solvents and chiral trans&#8208;conformation in non&#8208;aromatic solvents.







Abstract
Elucidation of dynamics of molecular rotational motion is an essential part and challenging area of research. We demonstrate reversible diastereomeric interconversion of a molecular rotor composed of overcrowded butterfly&#8208;shape alkene (FDF). Its inherent dual rotatory motion (two rotors, one stator) with interconversion between two diastereomers, chiral trans&#8208;FDF and meso cis&#8208;FDF forms, has been examined in detail upon varying temperatures and solvents. The free energy profile of 180&#176; revolution of one rotor part has a bimodal shape with unevenly positioned maxima (transition states). FDF in aromatic solvents adopts preferentially meso cis&#8208;conformation, while in non&#8208;aromatic solvents a chiral trans&#8208;conformation is more abundant owing to the solvent interactions with peripheral hexyl chains (solvophobic effect). Moderate correlations between the trans&#8208;FDF/cis&#8208;FDF ratio and solvent parameters, such as refractive index, polarizability, and viscosity were found.

(right) The correlation between OER activity and in situ conductivity at large current density (50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Inset shows the double exchange interactions between high valency transition&#8208;metal ions with different d orbital occupancies in the lattice of OER active intermediates containing metal&#8208;oxyl bond (MIV&#8722;O.).







Abstract
Motivated by in silico predictions that Co, Rh, and Ir dopants would lead to low overpotentials to improve OER activity of Ni&#8208;based hydroxides, we report here an experimental confirmation on the altered OER activities for a series of metals (Mo, W, Fe, Ru, Co, Rh, Ir) doped into &#947;&#8208;NiOOH. The in situ electrical conductivity for metal doped &#947;&#8208;NiOOH correlates well with the trend in enhanced OER activities. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to rationalize the in situ conductivity of the key intermediate states of metal doped &#947;&#8208;NiOOH during OER. The simultaneous increase of OER activity with intermediate conductivity was later rationalized by their intrinsic connections to the double exchange (DE) interaction between adjacent metal ions with various d orbital occupancies, serving as an indicator for the key metal&#8208;oxo radical character, and an effective descriptor for the mechanistic evaluation and theoretical guidance in design and screening of efficient OER catalysts.

         <title>A Bubble&#8208;Assisted Approach for Patterning Nanoscale Molecular Aggregates</title>

A new approach to pattern functional organic molecules with a template of foams has been developed, and this approach can achieve a resolution of sub 100&#8197;nm currently. Using a kind of water&#8208;soluble porphyrin, we elucidate the hierarchal assembly structure and molecular interactions in bubble system.







Abstract
We demonstrate a new approach to pattern functional organic molecules with a template of foams, and achieve a resolution of sub 100&#8197;nm. The bubble&#8208;assisted assembly (BAA) process is consisted of two periods, including bubble evolution and molecular assembly, which are dominated by the Laplace pressure and molecular interactions, respectively. Using TPPS (meso&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;sulfonatophenyl) porphyrin), we systematically investigate the patterns and assembly behaviour in the bubble system with a series of characterizations, which show good uniformity in nanoscale resolution. Theoretical simulations reveal that TPPS's J&#8208;aggregates contribute to the ordered construction of molecular patterns. Finally, we propose an empirical rule for molecular patterning approach, that the surfactant and functional molecules should have the same type of charge in a two&#8208;component system. This approach exhibits promising feasibility to assemble molecular patterns at nanoscale resolution for micro/nano functional devices.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Nonlinear&#8208;Optical van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals Beryllium Borates**

We propose a design strategy to achieve van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals (vdW) deep&#8208;ultraviolet (DUV) nonlinear&#8208;optical (NLO) materials. Berborite Be2BO5H3 with trigonal (BO3)&#8208;(BeO4H) layers and beryllium metaborate BeB2O4 with tetragonal (BO4)&#8208;(BeO4) layers are predicted as two promising vdW DUV NLO crystal candidates, exhibiting a good DUV NLO performance balance with ultrawide optical band gaps, strong NLO effects, and sufficiently large birefringence.







Abstract
Van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals (vdW) deep&#8208;ultraviolet (DUV) nonlinear&#8208;optical (NLO) materials hold great potential to extend DUV NLO applications to two dimensions, but they are rare in nature. In this study, we propose a design principle to realize vdW DUV NLO materials via structural evolution from the non&#8208;vdW (BO3)&#8208;(BeO3F) layers in KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF) to the vdW (BO3)&#8208;(BeO4H) layers in berborite Be2BO5H3 (BBH) and the vdW (BO4)&#8208;(BeO4) layers in beryllium metaborate BeB2O4 (BEBO). Based on first&#8208;principles calculations, the fundamental NLO properties of BBH and BEBO demonstrate that a balanced DUV NLO performance can be achieved in these two systems. Importantly, BBH, a layered material existing in nature, can achieve an available DUV phase&#8208;matched output with strong second harmonic generation (SHG) for 177.3/193.7&#8197;nm DUV lasers, which is almost identical to that of KBBF. Remarkably, BEBO shows an excellent DUV SHG capacity and an even shorter phase&#8208;matching wavelength than KBBF. Therefore, the newly discovered vdW BBH and BEBO, once verified by experiments, could provide an ideal platform to study DUV NLO effects in three dimensions and two dimensions.

The formation of oxygen vacancies in VO&#8208;rich Pt/TiO2 optimizes the Gibbs free energy for hydrogen intermediate adsorption on Pt clusters, and promotes the hydrogen spillover effect from Pt clusters to the TiO2 support, which boosts the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
The catalytic activity of metal clusters is closely related with the support; however, knowledge on the influence of the support on the catalytic activity is scarce. We demonstrate that Pt nanoclusters (NCs) anchored on porous TiO2 nanosheets with rich oxygen vacancies (VO&#8208;rich Pt/TiO2) and deficient oxygen vacancies (VO&#8208;deficient Pt/TiO2), display significantly different catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), in which VO&#8208;rich Pt/TiO2 shows a mass activity of 45.28&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.1&#8197;V vs. RHE, which is 16.7 and 58.8 times higher than those of VO&#8208;deficient Pt/TiO2 and commercial Pt/C, respectively. DFT calculations and in&#8197;situ Raman spectra suggest that porous TiO2 with rich oxygen vacancies can simultaneously achieve reversed charge transfer (electrons transfer from TiO2 to Pt NCs) and enhanced hydrogen spillover from Pt NCs to the TiO2 support, which leads to electron&#8208;rich Pt NCs being amenable to proton reduction of absorbed H*, as well as the acceleration of hydrogen desorption at Pt catalytic sites&#8212;both promoting the HER. Our work provides a new strategy for rational design of highly efficient HER catalysts.

Reconfigurable dynamic assembly/disassembly of light&#8208;activated colloidal motor swarms like the emergent behaviors of living systems through programmable modulation of a structured illumination is presented.







Abstract
We report robust control over the dynamic assembly, disassembly, and reconfiguration of light&#8208;activated molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) colloidal motor swarms with features not possible in equilibrium systems. A photochemical reaction produces chemical gradients across the MoS2 colloidal motors to drive them to move. Under illumination of a gradient light, these colloidal motors display a positive phototactic motion. Mesoscale simulations prove that the self&#8208;diffusiophoresis induced by the locally consumed oxygen gradient across MoS2 colloidal motors dominates the phototactic process. By programming the structured illumination, the collective migration and well&#8208;defined shapes of colloidal motor swarms can be externally regulated. The successful realization of programmable swarm transformation of colloidal motors like the emergent behaviors of living systems in nature provides a direct proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for active soft materials and systems, with adaptive and interactive functions.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Conformer&#8208;Induced Formation of Zirconium&#8211;Organic Framework for Methane Storage and MTO Product Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 30, Page 16521-16528, July 19, 2021. </description>

One topologically unprecedented zirconium&#8211;organic framework was successfully assembled by virtue of a used and semirigid tricarboxylate ligand via ligand&#8208;conformer&#8208;induction. The spe&#8208;MOF exhibits relatively high methane storage capacity and efficient MTO product separation performance due to its integrated features, shedding light on the development of novel zirconium&#8208;based adsorbents by the utilization of semirigid organic linkers aiming advanced applications.







Abstract
In pursuit of novel adsorbents with efficient adsorptive gas storage and separation capabilities remains highly desired and challenging. Although the documented zirconium&#8208;tricarboxylate&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have displayed a variety of topologies encompassing underlying and geometry mismatch ones, the employed organic linkers are exclusively rigid and poorly presenting one type of conformation in the resultant structures. Herein, a used and semirigid tricarboxylate ligand of H3TATAB was judiciously selected to isolate a zirconium&#8208;based spe&#8208;MOF after the preliminary discovery of srl&#8208;MOF. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals that the fully deprotonated TATAB linker in spe&#8208;MOF exhibits two distinct conformers, concomitant with popular Oh and rare S6 symmetrical Zr6 molecular building blocks, generating an unprecedented (3,3,12,12)&#8208;c nondefault topology. Specifically, the spe&#8208;MOF exhibits structurally higher complexity, hierarchical micropores, open metal sites free and rich electronegative groups on the pore surfaces, leading to relatively high methane storage capacity without considering the missing&#8208;linker defects and efficient MTO product separation performance.

The 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane&#8208;based electrolyte is functionalized by Li+&#8208;conductive macromolecules of Li6PS5Cl&#8208;grafted poly(ethyl cyanoacrylate) with strong polar groups, which can interact readily with the aluminum&#8208;plastic packing layer through hydrogen bond to immobilize the electrolyte. And the moisture from ambient environment can catalyze a further polymerization of the macromolecules to seal the leaking points.







Abstract
Electrolyte leakage is a severe safety concern in lithium batteries. With highly volatile 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane as solvent, the leakage related hazards are more pronounced in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. To address this concern, a leakage&#8208;proof electrolyte is delicately designed through functionalizing the commercial electrolyte by Li6PS5Cl&#8208;grafted poly(ethyl cyanoacrylate), which can interact readily with the aluminum&#8208;plastic packing through hydrogen bond to immobilize the electrolyte. The moisture from ambient can also catalyze a further polymerization of the macromolecules to seal the leaking points and thereby to solve the leakage issue, endowing Li&#8208;S batteries superior safety even in an artificial cut pouch cell. With a bare S loading of 4.9&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the battery can deliver good endurance owing to the suppressed polysulfide shuttle by its polar groups. This work enlightens the design of leakage&#8208;proof electrolyte and makes a milestone for high performance Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Lewis Base&#8211;Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8211;Enzyme Catalysis in Enantioselective Multistep One&#8208;Pot Syntheses</title>

Combining organo&#8208;, bio&#8208;, and metal&#8208;catalyst for up to six synthetic steps allowed the one&#8208;pot production line towards (enantiopure) key building blocks for natural product synthesis as well as polymer science in gram&#8208;scale. The basis was set by an in&#8208;depth investigation of the initial steps of the sequence and investigating the central role of the organocatalyst {Org: 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO)} as well as benzoic acid.







Abstract
Establishing one&#8208;pot, multi&#8208;step protocols combining different types of catalysts is one important goal for increasing efficiency in modern organic synthesis. In particular, the high potential of biocatalysts still needs to be harvested. Based on an in&#8208;depth mechanistic investigation of a new organocatalytic protocol employing two catalysts {1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO); benzoic acid (BzOH)}, a sequence was established providing starting materials for enzymatic refinement (ene reductase; alcohol dehydrogenase): A gram&#8208;scale access to a variety of enantiopure key building blocks for natural product syntheses was enabled utilizing up to six catalytic steps within the same reaction vessel.

Based on an in-depth mechanistic investigation of a new organocatalytic protocol employing two catalysts {1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO); benzoic acid (BzOH)}, a sequence was established providing starting materials for enzymatic refinement (ene reductase; alcohol dehydrogenase): A gram-scale access to a variety of enantiopure key building blocks for natural product syntheses was enabled utilizing up to six catalytic steps within the same reaction vessel.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Endocircular Li Carbon Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 30, Page 16649-16654, July 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Endocircular Li carbon rings exhibit two types of electronic states of very different nature, the ordering of which changes with the ring size. This enables possible interesting applications by excitations from the electronic ground states to states of different nature depending on the ring size.







Abstract
By employing accurate state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art many&#8208;electron quantum&#8208;chemistry methods, we establish that monocyclic carbon rings can accommodate Li guest atoms. The low&#8208;lying electronic states of these endocircular systems are analyzed and found to include both charge&#8208;separated states where the guest Li atom appears as a cation and the ring as an anion and encircled&#8208;electron states where Li and the ring are neutral. The electron binding energies of the encircled&#8208;electron states increase drastically at their highly symmetric equilibrium geometries with increasing size of the ring, and in Li@C24, this state becomes the ground state. Li is very weakly bound vertical to the rings in the low&#8208;lying encircled&#8208;electron states, hinting to van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals binding. Applcations are mentioned.

         <title>The First High&#8208;Temperature Supramolecular Radical Ferroics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 30, Page 16668-16673, July 19, 2021. </description>

The first supramolecular radical ferroics show paramagnetism, non&#8208;interacting spin moments, excellent piezoelectric and electrostrictive behaviors, as well as high&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity.







Abstract
Organic radical ferroics such as TEMPO have attracted widespread interest. However, the relatively low Curie temperature of 287&#8197;K and melting point of 311&#8197;K severely hinder its application potential. Despite extensive interest, high&#8208;temperature radical ferroics have not yet been found. Here, taking advantage of chemical design and supramolecular radical chemistry, we designed two high&#8208;temperature organic supramolecular radical ferroics [(NH3&#8208;TEMPO)([18]crown&#8208;6)](ReO4) (1) and [(NH3&#8208;TEMPO)([18]crown&#8208;6)](ClO4) (2), which can retain ferroelectricity up to 413&#8197;K and 450&#8197;K, respectively. To our knowledge, they are both the first supramolecular radical ferroics and unprecedented high&#8208;temperature radical ferroics, where the supramolecular component is vital for the stabilization of the radical and extending the working temperature window. Both also have paramagnetism, non&#8208;interacting spin moments, and excellent piezoelectric and electrostrictive behaviors comparable to that of LiNbO3.

         <title>Transition Metal Catalyst&#8208;Free, Base&#8208;Promoted 1,2&#8208;Additions of Polyfluorophenylboronates to Aldehydes and Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 30, Page 16529-16538, July 19, 2021. </description>

Herein we report a transition metal&#8208;free procedure for the base&#8208;promoted 1,2&#8208;addition of polyfluorophenylboronates to aldehydes and ketones to generate organofluorine&#8208;containing alcohols in yields up to 93&#8201;%.







Abstract
A novel protocol for the transition metal&#8208;free 1,2&#8208;addition of polyfluoroaryl boronate esters to aldehydes and ketones is reported, which provides secondary alcohols, tertiary alcohols, and ketones. Control experiments and DFT calculations indicate that both the ortho&#8208;F substituents on the polyfluorophenyl boronates and the counterion K+ in the carbonate base are critical. The distinguishing features of this procedure include the employment of commercially available starting materials and the broad scope of the reaction with a wide variety of carbonyl compounds giving moderate to excellent yields. Intriguing structural features involving O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O and O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N hydrogen bonding, as well as arene&#8208;perfluoroarene interactions, in this series of racemic polyfluoroaryl carbinols have also been addressed.

Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven iron&#8208;catalyzed nitrene transfer reactions with dioxazolones are used for intermolecular C(sp3)&#8208;N, N=S and N=P bond formation.

Abstract
Herein, visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven iron&#8208;catalyzed nitrene transfer reactions with dioxazolones for intermolecular C(sp3)&#8208;N, N=S, and N=P bond formation are described. These reactions occur with exogenous&#8208;ligand&#8208;free process and feature satisfactory to excellent yields (up to 99&#8201;%), an ample substrate scope (109 examples) under mild reaction conditions. In contrast to intramolecular C&#8722;H amidations strategies, an intermolecular regioselective C&#8722;H amidation via visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced nitrene transfer reactions is devised. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction proceeds via a radical pathway. Computational studies show that the decarboxylation of dioxazolone depends on the conversion of ground sextet state dioxazolone&#8208;bounding iron species to quartet spin state via visible&#8208;light irradiation.

         <title>Discovery of a Low Thermal Conductivity Oxide Guided by Probe Structure Prediction and Machine Learning</title>

Ba10Y6Ti4O27 has a complex aperiodic structure with the lowest thermal conductivity of any first&#8208;transition&#8208;series oxide. It is metastable, which makes it challenging to identify. Experimental exploration was focused sufficiently by structure prediction and property&#8208;targeted machine learning to enable the isolation of this material (see picture), whose structural motifs provide new insight into the control of heat transport.







Abstract
We report the aperiodic titanate Ba10Y6Ti4O27 with a room&#8208;temperature thermal conductivity that equals the lowest reported for an oxide. The structure is characterised by discontinuous occupancy modulation of each of the sites and can be considered as a quasicrystal. The resulting localisation of lattice vibrations suppresses phonon transport of heat. This new lead material for low&#8208;thermal&#8208;conductivity oxides is metastable and located within a quaternary phase field that has been previously explored. Its isolation thus requires a precisely defined synthetic protocol. The necessary narrowing of the search space for experimental investigation was achieved by evaluation of titanate crystal chemistry, prediction of unexplored structural motifs that would favour synthetically accessible new compositions, and assessment of their properties with machine&#8208;learning models.

The structure is characterised by discontinuous occupancy modulation of each of the sites and can be considered as a quasicrystal. The resulting localisation of lattice vibrations suppresses phonon transport of heat. This new lead material for low-thermal-conductivity oxides is metastable and located within a quaternary phase field that has been previously explored. Its isolation thus requires a precisely defined synthetic protocol. The necessary narrowing of the search space for experimental investigation was achieved by evaluation of titanate crystal chemistry, prediction of unexplored structural motifs that would favour synthetically accessible new compositions, and assessment of their properties with machine-learning models.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Multidimensional Characterization of Single&#8208;Molecule Dynamics in a Plasmonic Nanocavity</title>

A multi&#8208;dimensional spectroscopic platform allows measurement of structural, mechanical, and electronic transport properties of a single molecule. By simultaneous measurement and correlating electrical and optical properties of a single&#8208;molecule junction, mutually agreeable evidence of dynamic behavior of single&#8208;molecule sensitivity is extracted. Strain&#8208;induced structural changes of an isolated individual molecule in situ can thus be observed.







Abstract
Nanoscale manipulation and characterization of individual molecules is necessary to understand the intricacies of molecular structure, which governs phenomena such as reaction mechanisms, catalysis, local effective temperatures, surface interactions, and charge transport. Here we utilize Raman enhancement between two nanostructured electrodes in combination with direct charge transport measurements to allow for simultaneous characterization of the electrical, optical, and mechanical properties of a single molecule. This multi&#8208;dimensional information yields repeatable, self&#8208;consistent, verification of single&#8208;molecule resolution, and allows for detailed analysis of structural and configurational changes of the molecule in situ. These experimental results are supported by a machine&#8208;learning based statistical analysis of the spectral information and calculations to provide insight into the correlation between structural changes in a single&#8208;molecule and its charge&#8208;transport properties.

         <title>Surface oxygen Vacancies on Reduced Co3O4(100): Superoxide Formation and Ultra&#8208;Low&#8208;Temperature CO Oxidation</title>

Activated molecular oxygen (superoxide, O2&#8722;) can oxidize CO already at 120&#8197;K on B&#8208;layer terminated Co3O4(100) with oxygen vacancies. This rendered scheme illustrates how a vibrational spectrum of the adsorbed superoxide is recorded with surface action spectroscopy.







Abstract
The activation of molecular oxygen is a fundamental step in almost all catalytic oxidation reactions. We have studied this topic and the role of surface vacancies for Co3O4(100) films with a synergistic combination of experimental and theoretical methods. We show that the as&#8208;prepared surface is B&#8208;layer terminated and that mild reduction produces oxygen single and double vacancies in this layer. Oxygen adsorption experiments clearly reveal different superoxide species below room temperature. The superoxide desorbs below ca. 120&#8197;K from a vacancy&#8208;free surface and is not active for CO oxidation while superoxide on a surface with oxygen vacancies is stable up to ca. 270&#8197;K and can oxidize CO already at the low temperature of 120&#8197;K. The vacancies are not refilled by oxygen from the superoxide, which makes them suitable for long&#8208;term operation. Our joint experimental/theoretical effort highlights the relevance of surface vacancies in catalytic oxidation reactions.

         <title>Bamboo&#8208;like &#960;&#8208;Nanotubes with Tunable Helicity and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>

The 2D nanosheets hierarchical assembled into diverse bamboo&#8208;like &#960;&#8208;nanotube with tunable helicity by a &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; route. The diameter ratio of the upper to lower edge of each stacking truncated nanocone (RH) can be regulated to express the different helicity of the nanotube. The chiroptical nanoarchitectures show an enhanced and RH&#8208;dependent adjustable chirality and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL).







Abstract
We report the fabrication of an exotic bamboo&#8208;like &#960;&#8208;nanotube via the hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of a dipeptide&#8208;substituted naphthalenediimide gelator with tunable helicity and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). It was found that in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) the gelator molecules self&#8208;assembled into a bamboo&#8208;like &#960;&#8208;nanotube, which is composed of truncated nanocones and CPL active. When defining the diameter ratio of the lower to upper edge of each nanocone as a parameter to express the helicity of different nanotubes, it was found that both the helicity and CPL of these nanotubes can be adjusted by the amount of TFA. Moreover, the helicity of the nanotube can be conveyed to the achiral quantum dots (QDs) and produce a hybrid nanotube/QDs CPL active materials with adjustable dissymmetry factor. This work finds a new type self&#8208;assembled bamboo&#8208;like &#960;&#8208;nanotube and unveils their helicity and CPL control.

A self&#8208;assembled homochiral anionic cage with dual binding modes acts as an efficient chiroptical sensor with a broad substrate scope in water.







Abstract
Herein, we report the self&#8208;assembly of an anionic homochiral octahedral cage by condensing six Ga3+ cations and four trisacylhydrazone ligands. The robust nature of the hydrazone bond renders the cage stable in water, where it can take advantage of the hydrophobic effect for host&#8211;guest recognition. In addition to the internal binding site, namely, the inner cavity, the octahedral cage possesses four &#8220;windows&#8221;, each of which represents an external binding site allowing peripheral complexation. These internal and external binding sites endow the cage with the capability to bind a broad range of guests whose sizes could either be smaller than or exceed the volume of the cage&#8242;s inner cavity. Upon accommodation of a chiral guest, one of the two cage enantiomers becomes more favored than the other, producing circular&#8208;dichroism (CD) signals. The CD signal intensity of the cage is observed to be proportional to the ee value of the chiral guest, allowing a quantitative determination of the latter.

         <title>Uncovering the Role of Bicarbonate in Calcium Carbonate Formation at Near&#8208;Neutral pH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 30, Page 16707-16713, July 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An important role of bicarbonate at near&#8208;neutral pH during CaCO3 formation was found. Its structural incorporation in amorphous intermediates, revealed by a combination of potentiometric titrations, NMR, computer simulations, and other techniques, can be quantitatively explained by a model based on the binding of bicarbonate ions to pre&#8208;nucleation clusters. The findings seem to be crucial for a better understanding of, e.g., CaCO3 biomineralization.







Abstract
Mechanistic pathways relevant to mineralization are not well&#8208;understood fundamentally, let alone in the context of their biological and geological environments. Through quantitative analysis of ion association at near&#8208;neutral pH, we identify the involvement of HCO3&#8722; ions in CaCO3 nucleation. Incorporation of HCO3&#8722; ions into the structure of amorphous intermediates is corroborated by solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, complemented by quantum mechanical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. We identify the roles of HCO3&#8722; ions as being through (i)&#8197;competition for ion association during the formation of ion pairs and ion clusters prior to nucleation and (ii)&#8197;incorporation as a significant structural component of amorphous mineral particles. The roles of HCO3&#8722; ions as active soluble species and structural constituents in CaCO3 formation are of fundamental importance and provide a basis for a better understanding of physiological and geological mineralization.

     alt="Uncovering the Role of Bicarbonate in Calcium Carbonate Formation at Near-Neutral pH"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important role of bicarbonate at near-neutral pH during CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; formation was found. Its structural incorporation in amorphous intermediates, revealed by a combination of potentiometric titrations, NMR, computer simulations, and other techniques, can be quantitatively explained by a model based on the binding of bicarbonate ions to pre-nucleation clusters. The findings seem to be crucial for a better understanding of, e.g., CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; biomineralization.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mechanistic pathways relevant to mineralization are not well-understood fundamentally, let alone in the context of their biological and geological environments. Through quantitative analysis of ion association at near-neutral pH, we identify the involvement of HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions in CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nucleation. Incorporation of HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions into the structure of amorphous intermediates is corroborated by solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, complemented by quantum mechanical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. We identify the roles of HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions as being through (i)&#8197;competition for ion association during the formation of ion pairs and ion clusters prior to nucleation and (ii)&#8197;incorporation as a significant structural component of amorphous mineral particles.

         <title>FRET&#8208;Integrated Polymer Brushes for Spatially Resolved Sensing of Changes in Polymer Conformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 30, Page 16600-16606, July 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
FRET chemistry was integrated within stimuli&#8208;responsive polymer brush layers on planar substrates for spatial sensing of changing polymer conformations. Sensing was demonstrated for a variety of liquid mixture compositions, including high&#8208;resolution observation of lateral differences in polymer conformation at immiscible liquid interfaces (see picture), thus offering great potential to be leveraged for new surface&#8208;based sensing devices.







Abstract
Polymer brush surfaces that alter their physical properties in response to chemical stimuli have the capacity to be used as new surface&#8208;based sensing materials. For such surfaces, detecting the polymer conformation is key to their sensing capabilities. Herein, we report on FRET&#8208;integrated ultrathin (&lt;70&#8197;nm) polymer brush surfaces that exhibit stimuli&#8208;dependent FRET with changing brush conformation. Poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) polymers were chosen due their exceptional sensitivity to liquid mixture compositions and their ability to be assembled into well&#8208;defined polymer brushes. The brush transitions were used to optically sense changes in liquid mixture compositions with high spatial resolution (tens of micrometers), where the FRET coupling allowed for noninvasive observation of brush transitions around complex interfaces with real&#8208;time sensing of the liquid environment. Our methods have the potential to be leveraged towards greater surface&#8208;based sensing capabilities at intricate interfaces.

Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation of nitrones and coupling with different classes of sterically hindered alkynes afforded C&#8722;C or C&#8722;N atropochiral and C&#8208;centered point&#8208;chiral indenes in excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. The chiral center and axis are disposed in a distal fashion, and they are constructed via two uncorrelated stereo&#8208;determining steps.







Abstract
Reported herein is asymmetric [3+2] annulation of arylnitrones with different classes of alkynes catalyzed by chiral rhodium(III) complexes, with the nitrone acting as an electrophilic directing group. Three classes of chiral indenes/indenones have been effectively constructed, depending on the nature of the substrates. The coupling system features mild reaction conditions, excellent enantioselectivity, and high atom&#8208;economy. In particular, the coupling of N&#8208;benzylnitrones and different classes of sterically hindered alkynes afforded C&#8722;C or C&#8722;N atropochiral pentatomic biaryls with a C&#8208;centered point&#8208;chirality in excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity (45 examples, average 95.6&#8201;% ee). These chiral center and axis are disposed in a distal fashion and they are constructed via two distinct migratory insertions that are stereo&#8208;determining and are under catalyst control.

         <title>Chemical Identification of Catalytically Active Sites on Oxygen&#8208;doped Carbon Nanosheet to Decipher the High Activity for Electro&#8208;synthesis Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 30, Page 16607-16614, July 19, 2021. </description>

The oxygen&#8208;doped carbon nanosheet (OCNS900) has been demonstrated as highly effective catalyst for electrosynthesizing hydrogen peroxide with mass activity of 14.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.75&#8197;V (vs. RHE) and H2O2 production rate of 770&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in a flow cell. Chemical titration and DFT calculations were used to decipher the high activity for hydrogen peroxide production; the C=O groups are identified as the most active sites.







Abstract
Electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through two&#8208;electron (2&#8201;e&#8722;) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is an on&#8208;site and clean route. Oxygen&#8208;doped carbon materials with high ORR activity and H2O2 selectivity have been considered as the promising catalysts, however, there is still a lack of direct experimental evidence to identify true active sites at the complex carbon surface. Herein, we propose a chemical titration strategy to decipher the oxygen&#8208;doped carbon nanosheet (OCNS900) catalyst for 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR. The OCNS900 exhibits outstanding 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR performances with onset potential of 0.825&#8197;V (vs. RHE), mass activity of 14.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.75&#8197;V (vs. RHE) and H2O2 production rate of 770&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in flow cell, surpassing most reported carbon catalysts. Through selective chemical titration of C=O, C&#8722;OH, and COOH groups, we found that C=O species contributed to the most electrocatalytic activity and were the most active sites for 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR, which were corroborated by theoretical calculations.

Channelrhodopsin&#8208;2, a light driven cation channel with a retinal chromophore, undergoes a cyclic photoreaction with several photointermediates. Here, we analyze the chromophore configuration of the intermediates, which can be cryo&#8208;trapped, in detail by DNP&#8208;enhanced solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and reveal that the desensitized state is in a 13&#8208;cis,15&#8208;syn configuration. Our results also shed further light on the photocycle of the protein.







Abstract
Channelrhodopsin&#8208;2 (ChR2) is a light&#8208;gated cation channel and was used to lay the foundations of optogenetics. Its dark state X&#8208;ray structure has been determined in 2017 for the wild&#8208;type, which is the prototype for all other ChR variants. However, the mechanistic understanding of the channel function is still incomplete in terms of structural changes after photon absorption by the retinal chromophore and in the framework of functional models. Hence, detailed information needs to be collected on the dark state as well as on the different photointermediates. For ChR2 detailed knowledge on the chromophore configuration in the different states is still missing and a consensus has not been achieved. Using DNP&#8208;enhanced solid&#8208;state MAS NMR spectroscopy on proteoliposome samples, we unambiguously determined the chromophore configuration in the desensitized state, and we show that this state occurs towards the end of the photocycle.

Here, we analyze the chromophore configuration of the intermediates, which can be cryo-trapped, in detail by DNP-enhanced solid-state NMR spectroscopy and reveal that the desensitized state is in a 13-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;,15-&lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt; configuration. Our results also shed further light on the photocycle of the protein.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) is a light-gated cation channel and was used to lay the foundations of optogenetics. Its dark state X-ray structure has been determined in 2017 for the wild-type, which is the prototype for all other ChR variants. However, the mechanistic understanding of the channel function is still incomplete in terms of structural changes after photon absorption by the retinal chromophore and in the framework of functional models. Hence, detailed information needs to be collected on the dark state as well as on the different photointermediates. For ChR2 detailed knowledge on the chromophore configuration in the different states is still missing and a consensus has not been achieved. Using DNP-enhanced solid-state MAS NMR spectroscopy on proteoliposome samples, we unambiguously determined the chromophore configuration in the desensitized state, and we show that this state occurs towards the end of the photocycle.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>An All&#8208;in&#8208;One Organic Semiconductor for Targeted Photoxidation Catalysis in Hypoxic Tumor</title>

Gram&#8208;scale organic semiconductor C5N2 NPs were synthesized by a one&#8208;pot bottom&#8208;up method. The all&#8208;in&#8208;one semiconductor, with a low band gap of 1.63&#8197;eV and inherent nucleus targeting and strong photooxidation capacity, could accumulate at cell nucleus, split H2O to produce O2 and also generate cytotoxia 1O2 under high&#8208;tissue&#8208;penetrable NIR irradiation, successfully achieving effective and enhanced PDT in a hypoxic tumor.







Abstract
Tumor hypoxia severely limits the therapeutic effects of photodynamic therapy (PDT). Although many methods for oxygen generation exist, substantial safety concerns, spatiotenporal uncontrollability, limited efficacy, and complicated procedures have compromised their practical application. Here, we demonstrate a biocompatiable all&#8208;in&#8208;one organic semiconductor to provide a photoxidation catalysis mechanism of action. A facile method is developed to produce gram&#8208;level C5N2 nanoparticles (NPs)&#8208;based organic semiconductor. Under 650&#8197;nm laser irradiation, the semiconductor split water to generate O2 and simultaneously produce singlet oxygen (1O2), showing that the photocatalyst for O2 evolution and the photosensitizer (PS) for 1O2 generation could be synchronously achieved in one organic semiconductor. The inherent nucleus targeting capacity endows it with direct and efficient DNA photocleavage. These findings pave the way for developing organic semiconductor&#8208;based cancer therapeutic agents.

         <title>Azobispyrazole Family as Photoswitches Combining (Near&#8208;) Quantitative Bidirectional Isomerization and Widely Tunable Thermal Half&#8208;Lives from Hours to Years**

Azobispyrazoles are a family of bis&#8208;heteroaryl azo photoswitches that combine excellent E &#8646; Z photoisomerization yields and widely tunable Z&#8208;isomer thermal half&#8208;lives from hours to years, showing the great potential of Het&#8208;N=N&#8208;Het architecture in developing high&#8208;performance molecular photoswitches.







Abstract
Azobenzenes are classical molecular photoswitches that have been widely used. In recent endeavors of molecular design, replacing one or both phenyl rings with heteroaromatic rings has emerged as a strategy to expand molecular diversity and access improved photoswitching properties. Many mono&#8208;heteroaryl azo molecules with unique structures and/or properties have been developed, but the potential of bis&#8208;heteroaryl architectures is far from fully exploited. We report a family of azobispyrazoles, which combine (near&#8208;)quantitative bidirectional photoconversion and widely tunable Z&#8208;isomer thermal half&#8208;lives from hours to years. The two five&#8208;membered rings remarkably weaken the intramolecular steric hindrance, providing new possibilities for engineering the geometric and electronic structure of azo photoswitches. Azobispyrazoles generally exhibit twisted Z&#8208;isomers that facilitate complete Z&#8594;E photoisomerization, and their thermal stability can be broadly adjusted regardless of the twisted shape, overcoming the conflict between photoconversion (favored by the twisted shape) and Z&#8208;isomer stability (favored by the orthogonal shape) encountered by mono&#8208;heteroaryl azo switches.

H2O can directly participate in the continuous N2O&#8208;DMTM reaction through a proton&#8208;transfer&#8208;bridge over the dicopper [Cu&#8208;O&#8208;Cu] site of Cu&#8208;BEA zeolite. This can significantly boost CH3OH production rate and enhance long&#8208;term reaction stability.







Abstract
Direct oxidation of methane to methanol (DMTM) is a big challenge in C1 chemistry. We present a continuous N2O&#8208;DMTM investigation by simultaneously introducing 10&#8197;vol&#8201;% H2O into the reaction system over Cu&#8208;BEA zeolites. Combining a D2O isotopic tracer technique and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation, we for the first time demonstrate that the H2O molecules can participate in the reaction through a proton transfer route, wherein the H2O molecules can build a high&#8208;speed proton transfer bridge between the generated moieties of CH3&#8722; and OH&#8722; over the evolved mono(&#956;&#8208;oxo) dicopper ([Cu&#8208;O&#8208;Cu]2+) active site, thereby pronouncedly boosting the CH3OH selectivity (3.1&#8594;71.6&#8201;%), productivity (16.8&#8594;242.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and long&#8208;term reaction stability (10&#8594;70&#8197;h) relative to the scenario of absence of H2O. Unravelling the proton transfer of H2O over the dicopper [Cu&#8208;O&#8208;Cu]2+ site would substantially contribute to highly efficient catalyst designs for the continuous DMTM.

         <title>Ultralong&#8208;Range Polariton&#8208;Assisted Energy Transfer in Organic Microcavities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 30, Page 16661-16667, July 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultralong&#8208;range polariton&#8208;assisted energy transfer was achieved in a microcavity containing two J&#8208;aggregate cyanine dyes. The two dyes were separated by a distance of up to 2 &#956;m using a polymeric spacer layer. Here, it was confirmed that hybrid middle polariton (MP) states, composed of a mixture between the cavity photon modes and the different exciton states, act as a route for efficient ultralong&#8208;range energy transfer to energetically lower&#8208;lying states.







Abstract
Non&#8208;radiative energy transfer between spatially&#8208;separated molecules in a microcavity can occur when an excitonic state on both molecules are strongly&#8208;coupled to the same optical mode, forming so&#8208;called &#8220;hybrid&#8221; polaritons. Such energy transfer has previously been explored when thin&#8208;films of different molecules are relatively closely spaced (&#8776;100&#8197;nm). In this manuscript, we explore strong&#8208;coupled microcavities in which thin&#8208;films of two J&#8208;aggregated molecular dyes were separated by a spacer layer having a thickness of up to 2&#8197;&#956;m. Here, strong light&#8208;matter coupling and hybridisation between the excitonic transition is identified using white&#8208;light reflectivity and photoluminescence emission. We use steady&#8208;state spectroscopy to demonstrate polariton&#8208;mediated energy transfer between such coupled states over &#8220;mesoscopic distances&#8221;, with this process being enhanced compared to non&#8208;cavity control structures.

We use steady-state spectroscopy to demonstrate polariton-mediated energy transfer between such coupled states over &#8220;mesoscopic distances&#8221;, with this process being enhanced compared to non-cavity control structures.&lt;/p&gt;

Chimeric Lanthipeptides: Employing a tunable metabologenomic approach, nocathioamides&#8197;A&#8211;C were isolated and elucidated. They inaugurate a new RiPP family, characterized by a unique and hyper degree of modifications, including an intramolecular imide bridge.







Abstract
The increasing number of available genomes, in combination with advanced genome mining techniques, unveiled a plethora of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) coding for ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). The products of these BGCs often represent an enormous resource for new and bioactive compounds, but frequently, they cannot be readily isolated and remain cryptic. Here, we describe a tunable metabologenomic approach that recruits a synergism of bioinformatics in tandem with isotope&#8208; and NMR&#8208;guided platform to identify the product of an orphan RiPP gene cluster in the genomes of Nocardia terpenica IFM 0406 and 0706T. The application of this tactic resulted in the discovery of nocathioamides family as a founder of a new class of chimeric lanthipeptides I.

Mg&#8208;doped Li with about 5&#8197;wt.&#8201;% Mg (Li&#8208;Mg5) has the lowest absorption&#8208;energy of Li from density functional theory calculations. Experimental tests demonstrate that Li&#8208;Mg5 exhibits superior cycling stability to pure Li and Li&#8208;Mg10 anodes in Li metal batteries with high&#8208;loading cathode and lean electrolyte under 4.4&#8197;V high&#8208;voltage, leading to dense and less&#8208;corrosive Li deposition thus validating the simulation results.







Abstract
Lithium (Li)&#8208;magnesium (Mg) alloy with limited Mg amount, which can also be called Mg&#8208;doped Li (Li&#8208;Mg), has been considered as a potential alternative anode for high energy density rechargeable Li metal batteries. However, the optimum doping&#8208;content of Mg in Li&#8208;Mg anode and the mechanism of the improved performance are not well understood. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to investigate the effect of Mg amount in Li&#8208;Mg anode. The Li&#8208;Mg with about 5&#8197;wt.&#8201;% Mg (abbreviated as Li&#8208;Mg5) has the lowest absorption energy of Li, thus all the surface area can be &#8220;controlled&#8221; by Mg atoms, leading to the smooth and continuous deposition of Li on the surface around the Mg center. A localized high concentration electrolyte enables Li&#8208;Mg5 to exhibit the best cycling stability in Li metal batteries with high&#8208;loading cathode and lean electrolyte under 4.4&#8197;V high&#8208;voltage, which is approaching the demand of practical application. This electrolyte also helps generate an inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase, which leads to smooth, compact and less corrosion layer on the Li&#8208;Mg5 surface. Both theoretical simulations and experimental results prove that Li&#8208;Mg5 has optimum Mg content and gives best battery cycling performance.

         <title>DNA Framework&#8208;Engineered Long&#8208;Range Electrostatic Interactions for DNA Hybridization Reactions</title>

DNA frameworks contained various guest particles with different surface charges were employed to exert diverse long&#8208;range electrostatic effects on site&#8208;specifically tethered single stranded DNA. Long&#8208;range Coulomb interactions are the key factor for determining the hybridization rate of the tethered DNA to its complementary sequence.







Abstract
Long&#8208;range electrostatic interactions beyond biomolecular interaction interfaces have not been extensively studied due to the limitation in engineering electric double layers in physiological fluids. Here we find that long&#8208;range electrostatic interactions play an essential role in kinetic modulation of DNA hybridizations. Protein and gold nanoparticles with different charges are encapsulated in tetrahedral frameworks to exert diverse electrostatic effects on site&#8208;specifically tethered single DNA strands. Using this strategy, we have successfully modulated the hybridization kinetics in both bulk solution and single molecule level. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that long&#8208;range Coulomb interactions are the key factor for hybridization rates. This work validates the important role of long&#8208;range electrostatic forces in nucleic acid&#8208;biomacromolecule complexes, which may encourage new strategies of gene regulation, antisense therapy, and nucleic acid detection.

The CO ligation to two different ruthenium porphyrins on the Ag(111) surface under vacuum was investigated experimentally and theoretically. The electronic and geometric changes upon ligation as well as the energetics of the process were elucidated. The surface adaptability of the porphyrin macrocycle conformation proves crucial for CO binding.







Abstract
We assess the crucial role of tetrapyrrole flexibility in the CO ligation to distinct Ru&#8208;porphyrins supported on an atomistically well&#8208;defined Ag(111) substrate. Our systematic real&#8208;space visualisation and manipulation experiments with scanning tunnelling microscopy directly probe the ligation, while bond&#8208;resolving atomic force microscopy and X&#8208;ray standing&#8208;wave measurements characterise the geometry, X&#8208;ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy the electronic structure, and temperature&#8208;programmed desorption the binding strength. Density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory calculations provide additional insight into the functional interface. We unambiguously demonstrate that the substituents regulate the interfacial conformational adaptability, either promoting or obstructing the uptake of axial CO adducts.

         <title>Synthesis of a Boron&#8211;Imidazolate Framework Nanosheet with Dimer Copper Units for CO2 Electroreduction to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 30, Page 16687-16692, July 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemically well&#8208;defined catalysts with atomically dispersed dimer&#8208;copper sites are elaborated to modulate the reaction path of CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2RR). The BIF&#8208;102NSs catalyst with Cl&#8722; bridged dimer copper (Cu2) units shows higher catalytic activity and selectivity for C2H4, because the neighboring Cu monomers perform as regulator for varying the reaction barrier and afford distinct reaction paths compared with isolated monomers.







Abstract
Fundamental understanding of the dependence between the structure and composition on the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) would guide the rational design of highly efficient and selective electrocatalysts. A major impediment to the deep reduction CO2 to multi&#8208;carbon products is the complexity of carbon&#8211;carbon bond coupling. The chemically well&#8208;defined catalysts with atomically dispersed dual&#8208;metal sites are required for these C&#8722;C coupling involved processes. Here, we developed a catalyst (BIF&#8208;102NSs) that features Cl&#8722; bridged dimer copper (Cu2) units, which delivers high catalytic activity and selectivity for C2H4. Mechanistic investigation verifies that neighboring Cu monomers not only perform as regulator for varying the reaction barrier, but also afford distinct reaction paths compared with isolated monomers, resulting in greatly improved electroreduction performance for CO2.

The BIF-102NSs catalyst with Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; bridged dimer copper (Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) units shows higher catalytic activity and selectivity for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, because the neighboring Cu monomers perform as regulator for varying the reaction barrier and afford distinct reaction paths compared with isolated monomers.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundamental understanding of the dependence between the structure and composition on the electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) would guide the rational design of highly efficient and selective electrocatalysts. A major impediment to the deep reduction CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to multi-carbon products is the complexity of carbon&#8211;carbon bond coupling. The chemically well-defined catalysts with atomically dispersed dual-metal sites are required for these C&#8722;C coupling involved processes. Here, we developed a catalyst (BIF-102NSs) that features Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; bridged dimer copper (Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) units, which delivers high catalytic activity and selectivity for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Mechanistic investigation verifies that neighboring Cu monomers not only perform as regulator for varying the reaction barrier, but also afford distinct reaction paths compared with isolated monomers, resulting in greatly improved electroreduction performance for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Na9Bi5Os3O24: A Diamagnetic Oxide Featuring a Pronouncedly Jahn&#8211;Teller&#8208;Compressed Octahedral Coordination of Osmium(VI)</title>

A Jahn&#8211;Teller&#8208;compressed OsO6 octahedron resulting in an unprecedented large splitting of the t2g levels and a diamagnetic ground state has been observed.







Abstract
The Jahn&#8211;Teller (JT) theorem constitutes one of the most fundamental concepts in chemistry. In transition&#8208;element chemistry, the 3d4 and 3d9 configurations in octahedral complexes are particularly illustrative, where a distortion in local geometry is associated with a reduction of the electronic energy. However, there has been a lasting debate about the fact that the octahedra are found to exclusively elongate. In contrast, for Na9Bi5Os3O24, the octahedron around Os6+(5d2) is heavily compressed, lifting the degeneracy of the t2g set of 5d orbitals such that in the sense of a JT compression a diamagnetic ground state results. This effect is not forced by structural constraints, the structure offers sufficient space for osmium to shift the apical oxygen atoms to a standard distance. The relevance of these findings is far reaching, since they provide new insights in the hierarchy of perturbations defining ground states of open shell electronic systems.

Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Stacked dendrimers consisting of cofacially aligned donors and acceptors are developed by introducing three dendritic teracridan donors with orthogonal configuration and three triazine acceptors in periphery of hexaphenylbenzene skeleton. The dendritic structure and orthogonal configuration of teracridan not only make their outer acridan segments approaching to acceptor in close distance, but also fix donor and acceptor in face&#8208;to&#8208;face alignment, leading to through&#8208;space charge transfer emission with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) effect. By regulating charge transfer strength via substituent effect of acceptor, emission color of the dendrimers can be tuned from blue to yellow/red region. Solution&#8208;processed two&#8208;color white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on blue and yellow &#960;&#8208;stacked donor&#8211;acceptor dendrimers exhibit the maximum external quantum efficiency of 20.6&#8201;% and maximum power efficiency of 58.9&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art efficiency for all&#8208;TADF white OLEDs by solution process.

Formulation of conventional electrolyte composition yields a hybrid solid/liquid electrolyte that is electrochemically compatible with the Li&#8208;metal anode and the nickel&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes, which promises stable operation of a practical 10&#8208;Ah&#8208;grade pouch cell with a specific energy of &gt;450&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1.







Abstract
Rechargeable lithium&#8211;metal batteries with a cell&#8208;level specific energy of &gt;400&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 are highly desired for next&#8208;generation storage applications, yet the research has been retarded by poor electrolyte&#8211;electrode compatibility and rigorous safety concerns. We demonstrate that by simply formulating the composition of conventional electrolytes, a hybrid electrolyte was constructed to ensure high (electro)chemical and thermal stability with both the Li&#8208;metal anode and the nickel&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes. By employing the new electrolyte, Li&#8741;LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cells show favorable cycling and rate performance, and a 10&#8197;Ah Li&#8741;LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch cell demonstrates a practical specific energy of &gt;450&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. Our findings shed light on reasonable design principles for electrolyte and electrode/electrolyte interfaces toward practical realization of high&#8208;energy rechargeable batteries.

         <title>A Pair of Cobalt(III/IV) Terminal Imido Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 30, Page 16480-16486, July 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Straightforward access to a cobalt(IV) terminal imido complex was provided by one&#8208;electron oxidation of a cobalt(III) terminal imido precursor. The cobalt(IV) monoimido complex could be isolated at low temperatures in analytically pure form. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry and EPR spectroscopy corroborate the molecular structure and the d5 low&#8208;spin, S=
, electron configuration.







Abstract
The reaction of the cobalt(I) complex [(TIMMNmes)CoI](BPh4) (2) (TIMMNmes=tris&#8208;[2&#8208;(3&#8208;mesitylimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)methyl]amine) with 1&#8208;adamantylazide yields the cobalt(III) imido complex [(TIMMNmes)CoIII(NAd)](BPh4) (3) with concomitant release of dinitrogen. The N&#8208;anchor in diamagnetic 3 features an unusual, planar tertiary amine, which results from repulsive electrostatic interaction with the filled d(z2)&#8208;orbital of the cobalt ion and negative hyperconjugation with the neighboring methylene groups. One&#8208;electron oxidation of 3 with [FeCp2](OTf) provides access to the rare, high&#8208;valent cobalt(IV) imido complex [(TIMMNmes)CoIV(NAd)](OTf)2 (4). Despite a half&#8208;life of less than 1&#8197;h at room temperature, 4 could be isolated at low temperatures in analytically pure form. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry and EPR spectroscopy corroborate the molecular structure and the d5 low&#8208;spin, S=
, electron configuration. A computational analysis of 4 suggests high covalency within the CoIV=NAd bond with non&#8208;negligible spin density located at the imido moiety, which translates into substantial triplet nitrene character.

The N-anchor in diamagnetic &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; features an unusual, planar tertiary amine, which results from repulsive electrostatic interaction with the filled d(z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)-orbital of the cobalt ion and negative hyperconjugation with the neighboring methylene groups. One-electron oxidation of &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; with [FeCp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;](OTf) provides access to the rare, high-valent cobalt(IV) imido complex [(TIMMN&lt;sup&gt;mes&lt;/sup&gt;)Co&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;(NAd)](OTf)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;). Despite a half-life of less than 1&#8197;h at room temperature, &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; could be isolated at low temperatures in analytically pure form. Single-crystal X-ray diffractometry and EPR spectroscopy corroborate the molecular structure and the d&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; low-spin, S=
, electron configuration. A computational analysis of &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; suggests high covalency within the Co&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;=NAd bond with non-negligible spin density located at the imido moiety, which translates into substantial triplet nitrene character.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Aglacins&#8197;A, B, and E</title>

         <dc:description>
An asymmetric photoenolization/Diels&#8211;Alder (APEDA) reaction was developed for the asymmetric total synthesis of the aryltetralin cyclic ether lignans aglacins&#8197;A, B, and E (see scheme) and enabled revision of the absolute configuration of these natural products. The strategy was also used to synthesize the aryldihydronaphthalene&#8208;type lignans (&#8722;)&#8208;7,8&#8208;dihydroisojusticidin&#8197;B and (+)&#8208;linoxepin and to build a small library of lignans (27 members).







Abstract
An asymmetric photoenolization/Diels&#8211;Alder (PEDA) reaction between electron&#8208;rich 2&#8208;methylbenzaldehydes and unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactones was developed to directly construct the basic tricyclic core of aryltetralin lactone lignans. This methodology enabled the first asymmetric total synthesis of aglacins&#8197;A, B, and E and revision of the absolute configuration of these natural lignans. The strategy was also used to prepare the naturally occurring aryldihydronaphthalene&#8208;type lignans (&#8722;)&#8208;7,8&#8208;dihydroisojusticidin&#8197;B and (+)&#8208;linoxepin in four and six steps, as well as 27 natural&#8208;product&#8208;like molecules containing a C8&#8242; quaternary center. We believe that the synthetic aglacins and small&#8208;molecule library provide new opportunities to carry out the SAR studies of the podophyllotoxin family of natural products.

         <title>Cationic Heterobimetallic Mg(Zn)/Al(Ga) Combinations for Cooperative C&#8211;F Bond Cleavage</title>

Together strong: Electron&#8208;rich low&#8208;valent AlI and electron&#8208;poor Zn2+ centers cooperatively cleave the unactivated, strong C&#8722;F bond in fluorobenzene via a dearomatization&#8211;rearomatization mechanism.







Abstract
Low&#8208;valent (MeBDI)Al and (MeBDI)Ga and highly Lewis acidic cations in [(tBuBDI)M+&#8901;C6H6][(B(C6F5)4&#8722;] (M=Mg or Zn, MeBDI=HC[C(Me)N&#8208;DIPP]2, tBuBDI=HC[C(tBu)N&#8208;DIPP]2, DIPP=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) react to heterobimetallic cations [(tBuBDI)Mg&#8211;Al(MeBDI)+], [(tBuBDI)Mg&#8211;Ga(MeBDI)+] and [(tBuBDI)Zn&#8211;Ga(MeBDI)+]. These cations feature long Mg&#8211;Al (or Ga) bonds while the Zn&#8211;Ga bond is short. The [(tBuBDI)Zn&#8211;Al(MeBDI)+] cation was not formed. Combined AIM and charge calculations suggest that the metal&#8211;metal bonds to Zn are considerably more covalent, whereas those to Mg should be described as weak AlI(or GaI)&#8594;Mg2+ donor bonds. Failure to isolate the Zn&#8211;Al combination originates from cleavage of the C&#8722;F bond in the solvent fluorobenzene to give (tBuBDI)ZnPh and (MeBDI)AlF+ which is extremely Lewis acidic and was not observed, but (MeBDI)Al(F)&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;F)&#8208;(F)Al(MeBDI)+ was verified by X&#8208;ray diffraction. DFT calculations show that the remarkably facile C&#8211;F bond cleavage follows a dearomatization/rearomatization route.

The self&#8208;assembly of a new family of triple&#8208;stranded helicates with fascinating chiral characteristics from axially chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;type ligands are reported. The fine&#8208;tuning of chiral microenvironments within the well&#8208;defined complexes has enabled outstanding chiral discrimination properties, leading to highly enantio&#8208; and helix&#8208;sense&#8208;selective recognition for chiral amino alcohols (up to 9.35).







Abstract
Here we report the formation of an unexpected and unique family of chiral helicates. Crystal structures show that these triple&#8208;stranded ZnII2L3 complexes are held together by subcomponent assembly of axially chiral diamine&#8208;functionalized 1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenol ditopic with 2&#8208;formylpyridine and ZnII. Specifically, the molecular helicity of the complexes can be controlled by the absolute configurations of the bimetallic vertices, which has been shown to be homoconfiguration (&#916;&#916;) or mesomeric configuration (&#916;&#923;), depending critically on the bulky groups and length of the spacers. Fascinatingly, in this system we can engineer the space&#8208;restricted chiral microenvironments with varied polar and apolar moieties, which profoundly influence the binding affinities and chiral discrimination properties of the helicates, leading to highly enantio&#8208; and helix&#8208;sense&#8208;selective recognition for chiral amino alcohols (up to 9.35). This work reveals the transformation of single&#8208;molecule chirality to global supramolecular chirality within well&#8208;defined helicates and demonstrates that their chiral discrimination are highly dependent on the superior microenvironments.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Second Time&#8208;Resolved Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy Reveals Dynamic CO Intermediates during Electrochemical CO2 Reduction on Copper</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 30, Page 16576-16584, July 19, 2021. </description>

Time&#8208;resolved surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TR&#8208;SERS) reveals the dynamics of the CO2 reduction reaction over Cu surfaces with a sub&#8208;second time resolution of 717&#8197;ms per spectrum. Anodic treatment and subsequent reduction result in a highly active surface for both SERS and ethylene production within 7&#8197;s. A dynamic CO intermediate below 2060&#8197;cm&#8722;1 correlates with CO&#8208;CO coupling and ethylene formation, and a static CO intermediate with a vibration at 2092&#8197;cm&#8722;1 relates to CO production.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CO2RR) into hydrocarbons is a promising approach for greenhouse gas mitigation, but many details of this dynamic reaction remain elusive. Here, time&#8208;resolved surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TR&#8208;SERS) is employed to successfully monitor the dynamics of CO2RR intermediates and Cu surfaces with sub&#8208;second time resolution. Anodic treatment at 1.55&#8197;V vs. RHE and subsequent surface oxide reduction (below &#8722;0.4&#8197;V vs. RHE) induced roughening of the Cu electrode surface, which resulted in hotspots for TR&#8208;SERS, enhanced time resolution (down to &#8776;0.7&#8197;s) and fourfold improved CO2RR efficiency toward ethylene. With TR&#8208;SERS, the initial restructuring of the Cu surface was followed (&lt;7&#8197;s), after which a stable surface surrounded by increased local alkalinity was formed. Our measurements revealed that a highly dynamic CO intermediate, with a characteristic vibration below 2060&#8197;cm&#8722;1, is related to C&#8722;C coupling and ethylene production (&#8722;0.9&#8197;V vs. RHE), whereas lower cathodic bias (&#8722;0.7&#8197;V vs. RHE) resulted in gaseous CO production from isolated and static CO surface species with a distinct vibration at 2092&#8197;cm&#8722;1.

     alt="Sub-Second Time-Resolved Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy Reveals Dynamic CO Intermediates during Electrochemical CO2 Reduction on Copper"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time-resolved surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TR-SERS) reveals the dynamics of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction over Cu surfaces with a sub-second time resolution of 717&#8197;ms per spectrum. Anodic treatment and subsequent reduction result in a highly active surface for both SERS and ethylene production within 7&#8197;s. A dynamic CO intermediate below 2060&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; correlates with CO-CO coupling and ethylene formation, and a static CO intermediate with a vibration at 2092&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; relates to CO production.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) into hydrocarbons is a promising approach for greenhouse gas mitigation, but many details of this dynamic reaction remain elusive. Here, time-resolved surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TR-SERS) is employed to successfully monitor the dynamics of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR intermediates and Cu surfaces with sub-second time resolution. Anodic treatment at 1.55&#8197;V vs. RHE and subsequent surface oxide reduction (below &#8722;0.4&#8197;V vs. RHE) induced roughening of the Cu electrode surface, which resulted in hotspots for TR-SERS, enhanced time resolution (down to &#8776;0.7&#8197;s) and fourfold improved CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR efficiency toward ethylene. With TR-SERS, the initial restructuring of the Cu surface was followed (&amp;lt;7&#8197;s), after which a stable surface surrounded by increased local alkalinity was formed. Our measurements revealed that a highly dynamic CO intermediate, with a characteristic vibration below 2060&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, is related to C&#8722;C coupling and ethylene production (&#8722;0.9&#8197;V vs. RHE), whereas lower cathodic bias (&#8722;0.7&#8197;V vs. RHE) resulted in gaseous CO production from isolated and static CO surface species with a distinct vibration at 2092&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Combining junction enhanced Raman and conductance spectroscopies provides a novel approach for studying chemical systems at the single molecule level. In their Research Article on page&#8197;16436, Joshua Hihath&#160;et&#8197;al.&#160;show that by simultaneously measuring the transport properties and the Raman response of a single molecule it is possible to extract multidimensional information about the junction's mechanical, electrical, and optical properties to understand the role of structural dynamics on molecular charge transport.

In their Research Article on &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202100886"&gt;page&#8197;16436&lt;/a&gt;, Joshua Hihath&#160;et&#8197;al.&#160;show that by simultaneously measuring the transport properties and the Raman response of a single molecule it is possible to extract multidimensional information about the junction's mechanical, electrical, and optical properties to understand the role of structural dynamics on molecular charge transport.

Direct conversion of the greenhouse gas CO2&#160;into value&#8208;added compounds remains a major challenge. Simultaneous one&#8208;pot coupling of a synthetic CO2&#8208;fixing cycle with a natural glyoxylate assimilation module and different natural product biosynthetic pathways enables the production of valuable terpenes and polyketides directly from CO2. Demonstration of this modular in vitro platform sets the stage for harnessing the greenhouse gas CO2&#160;as source for the sustainable synthesis of multi&#8208;carbon compounds, as reported by Tobias&#8197;J. Erb et&#8197;al. in their Communication on page&#8197;16420.

Molecular&#8208;rotor&#8208;driven advanced porous materials (MR&#8208;APMs) can expand the chemical and physical properties of conventional rigid porous solids and drive the development of sophisticated stimuli&#8208;responsive materials. This Minireview emphasizes the strategies for the localization and characterization of molecular rotors in porous materials as well as the exploration of their rotor&#8208;induced specific functionalities.







Abstract
Advanced porous materials (APMs)&#8212;such as metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and porous organic polymers (POPs)&#8212;have emerged as an exciting research frontier of chemistry and materials science. Given their tunable pore size and extensive diversity, APMs have found widespread applications. In addition, adding dynamic functional groups to porous solids furthers the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive materials. By incorporating moving elements&#8212;molecular rotors&#8212;into the porous frameworks, molecular&#8208;rotor&#8208;driven advanced porous materials (MR&#8208;APMs) can respond reversibly to chemical and physical stimuli, thus imparting dynamic functionalities that have not been found in conventional porous materials. This Minireview discusses exemplary MR&#8208;APMs in terms of their design, synthesis, rotor dynamics, and potential applications.

Fluorescence imaging in the NIR&#8208;II window has become a powerful method for biomedical research owing the combined merits of diminished background fluorescence and deep tissue penetration. NIR&#8208;II fluorophores occupy a central position in this technology. This review discusses the strategies applied in the design of NIR&#8208;II fluorophores and NIR&#8208;II fluorescent probes.







Abstract
The development of fluorophores for the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) represents an emerging, significant, and vibrant field in analytic chemistry, chemical biology, and biomedical engineering. The wavelength, brightness, and stability are three crucial factors that determine the performance of an NIR&#8208;II fluorophore. Up to now, significant progress has been made in the development of NIR&#8208;II fluorescence molecular probes, including the synthesis of D&#8208;A&#8208;D and D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A fluorophores with improved NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging performance and the construction of off&#8211;on probes and ratiometric probes via energy transfer or molecular structure modification. In this review, we summarize the most recent advances in molecular engineering design strategies of NIR&#8208;II fluorophores and probes, then highlight a selection of bioimaging and biosensing applications. We also provide perspectives on potential challenges and opportunities in this emerging field

         <title>Photocatalysis Enhanced by External Fields</title>

External fields, including microwaves, mechanical stress, temperature gradient, external electric field, magnetic field, and coupled multiple fields, provide an effective and facile strategy to enhance the photocatalytic performance of semiconductors.







Abstract
The efficient conversion of solar energy by means of photocatalysis shows huge potential to relieve the ongoing energy crisis and increasing environmental pollution. However, unsatisfactory conversion efficiency still hinders its practical application. The introduction of external fields can remarkably enhance the photocatalytic performance of semiconductors from the inside out. This review focuses on recent advances in the application of diverse external fields, including microwaves, mechanical stress, temperature gradient, electric field, magnetic field, and coupled fields, to boost photocatalytic reactions, for applications in, for example, contaminant degradation, water splitting, CO2 reduction, and bacterial inactivation. The relevant reinforcement mechanisms of photoabsorption, the transport and separation of photoinduced charges, and adsorption of reagents by the external fields are highlighted. Finally, the challenges and outlook for the development of external&#8208;field&#8208;enhanced photocatalysis are presented.

         <title>Doubling the Stakes: The Promise of Halide Double Perovskites</title>

Two B sites in combination dictate the properties of halide double perovskites (A2BB&#8242;X6; A=monocation, X=halide). This Minireview gives a brief overview of the rich history of halide double perovskites, highlights key structural and electronic aspects, and describes the current understanding on how to correctly select the B&#8208;site pairs that afford the desired properties.







Abstract
When the stakes are doubled in a wager, a player must correctly place two consecutive bets to win, but the payout is larger. Similarly, two B sites in combination dictate the properties of A2BB&#8242;X6 (A=monocation, X=halide) double perovskites. Correctly picking two B sites is more challenging than picking just one, as in the AIBIIX3 single perovskites, but the options are greater and, we believe, the rewards are higher when the stakes are doubled. In this Minireview, we emphasize fundamental aspects of halide double perovskites to provide a foundation for interested readers to explore this extraordinary class of materials. In particular, we highlight the differences and similarities between double and single perovskites and describe how the double perovskite structure potentially offers greater control over photophysical properties.

         <title>Interfacial Microenvironment Modulation Boosting Electron Transfer between Metal Nanoparticles and MOFs for Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 30, Page 16372-16376, July 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt co&#8208;catalysts with modulated microenvironments, including polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) capped Pt nanoparticles (denoted as PtPVP), Pt with partially removed PVP (PtrPVP), and clean Pt without PVP (Pt), are encapsulated in a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). Systemic investigations suggest that the PVP presents negative influence on the interfacial electron transfer between Pt and the MOF, and the PVP removal greatly boosts photocatalysis.







Abstract
Interfacial electron transfer between cocatalyst and photosensitizer is key in heterogeneous photocatalysis, yet the underlying mechanism remains subtle and unclear. Surfactant coated on the metal cocatalysts, greatly modulating the microenvironment of catalytic sites, is largely ignored. Herein, a series of Pt co&#8208;catalysts with modulated microenvironments, including polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) capped Pt nanoparticles (denoted as PtPVP), Pt with partially removed PVP (PtrPVP), and clean Pt without PVP (Pt), were encapsulated into a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, to afford PtPVP@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, PtrPVP@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, and Pt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, respectively, for photocatalytic hydrogen production. The PVP appears to have a negative influence on the interfacial electron transfer between Pt and the MOF. Compared with PtPVP@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, the removal of interfacial PVP improves the sluggish kinetics of electron transfer, boosting photocatalytic hydrogen production.

We report the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of red/green/blue solid&#8208;state bandgap fluorescent carbon quantum rings (R/G/B&#8208;SBF&#8208;CQRs) with high quantum yields up to 30&#8211;46&#8201;% for high&#8208;performance warm&#8208;white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diodes.







Abstract
The negative impact of rare&#8208;earth elements (REEs) on the environment, limited supply and high cost prompt the need for REE&#8208;free phosphor&#8208;converted white light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). Here, we report the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of red/green/blue solid&#8208;state bandgap fluorescent carbon quantum rings (R/G/B&#8208;SBF&#8208;CQRs) with high quantum yields up to 30&#8211;46&#8201;%. This was achieved using cyano&#8208;group&#8208;bearing p&#8208;phenyldiacetonitrile as precursor and forming carbon quantum rings of different diameters through the linkage of curved carbon quantum ribbons of different lengths. The results show the role of cyano groups in inducing the curvature of the carbon quantum ribbons for CQR formation and emission of stable solid&#8208;state bandgap fluorescence. R/G/B&#8208;SBF&#8208;CQRs&#8208;phosphor&#8208;based LEDs emitted warm white light with low CCT (3576&#8197;K), high CRI (96.6), and high luminous efficiency (48.7&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1), comparable to REE&#8208;phosphor&#8208;based LEDs.

         <title>Synthesis of Fluorinated Aminoalkylboronic Acids from Amphoteric &#945;&#8208;Boryl Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 30, Page 16366-16371, July 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the prevalence of boron&#8208;based therapeutics and inhibitors there is a dearth of methods to modulate oxidative stability of boronic acids. The introduction of fluorine atoms is known to increase oxidative stability of organic molecules, but fluoroalkyl groups connected to boron are unstable. Here we show that fluorinated aminoalkylboronic acids are stable within a wide range of pH values, along with evidence of cyclic and linear conformers at basic pH.







Abstract
Our ongoing search for underdeveloped functional group combinations has brought to light &#945;&#8208;fluorinated aminoalkylboronic acids, a new class of molecules featuring the B&#8208;CF linkage. These compounds can now be generated from secondary amines and &#945;&#8208;boryl aldehydes through electrophilic fluorination of boryl enamines or enamides. Fluorinated &#946;&#8208;aminoalkylboronic acids show no signs of degradation under ambient conditions. We present evidence for the involvement of chair&#8208;like motifs, favored over the acyclic forms by up to 1.7&#177;0.1&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 in water and held together by an amine&#8208;boronate hydrogen bond. Fluorinated &#946;&#8208;aminoalkylboronic acids are stable over a wide pH range and are characterized by a pKa of 3.4, which is the lowest of any alkylboronic acid.

Round bottom jar&#8208;like silica nanostructure (SiJAR) fitted with a Mn&#8208;silicate lid was fabricated through the highly controlled thermal solid&#8208;state conversion of a MnO nanocrystal at the inside of hollow SiO2 shell. The lid aperture&#8208;opening created an open&#8208;mouth nanoreactor accommodating catalytic metal nanocrystals and enzymes, which performed asymmetric aldol reactions with high activity and enantioselectivity inside living cells.







Abstract
Nanodevices, harvesting the power of synthetic catalysts and enzymes to perform enantioselective synthesis inside cell, have never been reported. Here, we synthesized round bottom jar&#8208;like silica nanostructures (SiJARs) with a chemo&#8208;responsive metal&#8208;silicate lid. This was isolated as an intermediate structure during highly controlled solid&#8208;state nanocrystal&#8208;conversion at the arc&#8208;section of silica shell. Different catalytic noble metals (Pt, Pd, Ru) were selectively modified on the lid&#8208;section through galvanic reactions. And, lid aperture&#8208;opening was regulated by mild acidic conditions or intracellular environment which accommodated the metal nanocrystals and enzymes, and in turn created an open&#8208;mouth nanoreactor. Distinct from the free enzymes, SiJARs performed asymmetric aldol reactions with high activity and enantioselectivity (yield &gt;99&#8201;%, ee=95&#8201;%) and also functioned as the artificial catalytic organelles inside living cells. This work bridges the enormous potential of sophisticated nanocrystal&#8208;conversion chemistry and advanced platforms for new&#8208;to&#8208;nature catalysis.

         <title>Understanding Ligand&#8208;Directed Heterogeneous Catalysis: When the Dynamically Changing Nature of the Ligand Layer Controls the Hydrogenation Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 30, Page 16349-16354, July 19, 2021. </description>

We present a mechanistic study on the formation and dynamic changes of a ligand&#8208;based heterogeneous Pd catalyst for chemoselective hydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehyde acrolein. Deposition of allyl cyanide as a precursor of a ligand layer renders Pd highly active and close to 100&#8201;% selective toward propenol formation by promoting acrolein adsorption in a desired configuration via the C=O end.

We present a mechanistic study on the formation and dynamic changes of a ligand&#8208;based heterogeneous Pd catalyst for chemoselective hydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehyde acrolein. Deposition of allyl cyanide as a precursor of a ligand layer renders Pd highly active and close to 100&#8201;% selective toward propenol formation by promoting acrolein adsorption in a desired configuration via the C=O end. Employing a combination of real&#8208;space microscopic and in&#8208;operando spectroscopic surface&#8208;sensitive techniques, we show that an ordered active ligand layer is formed under operational conditions, consisting of stable N&#8208;butylimine species. In a competing process, unstable amine species evolve on the surface, which desorb in the course of the reaction. Obtained atomistic&#8208;level insights into the formation and dynamic evolution of the active ligand layer under operational conditions provide important input required for controlling chemoselectivity by purposeful surface functionalization.

PdII&#8208;catalyzed &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8211;H carbonylation of free carboxylic acids, a new method for the synthesis of a wide range of cyclic anhydrides, is reported. Decarboxylative functionalization of the installed carboxyl group provides access to diverse &#946;&#8208;functionalized aliphatic acids. The enantioselective C&#8211;H carbonylation of cyclopropanecarboxylic acids is also achieved.







Abstract
The development of C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalizations of free carboxylic acids has provided a wide range of versatile C&#8722;C and C&#8722;Y (Y=heteroatom) bond&#8208;forming reactions. Additionally, C&#8211;H functionalizations have lent themselves to the one&#8208;step preparation of a number of valuable synthetic motifs that are often difficult to prepare through conventional methods. Herein, we report a &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8211;H carbonylation of free carboxylic acids using Mo(CO)6 as a convenient solid CO source and enabled by a bidentate ligand, leading to convenient syntheses of cyclic anhydrides. Among these, the succinic anhydride products are versatile stepping stones for the mono&#8208;selective introduction of various functional groups at the &#946; position of the parent acids by decarboxylative functionalizations, thus providing a divergent strategy to synthesize a myriad of carboxylic acids inaccessible by previous &#946;&#8208;C&#8211;H activation reactions. The enantioselective carbonylation of free cyclopropanecarboxylic acids has also been achieved using a chiral bidentate thioether ligand

         <title>Electrical Loss Management by Molecularly Manipulating Dopant&#8208;free Poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) towards 16.93&#8201;% CsPbI2Br Solar Cells</title>

An electrical loss management strategy by using SMe&#8208;TATPyr molecule manipulating dopant&#8208;free Poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) (P3HT) has been developed and employed to fabricate efficient and thermally stable CsPbI2Br solar cells. The P3HT/SMe&#8208;TATPyr presents optimized molecular orientation, favorable energy level alignment and effective defect passivation. Based on P3HT/SMe&#8208;TATPyr HTLs, the fabricated devices yield a record&#8208;high efficiency of 16.93&#8201;% for CsPbI2Br solar cells with dopant&#8208;free HTLs.







Abstract
Inorganic cesium lead halide perovskites offer a pathway towards thermally stable photovoltaics. However, moisture&#8208;induced phase degradation restricts the application of hole transport layers (HTLs) with hygroscopic dopants. Dopant&#8208;free HTLs fail to realize efficient photovoltaics due to severe electrical loss. Herein, we developed an electrical loss management strategy by manipulating poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) with a small molecule, i.e., SMe&#8208;TATPyr. The developed P3HT/SMe&#8208;TATPyr HTL shows a three&#8208;time increase of carrier mobility owing to breaking the long&#8208;range ordering of &#8220;edge&#8208;on&#8221; P3HT and inducing the formation of &#8220;face&#8208;on&#8221; clusters, over 50&#8201;% decrease of the perovskite surface defect density, and a reduced voltage loss at the perovskite/HTL interface because of favorable energy level alignment. The CsPbI2Br perovskite solar cell demonstrates a record&#8208;high efficiency of 16.93&#8201;% for dopant&#8208;free HTL, and superior moisture and thermal stability by maintaining 96&#8201;% efficiency at low&#8208;humidity condition (10&#8211;25&#8201;% R. H.) for 1500&#8197;hours and over 95&#8201;% efficiency after annealing at 85&#8201;&#176;C for 1000&#8197;hours.

         <title>Enhanced Electrochemical Performance of Aprotic Li&#8208;CO2 Batteries with a Ruthenium&#8208;Complex&#8208;Based Mobile Catalyst</title>

Ru(bpy)3Cl2 was applied as the first ruthenium&#8208;based mobile catalyst to enhance the electrochemical performance of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. The RuII catalyst was discovered to interact with both CO2 molecules and amorphous Li2C2O4 intermediate, thus promoting CO2RR and delaying carbonate formation and consequently leading to lowered overpotential, enlarged capacity, and prolonged cyclability of the batteries.







Abstract
Li&#8208;CO2 batteries are regarded as next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density electrochemical devices. However, the greatest challenge arises from the formation of the discharge product, Li2CO3, which would accumulate and deactivate heterogenous catalysts to cause huge polarization. Herein, Ru(bpy)3Cl2 was employed as a solution&#8208;phase catalyst for Li&#8208;CO2 batteries and proved to be the most effective one screened so far. Spectroscopy and electrochemical analyses elucidate that the RuII center could interact with both CO2 and amorphous Li2C2O4 intermediate, thus promoting electroreduction process and delaying carbonate transformation. As a result, the charge potential is reduced to 3.86&#8197;V and over 60 discharge/charge cycles are achieved with a fixed capacity of 1000&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 300&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. Our work provides a new avenue to improve the electrochemical performance of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries with efficient mobile catalysts.

         <title>A Fully Coplanar Donor&#8211;Acceptor Polymeric Semiconductor with Promoted Charge Separation Kinetics for Photochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 30, Page 16355-16359, July 19, 2021. </description>

Two polyarylether&#8208;based polymers with single/double linking patterns were investigated to establish the effect of the linking patterns on the charge generation and separation process in D&#8211;A conjugated polymer photocatalysts, thus achieving remarkable photocatalytic HER and HPER performances.







Abstract
Charge generation and separation are regarded as the major constraints limiting the photocatalytic activity of polymeric photocatalysts.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charge generation and separation are regarded as the major constraints limiting the photocatalytic activity of polymeric photocatalysts. Herein, two new linear polyarylether-based polymers (PAE&#8211;CPs) with distinct linking patterns between their donor and acceptor motifs were tailor-made to investigate the influence of different linking patterns on the charge generation and separation process. Theoretical and experimental results revealed that compared to the traditional single-stranded linker, the double-stranded linking pattern strengthens donor&#8211;acceptor interactions in PAE&#8211;CPs and generates a coplanar structure, facilitating charge generation and separation, and enabling red-shifted light absorption. With these prominent advantages, the PAE&#8211;CP interlinked with a double-stranded linker exhibits markedly enhanced photocatalytic activity compared to that of its single-strand-linked analogue. Such findings can facilitate the rational design and modification of organic semiconductors for charge-induced reactions.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Biphasic Electrolyte Inhibiting the Shuttle Effect of Redox Molecules in Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 30, Page 16360-16365, July 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biphasic electrolyte containing solvents with differing polarities, as well as lithium salts, was used to inhibit the shuttle effect of redox molecules. The cycling stability of lithium rechargeable batteries was substantially improved.







Abstract
Redox molecules (RMs) as electron carriers have been widely used in electrochemical energy&#8208;storage devices (ESDs), such as lithium redox flow batteries and lithium&#8208;O2 batteries. Unfortunately, migration of RMs to the lithium (Li) anode leads to side reactions, resulting in reduced coulombic efficiency and early cell death. Our proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study utilizes a biphasic organic electrolyte to resolve this issue, in which nonafluoro&#8208;1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrahydrohexyl&#8208;trimethoxysilane (NFTOS) and ether (or sulfone) with lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) can be separated to form the immiscible anolyte and catholyte. RMs are extracted to the catholyte due to the enormous solubility coefficients in the biphasic electrolytes with high and low polarity, resulting in inhibition of the shuttle effect. When coupled with a lithium anode, the Li&#8208;Li symmetric, Li redox flow and Li&#8208;O2 batteries can achieve considerably prolonged cycle life with biphasic electrolytes. This concept provides a promising strategy to suppress the shuttle effect of RMs in ESDs.

         <title>Photocatalytic Upgrading of Lignin Oil to Diesel Precursors and Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 30, Page 16399-16403, July 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lignin to diesel precursors route was achieved via solar driven coupling reaction over Au/CdS photocatalyst. The diesel precursors can be further hydrogenated to C16&#8211;C18 cyclic hydrocarbons or aromatics over Pd/C or CoMoS&#8208;P, respectively.







Abstract
Producing renewable biofuels from biomass is a promising way to meet future energy demand. Here, we demonstrated a lignin to diesel route via dimerization of the lignin oil followed by hydrodeoxygenation. The lignin oil undergoes C&#8722;C bond dehydrogenative coupling over Au/CdS photocatalyst under visible light irradiation, co&#8208;generating diesel precursors and hydrogen. The Au nanoparticles loaded on CdS can effectively restrain the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, thus improving the efficiency of the dimerization reaction. About 2.4&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcatal&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 dimers and 1.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcatal&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 H2 were generated over Au/CdS, which is about 12 and 6.5 times over CdS, respectively. The diesel precursors are finally converted into C16&#8211;C18 cycloalkanes or aromatics via hydrodeoxygenation reaction using Pd/C or porous CoMoS catalyst, respectively. The conversion of pine sawdust to diesel was performed to demonstrate the feasibility of the lignin&#8208;to&#8208;diesel route.

         <title>The Synthesis of Hexaazatrinaphthylene&#8208;Based 2D Conjugated Copper Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Highly Selective and Stable Electroreduction of CO2 to Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 30, Page 16409-16415, July 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly crystalline hexaazatrinaphthylene&#8208;based 2D conjugated copper metal&#8208;organic framework was synthesized. With the synergic effect of hexaazatrinaphthylene and copper node, the resultant HATNA&#8208;Cu&#8208;MOF displays high selectivity and stability toward the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to methane.







Abstract
2D conjugated MOFs have attracted significant interests in recent years owing to their special structural features and promising physical and chemical properties. These intriguing attributes, to a large extent, stem from the nature of incorporated ligands. The available ligands for the construction of 2D conjugated MOFs are still limited, especially those that have heteroatoms included and exposed to the pores. In this work, we designed and synthesized a highly symmetric hexaazatrinaphthylene (HATNA)&#8208;based ligand with two different coordination sites. Through selective coordination, a highly crystalline and porous 2D conjugated copper metal&#8208;organic framework was constructed. Due to the synergic effects of HATNA and copper catecholate node, this HATNA&#8208;based 2D conjugated MOF can mediate the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to methane with high selectivity of 78&#8201;% at high current density of 8.2&#8197;milliamperes per square centimetre (mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) for long durability over 12&#8197;hours.

         <title>Low&#8208;Dimensional Inorganic Tin Perovskite Solar Cells Prepared by Templated Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 30, Page 16330-16336, July 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A templated growth approach, in which the crystallization of a 3D perovskite is guided by a dynamically dominant 2D structure, was established for the fabrication of a low&#8208;dimensional perovskite thin film with an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientation and a large grain size. The template growth is enabled by the reduced crystallization barrier of the 2D PEA2SnI4&#8722;xSCNx intermediate.







Abstract
The manipulation of the dimensionality and nanostructures based on the precise control of the crystal growth kinetics boosts the flourishing development of perovskite optoelectronic materials and devices. Herein, a low&#8208;dimensional inorganic tin halide perovskite, CsSnBrI2&#8722;x(SCN)x, with a mixed 2D and 3D structure is fabricated. A kinetic study indicates that Sn(SCN)2 and phenylethylamine hydroiodate can form a 2D perovskite structure that acts as a template for the growth of the 3D perovskite CsSnBrI2&#8722;x(SCN)x. The film shows an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientation and a large grain size, giving rise to reduced defect density, superior thermostability, and oxidation resistance. A solar cell based on this low&#8208;dimensional film reaches a power conversion efficiency of 5.01&#8201;%, which is the highest value for CsSnBrxI3&#8722;x perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, the device shows enhanced stability in ambient air.

         <title>A Modular In&#8197;Vitro Platform for the Production of Terpenes and Polyketides from CO2</title>

Coupling of a synthetic CO2&#8208;fixing cycle and a natural glyoxylate assimilation cycle with different biosynthetic pathways enables the sustainable production of terpenes and polyketides. Demonstration of this modular, multi&#8208;enzyme in&#8197;vitro platform sets the stage for a diversified synthesis of pharmaceuticals and commodity chemicals directly from CO2.







Abstract
A long&#8208;term goal in realizing a sustainable biocatalysis and organic synthesis is the direct use of the greenhouse gas CO2 as feedstock for the production of bulk and fine chemicals, such as pharmaceuticals, fragrances and food additives. Here we developed a modular in&#8197;vitro platform for the continuous conversion of CO2 into complex multi&#8208;carbon compounds, such as monoterpenes (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15) and polyketides. Combining natural and synthetic metabolic pathway modules, we established a route from CO2 into the key intermediates acetyl&#8208; and malonyl&#8208;CoA, which can be subsequently diversified through the action of different terpene and polyketide synthases. Our proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study demonstrates the simultaneous operation of different metabolic modules comprising of up to 29&#8197;enzymes in one pot, which paves the way for developing and optimizing synthesis routes for the generation of complex CO2&#8208;based chemicals in the future.

         <title>Colorimetric Metal&#8208;Free Detection of Carbon Monoxide: Reversible CO&#8197;Uptake by a BNB Frustrated Lewis Pair</title>

Acridan&#8208;derived receptors featuring an acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor functionalized cavity offer a metal&#8208;free approach for binding carbon monoxide. Reversibility can be tuned through borane Lewis acidity and the binding event signalled colorimetrically.







Abstract
We report two BNB&#8208;type frustrated Lewis pairs which feature an acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor functionalized cavity, and which differ in the nature of the B&#8208;bound fluoroaryl group (C6F5 vs. C6H3(CF3)2&#8208;3,5, Arf). These receptor systems are capable of capturing gaseous CO, and in the case of the &#8208;BArf2 system this can be shown to occur in reversible fashion at/above room temperature. For both systems, the binding event is accompanied by migration of one of the aryl substituents to the electrophilic carbon of the CO guest. Experiments utilizing an additional equivalent of PtBu3 allow the initially formed (non&#8208;migrated) CO adduct to be identified and trapped (via demethylation), while also establishing the reversibility of the B&#8208;to&#8208;C migration process. When partnered with the slightly less Lewis acidic &#8208;BArf2 substituent, this reversibility allows for release of the captured carbon monoxide in the temperature range 40&#8211;70&#8201;&#176;C, and the possibility for CO sensing, making use of the associated colourless to orange/red colour change.

         <title>Healable and Rearrangeable Networks of Liquid Crystal Elastomers Enabled by Diselenide Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 30, Page 16394-16398, July 19, 2021. </description>

A novel exchangeable diselenide chain extender is incorporated into an LCE system, bringing about the reprogrammability and the healability under visible&#8208;light irradiation or upon thermal treatment. These properties enable the utilization of a self&#8208;welding strategy to fabricate the complex LCE&#8208;based soft actuators without using any auxiliary reagent (adhesive, tape, catalysts or initiator).







Abstract
Based on liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) materials, hierarchically structured soft actuators can meet some requirements for &#8220;human&#8208;friendly&#8221; working mode and execute complex tasks with intelligent adaptation to environmental changes. However, few researchers have paid much attention to the preparation methods of multicomponent/hierarchical LCE actuators. In this communication, we demonstrate the successful integration of an exchangeable diselenide chain extender for the preparation of dynamic LCEs, which could be reprogrammed on heating or under visible light illumination. Moreover, the rearrangeable polydiselenide networks could be applied to develop the self&#8208;welding technology toward fabricating hierarchically structured LCE actuators with sophisticated deformability without using any auxiliary reagent (adhesive, tape, catalysts or initiator) during the assembling process.

         <title>Azacalix[3]triazines: A Substructure of Triazine&#8208;Based Graphitic Carbon Nitride Featuring Anion&#8208;&#960; Interactions</title>

Graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) has drawn considerable interest since the discovery of its metal&#8208;free photocatalytic properties. The synthesis of a substructure of triazine&#8208;based GCN (Tz&#8208;GCN), azacalix[3]triazines, is reported. The material exhibits super strong basicity as well as anion&#8208;&#960; interactions.







Abstract
Graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) has garnered broad research interest due to its unique catalytic properties. However, GCN, prepared by general methods, possesses myriad structural defects and it has been difficult to elucidate their intrinsic physical properties. We report the development of azacalix[3]triazines (AC3Ts), a substructure of triazine&#8208;based GCN (Tz&#8208;GCN). Despite the electron&#8208;deficient natures of triazine, AC3Ts capture protons as organic superbases. We reveal the unique anion&#8208;&#960; interactions of AC3Ts that alters the ionization potentials of AC3Ts. To the best of our knowledge, these features have not yet been recognized for Tz&#8208;GCN. These unveiled features of AC3Ts are expected to expand the usage scope and possibilities for GCNs.

         <dc:description>Structural changes at the active site of an enzyme induced by binding to a substrate molecule can result in enhanced activity in biological systems.

The resulting phase change affords exceptionally strong C2H2  binding that in turn enables highly selective C2H2  /C2H4  and C2H2/CO2  separation demonstrated by dynamic breakthrough experiments. sql&#8208;SIFSIX&#8208;bpe&#8208;Zn was observed to exhibit at least four phases: as&#8208;synthesised (&#945;); activated (&#946;); and C2H2  induced phases (&#946;' and &#947;). sql&#8208;SIFSIX&#8208;bpe&#8208;Zn&#8208;&#946; exhibited strong affinity for C2H2  at ambient conditions as demonstrated by benchmark isosteric heat of adsorption (  Q  st  ) of 67.5 kJ/mol validated through  in&#8208;situ  pressure gradient differential scanning calorimetry (PG&#8208;DSC). Further,  in&#8208;situ  characterisation and DFT calculations provided insight into the mechanism of the C2H2  induced fit transformation, binding positions and the nature of host&#8208;guest and guest&#8208;guest interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Fuel driven and enzyme regulated redox responsive supramolecular hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical reaction networks (CRN) embedded in hydrogels can transform responsive materials into complex self&#8211;regulating materials that generate feedback response to counter the effect of external stimuli. This study presents hydrogels containing the &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (CD) and ferrocene (Fc) host&#8208;guest pair as supramolecular crosslinks where redox responsive behavior is driven by the enzyme&#8208;fuel couples horse radish peroxidase (HRP)&#8208;H2O2 and glucose oxidase (GOx)&#8208;D&#8208;glucose. The hydrogel can be tuned from a responsive to a self&#8208;regulating supramolecular system by varying the concentration of added reduction fuel D&#8208;glucose. The onset of self&#8208;regulating behavior is due to formation of oxidation fuel in the hydrogel by a cofactor intermediate GOx[FADH2]. UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy, rheology and kinetic modelling were employed to understand the emergence of out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium behavior and reveal the programmable negative feedback response of the hydrogel, including the adaptation of its elastic modulus and its potential as a glucose sensor.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of M&#8208;NH2&#8208;NH2 Intermediate and Rate Determing Step for Nitrogen Reduction with Bioinspired Sulfur&#8208;bonded FeW Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The multimetallic sulfur&#8208;framework catalytic site of biological nitrogenases allows the efficient conversion of dinitrogen (N  2  ) to ammonia (NH  3  ) under ambient conditions. Inspired by biological nitrogenases, a bimetallic sulfide material (FeWS  x  @FeWO  4  ) was synthesized as a highly efficient N  2  reduction (NRR) catalyst by sulfur substitution of the surface of FeWO  4  nanoparticles. Thus prepared FeWS  x  @FeWO  4  catalysts exhibit a relatively high NH  3  production rate of 30.2 ug h  &#8722;1  mg  &#8722;1  cat  and a Faraday efficiency of 16.4% at  &#8722;  0.45 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode in a flow cell; these results have been confirmed via purified  15  N  2  &#8208;isotopic labeling experiments. In situ Raman spectra and hydrazine reduction kinetics analysis revealed that the reduction of undissociated hydrazine intermediates (M&#8208;NH  2  &#8208;NH  2  ) on the surface of the bimetallic sulfide catalyst is the rate&#8208;determing step for the NRR process. Therefore, this work can provide guidance for elucidating the structure&#8208;activity relationship of NRR catalysts.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A new family of carbon&#8208;bound boron enolates, generated by a kinetically controlled halogen exchange between chlorocatecholborane and silylketene acetals, is described. These C&#8208;boron enolates are demonstrated to activate 1,3&#8208;enyne substrates in the presence of a Pd(0)/Senphos ligand complex, resulting in the first examples of a carboboration reaction of an alkyne with enolate&#8208;equivalent nucleophiles. Highly substituted dienyl boron building blocks are produced in excellent site&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and diastereoselectivity by the described catalytic&#160;  cis  &#8208;carboboration reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Indolizy Carbene Ligand. Evaluation of Electronic Properties and Applications in Asymmetric Gold(I) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein a new family of carbene ligands based on an indolizine&#8208;ylidene (Indolizy) moiety. The corresponding gold(I) complexes are easily obtained from the gold(I)&#8208;promoted cyclization of allenylpyridine precursors. Evaluation of the electronic properties by experimental methods and also by DFT calculations confirm strong &#963;&#8208;donating and &#960;&#8208;accepting properties of these ligands. Cationization of the gold(I) complexes generates catalytic species that trigger diverse reactions of (poly)unsaturated precursors. When armed with a methylene phosphine oxide moiety on the stereogenic center adjacent to the nitrogen atom, the corresponding bifunctional carbene ligands give rise to highly enantioselective heterocyclizations. DFT calculations brought some rationalization and highlighted the critical roles played by the phosphine oxide group and the tosylate anion in the asymmetric cyclization of &#947;&#8208;allenols.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanically&#8208;triggered Hybridization Chain Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cells transmit piconewton forces to receptors to mediate processes such as migration and immune recognition. A major challenge in quantifying such forces is the sparsity of cell mechanical events. Accordingly, molecular tension is typically quantified with high resolution fluorescence microscopy, which hinders widespread adoption and application. Here, we report a mechanically&#8208;triggered hybridization chain reaction (mechano&#8208;HCR) that allows chemical amplification of mechanical events. The amplification is triggered when a cell receptor mechanically denatures a duplex revealing a cryptic initiator to activate the HCR reaction in situ. Importantly, mechano&#8208;HCR enables direct readout of pN forces using a plate reader. We leverage this capability and measured mechano&#8208;IC  50  for aspirin, Y&#8208;27632, and eptifibatide. Given that cell mechanical phenotypes are of clinical importance, mechano&#8208;HCR may offer a convenient route for drug discovery, personalized medicine, and disease diagnosis.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to and Reactivity of Fe0, Fe&#8722;I, FeI, and FeII PCcarbeneP Pincer Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report access to an Fe0 PCcarbeneP pincer complex that proceeds via an isolated &#945;&#8208;hydroxylalkyl hydrido complex. Reversible carbonyl migration to the carbene position is found to allow coordination chemistry and E&#8722;H bond addition (E=H, B, Cl) across the iron&#8211;carbene linkage, representing a unique mechanism for metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity. The PCcarbeneP pincer ligand is also found to stabilize formal FeII, FeI and Fe&#8722;I oxidation states.







Abstract
Despite their promising metal&#8211;ligand cooperative reactivity, PCcarbeneP pincer ligands are rarely reported for first&#8208;row transition&#8208;metal centres. Using a dehydration methodology, we report access to an Fe0 PCcarbeneP pincer complex (1) that proceeds via an isolated &#945;&#8208;hydroxylalkyl hydrido complex (3). Reversible carbonyl migration to the carbene position in 1 is found to allow coordination chemistry and E&#8722;H bond addition (E=H, B, Cl) across the iron&#8211;carbene linkage, representing a unique mechanism for metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity. The PCcarbeneP pincer ligand is also found to stabilize formal FeII, FeI, and Fe&#8722;I oxidation states, as demonstrated with synthesis and characterization of the complexes [11&#8208;X][BArF20] (X=Br, I), 12, and K[13]. Compound K[13] is found to be highly reactive, and abstracts hydrogen from a range of aliphatic C&#8722;H sources. Computational analysis by DFT suggests that the formal FeI and Fe&#8722;I complexes contain significant carbene radical character. The ability of the PCcarbeneP ligand scaffold to partake in metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity and to support a range of iron oxidation states renders it as potentially useful in many catalytic applications.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Directed Modification of Active Matrix Metalloproteases: Activity&#8208;based Probes with no Photolabile Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activity&#8208;based probes have been designed that react with matrix metalloproteases active sites without any external trigger. These phosphinic pseudo peptide probes displayed a preference for human matrix metalloelastase hMMP&#8208;12 and were capable of selectively labelling human and mouse MMP&#8208;12 in complex proteomes.







Abstract
Activity&#8208;based probes enable discrimination between the active enzyme and its inactive or inactivated counterparts. Since metalloproteases catalysis is non&#8208;covalent, activity&#8208;based probes targeting them have been systematically developed by decorating reversible inhibitors with photo&#8208;crosslinkers. By exploiting two types of ligand&#8208;guided chemistry, we identified novel activity&#8208;based probes capable of covalently modifying the active site of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) without any external trigger. The ability of these probes to label recombinant MMPs was validated in&#8197;vitro and the identity of the main labelling sites within their S3&#8242; region unambiguously assigned. We also demonstrated that our affinity probes can react with rhMMP12 at nanogram scale (that is, at 0.07&#8201;% (w/w)) in complex proteomes. Finally, this ligand&#8208;directed chemistry was successfully applied to label active MMP&#8208;12 secreted by eukaryote cells. We believe that this approach could be transferred more widely to many other metalloproteases, thus contributing to tackle their unresolved proteomic profiling in&#8197;vivo.

         <title>Solvated Nickel Complexes as Stoichiometric and Catalytic Perfluoroalkylation Agents**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Ligandless&#8221; nickel was found to be exceptionally capable of acting as a reservoir of fluoroalkyl anions or radicals. This property was exploited to fluoroalkylate organic substrates under stoichiometric and catalytic conditions.







Abstract
The acetonitrile&#8208;solvated [(MeCN)Ni(C2F5)3]&#8722; was prepared in order to compare and contrast its reactivity with the known [(MeCN)Ni(CF3)3]&#8722; towards organic electrophiles. Both [(MeCN)Ni(CF3)3]&#8722; and [(MeCN)Ni(C2F5)3]&#8722; successfully react with aryl iodonium and diazonium salts as well as alkynyl iodonium salts to give fluoroalkylated organic products. Electrochemical analysis of [(MeCN)NiII(C2F5)3]&#8722; suggests that, upon electro&#8208;oxidation to [(MeCN)nNiIII(C2F5)3], reductive homolysis of a perfluoroethyl radical occurs, with the concomitant formation of [(MeCN)2NiII(C2F5)2]. Catalytic C&#8722;H trifluoromethylations of electron&#8208;rich arenes were successfully achieved using either [(MeCN)Ni(CF3)3]&#8722; or the related [Ni(CF3)4]2&#8722;. Stoichiometric reactions of the solvated nickel complexes reveal that &#8220;ligandless&#8221; nickel is exceptionally capable of serving as reservoir of CF3 groups under catalytically relevant conditions.

         <title>A Family of Superhelicenes: Easily Tunable, Chiral Nanographenes by Merging Helicity with Planar &#960; Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the synthesis and in&#8208;depth physico&#8208;chemical characterization of a family of &#960;&#8208;extended helicenes that consist of HBCs fused via different five&#8208;membered rings. Despite being only a small part of the compounds, the nature of the five&#8208;membered rings has a huge impact on the properties of the whole molecule. We show the enantiomeric separation and circular dichroism properties together with X&#8208;ray analysis and charge transport calculations.







Abstract
We designed a straightforward synthetic route towards a full&#8208;fledged family of &#960;&#8208;extended helicenes: superhelicenes. They have two hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes (HBCs) in common that are connected via a central five&#8208;membered ring. By means of structurally altering this 5&#8208;membered ring, we realized a versatile library of molecular building blocks. Not only the superhelicene structure, but also their features are tuned with ease. In&#8208;depth physico&#8208;chemical characterizations served as a proof of concept thereof. The superhelicene enantiomers were separated, their circular dichroism was measured in preliminary studies and concluded with an enantiomeric assignment. Our work was rounded&#8208;off by crystal structure analyses. Mixed stacks of M&#8208; and P&#8208;isomers led to twisted molecular wires. Using such stacks, charge&#8208;carrier mobilities were calculated, giving reason to expect outstanding hole transporting properties.

         <title>A 3D Anionic Metal Covalent Organic Framework with soc Topology Built from Octahedral TiIV Complex for Photocatalytic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Octahedral TiIV complex was used to construct the first 3D anionic titanium&#8208;based COF (Ti&#8208;COF&#8208;1) with the edge transitive (6, 4)&#8208;connected soc topology. Ti&#8208;COF&#8208;1 shows high crystallinity, superior stability, abundant porosity, and high photocatalytic activity for Meerwein addition reactions. This research will extend to enrich the structure and functionality of 3D frameworks.







Abstract
The construction of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) remains challenging due to the limited types of organic building blocks. With octahedral TiIV complex as the building unit, this study reports on the first 3D anionic titanium&#8208;based COF (Ti&#8208;COF&#8208;1) with an edge&#8208;transitive (6, 4)&#8208;connected soc topology. Ti&#8208;COF&#8208;1 exhibits high crystallinity, superior stability, and large specific surface area (1000.4&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1). Moreover, Ti&#8208;COF&#8208;1 has a broad absorption band in the UV spectrum with an optical energy gap of 1.86&#8197;eV, and exhibits high photocatalytic activity toward Meerwein addition reactions. This research demonstrates an attractive strategy for the design of 3D functional COFs.

         <title>Supramolecular Cylinders Target Bulge Structures in the 5&#8242; UTR of the RNA Genome of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and Inhibit Viral Replication**

Viral untranslated regulatory regions (UTRs) contain a variety of conserved yet dynamic RNA structures crucial for viral replication. Combining in vitro RNA analysis with molecular dynamics simulations 3D models of the structure and dynamics of key regions of the 5&#8217; UTR of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 are created. Metallo&#8208;supramolecular helicates are shown to bind at a bulge and junction, and in cell assays confirm that they inhibit viral infection.







Abstract
The untranslated regions (UTRs) of viral genomes contain a variety of conserved yet dynamic structures crucial for viral replication, providing drug targets for the development of broad spectrum anti&#8208;virals. We combine in vitro RNA analysis with molecular dynamics simulations to build the first 3D models of the structure and dynamics of key regions of the 5&#8242; UTR of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genome. Furthermore, we determine the binding of metallo&#8208;supramolecular helicates (cylinders) to this RNA structure. These nano&#8208;size agents are uniquely able to thread through RNA junctions and we identify their binding to a 3&#8208;base bulge and the central cross 4&#8208;way junction located in stem loop 5. Finally, we show these RNA&#8208;binding cylinders suppress SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 replication, highlighting their potential as novel anti&#8208;viral agents.

         <title>Scalable Fabrication of Crystalline COF Membranes from Amorphous Polymeric Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A disorder&#8208;to&#8208;order transformation strategy is developed for the scalable fabrication of highly crystalline covalent organic framework (COF) membrane from amorphous polymeric membrane via monomer exchange.







Abstract
Covalent organic framework (COF) membranes hold potential for widespread applicability, but scalable fabrication is challenging. Here, we demonstrate the disorder&#8208;to&#8208;order transformation from amorphous polymeric membrane to crystalline COF membrane via monomer exchange. Solution processing is used to prepare amorphous membrane and the replacing monomer is selected based on the chemical and thermodynamical stability of the final framework. Reversible imine bonds allow the extraneous monomers to replace the pristine monomers within amorphous membrane, driving the transformation from disordered network to ordered framework. Incorporation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds enables the crystalline COF to imprint the amorphous membrane morphology. The COF membranes harvest proton conductivity up to 0.53&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C. Our strategy bridges amorphous polymeric and crystalline COF membranes for large&#8208;scale fabrication of COF membranes and affords guidance on materials processing.

         <title>A Light&#8208;Controllable Chemical Modulation of m6A RNA Methylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A route for the spatiotemporal control of intracellular RNA epigenetic modifications is presented. The agonism effect of a small compound can be concealed through appropriate photo&#8208;responsive caging groups, and the synthesized compounds exhibited a high sensitivity of external light irradiation and rapidly restored their effects in live cells.







Abstract
Bioactive small molecules with photo&#8208;removable protecting groups have provided spatial and temporal control of corresponding biological effects. We present the design, synthesis, computational and experimental evaluation of the first photo&#8208;activatable small&#8208;molecule methyltransferase agonist. By blocking the functional N&#8208;H group on MPCH with a photo&#8208;removable ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl moiety, we have developed a promising photo&#8208;caged compound that had completely concealed its biological activity. Short UV light exposure of cells treated with that caged molecule in a few minutes resulted in a considerable hypermethylation of m6A modification in transcriptome RNAs, implicating a rapid release of the parent active compound. This study validates for the first time the photo&#8208;activatable small organic molecular concept in the field of RNA epigenetic research, which represents a novel tool in spatiotemporal and cellular modulation approaches.

         <title>Ultrasmall Nanocapsules Obtained by Controlling Ostwald Ripening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ostwald ripening is used for reducing particle size in miniemulsions, providing a rapid and versatile method to synthesize silica nanocapsules with an ultrasmall size (ca. 6&#8197;nm) and a well&#8208;defined core&#8211;shell morphology, even at low surfactant concentration. Aqueous solubility of solvents and reactivity of alkoxysilanes used in the synthesis are the key factors in controlling the formation of ultrasmall nanocapsules.







Abstract
We describe here a method to synthesize ultrasmall nanocapsules with a diameter of 6&#8197;nm, exhibiting a well&#8208;defined core&#8211;shell morphology. Remarkably, the nanocapules are synthesized in a miniemulsion process without the need of large amounts of surfactant as commonly used in the microemulsion process. Ultrasmall nanocapsules with an oil core and a silica shell are formed by the concurrent processes of a sol&#8211;gel reaction and Ostwald ripening. Using solvents with different water solubilities and alkoxysilanes with different reactivities, we demonstrate that sizes of obtained nanocapsules depend on the ripening rate and alkoxysilane conversion rate. The method can be also used for encapsulating natural oils such as peppermint oil and limonene. This work shows that the Ostwald ripening phenomenon can be employed beneficially for the preparation of very small colloids.

         <title>Influence of Magnetic Fields on Electrochemical Reactions of Redox Cofactor Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches the underlying mechanism of magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;driven enhancement of Faradaic currents in solutions of redox cofactors, such as flavin mononucleotide, was investigated. The findings reveal that a magneto&#8208;hydrodynamic effect rather than radical pair mechanism is responsible for the observed current enhancement.







Abstract
Redox cofactors mediate many enzymatic processes and are increasingly employed in biomedical and energy applications. Exploring the influence of external magnetic fields on redox cofactor chemistry can enhance our understanding of magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;sensitive biological processes and allow the application of magnetic fields to modulate redox reactions involving cofactors. Through a combination of experiments and modeling, we investigate the influence of magnetic fields on electrochemical reactions in redox cofactor solutions. By employing flavin mononucleotide (FMN) cofactor as a model system, we characterize magnetically induced changes in Faradaic currents. We find that radical pair intermediates have negligible influence on current increases in FMN solution upon application of a magnetic field. The dominant mechanism underlying the observed current increases is the magneto&#8208;hydrodynamic effect. We extend our analyses to other diffusion&#8208;limited electrochemical reactions of redox cofactor solutions and arrive at similar conclusions, highlighting the opportunity to use this framework in redox cofactor chemistry.

         <title>Decatungstate&#8208;Mediated C(sp3)&#8211;H Heteroarylation via Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover in Batch and Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of decatungstate photocatalysis with oxidative radical&#8211;polar crossover is reported. This strategy enables the C(sp3)&#8211;H heteroarylation under mild conditions with excellent functional group tolerance. It was also adopted to enable late&#8208;stage functionalization of valuable compounds. Microflow technology reduced reaction times and boosted productivity of the transformation.







Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen atom transfer is a very powerful strategy for the regioselective C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization of organic molecules. Herein, we report on the unprecedented combination of decatungstate hydrogen atom transfer photocatalysis with the oxidative radical&#8211;polar crossover concept to access the direct net&#8208;oxidative C(sp3)&#8211;H heteroarylation. The present methodology demonstrates a high functional group tolerance (40 examples) and is scalable when using continuous&#8208;flow reactor technology. The developed protocol is also amenable to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of biologically relevant molecules such as stanozolol, (&#8722;)&#8208;ambroxide, podophyllotoxin, and dideoxyribose.

         <title>The Influence of a Changing Local Environment during Photoinduced CO2 Dissociation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Following individual molecules and their changing environment during photoinduced dissociation reveals the importance of local changes during a reaction on its efficiency. Two counteracting processes lead to a volcano&#8208;shaped reactivity.







Abstract
Though largely influencing the efficiency of a reaction, the molecular&#8208;scale details of the local environment of the reactants are experimentally inaccessible hindering an in&#8208;depth understanding of a catalyst's reactivity, a prerequisite to maximizing its efficiency. We introduce a method to follow individual molecules and their largely changing environment during a photochemical reaction. The method is illustrated for a rate&#8208;limiting step in a photolytic reaction, the dissociation of CO2 on two catalytically relevant surfaces, Ag(100) and Cu(111). We reveal with a single&#8208;molecule resolution how the reactant's surroundings evolve with progressing laser illumination and with it their propensity for dissociation. Counteracting processes lead to a volcano&#8208;like reactivity. Our unprecedented local view during a photoinduced reaction opens the avenue for understanding the influence of the products on reaction yields on the nanoscale.

         <title>Influence of Iron Sulfide Nanoparticle Sizes in Solid&#8208;State Batteries**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Particle&#8208;size reduction of iron sulfide nanoparticles improves its performance as an active material in solid&#8208;state conversion cathodes: For reduced particle dimensions, the electrochemical utilization of FeS2 is increased. The potential of FeS2 as an electrode in solid&#8208;state batteries is highlighted and the importance of the morphological design of battery materials is underscored.







Abstract
Given the inherent performance limitations of intercalation&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries, solid&#8208;state conversion batteries are promising systems for future energy storage. A high specific capacity and natural abundancy make iron disulfide (FeS2) a promising cathode&#8208;active material. In this work, FeS2 nanoparticles were prepared solvothermally. By adjusting the synthesis conditions, samples with average particle diameters between 10&#8197;nm and 35&#8197;nm were synthesized. The electrochemical performance was evaluated in solid&#8208;state cells with a Li&#8208;argyrodite solid electrolyte. While the reduction of FeS2 was found to be irreversible in the initial discharge, a stable cycling of the reduced species was observed subsequently. A positive effect of smaller particle dimensions on FeS2 utilization was identified, which can be attributed to a higher interfacial contact area and shortened diffusion pathways inside the FeS2 particles. These results highlight the general importance of morphological design to exploit the promising theoretical capacity of conversion electrodes in solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Combining High&#8208;Throughput Synthesis and High&#8208;Throughput Protein Crystallography for Accelerated Hit Identification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Parallel, automated, and practical multicomponent reaction synthesis of high diversity acrylamides/ester libraries and HT protein crystallography (PX) yielded potent covalent inhibitors of the main protease of the COVID&#8208;19 causing agent SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. More general, integration of HT PX and HT synthesis into the &#8220;design&#8208;make&#8208;test&#8208;analyze&#8221; cycle will open unprecedented horizons in medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
Protein crystallography (PX) is widely used to drive advanced stages of drug optimization or to discover medicinal chemistry starting points by fragment soaking. However, recent progress in PX could allow for a more integrated role into early drug discovery. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the interplay of high throughput synthesis and high throughput PX. We describe a practical multicomponent reaction approach to acrylamides and &#8208;esters from diverse building blocks suitable for mmol scale synthesis on 96&#8208;well format and on a high&#8208;throughput nanoscale format in a highly automated fashion. High&#8208;throughput PX of our libraries efficiently yielded potent covalent inhibitors of the main protease of the COVID&#8208;19 causing agent, SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Our results demonstrate, that the marriage of in situ HT synthesis of (covalent) libraires and HT PX has the potential to accelerate hit finding and to provide meaningful strategies for medicinal chemistry projects.

         <title>Coupling Aptamer&#8208;based Protein Tagging with Metabolic Glycan Labeling for In Situ Visualization and Biological Function Study of Exosomal Protein&#8208;Specific Glycosylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual labeling strategy for in situ visualization of exosomal protein&#8208;specific glycosylation based on a protein&#8208;specific aptamer tagging and metabolic glycan labeling (ExoAp&#8208;MGL) was used to study the presence and function of exosomal protein&#8208;specific glycosylation. Exosomal PD&#8208;L1 glycosylation is required for the interaction of exoPD&#8208;L1/PD&#8208;1 and inhibition of CD8+ T cell proliferation.







Abstract
Exosomal glycoproteins play important roles in many physiological and pathological functions. Herein, we developed a dual labeling strategy based on a protein&#8208;specific aptamer tagging and metabolic glycan labeling for visualizing glycosylation of specific proteins on exosomes. The glycosylation of exosomal PD&#8208;L1 (exoPD&#8208;L1) was imaged in situ using intramolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between fluorescent PD&#8208;L1 aptamers bound on exoPD&#8208;L1 and fluorescent tags on glycans introduced via metabolic glycan labeling. This method enables in situ visualization and biological function study of exosomal protein glycosylation. Exosomal PD&#8208;L1 glycosylation was confirmed to be required in interaction with PD&#8208;1 and participated in inhibiting of CD8+ T cell proliferation. This is an efficient and non&#8208;destructive method to study the presence and function of exosomal protein&#8208;specific glycosylation in situ, which provides a powerful tool for exosomal glycoproteomics research.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#916;G0 value of on&#8208;surface hydrogen binding was obtained from the chemical&#8208;shift change of the involved protons and the variation of acceptor concentrations via NMR. This reflects the ability of the catalyst surface to form hydrogen bonds with hydroxyl groups. The on&#8208;surface hydrogen&#8208;binding was successfully employed to drive the initiated activation of O&#8722;H bonds in probing the oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural with Co&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts.







Abstract
Hydrogen binding of molecules on solid surfaces is an attractive interaction that can be used as the driving force for bond activation, material&#8208;directed assembly, protein protection, etc. However, the lack of a quantitative characterization method for hydrogen bonds (HBs) on surfaces seriously limits its application. We measured the standard Gibbs free energy change (&#916;G0) of on&#8208;surface HBs using NMR. The HB&#8208;accepting ability of the surface was investigated by comparing &#916;G0 values employing the model biomass platform 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural on a series of Co&#8208;N&#8208;C&#8208;n catalysts with adjustable electron&#8208;rich nitrogen&#8208;doped contents. Decreasing &#916;G0 improves the HB&#8208;accepting ability of the nitrogen&#8208;doped surface and promotes the selectively initiated activation of O&#8722;H bonds in the oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural. As a result, the reaction kinetics is accelerated. In addition to the excellent catalytic performance, the turnover frequency (TOF) for this oxidation is much higher than for reported non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal catalysts.

         <title>A Versatile Silver(I) Pentafluorooxosulfate Reagent for the Synthesis of OSF5 Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of AgF with SOF4 in MeCN solution gives rise to solvated AgOSF5, which defines the starting point for a variety of other SF5O compounds. For example, transition metal salts are accessible by metathesis; furthermore, bipyridine&#8208;stabilised AgOSF5 has proven its general utility in the preparation of SF5O&#8208;substituted aromatics. The solid&#8208;state structure of the distorted octahedral [OSF5]&#8722; anion has been revealed by X&#8208;ray crystallography.







Abstract
Herein, we report the preparation of silver(I) pentafluorooxosulfate from commercially available AgF and OSF4. The compound is surprisingly stable in a MeCN solution. Apart from that, AgOSF5 has been stabilised by the addition of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine ligands. Starting from solutions of the unstabilised silver(I) salt, OSF5 complexes with NiII, CuI, and CuII&#8208;centres have been obtained. In addition, AgOSF5 has proven to be generally capable of mediating the transfer of OSF5 groups to aryne moieties, thus furnishing a new and safe method for the preparation of OSF5&#8208;substituted arenes. X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis of selected transition&#8208;metal OSF5 compounds have revealed distorted octahedral [OSF5]&#8722; anions which are extensively stabilised by hydrogen bonding.

         <title>25 Years of Reticular Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reticular chemistry translates the precision and expertise of organic and inorganic synthesis to the solid state. The most profound innovation of the field has been the elaboration of design strategies for the synthesis of extended crystalline solids through strong directional bonds. This Review highlights the classes of reticular materials, their functionalization, and the introduction of complexity into their backbones.







Abstract
At its core, reticular chemistry has translated the precision and expertise of organic and inorganic synthesis to the solid state. While initial excitement over metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) was undoubtedly fueled by their unprecedented porosity and surface areas, the most profound scientific innovation of the field has been the elaboration of design strategies for the synthesis of extended crystalline solids through strong directional bonds. In this contribution we highlight the different classes of reticular materials that have been developed, how these frameworks can be functionalized, and how complexity can be introduced into their backbones. Finally, we show how the structural control over these materials is being extended from the molecular scale to their crystal morphology and shape on the nanoscale, all the way to their shaping on the bulk scale.

         <title>Activating Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence of Organic Luminophores via External Heavy&#8208;Atom Effect and Rigidity of Ionic Polymer Matrix</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pure organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have attracted wide attention for their easy preparation, low toxicity, and applications in various fields like bioimaging and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Developing phosphorescent systems with more universality and less difficulty in synthesis has long been the pursuit of materials scientists. By employing polymeric quaternary ammonium salt with an ionic bonding matrix and heavy atoms, commercial fluorescent dyes are directly endowed with phosphorescence emission. In a single amorphous polymer, the external heavy&#8208;atom effect generates excited triplet states and the rigid polymer matrix stabilizes them. This study put forward a new general strategy to design and develop pure organic RTP materials starting from existing library of organic dyes without complicated chemical synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Liquid Droplet Formation and Facile Cytosolic Translocation of IgG in the Presence of Attenuated Cationic Amphiphilic Lytic Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fc region binding peptide conjugated with attenuated lytic peptide L17E trimer [FcB(L17E)3] was designed for intracellular delivery of IgG. Liquid droplets were formed by mixing Alexa Fluor 488 labeled IgG (Alexa488&#8208;IgG) with FcB(L17E)3. Droplet contact with cell membrane led to quick influx of Alexa488&#8208;IgG throughout cells. Successful delivery of functional proteins into cells allowed binding to subcellular targets in the presence of FcB(L17E)3.







Abstract
Fc region binding peptide conjugated with attenuated cationic amphiphilic lytic peptide L17E trimer [FcB(L17E)3] was designed for immunoglobulin G (IgG) delivery into cells. Particle&#8208;like liquid droplets were generated by mixing Alexa Fluor 488 labeled IgG (Alexa488&#8208;IgG) with FcB(L17E)3. Droplet contact with the cellular membrane led to spontaneous influx and distribution of Alexa488&#8208;IgG throughout cells in serum containing medium. Involvement of cellular machinery accompanied by actin polymerization and membrane ruffling was suggested for the translocation. Alexa488&#8208;IgG negative charges were crucial in liquid droplet formation with positively charged FcB(L17E)3. Binding of IgG to FcB(L17E)3 may not be necessary. Successful intracellular delivery of Alexa Fluor 594&#8208;labeled anti&#8208;nuclear pore complex antibody and anti&#8208;mCherry&#8208;nanobody tagged with supernegatively charged green fluorescence protein allowed binding to cellular targets in the presence of FcB(L17E)3.

         <title>Covalent Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Superlattice Covered with Organic Functional Group for Highly Sensitive and Selective Gas Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid superlattices (OIHSLs) hold attractive physical and chemical properties, while the construction of single&#8208;crystal covalent OIHSLs has not been achieved. Herein a coordination assembly strategy was proposed to create a single&#8208;crystal covalent OIHSL PbBDT (BDT=1,4&#8208;benzenedithiolate), where layered [PbS  2  ] sublattice covalently connects with benzene sublattice. The covalent bonding offers better thermo&#8208;/chemi&#8208;stability, inter&#8208;sublattice electron transport, and unique organic&#8208;group&#8208;functionalized surface, which may enable better performances in chemical applications than non&#8208;covalent OIHSL. These features endow PbBDT with the highest sensitivity, the lowest detection limit and excellent selectivity towards NO  2  at room temperature among all chemiresistive gas&#8208;sensing materials with reported response time less than 2 min without the need of light assistance.</dc:description>

         <title>Capture and Separation of SO2 Traces in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks via Pre&#8208;Synthetic Pore Environment Tailoring by Methyl Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pre&#8208;synthetic pore environment tailoring strategy has been applied to improve low&#8208;pressure SO2 affinity on stable isostructural methyl&#8208;functionalized MOFs by controlling methyl groups density. Enhanced low&#8208;pressure SO2 uptake and SO2 separation was achieved. This work provides a facile strategy to obtain tailor&#8208;made MOF adsorbents for challenging gas purification applications.







Abstract
Herein, we report a pre&#8208;synthetic pore environment design strategy to achieve stable methyl&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) for preferential SO2 binding and thus enhanced low (partial) pressure SO2 adsorption and SO2/CO2 separation. The enhanced sorption performance is for the first time attributed to an optimal pore size by increasing methyl group densities at the benzenedicarboxylate linker in [Ni2(BDC&#8208;X)2DABCO] (BDC&#8208;X=mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tetramethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate/terephthalate; DABCO=1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane). Monte Carlo simulations and first&#8208;principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate the key role of methyl groups within the pore surface on the preferential SO2 affinity over the parent MOF. The SO2 separation potential by methyl&#8208;functionalized MOFs has been validated by gas sorption isotherms, ideal adsorbed solution theory calculations, simulated and experimental breakthrough curves, and DFT calculations.

         <title>Selective Permeable Lithium&#8208;Ion Channels on Lithium Metal for Practical Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selectively permeable lithium&#8208;ion channels on lithium metal surface were created by aminopropyl&#8208;terminated polydimethylsiloxane anchored, which allow lithium ions to get through, while the polysulfides to be effectively blocked due to the much larger volume than lithium ions. The selective lithium ion channels enable a prolonged cycle life and a high Coulombic efficiency of 99&#8201;% in a practical Li&#8211;S pouch cell.







Abstract
Lithium metal batteries are considered a promising candidate for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy storage. However, the strong reducibility and high reactivity of lithium lead to low Coulombic efficiency when contacting oxidants, such as lithium polysulfide caused by the serious &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221; in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. Herein we design selectively permeable lithium&#8208;ion channels on lithium metal surface, which allow lithium ions to pass through by electrochemical overpotential, while the polysulfides are effectively blocked due to the much larger steric hindrance than lithium ions. The selective permeation of lithium ions through the channels is further elucidated by the molecular simulation and visualization experiment. Consequently, a prolonged cycle life of 75&#8197;cycles and high Coulombic efficiency of 99&#8201;% are achieved in a practical Li&#8211;S pouch cell with limited amounts of lithium and electrolyte, confirming the unique role the selective ion permeation plays in protecting highly reactive alkali metal anodes in working batteries.

         <title>Monitoring Solid&#8208;Phase Reactions in Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers by Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly reproducible, homogeneous plasmonic substrate was fabricated by electron&#8208;beam lithography to detect the Raman fingerprints of molecular self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) by surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) at all points of the substrate with high uniformity. This substrate was employed for characterizing the intermediates and the product of a solid&#8208;phase synthesis in a SAM by SERS.







Abstract
Nanopatterned surfaces enhance incident electromagnetic radiation and thereby enable the detection and characterization of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs), for instance in surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Herein, Au nanohole arrays, developed and characterized as SERS substrates, are exemplarily used for monitoring a solid&#8208;phase deprotection and a subsequent copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition &#8220;click&#8221; reaction, performed directly on the corresponding SAMs. The SERS substrate was found to be highly reliable in terms of signal reproducibility and chemical stability. Furthermore, the intermediates and the product of the solid&#8208;phase synthesis were identified by SERS. The spectra of the immobilized compounds showed minor differences compared to spectra of the microcrystalline solids. With its uniform SERS signals and the high chemical stability, the platform paves the way for monitoring molecular manipulations in surface functionalization applications.

         <title>Molecular Engineering on MoS2 Enables Large Interlayers and Unlocked Basal Planes for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aqueous Zn&#8208;storage behaviors of MoS2&#8208;based cathodes mainly rely on the ion&#8208;(de)intercalation at edge sites but are limited by the inactive basal plane. Herein, an in&#8208;situ molecular engineering strategy in terms of structure defects manufacturing and O&#8208;doping is proposed for MoS2 &#160;( designated as D&#8208;MoS2&#8208;O) to unlock the inert basal plane, expand the interlayer spacing (from 6.2 to 9.6 &#197;), and produce abundant 1T&#8208;phase. The tailored D&#8208;MoS2&#8208;O featuring excellent hydrophilicity and high conductivity allows the three&#8208;dimensional Zn2+ transport along both the  ab  plane and  c&#8208;axis, thus achieving the exceptional high&#8208;rate capability. The feasible Zn2+ diffusion through the basal plane is verified by density functional theory computations. As a proof of concept, the wearable quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state rechargeable Zn battery employing the D&#8208;MoS2&#8208;O cathode operates stably even under severe bending conditions, showing great application prospects. This work opens a new window for designing high&#8208;performance layered cathode materials for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

However, the drug development using the heterobifunctional PROTAC molecules is generally limited by poor membrane permeability, low in vivo efficacy and indiscriminate distribution. Herein an aptamer&#8208;PROTAC conjugation approach was developed as a novel strategy to improve the tumor&#8208;specific targeting ability and in vivo antitumor potency of conventional PROTACs. As proof of concept, the first aptamer&#8208;PROTAC conjugate (APC) was designed by conjugating a BET&#8208;targeting PROTAC to the nucleic acid aptamer AS1411 (AS) via a cleavable linker. Compared with the unmodified BET PROTAC, the designed molecule (APR) showed improved tumor targeting ability in a MCF&#8208;7 xenograft model, leading to enhanced in vivo BET degradation and antitumor potency and decreased toxicity. Thus, the APC strategy may pave the way for the design of tumor&#8208;specific targeting PROTACs and have broad applications in the development of PROTAC&#8208;based drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the occurrence of polysaccharides to the viral world: the case of Mimivirus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The general perception of viruses is that they are small in terms of size and genome, and that they hijack the host machinery to glycosylate their capsid. Giant viruses subvert all these concepts: their particles are not small, and their genome is more complex than that of some bacteria. Regarding glycosylation, this concept has been already challenged by the finding that Chloroviruses have an autonomous glycosylation machinery, that produces oligosaccharides similar in size to those of small viruses (6&#8208;12 units), albeit different in structure compared to the viral counterparts. We report herein that Mimivirus possesses a glycocalyx made of two different polysaccharides, now challenging the concept that all viruses coat their capsids with oligosaccharides of discrete size. This discovery contradicts the paradigm that such macromolecules are absent in viruses, blurring the boundaries between giant viruses and the cellular world and opening new avenues in the field of viral glycobiology.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Markovnikov Hydroxycarbonylation and Hydroalkoxycarbonylation of Vinyl Arenes: Synthesis of 2&#8208;Arylpropanoic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric hydroxycarbonylation is one of the most fundamental yet challenging methods for the synthesis of carboxylic acids. Herein, we reported the development of a palladium&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective Markovnikov hydroxycarbonylation of vinyl arenes with CO and water. A monodentate phosphoramidite ligand  L6  plays vital role in the reaction. The reaction tolerates a range of functional groups, and provides a facile and atom&#8208;economical approach to an array of 2&#8208;arylpropanoic acids including several commonly used non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs. The catalytic system has also enabled an asymmetric Markovnikov hydroalkoxycarbonylation of vinyl arenes with alcohols to afford 2&#8208;arylpropanates. Mechanistic investigations suggested that the reactions proceed through a palladium&#8208;hydride pathway, the hydropalladation is irreversible and is the regio&#8208; and enantiodetermining step, while hydrolysis/alcoholysis is probably the rate&#8208;limiting step.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An enantioselective consecutive cyclization/coupling process, catalyzed by palladium is reported. Stereoinduction arises from an enantioselective carbopalladation, generating a product which promotes a nucleopalladation step. The dual cyclization sequence was compatible with a variety of alkyne&#8208;tethered oxygen&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;centered nucleophiles, and a variety of alkenyl&#8208;tethered aryl iodides, to forge numerous bisheterocycles in good yields and high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Catalytic Highly Enantioselective 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In dynamic covalent chemistry, reactions follow a thermodynamically controlled pathway through equilibria. Reversible covalent bond formation and breaking in a dynamic process enables the interconversion of products formed under kinetic control to thermodynamically more stable isomers. Notably, enantioselective catalysis of dynamic transformations has not been reported and applied in complex molecule synthesis. We describe the discovery of dynamic covalent enantioselective metal complex&#8208;catalyzed 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions. We have developed a stereodivergent tandem synthesis of structurally and stereochemically complex molecules that sets eight stereocenters with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity through asymmetric reversible bond formation in a dynamic process in two consecutive Ag&#8208;catalyzed 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions of azomethine ylides with electron poor olefins. Time dependent reversible dynamic covalent bond formation gives enantiodivergent and diastereodivergent access to structurally complex double cycloadducts with high selectivity from a common set of reagents.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An efficient tandem catalysis method is achieved for the direct conversion of alcohol&#8208;containing alkynyl anilines to valuable chiral 2,3&#8208;fused tricyclic indoles. This method relies on a tandem indolization followed by enantioconvergent substitution of alcohols via borrowing hydrogen to construct two rings in one step, enabled by relay and cooperative catalysis of a chiral iridium complex with a chiral phosphoric acid. Highly diastereoselective transformations of the tricyclic indole products also provide efficient access to a diverse array of complex polycyclic indoline compounds.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The plant metabolite picrotoxinin (PXN) is a widely used tool in neuroscience for the identification of GABAergic signaling. Its hydrolysis in weakly alkaline media has been observed for over a century and the structure of the unstable hydrolysis intermediate was assigned by analogy to degradation product picrotoxic acid. Here we show this assignment to be in error and we revise the structure of the hydrolysis product by spectroscopic characterization  &#160;in situ  . Counterintuitively, hydrolysis occurs at a lactone that remains closed in the major isolable degradation product, which accounts for the longstanding mistake in the literature.</dc:description>

We demonstrated the DYKAT in the diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of spirooxindoles bearing furan&#8208;fused rings. The starting materials of the DYKAT, dihydrobenzofuranone derivatives, were synthesized in racemic diastereomer mixtures, and these were transformed to the spirooxindole derivatives in high yields with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities through Michael&#8208;Henry cascade reactions with nitrostyrenes under organocatalytic conditions. In the reactions, regardless the stereochemistry of the starting materials, all the four isomers were transformed to single diastereomers with high enantioselectivities, and four new chiral centers were created.</dc:description>

         <title>Multistage Stimulus&#8208;Responsive Room Temperature Phosphorescence Based on Host&#8208;Guest Doping Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compared with inorganic long&#8208;lasting luminescent materials, organic room temperature phosphorescent (RTP) ones show several advantages, such as flexibility, transparency, solubility and color adjustability. However, organic RTP materials close to commercialization are still to be developed. In this work, we developed a new host&#8208;guest doping system with stimulus&#8208;responsive RTP characteristics, in which triphenylphosphine oxide (  OPph  3  ) acted host and benzo(dibenzo)phenothiazine dioxide derivatives as guests. Turn&#8208;on RTP effect was realized by mixing them together through co&#8208;crystallization or grinding, in which the efficient energy transfer from host to guest and the strong intersystem crossing (ISC) ability of the guest have played significant role. Further on, multistage stimulus&#8208;responsive RTP characteristics from grinding to chemical stimulus were achieved  via  introducing pyridine group into the guest molecule. In addition, the anti&#8208;counterfeiting printings were realized for these materials through various methods, including stylus printing, thermal printing and inkjet printing, which brings RTP materials closer to commercialization.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic enantioselective construction of chiral azepine skeleton bearing multiple&#8208;stereogenic elements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantioselective construction of molecules bearing multiple stereogenic elements is increasingly related to the synthesis of enantiopure natural products, pharmaceuticals, and functional materials. However, atom&#8208;economical and enantioselective approaches to install multiple stereogenic elements in a small molecular template by limited chemical transformation remain challenging. We describe an organocatalytic enantioselective method for the preparation of polychiral molecules bearing four types of stereogenic elements in fused azepines via vinylidene  ortho  &#8208;quinone methide (  VQM  )&#8208;mediated intramolecular electrophilic aromatic substitution. This method was proved robust with a wide range of substrate scope (46&#8208;92% yield), with excellent diastereoselectivity (&gt;20:1 dr) and enantioselectivity achieved (up to 97% ee). Optical properties and Ru  3+  &#8208;induced fluorescence responses of these compounds suggest their potential applications in optoelectronic materials and heavy metal ion detection.</dc:description>

         <title>Correlating Charge Transport Properties of Conjugated Polymers in Solution Aggregates and Thin&#8208;Film Aggregates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The role of solution aggregates on the charge transport process of conjugated polymers in electronic devices has gained increasing attention; however, the correlation of the charge carrier mobilities in the solution aggregates and the solid&#8208;state films remains elusive. Herein, three polymers, FBDOPV&#8208;2T, FBDOPV&#8208;2F2T, and FBDOPV&#8208;4F2T, are designed and synthesized, and exhibit distinct aggregation behavior in solution. By combining contact&#8208;free ultrafast Terahertz (THz) spectroscopy and field&#8208;effect transistor measurements, we track the charge carrier mobility of the aggregates of these polymers from the solution to thin&#8208;film states. Remarkably, the mobility of three polymers is found to follow nearly the same trend (FBDOPV&#8208;2T &gt; FBDOPV&#8208;2F2T &gt; &gt; FBDOPV&#8208;4F2T) in both solution and thin&#8208;film states. The quantitative mobility correlation indicates that the charge transport properties of solution aggregates play a critical role in determining the thin&#8208;film charge transport properties and final device performance. Our results highlight the importance of investigating and controlling solution aggregation structures towards efficient organic electronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation of Aryl Carboxylic Acids by Diboron Reagents towards Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Decarbonylative Borylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Ni&#8208;catalyzed decarbonylative borylation of (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids with B&#8322;cat&#8322; has been achieved without recourse to any additives. This Ni&#8208;catalyzed method exhibits a broad substrate scope covering poorly reactive non&#8208;  ortho  &#8208;substituted (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids, and tolerates diverse functional groups including some of the groups active to Ni(0) catalysts.&#160;The key to achieve  this decarbonylative borylation reaction is the choice of  B&#8322;cat&#8322; as a coupling partner that not only acts as a borylating reagent, but also chemoselectively activates aryl carboxylic acids towards oxidative addition of their C(acyl)&#8208;O bond to Ni(0) catalyst via the formation of acyloxyboron compounds. A combination of experimental and computational studies reveals a detailed plausible mechanism for this reaction system, which involves a hitherto unknown concerted decarbonylation and reductive elimination step that generates the aryl boronic ester product. This mode of boron&#8208;promoted  carboxylic acid  activation is also applicable to  other types of reactions  .</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We tap into an unexplored area of preferential crystallization, being the first to develop simultaneous chiral resolution of two racemic compounds by preferential cocrystallization. We highlight how the two racemic compounds RS&#8208;mandelic acid (MAN) and RS&#8208;etiracetam (ETI) can be combined together as enantiospecific R&#8208;MAN&#183;R&#8208;ETI and S&#8208;MAN&#183;S&#8208;ETI cocrystals forming a stable conglomerate system and subsequently develop a cyclic preferential crystallization allowing to simultaneous resolve both compounds. The developed process leads to excellent enantiopurity both for etiracetam (ee&gt;98%) and mandelic acid (ee~95%) enantiomers.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclic Amplification of the Afterglow Luminescent Nanoreporter Enables  to  Predict Anti&#8208;cancer Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Immunogenic cell death (ICD)&#8208;associated immunogenicity evoked through reactive oxygen species (ROS) is an efficient way to fight against the&#160;immune&#8208;dysfunctional microenvironment, so as to provoke potent anti&#8208;tumor immunity. However, the unknown ROS dose during cancer therapies may induce adverse immune responses (e.g., insufficient ICD, toxicity toward normal tissues or immune system). Herein, we developed a novel cyclic amplification method for an organic afterglow nanoreporter for the real&#8208;time visualization of self&#8208;generated ROS. First, we promoted semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (PFODBT) as a novel candidate for emitting near&#8208;infrared afterglow luminescence. Second, the introduction of a chemiluminescent substrate (CPPO) into PFODBT (PFODBT@CPPO) resulted in a significant enhancement of afterglow intensity through the dual cyclic amplification pathway involving singlet oxygen (  1  O  2  ). Third,  1  O  2  produced by PFODBT@CPPO&#160;induced cancer cell necrosis and promoted the release of damage&#8208;related molecular patterns, thereby evoking ICD&#8208;associated immune responses through ROS&#8208;based oxidative stress. Notably, the afterglow luminescent signals of the nanoreporter were well correlated with light&#8208;driven  1  O  2  generation and anti&#8208;cancer efficiency, respectively. Overall, our imaging strategy provided a non&#8208;invasive tool for predicting the degree of ICD that occurs during ROS&#8208;mediated cancer therapy, which may contribute to precise immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Alternating Current Electrolysis as Efficient Tool for the Direct Electrochemical Oxidation of Hydroxamic Acids for Acyl Nitroso Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The acyl nitroso Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of 1,3&#8208;dienes with electrochemically oxidised hydroxamic acids is described. By using alternating current electrolysis, their typical electro&#8208;induced decomposition could be suppressed in favour of the 1,2&#8208;oxazine cycloaddition products. The reaction was optimised using Design of Experiments (DoE) and a sensitivity test was conducted. A mixture of triethylamine/hexafluoroisopropanol served as supporting electrolyte in dichloromethane, thus giving products of high purity after evaporation of the volatiles without further purification. The optimised reaction conditions were applied to various 1,3&#8208;dienes and hydroxamic acids, giving up to 96% isolated yield.</dc:description>

A mixture of triethylamine/hexafluoroisopropanol served as supporting electrolyte in dichloromethane, thus giving products of high purity after evaporation of the volatiles without further purification. The optimised reaction conditions were applied to various 1,3-dienes and hydroxamic acids, giving up to 96% isolated yield.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of C&#8208;Vinyl Glycosides via Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8211;H Glycosylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C  &#8208;vinyl glycosides are an important class of carbohydrates and pose unique synthetic challenge. A new strategy has been developed for stereoselective synthesis of  C  &#8208;vinyl glycosides via Pd&#8208;catalyzed directed C&#8208;H glycosylation of alkenes with glycosyl chloride donors using an easily removable bidentate auxiliary. Both the &#947;&#160;C&#8208;H bond of allylamines and the &#948; C&#8208;H bond of homoallyl amine substrates can be glycosylated in high efficiency and with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. The resulting  C  &#8208;vinyl glycosides can be further converted to a variety of  C  &#8208;alkyl glycosides with high stereospecificity. These reactions offer a broadly applicable method to streamline the synthesis of complex  C  &#8208;vinyl glycosides from easily accessible starting materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Real&#8208;time Tracking and Sensing of Cu+ and Cu2+ with a Single SERS Probe in the Live Brain: Toward Understanding Why Copper Ions Were Increased upon Ischemia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The imbalance of Cu  +  and Cu  2+  in the brain is closely related to neurodegenerative diseases. However, it still lacks of effective analytical methods for simultaneously determining the concentrations of Cu  +  and Cu  2+  . Herein, we created a novel SERS probe (CuSP) to real&#8208;time track and accurately quantify extracellular concentrations of Cu  +  and Cu  2+  in the live brain. The present CuSP probe demonstrated specific ability for recognition of Cu  +  and Cu  2+  in a dual&#8208;recognition mode. Then, a microarray consisting of 8 CuSP probes with high tempo&#8208;spatial resolution and good accuracy was constructed for tracking and simultaneously biosensing of Cu  +  and Cu  2+  in the cerebral cortex of living brain. Using our powerful tool, it was found that that the concentrations of Cu  2+  and Cu  +  were increased by ~4.26 and ~1.80 times upon ischemia, respectively. Three routes were first discovered for understanding the mechanisms of the increased concentrations of Cu  +  and Cu  2+  during ischemia.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Approach to Design Dual Ratiometric Fluorescent and Photoacoustic Probe for Quantitatively Visualizing Tumor Hypoxia Levels in Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of ratiometric imaging techniques to quantitatively measure hypoxia levels  in vivo  is essential in predicting the effectiveness of cancer treatments and diagnostics. With complementary advantages of near&#8208;infrared fluorescent (NIRF) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging, NIRF/PA dual&#8208;ratiometric probes are imperative for precisely visualizing tumor hypoxia levels. However, because the absorbed excitation energy is fixed in a single chromophore, its NIRF and PA effects are always competitive, which greatly thwarts the development of NIRF/PA dual&#8208;ratiometric probes. Herein, for the first time, we describe an energy balance strategy between fluorescence and photoacoustic effects by sulfur substitution to transform existing hemicyanine dyes (Cy) into optimized NIRF/PA dual ratiometric scaffolds. Based on this optimized scaffold, we reported the first dual&#8208;ratio response of nitroreductase probe AS&#8208;Cy&#8208;NO  2  which allows quantitative visualization of tumor hypoxia  in vivo  . AS&#8208;Cy&#8208;NO  2  , composed of a new NIRF/PA scaffold thioxanthene&#8208;hemicyanine (AS&#8208;Cy) and a 4&#8208;nitrobenzene moiety, showed a 10&#8208;fold ratiometric NIRF enhancement (I  773  /I  733  ) and 2.4&#8208;fold ratiometric PA enhancement (PA  730  /PA  670  ) upon activation by a biomarker (nitroreductase, NTR) associated with tumor hypoxia. Moreover, the dual ratiometric NIRF/PA imaging accurately quantified hypoxia extent with high sensitivity and high imaging depth in xenograft breast cancer models. More importantly, the 3D maximal intensity projection (MIP) PA images of the probe can precisely differentiate the highly heterogeneous oxygen distribution in solid tumor. Thus, this study not only presents the first dual ratiometric NIRF and PA probe for quantitatively and precisely monitoring of tumor hypoxia levels but also provides a promising NIRF/PA scaffold that may be generalized for applying in dual ratiometric imaging of other disease&#8208;relevant biomarkers.</dc:description>

         <title>BODIPY&#8208;based Photodynamic Agents for Exclusively Generating Superoxide Radical over Singlet Oxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing Type&#8208;I photosensitizers are considered as an efficient approach to overcome the deficiency of traditional photodynamic therapy (PDT) for hypoxic tumors. However, it remains a challenge to design photosensitizers for generating reactive oxygen species by the Type&#8208;I process. Herein, we report a series of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;linked BODIPY dimers and a trimer that exclusively generate superoxide radical (O2&#8722;&#8226;) by the Type&#8208;I process upon light irradiation. The triplet formation originates from an effective excited&#8208;state relaxation from the initially populated singlet (S1) to triplet (T1) states via an intermediate triplet (T2) state. The low reduction potential and ultralong lifetime of the T1 state facilitate the efficient generation of O2&#8722;&#8226; by inter&#8208;molecular charge transfer to molecular oxygen. The T1&#8208;S0 energy gap is smaller than that of O2 thereby precluding the generation of singlet oxygen by the Type&#8208;II process. The trimer exhibits superior PDT performance under the hypoxic environment.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Encoding of Triple&#8208;bond Raman Scattering of Single Polymer Nanoparticles for Multiplexed Imaging Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy in combination with innovative tagging strategies offers great potential as a universal high&#8208;throughput biomedical imaging tool. Here, we report on rationally tailored small molecular monomers containing triple&#8208;bond units with large Raman scattering cross&#8208;sections, which can be polymerized at the nanoscale for enhancement of SRS contrast with smaller but brighter optical nanotags with artificial &#8216;fingerprint&#8217; output. From this, a class of triple&#8208;bond rich polymer nanoparticles (NPs) was engineered by regulating the relative dosages of three chemically different triple&#8208;bond monomers in co&#8208;polymerization. The suggested bonding strategy allowed for 15 spectrally distinguishable triple&#8208;bond combinations. These accurately structured nano molecular aggregates, rather than long&#8208;chain macromolecules, could establish a universal method for generating small&#8208;sized biological SRS imaging tags with high&#8208;sensitivity for high&#8208;throughput multi&#8208;color biomedical imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluoride Chemistry in Tin Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tin is the frontrunner for substituting toxic lead in perovskite solar cells. However, tin suffers the detrimental oxidation of Sn(II) to Sn(IV). Most of reported strategies employ SnF  2  in the perovskite precursor solution to prevent Sn(IV) formation. Nevertheless, the working mechanism of this additive remains debated. To further elucidate it, we investigate the fluoride chemistry in tin halide perovskites by complementary analytical tools. NMR of the precursor solution discloses a strong preferential affinity of fluoride anions for Sn(IV) over Sn(II), selectively complexing it as SnF  4  . Hard X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy on films shows the lower tendency of SnF  4  than SnI  4  to get included in the perovskite structure, hence preventing the inclusion of Sn(IV) in the film. Finally, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering reveals the strong influence of fluoride on the colloidal chemistry of precursor dispersions, directly affecting perovskite crystallization. Combining these analytical tools, we provide a complete picture of fluoride's working mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Atom Deletion in Nitrogen Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Excising the nitrogen in secondary amines, and&#160;coupling the two residual fragments is a skeletal editing strategy that can be used to construct molecules with new skeletons, but which has been largely unexplored. Here we report a versatile method of N&#8208;atom excision from N&#8208;heterocycles. The process uses readily available N&#8208;heterocycles as substrates, and proceeds by N&#8208;sulfonylazidonation followed by the rearrangement of sulfamoyl azide intermediates, providing various cyclic products. Examples are provided of deletion of nitrogen from natural products, synthesis of chiral O&#8208;heterocycles from commercially available chiral &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols, formal inert C&#8211;H functionalization through a sequence of N&#8208;directed C&#8211;H functionalization and N&#8208;atom deletion reactions in which the N&#8208;atom can serve as a traceless directing group.</dc:description>

         <title>An Atomic Insight into the Chemical Origin and Variation of Dielectric Constant in Liquid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dielectric constant is a crucial physicochemical property of liquids in tuning solute&#8211;solvent interactions and solvation microstructures. Herein the dielectric constant variation of liquid electrolytes regarding to temperatures and electrolyte compositions is probed by molecular dynamics simulations. Dielectric constants of solvents reduce as temperatures increase due to accelerated mobility of molecules. For solvent mixtures with different mixing ratios, their dielectric constants either follow a linear superposition rule or satisfy a polynomial function, depending on weak or strong intermolecular interactions. Dielectric constants of electrolytes exhibit a volcano trend with increasing salt concentrations, which can be attributed to dielectric contributions from salts and formation of solvation structures. This work affords an atomic insight into the dielectric constant variation and its chemical origin, which can deepen the fundamental understanding in solution chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistical Dipole&#8208;Dipole Interactions Induced Self&#8208;Assembly of Phenoxazine&#8208;Based Hole&#8208;Transporting Materials for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Delicately designed dopant&#8208;free hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) with ordered structure have become one of the major strategies to achieve high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, we report two donor&#8208;&#960; linker&#8208;donor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D) HTMs,  N01  and  N02  , which consist of facilely synthesized 4,8&#8208;di(  n  &#8208;hexyloxy)&#8208;benzo[1,2&#8208;  b  :4,5&#8208;  b'  ]dithiophene as a &#960; linker, with 10&#8208;bromohexyl&#8208;10  H  &#8208;phenoxazine and 10&#8208;hexyl&#8208;10  H  &#8208;phenoxazine as donors, respectively. Very interestingly, the results from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractions show that different alkyl substituents with/without bromine termination can render the molecules to self&#8208;assemble distinctively due to varied dipole&#8208;dipole interactions among adjacent molecules. Particularly, the  N01  molecules form a two&#8208;dimensional conjugated network governed by C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O and C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Br interaction between phenoxazine donors, and synchronously construct a three&#8208;dimension lamellar structure with the aid of interlaminar &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction. Consequently,  N01  as a dopant&#8208;free small&#8208;molecule HTM exhibits a higher intrinsic hole mobility and more favorable interfacial properties for hole transport, hole extraction and perovskite growth, enabling an inverted PSC to achieve a very impressive power conversion efficiency of 21.85%.</dc:description>

         <title>Effective and Rapid Removal of Polar Organic Micropollutants from Water by Amide Naphthotube&#8208;Crosslinked Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is challenging to remove polar organic micropollutants from water through adsorption&#8208;mediated processes. Macrocycle&#8208;crosslinked polymers were recently shown to be effective adsorbents for nonpolar or charged organic micropollutants through specific host&#8208;guest binding, but are rarely used for the treatment of neutral and polar organic micropollutants. This is due to the challenge of recognizing polar molecules in water by macrocyclic hosts. In this research, we report two amide naphthotube&#8208;crosslinked polymers which can effectively and rapidly adsorb a wide scope of polar organic micropollutants from water through biomimetic molecular recognition. Amide naphthotubes possess hydrogen bonding sites in their deep hydrophobic cavities and can effectively bind polar organic micropollutants in water through the hydrophobic effects and shielded hydrogen bonds. The cross&#8208;linked polymers containing amide naphthotubes are even able to remove a complex mixture of organic micropollutants from water and the used materials can be easily regenerated through washing with MeOH or EtOH. This research provides a solution for the treatment of polar organic micropollutants by using biomimetic molecular recognition in water.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bonding in beryllocene, [BeCp  2  ], took decades to establish, owing to its unexpected mixed hapticity structure (i.e., [Be(&#951;  5  &#8208;Cp)(&#951;  1  &#8208;Cp)]). Beryllium complexes containing the indenyl ligand, which is a close relative of the cyclopentadienyl anion, but which is also known to exhibit its own bonding peculiarities (e.g., facile &#951;  5  &#8644; &#951;  3  shifts), have remained unknown. Standard metathetical approaches to their synthesis (e.g., with K[Ind&#180;] + BeX  2  in an ether solvent) give rise to intractable oils from which nothing identifiable can be isolated. In contrast, mechanochemical preparation, involving the solvent&#8208;free grinding of BeBr  2  and potassium indenides, leads to the production of discrete (indenyl)beryllium complexes, including [Be(C  9  H  7  )  2  ] (  1  ) and [Be{1,3&#8208;(SiMe  3  )  2  C  9  H  5  }Br] (  2  ). The former displays &#951;  5  /&#951;  1  &#8208;coordinated ligands in the solid state, but DFT calculations indicate that a &#951;  5  /&#951;  5  &#8208;conformation is less than 5 kcal mol  &#8211;1  higher in energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantiospecific Detection of D&#8208;Amino Acid through Synergistic Upconversion Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>D&#8208;amino acids (DAAs) are indispensable in regulating diverse metabolic pathways. Selective and sensitive detection of DAAs is crucial for understanding the complexity of metabolic processes and managing associated diseases.

Here we report an enzyme&#8208;coupled nanoprobe that can detect enantiospecific DAAs through synergistic energy transfer. This nanoprobe offers near&#8208;infrared upconversion capability, a wide dynamic detection range, and a detection limit of 2.2 &#956;M, providing a versatile platform for  in vivo  noninvasive detection of DAAs with high enantioselectivity.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;D-amino acids (DAAs) are indispensable in regulating diverse metabolic pathways. Selective and sensitive detection of DAAs is crucial for understanding the complexity of metabolic processes and managing associated diseases.

         <title>Resistance&#8208;Chiral Anisotropy of Chiral Mesostructured Half&#8208;metallic Fe3O4&#160;Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Half&#8208;metallic materials are theoretically predicted to be metallic and insulating, which have not been confirmed experimentally, and the predictions are still in doubt. We report&#160; the&#160; resistance&#8208;chiral anisotropy (R&#8208;ChA), i.e., chirality&#8208;dependent electrical conductivity, in chiral mesostructured Fe  3  O  4  &#160;films (CMFFs)&#160;grown on&#160; the&#160; substrates&#160;  via  &#160;a hydrothermal method using amino acids as symmetry&#8208;breaking agents. Two levels of chirality exist in the CMFFs: primary distortion of the crystal lattice forms twisted nanoflakes, and secondary helical stacking of nanoflakes forms fan&#8208;shaped nanoplates. At temperatures below 30 K, the CMFFs exhibited metallic conductivity and insulation for one handedness and the other, respectively. The chirality&#8208;dependent effective magnetic fields were speculated to stabilize the opposite spin in the antipodal chiral frame , which &#160;led to the free transport of electrons in one handedness of the chiral structure and immobility for the other handedness.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterometal doping is a powerful method for tuning the physicochemical properties of metal nanoclusters. While the heterometals doped into such nanoclusters predominantly include transition metals with closed d&#8208;shells, the doping of open d&#8208;shell metals remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report the first synthesis of a [RhHAg24(SPhMe2)18]2&#8722;  nanocluster, in which a Rh atom with open d&#8208;shells ([Kr]4d85s1) is incorporated into the Ag24  framework by forming a RhH superatom with closed d&#8208;shells ([Kr]4d10). Combined experimental and theoretical investigations showed that the Ag24  framework was co&#8208;doped with Rh and hydride and that the RhH dopant was a superatomic construct of a Pd atom. Additional studies demonstrated that the [RhHAg24(SPhMe2)18]2&#8722;  nanocluster was isoelectronic to the [PdAg24(SPhMe2)18]2&#8722;  nanocluster with the superatomic 8&#8208;electron configuration (1S21P6). This study demonstrated for the first time that a superatom could be incorporated into a cluster superatom to generate a stable superatom&#8208;in&#8208;superatom nanocluster.</dc:description>

A variety of terminal alkynes undergo this asymmetric transformation, affording the corresponding  gem  &#8208;(borylsilyl)alkane products with high enantioselectivity (up to 98%  ee  ). This one&#8208;pot reaction combines (  E  )&#8208;selective hydrosiylation of alkynes and consecutive enantioselective hydroboration of (  E  )&#8208;vinylsilanes with one chiral cobalt catalyst.

         <title>Dopant&#8208;free Hole Transport Materials Afford Efficient and Stable Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emerging CsPbI3 perovskites are highly efficient and thermally stable materials for wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but the doped hole transport materials (HTMs) accelerate the undesirable phase transition of CsPbI3 in ambient. Herein, a dopant&#8208;free D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type HTM named CI&#8208;TTIN&#8208;2F has been developed which overcomes this problem. The suitable optoelectronic properties and energy&#8208;level alignment endow CI&#8208;TTIN&#8208;2F with excellent charge collection properties. Moreover, CI&#8208;TTIN&#8208;2F provides multisite defect&#8208;healing effects on the defective sites of CsPbI3 surface. Inorganic CsPbI3 PSCs with CI&#8208;TTIN&#8208;2F HTM feature high efficiencies up to 15.9%, along with 86% efficiency retention after 1000 h under ambient conditions. Inorganic perovskite solar modules were also fabricated that exhibiting an efficiency of 11.0% with a record area of 27 cm2. This work confirms that using efficient dopant&#8208;free HTMs is an attractive strategy to stabilize inorganic PSCs for their future scale&#8208;up.</dc:description>

         <title>Chirality&#8208;Dependent Second&#8208;order Nonlinear Optical Effects in 1D Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Perovskites Bulk Single Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of chirality into organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) is expected to achieve excellent photoelectric and nonlinear materials related to circular dichroism. Chirality&#8208;dependent circular photogalvanic effect and spin transport have already been studied in OIHPs. However, chirality&#8208;dependent second harmonic generation (SHG) is rarely studied in bulk single crystal of OIHPs. Due to the existence of asymmetric center and intrinsic chirality in the chiral OIHPs, the different efficiencies of SHG signal occurs when the circularly polarized light (CPL) with different phases passes through the chiral crystal, which is defined as second harmonic generation circular dichroism (SHG&#8208;CD). Here, the SHG&#8208;CD effect has been successfully developed in bulk single crystals chiral one&#8208;dimensional (1D) [(  R  /  S  )&#8208;3&#8208;aminopiperidine]PbI  4  , which crystallize in a chiral space group  P  2  1  2  1  2  1  . More importantly, it is the first time to distinguish CPL using chirality&#8208;dependent SHG&#8208;CD effect in OIHPs bulk single crystals. Furthermore, such SHG&#8208;CD technology breaks through the conventional CPL detection using chiral semiconductor, thus extending the detection range to near infrared region (NIR). In this way, the anisotropy factor (g  SHG&#8208;CD  ) through SHG&#8208;CD signal is as high as 0.21. The results not only expand the applications of chiral OIHPs in nonlinear optics (NLO) field, but also provide a new method to distinguish the CPL in NIR.</dc:description>

         <title>Chromoselective Synthesis of Sulfonyl Chlorides and Sulfonamides with Potassium Poly(heptazine imide) Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Among external stimuli used to promote a chemical reaction, photocatalysis possesses a unique one &#8208; light. Photons are traceless reagents that provide an exclusive opportunity to alter chemoselectivity of the photocatalytic reaction varying the color of incident light. This strategy may be implemented by using a sensitizer capable to activate a specific reaction pathway depending on the excitation light. Herein, we use potassium poly(heptazine imide) (K&#8208;PHI), a type of carbon nitride, to generate selectively three different products from S&#8208;arylthioacetates simply varying the excitation light and otherwise identical conditions. Namely, arylchlorides are produced under UV/purple, sulfonyl chlorides with blue/white, and diaryldisulfides at green to red light. A combination of the negatively charged polyanion, highly positive potential of the valence band, presence of intraband states, ability to sensitize singlet oxygen, and multi&#8208;electron transfer is shown to enable this chromoselective conversion of thioacetates.</dc:description>

         <title>Formation and Cycloaddition Reactions of a Reactive Internally N&#8208;heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;stabilized Boraalkene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of element&#8208;carbon double bonds is of great importance for the development and understanding of reactive &#960;&#8208;bonded systems in chemistry. The seven&#8208;membered heterocyclic system 4b is readily made by internal C&#8211;H activation at a pendent isopropyl methyl group of the respective [(IPr)C6F5BH]+ borenium ion. Subsequent deprotonation with the IMes carbene gives the neutral cyclic boraalkene system 5b. The B=C double bond in compound 5b adds carbon dioxide, CS2, sulfur dioxide, phenyl isocyanate, an acetylene ester or two NO molecules to give the corresponding four&#8208;membered ring annulated heterocycles. With sulfur or selenium 5b gives the respective three&#8208;membered ring systems. N2O reacts with 5b to give a mixture of the related oxaborinane 18 and a unique [B]OH containing diazoalkane product 19. The neutral B=C functionality in compound 5b shows a reactivity of a reactive polar &#960;&#8208;bond.</dc:description>

         <title>A Microporous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for the Efficient Capture and Purification of Propylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adsorptive separation of propylene/propane (C  3  H  6  /C  3  H  8  ) mixture is highly desired for its potential energy saving on replacing currently deployed and energy&#8208;intensive cryogenic distillation technique. Realizing efficient C  3  H  6  /C  3  H  8  separation in the emerging hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) is very challenging and has been rarely reported due to the lack of functional sites for preferential gas binding. By virtue of crystal engineering, we herein report a rare example of functionalized HOF (termed as  HOF&#8208;16  ) with free &#8210;COOH sites for the e&#64259;cient separation of C  3  H  6  /C  3  H  8  mixtures. Under ambient conditions,  HOF&#8208;16  shows a significant C  3  H  6  /C  3  H  8  uptake difference (by 76%) and selectivity (5.4) in contrast to those of other carboxylic acid&#8208;based HOFs. Modeling studies indicate that free &#8210;COOH groups together with the suitable pore confinement facilitate the recognition and high&#8208;density packing of gas molecules. The separation performance of  HOF&#8208;16  has also been validated by breakthrough experiments.  HOF&#8208;16  is stable in harsh condition including strong acidity and water.</dc:description>
