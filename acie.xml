         <title>Rational Surface&#8208;Defect Control via Designed Passivation for High&#8208;Efficiency Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inorganic metal&#8208;halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) hold the promise to achieve high efficiency with excellent thermal stability. However, severe nonradiative charge recombination induced by traps causes photo&#8208;voltage loss, hence restraining the power conversion efficiency of PSCs from approaching the Shockley&#8722;Queisser (S&#8208;Q) limit. Our study using density functional theory reveals that the iodine vacancies (V  I  ) on the surface of all&#8208;inorganic metal&#8208;halide perovskite films are the predominant defects that trap free charge carriers. An environmentally benign material, histamine (HA), is designed to intentionally passivate the V  I  in the perovskite thin films. Theoretical study shows that HA bonds to the V  I  on the surface of the perovskite film via a Lewis&#8208;base&#8208;acid interaction, while an additional hydrogen bond (H&#8208;bond) strengthens such interaction due to the favorable molecular configuration of HA. Moreover, it is found that undercoordinated Pb  2+  and Pb clusters are passivated, leading to significantly reduced surface trap density and prolonged charge lifetime within the perovskite films. The HA passivation also induces an upward shift of the energy band edge of the perovskite layer, facilitating interfacial hole transfer. The combination of the above raises the solar cell efficiency from 19.5 to 20.8% as measured under 100 mW cm  &#8208;2  illumination, the highest efficiency so far for inorganic metal&#8208;halide PSCs. The strategy provides a rational design to effectively passivate all&#8208;inorganic perovskite to achieve high efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Ball Milling Enabled Reactivity of Manganese Metal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efforts to generate organomanganese reagents under ball milling conditions have led to the serendipitous discovery that manganese metal can mediate the reductive dimerization of arylidene malonates. The newly uncovered process has been optimized and its mechanism explored using CV measurements, radical trapping experiments, EPR spectroscopy and solution control reactions. This unique reactivity can also be translated to solution where upon pre&#8208;milling of the manganese is required.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneously Enhanced Reverse Intersystem Crossing and Radiative Decay in Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorophors with Multiple Through&#8208;space Charge Transfers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials with through&#8208;space charge transfers (CT) have attracted particularly interest recently. However, the slow reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) and radiative decay always limit their electroluminescence performances. Herein, TADF molecules with ortho&#8208;linked multiple donors&#8208;acceptor (ortho&#8208;D  n  &#8208;A) motif are developed to create near&#8208;degenerate excited states for the reinforcement of spin&#8208;orbit coupling. The incorporation of both through&#8208;bond and through&#8208;space CT enlarges oscillator strength. The optimal ortho&#8208;D  3  &#8208;A compound exhibits a photoluminescence quantum yield of ~100%, a high RISC rate of 2.57&#215;10  6  s  &#8208;1  and a high radiative decay rate of 1.00&#215;10  7  s  &#8208;1  simultaneously. With this compound as the sensitizer, a TADF&#8208;sensitized&#8208;fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diode shows a maximum external quantum efficiency of 31.6% with an ultrapure green Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage y coordinate value of 0.69.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal coordination&#8208;directed biomolecule crosslinking in nature has been used for synthetic various biopolymers, including DNA, peptides, proteins, and polysaccharides. However, biopolymer of RNA has been avoided as yet due to the poor stability of the RNA molecules, the formation of biopolymer may alter biological function of the biological molecules. Herein, for the first time, we report Zn2+&#8208;driven RNA self&#8208;assembly forming spherical nanoparticles, and with retaining the integrity and biological functions of RNA. Various functional RNAs of different compositions, shapes, and lengths from 20 to nearly 1000&#8208;nucleotides were packaged, highlighting the versatility of this approach. The assembled nanospheres possess superior RNA loading efficiency, pharmacokinetics, and bioavailability. In vitro and in vivo evaluation demonstrated mRNA delivery for expressing GFP proteins, and microRNA delivery to triple negative breast cancer. This coordination&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly behavior amplifies the horizons of RNA coordination chemistry and application scope of RNA&#8208;based therapeutic.</dc:description>

         <title>Pt&#8208;modulated Redox Property and HMF Adsorption Kinetics of Ni(OH)2 for Biomass Upgrading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)  2  ) is a promising electrocatalyst for the 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) and the dehydronated intermediates Ni(OH)O species are proved to be active sites for HMFOR. In this study, Ni(OH)  2  is modified by platinum to adjust the electronic structure and the current density of HMFOR improves 8.2 times at the Pt/Ni(OH)  2  electrode compared with that on Ni(OH)  2  electrode. Operando methods reveal that the introduction of Pt optimized the redox property of Ni(OH)  2  and accelerate the formation of Ni(OH)O during the catalytic process. Theoretical studies demonstrate that the enhanced Ni(OH)O formation kinetics originates from the reduced dehydrogenation energy of Ni(OH)  2  . The product analysis and transition state simulation prove that the Pt also reduces adsorption energy of HMF with optimized adsorption behavior as Pt can act as the adsorption site of HMF. Overall, this work here provides a strategy to design an efficient and universal nickel&#8208;based catalyst for HMF electro&#8208;oxidation, which can also be extended to other Ni&#8208;based catalysts such as Ni(HCO  3  )  2  and NiO.</dc:description>

         <title>Generation of &#945;&#8208;Boryl Radicals By H&#8226; Transfer and their Use in Cycloisomerizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon&#8208;centered radicals can be stabilized by delocalization of their spin density into the vacant p orbital of a boron substituent. &#945;&#8208;Vinyl boronates, in particular derivatives of pinacol (Bpin), are therefore excellent hydrogen atom acceptors, generating &#945;&#8208;boryl radicals from H  2  in the presence of a cobaloxime catalyst. These radicals undergo 5&#8208;exo radical cyclizations onto appropriate double bonds, eventually furnishing densely functionalized heterocycles with tertiary substituents on Bpin. The reaction shows good functional group tolerance, and the resulting unsaturated boronates can be easily converted into other useful functionalities.</dc:description>

         <title>Flow Chemistry&#8208;Enabled Divergent and Enantioselective Total Syntheses of Massarinolin A, Purpurolides B, D, E, 2,3&#8208;Deoxypurpurolide C, and Structural Revision of Massarinolin A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Massarinolin A and purpurolides are bioactive bergamotane sesquiterpenes condensed with a variety of synthetically challenging ring systems: a&#160;bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane, an oxasipro[3.4]octane, and a dioxaspiro[4.4]nonane (oxaspirolactone). Herein, we report the first enantioselective total syntheses of massarinolin A, purpurolides B, D, E, and 2,3&#8208;deoxypurpurolide C. Our synthesis and computational analysis also led to a structural revision of massarinolin A. The divergent approach features an enantioselective organocatalyzed Diels&#8208;Alder reaction to install the first stereogenic center in high ee, a scalable&#160;flow photochemical Wolff rearrangement to build the key bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane, a furan oxidative cyclization to form the oxaspirolactone, a late&#8208;stage allylic C&#8208;H oxidation, and a Myers&#8217; NBSH&#8208;promoted sigmatropic elimination to install the&#160;exo&#160;methylene group of massarinolin A.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Different cyanines absorbing in the NIR between 750&#8208;930 nm were applied to study the efficiency of both radical and cationic polymerization in combination with diaryliodonium salt.&#160;&#160;Variation of the connecting methine chain and structure of the terminal indolium moiety provided a deeper insight between the structure of the cyanine NIR&#8208;sensitizer and the efficiency to generate initiating radicals and conjugate acid. Photophysical studies were pursued by fluorescence spectroscopy providing a deeper understanding regarding the lifetime of the excited state and contribution of nonradiative deactivation resulting in generation of additional heat in the polymerization process. Furthermore, electrochemical experiments demonstrated connection to oxidation and reduction capability as influenced by the structural pattern of the sensitizer.&#160;&#160;LC&#8208;MS measurements provided a deeper pattern about the photoproducts formed.&#160;&#160;Surprisingly, a nonamethine based cyanine showed the best performance regarding bleaching in combination with an iodonium salt at 860 nm.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Photoexcitation of EthynylBenziodoXolones: An Alternative to Photocatalysis for Alkynylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>EthynylBenziodoXolones (EBXs) are commonly used as radical traps in photocatalytic alkynylations. Herein, we report that aryl&#8208;substituted EBX reagents can be directly activated by visible light irradiation. They act as both oxidants and radical traps, alleviating the need for a photocatalyst in several reported EBX&#8208;mediated processes, including decarboxylative and deboronative alkynylations, the oxyalkynylation of enamides and the C&#8208;H alkynylation of THF. In addition, the method could be applied to the synthesis of alkynylated quaternary centers from tertiary alcohols via stable oxalate salts and from tertiary amines via aryl imines. A photocatalytic process using 4CzIPN as an organic dye was also developed for the deoxyalkynylation of oxalates.</dc:description>

         <title>Distorted Sandwich a&#8208;Diimine Pd(II) Catalyst: Linear Polyethylene and Synthesis of&#160;Ethylene/Acrylate Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of m&#8208;xylyl substituents to &#945;&#8208;diimine Pd(II) catalyst promotes living ethylene polymerization at room temperature and low pressure to yield high molecular weight polyethylene (PE) with low branching (&lt;17/1000C). m&#8208;Xylyl groups provide a highly effective blockage to the axial sites of the catalytic center and form a distorted sandwich geometry. The shielding prevents chain&#8208;transfer and easy accessibility of polar monomers, leading to a living polymerization. Conducting a light irradiation as part of the one&#8208;step metal&#8208;organic insertion light initiated radical (MILRad) process leads to diblock copolymers of ethylene and acrylates. Incorporation of different acrylate block sequences can significantly modify the mechanical and chemical properties of block copolymers which can be modulated to be a hard plastic, elastomer, or semi&#8208;amorphous polymer.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatial Matching Selectivity and Solution Structure of Organic&#8211;Metal Hybrid to Quadruplex&#8211;Duplex Hybrid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solution structure of quadruplex&#8208;lateral duplex hybrid (QLDH) MYT1L&#8208;L1Pt(dien) complex shows that L1Pt(dien) presents a chair&#8208;type conformation, whose large aromatic &#8220;chair surface&#8221; intercalates into the G4&#8208;duplex interface via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, and &#8220;backrest&#8221; platinum unit interacts with duplex region through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, displaying a highly matched lock&#8208;key binding mode.







Abstract
The sequence&#8208;dependent DNA secondary structures possess structure polymorphism. To date, studies on regulated ligands mainly focus on individual DNA secondary topologies, while lack focus on quadruplex&#8211;duplex hybrids (QDHs). Here, we design an organic&#8211;metal hybrid ligand L1Pt(dien), which matches and selectively binds one type of QDHs with lateral duplex stem&#8208;loop (QLDH) with high affinity, while shows poor affinity for other QDHs and individual G4 or duplex DNA. The solution structure of QLDH MYT1L&#8208;L1Pt(dien) complex was determined by NMR. The structure reveals that L1Pt(dien) presents a chair&#8208;type conformation, whose large aromatic &#8220;chair surface&#8221; intercalates into the G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;duplex interface via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and &#8220;backrest&#8221; platinum unit interacts with duplex region through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, showing a highly matched lock&#8208;key binding mode. Our work provided guidance for spatial matching design of selectively targeting ligands to QDH structures.

         <title>Aluminium&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp)&#8722;H Borylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aluminium hydride catalyzed dehydroborylation of terminal alkynes is reported. By using a tethered&#8208;intramolecular&#8208;amine Lewis base as a ligand at the aluminium hydride centre the reactivity is controlled. Hydroalumination is switched off and selective reactions at the alkyne C&#8722;H &#963;&#8208;bond are enabled.







Abstract
Historically used in stoichiometric hydroalumination chemistry, recent advances have transformed aluminium hydrides into versatile catalysts for the hydroboration of unsaturated multiple bonds. This catalytic ability is founded on the defining reactivity of aluminium hydrides with alkynes and alkenes: 1,2&#8208;hydroalumination of the unsaturated &#960;&#8208;system. This manuscript reports the aluminium hydride catalyzed dehydroborylation of terminal alkynes. A tethered intramolecular amine ligand controls reactivity at the aluminium hydride centre, switching off hydroalumination and instead enabling selective reactions at the alkyne C&#8722;H &#963;&#8208;bond. Chemoselective C&#8722;H borylation was observed across a series of aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208;substituted alkynes (21 examples). On the basis of kinetic and density functional theory studies, a mechanism in which C&#8722;H borylation proceeds by &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis between pinacolborane (HBpin) and alkynyl aluminium intermediates is proposed.

         <dc:description>
A hypoxia&#8208;responsive nanocomposite composed of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 attached to gold nanorods delivers Cas9&#8208;sgHSP90&#945; to tumors. Gene editing reduces the thermal tolerance of the tumor cells and then mild photothermal therapy (PTT) is possible with near&#8208;IR light.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;light&#8208;triggered photothermal therapy (PTT) is usually associated with undesirable damage to healthy organs nearby due to the high temperatures (&gt;50&#8201;&#176;C) available for tumor ablation. Low&#8208;temperature PTT would therefore have tremendous value for clinical application. Here, we construct a hypoxia&#8208;responsive gold nanorods (AuNRs)&#8208;based nanocomposite of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 for mild&#8208;photothermal therapy via tumor&#8208;targeted gene editing. AuNRs are modified with azobenzene&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (p&#8208;AZO) to achieve on&#8208;demand release of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 using hypoxia&#8208;responsive azo bonds. In the hypoxic tumor microenvironment, the azo groups of the hypoxia&#8208;activated CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 nanosystem based on gold nanorods (APACPs) are selectively reduced by the overexpression of reductases, leading to the release of Cas9 and subsequent gene editing. Owing to the knockout of HSP90&#945; for reducing the thermal resistance of cancer cells, highly effective tumor ablation both in vitro and in vivo was achieved with APACPs under mild PTT.

         <title>In&#8208;Cell Characterization of the Stable Tyrosyl Radical in E. coli Ribonucleotide Reductase Using Advanced EPR Spectroscopy</title>

         <dc:description>
The in vivo structure of the redox&#8208;active tyrosyl radical in ribonucleotide reductase that catalyses the biosynthesis of DNA building blocks was explored using advanced EPR spectroscopic techniques. Furthermore, the radical form of a tyrosine derivative within the cells was generated. Our results mark the initial steps towards gaining unique insights into the redox reactions involving tyrosyl radicals under physiological conditions.







Abstract
The E. coli ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), a paradigm for class Ia enzymes including human RNR, catalyzes the biosynthesis of DNA building blocks and requires a di&#8208;iron tyrosyl radical (Y122.) cofactor for activity. The knowledge on the in vitro Y122. structure and its radical distribution within the &#946;2 subunit has accumulated over the years; yet little information exists on the in vivo Y122.. Here, we characterize this essential radical in whole cells. Multi&#8208;frequency EPR and electron&#8208;nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) demonstrate that the structure and electrostatic environment of Y122. are identical under in vivo and in vitro conditions. Pulsed dipolar EPR experiments shed light on a distinct in vivo Y122. per &#946;2 distribution, supporting the key role of Y. concentrations in regulating RNR activity. Additionally, we spectroscopically verify the generation of an unnatural amino acid radical, F3Y122., in whole cells, providing a crucial step towards unique insights into the RNR catalysis under physiological conditions.

         <title>Programmable Chromism and Photoluminescence of Spiropyran&#8208;Based Liquid Crystalline Polymer with Tunable Glass Transition Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19406-19412, August 23, 2021. </description>

A cross&#8208;linkable spiropyran&#8208;based molecule (SPBM) containing mesogenic units with switchable color, photoluminescence and mesomorphism is synthesized. Therefore, programmable chromism and photoluminescence can be endowed to the functional materials prepared from the SPBMs, which own a tunable glass transition temperature (Tg) by converting the configuration of the crosslinked SPBMs to change the molecular order degree.







Abstract
Spiropyran&#8208;based materials (SPBMs) can give responses to the stimulations induced by the light, heat, force, or pH, which have been used as triggers for many smart materials. Here, a cross&#8208;linkable SPBM containing mesogenic&#8208;units is synthesized, which is pale&#8208;colored, non&#8208;photoluminescent and non&#8208;mesogenic at a spiro form, but dark&#8208;colored, photoluminescent, and mesogenic at a merocyanine form. Moreover, the dynamic interconversion behavior of the form in the different chemical environments are distinct. Liquid crystalline polymers (LCPs) containing the SPBMs cross&#8208;linked via visible light, own a photoswitchable glass transition temperature (Tg) and retain the switchable property; however, the SPBMs cross&#8208;linked via UV light will be locked at the MC state, because the molecular movement was frozen at the room temperature lower than the given Tg of the LCP. Thus, programmable chromism and photoluminescence based on the tunable Tg can be endowed to the functional materials prepared from the SPBMs.

The novel isomerase NsrQ from Aspergillus novofumigatus is a key enzyme for the structural diversification of the fungal tetrahydroxanthones. The crystal structures of NsrQ and its homologue Dcr3 in complex with substrate analogues provided a structural basis for the dual isomerization reactions. These findings will lead to mechanistic understanding of the diversification and the stereochemical control in tetrahydroxanthone biosynthesis.







Abstract
The novel isomerase NsrQ, from Aspergillus novofumigatus, is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of fungal tetrahydroxanthones and is responsible for dearomatizing cyclization to provide a tetrahydroxanthone scaffold. NsrQ catalyzes a two&#8208;step isomerization reaction, involving the isomerization of allylic alcohol and subsequent inversion of configuration at the methyl group. We report on the biochemical and structural characterizations of NsrQ, and its homologue Dcr3, from Diaporthe longicolla. The crystal structures of NsrQ and Dcr3 revealed their similar overall structures, with a cone&#8208;shaped &#945;+&#946; barrel fold, to those of the nuclear transport factor 2&#8208;like superfamily enzymes. Furthermore, the structures of Dcr3 and NsrQ variants complexed with substrate analogues and the site&#8208;directed mutagenesis studies identified the catalytic residues and the important hydrophobic residues in shaping the active site pocket for substrate binding. These enzymes thus utilize Glu and His residues as acid&#8208;base catalysts. Based on these observations, we proposed a detailed reaction mechanism for NsrQ&#8208;catalyzed isomerization reactions.

A simple di&#8208;quaternary ammonium cation was used as structure&#8208;directing agent to prepare few&#8208;unit&#8208;cell (ca. 10&#8197;nm) MFI type zeolite catalysts and adsorbents with a wide range of composition (pure silica, aluminosilicate and stannosilicate). The SDA design was selected based on simple heuristic arguments regarding contributions of its structural elements to early crystal growth characteristics of MFI.







Abstract
Synthesis of a pentasil&#8208;type zeolite with ultra&#8208;small few&#8208;unit&#8208;cell crystalline domains, which we call FDP (few&#8208;unit&#8208;cell crystalline domain pentasil), is reported. FDP is made using bis&#8208;1,5(tributyl ammonium) pentamethylene cations as structure directing agent (SDA). This di&#8208;quaternary ammonium SDA combines butyl ammonium, in place of the one commonly used for MFI synthesis, propyl ammonium, and a five&#8208;carbon nitrogen&#8208;connecting chain, in place of the six&#8208;carbon connecting chain SDAs that are known to fit well within the MFI pores. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and electron microscopy imaging of FDP indicate ca. 10&#8197;nm crystalline domains organized in hierarchical micro&#8208;/meso&#8208;porous aggregates exhibiting mesoscopic order with an aggregate particle size up to ca. 5&#8197;&#956;m. Al and Sn can be incorporated into the FDP zeolite framework to produce active and selective methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbon and glucose isomerization catalysts, respectively.

X-ray diffraction analysis and electron microscopy imaging of FDP indicate ca. 10&#8197;nm crystalline domains organized in hierarchical micro-/meso-porous aggregates exhibiting mesoscopic order with an aggregate particle size up to ca. 5&#8197;&#956;m. Al and Sn can be incorporated into the FDP zeolite framework to produce active and selective methanol-to-hydrocarbon and glucose isomerization catalysts, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Monitoring Metabolites Using an NAD(P)H&#8208;sensitive Polymer Dot and a Metabolite&#8208;Specific Enzyme</title>

A metabolite biosensor is developed by integrating an NAD(P)H&#8208;sensitive semiconducting polymer dot and a metabolite&#8208;specific NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent enzyme. Metabolite concentration can be measured ratiometrically with high sensitivity and specificity. Phenylalanine biosensing in human plasma is shown for a phenylketonuria screening test, quantitation of other disease&#8208;related metabolites, and a paper&#8208;based assay with smartphone imaging.







Abstract
We introduce an NAD(P)H&#8208;sensitive polymer dot (Pdot) biosensor for point&#8208;of&#8208;care monitoring of metabolites. The Pdot is combined with a metabolite&#8208;specific NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of the metabolite, generating NAD(P)H. Upon UV illumination, the NAD(P)H quenches the fluorescence emission of Pdot at 627&#8197;nm via electron transfer, and also fluoresces at 458&#8197;nm, resulting in a shift from red to blue emission at higher NAD(P)H concentrations. Metabolite concentration is quantified ratiometrically&#8208;based on the ratio of blue&#8208;to&#8208;red channel emission intensities, with a digital camera&#8208;with high sensitivity and specificity. We demonstrate phenylalanine biosensing in human plasma for a phenylketonuria screening test, quantifying several other disease&#8208;related metabolites (lactate, glucose, glutamate, and &#946;&#8208;hydroxybutyrate), and a paper&#8208;based assay with smartphore imaging for point&#8208;of&#8208;care use.

         <title>Chiral V&#8208;shaped Pyrenes: Hexagonal Packing, Superhelix, and Amplified Chiroptical Performance</title>

Symmetric and dissymmetric chiral V&#8208;shaped pyrenes showed molecular&#8208;conformation&#8208;guided chiral hexagonal supramolecular packing and formed various helical nanoarchitectures, including unprecedented superhelices with molecular rigidity and assembly&#8208;boosted chiroptical performance.







Abstract
Here, we designed symmetric and dissymmetric chiral V&#8208;shaped pyrenes by linking achiral pyrenes to trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexane diamine scaffolds with varied spacers to investigate their circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized excimer emission (CPEE). In molecular solution, the symmetric V&#8208;shaped molecules (P1, P2, P3) displayed spacer&#8208;dependent CD and CPEE originating from the intramolecular excimers while the dissymmetric V&#8208;shaped B was silent in CD and CPEE. Upon self&#8208;assembly, the chiral V&#8208;shaped conformation guided a helical hexagonal packing. Notably, P1 self&#8208;assembled into delicate superhelices with optimum chiroptical activities and the largest gCD for pyrene derivatives to date. The dissymmetric B formed two distinct hexagonal aggregates as twists and rectangular nanotubes with greatly amplified CPEE. This work demonstrates unprecedented hexagonal superhelices from chiral V&#8208;shaped scaffolds and provides a deep insight into the relationship between molecular conformation, supramolecular architectures, and their chiroptical performance.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Reversal Polymer Nano&#8208;modulators for Photodynamic Immunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19355-19363, August 23, 2021. </description>

Charge&#8208;reversal polymer nano&#8208;modulators that can be specifically activated by acidic tumor microenvironment to release immunomodulator and enhance tumor penetration are developed for combinational photodynamic cancer immunotherapy.







Abstract
Nanomedicine can regulate the balance between cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and suppressive regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs), which however has been rarely exploited for cancer immunotherapy. We report a charge&#8208;reversal polymer nano&#8208;modulator (SPDMCN) activated by tumor microenvironment (TME) for photodynamic immunotherapy of cancer. SPDMCN is constructed by conjugating an immunomodulator (demethylcantharidin, DMC) to the side chains of a photodynamic polymer via an acid&#8208;liable linker. The negative charge of SPDMCN ensures its high stability in blood circulation and ideal tumor accumulation; exposure to acidic TME reverses its surface charge to positive, enhancing tumor penetration and locally releasing DMC. Upon near&#8208;infrared photoirradiation, SPDMCN generates singlet oxygen to ablate tumors and promote maturation of dendritic cells. Released DMC inhibits protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A) activity and decreases Tregs differentiation. Such combinational action induces a sharp increase in CTL/Treg ratio in TME and effectively inhibits both primary and distant tumors in living mice.

         <title>An Adjacent Atomic Platinum Site Enables Single&#8208;Atom Iron with High Oxygen Reduction Reaction Performance</title>

We have designed an efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalyst of Fe&#8208;N4/Pt&#8208;N4@NC with Fe&#8208;N4 and Pt&#8208;N4 dual atomic sites. The enhancement for the ORR activity is demonstrated by the modulation effect: Pt&#8208;N4 plays the role in modulating the Fe&#8208;N4 active center to optimize the ORR performance. The modulation effect is not effective for the enhancement of ORR performance in the systems of Co&#8208;N4/Pt&#8208;N4@NC and Mn&#8208;N4/Pt&#8208;N4@NC.







Abstract
The modulation effect has been widely investigated to tune the electronic state of single&#8208;atomic M&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts to enhance the activity of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the in&#8208;depth study of modulation effect is rarely reported for the isolated dual&#8208;atomic metal sites. Now, the catalytic activities of Fe&#8208;N4 moiety can be enhanced by the adjacent Pt&#8208;N4 moiety through the modulation effect, in which the Pt&#8208;N4 acts as the modulator to tune the 3d electronic orbitals of Fe&#8208;N4 active site and optimize ORR activity. Inspired by this principle, we design and synthesize the electrocatalyst that comprises isolated Fe&#8208;N4/Pt&#8208;N4 moieties dispersed in the nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix (Fe&#8208;N4/Pt&#8208;N4@NC) and exhibits a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.93&#8197;V vs. RHE and negligible activity degradation (&#916;E1/2=8&#8197;mV) after 10000 cycles in 0.1&#8197;M KOH. We also demonstrate that the modulation effect is not effective for optimizing the ORR performances of Co&#8208;N4/Pt&#8208;N4 and Mn&#8208;N4/Pt&#8208;N4 systems.

         <title>Porous 2D and 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks with Dimensionality&#8208;Dependent Photocatalytic Activity in Promoting Radical Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization</title>

2D and 3D N,N&#8208;diaryl dihydrophenazine (PN)&#8208;based COFs are prepared and used as heterogeneous photocatalysts to promote radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization (RROP) of vinylcyclopropanes (VCPs). The 2D COFs had higher catalytic activity and showed dimensionality&#8208;dependent photocatalytic activity, allowing the efficient synthesis of poly(VCPs) with controlled molecular weight, low dispersity and high l/c selectivity (up to 97&#8201;%).







Abstract
Dimensionality is a fundamental parameter to modulate the properties of solid materials by tuning electronic structures. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a prominent class of porous crystalline materials, but the study of dimensional dependence on their physicochemical properties is still lacking. Herein we illustrate photocatalytic performances of N,N&#8208;diaryl dihydrophenazine (PN)&#8208;based COFs are heavily dependent on the structural dimensionality. Six isostructural imine&#8208;bonded 2D&#8208;PN COFs and one 3D&#8208;PN COF were prepared. All can be heterogeneous photocatalysts to promote radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization of vinylcyclopropanes (VCPs), which typically produces polymers with a combination of linear (l) and cyclic (c) repeat units. The 2D&#8208;PN COFs have much higher catalytic activity than the 3D&#8208;PN COF, allowing the efficient synthesis of poly(VCPs) with controlled molecular weight, low dispersity and high l/c selectivity (up to 97&#8201;%). The improved performance can be ascribed to the 2D structure which has a larger internal surface area, more catalytically active sites, higher photosensitizing ability and photoinduced electron transfer efficiency.

         <title>Beam Search for Automated Design and Scoring of Novel ROR Ligands with Machine Intelligence**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19477-19482, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The beam search algorithm was employed for automated molecule design and scoring from a chemical language model (CLM). Prospective application of this model&#8208;intrinsic technique with a CLM trained on inverse ROR&#947; agonists yielded novel ligands of this nuclear receptor with the intended bioactivity. Beam search sampling overcomes the need for external scoring methods and extends the applicability of machine learning&#8208;driven molecular design.







Abstract
Chemical language models enable de&#8197;novo drug design without the requirement for explicit molecular construction rules. While such models have been applied to generate novel compounds with desired bioactivity, the actual prioritization and selection of the most promising computational designs remains challenging. Herein, we leveraged the probabilities learnt by chemical language models with the beam search algorithm as a model&#8208;intrinsic technique for automated molecule design and scoring. Prospective application of this method yielded novel inverse agonists of retinoic acid receptor&#8208;related orphan receptors (RORs). Each design was synthesizable in three reaction steps and presented low&#8208;micromolar to nanomolar potency towards ROR&#947;. This model&#8208;intrinsic sampling technique eliminates the strict need for external compound scoring functions, thereby further extending the applicability of generative artificial intelligence to data&#8208;driven drug discovery.

         <title>Enabling Cysteine&#8208;Free Native Chemical Ligation at Challenging Junctions with a Ligation Auxiliary Capable of Base Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19483-19490, August 23, 2021. </description>

The MPyE group is the first sulfur based auxiliary enabling peptide ligation at proline and &#946;&#8208;branched amino acids. The pyridine nitrogen probably acts as a base that catalyzes the S&#8594;N acyl transfer during native chemical ligation.







Abstract
Ligation auxiliaries are used in chemical protein synthesis to extend the scope of native chemical ligation (NCL) beyond cysteine. However, auxiliary&#8208;mediated ligations at sterically demanding junctions have been difficult. Often the thioester intermediate formed in the thiol exchange step of NCL accumulates because the subsequent S&#8594;N acyl transfer is extremely slow. Here we introduce the 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethyl (MPyE) group as the first auxiliary designed to aid the ligation reaction by catalysis. Notably, the MPyE auxiliary provides useful rates even for junctions containing proline or a &#946;&#8208;branched amino acid. Quantum chemical calculations suggest that the pyridine nitrogen acts as an intramolecular base in a rate&#8208;determining proton transfer step. The auxiliary is prepared in two steps and conveniently introduced by reductive alkylation. Auxiliary cleavage is induced upon treatment with TCEP/morpholine in presence of a MnII complex as radical starter. The synthesis of a de novo designed 99mer peptide and an 80 aa long MUC1 peptide demonstrates the usefulness of the MPyE auxiliary.

Highly crystalline triazine&#8208;based carbon nitride quantum dots (c&#8208;CNQDs) with rich &#8208;COOH and &#8208;OH terminal groups are synthesized in large scale. Under proper irradiation, c&#8208;CNQDs undergo a unique gradual self&#8208;assembly and recrystallization process, initiated by photocatalytic cross&#8208;linking effect between &#8208;OH and &#8208;NH2 edge groups of neighboring QDs. Addition of electron scavengers can effectively suppress the assembling behavior.







Abstract
The study of nanocrystal self&#8208;assembly into superlattices or superstructures is of great significance in nanoscience. Carbon nitride quantum dots (CNQDs), being a promising new group of nanomaterials, however, have hardly been explored in their self&#8208;organizing behavior. Here we report of a unique irradiation&#8208;triggered self&#8208;assembly and recrystallization phenomenon of crystalline CNQDs (c&#8208;CNQDs) terminated by abundant oxygen&#8208;containing groups. Unlike the conventional self&#8208;assembly of nanocrystals into ordered superstructures, the photoinduced self&#8208;assembly of c&#8208;CNQDs resembles a &#8220;click reaction&#8221; process of macromolecules, in which the activated &#8208;OH and &#8208;NH2 functional groups along the perimeters initiate cross&#8208;linking of adjacent QDs through a photocatalytic effect. Our findings unveil fundamental physiochemical features of CNQDs and open up new possibilities of manipulating carbon nitride nanomaterials via controlled assembly. Prospects for potential applications are discussed as well.

         <title>A Chemiluminescent Tetraaryl Diborane(4) Tetraanion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19397-19405, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combination of boron doping with an antiaromaticity/aromaticity switch allowed the preparation of a unique diborane(4) tetraanion. Air oxidation leads to blue chemiluminescence, while controlled two&#8208;electron oxidation furnishes a dianionic diborene. The reactivities of the compounds are characterized by boron&#8208;centered nucleophilicity, C&#8722;H activation, single electron transfers, and Stone&#8211;Wales&#8208;type rearrangements.







Abstract
Two subvalent, redox&#8208;active diborane(4) anions, [3]4&#8722; and [3]2&#8722;, carrying exceptionally high negative charge densities are reported: Reduction of 9&#8208;methoxy&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene with Li granules without stirring leads to the crystallization of the B(sp3)&#8722;B(sp2) diborane(5) anion salt Li[5]. [5]&#8722; contains a 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biphenyldiyl&#8208;bridged B&#8722;B core, a chelating 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biphenyldiyl moiety, and a MeO substituent. Reduction of Li[5] with Na metal gives the Na+ salt of the tetraanion [3]4&#8722; in which two doubly reduced 9&#8208;borafluorenyl fragments are linked via a B&#8722;B single bond. Comproportionation of Li[5] and Na4[3] quantitatively furnishes the diborane(4) dianion salt Na2[3], the doubly boron&#8208;doped congener of 9,9&#8242;&#8208;bis(fluorenylidene). Under acid catalysis, Na2[3] undergoes a formal Stone&#8211;Wales rearrangement to yield a dibenzo[g,p]chrysene derivative with B=B core. Na2[3] shows boron&#8208;centered nucleophilicity toward n&#8208;butyl chloride. Na4[3] produces bright blue chemiluminescence when exposed to air.

&lt;p&gt;Combination of boron doping with an antiaromaticity/aromaticity switch allowed the preparation of a unique diborane(4) tetraanion. Air oxidation leads to blue chemiluminescence, while controlled two-electron oxidation furnishes a dianionic diborene. The reactivities of the compounds are characterized by boron-centered nucleophilicity, C&#8722;H activation, single electron transfers, and Stone&#8211;Wales-type rearrangements.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two subvalent, redox-active diborane(4) anions, [&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and [&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, carrying exceptionally high negative charge densities are reported: Reduction of 9-methoxy-9-borafluorene with Li granules without stirring leads to the crystallization of the B(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;B(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) diborane(5) anion salt Li[&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;]. [&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; contains a 2,2&#8242;-biphenyldiyl-bridged B&#8722;B core, a chelating 2,2&#8242;-biphenyldiyl moiety, and a MeO substituent. Reduction of Li[&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;] with Na metal gives the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; salt of the tetraanion [&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in which two doubly reduced 9-borafluorenyl fragments are linked via a B&#8722;B single bond. Comproportionation of Li[&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;] and Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;] quantitatively furnishes the diborane(4) dianion salt Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;], the doubly boron-doped congener of 9,9&#8242;-bis(fluorenylidene). Under acid catalysis, Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;] undergoes a formal Stone&#8211;Wales rearrangement to yield a dibenzo[g,p]chrysene derivative with B=B core. Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;] shows boron-centered nucleophilicity toward n-butyl chloride. Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;] produces bright blue chemiluminescence when exposed to air.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Highly Enantioselective Iridium(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrocarbonation of Alkenes: A Versatile Approach to Heterocyclic Systems Bearing Quaternary Stereocenters</title>

We report an enantioselective Ir&#8208;catalyzed hydrocarbonation towards pyrrole and indole polycyclic scaffolds featuring five&#8208;, six&#8208; or seven&#8208;membered rings, with tertiary and all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters. The process can be coupled with the desymmetrization of prochiral centers to obtain pyrrole&#8208; and indole&#8208;fused scaffolds with either vicinal or skipped stereocenters. DFT studies shed light on the mechanism and key stereodetermining factors.







Abstract
We report a versatile, highly enantioselective intramolecular hydrocarbonation reaction that provides a direct access to heteropolycyclic systems bearing chiral quaternary carbon stereocenters. The method, which relies on an iridium(I)/bisphosphine chiral catalyst, is particularly efficient for the synthesis of five&#8208;, six&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered fused indole and pyrrole products, bearing one and two stereocenters, with enantiomeric excesses of up to &gt;99&#8201;%. DFT computational studies allowed to obtain a detailed mechanistic profile and identify a cluster of weak non&#8208;covalent interactions as key factors to control the enantioselectivity.

         <title>Integration of Bimetallic Electronic Synergy with Oxide Site Isolation Improves the Selective Hydrogenation of Acetylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19324-19330, August 23, 2021. </description>

A Ga2O3 coating of Ag@Pd core&#8211;shell bimetallic nanoparticle catalyst improves the ethylene selectivity compared with a coated Pd monometallic catalyst. The intrinsic activity is preserved and is approximately 50 times higher than the benchmark Pd1Ag single&#8208;atom alloy catalysts.







Abstract
Semi&#8208;hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene is an important process to purify ethylene streams in industry. However, among current approaches reported in the literature, high ethylene selectivity has been generally achieved at the expense of activity. Herein, we show that a Ga2O3 coating of Ag@Pd core&#8211;shell bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts, allows improvement of the ethylene selectivity to a much greater extent than the coating of monometallic Pd nanoparticles, while preserving a remarkable intrinsic activity, approximately 50 times higher than the benchmark catalyst of Pd1Ag single&#8208;atom alloys (SAAs). Importantly, the resulting catalyst also shows excellent long&#8208;term stability, by suppressing coke formation efficiently. Spectroscopic characterization reveals that weakened ethylene adsorption by bimetallic electronic synergy, and oxide site isolation are both essential for the high ethylene selectivity and high&#8208;coking resistance. H&#8208;D exchange measurements further show that the Ga2O3&#8208;coated Ag@Pd catalyst possesses a much higher activity of H2 activation than that of Pd1Ag SAAs, thus boosting the hydrogenation activity at the same time.

         <title>Materials Engineering of Violin Soundboards by Stradivari and Guarneri</title>

ICP&#8208;MS is used to identify the unique mineral recipe used by Antonio Stradivari to treat his spruce wood, the material for the violin top plate. Chemical manipulation led to hemicellulose fragmentation and cellulose rearrangement. Incorporating engineered wood may contribute to the unique tonal qualities of these acclaimed instruments.







Abstract
We investigated the material properties of Cremonese soundboards using a wide range of spectroscopic, microscopic, and chemical techniques. We found similar types of spruce in Cremonese soundboards as in modern instruments, but Cremonese spruces exhibit unnatural elemental compositions and oxidation patterns that suggest artificial manipulation. Combining analytical data and historical information, we may deduce the minerals being added and their potential functions&#8212;borax and metal sulfates for fungal suppression, table salt for moisture control, alum for molecular crosslinking, and potash or quicklime for alkaline treatment. The overall purpose may have been wood preservation or acoustic tuning. Hemicellulose fragmentation and altered cellulose nanostructures are observed in heavily treated Stradivari specimens, which show diminished second&#8208;harmonic generation signals. Guarneri's practice of crosslinking wood fibers via aluminum coordination may also affect mechanical and acoustic properties. Our data suggest that old masters undertook materials engineering experiments to produce soundboards with unique properties.

         <title>Enabling Lithium Metal Anode in Nonflammable Phosphate Electrolyte with Electrochemically Induced Chemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19183-19190, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A critical challenge toward realizing Li metal anode has been the lack of stable SEI between Li and the electrolyte. We report an approach of using oxygen to induce unique decompositions of organic phosphate solvent, where simple reactions favor the formation of a stable SEI. This method permits repeated Li stripping/plating on Li metal in a flame retardant electrolyte. The results promise safe operations of Li in next generation batteries.







Abstract
Lithium metal anode holds great promises for next&#8208;generation battery technologies but is notoriously difficult to work with. The key to solving this challenge is believed to lie in the ability of forming stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers. To further address potential safety issues, it is critical to achieve this goal in nonflammable electrolytes. Building upon previous successes in forming stable SEI in conventional carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes, here we report that reversible Li stripping/plating could be realized in triethyl phosphate (TEP), a known flame retardant. The critical enabling factor of our approach was the introduction of oxygen, which upon electrochemical reduction induces the initial decomposition of TEP and produces Li3PO4 and poly&#8208;phosphates. Importantly, the reaction was self&#8208;limiting, and the resulting material regulated Li plating by limiting dendrite formation. In effect, we obtained a functional SEI on Li metal in a nonflammable electrolyte. When tested in a symmetric Li&#8741;Li cell, more than 300&#8197;cycles of stripping/plating were measured at a current density of 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Prototypical Li&#8208;O2 and Li&#8208;ion batteries were also fabricated and tested to further support the effectiveness of this strategy. The mechanism by which the SEI forms was studied by density functional theory (DFT), and the predictions were corroborated by the successful detection of the intermediates and products.

         <title>Halogen Bonding Tetraphenylethene Anion Receptors: Anion&#8208;Induced Emissive Aggregates and Photoswitchable Recognition</title>

A series of halogen bonding (XB) tetraphenylethene (TPE) based anion receptors are reported. The receptors exhibit a remarkable anion&#8208;induced turn&#8208;on luminescence response, in which halogen bonding anion interactions drive the formation of emissive nanoscale aggregates. Disubstituted XB TPE derivatives function as photoswitchable anion receptors, in which modulation of photostationary states is intimately related to anion affinity.







Abstract
A series of tetraphenylethene (TPE) derivatives functionalized with highly potent electron&#8208;deficient perfluoroaryl iodo&#8208;triazole halogen bond (XB) donors for anion recognition are reported. 1H&#8197;NMR titration experiments, fluorescence spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering measurements, TEM imaging and X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis reveal that the tetra&#8208;substituted halogen bonding receptor forms luminescent nanoscale aggregates, the formation of which is driven by XB&#8208;mediated anion coordination. This anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;induced aggregation effect serves as a powerful sensory mechanism, capable of luminescence chloride sensing at parts per billion concentration. Furthermore, the doubly substituted geometric isomers act as unprecedented photoswitchable XB donor anion receptors, where the composition of the photostationary state can be modulated by the presence of a coordinating halide anion.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Complex N&#8208;Glycans of the Parasite S. mansoni to Examine the Importance of Epitope Presentation on DC&#8208;SIGN recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19287-19296, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular recognition of chemoenzymatically synthesized glycans derived from the parasitic worm S. mansoni by the human lectin DC&#8208;SIGN was investigated by a combination of NMR, computational and electron microscopy. It uncovered the importance of glycan complexity for lectin recognition including the influence of glycan valency, core xylosylation and length of oligo&#8208;LacNAc residues.







Abstract
The importance of multivalency for N&#8208;glycan&#8208;protein interactions has primarily been studied by attachment of minimal epitopes to artificial multivalent scaffold and not in the context of multi&#8208;antennary glycans. N&#8208;glycans can be modified by bisecting GlcNAc, core xylosides and fucosides, and extended N&#8208;acetyl lactosamine moieties. The impact of such modifications on glycan recognition are also not well understood. We describe here a chemoenzymatic methodology that can provide N&#8208;glycans expressed by the parasitic worm S. mansoni having unique epitopes at each antenna and containing core xyloside. NMR, computational and electron microscopy were employed to investigate recognition of the glycans by the human lectin DC&#8208;SIGN. It revealed that core xyloside does not influence terminal epitope recognition. The multi&#8208;antennary glycans bound with higher affinity to DC&#8208;SIGN compared to mono&#8208;valent counterparts, which was attributed to proximity&#8208;induced effective concentration. The multi&#8208;antennary glycans cross&#8208;linked DC&#8208;SIGN into a dense network, which likely is relevant for antigen uptake and intracellular routing.

         <title>Synergistic Lysozyme&#8208;Photodynamic Therapy Against Resistant Bacteria based on an Intelligent Upconversion Nanoplatform</title>

A nanohybrid UCMB&#8208;LYZ&#8208;HP was designed with features of intelligently bacteria&#8208;responsive release of lysozyme and NIR&#8208;triggered high production of 1O2. By synergistically combining the enzymatic and photodynamic effect, the nanohybrid exhibited an extraordinary antibacterial capacity both in vitro and in vivo, providing a promising strategy for combating deep&#8208;tissue infections caused by resistant bacteria.







Abstract
The rapid emergence of drug&#8208;resistant bacteria has raised a great social concern together with the impetus for exploring advanced antibacterial ways. NIR&#8208;triggered antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (PDT) by lanthanide&#8208;doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNP) as energy donor exhibits the advantages of high tissue penetration, broad antibacterial spectrum and less acquired resistance, but is still limited by its low efficacy. Now we designed a bio&#8208;inorganic nanohybrid and combined lysozyme (LYZ) with UCNP&#8208;PDT system to enhance the efficiency against resistant bacteria. Benefiting from the rapid adhesion to bacteria, intelligently bacteria&#8208;responsive LYZ release and synergistic LYZ&#8208;PDT effect, the nanoplatform achieves an exceptionally strong bactericidal capacity and conspicuous bacteriostasis on methicillin&#8208;resistant S. aureus. These findings pave the way for designing efficiently antibacterial nanomaterials and provide a new strategy for combating deep&#8208;tissue bacterial infection.

tert&#8208;Butoxide unlocks divergent reactivity embedded in nitrostilbenes to construct N&#8208;hydroxyindoles or oxindoles depending on whether sodium or potassium is the counterion.







Abstract
tert&#8208;Butoxide unlocks new reactivity patterns embedded in nitroarenes. Exposure of nitrostilbenes to sodium tert&#8208;butoxide was found to produce N&#8208;hydroxyindoles at room temperature without an additive. Changing the counterion to potassium changed the reaction outcome to yield solely oxindoles through an unprecedented dioxygen&#8208;transfer reaction followed by a 1,2&#8208;phenyl migration. Mechanistic experiments established that these reactions proceed via radical intermediates and suggest that counterion coordination controls whether an oxindole or N&#8208;hydroxyindole product is formed.

         <title>Regulation of SEI Formation by Anion Receptors to Achieve Ultra&#8208;Stable Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19232-19240, August 23, 2021. </description>

A small amount of TMSB molecules are found to effectively optimize SEI via EDL structure regulation. Their preferable adsorption on the Li&#8208;metal surface and their attraction to PF6&#8722; ions result in a high&#8208;local ion concentration in the EDL region, thus forming an inorganic&#8208;rich SEI and demonstrating superior performance.







Abstract
Despite high specific capacity (3860&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), the utilization of Li&#8208;metal anodes in rechargeable batteries are still hampered due to their insufficient cyclability. Herein, we report an anion&#8208;receptor&#8208;mediated carbonate electrolyte with improved performance and can ameliorate the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) composition comparing to the blank electrolyte. It demonstrates a high average Coulombic efficiency (97.94&#8201;%) over 500 cycles in the Li/Cu cell at a capacity of 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Raman spectrum and molecular modelling further clarify the screening effects of the anion receptor on the Li+&#8208;PF6&#8722; ion coupling that results in the enhanced ion dynamics. The X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) distinguishes the disparities in the SEI components of the developed electrolyte and the blank one, which is rationalized by the molecular insights of the Li&#8208;metal/electrolyte interface. Thus, we prepare a 2.5&#8197;Ah prototype pouch cell, exhibiting a high energy density (357&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) with 90.90&#8201;% capacity retention over 50 cycles.

&lt;p&gt;Despite high specific capacity (3860&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), the utilization of Li-metal anodes in rechargeable batteries are still hampered due to their insufficient cyclability. Herein, we report an anion-receptor-mediated carbonate electrolyte with improved performance and can ameliorate the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) composition comparing to the blank electrolyte. It demonstrates a high average Coulombic efficiency (97.94&#8201;%) over 500 cycles in the Li/Cu cell at a capacity of 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Raman spectrum and molecular modelling further clarify the screening effects of the anion receptor on the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ion coupling that results in the enhanced ion dynamics. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) distinguishes the disparities in the SEI components of the developed electrolyte and the blank one, which is rationalized by the molecular insights of the Li-metal/electrolyte interface. Thus, we prepare a 2.5&#8197;Ah prototype pouch cell, exhibiting a high energy density (357&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) with 90.90&#8201;% capacity retention over 50 cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Site&#8208; and Enantioselective Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetric Mono&#8208;Hydrogenation of 1,4&#8208;Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19428-19434, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient site&#8208;selective desymmetric mono&#8208;hydrogenation of 1,4&#8208;dienes is reported. This protocol allows rapid access to a wide range of chiral allylic alcohols and amides bearing two vicinal chiral centers adjacent to the alkene. The utility of this method is further highlighted by the synthesis of the alkyl side chain of zaragozic acid&#8197;A and the formal total synthesis of (+)&#8208;invictolide.







Abstract
The control of site selectivity in asymmetric mono&#8208;hydrogenation of dienes or polyenes remains largely underdeveloped. Herein, we present a highly efficient desymmetrization of 1,4&#8208;dienes via iridium&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208; and enantioselective hydrogenation. This methodology demonstrates the first iridium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenative desymmetriation of meso dienes and provides a concise approach to the installation of two vicinal stereogenic centers adjacent to an alkene. High isolated yields (up to 96&#8201;%) and excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to 99:1&#8197;d.r. and 99&#8201;%&#8197;ee) were obtained for a series of divinyl carbinol and divinyl carbinamide substrates. DFT calculations reveal that an interaction between the hydroxy oxygen and the reacting hydride is responsible for the stereoselectivity of the desymmetrization of the divinyl carbinol. Based on the calculated energy profiles, a model that simulates product distribution over time was applied to show an intuitive kinetics of this process. The usefulness of the methodology was demonstrated by the synthesis of the key intermediates of natural products zaragozic acid&#8197;A and (+)&#8208;invictolide.

         <title>Switching from Single to Simultaneous Free&#8208;Radical and Anionic Polymerization with Enamine&#8208;Based Organic Electron Donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19389-19396, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic electron donors (OEDs) act as dual&#8208;mode activators priming concomitant radical and anionic polymerizations to prepare interpenetrating polymer networks. OEDs can simultaneously reduce an oxidant to initiate a radical propagation and reduce a monomer to initiate an anionic propagation. These light&#8208;, metal&#8208;, and peroxide&#8208;free redox systems open new horizons for the development of macromolecular architectures through dual chain&#8208;growth modes.







Abstract
Although most monomers can polymerize through different propagation pathways, polymerization&#8208;initiating systems that can switch from one mode to another are rare. In this study, we demonstrate that enamine&#8208;based organic electron donors (OEDs) constitute the first systems able to initiate either free&#8208;radical or anionic polymerization under simple, mild, and safe conditions. While direct electron&#8208;transfer reduction of monomers by OEDs results in the initiation of anionic chain&#8208;growth polymerization, introduction of a competing oxidant with a higher reduction potential than the monomer switches the former anionic propagation to a clean radical&#8208;propagation process. The benefit of this dual&#8208;mode activator is highlighted in the synthesis of an interpenetrating polymer network through simultaneous initiation of radical and anionic propagation processes.

We integrate a compact, reconfigurable reaction cell featuring electrochemical functionality with high&#8208;resolution NMR spectroscopy. This system is used to monitor the activity of enzymes immobilized in chemically distinct layers within a multi&#8208;layered chitosan hydrogel assembly. We observed the parallel activities of urease, catalase, and glucose oxidase by monitoring reagent and product concentrations in real&#8208;time.







Abstract
Compartmentalized chemical reactions at the microscale are important in biotechnology, yet monitoring the molecular content at these small scales is challenging. To address this challenge, we integrate a compact, reconfigurable reaction cell featuring electrochemical functionality with high&#8208;resolution NMR spectroscopy. We demonstrate the operation of this system by monitoring the activity of enzymes immobilized in chemically distinct layers within a multi&#8208;layered chitosan hydrogel assembly. As a benchmark, we observed the parallel activities of urease (Urs), catalase (Cat), and glucose oxidase (GOx) by monitoring reagent and product concentrations in real&#8208;time. Simultaneous monitoring of an independent enzymatic process (Urs) together with a cooperative process (GOx + Cat) was achieved, with chemical conversion modulation of the GOx + Cat process demonstrated by varying the order in which the hydrogel was assembled.

Versatile one&#8208;pot synthesis of functionalized core&#8211;shell nanowires breaks through the limitation of nanoelectrode materials to facilely construct high&#8208;performance single nanowire electrodes. Concurrently with excellent electrochemical, mechanical, and antifouling properties, the nanowire electrodes show great superiority in real&#8208;time monitoring of biological molecules and unraveling the relevant signaling pathway inside single living cells.







Abstract
A strategy for one&#8208;pot and large&#8208;scale synthesis of functionalized core&#8211;shell nanowires (NWs) to high&#8208;efficiently construct single nanowire electrodes is proposed. Based on the polymerization reaction between 3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) and noble metal cations, manifold noble metal nanoparticles&#8208;polyEDOT (PEDOT) nanocomposites can be uniformly modified on the surface of any nonconductive NWs. This provides a facile and versatile approach to produce massive number of core&#8211;shell NWs with excellent conductivity, adjustable size, and well&#8208;designed properties. Nanoelectrodes manufactured with such core&#8211;shell NWs exhibit excellent electrochemical performance and mechanical stability as well as favorable antifouling properties, which are demonstrated by in situ intracellular monitoring of biological molecules (nitric oxide) and unraveling its relevant unclear signaling pathway inside single living cells.

The expansion of TBPZ acceptor plane well&#8208;controlled the excited states involving 1CT, 3CT and 3LE states, which enhances the kRISC by remarkably shortening &#964;d and induced a completely horizontal orientation of the TDM. Consequently, PQ3 displayed an orange red EL max at 586&#8197;nm, PLQY of ca. 83&#8201;%, kRISC of 8&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1, &#964;d of 2.7&#8197;&#956;s, S values of &#8722;0.49, and deliver high EQE of 27.4&#8201;%.







Abstract
Three thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules, namely PQ1, PQ2, and PQ3, are composed of electron&#8208;accepting (A) tetrabenzo[a,c]phenazine (TBPZ) and electron&#8208;donating (D) phenoxazine (PXZ) units are designed and characterized. The combined effects of planar acceptor manipulation and high steric hindrance between D and A units endow high molecular rigidity that suppresses nonradiative decay of the excitons with improved photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs). Particularly, the well&#8208;aligned excited states involving a singlet and a triplet charge&#8208;transfer excited states and a localized excited triplet state in PQ3 enhances the reverse intersystem crossing rate constant (kRISC) with a short delay lifetime (&#964;d). The orange&#8211;red OLED based on PQ3 displays a maximum external EL quantum efficiency (EQE) of 27.4&#8201;% with a well&#8208;suppressed EL efficiency roll&#8208;off owing to a completely horizontal orientation of the transition dipole moment in the film state.

         <title>From Kinase Inhibitors to Multitarget Ligands as Powerful Drug Leads for Alzheimer's Disease using Protein&#8208;Templated Synthesis</title>

Using different small molecules targeting protein kinases and BACE1 templated synthesis, we have obtained well&#8208;balanced multitarget compounds. They have three different biological activities and may be a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of complex diseases such as AD.







Abstract
Multitarget directed ligands (MTDLs) are arising as promising tools to tackle complex diseases. The main goal of this work is to create powerful modulating agents for neurodegenerative disorders. To achieve this aim, we have combined fragments that inhibit key protein kinases involved in the main pathomolecular pathways of Alzheimer's disease (AD) such as tau aggregation, neuroinflammation and decreased neurogenesis, whilst looking for a third action in beta&#8208;secretase (BACE1), responsible of &#946;&#8208;amyloid production. We obtained well&#8208;balanced MTDLs with in vitro activity in three different relevant targets and efficacy in two cellular models of AD. Furthermore, computational studies confirmed how these compounds accommodate adequately into the long and rather narrow BACE1 catalytic site. Finally, we employed in situ click chemistry using BACE1 as protein template as a versatile synthetic tool that allowed us to obtain further MTDLs.

         <title>Heteroaromatic Hyperbranched Polyelectrolytes: Multicomponent Polyannulation and Photodynamic Biopatterning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19222-19231, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multicomponent polymerization for the efficient synthesis of heteroaromatic hyperbranched polyelectrolytes was developed. These hyperbranched polymers showed excellent solubility, high quantum yields, tunable emission, and strong ROS generation ability, allowing for their widespread applications in highly ordered fluorescent photopatterning, efficient bacterial killing, and customizable photodynamic patterning of living organisms.







Abstract
We reported an efficient multicomponent polyannulation for in situ generation of heteroaromatic hyperbranched polyelectrolytes by using readily accessible internal diynes and low&#8208;cost, commercially available arylnitriles, NaSbF6, and H2O/AcOH. The polymers were obtained in excellent yields (up to 99&#8201;%) with extraordinary high molecular weights (Mw up to 1.011&#215;106) and low polydispersity indices. The resulting polymers showed good processibility and high quantum yields with tunable emission in the solid state, making them ideal materials for highly ordered fluorescent photopatterning. These hyperbranched polyelectrolytes also possessed strong ability to generate reactive oxygen species, which allowed their applications in efficient bacterial killing and customizable photodynamic patterning of living organisms in a simple and cost&#8208;effective way.

         <title>Precise Control of Both Dispersity and Molecular Weight Distribution Shape by Polymer Blending</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19383-19388, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tuning dispersity and molecular weight distribution shape significantly impacts polymer properties. Herein, we report a straight&#8208;forward approach, wherein blending just two polymers allows for unrivalled precision in tuning molecular weight distributions.







Abstract
The breadth and the shape of molecular weight distributions can significantly influence fundamental polymer properties that are critical for various applications. However, current approaches require the extensive synthesis of multiple polymers, are limited in dispersity precision and are typically incapable of simultaneously controlling both the dispersity and the shape of molecular weight distributions. Here we report a simplified approach, whereby on mixing two polymers (one of high &#272; and one of low &#272;), any intermediate dispersity value can be obtained (e.g. from 1.08 to 1.84). Unrivalled precision is achieved, with dispersity values obtained to even the nearest 0.01 (e.g. 1.37&#8594;1.38&#8594;1.39&#8594;1.40&#8594;1.41&#8594;1.42&#8594;1.43&#8594;1.44&#8594;1.45), while maintaining fairly monomodal molecular weight distributions. This approach was also employed to control the shape of molecular weight distributions and to obtain diblock copolymers with high dispersity accuracy. The straightforward nature of our methodology alongside its compatibility with a wide range of polymerisation protocols (e.g. ATRP, RAFT), significantly expands the toolbox of tailored polymeric materials and makes them accessible to all researchers.

         <title>Synergetic Metal Defect and Surface Chemical Reconstruction into NiCo2S4/ZnS Heterojunction to Achieve Outstanding Oxygen Evolution Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19435-19441, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The NiCo2S4/ZnS hybrid catalyst with abundant Zn defects exhibits an outstanding OER performance, demonstrated by an ultralow overpotential of 140&#8197;mV. DFT calculations reveal that the built&#8208;in interfacial potential and Zn defects can facilitate the thermodynamic formation of *O to *OOH, thus improving the intrinsic catalytic performance. This study provides a simple strategy for the construction of heterojunctions with defects.







Abstract
Defect and interface engineering are recognized as effective strategies to regulate electronic structure and improve activity of metal sulfide. However, the practical application of sulfide is restricted by their low conductivity and rapid decline in activity derived from large volume fluctuation during electrocatalysis process. More importantly, the determination of exact active site of sulfide is complicated due to the inevitable electrochemical reconstruction. Herein, ZnS nanoparticles with Zn defect are anchored onto the surface of NiCo2S4 nanosheet to construct NiCo2S4/ZnS hybrids, which exhibit outstanding oxygen evolution performance with an ultralow overpotential of 140&#8197;mV. The anchoring of defective ZnS nanoparticles inhibit the volume expansion of NiCo2S4 nanosheet during the cycling process. Density&#8208;functional theory reveals that the build&#8208;in interfacial potential and Zn defect can facilitate the thermodynamic formation of *O to *OOH, thus improve their intrinsic activity.

         <title>Record Productivity and Unprecedented Molecular Weight for Ring&#8208;Opening Copolymerization of Epoxides and Cyclic Anhydrides Enabled by Organoboron Catalysts</title>

Ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of epoxides and cyclic anhydrides by organoboron catalysts is presented. In view of their facile preparation and unprecedented performance (thermostability, reactivity, and productivity), the catalysts provided here hold promise in pushing ROCOP of epoxides with cyclic anhydrides to the industry line.







Abstract
Producing polyesters with high molecular weight (Mn) through ring&#8208;opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of epoxides with cyclic anhydrides remains a major challenge. Herein, we communicate a metal&#8208;free, highly active, and high thermoresistance system for the ROCOP of epoxides with cyclic anhydrides to prepare polyesters (13 examples). The organoboron catalysts can endure a reaction temperature as high as 180&#8201;&#176;C for the ROCOP of cyclohexane oxide (CHO) with phthalic anhydride (PA) without the observation of any side reactions. The average Mn of the produced poly(CHO&#8208;alt&#8208;PA) climbed to 94.5&#8197;kDa with low polydispersity (&#208;=1.19). Furthermore, an unprecedented turnover number of 9900, equivalent to an efficiency of 7.4&#8197;kg of polyester/g of catalyst, was achieved at a feed ratio of CHO/PA/catalyst=20000:10000:1 at 150&#8201;&#176;C. Kinetic studies, crystal structure analysis, 11B&#8197;NMR spectra, and DFT calculations provided mechanistic justification for the effectiveness of the catalyst system.

         <title>Editing Light Emission with Stable Crystalline Covalent Organic Frameworks via Wall Surface Perturbation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19419-19427, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topology&#8208;directed polymerization enables the construction of highly emissive stable covalent organic frameworks linked by hydrazone bond. Perturbation of pore wall surface site can tune the emission to achieve three primary colors of light, rendering the materials able to edit various emission colors by organizing different surface sites onto the pore wall.







Abstract
The ordered &#960; skeletons of covalent organic frameworks make them viable light&#8208;emitting materials but their limited tunability has precluded further implementation. Here we report the synthesis of hydrazone&#8208;linked frameworks which are stable in water, acid, and base, and demonstrate their utility as a platform for light emission. The polygonal backbone is designed to be luminescent and partially &#960; conjugated while the pore wall is docked with single atom or unit to induce resonance, hyperconjugation, and tautomerization effects. These effects can be transmitted to the backbone, so that the framework can emit three primary colors of light. The wall can be perturbated with multiple surface sites, rendering the material able to edit diverse emission colors in a predesignable and digital way. The systems show high activity, stability, tunability, and sensibility: a set of features attractive for light&#8208;emitting and sensing applications.

         <title>Insight into the Alkaline Stability of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Ammonium Groups for Anion&#8208;Exchange Polyelectrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19272-19280, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work systematically explores the alkaline stability and degradation mechanism of 24 representative N&#8208;heterocyclic ammonium groups and poly(aryl piperidinium)&#8208;based polyelectrolytes for anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), providing a clear guideline for design of highly stable anion&#8208;exchange membranes and ionomers. The structure&#8211;durability relationship between ammonium groups, anion&#8208;exchange polyelectrolytes, and AEMFCs was revealed.







Abstract
The alkaline stability of N&#8208;heterocyclic ammonium (NHA) groups is a critical topic in anion&#8208;exchange membranes (AEMs) and AEM fuel cells (AEMFCs). Here, we report a systematic study on the alkaline stability of 24 representative NHA groups at different hydration numbers (&#955;) at 80&#8201;&#176;C. The results elucidate that &#947;&#8208;substituted NHAs containing electron&#8208;donating groups display superior alkaline stability, while electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents are detrimental to durable NHAs. Density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory calculations and experimental results suggest that nucleophilic substitution is the dominant degradation pathway in NHAs, while Hofmann elimination is the primary degradation pathway for NHA&#8208;based AEMs. Different degradation pathways determine the alkaline stability of NHAs or NHA&#8208;based AEMs. AEMFC durability (from 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 to 3&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2) suggests that NHA&#8208;based AEMs are mainly subjected to Hofmann elimination under 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 current density for 1000&#8197;h, providing insights into the relationship between current density, &#955; value, and durability of NHA&#8208;based AEMs.

The RNA genome of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 contains 15 independently folded regulatory RNA elements. By NMR&#8208;based fragment screening, the RNA target space for small molecule binding, functional mapping and inhibition is defined.







Abstract
SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 contains a positive single&#8208;stranded RNA genome of approximately 30&#8201;000 nucleotides. Within this genome, 15 RNA elements were identified as conserved between SARS&#8208;CoV and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. By nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we previously determined that these elements fold independently, in line with data from in vivo and ex&#8208;vivo structural probing experiments. These elements contain non&#8208;base&#8208;paired regions that potentially harbor ligand&#8208;binding pockets. Here, we performed an NMR&#8208;based screening of a poised fragment library of 768 compounds for binding to these RNAs, employing three different 1H&#8208;based 1D NMR binding assays. The screening identified common as well as RNA&#8208;element specific hits. The results allow selection of the most promising of the 15 RNA elements as putative drug targets. Based on the identified hits, we derive key functional units and groups in ligands for effective targeting of the RNA of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

We have developed a multicatalytic approach for the one&#8208;pot production of (meth)acrylate monomers, allowing the formation of the corresponding (co)polymers from renewable feedstocks. This highly efficient strategy allowed us to perform multiple catalytic transformations in one pot, while bypassing several purification steps. This procedure can therefore minimize chemical waste, save time, and simplify practicalities.







Abstract
Shifting from petrochemical feedstocks to renewable resources can address some of the environmental issues associated with petrochemical extraction and make plastics production sustainable. Therefore, there is a growing interest in selective methods for transforming abundant renewable feedstocks into monomers suitable for polymer production. Reported herein are one&#8208;pot catalytic systems, that are active, productive, and selective under mild conditions for the synthesis of copolymers from renewable materials. Each system allows for anhydride formation, alcohol acylation and/or acid esterification, as well as polymerization of the formed (meth)acrylates, providing direct access to a new library of unique poly(meth)acrylates.

         <title>Current&#8208;Density Regulating Lithium Metal Directional Deposition for Long Cycle&#8208;Life Li Metal Batteries</title>

The structure of Li metal anode was designed, in which the CCA layer working as charge organizer was placed between the current collector and the anode. It makes the main Li depositional interface transfer to the anode/current collector interface from the anode/separator interface, which effectively protects the separate. Electrochemical characterization of the electrode in half and full cells was significantly improved.







Abstract
Uncontrolled dendrite formation in the high energy density of lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) may pose serious safety risks. While numerous studies have attempted to protect separators, these proposed methods fail to effectively inhibit upward dendrite growth that punctures through the separator. Here, we introduce a novel &#8220;orientated&#8208;growth&#8221; strategy that transfers the main depositional interface to the anode/current collector interface from the anode/separator interface. We placed a layer of cellulose/graphene carbon composite aerogel (CCA) between the current collector and the anode (LCL&#8208;bottom). This layer works as a charge organizer that induces a high current density and encourages Li to deposit at the anode/current collector interface. Both in situ and ex situ images of the electrode demonstrate that the anode part of the cell has been flipped; with the newly deposited particles facing the current collector and the smooth surface facing the separator. The electrode in half and full cells showed outstanding cyclic stability and rate capability, with the LCL&#8208;bottom/LFP full cell capable of maintaining 94&#8201;% of its initial capacity after 1000&#8197;cycles.

Aldoxime dehydratases are able to enantioselectively dehydrate E&#8208; and Z&#8208;aldoximes to give the opposite enantiomeric forms of a chiral nitrile. This stereochemical phenomenon has been rationalized by means of molecular modelling. When calculated enzyme mutants with modified active sites were prepared and used in biotransformations, they showed the theoretically predicted change in enantioselectivity in these nitrile syntheses.







Abstract
In this contribution, the unique and unprecedented stereochemical phenomenon of an aldoxime dehydratase&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective dehydration of racemic E&#8208; and Z&#8208;aldoximes with selective formation of both enantiomeric forms of a chiral nitrile is rationalized by means of molecular modelling, comprising in silico mutations and docking studies. This theoretical investigation gave detailed insight into why with the same enzyme the use of racemic E&#8208; and Z&#8208;aldoximes leads to opposite forms of the chiral nitrile. The calculated mutants with a larger or smaller cavity in the active site were then prepared and used in biotransformations, showing the theoretically predicted decrease and increase of the enantioselectivities in these nitrile syntheses. This validated model also enabled the rational design of mutants with a smaller cavity, which gave superior enantioselectivities compared to the known wild&#8208;type enzyme, with excellent E&#8208;values of up to E&gt;200 when the mutant OxdRE&#8208;Leu145Phe was utilized.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Ladder&#8208;Type Heteroheptacene&#8208;Based Nonfullerene Acceptors Enabled by Asymmetric Cores with Enhanced Noncovalent Intramolecular Interactions</title>

Selenophene end&#8208;capped asymmetric heteroheptacene core is used to construct an efficient nonfullerene acceptor (MQ6) which shows increased carrier transport due to the enhanced O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se intramolecular noncovalent interaction as well as the increased dipole moment. MQ6 exhibits an outstanding efficiency of 16.39&#8201;% when blended with a wide band gap copolymer.







Abstract
Nonfullerene acceptors (MQ3, MQ5, MQ6) are synthesized using asymmetric and symmetric ladder&#8208;type heteroheptacene cores with selenophene heterocycles. Although MQ3 and MQ5 are constructed with the same number of selenophene heterocycles, the heteroheptacene core of MQ5 is end&#8208;capped with selenophene rings while that of MQ3 is flanked with thiophene rings. With the enhanced noncovalent interaction of O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se compared to that of O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S, MQ5 shows a bathochromically shifted absorption band and greatly improved carrier transport, leading to a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.64&#8201;% compared to MQ3, which shows a PCE of 13.51&#8201;%. Based on the asymmetric heteroheptacene core, MQ6 shows an improved carrier transport induced by the reduced &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance, related with the increased dipole moment in comparison with the nonfullerene acceptors based on symmetric cores. MQ6 exhibits a PCE of 16.39&#8201;% with a VOC of 0.88&#8197;V, a FF of 75.66&#8201;%, and a JSC of 24.62&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

Abstract
A dissymmetric backbone and selenophene substitution on the central core was used for the synthesis of symmetric or dissymmetric A&#8208;DA&#8242;D&#8208;A type non&#8208;fullerene small molecular acceptors (NF&#8208;SMAs) with different numbers of selenophene. From S&#8208;YSS&#8208;Cl to A&#8208;WSSe&#8208;Cl and to S&#8208;WSeSe&#8208;Cl, a gradually red&#8208;shifted absorption and a gradually larger electron mobility and crystallinity in neat thin film was observed. A&#8208;WSSe&#8208;Cl and S&#8208;WSeSe&#8208;Cl exhibit stronger and tighter intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions, extra S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N non&#8208;covalent intermolecular interactions from central benzothiadiazole, better ordered 3D interpenetrating charge&#8208;transfer networks in comparison with thiophene&#8208;based S&#8208;YSS&#8208;Cl. The dissymmetric A&#8208;WSSe&#8208;Cl&#8208;based device has a PCE of 17.51&#8201;%, which is the highest value for selenophene&#8208;based NF&#8208;SMAs in binary polymer solar cells. The combination of dissymmetric core and precise replacement of selenophene on the central core is effective to improve Jsc and FF without sacrificing Voc.

From &lt;b&gt;S-YSS-Cl&lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt;A-WSSe-Cl&lt;/b&gt; and to &lt;b&gt;S-WSeSe-Cl&lt;/b&gt;, a gradually red-shifted absorption and a gradually larger electron mobility and crystallinity in neat thin film was observed. &lt;b&gt;A-WSSe-Cl&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;S-WSeSe-Cl&lt;/b&gt; exhibit stronger and tighter intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions, extra S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N non-covalent intermolecular interactions from central benzothiadiazole, better ordered 3D interpenetrating charge-transfer networks in comparison with thiophene-based &lt;b&gt;S-YSS-Cl&lt;/b&gt;. The dissymmetric &lt;b&gt;A-WSSe-Cl&lt;/b&gt;-based device has a PCE of 17.51&#8201;%, which is the highest value for selenophene-based NF-SMAs in binary polymer solar cells. The combination of dissymmetric core and precise replacement of selenophene on the central core is effective to improve &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;sc&lt;/sub&gt; and FF without sacrificing &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Identifying Structure&#8211;Selectivity Correlations in the Electrochemical Reduction of CO2: A Comparison of Well&#8208;Ordered Atomically Clean and Chemically Etched Copper Single&#8208;Crystal Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19169-19175, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Subtle changes in the preparation of well&#8208;oriented Cu(100) and Cu(111) single&#8208;crystal surfaces affect their CO2RR selectivity. Clean, flat, atomically ordered surfaces are predicted to yield hydrocarbons; but these actually favor production of H2. Only when roughness and defects are introduced, significant amounts of hydrocarbons are generated. Structural and morphological effects are the key factors determining the catalytic selectivity of CO2RR.







Abstract
The identification of the active sites for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) to specific chemical products is elusive, owing in part to insufficient data gathered on clean and atomically well&#8208;ordered electrode surfaces. Here, ultrahigh vacuum based preparation methods and surface science characterization techniques are used with gas chromatography to demonstrate that subtle changes in the preparation of well&#8208;oriented Cu(100) and Cu(111) single&#8208;crystal surfaces drastically affect their CO2RR selectivity. Copper single crystals with clean, flat, and atomically ordered surfaces are predicted to yield hydrocarbons; however, these were found experimentally to favor the production of H2. Only when roughness and defects are introduced, for example by electrochemical etching or a plasma treatment, are significant amounts of hydrocarbons generated. These results show that structural and morphological effects are the key factors determining the catalytic selectivity of CO2RR.

         <title>Chalcogen&#8208;Bonding Catalysis with Telluronium Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19281-19286, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
New telluronium salts exhibit enhanced properties due to the presence of 3 &#963;&#8208;holes. This is highlighted in solution by Ph3PO&#8208;binding studies through 17O, 31P, and 125Te NMR as well as mass spectrometry and NOESY NMR. The enhanced chalcogen&#8208;bonding properties translated into high catalytic performance, with low loadings (0.5&#8211;5&#8197;mol&#8201;%), short reaction times (5&#8197;min&#8211;2&#8197;h), and high yields.







Abstract
Chalcogen bonding results from non&#8208;covalent interactions occurring between electrodeficient chalcogen atoms and Lewis bases. Among the chalcogens, tellurium is the strongest Lewis acid, but Te&#8208;based compounds are scarcely used as organocatalysts. For the first time, telluronium cations demonstrated impressive catalytic properties at low loadings in three benchmark reactions: the Friedel&#8211;Crafts bromination of anisole, the bromolactonization of &#969;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids and the aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder between Danishefsky's diene and imines. The ability of telluronium cations to interact with a Lewis base through chalcogen bonding was demonstrated on the basis of multi&#8208;nuclear (17O, 31P, and 125Te) NMR analysis and DFT calculations.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 18894-18894, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An important challenge in the direct utilization of Li metal as an anode material for next&#8208;generation batteries is the lack of stable solid electrolyte interphase layers. The problem is even more acute when non&#8208;flammable electrolytes, such as organic phosphates, are used. In their Research Article on page&#8197;19183, Dunwei Wang and co&#8208;workers report a new strategy that helps solve this issue. By introducing oxygen, the authors were able to induce unique chemical reactions that lead to safe operations of Li metal batteries that are flame&#8208;resistant.

The structure and regulation of the tyrosyl radical in ribonucleotide reductase in whole E.&#8197;coli cells was investigated by using advanced EPR spectroscopy. This radical starts the biosynthesis of DNA building blocks, and is thus involved in essential processes in life. The observations reported by M&#252;ge Kasanmascheff et&#8197;al. in their Research Article on page&#8197;19155 were surprising and exciting because the findings indicated a distinct radical distribution within the cells, pointing to a complex regulation mechanism of this fundamental enzyme in its native environment.

Mobilization upon cooling Adsorbed on a copper surface, dimolybdenum tetraacetate molecules form an ordered structure of upright&#8208;standing molecules at room temperature. Upon cooling down to 220&#8197;K, the molecules become mobile on the surface. This counterintuitive phase transition from an ordered structure at high temperatures to a mobile phase at low temperatures can be explained by a smaller molar entropy in the mobile phase as compared to the ordered phase, as reported by Angelika K&#252;hnle and co&#8208;workers in their Communication on page&#8197;19117.

In the highlighted article, the effect of alkane and water additives on the structure of several ionic liquids was used to increase the acidity of liquid reaction media and to accelerate the acid&#8208;catalyzed transformations. A possible connection between the appearance of a pronounced microstructure of the obtained systems and their performance in catalytic processes was proposed on the basis of microscopy and spectroscopy measurements.







Abstract
Comprehensive studies dedicated to the search for specific properties of matter at the micro&#8208; and nanoscales have greatly enriched the fields of chemistry and materials science. From the point of view of synthetic chemistry, discoveries in the field of nanoscale catalysis, in which the size effects of active centers are used to accelerate the reactions, are of particular importance. However, another approach for the promotion of chemical transformations based on the micro&#8208; or nanoconfinement of reacting molecules or even on the structuring of the reaction media as a whole is gaining interest as a highly valuable tool. Herein, we highlight the example of an increase in the efficiency of phenol alkylation and tert&#8208;butylation of benzyl alcohol in reaction media based on ionic liquids by the creation of acidic microdomains in the presence of small molecule additives.

Photo&#8208;mediated fixation of carbon&#8208;based gas molecules: C&#8722;C bond formation utilizing carbon&#8208;based small gas molecules, including CO, CO2, acetylene, ethylene, ethane and methane, as feedstocks is attractive but challenging. The emergence of photoredox chemistry and the development of engineered flow technology have provided vast opportunities for gas conversions, which has gained tremendous momentum over the past decade.







Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based gas molecules are readily available feedstocks and are widely used in industry as building blocks or fuels. However, their application in the synthesis of fine chemicals has been hampered due to operational complexity, poor reaction efficiency and selectivity. Recent development of photoredox&#8208;promoted transformations using such gaseous reagents has received considerable attention from the synthetic community. In this review, efforts in developing light&#8208;promoted organic transformations using carbon&#8208;based natural gases as C1 or C2 feedstocks and to overcome the associated challenges are briefly summarized.

This review brings out the key advancements made in the field of alkaline HER with metal hydroxides and their heterostructures and also provides a detailed and critical analysis of strategies and perspectives used with highlights on future prospects at the end.







Abstract
Transition metal hydroxides (M&#8208;OH) and their heterostructures (X|M&#8208;OH, where X can be a metal, metal oxide, metal chalcogenide, metal phosphide, etc.) have recently emerged as highly active electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of alkaline water electrolysis. Lattice hydroxide anions in metal hydroxides are primarily responsible for observing such an enhanced HER activity in alkali that facilitate water dissociation and assist the first step, the hydrogen adsorption. Unfortunately, their poor electronic conductivity had been an issue of concern that significantly lowered its activity. Interesting advancements were made when heterostructured hydroxide materials with a metallic and or a semiconducting phase were found to overcome this pitfall. However, in the midst of recently evolving metal chalcogenide and phosphide based HER catalysts, significant developments made in the field of metal hydroxides and their heterostructures catalysed alkaline HER and their superiority have unfortunately been given negligible attention. This review, unlike others, begins with the question of why alkaline HER is difficult and will take the reader through evaluation perspectives, trends in metals hydroxides and their heterostructures catalysed HER, an understanding of how alkaline HER works on different interfaces, what must be the research directions of this field in near future, and eventually summarizes why metal hydroxides and their heterostructures are inevitable for energy&#8208;efficient alkaline HER.

In vitro selected deoxyribozymes respond to the presence of methylcytidines m3C, m4C and m5C in RNA with either enhanced or strongly diminished cleavage rates, and thereby directly reveal the presence of the modified cytidines in target RNA.







Abstract
Deoxyribozymes are emerging as modification&#8208;specific endonucleases for the analysis of epigenetic RNA modifications. Here, we report RNA&#8208;cleaving deoxyribozymes that differentially respond to the presence of natural methylated cytidines, 3&#8208;methylcytidine (m3C), N4&#8208;methylcytidine (m4C), and 5&#8208;methylcytidine (m5C), respectively. Using in vitro selection, we found several DNA catalysts, which are selectively activated by only one of the three cytidine isomers, and display 10&#8208; to 30&#8208;fold accelerated cleavage of their target m3C&#8208;, m4C&#8208; or m5C&#8208;modified RNA. An additional deoxyribozyme is strongly inhibited by any of the three methylcytidines, but effectively cleaves unmodified RNA. The mXC&#8208;detecting deoxyribozymes are programmable for the interrogation of natural RNAs of interest, as demonstrated for human mitochondrial tRNAs containing known m3C and m5C sites. The results underline the potential of synthetic functional DNA to shape highly selective active sites.

         <title>Non&#8208;Invasive Sweat&#8208;Based Tracking of L&#8208;Dopa Pharmacokinetic Profiles Following an Oral Tablet Administration</title>

Non&#8208;invasive touch&#8208;based sweat measurements are used for tracking the pharmacokinetic profiles of levodopa following a single&#8208;dose oral tablet administration.







Abstract
Levodopa (L&#8208;Dopa) is the &#8220;gold&#8208;standard&#8221; medication for symptomatic therapy of Parkinson disease (PD). However, L&#8208;Dopa long&#8208;term use is associated with the development of motor and non&#8208;motor complications, primarily due to its fluctuating plasma levels in combination with the disease progression. Herein, we present the first example of individualized therapeutic drug monitoring for subjects upon intake of standard L&#8208;Dopa oral pill, centered on dynamic tracking of the drug concentration in naturally secreted fingertip sweat. The touch&#8208;based non&#8208;invasive detection method relies on instantaneous collection of fingertip sweat on a highly permeable hydrogel that transports the sweat to a biocatalytic tyrosinase&#8208;modified electrode, where sweat L&#8208;Dopa is measured by reduction of the dopaquinone enzymatic product. Personalized dose&#8208;response relationship is demonstrated within a group of human subjects, along with close pharmacokinetic correlation between the finger touch&#8208;based fingertip sweat and capillary blood samples.

&lt;p&gt;Non-invasive touch-based sweat measurements are used for tracking the pharmacokinetic profiles of levodopa following a single-dose oral tablet administration.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levodopa (L-Dopa) is the &#8220;gold-standard&#8221; medication for symptomatic therapy of Parkinson disease (PD). However, L-Dopa long-term use is associated with the development of motor and non-motor complications, primarily due to its fluctuating plasma levels in combination with the disease progression. Herein, we present the first example of individualized therapeutic drug monitoring for subjects upon intake of standard L-Dopa oral pill, centered on dynamic tracking of the drug concentration in naturally secreted fingertip sweat. The touch-based non-invasive detection method relies on instantaneous collection of fingertip sweat on a highly permeable hydrogel that transports the sweat to a biocatalytic tyrosinase-modified electrode, where sweat L-Dopa is measured by reduction of the dopaquinone enzymatic product. Personalized dose-response relationship is demonstrated within a group of human subjects, along with close pharmacokinetic correlation between the finger touch-based fingertip sweat and capillary blood samples.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>The Electronic Metal&#8211;Support Interaction Directing the Design of Single Atomic Site Catalysts: Achieving High Efficiency Towards Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19085-19091, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic metal&#8211;support interaction (EMSI) is closely related to the electronic structure of active sites, which determines the catalytic activity. We put forward a method of designing the EMSI of single&#8208;atomic site catalysts (SACs) to achieve high efficiency. The SACs achieve a lower overpotential and higher mass activity than any other SACs towards hydrogen evolution reaction, demonstrating the benefits of this method.







Abstract
It is still of great difficulty to develop the non&#8208;platinum catalyst with high catalytic efficiency towards hydrogen evolution reaction via the strategies till now. Therefore, it is necessary to develop the new methods of catalyst designing. Here, we put forward the catalyst designed by the electronic metal&#8211;support interaction (EMSI), which is demonstrated to be a reliable strategy to find out the high&#8208;efficiency catalyst. We carried out the density functional theory calculation first to design the proper EMSI of the catalyst. We applied the model of M1&#8208;M2&#8208;X (X=C, N, O) during the calculation. Among the catalysts we chose, the EMSI of Rh1TiC, with the active sites of Rh1&#8208;Ti2C2, is found to be the most proper one for HER. The electrochemical experiment further demonstrated the feasibility of the EMSI strategy. The single atomic site catalyst of Rh1&#8208;TiC exhibits higher catalytic efficiency than that of state&#8208;of&#8208;art Pt/C. It achieves a small overpotential of 22&#8197;mV and 86&#8197;mV at the at the current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in acid media, with a Tafel slope of 25&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 and a mass activity of 54403.9&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;mgRh&#8722;1 (vs. 192.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 of Pt/C). Besides, it also shows appealing advantage in energy saving compared with Pt/C (&#8776;20&#8201;% electricity consuming decrease at 2&#8197;kA&#8201;m&#8722;2) Therefore, we believe that the strategy of regulating EMSI can act as a possible way for achieving the high catalytic efficiency on the next step of SACs.

         <title>Manipulations of Chiroptical Properties in Belt&#8208;Persistent Cycloarylenes via Desymmetrization with Heteroatom Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19097-19101, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Desymmetrization of chiral cylindrical cycloarylenes ought to be beneficial to maximize the dissymmetry factor g via reduction of the electric dipole moment &#956;. An ideal D2 molecule has been synthesized by cross&#8208;coupling macrocyclization of two different arylene panels. Twists in biaryl linkages, however, enlarged an orthogonal component of &#956;, and the inclined and enlarged &#956; moment resulted in a much smaller g than expected.







Abstract
A desymmetrization strategy has been devised in the design of molecular cylinders to maximize the dissymmetry factor relevant to circularly polarized light. Although the highest dissymmetry factor of organic molecules was previously achieved with a chiral belt&#8208;persistent cycloarylene having magnetic and electric transition dipole moments in parallel, we noticed that an unbalanced magnitude of two moments was detrimental for higher dissymmetry factors. In this study, a molecular cylinder was desymmetrized by arraying doped and undoped panels via stereoselective cross&#8208;coupling macrocyclization. The desymmetrization succeeded in balancing two moments by reducing the electric transition moment at the global minimum but failed to maximize the dissymmetry factor. Structural studies revealed that the dissymmetry factor is sensitive to subtle structural fluctuations, while the rotatory strength is not affected. This study is important for the development of chiroptical materials.

         <title>Mobilization upon Cooling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19117-19122, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We all know that ice becomes liquid upon heating. In contrast, melting upon cooling is an unusual behavior. A system of molecules adsorbed to a surface, which become mobile upon cooling, was developed. The key for understanding these counterintuitive phase transitions lies in the fact that the high temperature ordered phase possesses more degrees of freedom leading to a larger entropy than the low&#8208;temperature unordered phase.







Abstract
Phase transitions between different aggregate states are omnipresent in nature and technology. Conventionally, a crystalline phase melts upon heating as we use ice to cool a drink. Already in 1903, Gustav Tammann speculated about the opposite process, namely melting upon cooling. So far, evidence for such &#8220;inverse&#8221; transitions in real materials is rare and limited to few systems or extreme conditions. Here, we demonstrate an inverse phase transition for molecules adsorbed on a surface. Molybdenum tetraacetate on copper(111) forms an ordered structure at room temperature, which dissolves upon cooling. This transition is mediated by molecules becoming mobile, i.e., by mobilization upon cooling. This unexpected phenomenon is ascribed to the larger number of internal degrees of freedom in the ordered phase compared to the mobile phase at low temperatures.

         <title>The Hydrates of TEMPO: Water Vibrations Reveal Radical Microsolvation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19013-19017, August 23, 2021. </description>

The mono&#8208; and dihydrates of the persistent TEMPO radical are vibrationally characterized at low temperature without environment, also by analogy to the closed shell ketone analogue from which it is formally obtained by replacing the C by an N atom.







Abstract
An organic radical monohydrate complex is detected in vacuum isolation at low temperature by FTIR supersonic jet spectroscopy for the first time. It is shown to exhibit a rich conformational and vibrational coupling dynamics, which can be drastically reduced by appropriate isotope substitution. Its detection with a new gas recycling infrared spectrometer demonstrates the thermal metastability of the gaseous TEMPO radical even under humid gas conditions. Compared to its almost isoelectronic and isostructural, closed shell ketone analogue, the hydrogen bond of the solvating water is found to be less directional, but stronger and more strongly downshifting the bonded water OH stretch vibration. A second solvent water directs the first one into a metastable hydrogen bond position to solvate the nitrogen center and the first water at the same time.

         <title>Oligonucleotide Phosphorothioates Enter Cells by Thiol&#8208;Mediated Uptake</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19102-19106, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Replacing one oxygen by one sulfur per monomer converts native oligonucleotides that cannot enter cells into cell&#8208;penetrating oligophosphorothioates. The reason for this is thiol&#8208;mediated uptake: dynamic covalent exchange with cellular thiols and disulfides that can be inhibited and activated according to the principles of dynamic covalent chemistry.







Abstract
Oligonucleotide phosphorothioates (OPS) are DNA or RNA mimics where one phosphate oxygen is replaced by a sulfur atom. They have been shown to enter mammalian cells much more efficiently than non&#8208;modified DNA. Thus, solving one of the key challenges with oligonucleotide technology, OPS became very useful in practice, with several FDA&#8208;approved drugs on the market or in late clinical trials. However, the mechanism accounting for this facile cellular uptake is unknown. Here, we show that OPS enter cells by thiol&#8208;mediated uptake. The transient adaptive network produced by dynamic covalent pseudo&#8208;disulfide exchange is characterized in action. Inhibitors with nanomolar efficiency are provided, together with activators that reduce endosomal capture for efficient delivery of OPS into the cytosol, the site of action.

         <title>Efficient Electroconversion of Carbon Dioxide to Formate by a Reconstructed Amino&#8208;Functionalized Indium&#8211;Organic Framework Electrocatalyst</title>

The amino&#8208;functionalized reconstructed indium&#8208;organic framework electrocatalyst demonstrates a high activity for carbon dioxide electroconversion to formate in a gas&#8208;phase flow cell.







Abstract
We report an amino&#8208;functionalized indium&#8208;organic framework for efficient CO2 reduction to formate. The immobilized amino groups strengthen the absorption and activation of CO2 and stabilize the active intermediates, which endow an enhanced catalytic conversion to formate despite the inevitable reduction and reconstruction of the functionalized indium&#8208;based catalyst during electrocatalysis. The reconstructed amino&#8208;functionalized indium&#8208;based catalyst demonstrates a high Faradaic efficiency of 94.4&#8201;% and a partial current density of 108&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.1&#8197;V vs. RHE in a liquid&#8208;phase flow cell, and also delivers an enhanced current density of ca. 800&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 3.4&#8197;V for the formate production in a gas&#8208;phase flow cell configuration. This work not only provides a molecular functionalization and assembling concept of hybrid electrocatalysts but also offers valuable understandings in electrocatalyst evolution and reactor optimization for CO2 electrocatalysis and beyond.

         <title>Selective Bond Cleavage in RAFT Agents Promoted by Low&#8208;Energy Electron Attachment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19128-19132, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron attachment leads to the efficient dissociation of carbonothioylsulfanyl molecules which are relevant for Reversible Addition&#8208;Fragmentation chain Transfer (RAFT) polymerization. We show that the preferred C&#8722;S bond cleavage can be initiated by an electron with almost no kinetic energy, in contrast to other dissociation reactions. This feature leads to a pronounced control of bond dissociation upon electron attachment.







Abstract
Radical polymerization with reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT polymerization) has been successfully applied to generate polymers of well&#8208;defined architecture. For RAFT polymerization a source of radicals is required. Recent work has demonstrated that for minimal side&#8208;reactions and high spatio&#8208;temporal control these should be formed directly from the RAFT agent or macroRAFT agent (usually carbonothiosulfanyl compounds) thermally, photochemically or by electrochemical reduction. In this work, we investigated low&#8208;energy electron attachment to a common RAFT agent (cyanomethyl benzodithioate), and, for comparison, a simple carbonothioylsulfanyl compound (dimethyl trithiocarbonate, DMTTC) in the gas phase by means of mass spectrometry as well as quantum chemical calculations. We observe for both compounds that specific cleavage of the C&#8722;S bond is induced upon low&#8208;energy electron attachment at electron energies close to zero eV. This applies even in the case of a poor homolytic leaving group (.CH3 in DMTTC). All other dissociation reactions found at higher electron energies are much less abundant. The present results show a high control of the chemical reactions induced by electron attachment.

A Ni&#8208;catalyzed highly selective C1&#8722;C8 bond cleavage of BCBs with the insertion of alkynes was achieved by the assistance of a removable blocking group. This method provided an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical approach to structurally important 1,8&#8208;naphthalenediols under pH&#8208;neutral conditions.







Abstract
Controlling the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C activation remains a great challenge. The transformations of benzocyclobutenones (BCBs) usually involve the cleavage of C1&#8722;C2 bond. In this work, an unprecedented highly selective cleavage of C1&#8722;C8 bond with the insertion of alkynes is achieved by using blocking strategy via Ni catalysis, providing an efficient method for synthesis of 1,8&#8208;disubstituted naphthalenes. Notably, the blocking group could be readily removed after the transformation.

A new type of acid&#8208;free neutral oxoborane has been prepared via a serendipitous discovery, from the reaction of 1,2&#8208;[BBr(carbene)]&#8208;o&#8208;carborane with AgOTf in which the shortest B=O distance observed so far has been measured, as confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analyses.







Abstract
An efficient synthesis of an acid&#8208;free neutral oxoborane of the type carboranyl&#8208;B(carbene)=O has been developed via a serendipitous discovery from the reaction of 1,2&#8208;[BBr(carbene)]&#8208;o&#8208;carborane with AgOTf. This represents a new type of oxoborane. The stabilization of this oxoborane may be attributed to 1)&#8197;kinetic stabilization provided by a bulky 3D carboranyl ligand and 2)&#8197;thermodynamic stabilization offered by a carbene ligand. Crystallographic analyses support the presence of the shortest terminal B=O double bond ever reported thus far. Its reactivity has also been examined.

         <title>Chiral Mesostructured BiOBr Films with Circularly Polarized Colour Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19024-19029, August 23, 2021. </description>

We report a chiral mesostructured BiOBr film exhibiting a chirality&#8208;dependent circularly polarized colour response due to the structural&#8208;handedness matching and synergistic effect of multiple optical activities.







Abstract
Achieving strong and broadband circularly polarized colour responses in chiral inorganic materials is challenging. Here, we fabricated chiral mesostructured bismuth oxybromide (BiOBr) films (CMBFs) via hydrothermal growth using chiral sugar alcohols as symmetry&#8208;breaking agents. The layered slabs of BiOBr crystals with weak van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals interactions are prone to mismatching due to the chiral driving force, resulting in hierarchically chiral arrangements of fine size. Three levels of chirality exist in the CMBFs: primary, helical distortion crystal lattices of a nanoflake, secondary, helical stacking of nanoflakes to form nanoplates, and tertiary, chiral vortexes arranged by nanoplates. The CMBFs displayed optical activities (OAs) over a wide wavelength range of 350&#8211;2500&#8197;nm with an anisotropic factor of up to 0.99, which led to a significant chirality&#8208;dependent colour response to circularly polarized light. The high selectivity can be considered as the result of enhanced resonance due to structural&#8208;handedness matching and the synergistic effect of multiple OAs.

         <title>Engineering Platinum&#8211;Cobalt Nano&#8208;alloys in Porous Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon Nanotubes for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>

Ultrafine Pt&#8208;Co alloy nanoparticles confined on the inner and outer surfaces of porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes (Pt&#8208;Co@NCNT) have been synthesized through a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;assisted pyrolysis&#8208;replacement&#8208;reorganization approach. With the structural and compositional merits, the Pt3Co@NCNT electrocatalyst presents superior activity and stability in both acidic and alkaline media for the hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Highly efficient electrocatalysts are essential for the production of green hydrogen from water electrolysis. Herein, a metal&#8208;organic framework&#8208;assisted pyrolysis&#8208;replacement&#8208;reorganization approach is developed to obtain ultrafine Pt&#8208;Co alloy nanoparticles (sub&#8208;10&#8197;nm) attached on the inner and outer shells of porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes (NCNT) with closed ends. During the thermal reorganization, the migration of Pt&#8208;Co nano&#8208;alloys to both surfaces ensures the maximized exposure of active sites while maintaining the robust attachment to the porous carbon matrix. Density functional theory calculations suggest a nearly thermodynamically&#8208;neutral free energy of adsorption for hydrogen intermediates and diversified active sites induced by alloying, thus resulting in a great promotion in intrinsic activity towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Benefiting from the delicate structural design and compositional modulation, the optimized Pt3Co@NCNT electrocatalyst manifests outstanding HER activity and superior stability in both acidic and alkaline media.

         <title>Single&#8208;Phase Covalent Organic Framework Staggered Stacking Nanosheet Membrane for CO2&#8208;Selective Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19047-19052, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three kinds of lamellar COFs were exfoliated into discrete nanosheets with large aspect&#8208;ratios. The nanosheets were assembled into ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional membranes with staggered stacking patterns, respectively. Taking advantage of narrowed pore size and CO2&#8208;philic adsorption, these single&#8208;phase COF nanosheet membranes were characterized by superior CO2/H2 separation performances.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) are considered as potential candidates for gas separation membranes, benefiting from permanent porosity, light&#8208;weight skeletons, excellent stability and facilely&#8208;tailored functionalities. However, their pore sizes are generally larger than the kinetic diameters of common gas molecules. One great challenge is the fabrication of single&#8208;phase COF membranes to realize precise gas separations. Herein, three kinds of high&#8208;quality &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;type COF nanosheets with different pore sizes were developed and aggregated to ultrathin nanosheet membranes with distinctive staggered stacking patterns. The narrowed pore sizes derived from the micro&#8208;structures and selective adsorption capacities synergistically endowed the COF membranes with intriguing CO2&#8208;philic separation performances, among which TpPa&#8208;2 with medium pore size exhibited an optimal CO2/H2 separation factor of 22 and a CO2 permeance of 328 gas permeation units at 298&#8197;K. This membrane performance reached the target with commercial feasibility for syngas separations.

         <title>Revision of the Unstable Picrotoxinin Hydrolysis Product</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19113-19116, August 23, 2021. </description>

The hydrolysis of picrotoxinin (PXN), which is a plant metabolite that is a widely used tool in neuroscience for the identification of GABAergic signaling, in weakly alkaline media gives an unstable hydrolysis intermediate that was initially assigned by analogy to the degradation product picrotoxic acid. This assignment however has been shown to be in error on the basis of the spectroscopic characterization of the hydrolysis product in situ. Counterintuitively, hydrolysis occurs at a lactone that remains closed in the major isolable degradation product, which accounts for the longstanding mistake in the literature.







Abstract
The plant metabolite picrotoxinin (PXN) is a widely used tool in neuroscience for the identification of GABAergic signaling. Its hydrolysis in weakly alkaline media has been observed for over a century and the structure of the unstable hydrolysis intermediate was assigned by analogy to the degradation product picrotoxic acid. Here we show this assignment to be in error and we revise the structure of the hydrolysis product by spectroscopic characterization in situ. Counterintuitively, hydrolysis occurs at a lactone that remains closed in the major isolable degradation product, which accounts for the longstanding mistake in the literature.

A novel kind of monocyclic and dicyclic dehydro[20]annulenes integrated with perylene diimide is developed. The macrocycles exhibit intense and characteristic absorption properties and degenerated LUMO levels. The porous supramolecular structures display micropore characteristics and charge transporting properties.







Abstract
A novel kind of monocyclic and dicyclic dehydro[20]annulenes exhibiting specific sizes and topologies from regioselective unilateral ortho&#8208;diethynyl PDI, is developed by Cu&#8208;catalyzed Glaser&#8211;Hay homo&#8208;coupling and cross&#8208;coupling. Through the integration of electron&#8208;deficient PDI chromophores into the dehydroannulene scaffolding, these macrocycles exhibit intense and characteristic absorption properties and the degenerated LUMO levels. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis unambiguously revealed unique porous supramolecular structures, which display micropore characteristics with surface area of 120.74&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1. A moderate electron mobility of 0.05&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 for chlorine&#8208;free dehydro[20]annulene based on micrometer&#8208;sized single&#8208;crystalline transistors was witnessed. The porous and yet semiconducting features signify the prospects of PDI&#8208;integrated dehydroannulenes in organic optoelectronics.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective Alkenylarylation of &#947;,&#948;&#8208;Alkenyl Ketones via Carbonyl Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19092-19096, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed alkenylarylation reaction of &#947;,&#948;&#8208;alkenylketones with alkenyl triflates and arylboronic esters is described. The reaction was made feasible by the use of 5&#8208;chloro&#8208;8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline as a ligand along with NiBr2&#8901;DME as a catalyst and LiOtBu as base, and works with cyclic, acyclic, endocyclic and exocyclic alkenyl ketones. Control experiments indicate that carbonyl coordination is required for the reaction to proceed.







Abstract
We disclose a nickel&#8208;catalyzed reaction, which enabled us to difunctionalize unactivated &#947;,&#948;&#8208;alkenes in ketones with alkenyl triflates and arylboronic esters. The reaction was made feasible by the use of 5&#8208;chloro&#8208;8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline as a ligand along with NiBr2&#8901;DME as a catalyst and LiOtBu as base. The reaction proceeded with a wide range of cyclic, acyclic, endocyclic and exocyclic alkenyl ketones, and electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient arylboronate esters. The reaction also worked with both cyclic and acyclic alkenyl triflates. Control experiments indicate that carbonyl coordination is required for the reaction to proceed.

         <title>The Mechanism of Dehydrating Bimodules in trans&#8208;Acyltransferase Polyketide Biosynthesis: A Showcase Study on Hepatoprotective Hangtaimycin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19139-19143, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hangtaimycin biosynthesis proceeds through a hybrid trans&#8208;AT PKS/NRPS biosynthetic machinery that contains distinctive dehydrating bimodules. Here we present detailed mechanistic insights into catalysis by dehydrating bimodules that are generally involved in the biosynthesis of polyketides with Z double bonds. This work lays the foundations for future structural modifications by protein engineering.







Abstract
A bioassay&#8208;guided fractionation led to the isolation of hangtaimycin (HTM) from Streptomyces spectabilis CCTCC M2017417 and the discovery of its hepatoprotective properties. Structure elucidation by NMR suggested the need for a structural revision. A putative HTM degradation product was also isolated and its structure was confirmed by total synthesis. The biosynthetic gene cluster was identified and resembles a hybrid trans&#8208;AT PKS/NRPS biosynthetic machinery whose first PKS enzyme contains an internal dehydrating bimodule, which is usually found split in other trans&#8208;AT PKSs. The mechanisms of such dehydrating bimodules have often been proposed, but have never been deeply investigated. Here we present in vivo mutations and in vitro enzymatic experiments that give first and detailed mechanistic insights into catalysis by dehydrating bimodules.

         <title>Silicon Naphthalocyanine Tetraimides: Cathode Interlayer Materials for Highly Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19053-19057, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
SiNcTI&#8208;Br with strong self&#8208;doping property, high conductivity, and high electron mobility is an excellent cathode interlayer material. The interlayer boosts the power conversion efficiency of PM6:Y6&#8208;based OSCs to 16.71&#8201;%. It is the first naphthalocyanine derivative used as interlayer material in optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
Naphthalocyanine derivatives (SiNcTI&#8208;N and SiNcTI&#8208;Br) were firstly used as excellent cathode interlayer materials (CIMs) in organic solar cells, via introducing four electron&#8208;withdrawing imide groups and two hydrophilic alkyls. Both of them showed deep LUMO energy levels (below &#8722;3.90&#8197;eV), good thermal stability (Td &gt;210&#8201;&#176;C), and strong self&#8208;doping property. The SiNcTI&#8208;Br CIM displayed high conductivity (4.5&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and electron mobility (7.81&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), which could boost the efficiencies of the PM6:Y6&#8208;based OSCs over a wide range of CIM layer thicknesses (4&#8211;25&#8197;nm), with maximum efficiency of 16.71&#8201;%.

A direct &#947;&#8208;oxidation of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated amides is reported. This regioselective reaction with TEMPO proceeds under mild conditions, tolerant of other carbonyl functionality. A rare example of regioselective amide activation of unsaturated substrates; it results in products carrying oxyaminated substitution ripe for remarkably selective radical cyclisation reactions.







Abstract
A chemoselective and robust protocol for the &#947;&#8208;oxidation of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated amides is reported. In this method, electrophilic amide activation, in a rare application to unsaturated amides, enables a regioselective reaction with TEMPO resulting in the title products. Radical cyclisation reactions and oxidation of the synthesised products highlight the synthetic utility of the products obtained.

         <title>Nanoscale Chemical Imaging of Supported Lipid Monolayers using Tip&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19041-19046, August 23, 2021. </description>

Label&#8208;free and non&#8208;destructive chemical and structural imaging of supported DPPC monolayers on Au (111) is demonstrated with a spatial resolution of &#8776;20&#8197;nm using tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) for the first time. Ultra&#8208;high sensitivity and spatial resolution of TERS allows reproducible hyperspectral visualization of molecular disorder within DPPC monolayers.







Abstract
Visualizing the molecular organization of lipid membranes is essential to comprehend their biological functions. However, current analytical techniques fail to provide a non&#8208;destructive and label&#8208;free characterization of lipid films under ambient conditions at nanometer length scales. In this work, we demonstrate the capability of tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) to probe the molecular organization of supported DPPC monolayers on Au (111), prepared using the Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett (LB) technique. High&#8208;quality TERS spectra were obtained, that permitted a direct correlation of the topography of the lipid monolayer with its TERS image for the first time. Furthermore, hyperspectral TERS imaging revealed the presence of nanometer&#8208;sized holes within a continuous DPPC monolayer structure. This shows that a homogeneously transferred LB monolayer is heterogeneous at the nanoscale. Finally, the high sensitivity and spatial resolution down to 20&#8197;nm of TERS imaging enabled reproducible, hyperspectral visualization of molecular disorder in the DPPC monolayers, demonstrating that TERS is a promising nanoanalytical tool to investigate the molecular organization of lipid membranes.

Furthermore, hyperspectral TERS imaging revealed the presence of nanometer-sized holes within a continuous DPPC monolayer structure. This shows that a homogeneously transferred LB monolayer is heterogeneous at the nanoscale. Finally, the high sensitivity and spatial resolution down to 20&#8197;nm of TERS imaging enabled reproducible, hyperspectral visualization of molecular disorder in the DPPC monolayers, demonstrating that TERS is a promising nanoanalytical tool to investigate the molecular organization of lipid membranes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyst&#8208;Enabled para&#8208;Selective Trifluoromethylation of tert&#8208;Butyl Arylcarbamates</title>

We report a light&#8208;promoted 4,5&#8208;dichlorofluorescein (DCFS)&#8208;enabled para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of arylcarbamates using the Langlois reagent. Arylcarbamates, including the bioactive compound chlorzoxazone, vorinostat precursor, chlorpropham, and teriflunomide precursors, were suitable for this reaction, leading to the formation of the corresponding products in moderate to good yields.







Abstract
The direct incorporation of a trifluoromethyl group on an aromatic ring using a radical pathway has been extensively investigated. However, the direct highly para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of a class of arenes has not been achieved. In this study, we report a light&#8208;promoted 4,5&#8208;dichlorofluorescein (DCFS)&#8208;enabled para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of arylcarbamates using Langlois reagent. The preliminary mechanistic study revealed that the activated organic photocatalyst coordinated with the arylcarbamate led to para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation. Ten&#8208;gram scale reaction performs well highlighting the synthetic importance of this new protocol.

         <title>Cationic Carbene Analogues: Donor&#8208;Free Phosphenium and Arsenium Ions</title>

Donor&#8208;free, kinetically stabilized diarylphosphenium and arsenium ions were obtained using a combination of bulky rigid aryl substituents and a weakly coordinating anion.







Abstract
Carbenes and their analogues have constantly enthralled chemists with their intriguing reactivity of ambiphilic character stemming from their electronic structures. Phosphenium and arsenium ions are fiercely reactive cationic species, the stabilization of which has been so far achieved in the condensed phase by dispersing the positive charge through electromeric conjugation with at least one electron&#8208;rich substituent (frequently amido groups). Although observed in the gas phase, the isolation of dicoordinate phosphenium and arsenium ions lacking such stabilizing ligands has eluded chemists for decades. Herein we show that by judicious choice of aromatic substituents, dicoordinate, donor&#8208;free, Lewis&#8208;superacidic phosphenium and arsenium ions can be kinetically stabilized. They feature singlet electronic ground states possessing a vacant p&#8208;orbital and an electron lone pair with predominantly s&#8208;character.

         <title>Low&#8208;Density 2D Superlattices Assembled via Directional DNA Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19035-19040, August 23, 2021. </description>

Cubic, octahedral, and rhombic&#8208;dodecahedral (RD) nanoparticle (NP) films are assembled on substrates using DNA. Octahedral and RD films rearrange into novel low&#8208;density 2D structures, which are difficult to access using other methods for assembling NPs into superlattices.







Abstract
It is critical to assemble nanoparticles (NPs) into superlattices with controlled symmetries and spacings on substrates for metamaterials applications, where such structural parameters dictate their properties. Here, we use DNA to assemble anisotropic NPs of three shapes&#8212;cubes, octahedra, and rhombic dodecahedra&#8212;on substrates and investigate their thermally induced reorganization into two&#8208;dimensional (2D) crystalline films. We report two new low&#8208;density 2D structures, including a honeycomb lattice based on octahedral NPs. The low&#8208;density lattices favored here are not usually seen when particles are crystallized via other bottom&#8208;up assembly techniques. Furthermore, we show that, consistent with the complementary contact model, a primary driving force for crystallization is the formation of directional, face&#8208;to&#8208;face DNA bonds between neighboring NPs and between NPs and the substrate. Our results can be used to deliberately prepare crystalline NP films with novel morphologies.

         <title>Wiggling Mesopores Kinetically Amplify the Adsorptive Separation of Propylene/Propane</title>

Wiggling mesopores in monolithic carbon adsorbents lead to synergistic kinetic and equilibrium effects, allowing highly selective C3H6/C3H8 separation under practical dynamic conditions.







Abstract
Adsorptive separation is an appealing technology for propylene and propane separation; however, the challenge lies in the design of efficient adsorbents which can distinguish the two molecules having very similar properties. Here we report a kinetically amplified separation by creating wiggling mesopores in structurally robust carbon monoliths. The wiggling mesopores with alternating wide and narrow segments afford a surface area of 413&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a tri&#8208;modal pore size distribution centered at 1.5, 4.2 and 6.6&#8197;nm, respectively. The synergistically kinetic and equilibrium effects were observed and quantitatively assessed, which together ensured a remarkable propylene/propane selectivity up to 39. This selectivity outperformed not only the available carbon adsorbents but also highly competitive among the dominated crystalline porous adsorbents. In addition, the wiggling mesoporous carbon adsorbent showed excellent dynamical separation stability, which ensured its great potential in practical molecular separations.

         <title>Compressive Strain Modulation of Single Iron Sites on Helical Carbon Support Boosts Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing and modulating the local structure of metal sites is the key to gain the unique selectivity and high activity of single metal site catalysts. Herein, we report strain engineering of curved single atomic iron&#8208;nitrogen sites to boost electrocatalytic activity. First, a helical carbon structure with abundant high&#8208;curvature surface is realized by carbonization of helical polypyrrole that is templated from self&#8208;assembled chiral surfactants. The high&#8208;curvature surface introduces compressive strain on the supported Fe&#8208;N4  sites. Consequently, the curved Fe&#8208;N4 sites with 1.5% compressed Fe&#8208;N bonds exhibit downshifted d&#8208;band center than the planar sites. Such a change can weaken the bonding strength between the oxygenated intermediates and metal sites, resulting a much smaller energy barrier for oxygen reduction. Catalytic tests further demonstrate that a kinetic current density of 7.922 mA/cm2  at 0.9 V  vs.  RHE is obtained in alkaline media for curved Fe&#8208;N4 sites, which is 31 times higher than that for planar ones. Our findings shed light on modulating the local three&#8208;dimensional structure of single metal sites and boosting the catalytic activity via strain engineering.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this communication, we demonstrate a novel approach to prepare a discrete dimer of chiral phthalocyanine (Pc) by exploiting the flexible molecular geometry of helicenes, which enables structural interlocking and strong aggregation tendency of Pcs. Synthesized [7]helicene&#8211;Pc hybrid molecular structure, zinc&#8208;[7]helicenocyanine (Zn&#8208;7HPc), &#160;exclusively forms a stable dimeric pair consisting of two homochiral molecules. The dimerization constants were estimated to be as high as 8.96 &#215; 10  6  M  &#8211;1  and 3.42 &#215; 10  7  M  &#8211;1  in THF and DMSO, respectively, indicating remarkable stability of dimer. In addition, Zn&#8208;7HPc exhibited chiral self&#8208;sorting behavior, which resulted in preferential formation of a homochiral dimer also in the racemic sample. Two phthalocyanine subunits in the dimeric form strongly communicate with each other as revealed by a large comproportionation constant and observation of an IV&#8208;CT band for the thermodynamically stable mixed&#8208;valence state.</dc:description>

         <title>Development and Mechanistic Studies of the Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Alkenylation of Enamides with Vinyl Acetates: A Versatile Approach for Ketone Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H alkenylation of enamides with vinyl acetate has been developed as a versatile approach to diverse ketone functionalization (see scheme). The method exhibits broad substrate scope and high chemoselectivity. It also features a reaction pathway involving 1,2&#8208;Ir&#8208;C migratory insertion and syn&#8208;&#946;&#8208;acetoxy elimination.







Abstract
Ketone functionalization is a cornerstone of organic synthesis. Herein, we describe the development of an intermolecular C&#8722;H alkenylation of enamides with the feedstock chemical vinyl acetate to access diverse functionalized ketones. Enamides derived from various cyclic and acyclic ketones reacted efficiently, and a number of sensitive functional groups were tolerated. In this iridium&#8208;catalyzed transformation, two structurally and electronically similar alkenes&#8212;enamide and vinyl acetate&#8212;underwent selective cross&#8208;coupling through C&#8722;H activation. No reaction partner was used in large excess. The reaction is also pH&#8208; and redox&#8208;neutral with HOAc as the only stoichiometric by&#8208;product. Detailed experimental and computational studies revealed a reaction mechanism involving 1,2&#8208;Ir&#8208;C migratory insertion followed by syn&#8208;&#946;&#8208;acetoxy elimination, which is different from that of previous vinyl acetate mediated C&#8722;H activation reactions. Finally, the alkenylation product can serve as a versatile intermediate to deliver a variety of structurally modified ketones.

         <title>Electro&#8208;mediated PhotoRedox Catalysis for Selective C(sp3)&#8211;O Cleavages of Phosphinated Alcohols to Carbanions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beyond C(sp2)&#8211;X cleavage: We report reductive cleavages of C(sp3)&#8722;O bonds of phosphinated alcohols to alkyl carbanions by electro&#8208;mediated photoredox catalysis. Deoxygenations as well as E&#8208; or Z&#8208;selective olefinations are reported. Surprisingly, reactions tolerate C(sp2)&#8211;X cleavages such as aryl halides. Radical ion catalyst&#8208;substrate preassembly is key in enabling reactivity and overturning conventional redox chemoselectivity.







Abstract
We report a novel example of electro&#8208;mediated photoredox catalysis (e&#8208;PRC) in the reductive cleavage of C(sp3)&#8722;O bonds of phosphinated alcohols to alkyl carbanions. As well as deoxygenations, olefinations are reported which are E&#8208;selective and can be made Z&#8208;selective in a tandem reduction/photosensitization process where both steps are photoelectrochemically promoted. Spectroscopy, computation, and catalyst structural variations reveal that our new naphthalene monoimide&#8208;type catalyst allows for an intimate dispersive precomplexation of its radical anion form with the phosphinate substrate, facilitating a reactivity&#8208;determining C(sp3)&#8722;O cleavage. Surprisingly and in contrast to previously reported photoexcited radical anion chemistries, our conditions tolerate aryl chlorides/bromides and do not give rise to Birch&#8208;type reductions.

         <title>Molecular Electrostatic Potential and Noncovalent Interactions in Derivatives of Group 8 Elements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#963;&#8208;hole interactions in adducts between nitrogen or oxygen nucleophiles and tetroxides of osmium or other group&#8197;8 elements are reported. Cocrystals between pyridine or pyridine N&#8208;oxide derivatives and osmium tetroxide are characterized through various techniques including computational tools. We propose the term &#8220;osme bond&#8221; (OmB, Om=Fe, Ru, Os, (Hs)) for naming the noncovalent interactions wherein group&#8197;8 elements have the role of the electrophile.







Abstract
This communication reports experimental and theoretical evidences of &#963;&#8208;hole interactions in adducts between nitrogen or oxygen nucleophiles and tetroxides of osmium or other group&#8197;8 elements. Cocrystals between pyridine or pyridine N&#8208;oxide derivatives and osmium tetroxide are characterized through various techniques and rationalized as &#963;&#8208;hole interactions using DFT calculations and several other computational tools. We propose the term &#8220;osme bond&#8221; (OmB, Om=Fe, Ru, Os, (Hs)) for naming the noncovalent interactions wherein group&#8197;8 elements have the role of the electrophile. The word osme is the transcription of &#8000;&#963;&#956;&#942;, the ancient Greek word for smell that was used to name the heaviest group&#8197;8 element in relation to the smoky odor of its tetroxide.

         <title>Molecular Tailoring of an n/p&#8208;type Phenothiazine Organic Scaffold for Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis(phenylamino)phenothiazin&#8208;5&#8208;ium iodide (PTD&#8208;1) is explored as the cathode of aqueous Zn batteries, which contains both n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type redox moieties and exhibits a hybrid charge storage mechanism (i.e., n/p&#8208;type at low potential + p&#8208;type at high potential). With the benefit of the hybrid charge storage mode, the full cells exhibit high average voltage and capacity, and achieve long&#8208;life and supercapacitor&#8208;like high power.







Abstract
The p&#8208;type or n&#8208;type redox reactions of organics are being used as the reversible electrodes to build the next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries with sustainable and tunable characteristics. However, the n&#8208;type organics that store cations generally exhibit low potential (&lt;0.8&#8197;V vs. Zn/Zn2+), while the p&#8208;type organics that store anions suffer from limited capacity (&lt;100&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1). Herein, we demonstrate that bis(phenylamino)phenothiazin&#8208;5&#8208;ium iodide (PTD&#8208;1) containing both n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type redox moieties exhibits a hybrid charge storage mechanism (n/p&#8208;type at low potential, p&#8208;type at high potential). Such a hybrid mechanism combines the advantages of n&#8208; and p&#8208;type reactions and compensates for the associated drawbacks of each. Accordingly, the aqueous Zn//PTD&#8208;1 full cell shows a high voltage (1.8&#8197;Vmaximum or 1.1&#8197;Vaverage), a high capacity 188.24&#8197;mAh&#8201;gPTD&#8208;1&#8722;1 (achieved at 40&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1), a long&#8208;life and a supercapacitor&#8208;like high power. These results shed new light on the design of advanced organic electrodes.

&lt;p&gt;Bis(phenylamino)phenothiazin-5-ium iodide (PTD-1) is explored as the cathode of aqueous Zn batteries, which contains both n-type and p-type redox moieties and exhibits a hybrid charge storage mechanism (i.e., n/p-type at low potential + p-type at high potential).

&lt;p&gt;The p-type or n-type redox reactions of organics are being used as the reversible electrodes to build the next-generation rechargeable batteries with sustainable and tunable characteristics. However, the n-type organics that store cations generally exhibit low potential (&amp;lt;0.8&#8197;V vs. Zn/Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), while the p-type organics that store anions suffer from limited capacity (&amp;lt;100&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Herein, we demonstrate that bis(phenylamino)phenothiazin-5-ium iodide (PTD-1) containing both n-type and p-type redox moieties exhibits a hybrid charge storage mechanism (n/p-type at low potential, p-type at high potential). Such a hybrid mechanism combines the advantages of n- and p-type reactions and compensates for the associated drawbacks of each.

         <title>Crystalline Phase Recognition induced Domino Phase Transition and Luminescent Switching for Advanced Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, a new mechanism, namely crystalline phase recognition (CPR), is proposed for the single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transition of metal halides. Chiral  &#946;  &#8208;[Bmmim]  2  SbCl  5  (  2  , Bmmim = 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;methylimidazolium) can recognize achiral  &#945;  &#8208;[Bmmim]  2  SbCl  5  (  1  ) with a key&#8208;lock feature through inter&#8208;contacting of their single crystals, resulting in a domino phase transition (DPT). The concomitant photoluminescent (PL) switching is beneficial for us to observe the DPT  in&#8208;situ  . Liquid eutectic interface, stress&#8208;strain transfer and feasible thermodynamics are key issues for the CPR. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and PL measurements reveal that the optical absorption and emission for title isomers mainly originate from [SbCl  5  ]  2&#8208;  anions. The structural effects (  e.g.  , supramolecular interactions and [SbCl  5  ]  2&#8208;  distortion) on the optical emission (  e.g.  , photoluminescent quantum yield and peak shift) are clarified. As a novel manner of stimuli&#8208;response, the CPR induced DPT and luminescent switching exhibit potential application in advanced time&#8208;resolved information encryption.</dc:description>

         <title>Cation&#8208;Exchange Induced Metal and Alloy Dual&#8208;exsolution in Perovskite Ferrite Oxides Boosting the Performance of Li&#8208;O2 Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exsolution is an effective method to in&#8208;situ construct metal or alloy decorated perovskite oxides with tunable properties in energy storage and conversion systems. However, precise control of the exsolved structure and compositions remains challenging. Herein, a temperature&#8208;controlled cation&#8208;exchange approach is introduced to achieve a unique dual&#8208;exsolution in perovskite La0.8Fe0.9Co0.1O3&#8208;&#948;  &#160;where both CoFe&#8208;alloy and Co metal are simultaneously exsolved from the parent perovskite, forming an alloy and metal co&#8208;decorated perovskite oxide. Mossbauer spectra proves that cation exchange of Fe atoms in CoFe alloy and Co cations in the perovskite is the key to the co&#8208;existence of Co metal and CoFe alloy. The obtained composite exhibits an enhanced catalytic activity as Li&#8208;O2  &#160;battery cathode catalysts with a specific discharge capacity of 6549.7 mAh g&#8208;1  &#160;and a cycling performance of 215 cycles without noticeable degradation. Theoretical calculation proves that the combination of decorated CoFe&#8208;alloy and Co&#8208;metal synergistically modulated the discharge reaction pathway that improves the performance of Li&#8208;O2  &#160;battery, which should pave the way for the application of high performance ferrite&#8208;based Li&#8208;O2  &#160;battery.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed meta&#8208;Selective C&#8211;H Carboxylation Reaction of 1,1&#8208;Diarylethylenes via Hydrorhodation&#8208;Rhodium Migration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We achieved a  meta  &#8208;selective C&#8211;H carboxylation reaction of 1,1&#8208;diarylethylene derivatives with CO  2  using a rhodium catalyst with NaO  i  Pr as a stoichiometric reductant. Together with hydrogenation of the ethylene moiety, a carboxyl group was introduced to the  meta&#8208;  position on the aryl ring with high selectivity over the  ortho  &#8208;positions. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies indicate that this carboxylation reaction proceeds via hydrorhodation on the ethylene moiety, followed by 1,4&#8208;rhodium migration and successive 1,2&#8208;rhodium migration on the aryl ring. The use of a bulky phosphine ligand seems to be the key to this unusual aryl&#8208;to&#8208;aryl 1,2&#8208;rhodium shift.</dc:description>

         <title>Segmented Polyurethanes and Thermoplastic Elastomers from Elemental Sulfur with Enhanced Thermomechanical Properties and Flame Retardancy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The production of elemental sulfur from petroleum refining has created a technological opportunity to increase the valorization of elemental sulfur by the creation of high performance sulfur based plastics with improved thermomechanical properties, elasticity and flame retardancy. We report on a synthetic polymerization methodology to prepare the first example of sulfur based segmented multi&#8208;block polyurethanes (SPUs) and thermoplastic elastomers that incorporate an appreciable amount of sulfur into the final target material. This approach applied both the inverse vulcanization of S  8  with olefinic alcohols and dynamic covalent polymerizations with dienes to prepare sulfur polyols and terpolyols that were used in polymerizations with aromatic diisocyanates and short chain diols. Using these methods a new class of high molecular weight, soluble block copolymer polyurethanes were prepared as confirmed by Size Exclusion Chromatography, NMR spectroscopy, thermal analysis and microscopic imaging. These sulfur based polyurethanes were readily solution processed into large area free standing films where both the tensile strength and elasticity of these materials were controlled by variation of the sulfur polyol composition. SPUs with both high tensile strength (13&#8208;23 MPa) and ductility (348% strain at break) were prepared, along with SPU thermoplastic elastomers (578% strain at break) which are comparable values to classical thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPUs). The incorporation of sulfur into these polyurethanes, we observe enhanced flame retardancy in comparison to classical TPUs, which points to the opportunity to impart new properties to polymeric materials as a consequence of using elemental sulfur.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton Traffic Jam: Effect of Nanoconfinement and Acid Concentration on Proton Hopping Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The properties of the water network in concentrated HCl acid pools in nanometer&#8208;sized reverse non&#8208;ionic micelles were probed with TeraHertz absorption, dielectric relaxation spectroscopy, and reactive force field simulations capable of describing proton hopping mechanisms. We identify that only at a critical micelle size of W0=9 do solvated proton complexes form in the water pool, accompanied by a change in mechanism from Grotthuss forward shuttling to one that favors local oscillatory hopping. This is due to a preference for H+ and Cl&#8211; ions to adsorb to the micelle interface, together with an acid concentration effect that causes a &#8220;traffic jam&#8221; in which the short&#8208;circuiting of the hydrogen&#8208;bonding motif of the hydronium ion decreases the forward hopping rate throughout the water interior even as the micelle size increases. These findings have implications for atmospheric chemistry, biochemical and biophysical environments, and energy materials, as transport of protons vital to these processes can be suppressed due to confinement, aggregation, and/or concentration.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Searching for a connection between the two&#8208;electron redox behavior of group 14 elements and their possible use as platforms for the photoreductive elimination of chlorine, we have studied the photochemistry of [(o&#8208;(Ph  2  P)C  6  H  4  )  2  Ge  IV  Cl  2  ]Pt  II  Cl  2  and [(o&#8208;(Ph  2  P)C  6  H  4  )  2  ClGe  III  ]Pt  III  Cl  3  , two newly isolated isomeric complexes.

         <title>Azide&#183;&#183;&#183;Oxygen Interaction: A Crystal Engineering Tool for Conformational Locking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have designed, synthesized and crystallized 36 compounds, each containing an azide group and an oxygen atom separated by three bonds. Crystal structure analysis revealed that each of these molecules adopts a conformation in which the azide and oxygen groups orient syn to each other with a short O &#183;&#183;&#183; N  b  &#160;contact. Geometry&#8208;optimized structures [using&#160; M06&#8208;2X/6&#8208;311G(d,p) level of theory ] also showed the syn conformation in all 36 of these cases, suggesting that this not merely a crystal packing effect. Quantum topological analysis using Bader&#8217;s Atoms in Molecules (AIM) theory revealed bond paths and bond critical points (BCP) in these structures suggesting its nature and energetics to be similar to weak hydrogen bonding. The NCI&#8208;RDG plot clearly revealed the attractive interaction consisting of electrostatic or dispersive components in all the 36 systems. NBO analysis suggested a weak orbital&#8208;relaxation (charge&#8208;transfer) contribution of energy for a few&#160;  (sp2)  O&#8208;donor systems. Natural population analysis (NPA) and molecular electrostatic potential mapping (MESP) of these crystal structures further revealed the existence of favorable azide&#8208;oxygen interaction. &#160; A CSD search indicated the frequent and consistent occurrence of this interaction and its role dictating the syn conformation of azide and oxygen in molecules where these groups are separated by 2&#8208;4 bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Anion&#8208;Derived Solid Electrolyte Interphase by Regulating the Electrolyte Structure of Anions in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium (Li) metal batteries are severely hindered by the dendritic Li deposition dictated by non&#8208;uniform solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Despite its unique advantages in improving the uniformity of Li deposition, the current anion&#8208;derived SEI is unsatisfactory under practical conditions. Herein regulating the electrolyte structure of anions by anion receptors was proposed to construct stable anion&#8208;derived SEI. Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (TPFPB) anion acceptors with electron&#8208;deficient boron atoms interact with bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide anions (FSI  &#8722;  ) and decrease the reduction stability of FSI  &#8722;  . Furthermore, the type of aggregate cluster of FSI  &#8722;  in electrolyte changes, FSI  &#8722;  interacting with more Li ions in the presence of TPFPB. Therefore, the decomposition of FSI  &#8722;  to form Li  2  S are promoted, improving the stability of anion&#8208;derived SEI. In working Li | LiNi  0.5  Co  0.2  Mn  0.3  O  2  batteries under practical conditions, the anion&#8208;derived SEI with TPFPB undergoes 194 cycles compared with 98 cycles of routine anion&#8208;derived SEI. This work inspires a fresh ground to construct stable anion&#8208;derived SEI by manipulating the electrolyte structure of anions in working electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable Pd(OAc)2 Hydroquinone Cocatalyst System for Cis&#8208;Selective Dibenzoyloxylation of 1,3&#8208;Cyclohexadiene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 1,4&#8208;diacyloxylation of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene (CHD) affords valuable stereochemically defined scaffolds for natural product and pharmaceutical synthesis. Existing  cis  &#8208;selective diacyloxylation protocols require superstoichiometric quantities of benzoquinone (BQ) or MnO  2  , which limit process sustainability and large&#8208;scale application. In this report, reaction development and mechanistic studies are described that overcome these limitations by pairing catalytic BQ with  tert&#8208;  butyl hydroperoxide as the stoichiometric oxidant. Catalytic quantities of bromide enable a switch from  trans  to  cis  diastereoselectivity. A catalyst with a 1:2 Pd:Br ratio supports high  cis  selectivity while retaining good rate and product yield. Further studies enable replacement of BQ with hydroquinone (HQ) as a source of cocatalyst, avoiding the handling of volatile and toxic BQ in large scale applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Garsubellin A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Garsubellin A is a meroterpene capable of enhancing the enzyme choline acetyltransferase whose decreased level is believed to play a central role in the symptoms of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. Due to the potentially useful biological activity together with the novel bridged and fused cyclic molecular architecture, garsubellin A has garnered substantial synthetic interest, but its absolute stereostructure has been undetermined. We report here the first enantioselective total synthesis of (+)&#8208;garsubellin A. Our synthesis relies on stereoselective fashioning of a cyclohexanone framework and double conjugate addition of 1,2&#8208;ethanedithiol that promotes aldol cyclization to build the bicyclic [3.3.1] skeleton. The twelve&#8208;step, protecting group&#8208;free synthetic route has enabled the syntheses of both the natural (&#8211;)&#8208;garsubellin A and its unnatural (+)&#8208;antipode for biological evaluations.</dc:description>

Our synthesis relies on stereoselective fashioning of a cyclohexanone framework and double conjugate addition of 1,2-ethanedithiol that promotes aldol cyclization to build the bicyclic [3.3.1] skeleton. The twelve-step, protecting group-free synthetic route has enabled the syntheses of both the natural (&#8211;)-garsubellin A and its unnatural (+)-antipode for biological evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deracemization of racemic chiral compounds is an attractive approach in asymmetric synthesis, but its development has been hindered by energetic and kinetic challenges. Here we describe a catalytic deracemization method for secondary benzylic alcohols which are important synthetic intermediates and end products for many industries. Driven by visible light only, this method is based on sequential photochemical dehydrogenation followed by enantioselective thermal hydrogenation. The combination of a heterogeneous dehydrogenation photocatalyst and a chiral molecular hydrogenation catalyst is essential to ensure two distinct pathways for the forward and reverse reactions. These reactions convert a large number of racemic aryl alkyl alcohols into their enantiomerically enriched forms in good yields and enantioselectivities.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantioselective synthesis of bioactive compounds bearing a pyrroloindole framework is often laborious. In contrast, there are several  S  &#8208;adenosyl methionine (SAM) dependent methyl transferases known for stereo&#8208; and regioselective methylation at the C3 position of various indoles, directly leading to the formation of the desired pyrroloindole moiety. Herein, the SAM dependent methyl transferase PsmD from  Streptomyces griseofuscus  , a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of physostigmine, is characterized in detail. The biochemical properties of PsmD and its substrate scope was demonstrated. Preparative scale enzymatic methylation including SAM regeneration was achieved for three selected substrates after a design&#8208;of&#8208;experiment optimization.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#947;&#8208;Hydroxyasparagine: a Multifunctional Unnatural Amino Acid That is a Good P1 Substrate of Asparaginyl Peptide Ligases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptidyl Asparaginyl Ligases (PALs) are powerful tools for peptide macrocyclization. Herein, we report that a derivative of Asn, namely  N  &#947;  &#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;asparagine or Asn(OH), is an unnatural P1 substrate of PALs. Using Asn(OH)&#8208;mediated cyclization, we prepared cyclic peptides as new matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) inhibitors displaying the hydroxamic acid moiety of Asn(OH) as the key pharmacophore. Cyclic peptide  17  , the most potent of these (K  i  = 2.8 &#177; 0.5 nM), was built on the hyper&#8208;stable tetracyclic scaffold of rhesus theta defensin&#8208;1. The Asn(OH) residue in the cyclized peptides can also be readily oxidized to Asp. Using this approach, we synthesized several bioactive Asp&#8208;containing cyclic peptides (MCoTI&#8208;II, kB2, SFTI, and integrin&#8208;targeting RGD peptides) that are otherwise difficult targets for PAL&#8208;catalyzed cyclization due to unfavorable kinetics of the P1&#8208;Asp substrates. This study demonstrates that substrate engineering is a useful strategy to expand the application of PAL ligation in the synthesis of therapeutic cyclic peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective, Scalable Nickel&#8208;Electrocatalytic O&#8208;Arylation of Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly chemoselective O&#8208;arylation was achieved by electrochemically&#8208;driven nickel catalysis. This method exhibits broad substrate scope comparable to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pd, Cu and photochemically facilitated Ni catalysis. This e&#8208;etherification forged ether bonds in demanding settings where other methods failed. With its excellent scalability, this work represents a modular, mild, and simple ether bond formation for contemporary medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
The formation of aryl&#8208;alkyl ether bonds through cross coupling of alcohols with aryl halides represents a useful strategic departure from classical SN2 methods. Numerous tactics relying on Pd&#8208;, Cu&#8208;, and Ni&#8208;based catalytic systems have emerged over the past several years. Herein we disclose a Ni&#8208;catalyzed electrochemically driven protocol to achieve this useful transformation with a broad substrate scope in an operationally simple way. This electrochemical method does not require strong base, exogenous expensive transition metal catalysts (e.g., Ir, Ru), and can easily be scaled up in either a batch or flow setting. Interestingly, e&#8208;etherification exhibits an enhanced substrate scope over the mechanistically related photochemical variant as it tolerates tertiary amine functional groups in the alcohol nucleophile.

         <title>Optimizing Electrode/Electrolyte Interphases and Li&#8208;Ion Flux/Solvation for Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries with Qua&#8208;Functional Heptafluorobutyric Anhydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heptafluorobutyric anhydride (HFA) is proposed as qua&#8208;functional additive to optimize anode(cathode)/electrolyte interphases and Li&#8208;ion flux/solvation. The reduction/oxidation decomposition and high fluorine content of HFA facilitate the formation of a uniform inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) for depositing Li evenly, to form a compact cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) to reduce the dissolution of transition metal ions.







Abstract
The safety and electrochemical performance of rechargeable lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) are primarily influenced by the additives in the organic liquid electrolytes. However, multi&#8208;functional additives are still rarely reported. Herein, we proposed heptafluorobutyric anhydride (HFA) as a qua&#8208;functional additive to optimize the composition and structure of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The reduction/oxidation decomposition of the fluorine&#8208;rich HFA facilitate uniform inorganic&#8208;rich SEI and compact cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) formation, which enables stable lithium plating during charge and suppresses the dissolution of transition&#8208;metal ions. Moreover, HFA optimizes the Li&#8208;ion solvation for stable Li plating/stripping and serves as the surfactant to enhance the wettability of the separator by the electrolyte to increase Li&#8208;ion flux. The symmetric Li&#8741;Li cell with 1.0&#8197;wt&#8201;% HFA electrolyte had an excellent cycling performance over 340&#8197;h at 1.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a capacity of 0.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 while the Li&#8741;NCM622 cell maintained high capacity retention after 250&#8197;cycles and outstanding rate performance even at 15&#8197;C.

         <title>Exploring Ultrafast Photoswitching Pathways in RbMnFe Prussian Blue Analogue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;resolved optical spectroscopy combined to electronic band structure calculations reveal two photoinduced charge&#8208;transfer pathways for RbMnFe Prussian blue analogue. Photoexcitation of &#945; spins couples to reverse Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion that induces CT, while photoexcitation of &#946; spins induces Fe&#8594;Mn CT, stabilized by a spin transition. Lattice torsion modes play an important role for accommodating local distortions and stabilizing CT.







Abstract
We study by femtosecond optical pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy the photoinduced charge transfer (CT) in the RbMnFe Prussian blue analogue. Previous studies evidenced the local nature of the photoinduced MnIIIFeII &#8594; MnIIFeIII process, occurring within less than 1&#8197;ps. Here we show experimentally that two photoswitching pathways exist, depending on the excitation pump wavelength, which is confirmed by band structure calculations. Photoexcitation of &#945; spins corresponds to the Mn(d&#8208;d) band, which drives reverse Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion through the population of antibonding Mn&#8208;N orbitals, and induces CT within &#8776;190&#8197;fs. The process launches coherent lattice torsion during the self&#8208;trapping of the CT small&#8208;polaron. Photoexcitation of &#946; spins drives intervalence Fe&#8594;Mn CT towards non&#8208;bonding states and results in a slower dynamic.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We study by femtosecond optical pump-probe spectroscopy the photoinduced charge transfer (CT) in the RbMnFe Prussian blue analogue. Previous studies evidenced the local nature of the photoinduced Mn&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; &#8594; Mn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; process, occurring within less than 1&#8197;ps. Here we show experimentally that two photoswitching pathways exist, depending on the excitation pump wavelength, which is confirmed by band structure calculations. Photoexcitation of &#945; spins corresponds to the Mn(d-d) band, which drives reverse Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion through the population of antibonding Mn-N orbitals, and induces CT within &#8776;190&#8197;fs. The process launches coherent lattice torsion during the self-trapping of the CT small-polaron. Photoexcitation of &#946; spins drives intervalence Fe&#8594;Mn CT towards non-bonding states and results in a slower dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Engineering Fatty Acid Photodecarboxylase to Enable Highly Selective Decarboxylation of trans Fatty Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly&#8208;efficient removal of trans fatty acids from edible oils through decarboxylation catalyzed by engineered fatty acid photo&#8208;decarboxylase (CvFAP) is reported. The best mutant with a one&#8208;thousand&#8208;fold higher trans&#8208;over&#8208;cis selectivity for the model substrates than WT, was obtained through a rational engineering approach based on the FRISM strategy.







Abstract
Due to the high risk of heart disease caused by the intake of trans fatty acids, a method to eliminate trans fatty acids from foods has become a critical issue. Herein, we engineered fatty acid photo&#8208;decarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis (CvFAP) to selectively catalyze the decarboxylation of trans fatty acids to yield readily&#8208;removed hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide, while cis fatty acids remained unchanged. An efficient protein engineering based on FRISM strategy was implemented to intensify the electronic interaction between the residues and the double bond of the substrate that stabilized the binding of elaidic acid in the channel. For the model compounds, oleic acid and elaidic acid, the best mutant, V453E, showed a one&#8208;thousand&#8208;fold improvement in the trans&#8208;over&#8208;cis (ToC) selectivity compared with wild type (WT). As the first report of the direct biocatalytic decarboxylation resolution of trans/cis fatty acids, this work offers a safe, facile, and eco&#8208;friendly process to eliminate trans fatty acids from edible oils.

         <title>Opto&#8208;Electrochemical Dissolution Reveals Coccolith Calcium Carbonate Content</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acid dissolution enables 3D image reconstruction of coccoliths, providing mass estimation in the range of 2 to 400&#8197;picograms.







Abstract
Coccoliths are plates of biogenic calcium carbonate secreted by calcifying marine phytoplankton; annually these phytoplankton are responsible for exporting &gt;1 billion tonnes (1015&#8197;g) of calcite to the deep ocean. Rapid and reliable methods for assessing the degree of calcification are technically challenging because the coccoliths are micron sized and contain picograms (pg) of calcite. Here we pioneer an opto&#8208;eletrochemical acid titration of individual coccoliths which allows 3D reconstruction of each individual coccolith via in situ optical imaging enabling direct inference of the coccolith mass. Coccolith mass ranging from 2 to 400&#8197;pg are reported herein, evidencing both inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;species variation over four different species. We foresee this scientific breakthrough, which is independent of knowledge regarding the species and calibration&#8208;free, will allow continuous monitoring and reporting of the degree of coccolith calcification in the changing marine environment.

         <title>Single&#8208;Cell Imaging of m6A Modified RNA Using m6A&#8208;Specific In Situ Hybridization Mediated Proximity Ligation Assay (m6AISH&#8208;PLA)</title>

         <dc:description>
We design a m6A&#8208;specific in situ hybridization mediated proximity ligation assay (m6AISH&#8208;PLA) for in situ visualization of m6A modified RNA (m6A RNA) in single cells. This technique shows excellent recognition specificity of m6A modification at specific location in mRNA and in situ visualization ability of single&#8208;molecule resolution.







Abstract
N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) modification&#8212;the most prevalent mammalian RNA internal modification&#8212;plays key regulatory roles in mRNA metabolism. Current approaches for m6A modified RNA analysis limit at bulk&#8208;population level, resulting in a loss of spatiotemporal and cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell variability information. Here we proposed a m6A&#8208;specific in situ hybridization mediated proximity ligation assay (m6AISH&#8208;PLA) for cellular imaging of m6A RNA, allowing to identify m6A modification at specific location in RNAs and image m6A RNA with single&#8208;cell and single&#8208;molecule resolution. Using m6AISH&#8208;PLA, we investigated the m6A level and subcellular location of HSP70 RNA103&#8208;m6A in response to heat shock stress, and found an increased m6A modified ratio and an increased distribution ratio in cytoplasm under heat shock. m6AISH&#8208;PLA can serve in the study of m6A RNA in single cells for deciphering epitranscriptomic mechanisms and assisting clinical diagnosis.

         <title>Low&#8208;Valence Zn&#948;+ (0&lt;&#948;&lt;2) Single&#8208;Atom Material as Highly Efficient Electrocatalyst for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO2 reduction represents a promising approach to sustainably produce carbon&#8208;based chemicals and fuels but has been experiencing challenges in developing low&#8208;cost and efficient electrocatalysts. Herein, a nitrogen&#8208;stabilized single&#8208;atom catalyst containing low&#8208;valence zinc atoms (Zn&#948;+&#8208;NC) is reported. It is revealed that Zn&#948;+&#8208;NC contains a mixture of saturated four&#8208;coordinate (Zn&#8208;N4) and unsaturated three&#8209;coordinate (Zn&#8208;N3) sites. The latter makes Zn a low&#8209;valence state, as deduced from X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance, and density functional theory (DFT) simulation. As a result, Zn&#948;+&#8208;NC catalyzes electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO with near&#8208;unity selectivity in water at an overpotential as low as 310 mV. Importantly, a record&#8208;high current density up to 1 A cm&#8208;2 can be achieved together with high CO selectivity of &gt;95% using Zn&#948;+&#8208;NC in a flow cell reactor. DFT calculations suggest that the unsaturated Zn&#8208;N3 site could dramatically reduce the energy barrier by stabilizing the COOH* (* represents active sites) intermediate due to the electron&#8208;rich environment of Zn. This work not only sheds light on the relationship among coordination number, valence state, and catalytic performance of Zn single&#8209;atom sites, but also succeeds in achieving high current densities relevant for industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Synthetic routes to lithium, magnesium and zinc aluminyl complexes are reported, allowing for the first structural character&#8208;ization of a lithium&#8208;aluminium bond. Structural and quantum chemical studies are consistent with the presence of a highly polar Li&#8211;Al interaction, characterized by a low bond order and relatively little charge transfer from Al to Li. Comparison with the magnesium and zinc systems reveals changes to both the M&#8211;Al bond and the (NON)Al fragment consistent with greater covalent character, with the latter complex being shown to react with CO  2  &#160;via a pathway that implies that the&#160;  zinc  &#160;centre acts as the nucleophilic partner.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Frequency Fingerprint for Ion Interaction Networks in a Confined Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transport of molecules and ions through biological nanopores are governed by the interaction networks among the restricted ions, transported molecules and residue moieties at pore walls. However, identification of such weak ion fluctuations from only few tens of ions inside nanopore confinement is hardly to achieve due to measurement limitations. Here, we developed an advanced frequency method to achieve qualitative and spectral analysis of the ion interaction networks in a nanopore. Results demonstrated that the peak frequency  f  m  reveals the dissociation rate between nanopore and ions, while  a  m  depicts the number of combined ions with nanopore after an interaction equilibrium. We further established a mathematical model for single&#8208;molecule frequency fingerprint, which achieved prediction of interaction characteristics for mutant nanopores. This single&#8208;molecule frequency fingerprint is important for classification, characterization and prediction of synergetic interaction networks inside nanoconfinement, which holds a promise for high accurate nanopore DNA/protein sequencing.</dc:description>

         <title>Automated Electrical Quantification of Vitamin B1 in a Bodily Fluid using an Engineered Nanopore&#8208;Sensor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to measure the concentration of metabolites in biological samples is important, both in the clinic and for home diagnostics. Here we present a nanopore&#8208;based biosensor and automated data analysis for quantification of thiamine in urine in less than a minute, without the need for recalibration. For this we use the Cytolysin A nanopore and equip it with an engineered periplasmic thiamine binding protein (TbpA). To allow fast measurements we tuned the affinity of TbpA for thiamine by redesigning the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions between the thiazole group of thiamine and TbpA. This substitution resulted furthermore in a marked difference between unbound and bound state, allowing the reliable discrimination of thiamine from its two phosphorylated forms by residual current only. Using an array of nanopores, this allows the quantification within seconds, paving the way for next&#8208;generation single&#8208;molecule metabolite detection systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Excited Multicolor Afterglow in Carbon Dots&#8208;Based Room&#8208;Temperature Afterglow Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Room&#8208;temperature afterglow (RTA) materials with long lifetime have shown tremendous application prospects in many fields. However, there is no general design strategy to construct near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;excited multicolor RTA materials. Herein, we report a universal approach based on the efficient radiative energy transfer that supports the reabsorption from upconversion materials (UMs) to carbon dots&#8208;based RTA materials (CDAMs). Thus, the afterglow emission (blue, cyan, green, and orange) of various CDAMs can be activated by UMs under the NIR continuous&#8208;wave laser excitation. The efficient radiative energy transfer ensured the persistent multicolor afterglow up to 7 s, 6 s, 5 s, and 0.5 s by naked eyes, respectively. Given the unusual afterglow properties, we demonstrated preliminary applications in fingerprint recognition and information security. This work provides a new avenue for the activation of NIR&#8208;excited afterglow in CDAMs and will greatly expand the applications of RTA.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Selective Supramolecule Array Membrane Made of Zero&#8208;Dimensional Molecules for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Methylimidazole (mim) molecules were assembled into unprecedented supramolecule array membranes (SAMs) through vapor processing on closely packed MOF layers. Selective gas transport through the intermolecular spacing of mim (ca. 0.30&#8197;nm) is realized within SAMs, yielding an extremely precise sieving of H2 from CO2.







Abstract
We orderly assembled zero&#8208;dimensional 2&#8208;methylimidazole (mim) molecules into unprecedented supramolecule array membranes (SAMs) through solvent&#8208;free vapor processing, realizing the intermolecular spacing of mim at ca. 0.30&#8197;nm available as size&#8208;sieving channels for distinguishing the tiny difference between H2 (kinetic diameter: 0.289&#8197;nm) and CO2 (kinetic diameter: 0.33&#8197;nm). The highly oriented and dense membranes yield a separation factor above 3600 for equimolar H2/CO2 mixtures, which is one order of magnitude higher than those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes defining 2017&#8217;s upper bound for H2/CO2 separation. These SAMs define a new benchmark for molecular sieve membranes and are of paramount importance to precombustion carbon capture. Given the range of supramolecules, we anticipate SAMs with variable intermolecular channels could be applied in diversified separations that are prevalent in chemical processes.

         <title>Logic&#8208;Gated Proximity Aptasensing for Cell&#8208;Surface Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The logic&#8208;gated nanoplatform responds to cell environmental factors (H+ and K+) to manipulate a proximity aptasensor for the real&#8208;time monitoring of chemotherapeutics&#8208;induced cell apoptosis by capturing released endogenous ATP when it is anchored on the cell surface.







Abstract
In nature, intact apoptotic cells release ATP as a signaling molecule to trigger prompt phagocytic clearance, even at the earliest stage of apoptosis. Inspired by this, here we introduce a straightforward strategy for real&#8208;time monitoring ATP exocytosis and drug&#8208;stimulated apoptosis in the cancer cell surroundings. Triplex&#8208;boosted G&#8208;quadruplexes (tb&#8208;G4s) responding to cell environmental factors (H+ and K+) are engineered to construct a DNA logic&#8208;gated nanoplatform for proximity ATP aptasensing on the cell surface. It enables the real&#8208;time monitoring of cell apoptosis by capturing released endogenous ATP during chemotherapy drug stimulation, providing a sensitive approach for dynamically evaluating drug&#8208;induced apoptosis and therapeutic efficacy.

         <title>Advection&#8208;Enhanced Kinetics in Microtiter Plates for Improved Surface Assay Quantitation and Multiplexing Capabilities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flat solid&#8208;phase assays form the basis of modern medical diagnosis and continue to drive pioneering biological questions. Here, we bring micro&#8208;scale advection to these assays, thereby improving their sensitivity, time to results, multiplexing and information per test. We do this in standard microtiter plates, compatible with hundreds of commercially available kits for surface assay applications.







Abstract
Surface assays such as ELISA are pervasive in clinics and research and predominantly standardized in microtiter plates (MTP). MTPs provide many advantages but are often detrimental to surface assay efficiency due to inherent mass transport limitations. Microscale flows can overcome these and largely improve assay kinetics. However, the disruptive nature of microfluidics with existing labware and protocols has narrowed its transformative potential. We present WellProbe, a novel microfluidic concept compatible with MTPs. With it, we show that immunoassays become more sensitive at low concentrations (up to 9&#215; signal improvement in 12&#215; less time), richer in information with 3&#8211;4 different kinetic conditions, and can be used to estimate kinetic parameters, minimize washing steps and non&#8208;specific binding, and identify compromised results. We further multiplex single&#8208;well assays combining WellProbe's kinetic regions with tailored microarrays. Finally, we demonstrate our system in a context of immunoglobulin subclass evaluation, increasingly regarded as clinically relevant.

         <title>Li4MgGe2S7: The First Alkali and Alkaline&#8208;Earth Diamond&#8208;Like Infrared Nonlinear Optical Material with Exceptional Large Band Gap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first alkali and alkaline&#8208;earth compound with diamond&#8208;like structure, Li4MgGe2S7, was rationally designed and synthesized. The title compound, exhibiting wide band gap (4.12&#8197;eV) and good phase&#8208;matchable SHG response (0.7&#215;AGS), is a promising IR NLO material for high power laser application.







Abstract
Large band gap and strong nonlinear optical (NLO) effect are two valuable but contradictory parameters, which are difficult to balance in one infrared (IR) NLO material. Herein, the first alkali and alkaline&#8208;earth metal diamond&#8208;like (DL) IR NLO material Li4MgGe2S7, presenting a honeycomb&#8208;like 3D framework constructed by 6&#8208;membered LiS4 rings and GeMgS6 zigzag chains, was rationally designed and synthesized. The introduction of rigid alkali metal and alkaline&#8208;earth metal LiS4 and MgS4 tetrahedra effectively broadens the band gap of DL compound to 4.12&#8197;eV (the largest one in the reported quaternary metal chalcogenides), generating a high laser damage threshold of 7 &#215; AgGaS2 at 1064&#8197;nm. Furthermore, Li4MgGe2S7 displays a suitable SHG response (0.7 &#215; AgGaS2) with a type I phase&#8208;matching behavior. The results indicate that Li4MgGe2S7 is a promising IR NLO material for the high&#8208;power laser application and it provides an insight into the design of new DL compound with outstanding IR NLO performances.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence from TADF&#8208;Sensitized Fluorescent Enantiomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A couple of fluorescent enantiomers with high PLQY of 98&#8201;% and mirror&#8208;imaged CPL activities have been developed to fabricate TADF&#8208;sensitized CP&#8208;OLEDs. The resulting devices not only display intense CPEL with |gEL| of about 1.8&#215;10&#8722;3, but also show high EQEmax of 21.5&#8201;% with remarkably low efficiency roll&#8208;off, whose EQE is 15.3&#8201;% even at 10&#8201;000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
A couple of fluorescent enantiomers, which are suitable for the emitters of high&#8208;efficiency TADF&#8208;sensitized CP&#8208;OLEDs, have been developed. The enantiomers show configurational stability, high PLQY of 98&#8201;%, large kr of 7.8&#215;107&#8197;s&#8722;1, and intense CPL activities with |glum| values of about 2.5&#215;10&#8722;3. Notably, by using matchable TADF sensitizer, the enantiomers were then exploited as emitter to fabricate CP&#8208;OLEDs. The TADF&#8208;sensitized CP&#8208;OLEDs not only show mirror&#8208;image CPEL activities with gEL values of +1.8&#215;10&#8722;3 and &#8722;1.4&#215;10&#8722;3, but also display fast start&#8208;up featuring with low VT of 3.0&#8197;V as well as driving voltage of 4.8&#8197;V at 10&#8201;000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. Meaningfully, the TADF&#8208;sensitized fluorescent devices show high EQEmax of 21.5&#8201;% and extremely low efficiency roll&#8208;off, whose EQEs are 21.2&#8201;% and 15.3&#8201;% at 1000 and 10&#8201;000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, respectively. The obtained EQEs are comparable to those of CP&#8208;TADF emitters, which provides a promising perspective to break through the EL efficiency limit of CP&#8208;FL emitters.

         <title>Boosting Photoacoustic Effect via Intramolecular Motions Amplifying Thermal&#8208;to&#8208;Acoustic Conversion Efficiency for Adaptive Image&#8208;Guided Cancer Surgery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A compound with intense intramolecular motions exhibits an amplified photoacoustic signal by specifically elevating the thermal&#8208;to&#8208;acoustic conversion efficiency, and the fluorescence brightness also increases due to the aggregation&#8208;induced emission signature. Precise in vivo image&#8208;guided cancer surgery in different stages is conducted, greatly boosting the surgery outcome.







Abstract
Photoacoustic (PA) imaging emerges as a promising technique for biomedical applications. The development of new strategies to boost PA conversion without depressing other properties (e.g., fluorescence) is highly desirable for multifunctional imaging but difficult to realize. Here, we report a new phenomenon that active intramolecular motions could promote PA signal by specifically increasing thermal&#8208;to&#8208;acoustic conversion efficiency. The compound with intense intramolecular motion exhibits amplified PA signal by elevating thermal&#8208;to&#8208;acoustic conversion, and the fluorescence also increases due to aggregation&#8208;induced emission signature. The simultaneously high PA and fluorescence brightness of TPA&#8208;TQ3 NPs enable precise image&#8208;guided surgery. The preoperative fluorescence and PA imaging are capable of locating orthotopic breast tumor in a high&#8208;contrast manner, and the intraoperative fluorescence imaging delineates tiny residual tumors. This study highlights a new design guideline of intramolecular motion amplifying PA effect.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: Molecules or Semiconductors in Photocatalysis?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) offer unique possibilities for the rational engineering of tailored physical properties. Nevertheless, the molecular and porous nature of MOFs leaves the field juxtapositioned between semiconductor physics and homogeneous photocatalysis. This Review reflects on how MOFs can resemble conventional semiconductors and how they are more like infinite molecules in solution.







Abstract
In the realm of solids, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) offer unique possibilities for the rational engineering of tailored physical properties. These derive from the modular, molecular make&#8208;up of MOFs, which allows for the selection and modification of the organic and inorganic building units that construct them. The adaptable properties make MOFs interesting materials for photocatalysis, an area of increasing significance. But the molecular and porous nature of MOFs leaves the field, in some areas, juxtapositioned between semiconductor physics and homogeneous photocatalysis. While descriptors from both fields are applied in tandem, the gap between theory and experiment has widened in some areas, and arguably needs fixing. Here we review where MOFs have been shown to be similar to conventional semiconductors in photocatalysis, and where they have been shown to be more like infinite molecules in solution. We do this from the perspective of band theory, which in the context of photocatalysis, covers both the molecular and nonmolecular principles of relevance.

We do this from the perspective of band theory, which in the context of photocatalysis, covers both the molecular and nonmolecular principles of relevance.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Surface Coordination Interphase Stabilizes a Solid&#8208;State Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nitrile group&#8208;induced coordination interphase on the surface of the LLZTO electrolyte stabilizes the electrolyte/electrode interface.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) show potential in addressing the safety issues of liquid batteries, but the poor interface contact between them and the electrodes hinders practical applications. Here, coordination chemistry of nitrile groups based on succinonitrile (SCN) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) is studied on the surface of Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO) SSE to build the chemical bonded electrolyte/electrode interfaces. The coordination of the nitrile group and LLZTO is clarified. A deformable PAN&#8208;modifying SCN electrolyte (PSE) interphase with stable ionic conductivity (10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and high lithium&#8208;ion transference number (0.66) is fabricated on the surface of LLZTO electrolyte based on the coordination competition of nitrile groups. Once applied to SSBs, it endows low interface resistance and strong bonding for the electrolyte/electrode interfaces so that the initial Coulomb efficiency reaches 95.6&#8201;% and the capacity remains 99&#8201;% after 250 cycles at 25&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Spontaneous Enhancement of Magnetic Resonance Signals Using a RASER</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce the combination of para&#8208;hydrogen enhanced magnetic resonance with the phenomenon of the RASER and spontaneous polarization transfer: Large signals of para&#8208;hydrogen enhanced molecules interact with the magnetic resonance coil in a way that the signal is spontaneously converted into an in&#8208;phase signal. These molecules directly interact with other compounds via dipolar couplings and enhance their signal.







Abstract
Nuclear magnetic resonance is usually drastically limited by its intrinsically low sensitivity: Only a few spins contribute to the overall signal. To overcome this limitation, hyperpolarization methods were developed that increase signals several times beyond the normal/thermally polarized signals. The ideal case would be a universal approach that can signal enhance the complete sample of interest in solution to increase detection sensitivity. Here, we introduce a combination of para&#8208;hydrogen enhanced magnetic resonance with the phenomenon of the RASER: Large signals of para&#8208;hydrogen enhanced molecules interact with the magnetic resonance coil in a way that the signal is spontaneously converted into an in&#8208;phase signal. These molecules directly interact with other compounds via dipolar couplings and enhance their signal. We demonstrate that this is not only possible for solvent molecules but also for an amino acid.

         <title>Energy Platform for Directed Charge Transfer in the Cascade Z&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction: CO2 Photoreduction without a Cocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cascade Z&#8208;Scheme system composed of a dimension&#8208;matched (001)TiO2&#8208;g&#8208;C3N4/BiVO4 heterojunction is proposed, in which the energy platform (001)TiO2 is used to direct charge transfer and separation, thus blocking the unexpected type&#8208;II charge transfer pathway. The role of TiO2 is thus not only to facilitate the Z&#8208;Scheme charge transfer but also to maintain the strong redox potentials for CO2 photoreduction and water splitting.







Abstract
A universal strategy is developed to construct a cascade Z&#8208;Scheme system, in which an effective energy platform is the core to direct charge transfer and separation, blocking the unexpected type&#8208;II charge transfer pathway. The dimension&#8208;matched (001)TiO2&#8208;g&#8208;C3N4/BiVO4 nanosheet heterojunction (T&#8208;CN/BVNS) is the first such model. The optimized cascade Z&#8208;Scheme exhibits &#8776;19&#8208;fold photoactivity improvement for CO2 reduction to CO in the absence of cocatalysts and costly sacrificial agents under visible&#8208;light irradiation, compared with BVNS, which is also superior to other reported Z&#8208;Scheme systems even with noble metals as mediators. The experimental results and DFT calculations based on van der Waals structural models on the ultrafast timescale reveal that the introduced T as the platform prolongs the lifetimes of spatially separated electrons and holes and does not compromise their reduction and oxidation potentials.

         <title>Tandem Catalytic Indolization/Enantioconvergent Substitution of Alcohols by Borrowing Hydrogen to Access Tricyclic Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient cascade indolization/enantioconvergent borrowing hydrogen is achieved for the construction of chiral 2,3&#8208;fused tricyclic indoles, enabled by relay and cooperative catalysis of a chiral iridium complex with a chiral phosphoric acid. Highly diastereoselective transformations of the tricyclic indole products also provide efficient access to a diverse array of complex polycyclic indolines.







Abstract
An efficient tandem catalysis method is achieved for the direct conversion of alcohol&#8208;containing alkynyl anilines to valuable chiral 2,3&#8208;fused tricyclic indoles. This method relies on a tandem indolization followed by enantioconvergent substitution of alcohols via borrowing hydrogen to construct two rings in one step, enabled by relay and cooperative catalysis of a chiral iridium complex with a chiral phosphoric acid. Highly diastereoselective transformations of the tricyclic indole products also provide efficient access to a diverse array of complex polycyclic indoline compounds.

         <title>Arylamine&#8208;Linked 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Pseudocapacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To expand the diversity of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and to explore their potential applications, new arylamine linkage for the construction of COFs have been developed. The abundant electroactive diphenylamine moieties in the COF skeletons resembling that of polyaniline (PANI) enable efficient pseudocapacitive energy storage. Remarkably, the AAm&#8208;TPB electrode exhibited a high capacitance of 271&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
The development of new linkages is one of the most efficient strategies to enrich the diversity of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Particularly, functional linkages can endow COFs with additional tailored properties besides the building units, which further diversify COFs with desirable functions. Herein, we have developed a new arylamine linkage for the construction of COFs. Two new arylamine&#8208;linked COFs (AAm&#8208;TPB and AAm&#8208;Py) were prepared by condensing cost&#8208;effective dimethyl succinyl succinate (DMSS) with corresponding multitopic amines (TPB&#8208;NH2 and Py&#8208;NH2). Due to the abundant electroactive diphenylamine moieties in the COF skeletons resembling that of polyaniline (PANI), a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art conductive polymer, the pseudocapacitive energy storage performance of AAm&#8208;TPB was further investigated. Remarkably, the AAm&#8208;TPB electrode exhibits a high capacitance of 271&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a three&#8208;electrode setup at a discharge rate of 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, which represents one of the highest capacitances among the reported COF&#8208;based electrode materials.

         <title>Functional Switch and Ethyl Group Formation in the Bacterial Polytrichastrene Synthase from Chryseobacterium polytrichastri</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linalool synthase from Chryseobacterium polytrichastri was found to have diterpene synthase activity and produced diterpenes with new skeletons containing a rare ethyl group. Its formation was mechanistically studied through isotopic labeling and DFT calculations. Exchange of active site residues resulted in a functional switch leading to additional novel diterpenes. This work lays the ground for future rational engineering of terpene synthases.







Abstract
A reinvestigation of the linalool synthase from Chryseobacterium polytrichastri uncovered its diterpene synthase activity, yielding polytrichastrene&#8197;A and polytrichastrol&#8197;A with new skeletons, besides known wanju&#8208;2,5&#8208;diene and thunbergol. The enzyme mechanism was investigated by isotopic labeling experiments and DFT calculations to explain an unusual ethyl group formation. Rationally designed exchanges of active site residues showed major functional switches, resulting for I66F in the production of five more new compounds, including polytrichastrene&#8197;B and polytrichastrol&#8197;B, while A87T, A192V and the double exchange A87T, A192V gave a product shift towards wanju&#8208;2,5&#8208;diene.

         <title>Parahydrogen&#8208;Induced Polarization of Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amino acids and peptides are vital elements of metabolic and proteomic regulations. Non&#8208;invasive NMR and MRI techniques are highly suited for metabolomics diagnostics, but lack sufficient sensitivity. This Minireview summarizes the considerable advances in signal amplification through parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization of amino acids and peptides.







Abstract
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has become a universal method for biochemical and biomedical studies, including metabolomics, proteomics, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). By increasing the signal of selected molecules, the hyperpolarization of nuclear spin has expanded the reach of NMR and MRI even further (e.g. hyperpolarized solid&#8208;state NMR and metabolic imaging in&#8197;vivo). Parahydrogen (pH2) offers a fast and cost&#8208;efficient way to achieve hyperpolarization, and the last decade has seen extensive advances, including the synthesis of new tracers, catalysts, and transfer methods. The portfolio of hyperpolarized molecules now includes amino acids, which are of great interest for many applications. Here, we provide an overview of the current literature and developments in the hyperpolarization of amino acids and peptides.

         <title>Resolution of Lithium Deposition versus Intercalation of Graphite Anodes in Lithium Ion Batteries: An In Situ Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ EPR cell with a well&#8208;defined electrochemical response is designed to understand the lithiation/deposition behavior occurring on the graphite anode of the Li&#8208;ion battery. Li deposition on the graphite electrode occurs at +0.04&#8197;V (vs. Li+/Li) at a scan rate of 0.04&#8197;mV&#8201;s&#8722;1. The safe cut&#8208;off potential limit for the anode during high rate cycling and inhibition of Li deposition by a vinylene carbonate additive are revealed by in situ EPR.







Abstract
In situ electrochemical electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is used to understand the mixed lithiation/deposition behavior on graphite anodes during the charging process. The conductivity, degree of lithiation, and the deposition process of the graphite are reflected by the EPR spectroscopic quality factor, the spin density, and the EPR spectral change, respectively. Classical over&#8208;charging (normally associated with potentials &#8804;0&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li) are not required for Li metal deposition onto the graphite anode: Li deposition initiates at ca. +0.04&#8197;V (vs. Li+/Li) when the scan rate is lowered to 0.04&#8197;mV&#8201;s&#8722;1. The inhibition of Li deposition by vinylene carbonate (VC) additive is highlighted by the EPR results during cycling, attributed to a more mechanically flexible and polymeric SEI layer with higher ionic conductivity. A safe cut&#8208;off potential limit of +0.05&#8197;V for the anode is suggested for high rate cycling, confirmed by the EPR response over prolonged cycling.

         <title>Doxorubicin&#8208;sensitized Luminescence of NIR&#8208;emitting Ytterbium Liposomes: Towards Direct Monitoring of Drug Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Drug&#8208;loaded liposomes are typical examples of nanomedicine. We show here that doxorubicin, the anti&#8208;cancer agent in the liposomal drug Doxil  &#174;  , can sensitize Ytterbium (Yb  3+  ) and generate its near infrared (NIR) emission. When doxorubicin and amphiphilic Yb  3+  chelates are incorporated into liposomes, the sensitized emission of Yb  3+  is dependent on the integrity of the particles which can be used to monitor drug release. We also established the first demonstration that the NIR Yb  3+  emission signal is observable in living mice following intratumoral injection of the Yb  3+  &#8208;doxorubicin&#8208;liposomes, using a commercial macroscopic setup equipped with a near&#8208;infrared camera.</dc:description>

         <title>Steric Hindrance Drives the Boron&#8208;Initiated Polymerization of Dienyltriphenylarsonium Ylides to Photoluminescent C5&#8208;polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of alkyl&#8208;subsituted dienyltriphenylarsonium ylides were synthesized and used as monomers in borane&#8208;initiated polymerization to obtain practically C5&#8208;polymers (main&#8208;chain grows by five carbon atoms at a time). The impact of triethylborane (Et  3  B), tributylborane (Bu  3  B), tri&#8208;  sec  &#8208;butylborane (  s&#8208;  Bu  3  B), and triphenylborane (Ph  3  B) initiators on C5 polymerization was studied. Based on NMR and SEC results, we have shown that all synthesized polymers have C5 units with a unique unsaturated backbone where two conjugated double bonds are separated by one methylene. The synthesized C5&#8208;polymers possess predictable molecular weights and narrow molecular weight distributions (  M  n,NMR  = 2.8 &#8208;11.9 kg mol  &#8208;1  ,  &#208;  = 1.04&#8208;1.24). It has been found that increasing the steric hindrance of both the monomer and the initiator can facilitate the formation of more C5 repeating units, thus driving the polymerization to almost pure C5&#8208;polymer (up to 95.8%). The polymerization mechanism was studied by  11  B NMR and confirmed by DFT calculations. The synthesized C5&#8208;polymers are amorphous with tunable glass&#8208;transition temperatures by adjusting the substituents of monomers, ranging from +30.1 &#176;C to &#8722;38.4 &#176;C. Furthermore, they possess blue photoluminescence that changes to yellow illuminating the polymers for 5 days with UV radiation of 365 nm (IIE, isomerization induced emission).</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Ultraviolet Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diode Enabled by High&#8208;Lying Reverse Intersystem Crossing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultraviolet (UV) organic emitters that can open up applications for future organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are of great value but rarely developed. Here, we report a high&#8208;quality UV emitter with hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) excited state and its application in UV OLEDs. The UV emitter, 2BuCz&#8208;CNCz, shows the features of low&#8208;lying locally&#8208;excited (LE) emissive state and high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing (hRISC) process, which helps to balance the color purity and exciton utilization of UV OLED. Consequently, the OLED based on 2BuCz&#8208;CNCz exhibits not only a desired narrowband UV electroluminescent (EL) at 396 nm with satisfactory color purity (CIEx, y = 0.161, 0.031), but also a record&#8208;high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 10.79% with small efficiency roll&#8208;off. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device performance can inspire the design of UV emitters, and pave a way for the further development of high performance UV OLEDs.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Phase Separation into Coupled Interfaces for Promoting CO2 Electroreduction to Formate over a Wide Potential Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bimetallic sulfides are expected to realize efficient CO2 electroreduction into formate over a wide potential window, however, will undergo in situ structural evolution under the reaction conditions. Therefore, clarifying the structural evolution process, the real active site and the catalytic mechanism appear significance. Here, taking Cu2SnS3 as an example, we unveiled that Cu2SnS3 occurred self&#8208;adapted phase separation toward forming the stable SnO2@CuS and SnO2@Cu2O heterojunction during the electrochemical process. Theoretical calculations illustrated that the strongly coupled interfaces as real active sites driven the electron self&#8208;flow from Sn4+ to Cu+, thereby promoting the delocalized Sn sites to combine HCOO* with H*. Cu2SnS3 nanosheets achieve over 83.4% formate selectivity in a wide potential range from &#8208;0.6 V to &#8208;1.1 V. Our findings provide insight into the structural evolution process and performance&#8208;enhanced origin of ternary sulfides under the CO2 electroreduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Activity&#160;Trends and Mechanisms in Peroxymonosulfate&#8208;Assisted Catalytic Production of Singlet Oxygen over Atomic Metal&#8208;N&#8208;C Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;assisted advanced oxidation processes catalyzed by transition metal compounds have become state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art technologies for water treatment, especially the atomic metal&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts. In contrast, less attention has been paid to carbon&#8208;supported atomic metal&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts with different transition metal centers to understand&#160;the transition metals' nature on the PMS&#8208;assisted catalytic activities and trends toward reactive oxygen species production. Here we synthesized&#160;a series of carbon&#8208;supported atomic metal&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts&#160;(named as M&#8208;SACs, M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) with&#160;similar structural and physicochemical properties&#160;to&#160;experimentally and theoretically uncover their catalytic activity trends and mechanisms. The PMS catalytic activity trends are Fe&#8208;SAC&gt;Co&#8208;SAC&gt;Mn&#8208;SAC&gt;Ni&#8208;SAC&gt;Cu&#8208;SAC, and&#160;Fe&#8208;SAC displays the best single&#8208;site kinetic value (1.65*105  &#160;min&#8208;1  &#160;mol&#8208;1  ) compared to the other&#160;metal&#8208;N&#8208;C species. Our first&#8208;principles calculations indicate that the most reasonable reaction pathway&#160;for  1O2  &#160;production&#160;is PMS&#8594;OH*&#8594;O*&#8594;  1O2  ; meanwhile, M&#8208;SACs that exhibit the moderate and near&#8208;average Gibbs free energies in each reaction step own a better catalytic activity, which is the key for the outstanding performance&#160;of Fe&#8208;SACs. This study gives the atomic&#8208;scale understanding of fundamental catalytic&#160;trends and mechanisms of PMS&#8208;assisted&#160;reactive oxygen species production via M&#8208;SACs, thus providing new guidance for developing M&#8208;SACs for future catalytic organic pollutant degradation.</dc:description>

         <title>Inhibition of S. aureus&#8208;Infection of HUVECs by Trehalose and Glucose&#8208;functionalized Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microbial adhesion to host cells represents the initial step in the infection process. Several methods have been explored to inhibit microbial adhesion including the use of glycopolymers based on mannose, galactose, sialic acid and glucose. These sugar receptors are however abundant in the body and they are not unique to bacteria. Trehalose in contrast is a unique disaccharide that is wildly expressed by microbes. This carbohydrate has not yet been explored as an anti&#8208;adhesive. Herein, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) coated with trehalose&#8208;based polymers were prepared and compared to glucose&#8208;functionalized AuNPs and examined for their ability to prevent binding to endothelial cells. Acting as anti&#8208;adhesive, trehalose&#8208;functionalized nanoparticles decreased the binding of  S. aureus  to HUVEC cells, while outperforming the control nanoparticles. Microscopy revealed that trehalose coated nanoparticle bound strongly to  S. aureus  compared to the controls. In conclusion, nanoparticles based on trehalose could be a non&#8208;toxic alternative to inhibit  S. aureus  infection.</dc:description>

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Radical Covalent Organic Frameworks as Highly Efficient and Stable Catalysts for Selective Oxidation of Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With excellent designability, large accessible inner surface, and high chemical stability, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising candidates as metal&#8208;free heterogeneous catalysts. In this work, we for the first time report two three&#8208;dimensional (3D) radical&#8208;based COFs, termed JUC&#8208;565 and JUC&#8208;566, in which radical moieties (2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxy, TEMPO) are uniformly decorated on the channel walls via a bottom&#8208;up approach. Based on grafted functional groups and suitable regular channels, these materials open up the application of COFs as highly efficient and selective metal&#8208;free redox catalysts in aerobic oxidation of alcohols to relevant aldehydes or ketones with outstanding turn over frequency (TOF) up to 132 h  &#8208;1  , which has exceeded other TEMPO&#8208;modified catalytic materials tested under similar conditions. Meanwhile, these stable COF&#8208;based catalysts could be easily recovered and reused for multiple runs. This study thus promotes potential applications of 3D functional COFs anchored with stable radicals in organic synthesis and material science.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of a Bromodomain&#8208;like region in 15&#8208;Lipoxygenase&#8208;1 explains its Nuclear Localization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lipoxygenase (LOX) activity provides oxidative lipid metabolites, which are involved in inflammatory disorders and tumorigenesis. Activity&#8208;based probes to detect the activity of LOX enzymes in their cellular context provide opportunities to explore LOX biology and LOX inhibition. Here, we developed  Labelox B  as a potent covalent LOX inhibitor for one&#8208;step activity&#8208;based labelling of proteins with LOXs activity.  Labelox B  was used to establish an ELISA&#8208;based assay for affinity capture and antibody&#8208;based detection of specific LOX isoenzymes. Moreover,  Labelox B  enabled efficient activity&#8208;based labeling of endogenous LOXs in living cells. LOX proved to localize in the nucleus, which was rationalized by identification of a functional bromodomain&#8208;like consensus motif in 15&#8208;LOX&#8208;1. This indicates that 15&#8208;LOX&#8208;1 is not only involved in oxidative lipid metabolism, but also in chromatin binding, which suggests a potential role in chromatin modifications.</dc:description>

         <title>Exporting Metal&#8208;Carbene Chemistry to Live Mammalian Cells: Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Intracellular Synthesis of Quinoxalines Enabled by N&#8208;H Carbene Insertions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Implementing catalytic organometallic transformations in living settings can offer unprecedented opportunities in chemical biology and medicine. Unfortunately, the number of biocompatible reactions so far discovered is very limited, and essentially restricted to uncaging processes. Here, we demonstrate the viability of performing catalytic metal carbene transfer reactions in live mammalian cells. In particular, we show that copper (II) catalysts can promote the intracellular annulation of alpha&#8208;keto diazocarbenes with ortho&#8208;amino arylamines, in a process that is initiated by an N&#8208;H carbene insertion. The potential of this transformation is underscored by the  in cellulo  synthesis of a product that alters mitochondrial functions, and by demonstrating cell selective biological responses using targeted copper catalysts. Considering the wide reactivity spectrum of metal carbenes, this work opens the door to significantly expanding the repertoire of life&#8208;compatible abiotic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Practical Chemoselective Acylation: Organocatalytic Chemodivergent Esterification and Amidation of Amino Alcohols with N&#8208;Carbonylimidazoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemoselective transformations are a cornerstone of efficient organic synthesis; however, achieving this goal for even simple transformations like acylations is often a challenge. We report that  N  &#8208;carbonylimidazoles undergo catalytic chemodivergent acylations of anilines or alcohols in the presence of pyridinium ions or DBU (1,8&#8208;Diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene), respectively. Both of these acylations display simultaneously high and broad chemoselectivity for the target group. Unprecedented levels of chemoselectivity were achieved in the DBU&#8208;catalyzed esterification: a single esterification product was obtained from a molecule containing primary aniline, alcohol, phenol, secondary amide, and  N&#8208;  H indole groups. These acylations are highly practical as they involve only readily available, inexpensive, and relatively safe reagents; can be performed at the multigram scale; and can be used on carboxylic acids directly via  in situ  formation of the acylimidazole electrophile. Reaction discovery, scope, assessment of practicality, and preliminary mechanistic investigations are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Implanting Numerous Hydrogen&#8208;bonding Networks in Cu&#8208;porphyrin based Nanosheet to Boost CH4 Selectivity in Neutral Media CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exploration of novel electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) systems in the production of hydrocarbons like CH4 has remained a giant challenge. Well&#8208;designed electrocatalysts with advantages like proton generation/transferring and intermediate&#8208;fixating for efficient CO2RR are much preferred yet largely unmet. In this work, a kind of Cu&#8208;porphyrin based large&#8208;scale (~1.5 &#956;m) and ultrathin nanosheet (~5 nm) has been successfully applied in electrochemical CO2RR. It exhibits a superior FECH4 of 70% with large current&#8208;density (&#8208;183.0 mA cm&#8208;2) at &#8208;1.6 V under rarely reported neutral condition and keeps higher than 51% over a wide potential range (&#8208;1.5 to &#8208;1.7 V) in flow&#8208;cell. The high performance can be attributed to the construction of numerous hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks through the integration of diaminotriazine with Cu&#8208;porphyrin, which is much beneficial for the proton&#8208;migration and intermediate&#8208;stabilization as certified by the DFT calculations. This work paves a new way in exploring hydrogen&#8208;bonding based materials as efficient CO2RR catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>A Tale of Two Isomers: Enhanced Antiaromaticity/Diradical Character versus Deleterious Ring&#8208;Opening of Benzofuran&#8208;fused s&#8208;Indacenes and Dicyclopenta[b,g]naphthalenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We examine the effects of fusing two benzofurans to  s  &#8208;indacene (indacenodibenzofurans, IDBFs) and dicyclopenta[  b,g  ]&#8208;naphthalene (indenoindenodibenzofurans, IIDBFs) to control the strong antiaromaticity and diradical character of these core units. Synthesis via 3&#8208;functionalized benzofuran yields  syn  &#8208;IDBF and  syn  &#8208;IIDBF.  syn  &#8208;IDBF possesses a high degree of paratropicity, exceeding that of the parent hydrocarbon, which in turn results in strong diradical character for  syn  &#8208;IIDBF. In the case of the  anti  &#8208;isomers, synthesized via 2&#8208;substituted benzofurans, these effects are decreased; however, both derivatives undergo an unexpected ring&#8208;opening reaction during the final dearomatization step. All the results are compared to the benzothiophene&#8208;fused analogues and show that the increased electronegativity of oxygen in the  syn  &#8208;fused derivatives leads to enhancement of the antiaromatic core causing greater paratropicity. For  syn  &#8208;IIDBF increased diradical character results from rearomatization of the core naphthalene unit in order to relieve this paratropicity.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid access to ordered mesoporous carbons for chemical hydrogen storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ordered mesoporous carbon materials offer robust network of organized pores for energy storage and catalysis applications, but suffer from time&#8208;consuming and intricate preparations hindering their widespread use. Here we report a new and rapid synthetic route for a N&#8208;doped ordered mesoporous carbon structure through a preferential heating of iron oxide nanoparticles by microwaves. A nanoporous covalent organic polymer is first formed in situ covering the hard templates of assembled nanoparticles, paving the way for a long&#8208;range order in a carbonaceous nanocomposite precursor. Upon removal of the template, a well&#8208;defined cubic mesoporous carbon structure was revealed. The ordered mesoporous carbon was used in solid state hydrogen storage as a host scaffold for NaAlH  4  , where remarkable improvement in hydrogen desorption kinetics was observed. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lowest activation energy of dehydrogenation as single step was attributed to their ordered pore structure and N&#8208;doping effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Interpenetration symmetry control within ultramicroporous robust boron cluster hybrid MOFs for benchmark purification of acetylene from carbon dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The separation of C2H2/CO2 is an important process in industry but challenged by the trade&#8208;off of capacity and selectivity owning to their similar physical properties and identical kinetic molecular size. Herein, we report the first example of symmetrically interpenetrated dodecaborate pillared MOF, ZNU&#8208;1, for benchmark selective separation of C2H2 from CO2 with a high C2H2 capacity of 76.3 cm3 g&#8208;1 and record C2H2/CO2 selectivity of 56.6 (298 K, 1 bar) among all the robust porous materials without open metal sites. Single crystal structure analysis and modelling study indicated that the interpenetration shifting from asymmetric to symmetric mode provided optimal pore chemistry with ideal synergistic &#8220;2+2&#8221; dihydrogen bonding sites for tight C2H2 trapping. The exceptional separation performance was further evidenced by simulated and experimental breakthroughs with excellent recyclability and high productivity (2.4 mol/kg) of 99.5% purity C2H2 during stepped desorption process.</dc:description>

         <title>Selection of macrocyclic peptides that bind STING from an mRNA&#8208;display library with split degenerate codons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent improvements in mRNA display have enabled selection of peptides that incorporate non&#8208;natural amino acids, thus expanding chemical diversity of macrocycles beyond what is accessible in nature. Such libraries have incorporated non&#8208;natural amino acids at the expense of natural amino acids, by reassigning their codons. Here we report an alternative approach to expanded amino&#8208;acid diversity, which preserves all 19 natural amino acids (no methionine) and adds 6 non&#8208;natural amino acids, resulting in the highest sequence complexity reported to date. We have applied mRNA display to this 25&#8208;letter library to select functional macrocycles that bind human STING, a protein involved in immunoregulation. The resulting STING&#8208;binding peptides include a 9&#8208;mer macrocycle with a dissociation constant (KD) of 3.4 nM, which blocks binding of cGAMP to STING and induces STING dimerization. This approach is generalizable to expanding the amino&#8208;acid alphabet in a library beyond 25 building blocks.</dc:description>

         <title>An Open&#8208;Shell Coronoid with Hybrid Chichibabin&#8211;Schlenk Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A hexaradicaloid molecule with alternating Kekul&#233; and non&#8208;Kekul&#233; connectivities between adjacent spin centers was obtained by fusing two classic conjugation motifs, found respectively in the Chichibabin and Schlenk hydrocarbons, into a coronoid structure.  1  H NMR, ESR and SQUID experiments, combined with computational analyses reveal that the system has a singlet ground state, characterized by a significant hexaradicaloid character (  &#947;  0  = 0.826,  &#947;  1  =  &#947;  2  = 0.773). It possesses multiple thermally accessible high&#8208;spin states (up to the septet), with uniform energy gaps of ca 1.0 kcal/mol between consecutive multiplicities. In line with its open&#8208;shell character, the coronoid has a small electronic bandgap of ca. 0.8 eV and undergoes two consecutive one&#8208;electron oxidations at low potentials, yielding cationic forms with extended near&#8208;infrared absorption. The hexaradicaloid, which combines open&#8208;shell and macrocyclic contributions to its &#960; conjugation, provides an example of a design strategy for multistate spin switches and redox&#8208;amphoteric NIR dyes.</dc:description>

         <title>How Aromatic Are Molecular Nanorings? The Case of a Six&#8208;Porphyrin Nanoring**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The correct assessment of the aromaticity of a 78&#960;&#8208;electron six&#8208;porphyrin nanoring hinges upon the choice of the computational method. Density functional approximations with a low percentage of long&#8208;range Hartree&#8211;Fock exchange commit large delocalization errors and suggest the presence of an aromatic ring current. The transition from the porphyrins to the bridging butadiyne linkers is responsible for the absence of an aromatic ring current.







Abstract
Large conjugated rings with persistent currents are novel promising structures in molecular&#8208;scale electronics. A six&#8208;porphyrin nanoring structure that allegedly sustained an aromatic ring current involving 78&#960; electrons was recently synthesized. We provide here compelling evidence that this molecule is not aromatic, contrary to what was inferred from the analysis of 1H&#8208;NMR data and computational calculations that suffer from large delocalization errors. The main reason behind the absence of an aromatic ring current in these nanorings is the low delocalization in the transition from the porphyrins to the bridging butadiyne linkers, which disrupts the overall conjugated circuit. These results highlight the importance of choosing a suitable computational method to study large conjugated molecules and the appropriate aromaticity descriptors to identify the part of the molecule responsible for the loss of aromaticity.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are a novel class of porous materials that showing a great potential for biological applications. The self&#8208;assembly of HOFs and biomacromolecules, however, challenging the interface of HOFs with biological settings. We report herein the self&#8208;assembly of nanoscale HOFs (nHOFs) to encapsulate protein for intracellular biocatalysis. We show that the self&#8208;assembly of tetrakis(4&#8208;amidiniumphenyl)methane and azobenzenedicarboxylate can encapsulate protein in&#8208;situ to form protein@nHOFs under mild condition. This strategy is generally applicable to proteins with different surface charge and molecular weight, showing a high protein encapsulation efficiency and minimal effect on protein activity. Cellular delivery study demonstrates that the protein@TA&#8208;HOFs can efficiently enter cells and remain enzyme activity for biochemical catalysis in living cells for neuroprotection. Collectively, our strategy paves new avenues for interfacing nHOFs with biological settings, it will shed light on expanding nHOFs as a novel platform for biomacromolecule delivery and disease treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>A family of heterobimetallic cubes shows spin&#8208;crossover behaviour near room temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using 4&#8208;(4&#8217;&#8208;pyridyl)aniline as a simple organic building block in combination with three different aldehyde components together with metal(II) salts gave three different Fe  8  Pt  6  &#8208;cubes and their corresponding Zn  8  Pt  6  analogues by employing the subcomponent self&#8208;assembly approach. Whereas the use of zinc(II) salts gave rise to diamagnetic cages, iron(II) salts yielded metallosupramolecular cages that show spin&#8208;crossover behaviour in solution. The spin&#8208;transition temperature T  1/2  depends on the incorporated aldehyde component, giving a construction kit for the deliberate synthesis of spin&#8208;crossover compounds with tailored transition properties. Incorporation of 4&#8208;thiazolecarbaldehyde or  N  &#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;imidazole&#8208;carbaldehyde yielded cages that undergo spin&#8208;crossover around room temperature whereas the cage obtained using 1  H  &#8208;4&#8208;imidazolecarbaldehyde shows a spin&#8208;transition at low temperatures.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Using 4-(4&#8217;-pyridyl)aniline as a simple organic building block in combination with three different aldehyde components together with metal(II) salts gave three different Fe  8  Pt  6  -cubes and their corresponding Zn  8  Pt  6  analogues by employing the subcomponent self-assembly approach. Whereas the use of zinc(II) salts gave rise to diamagnetic cages, iron(II) salts yielded metallosupramolecular cages that show spin-crossover behaviour in solution. The spin-transition temperature T  1/2  depends on the incorporated aldehyde component, giving a construction kit for the deliberate synthesis of spin-crossover compounds with tailored transition properties. Incorporation of 4-thiazolecarbaldehyde or  N  -methyl-2-imidazole-carbaldehyde yielded cages that undergo spin-crossover around room temperature whereas the cage obtained using 1  H  -4-imidazolecarbaldehyde shows a spin-transition at low temperatures. Three new structures were characterized by synchrotron X-ray diffraction and all structures were characterized by mass spectrometry, NMR and UV-Vis spectroscopy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Influence of intracrystalline ionic strength in MFI zeolites on aqueous phase dehydration of methylcyclohexanols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The impact of the concentration of hydrated hydronium ions and in turn of the local ionic strength in MFI zeolites has been investigated for the aqueous phase dehydration of 4&#8208;methylcyclohexanol (E1 mechanism) and  cis  &#8208;2&#8208;methylcyclohexanol (E2 mechanism). The E2 pathway with the latter alcohol led to a 2.5&#8208;fold higher activity. The catalytic activity normalized to the hydronium ions (turnover frequency, TOF) passed through a pronounced maximum, which is attributed to the increasing excess chemical potential of the alcohols in the pores, increasing in parallel with the ionic strength and the additional work caused by repulsive interactions and charge separation induced by the bulky alcohols. While the maximum in rate observed is invariant with the mechanism or substitution, the reaction pathway is influencing the activation parameters differently.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling a ligand&#8208;induced twist of a homodimeric enzyme by pulsed electron&#8211;electron double resonance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanistic insights into protein&#8211;ligand interactions can yield chemical tools for modulating protein function and enable their use for therapeutic purposes. For the homodimeric enzyme tRNA&#8208;guanine transglycosylase (TGT), a putative virulence target of shigellosis, ligand binding has been shown by crystallography to transform the functional dimer geometry into an incompetent twisted one. However, crystallographic observation of both end states does neither verify the ligand&#8208;induced transformation of one dimer into the other in solution nor does it shed light on the underlying transformation mechanism. We addressed these questions in an approach that combines site&#8208;directed spin labeling (SDSL) with distance measurements based on pulsed electron&#8211;electron double resonance (PELDOR or DEER) spectroscopy. We observed an equilibrium between the functional and twisted dimer that depends on the type of ligand, with a pyranose&#8208;substituted ligand being the most potent one in shifting the equilibrium toward the twisted dimer. Our experiments suggest a dissociation&#8211;association mechanism for the formation of the twisted dimer upon ligand binding.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactivity of the phosphanyl&#8208;phosphagallene, [H  2  C{N(Dipp)}]  2  PP=Ga(Nacnac) (Nacnac = HC[C(Me)N(Dipp)]  2  ; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;  i  Pr  2  C  6  H  3  ) towards a series of reagents possessing E&#8722;H bonds (primary amines, ammonia, water, phenylacetylene, phenylphosphine, and phenylsilane) is reported. Two contrasting reaction pathways are observed, determined by the polarity of the E&#8722;H bonds of the substrates. In the case of protic reagents (  &#948;&#8722;  E&#8722;H  &#948;+  ), a frustrated Lewis pair type of mechanism is operational at room temperature, in which gallium metal centre acts as a Lewis acid and the pendant phosphanyl moiety deprotonates the substrates. Interestingly, at elevated temperatures both NH  2  i  Pr and ammonia can react via a second, higher energy, pathway resulting in the hydroamination of the Ga=P bond. By contrast, with hydridic reagents (  &#948;+  E&#8722;H  &#948;&#8722;  ), such as phenylsilane, hydroelementation of the Ga=P bond is exclusively observed, in line with the polarisation of the Si&#8722;H and Ga=P bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Introducing A New Class of Sulfonyl Fluoride Hubs via Radical Chloro&#8208;Fluorosulfonylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfonyl fluorides have widespread applications in many important fields, including ligation chemistry, chemical biology, and drug discovery. Therefore, new methods to increase the synthetic efficiency and expand the available structures of sulfonyl fluorides are highly in demand. Here, we introduce a new and powerful class of sulfonyl fluoride hubs, &#946;&#8208;chloro alkenylsulfonyl fluorides (BCASF), which can be constructed via radical chloro&#8208;fluorosulfonyl difunctionalization of alkynes under photoredox conditions. BCASF molecules exhibit versatile reactivities and well undergo a series of transformations at the chloride site while keeping the sulfonyl fluoride group intact, including reduction, Suzuki coupling, Sonogashira coupling, as well as nucleophilic substitution with various nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur nucleophiles. By using BCASF as a synthetic hub, a wide range of sulfonyl fluorides becomes readily accessible, such as  cis  alkenylsulfonyl fluorides, dienylsulfonyl fluorides, and ynenylsulfonyl fluorides, which are challenging or even not possible to synthesize before with the known methods. Moreover, further application of BCASF to the late&#8208;stage modification of peptides and drugs is also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Phase&#8208;Dependent Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction on Pd3Bi Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alloying is a general strategy for modulating the electronic structures of catalyst materials. Compared to more common solid&#8208;solution alloys, intermetallic alloys feature well&#8208;defined atomic arrangements and provide the unique platform for studying the structure&#8208;performance correlations. It is, unfortunately, synthetically challenging to prepare the nanostructures of intermetallic alloys for catalysis research. In this contribution, we prepare intermetallic Pd  3  Bi nanocrystals of a uniform size via a facile solvothermal method. These nanocrystals can phase&#8208;transform into solid solution alloy via thermal annealing while retaining a similar composition and size. In 0.1 M KHCO  3  aqueous solution, the intermetallic Pd  3  Bi can selectively reduce CO  2  to formate with high selectivity (~100%) and stability even at &lt;&#8208;0.35 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, whereas the solid solution alloy has limited formate selectivity of &lt;60%. Such unique phase&#8208;dependence is understood via theoretical simulations showing that the crystallographic ordering of Pd and Bi atoms within intermetallic alloys can suppress CO poisoning and enhance the *OCHO adsorption during electrochemical CO  2  reduction to formate.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Dynamic Covalent Bond Tailored Responsive Molecular Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Responsive molecular devices based on dynamic covalent chemistry were fabricated, and the conductance measurement shows that three well&#8208;defined conductance states were observed with an ON/OFF ratio &#8776;10 in response to acid&#8208;based or photo&#8208;thermal stimuli of dynamic acyl hydrazone bond, while the ON&#8208;OFF ratio is &#8776;3 in self&#8208;assembled monolayer devices, which originate from the dynamic acyl hydrazone bond exchange and C=N isomerization.







Abstract
Responsive molecular devices are one of the core units for molecular electronics, and dynamic covalent bonds (DCBs) provide the opportunity for the fabrication of responsive molecular devices. Herein we employ a single dynamic acyl hydrazone bond to fabricate tailored molecular devices using the scanning tunneling microscopy break&#8208;junction technique (STM&#8208;BJ) and the eutectic Ga&#8208;In technique (EGaIn). We found that the single&#8208;DCB&#8208;tailored molecular devices exhibited acid&#8208;base and/or photo&#8208;thermal response with three well&#8208;defined molecular conductance states. The reversible switching has the ON/OFF ratio of &#8776;10 between each state for single&#8208;molecule junctions and &#8776;3 for the SAMs&#8208;based molecular junctions. Combined with the density functional theory calculations, we revealed that the multiple conductance states of these molecular junctions originate from the dynamic acyl hydrazone bond exchange and C=N isomerization. Our work opens the avenue towards the design of tailored single&#8208;molecule electrical devices by implanting dynamic covalent bonds in molecular architectures.

         <title>Ultralow Volume Change of P2&#8208;Type Layered Oxide Cathode for Na&#8208;Ion Batteries with Controlled Phase Transition by Regulating Distribution of Na+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The number and distribution of Na ions retained in lattice are two internal factors which affect structural evolution. Na ions can support the lattice structure like pillars, by regulating the distribution of Na ions, the process of phase transition can be controlled. As a result, the cathode can offer as high capacity as possible without obvious phase transition.







Abstract
Most P2&#8208;type layered oxides exhibit a large volume change when they are charged into high voltage, and it further leads to bad structural stability. In fact, high voltage is not the reason which causes the irreversible phase transition. There are two internal factors which affect structural evolution: the amount and distribution of Na ions retained in the lattice. Hereon, a series of layered oxides Na2/3MnxNix&#8722;1/3Co4/3&#8722;2xO2 (1/3&#8804;x&#8804;2/3) were synthesized. It is observed that different components have different structural evolutions during the charge/discharge processes, and further researches find that the distribution of Na ions in layers is the main factor. By controlling the distribution of Na ions, the phase transition process can be well controlled. As the referential component, P2&#8208;Na2/3Mn1/2Ni1/6Co1/3O2 cathode with uniform distribution of Na ions is cycled at the voltage window of 1.5&#8211;4.5&#8197;V, which exhibits a volume change as low as 1.9&#8201;%. Such a low strain is beneficial for cycling stability. The current work provides a new and effective route to regulate the structural evolution of the promising P2&#8208;type layered cathode for sodium ion batteries.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyzed reactions to construct atropisomerically enriched molecules has emerged as an important research topic in recent years.

Abstract
Atropisomeric molecules have found proven applications and have shown promising potential in chemistry and medicine. The design of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyzed reactions to construct atropisomerically enriched molecules has emerged as an important research topic in recent years. These reactions include kinetic resolutions, asymmetric desymmetrizations, central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality conversions, and cycloadditions. This Minireview evaluates and summarizes the progress in NHC&#8208;based organic catalysis for access to atropisomers, and briefly states our personal perspectives on the future advancement of this topic. NHC catalysis has provided rich and unique reaction modes that have led to success in the asymmetric synthesis of central&#8208;chiral molecules. It is expected that similar success could also be achieved in developing NHC catalysis to prepare atropisomeric molecules, including those not easily accessible by other methods.

         <title>Biomimetic Total Synthesis of Enterocin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Entering Nature's Design Office: The highly oxygenated natural product enterocin, which has to far resisted total synthetic attempts, was obtained in a biomimetic key step from triketone 1, which in turn was assembled from an L&#8208;arabinose&#8208;derived core fragment with a defined absolute configuration.







Abstract
The first chemical total synthesis of the highly oxygenated polyketide enterocin has been accomplished. The key step of the synthesis was a late&#8208;stage biomimetic reaction cascade involving two intramolecular aldol reactions in which each step proceeded in 52&#8201;% yield (averaged) and which established four of the seven stereogenic centers. The pivotal precursor for the cascade reaction was assembled from three readily available building blocks. A chiral dithioacetal with two stereogenic centers originating from L&#8208;arabinose represented the core fragment to both ends of which the other building blocks were attached by aldol reactions. The remaining stereogenic center was installed by Davis oxygenation immediately prior to the key step.

         <title>Active in Sleep: Iron Guanidine Catalyst Performs ROP on Dormant Side of ATRP</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orthogonal catalysis combining two polymerization mechanisms in a one&#8208;pot synthesis enables facile production routes to block copolymers. An iron guanidine catalyst is able to copolymerize styrene via ATRP and lactide via ROP simultaneously. By using the FeII species on the dormant side of the ATRP equilibrium for ROP both mechanisms proceed in a controlled manner without interference.







Abstract
Copolymers are the answer to property limitations of homopolymers. In order to use the full variety of monomers available, catalysts active in more than one polymerization mechanism are currently investigated. Iron guanidine catalysts have shown to be extraordinarily active in ROP of lactide and herein prove their versatility by also promoting ATRP of styrene. The presented iron complex is the first polymerizing lactide and styrene simultaneously to a defined block copolymer in a convenient one&#8208;pot synthesis. Both mechanisms work hand in hand with ROP using the dominantly present FeII species on the dormant side of the ATRP equilibrium. This orthogonal copolymerization by a benign iron catalyst opens up new pathways to biocompatible polymerization procedures broadening the scope of ATRP applications.

     alt="Active in Sleep: Iron Guanidine Catalyst Performs ROP on Dormant Side of ATRP"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orthogonal catalysis combining two polymerization mechanisms in a one-pot synthesis enables facile production routes to block copolymers. An iron guanidine catalyst is able to copolymerize styrene via ATRP and lactide via ROP simultaneously. By using the Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; species on the dormant side of the ATRP equilibrium for ROP both mechanisms proceed in a controlled manner without interference.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copolymers are the answer to property limitations of homopolymers. In order to use the full variety of monomers available, catalysts active in more than one polymerization mechanism are currently investigated. Iron guanidine catalysts have shown to be extraordinarily active in ROP of lactide and herein prove their versatility by also promoting ATRP of styrene. The presented iron complex is the first polymerizing lactide and styrene simultaneously to a defined block copolymer in a convenient one-pot synthesis. Both mechanisms work hand in hand with ROP using the dominantly present Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; species on the dormant side of the ATRP equilibrium. This orthogonal copolymerization by a benign iron catalyst opens up new pathways to biocompatible polymerization procedures broadening the scope of ATRP applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Exquisite Vesicular Nanomedicine by Paclitaxel Mediated Co&#8208;assembly with Camptothecin Prodrug</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An exquisite vesicular nanomedicine with ultrahigh drug loading content of paclitaxel (PTX) (up to 72.3&#177;1.7&#8197;wt&#8201;%) by a co&#8208;assembly strategy with another amphiphilic prodrug (Evans blue conjugated camptothecin, EB&#8208;CPT) is reported. The optimized ECX NVs exhibited a prominent synergistic effect between PTX and CPT against colorectal HCT116 cancer cells for improved combination therapy both in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
We report that the self&#8208;assembly of drug amphiphiles, Evans blue conjugated camptothecin prodrug (EB&#8208;CPT), can be modulated by another anticancer drug paclitaxel (PTX), resulting in ultrahigh quality of nanovesicles (NVs) with uniform shape and diameters of around 80&#8197;nm with the EB&#8208;CPT:PTX weight ratio of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3, denoted as ECX NVs. Significantly, the co&#8208;assembly of EB&#8208;CPT and PTX without adding other excipients has nearly 100&#8201;% drug loading efficiency (DLE) and ultrahigh drug loading content (DLC) of PTX alone of up to 72.3&#177;1.7&#8197;wt&#8201;% which, to our best knowledge, is among the highest level reported in literature. Moreover, the ECX NVs with the EB&#8208;CPT:PTX weight ratio of 1:2 showed remarkable combination index of 0.59 at a level of 50&#8201;% efficacy against HCT116 cells in vitro and greatly improved tumor inhibition effect in vivo compared with two clinically approved CPT&#8208; and PTX&#8208;based anticancer nanomedicines (Onivyde and Abraxane) individually and their combinations.

         <title>High Mobility Organic Lasing Semiconductor with Crystallization&#8208;Enhanced Emission for Light&#8208;Emitting Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high mobility organic lasing semiconductor of 2,7&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorene (LD&#8208;1) with crystallization&#8208;enhanced emission is demonstrated. The light emitting transistor based on an individual LD&#8208;1 nanowire crystal gives typical electrically induced emission. This work provides a new concept for developing superior organic lasering semiconductors to advance research of electrically&#8208;driven ultrasmall integrated optoelectronic devices and circuits.







Abstract
The development of high mobility organic laser semiconductors with strong emission is of great scientific and technical importance, but challenging. Herein, we present a high mobility organic laser semiconductor, 2,7&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorene (LD&#8208;1) showing unique crystallization&#8208;enhanced emission guided by elaborately modulating its crystal growth process. The obtained one&#8208;dimensional nanowires of LD&#8208;1 show outstanding integrated properties including: high absolute photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) approaching 80&#8201;%, high charge carrier mobility of 0.08&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, Fabry&#8208;Perot lasing characters with a low threshold of 86&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a high&#8208;quality factor of &#8776;2400. Furthermore, electrically induced emission was obtained from an individual LD&#8208;1 crystal nanowire&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting transistor due to the recombination of holes and electrons simultaneously injected into the nanowire, which provides a good platform for the study of electrically pumped organic lasers and other related ultrasmall integrated electrical&#8208;driven photonic devices.

         <title>Radical Stabilization of a Tripyridinium&#8211;Triazine Molecule Enables Reversible Storage of Multiple Electrons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tripyridinium&#8211;triazine molecule featuring multiple redox centers was developed with a capacity as high as six electrons per molecule. The electronic coupling between the pyridinium and triazine units can effectively delocalize the charge of the radicals, thereby stabilizing the reactive intermediate and enabling reversible storage of multiple electrons.







Abstract
A novel organic molecule, 2,4,6&#8208;tris[1&#8208;(trimethylamonium)propyl&#8208;4&#8208;pyridiniumyl]&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine hexachloride, was developed as a reversible six&#8208;electron storage electrolyte for use in an aqueous redox flow battery (ARFB). Physicochemical characterization reveals that the molecule evolves from a radical to a biradical and finally to a quinoid structure upon accepting four electrons. Both the diffusion coefficient and the rate constant were sufficiently high to run a flow battery with low concentration and kinetics polarization losses. In a demonstration unit, the assembled flow battery affords a high specific capacity of 33.0&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&#8722;1 and a peak power density of 273&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work highlights the rational design of electroactive organics that can manipulate multi&#8208;electron transfer in a reversible way, which will pave the way to development of energy&#8208;dense, manageable and low&#8208;cost ARFBs.

         <title>Unmasking Steps in Intramolecular Aromatic Hydroxylation by a Synthetic Nonheme Oxoiron(IV) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nonheme FeIV=O complex 2&#8208;syn (in green circle) can be generated from the reaction of its precursor [FeII(Bn3MC)]2+ (1) with an oxo&#8208;transfer agent. At 25&#8201;&#176;C, 2&#8208;syn decays to form the major FeIII&#8722;OAr oxidation product 3 (in blue circle) and regenerates its FeII(Bn3MC)2+ precursor (in red circle) in a 2:1 ratio. This observed stoichiometry demonstrates for the first time the electron flow required to effect this novel transformation.







Abstract
In this study, a methyl group on the classic tetramethylcyclam (TMC) ligand framework is replaced with a benzylic group to form the metastable [FeIV(Osyn)(Bn3MC)]2+ (2&#8208;syn; Bn3MC=1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;4,8,11&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,4,8,11&#8208;tetraazacyclotetradecane) species at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. The decay of 2&#8208;syn with time at 25&#8201;&#176;C allows the unprecedented monitoring of the steps involved in the intramolecular hydroxylation of the ligand phenyl ring to form the major FeIII&#8722;OAr product 3. At the same time, the FeII(Bn3MC)2+ (1) precursor to 2&#8208;syn is re&#8208;generated in a 1:2 molar ratio relative to 3, accounting for the first time for all the electrons involved and all the Fe species derived from 2&#8208;syn as shown in the following balanced equation: 3&#8201;[FeIV(O)(LPh)]2+ (2&#8208;syn)&#8594;2&#8201;[FeIII(LOAr)]2+ (3)+[FeII(LPh)]2+ (1)+H2O. This system thus serves as a paradigm for aryl hydroxylation by FeIV=O oxidants described thus far. It is also observed that 2&#8208;syn can be intercepted by certain hydrocarbon substrates, thereby providing a means to assess the relative energetics of aliphatic and aromatic C&#8722;H hydroxylation in this system.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Computational Evaluation of Low Symmetry Pd2L4 Cages to Aid in System Design**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards the development of sophisticated metal&#8208;organic hosts, low&#8208;symmetry metallo&#8208;supramolecular cages assembled from unsymmetrical ligands are of emerging interest. Designing systems to avoid forming isomeric mixtures, however, is challenging. We report the use of a rapid computational workflow to predict self&#8208;assembly outcomes, informing experimental decisions and optimising synthetic realisation of low&#8208;symmetry, cis&#8208;Pd2L4 cages.







Abstract
Unsymmetrical ditopic ligands can self&#8208;assemble into reduced&#8208;symmetry Pd2L4 metallo&#8208;cages with anisotropic cavities, with implications for high specificity and affinity guest&#8208;binding. Mixtures of cage isomers can form, however, resulting in undesirable system heterogeneity. It is paramount to be able to design components that preferentially form a single isomer. Previous data suggested that computational methods could predict with reasonable accuracy whether unsymmetrical ligands would preferentially self&#8208;assemble into single cage isomers under constraints of geometrical mismatch. We successfully apply a collaborative computational and experimental workflow to mitigate costly trial&#8208;and&#8208;error synthetic approaches. Our rapid computational workflow constructs unsymmetrical ligands and their Pd2L4 cage isomers, ranking the likelihood for exclusively forming cis&#8208;Pd2L4 assemblies. From this narrowed search space, we successfully synthesised four new, low&#8208;symmetry, cis&#8208;Pd2L4 cages.

         <title>Mechanistic Study of the Aqueous Reaction of Organic Peroxides with HSO3&#8722; on the Surface of a Water Droplet</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The organic peroxide&#8211;HSO3&#8722; reaction at the aqueous surface proceeds through two pathways, leading to the formation of inorganic and organic sulfates, respectively. The results have important atmospheric implications.







Abstract
Aqueous reactions between organic peroxides and SO2 are of intense interest in atmospheric science because of their ubiquitous implications for sulfate formation in secondary aerosols. However, the relative yields of the reaction products (inorganic vs. organic sulfates) remain controversial (i.e., 90&#8201;% vs. 40&#8211;70&#8201;% for inorganic sulfate) due in part to the lack of understanding of the underlying reaction mechanisms. Here, our computational results suggest that the reactions of HSO3&#8722; (dissolved SO2) with organic peroxides are initiated on the surface of water nanodroplets and then proceed under two reaction pathways, in which the S atom of HSO3&#8722; attacks either the O1 or O2 atom of the peroxide group &#8208;O(O2)O(O1)H, leading to the formation of inorganic and organic sulfates, respectively. Notably, we find that thse reaction initiated by O1 atom exhibits a relatively low energy barrier and high reaction rate, which favours the formation of inorganic sulfate.

         <title>Hemicyanine&#8208;Based Near&#8208;Infrared Activatable Probes for Imaging and Diagnosis of Diseases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared fluorescent hemicyanines, known for their structural diversity, high fluorescence quantum yields, and good biocompatibility, are attractive scaffolds for the construction of activatable optical probes for disease diagnosis. This Review discusses the design strategies and sensing mechanisms of these probes, with an emphasis on their applications in early disease detection and imaging&#8208;guided therapies.







Abstract
Molecular activatable probes with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence play a critical role in in vivo imaging of biomarkers for drug screening and disease diagnosis. With structural diversity and high fluorescence quantum yields, hemicyanine dyes have emerged as a versatile scaffold for the construction of activatable optical probes. This Review presents a survey of hemicyanine&#8208;based NIR activatable probes (HNAPs) for in vivo imaging and early diagnosis of diseases. The molecular design principles of HNAPs towards activatable optical signaling against various biomarkers are discussed with a focus on their broad applications in the detection of diseases including inflammation, acute organ failure, skin diseases, intestinal diseases, and cancer. This progress not only proves the unique value of HNAPs in preclinical research but also highlights their high translational potential in clinical diagnosis.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed One&#8208;Pot Asymmetric Difunctionalization of Alkynes to Access Chiral gem&#8208;(Borylsilyl)alkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed sequential hydrosilylation/hydroboration of alkynes is developed to access synthetically versatile chiral gem&#8208;(borylsilyl)alkanes with Co(acac)2 and (R,R)&#8208;Me&#8208;Ferrocelane. A range of terminal alkynes react to afford the corresponding gem&#8208;(borylsilyl)alkanes with excellent enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Enantioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot hydrosilylation and hydroboration of terminal alkynes has been developed employing a cobalt catalyst generated from Co(acac)2 and (R,R)&#8208;Me&#8208;Ferrocelane. A variety of terminal alkynes undergo this asymmetric transformation, affording the corresponding gem&#8208;(borylsilyl)alkane products with high enantioselectivity (up to 98&#8201;% ee). This one&#8208;pot reaction combines (E)&#8208;selective hydrosilylation of alkynes and consecutive enantioselective hydroboration of (E)&#8208;vinylsilanes with one chiral cobalt catalyst. This protocol represents the most straightforward approach to access versatile chiral gem&#8208;(borylsilyl)alkanes from readily available alkynes with commercially available cobalt salt and chiral ligand.

         <title>Understanding and Engineering the Stereoselectivity of Humulene Synthase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AsR6 is a type I sesquiterpene cyclase with very low homology to other terpene cyclases. It has a unique bi&#8208;magnesium diphosphate binding site and thus lacks the canonical terpene cyclase aspartate&#8208;rich signature sequences. One magnesium is replaced by the &#1013;&#8208;ammonium ion of a conserved lysine. AsR6 can use FPP and both enantiomers of NPP as substrate. In addition, a single mutation directs formation of 2E or 2Z humulene with very high selectivity.







Abstract
The non&#8208;canonical terpene cyclase AsR6 is responsible for the formation of 2E,6E,9E&#8208;humulene during the biosynthesis of the tropolone sesquiterpenoid (TS) xenovulene A. The structures of unliganded AsR6 and of AsR6 in complex with an in crystallo cyclized reaction product and thiolodiphosphate reveal a new farnesyl diphosphate binding motif that comprises a unique binuclear Mg2+&#8208;cluster and an essential K289 residue that is conserved in all humulene synthases involved in TS formation. Structure&#8208;based site&#8208;directed mutagenesis of AsR6 and its homologue EupR3 identify a single residue, L285/M261, that controls the production of either 2E,6E,9E&#8208; or 2Z,6E,9E&#8208;humulene. A possible mechanism for the observed stereoselectivity was investigated using different isoprenoid precursors and results demonstrate that M261 has gatekeeping control over product formation.

         <title>Mass Spectrometry Imaging Reveals In Situ Behaviors of Multiple Components in Aerosol Particles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel mass spectrometry imaging strategy to map and quantify the sub&#8208;organ distribution and translocation of inhaled carbonaceous aerosol is reported. The method provides not only spatial biodistribution of carbonaceous aerosol at sub&#8208;organ level, but also chemical changes of multiple components.







Abstract
The inhalation of atmospheric particles is deleterious to human health. However, as a complex mixture, tracing the behaviors of multiple components from real aerosol particles is crucial but unachievable by the existing methods. Here, taking advantage of the intrinsic fingerprints of elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC) in carbonaceous aerosol (CA) upon laser irradiation, we proposed a label&#8208;free mass spectrometry imaging method to visualize and quantify the deposition, translocation and component variation of CA in organs. With this method, the heterogeneous deposition, clearance and release behavior of CA in lung, that more OC was released in parenchyma and OC was cleared faster than EC, was observed. The translocation of CA to extrapulmonary organs including kidney, liver, spleen and even brain was also verified and quantified. By comparing the ratio of OC to EC, an organ&#8208;specific release behavior of OC from CA during circulation was revealed. In orthotopic lung and liver tumor, OC was found to penetrate more into tumor foci than EC. This technique provides deeper information for understanding the systemic health effects of aerosol particles.

         <title>Synergy and Antagonism between Allosteric and Active&#8208;Site Inhibitors of Abl Tyrosine Kinase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a better understanding of the interaction between allosteric and ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors of Abl. Using a protease accessibility assay we developed, we determined the global conformation of Abl when bound to Abl inhibitors. We found that synergy between ATP&#8208;competitive and allosteric inhibitors of Abl required a &#8220;matched&#8221; kinase conformation.







Abstract
Allosteric inhibitors of Abl kinase are being explored in the clinic, often in combination with ATP&#8208;site inhibitors of Abl kinase. However, there are conflicting data on whether both ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors and myristoyl&#8208;site allosteric inhibitors can simultaneously bind Abl kinase. Here, we determine whether there is synergy or antagonism between ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors and allosteric inhibitors of Abl. We observe that clinical ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors are not synergistic with allosteric ABL inhibitors, however, conformation&#8208;selective ATP&#8208;site inhibitors that modulate the global conformation of Abl can afford synergy. We demonstrate that kinase conformation is the key driver to simultaneously bind two compounds to Abl kinase. Finally, we explore the interaction of allosteric and conformation selective ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors in a series of biochemical and cellular assays.

         <title>In Vivo Tracking of Cell Viability for Adoptive Natural Killer Cell&#8208;Based Immunotherapy by Ratiometric NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a ROS&#8208;sensitive NIR&#8208;II fluorescence probe to label NK cells was reported for tracking cell viability in adoptive NK cell&#8208;based immunotherapy. Intracellular ROS generation of dying NK cells, caused by exogenous physical or chemical factors, such as hypoxia, starvation, and oxidative stress in the tumor microenvironment, results in a ratiometric NIR&#8208;II fluorescence signal in vivo, which holds considerable potential for adoptive NK cell&#8208;based immunotherapy.







Abstract
The therapeutic efficacy of natural killer (NK) cells&#8208;based immunotherapy is greatly related with the survival of transplanted NK cells. However, no effective strategy was reported to monitor NK cell viability in adoptive immunotherapy in vivo. Herein, we develop a ratiometric NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging strategy to quantitively track and visualize the adoptive NK cell viability in vivo in real&#8208;time. The nanoprobe consists of lanthanide&#8208;based down&#8208;conversion nanoparticles (DCNP) coated with IR786s, a reactive oxygen species (ROS) sensitive to NIR dye, which was directly labeled with NK cells. Upon cell death, the excessive ROS generation occurred within NK cells, along with IR786s degradation, turning on NIR&#8208;II fluorescent signal at 1550&#8197;nm of DCNP under 808&#8208;nm excitation, while the fluorescent signal at 1550&#8197;nm of DCNP under 980&#8208;nm excitation was stable. Such an intracellular ROS&#8208;induced ratiometric NIR&#8208;II fluorescent signal was validated to correlate well with NK cell viability in vivo. Using this nanoreporter, we further demonstrated that co&#8208;treatment with IL&#8208;2, IL&#8208;15, and IL&#8208;21 could improve NK cell viability in vivo, achieving enhanced immunotherapy for orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma. Overall, this strategy allows for longitudinal and quantitative tracking of NK cell viability in NK cell&#8208;based immunotherapy.

         <title>Advanced Electrolyte Design for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Li&#8208;Metal Batteries under Practical Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) have attracted worldwide attention owing to the high energy density of Li&#8208;metal anodes. Nevertheless, the actual energy density of LMBs is often inferior to that of Li&#8208;ion batteries. This Review describes crucial parameters of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LMBs, summarizes the recent advances in electrolyte systems for practical LMBs, and provides new perspectives for the design of novel electrolytes for LMBs.







Abstract
Given the limitations inherent in current intercalation&#8208;based Li&#8208;ion batteries, much research attention has focused on potential successors to Li&#8208;ion batteries such as lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries and lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8208;O2) batteries. In order to realize the potential of these batteries, the use of metallic lithium as the anode is essential. However, there are severe safety hazards associated with the growth of Li dendrites, and the formation of &#8220;dead Li&#8221; during cycles leads to the inevitable loss of active Li, which in the end is undoubtedly detrimental to the actual energy density of Li&#8208;metal batteries. For Li&#8208;metal batteries under practical conditions, a low negative/positive ratio (N/P ratio), a electrolyte/cathode ratio (E/C ratio) along with a high&#8208;voltage cathode is prerequisite. In this Review, we summarize the development of new electrolyte systems for Li&#8208;metal batteries under practical conditions, revisit the design criteria of advanced electrolytes for practical Li&#8208;metal batteries and provide perspectives on future development of electrolytes for practical Li&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>A High&#8208;Voltage Zn&#8211;Organic Battery Using a Nonflammable Organic Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;voltage Zn&#8211;organic battery using a nonflammable organic electrolyte shows a long lifetime (2400&#8197;cycles) even with a high mass&#8208;loading of 16&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in the cathode and high Zn&#8208;utilization (3.5&#8201;%) in the anode. TFMS=trifluoromethanesulfonate, TEP=triethyl phosphate, PC=propylene carbonate.







Abstract
Owing to undesired Zn corrosion and the formation of Zn dendrites in aqueous electrolytes, most of the examples of aqueous Zn batteries with reported excellent performance are achieved with low Zn&#8208;utilization (&lt;0.6&#8201;%) in the anode and low mass&#8208;loading (&lt;3&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in the cathode. Herein, we propose a new organic electrolyte for Zn batteries, which contains a zinc trifluoromethanesulfonate (Zn&#8208;TFMS) salt and a mixed solvent consisting of propylene carbonate (PC) and triethyl phosphate (TEP). We demonstrate that this electrolyte with an optimized PC/TEP ratio not only exhibits high ionic conductivity and a wide stable potential window, but also facilitates dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping. In particular, the TEP solvent makes the electrolyte nonflammable. Finally, a 2&#8197;V Zn//polytriphenylamine composite (PTPAn) battery is fabricated with the optimized electrolyte; it shows a high rate and a long lifetime (2400&#8197;cycles) even with a high mass&#8208;loading (16&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) of PTPAn in the cathode and with a high Zn&#8208;utilization (3.5&#8201;%).

         <title>Pyrolysis&#8208;Free Synthesized Catalyst towards Acidic Oxygen Reduction by Deprotonation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalyst possessing well&#8208;defined active sites and intrinsic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction was prepared by a pyrolysis&#8208;free route. The performance of the catalyst was explored in acidic media by introducing a deprotonation process.







Abstract
Acidic oxygen reduction is vital for renewable energy devices such as fuel cells. However, many aspects of the catalytic process are still uncertain&#8212;especially the large difference in activity in acidic and alkaline media. Thus, the design and synthesis of model catalysts to determine the active centers and the inactivation mechanism are urgently needed. We report a pyrolysis&#8208;free synthesis route to fabricate a catalyst (CPF&#8208;Fe@NG) for oxygen reduction in acidic conditions. By introducing a deprotonation process, we extended the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity from alkaline to acidic conditions. CPF&#8208;Fe@NG demonstrated outstanding performance with a half&#8208;wave potential of 853&#8197;mV (vs. RHE) and good stability after 10000&#8197;cycles in 1&#8197;M HClO4. The pyrolysis&#8208;free route could also be used to assemble fuel cells, with a maximum power density of 126&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Our findings offer new insights into the ORR process to optimize catalysts for both mechanistic studies and practical applications.

         <title>A Minimal Load&#8208;and&#8208;Lock RuII Luminescent DNA Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using single&#8208;molecule optical tweezers and confocal microscopy we perform kinetic analysis of a novel dinuclear ruthenium(II) DNA imaging probe. Reversable binding is observed on relaxed DNA, however on stretching DNA, threading can occur, resulting in high affinity stable binding. Threading is highly stereoisomer specific and dependent on DNA supercoiling state. This DNA probe has exciting potential for DNA structure specific imaging.







Abstract
Threading intercalators bind DNA with high affinities. Here, we describe single&#8208;molecule studies on a cell&#8208;permeant luminescent dinuclear ruthenium(II) complex that has been previously shown to thread only into short, unstable duplex structures. Using optical tweezers and confocal microscopy, we show that this complex threads and locks into force&#8208;extended duplex DNA in a two&#8208;step mechanism. Detailed kinetic studies reveal that an individual stereoisomer of the complex exhibits the highest binding affinity reported for such a mono&#8208;intercalator. This stereoisomer better preserves the biophysical properties of DNA than the widely used SYTOX Orange. Interestingly, threading into torsionally constrained DNA decreases dramatically, but is rescued on negatively supercoiled DNA. Given the &#8220;light&#8208;switch&#8221; properties of this complex on binding DNA, it can be readily used as a long&#8208;lived luminescent label for duplex or negatively supercoiled DNA through a unique &#8220;load&#8208;and&#8208;lock&#8221; protocol.

         <title>Fuel&#8208;Driven and Enzyme&#8208;Regulated Redox&#8208;Responsive Supramolecular Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fuel&#8208;driven and enzyme&#8208;regulated supramolecular hydrogel has the inherent ability to tune its behavior from a redox&#8208;responsive to a self&#8208;regulating system. Feedback arises due to in situ formation of oxidation fuel in the chemical reaction network.







Abstract
Chemical reaction networks (CRN) embedded in hydrogels can transform responsive materials into complex self&#8208;regulating materials that generate feedback to counter the effect of external stimuli. This study presents hydrogels containing the &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (CD) and ferrocene (Fc) host&#8211;guest pair as supramolecular crosslinks where redox&#8208;responsive behavior is driven by the enzyme&#8211;fuel couples horse radish peroxidase (HRP)&#8211;H2O2 and glucose oxidase (GOx)&#8211;d&#8208;glucose. The hydrogel can be tuned from a responsive to a self&#8208;regulating supramolecular system by varying the concentration of added reduction fuel d&#8208;glucose. The onset of self&#8208;regulating behavior is due to formation of oxidation fuel in the hydrogel by a cofactor intermediate GOx[FADH2]. UV/Vis spectroscopy, rheology, and kinetic modeling were employed to understand the emergence of out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium behavior and reveal the programmable negative feedback response of the hydrogel, including the adaptation of its elastic modulus and its potential as a glucose sensor.

         <title>Catalytic SNAr Hydroxylation and Alkoxylation of Aryl Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydroxylation of aryl fluorides via &#951;6&#8208;coordination was achieved. This method was also applicable in the alkoxylation. A Meisenheimer&#8208;type intermediate was successfully isolated and well characterized. Density functional theory calculations and mechanistic studies suggested a stepwise or stepwise&#8208;like energy profile for the SNAr reaction.







Abstract
Nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) is a powerful strategy for incorporating a heteroatom into an aromatic ring by displacement of a leaving group with a nucleophile, but this method is limited to electron&#8208;deficient arenes. We have now established a reliable method for accessing phenols and phenyl alkyl ethers via catalytic SNAr reactions. The method is applicable to a broad array of electron&#8208;rich and neutral aryl fluorides, which are inert under classical SNAr conditions. Although the mechanism of SNAr reactions involving metal arene complexes is hypothesized to involve a stepwise pathway (addition followed by elimination), experimental data that support this hypothesis is still under exploration. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations suggest either a stepwise or stepwise&#8208;like energy profile. Notably, we isolated a rhodium &#951;5&#8208;cyclohexadienyl complex intermediate with an sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon bearing both a nucleophile and a leaving group.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Regulated Electron Transfer and Exchange&#8208;Enhanced Reactivity in Fe4S4&#8208;Mediated Redox Reaction of the Dph2 Enzyme During the Biosynthesis of Diphthamide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We uncovered that the spin&#8208;regulated electron transfer and exchange&#8208;enhanced reactivity are involved in Fe4S4&#8208;mediated reductive cleavage of the S&#8722;C(&#947;) bond in Dph2, and that the Fe1&#8208;Fe2&#8208;Fe3 block may act as the redox site to mediate the electron donation and reception during the redox catalysis.







Abstract
The [4Fe&#8208;4S]&#8208;dependent radical S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) proteins is one of large families of redox enzymes that are able to carry a panoply of challenging transformations. Despite the extensive studies of structure&#8211;function relationships of radical SAM (RS) enzymes, the electronic state&#8208;dependent reactivity of the [4Fe&#8208;4S] cluster in these enzymes remains elusive. Using combined MD simulations and QM/MM calculations, we deciphered the electronic state&#8208;dependent reactivity of the [4Fe&#8208;4S] cluster in Dph2, a key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of diphthamide. Our calculations show that the reductive cleavage of the S&#8722;C(&#947;) bond is highly dependent on the electronic structure of [4Fe&#8208;4S]. Interestingly, the six electronic states can be classified into a low&#8208;energy and a high&#8208;energy groups, which are correlated with the net spin of Fe4 atom ligated to SAM. Due to the driving force of Fe4&#8722;C(&#947;) bonding, the net spin on the Fe4 moiety dictate the shift of the opposite spin electron from the Fe1&#8208;Fe2&#8208;Fe3 block to SAM. Such spin&#8208;regulated electron transfer results in the exchange&#8208;enhanced reactivity in the lower&#8208;energy group compared with those in the higher&#8208;energy group. This reactivity principle provides fundamental mechanistic insights into reactivities of [4Fe&#8208;4S] cluster in RS enzymes.

         <title>Aptamer&#8208;PROTAC Conjugates (APCs) for Tumor&#8208;Specific Targeting in Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first aptamer&#8208;PROTAC conjugate (APC) was designed to improve the tumor specific targeting and in vivo antitumor potency of conventional PROTACs. This strategy may pave the way for the design of tumor&#8208;specific targeting PROTACs and have broad applications in PROTAC&#8208;based drug development.







Abstract
Development of proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) is emerging as a promising strategy for targeted protein degradation. However, the drug development using the heterobifunctional PROTAC molecules is generally limited by poor membrane permeability, low in vivo efficacy and indiscriminate distribution. Herein an aptamer&#8208;PROTAC conjugation approach was developed as a novel strategy to improve the tumor&#8208;specific targeting ability and in vivo antitumor potency of conventional PROTACs. As proof of concept, the first aptamer&#8208;PROTAC conjugate (APC) was designed by conjugating a BET&#8208;targeting PROTAC to the nucleic acid aptamer AS1411 (AS) via a cleavable linker. Compared with the unmodified BET PROTAC, the designed molecule (APR) showed improved tumor targeting ability in a MCF&#8208;7 xenograft model, leading to enhanced in vivo BET degradation and antitumor potency and decreased toxicity. Thus, the APC strategy may pave the way for the design of tumor&#8208;specific targeting PROTACs and have broad applications in the development of PROTAC&#8208;based drugs.

         <title>TEMPO Containing Radical Polymonothiocarbonate Polymers with Regio&#8208; and Stereo&#8208;Regularities: Synthesis, Characterization, and Electrical Conductivity Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation of atactic and isotactic radical polymonothiocarbonates by the copolymerization of a TEMPO derived epoxide and carbonyl sulfide (COS) in the presence of the metal catalyst (salen)CrCl/PPNCl is reported. It was uncovered that there is a significant enhancement of the electrical conductivity of the isotactic copolymer (ca. 10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) as compared to that of the atactic copolymer (10&#8722;7&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1).







Abstract
We report the synthesis of a (2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxidanyl) (TEMPO) appended polymonothiocarbonates through the ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of (4&#8208;glycidyloxy&#8208;2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl) (GTEMPO) in the presence of carbonyl sulfide under ambient conditions. We have prepared the atactic and isotactic versions of this polymer, using enantiopure R or S forms of the GTEMPO monomer in the latter instances. Cyclic voltammetry studies revealed both oxidation and reduction events that were characteristic of TEMPO radicals. Electrical conductivity of these polymers was measured as solid&#8208;state films after annealing the samples above their glass transition temperatures. At room temperature the isotactic polymer shows much greater conductivity (ca. 10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) than the atactic (ca. 10&#8722;7&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), attributed to the well&#8208;defined stereochemistry and regulated charge transport pathway of isotactic polymer chains in contrast to the irregular structure of the atactic counterpart.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Nonoxidative Coupling of Methane Using Stable Solid Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and robust light&#8208;driven nonoxidative coupling of methane (NOCM) to ethane and hydrogen at room temperature was developed. The noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free GaN:ZnO solid solution drove NOCM with a high conversion rate, high selectivity, long&#8208;term stability, and superior coke resistance, which are difficult to achieve simultaneously in thermal catalysis.







Abstract
Achieving efficient and direct conversion of methane under mild conditions is of great significance for innovations in the chemical industry. However, the efficiency and lifetime of most catalysts remain too far from practical requirements, since it is difficult to break the first C&#8722;H bond of methane as well as to suppress the following complete dehydrogenation (or overoxidation) and the resulting carbonaceous deposition (or CO2). Here, we report that wurtzite GaN:ZnO solid solutions exhibit unique and unprecedented photocatalytic performances for the nonoxidative coupling of methane at room temperature, exclusively generating ethane with nearly stoichiometric H2. High conversion rate (&gt;330&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), long&#8208;term stability (&gt;70&#8197;h), and superior coke&#8208;resistance were achieved. At 293&#8197;K, the methane conversion exceeds 7&#8201;%, comparable to the equilibrium conversion of thermal catalysis at 910&#8197;K. Mechanistic studies revealed that the N&#8208;ZnGa&#8208;ON units and the absence of acid sites on the surface played crucial roles in reactivity and coke resistance, respectively.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Protected Au55 with a Novel Structure and Remarkable CO2 Electroreduction Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The gold nanocluster [Au55(p&#8208;MBT)24(Ph3P)6](SbF6)3 (p&#8208;MBT=4&#8208;methylbenzenethiolate) features a face&#8208;centered cubic Au55 kernel. This cluster exhibits high catalytic activity and selectivity for electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO, and the Faradaic efficiency (FE) reaches 94.1&#8201;% at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V. The exclusion of chloride is an effective strategy to generate new members of ligand&#8208;protected metal nanoclusters.







Abstract
A Au55 nanocluster with the composition of [Au55(p&#8208;MBT)24(Ph3P)6](SbF6)3 (p&#8208;MBT=4&#8208;methylbenzenethiolate) is synthesized via direct reduction of gold&#8208;phosphine and gold&#8208;thiolate precursors. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals that this Au55 nanocluster features a face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) Au55 kernel, different from the well&#8208;known two&#8208;shell cuboctahedral arrangement in Au55(Ph3P)12Cl6. The Au55 cluster shows a wide optical absorption band with optical energy gap (Eg=1.28&#8197;eV). It is found that the exclusion of chloride is crucial for the formation of the title cluster, otherwise rod&#8208;like [Au25(SR)5(PPh3)10Cl2]2+ is obtained. The strategy to run synthetic reaction in the absence of halide leads to new members of phosphine/thiolate co&#8208;protected metal nanoclusters. The Au55 nanocluster exhibits high catalytic activity and selectivity for electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO; the Faradaic efficiency (FE) reaches 94.1&#8201;% at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).

         <title>Controlling the Covalent Reactivity of a Kinase Inhibitor with Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

To increase the tissue selectivity of kinase inhibitors, we introduce the combination of covalent inhibitors, targeting a cysteine in the vicinity of the ATP binding site of the c&#8208;Jun N&#8208;terminal kinase 3 (JNK3) and diazocine photoswitches. X&#8208;ray crystallography shows that our lead inhibitor is a poor non&#8208;covalent inhibitor in the dark and undergoes proximity&#8208;based covalent attachment following irradiation with visible light.







Abstract
Covalent kinase inhibitors account for some of the most successful drugs that have recently entered the clinic and many others are in preclinical development. A common strategy is to target cysteines in the vicinity of the ATP binding site using an acrylamide electrophile. To increase the tissue selectivity of kinase inhibitors, it could be advantageous to control the reactivity of these electrophiles with light. Here, we introduce covalent inhibitors of the kinase JNK3 that function as photoswitchable affinity labels (PALs). Our lead compounds contain a diazocine photoswitch, are poor non&#8208;covalent inhibitors in the dark, and become effective covalent inhibitors after irradiation with visible light. Our proposed mode of action is supported by X&#8208;ray structures that explain why these compounds are unreactive in the dark and undergo proximity&#8208;based covalent attachment following exposure to light.

         <title>Expedient Synthesis of Bridged Bicyclic Nitrogen Scaffolds via Orthogonal Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bridged bicyclic nitrogen scaffolds are conformational restricted analogues of important aminocarbo&#8208; and aminoheterocycles. Fixation of functional groups in a biologically active conformation provides efficient and selective ligands for various targets, featuring improved ADME parameters. Long synthetic sequences relying on traditional organic chemistry currently limit the drug discovery process. New step&#8208;economic synthetic procedures are therefore highly sought after.







Abstract
Bridged nitrogen bicyclic skeletons have been accessed via unprecedented site&#8208; and diastereoselective orthogonal tandem catalysis from readily accessible reactants in a step economic manner. Directed Pd&#8208;catalyzed &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H olefination of aminocyclohexane with gem&#8208;dibromoalkenes, followed by a consecutive intramolecular Cu&#8208;catalyzed amidation of the 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;alkenylated product delivers the interesting normorphan skeleton. The tandem protocol can be applied on substituted aminocyclohexanes and aminoheterocycles, easily providing access to the corresponding substituted, aza&#8208; and oxa&#8208;analogues. The Cu catalyst of the Ullmann&#8208;Goldberg reaction additionally avoids off&#8208;cycle Pd catalyst scavenging by alkenylated reaction product. The picolinamide directing group stabilizes the enamine of the 7&#8208;alkylidenenormorphan, allowing further product post functionalizations. Without Cu catalyst, regio&#8208; and diastereoselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H olefination is achieved.
